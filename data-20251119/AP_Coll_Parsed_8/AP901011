texas gop gubernatorial nominee clayton williams called democrat 
ann richards a liar to her face thursday and former sen john 
tower said nebraska democrat jim exon has a reputation as one of 
the biggest boozers in the senate 
williams and richards were making a rare joint appearance in 
dallas tower who is from texas was in omaha to campaign on 
behalf of exons republican opponent for the senate seat former 
rep hal daub 
with less than a month to go before the nov 6 elections 
rhetoric also heated up in gubernatorial races in maine and 
michigan a supporter of gop candidate john engler michigan gov 
james blanchards tactics to hitlers maine democrat joseph 
brennan deflected criticism of pardons he gave as governor saying 
republican gov john mckernan might have needed one 
exon denied towers accusations and said he would welcome a 
senate investigation of his reputation he urged daub to renounce 
the allegations at a news conference daub declined to do so 
nebraskas other senator democrat bob kerrey called towers 
campaign activities wormlike 
tower left the senate after the 1984 elections last year 
president bush nominated him to be secretary of defense but those 
aspirations were derailed by allegations of drinking and 
womanizing exon had opposed towers nomination 
sen exon bore down on me heavily on the drinking thing when 
hes got the reputation in washington of being one of the two or 
three biggest boozers in the senate tower said on omaha radio 
station kkars program talk of the town 
were talking about reputation tower continued were 
talking about rumor specific comments that have been related to me 
by others so i would have to say that i dont have firsthand 
knowledge i would establish that because that is the fair way to 
do it 
in dallas richards and williams were on a podium at a gathering 
of the greater dallas crime commission when williams walked to 
richards side of the stage to greet supporters 
richards extended her hand but williams declined to shake it 
saying im here to call you a liar today 
thats what you are youve lied about me youve lied about 
mark white and youve lied about jim mattox im going to finish 
this deal today 
richards defeated white and mattox in a bitter democratic 
primary williams campaign has been punctuated by outspoken and 
sometimes outrageous remarks 
williams said he was angry that richards was spreading rumors in 
an attempt to link him with a federal investigation into alleged 
drug money laundering 
we think she stepped over the line it is our intention that 
ann richards is no longer able to spread her venom we want to make 
sure she is not able to destroy other peoples careers and 
reputations said campaign spoksman bill kenyon 
richards called williams comment unkind and said i think 
its important that clayton williams tell the people of texas 
exactly what kind of businessman he is 
in michigan a supporter of republican gubernatorial candidate 
john engler on tuesday said gov james blanchards tactics have 
been as effective as the third reich under hitler 
richard headlee the leader of a statewide effort to cut 
property taxes said blanchard a democrat misled voters to make 
them believe he supports property tax relief much as adolf hitler 
brainwashed the german people into supporting nazism 
englers campaign director backed away from the comment 
wednesday calling headlee a little zealous 
he was talking about the public relations machine we dont 
share dicks view on that said dan pero englers campaign 
director dick gets somewhat carried away and he used a poor 
analogy 
in maines gubernatorial race rep joseph brennan a democrat 
called republican gov john mckernan a hypocrite tuesday for 
criticizing his record on pardons as governor 
if john mckernan hadnt been lucky if the police had knocked 
on the door one night and arrested him for possession of illegal 
drugs he would have been in the exact same position of many of 
those i pardoned said brennan who was governor from 197886 
mckernan has admitted smoking marijuana in college brennan has 
said he never tried it 
mckernan has accused brennan of pardoning political friends

soldiers massacred hundreds of rwandan 
civilians belonging to the same tribe as the rebels who have 
invaded the central african nation according to refugees who 
reached uganda 
but rwandas president denied the claim and a diplomat familiar 
with the area said thursday he doubted the reports were true 
rwandan president juvenal habyarimana told a news conference 
wednesday that fourteen civilians had been killed in fighting 
between his troops and rwandan exiles who invaded from uganda on 
sept 30 
habyarimana also said 3000 people had been arrested since the 
invasion many of the detainees belong to the minority tutsi tribe 
an exiled tutsi is leading the rebel force that invaded rwanda last 
month 
the hutus who make up 85 percent of rwandas 8 million people 
wrested control of the country from the tutsi in 1959 
habyarimana denied reports from rwandan exiles that his soldiers 
had indiscriminantly fired on civilians and killed more than 1000 
people in 10 villages on the border with uganda 
some of the approximately 500 refugees who crossed into uganaa 
on tuesday made the charges according to the british broadcasting 
corp 
there was no way to escape because the soldiers cordoned off 
each village before opening fire a 45yearold man from chonio 
village told the bbc 
new vision a governmentowned newspaper in the ugandan capital 
of kampala quoted a refugee identified as stephen kabarega as 
saying soldiers were joined by civilians armed with knives hoes 
and spears in an attack on tutsi herdsmen 
the refugees said the soldiers accused them of feeding and 
supporting tutsi rebels 
the western diplomat in kigali the rwandan capital who spoke 
on condition he not be identified further said it did not appear 
that government soldiers had reached the region of the alleged 
massacre 
i dont think the massacre happened i dont think there are 
any tutsis or government soldiers in the area he said in a 
telephone interview it may be a rebel tactic 
but he said the rebel incursion could easily degenerate into a 
tribal war 
in 1963 the hutu brutally put down a tutsi uprising killing 
more than 10000 tutsis about 250000 fled north to uganda 
the invaders who call themselve the rwandese patriotic front 
spring from that refugee population they accuse habyarimana of 
failing to allow the repatriation of more than 1 million rwandan 
refugees 
the rebels are led by a former ugandan army commander maj gen 
fred rwigyema a rwandan of tutsi origin 
meanwhile the european parliament in strasbourg france 
endorsed intervention by french and belgian troops in rwanda but 
urged the troops be used only to protect french and belgian 
citizens 
belgium has rejected rwandas appeals for military aid to fight 
the invaders a belgian statement thursday accused the government 
of human rights violations 
belgium will put no troops and military equipment at the 
disposal of rwanda foreign minister mark eyskens said in 
brussels the government will remain neutral in what it considers 
an internal matter he said 
but prime minister wilfried martens said belgian paratroopers 
already in rwanda to help in evacuations might move toward the 
northeastern battle zone to protect other belgians

a us initiative in the security council 
to condemn israel for using deadly force against palestinians ran 
aground thursday over plo demands for a tougher resolution 
the security council failed to reconcile the approach of the 
united states and britain with that of the palestine liberation 
organization and the nonaligned movement despite two days of 
intensive us lobbying and marathon negotiations wednesday night 
and thursday morning 
that put the united states at the risk of having to veto the 
plobacked resolution against israel a move that would infuriate 
the arab nations president bush has been trying so hard to 
cultivate in the gulf crisis 
we have a couple of issues still to be settled us 
ambassador thomas r pickering had said as tired representatives 
ended their meetings at 4 am thursday 
sir david hannay the british un ambassador and october 
president of the security council said on nbc radio after leaving 
a meeting thursday night with pickering 
i think if we fail to get an agreement tomorrow friday that 
would be very very unsatisfactory i think tomorrow is the time 
when we must have to have a vote i think weve reached the 
end of a long negotiatiing process we ought to be ready to make a 
decision tomorrow 
thursday afternoon president bush telephoned french president 
francois mitterand whose government has said it is willing to vote 
for the plobacked resolution condemning israel the new york times 
reported friday the times quoting administration officials said 
bush told mitterrand the alliance against iraq would be hurt if the 
united states had to veto the resolution 
us agreement to condemn israel after mondays killing of 19 
palestinian demonstrators by police in jerusalem has been seen as a 
major shift in public policy toward israel the us government 
commonly shields the jewish state from condemnation by exercising 
its veto in the council 
but consultations collapsed as compromise efforts failed no 
formal meeting was held thursday 
more consultations were expected friday but it was not known if 
a vote would take place 
the security council has debated the killings since monday but 
the 15 council members cannot agree on a common approach in a 
resolution of ondemnation that would be adopted unanimously 
without a us veto 
the united states on tuesday proposed that the council condemn 
israel for using excessive force against palestinians who stoned 
jewish worshipers at the western wall or wailing wall america 
itself drafted the resolution which it described as balanced 
the us decision to join the condemnation outraged jewish 
groups which flooded the us mission to the united nations with 
phone calls 
in contrast to a nonaligned draft the us resolution blamed 
palestinian troublemakers as well as israeli security forces it 
regretted the attack on innocent worshipers and asked the un 
secretarygeneral to send personal emissaries to investigate 
but plo envoys said the us proposal was so weak and tepid they 
would be embarrassed to transmit it to their leadership in 
tunis as a reasonable working document they objected to 
apportioning blame and the reference to innocent jewish worshpers 
and complained that the us resolution made it appear the israeli 
police were merely incompetent and illtrained 
the plo and others wanted the council itself involved in the 
situation in the occupied territories captured by israel in the 
1967 mideast war and to send its own team to recommend how to 
protect palestinians from israeli mistreatment 
the united states was reported ready to veto a draft resolution 
supported by the plo and nonaligned nations as being too harsh 
ignoring palestinian violence and opening the way to council 
involvement and un observers in the occupied territories 
the council on thursday worked on a british compromise draft 
the five permanent council members the united states britain 
china france and the soviet union want to preserve the cohesion 
and unanimity that characterized most security council resolutions 
against iraq 
but the palestinian problem has proved intractible so far us 
allies the soviet union and china support elements in the us 
draft but also were ready to vote for the nonaligned resolution 
differences centered on a un investigation of the violence 
whether it should emphasize protection of palestinians and how much 
weight its recommendations should carry 
the plo originally sought an independent investigative team 
consisting of three security council members israel rejected that 
as infringing on its sovereignty 
the plo compromised and accepted a british proposal for the 
secretarygeneral to send his own emissaries to investigate israel 
has indicated it could accept such a mission 
but the plo wants to make sure that the report makes clear 
recommendations for protection of palestinians that it is made 
directly to the security council and that the council takes action

tropical storm marco toppled trees and power lines as it swept 
floridas gulf coast on thursday and heavy rain streaming northward 
from the tropics washed out roads and dams in the carolinas 
the rain was blamed for at least five deaths in the carolinas 
and may have led to a train derailment 
nearly 10 inches of rain fell in 24 hours in parts of south 
carolina with unofficial reports up to 11 inches the national 
weather service said a hurricane watch was posted for the north 
carolina coast 
bermuda felt the effects of hurricane lili with rain 
thunderstorms and gusty wind 
but while the southeast bore the brunt of the stormy weather 
thursday the entire east coast also could suffer severe weather as 
several weather systems may converge forecasters said 
theres not only marco but hurricane lili a cold front 
all converging on the east coast in the next few days said bob 
sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral gables 
he said lili was moving west and the question is how fast its 
going to recurve and approach the east coast possibly as early as 
tomorrow night sheets said all the weather conditions that 
these are creating can produce heavy rain over the east coast and 
thats of some concern 
marco pelted floridas central and southwest coast with wind up 
to 65 mph and dumped up to 5 inches of rain before it began 
weakening it was downgraded to a tropical depression with 35 mph 
winds by 6 pm edt 
schools were closed in manatee and sarasota counties where wind 
gusts up to 80 mph toppled power lines knocking out electricity to 
50000 people 
at 1030 pm edt marcos center hit land near cross city 
which is about 40 miles west of gainesville the center was near 
latitude 296 north longitude 832 west 
it was moving north at 9 mph but all tropical storm warnings 
had been dropped 
at 1030 pm edt lili was centered about 620 miles southeast 
of cape hatteras nc at 297 latitude north longitude 673 
west the storm with winds of 75 mph headed west at 23 mph and 
was expected to slow slightly and turn to the northwest 
a tropical storm warning for bermuda was discontinued 
sheets said lili possibly could hit land at the outer banks off 
north carolina this weekend but he expected to have a better idea 
by friday 
forecasters expected marco to continue its generally northward 
path 
its weakening but now the big problem is the rain said 
sheets 
rainfall amounts of 3 inches or more were expected across 
portions of north florida and south georgia 
the hurricane center posted a tornado watch for portions of 
north florida and southern georgia through the evening 
local forecasters said a tornado touched down northeast of 
floridas lake city throwing people into a lake upending mobile 
homes and felling trees across railroad tracks weather forecasters 
said 
another ripped through a housing development about 200 yards 
from a hospital near crystal river fla tearing a roof off a 
mobile home knocking down trees and power lines and closing the 
southbound lanes of us 19 
the carolinas had been drenched by the remnants of previous 
tropical weather 
three people were found drowned and a 9yearold boy was missing 
in south carolina after a dam failed late wednesday kershaw county 
coroner thomas horton said the four were riding in a car that 
stalled in high water 
two north carolina highway deaths were blamed on heavy rain 
in south carolina the rain forced the evacuations of residents 
in orangeburg and kershaw counties also dams overflowed in 
kershaw county and two bridges were undermined in kershaw and 
chesterfield counties the weather service reported 
heavier 24hour rainfall totals for south carolina included 950 
inches at honey hill and schulerville with 650 inches at cross 
and bonneau the weather service reported 
heavier totals in georgia included 770 inches at hinesville 
730 inches at jesup and 660 inches at statesboro 
in north carolina a storm total of 570 inches of rain was 
reported at kannapolis and wednesdays total of 410 inches at 
charlotte was a record for the date the weather service said 
fourteen cars of a csx freight train jumped their tracks east of 
marshville nc early thursday thirteen cars and one engine 
overturned dumping 3000 gallons of diesel fuel officials said 
no injuries were reported 
the crew seems to think the ground gave way as they were 
passing over it said norman going a spokesman for csx 
transportation based in jacksonville fla 
officials of the southwest florida water management district 
officials said 35 inches of rain from marco wasnt enough to end 
floridas drought 
it helps but not as much as people think because the rain 
comes down hard and fast and tends to run off or sit on the 
surface said spokeswoman andrea spadafora 
but the rain doused the biggest part of a 40dayold fire in the 
okefenokee swamp ignited by lightning the fire has blackened more 
than 20000 of the swamps 438000 acres 
officials at the okefenokee national wildlife refuge said peat 
moss in the swamp is likely to continue smoldering until the swamp 
floods again 
tropical storms become hurricanes if their maximum sustained 
winds top 74 mph with marco there have been 13 named storms this 
season which began june 1 and ends nov 30 six of those storms 
have been hurricanes

the womens rights organization khalida 
massaoudi leads is the largest in this moslem nation 400 members 
in a total population of 26 million 
ms massaoudi 32 worries that the shift to democracy will do 
nothing to end tyranny for algerian women her fears deepen with 
each political advance by the fundamentalist islamic salvation 
front known as the fis 
the biggest danger for us is if the fis take power said the 
softspoken teacher of high school mathematics it will prolong 
the totalitarianism algeria has already known too long 
she said the marxist revolutionaries who ruled algeria 
unchallenged for 28 years had given the fundamentalists a 
readymade framework for oppressing women under islamic law 
the national liberation front or fln imposed oneparty rule on 
algeria after winning independence from france in 1962 many fln 
leaders were devout moslems despite their marxist phisosophy and 
wrote into the constitution that algeria would be an islamic 
nation 
ms massaoudi said each member of her independent association 
for the triumph of womens rights is a heroine in a society that 
has never made a gift to women 
for the crushing majority of women in this country the only 
world is the family she said 
although barely 5 feet tall ms massaoudi stands out in her 
workingclass neighborhood she holds a job lives alone leaves 
her red hair uncovered and asks no mans permission to go out 
algerias work force of 8 million includes only 380000 women 
most of the rights leaders female neighbors cover themselves 
with long robes and scarves before leaving their houses and nearly 
always are accompanied by another woman or a male relative 
women served in the national liberation front during the 
eightyear guerrilla war and islamic tradition coexisted uneasily 
with western concepts of womens rights during the first generation 
of independence 
women in algiers and oran wore skirts and trousers but most 
rural women concealed themselves behind veils 
divided as it was between devout moslems from rural areas and 
more secular leaders from the cities the fln sidestepped the issue 
of womens rights 
then in 1984 the national assembly passed the family law in 
response to pressure from islamic fundamentalists it was reformist 
in theory restricting polygamy giving women a say in educating 
their sons after age 10 and allowing women to initiate divorce 
proceedings 
in practice according to ms massaoudi law codified 
secondclass status for women 
one of its victims was a woman who would identify herself only 
as keltoum 
her husband declared them divorced in january and threw keltoum 
31 and their five children out of the house 
he didnt need a court ruling under islamic tradition 
guaranteed by the family law keltoums husband divorced her simply 
by telling her the marriage was over 
had keltoum sought a divorce she would have had to prove in 
court that he had committed adultery or had not wanted children 
i cant imagine saying such things before a judge she said 
no algerian woman could 
an electoral code passed in 1986 allows husbands to cast their 
wives votes which contributed to the sweeping municipal and 
regional election victory by fundamentalists in june 
that law was the final stab in the back by the fln ms 
massaoudi said the fln dug the grave for women and put them in 
it 
the fln has a womens wing as do other parties but they remain 
under the control of male hierarchies 
president chadli bendjedid has proposed reforming the election 
law but the fundamentalist islamic salvation front accuses him of 
bending the rules to help the fln 
with solid support among algerias swollen ranks of unemployed 
young men the fundamentalists have the strongest party as the 
spring parliamentary elections approach 
most followers of the fundamentalist party favor separate 
education for males and females 
the woman is sacred said dilinjer boualem 55 we want 
them to learn to do medicine as the islamic law says but 
mixing this we are against it is forbidden for moslem people 
on rights to work they are more vague an article in the 
salvation fronts newspapr said women should work when necessity 
arises 
the woman who goes to work and preserves her honor modesty 
and purity who honorably fulfills her task then comes home as 
clean as she left should not in our humble opinion be 
considered as having disobeyed the commandments of god it said 
one test of modesty is whether a woman wears the hijab a scarf 
covering the head and neck increasing numbers of women even in 
algiers are doing so because of religious conviction social 
pressure or reasons of fashion 
others refuse even those who will not speak to a western 
journalist without permission from a male relative 
rhodia belkacem a 21yearold secretary who binds her long 
black hair with gold combs said i could never go out in a 
hijab nobodys threatened me but ill never wear it even if they 
kill me

city officials fear an auto parts store 
might want to dismantle a prime example of the original mcdonalds 
restaurant chain and are pushing for monument status for the 
classic golden arches 
this is our most renowned landmark said mayor roy paul i 
believe that it has historical significance and dont want to see 
it destroyed 
the restaurant in question was franchised in 1953 by the 
mcdonald brothers themselves 
city officials fear the pep boys auto parts chain the 
restaurants landlord will decline to renew the lease and tear 
down this fastfood relic that many say brings back memories 
sweeter than a strawberry shake 
the restaurant one of about a dozen franchised in the early 
1950s by dick and mac yes mac mcdonald has two giant arches and 
a 40foot sign featuring speedy the cook ronalds predecessor 
winking in neon 
this city 10 miles southeast of los angeles has long had a soft 
spot for the mcdonalds the restaurant was even exempted from a 
sign ordinance 
the city council also is considering a new historic buildings 
ordinance that would require pep boys to state their case at a 
hearing if they want to evict ronald and company action on the 
ordinance was tabled during this weeks council meeting a new 
debate date was not set 
the savethemcdonalds campaign is among the latest efforts in 
southern california to preserve its fabulous 50s architecture 
studio city residents last year fought to keep a car wash and 
diner from becoming a minimall but the effort came up short and 
the car wash with its distinct 55foot tower shaped like three 
boomerangs and the nearby diner are history 
in downey the mcdonalds has the support of not only the city 
but the giant oak brook illbased mcdonalds corp with 11000 
affiliate and franchise restaurants and 173 billion in 1989 
sales 
the mcdonalds corp which recently bought the downey store 
from its independent operators would like to spend 500000 on a 
renovation project that will improve the stores facilities but 
keep its nostalgic look 
but mcdonalds doesnt want to lay out that kind of cash unless 
pep boys agrees to a longterm lease said william marble regional 
vice president 
we want to restart and bring it up to proud standards said 
marble but if i cant get a longer lease i have to walk away 
pep boys with 300 stores and 900 million in sales wont say 
what it will do with the lease for the restaurant which sits near 
a pep boys store company officials dismissed suggestions they only 
want mcdonalds out of their lives 
we have no intention to knock that thing down and in fact 
right now are trying to negotiate a new lease said fred 
stampone senior vice president of administration 
city officials say they suspect pep boys just wants to keep its 
options open 
they dont want to have a situation where the city requires 
that they keep a hamburger stand there said assistant city 
manager ken farfsing its on a fairly busy corner and they may 
want the ability of getting someone who will pay a higher rent

a sparrowsize creature of 135 million years ago 
appears to be the oldest known bird that lived in trees and flew 
with agility a researcher says 
the creatures feet showed that it lived in trees while its 
wing bones breastbone and short clump of tail bones suggest an 
ability for longrange agile flight said paul sereno who analyzed 
a fossil specimen of the bird 
the bird not yet officially named followed a primitive bird 
called archaeopteryx by about 10 million years 
archaeopteryx which retained many dinosaur characteristics was 
basically a grounddwelling bird that probably could climb trees 
jump and flap its wings to propel itself sereno said but its 
flight may have been rather shortrange he said 
the new study provides a really exciting picture of a 
transitional stage in the early stages of bird history sereno 
said 
the findings challenge assertions by some scientists that birds 
essentially lived on the ground for 50 million to 100 million years 
after archaeopteryx he said 
that idea was questioned two years ago with the report of a 
treedwelling bird from spain that lived 125 million years ago and 
now the new report pushes treedwelling back 10 million years more 
sereno said 
sereno of the university of chicago was to present a 
reconstruction of the fossil bird today at the annual meeting of 
the society of vertebrate paleontology in lawrence kan 
the specimen was found in 1987 in northeastern china the 
beijing natural history museum which owns the fossil asked sereno 
for help in studying it 
john ostrom curator of vertebrate paleontology at the yale 
peabody museum of nature history said serenos interpretation of 
the fossil appears reasonable 
i would be a little bit hesitant to say that the specimen 
demonstrates a treedwelling existence but thats not outrageous 
its reasonable on the basis of what he sees in the specimen he 
said 
ostrom said he has seen the reconstruction but not the specimen 
itself it was very definitely an advancedlevel bird for that 
period showing that modernday flying ability came about very 
early in the history of birds he said 
sereno said the bird long extinct retained some dinosaur 
characteristics movable fingers on the front edge of its wings a 
lack of fusion of many of its bones and a clubshaped end of the 
pubic bone that may have rested on the ground when the bird sat 
sereno said he suspects the bird had teeth but none has been 
firmly identified judging from its size the bird probably ate 
insects probably catching them while it was flying he said 
it is not clear whether its appearance so soon after the more 
primitive archaeopteryx means that modern bird characteristics 
evolved quickly or that archaeopteryx was hanging onto its more 
primitive form while other birds not yet discovered evolved more 
modern characteristics sereno said

elected officials trying to get in step with 
discontented voters are joining the drive to limit politicians 
terms in office 
at least five candidates for governor this year are backing term 
limits in an effort to tap voter resentment of politicians 
and president bush under pressure from his party to join the 
boomlet says hes not opposed to the idea and might sign up too 
i havent decided exactly bush said this week but i 
think people want a change against the incumbents up there on the 
capitol hill 
voters in oklahoma endorsed a ballot referendum last month 
setting a 12year limit on terms for state house and senate 
members the first real victory in this antiestablishment drive 
polls and some primary election results suggest voters are angry 
at politicians in general even if theyre content to reelect 
their own particular legislators and congressmen 
backing term limits is the most accessible device now 
available to try to establish youre antiestablishment said 
thomas e mann director of governmental studies at the brookings 
institution a liberal washington think tank 
thats why political candidates are jumping on the bandwagon 
with it mann said its gotten a lot of attention it seems to 
be antilegislature antigovernment so it seems to be in tune 
with public sentiment 
similar referendums are on the ballot this year in colorado and 
in california no doubt more are coming 
colorados proposal would apply to members of congress as well 
as to state offices although its uncertain whether that would be 
constitutional 
most of the incumbents or candidates backing the idea are 
republicans 
thats no surprise since they tend to be the legislative 
outsiders hoping to become insiders many of the proponents are 
challenging entrenched democratic incumbents 
in fact the drive has been pushed in large part by eddie mahe 
a republican campaign consultant in washington the group americans 
to limit congressional terms operates out of his office 
the republican party platform has called for limits on terms 
since 1984 though hardly anyone pays any attention to party 
platforms 
but the idea has some supporters among democrats too in 
massachusetts both nominees for governor have backed versions of 
the idea 
john silber who upset the party establishment to win the 
democratic nomination wants to limit legislators to six years and 
the governor to eight 
republican rival william weld trying to show hes an outsider 
as well despite his boston brahmin upbringing supports eightyear 
limits for legislators 
among others backing term limits are california sen pete 
wilson the gop nominee for governor kansas gov mike hayden a 
republican whos in a tough reelection fight and florida gov bob 
martinez another republican facing a stiff reelection challenge 
wilsons opponent democrat dianne feinstein countered that 
limits would change little theres no limit on longevity for 
lobbyists or bureaucrats she said 
the rush to embrace the idea leaves some open to charges of 
hypocrisy or at least opportunism 
wilson critics note has held political office of one sort or 
another steadily since 1967 though no one office for more than 12 
years 
and depending on how its implemented such limits may or may 
not have much effect the oklahoma version would allow a state 
house member to serve 12 years in that chamber then 12 more in the 
senate 
still opponents say limits would needlessly purge government 
of experienced and capable politicians 
eightyear limits have been in effect for presidents since harry 
truman however and many states apply limits to governors 
legislators who make the laws havent been inclined to set limits 
on themselves 
but the ballot initiative approach may change that 
i have no doubt that it will spread like contagion now said 
mann its likely to pass in both california and colorado 
and other states will follow he said 
comedian jay leno provided his commentary on nbctvs 
tonight show citing vice president dan quayles support for 
it 
hes been campaigning for shorter terms for politicians 
leno said boy if theres anybody who can convince people thats 
a good idea its dan quayle

gianfranco ferre and karl lagerfeld have 
crossed the formidable frenchitalian fashion frontier keeping a 
foot on each runway 
the result is exhausting for the designers and a mixed bag of 
the best and the notsogreat of both worlds for the consumer 
ferre creates his own label out of milan and in paris designs 
readytowear and couture for christian dior one of the capitals 
oldest and most respected fashion houses 
parisbased lagerfeld covers a big chunk of french fashion 
designing for himself and for chanel diors traditional rival in 
italy he is the creative genius behind fendis readytowear 
collections and its luxurious furs 
tuesday evening their shows were backtoback on the milan 
runway where the italian springsummer 1991 readytowear 
collections are being presented this week 
lagerfeld has few problems adapting french coquetry to the 
sensible lines of tailored italian fashion ferre on the other 
hand seems to be struggling to reconcile the purity of his 
sculpted fashion with the more daring parisian look 
beautiful ferre signature blouses in crisp organza with wide 
collar and turned up french cuff find themselves paired with slick 
patent leather hot pants welltailored leather trousers are 
toughened by combat belts and goggle glasses reminiscent of the 
more aggressive parisian leather look 
big bows are a ferre specialty but this season he decorates 
them with jewel encrusted floral bouquets taken seperately they 
are lovely adornments but together they are excessive 
when ferre stuck to his milanese guns the collection was 
stunning as in the white and ivory striped pant suits the white 
crochet shift dresses the chocolate brown leather perforated 
pants or the floor length gowns with cut out embroidery 
true to the latest trend in milanese fashion ferre presented a 
series of colorful prints which reached their fashion peak in rich 
jewel encrusted evening jackets 
the main reason why lagerfeld finds it so easy to spice italian 
designs with french frivolity is that he is designing for the 
inventive roman fendi sisters 
for the springsummer 1991 lagerfeld prints zodiac signs on 
tshirts catsuits and swim apparel 
the central item of the collection is the blouse loose and 
often pleated at the back 
true to the latest trends the fendi collection is full of 
pretty dresses in linen and silk more often than not in demure 
navy blue perfect for a gigi revival 
if lagerfeld followed some directions of the milanese pack the 
bathing line was all his and all french 
based on the corset in shiny stretch fabric lagerfeld paraded 
30 versions down the runway all accessoried by thigh stockings and 
high heels for those slow to get the folies bergere point

if president bush cant make up his mind on 
taxes the 535 members of congress many of them up for 
reelection this fall may have an even harder time 
after leading the charge for the past four months on a 500 
billion fiveyear deficitreduction package the white house left 
the playing field wednesday 
let congress clear it up bush shrugged as he campaigned in 
the south for republican candidates 
his comment coming a day after his apparent flipflop on 
whether to seek a compromise containing higher tax rates for 
affluent americans only sowed more confusion in an already 
convoluted budget situation 
democratic leaders seized on the opportunity to portray the 
president as indecisive progress on a budget agreement once again 
appeared to be grinding to a halt because of the white houses 
mixed signals 
should lawmakers heed bushs statement made at a white house 
news conference tuesday morning that he would accept higher taxes 
on the wealthiest americans at some level in exchange for a 
lower capital gains tax rate 
or should they believe republicans including sen bob packwood 
rore who say bush later buckled under pressure from gop senators 
and withdrew his support for such a deal 
or should they believe wednesdays claim by senate republican 
leader bob dole rkan suggesting bush had not ruled out a tax 
increase 
bush and his aides did little to clarify the matter or to hint 
where his spinning compass might point when it finally comes to a 
rest 
the president deflected questions with wisecracks 
he was asked as he jogged during a break in st petersburg 
fla if he would care to clear up the confusion confusion he 
responded 
was he giving up on a lower capital gains tax 
read my hips he said as he jogged by pointing at his 
buttocks 
bushs chief spokesman marlin fitzwater was equally cryptic 
i want to bob and weave on this today because we want congress 
to come up with a package and we dont want to signal on any 
particular position fitzwater said 
fitzwater also appeared to dispute packwoods characterization 
that bush agreed tuesday to drop the issue of higher taxes on the 
wealthy and a cut in capital gains rates he said the president 
listened but did not voice an opinion 
however accounts by other administration officials tended to 
back up packwoods description of the meeting 
and a senior administration official aboard air force one with 
the president wednesday night said bush still is open on the 
tax issue despite suggestions to the contrary the president just 
doesnt want to go any further out on a limb and invite more pot 
shots from democrats the official said 
he took water by saying revenues higher taxes he had a 
package and he lost now he figures its up to congress the 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity why should he 
show his behind before others 
bush dropped his 1988 no new taxes campaign pledge early in 
the search for a budget compromise a move that deeply divided 
republicans in congress 
over the past months that statement came to be interpreted as 
meaning that bush would consider certain kinds of new taxes like 
excise taxes but not higher income tax rates 
the budget package put together by the white house and 
congressional leaders and rejected last week by the house did 
propose higher taxes on gasoline cigarettes alcohol and certain 
luxury items but not on income 
thus when bush declared tuesday that he might consider raising 
the tax bracket for the wealthiest americans now 28 percent it 
sent new shudders through the alreadybattered gop minorities in 
the house and the senate 
it also raised red flags with conservative white house staffers 
including chief of staff john sununu sources said 
increasing the tax rate on the wealthy to 33 percent as 
proposed by some democratic leaders would represent a significant 
boost it could far overshadow the benefit from the capital gains 
tax cut that would be the other part of such a deal 
thus bush likely would be giving up more than he got in 
agreeing to such a swap a point sources said was driven home to 
him at tuesdays meeting

white house chief of staff john sununus 
reputation as big bad john on capitol hill comes as no 
surprise to former associates in new hampshire who say his 
persistence as governor sometimes turned into belligerence 
but even some bruised in the legislative giveandtake during 
his six years as the states chief executive admire his ability to 
get things done 
theyre so used to being treated with such deference in 
washington house democratic leader mary chambers said wednesday 
they go home and everybody bows and scrapes and wants to shake 
their hand they get pretty arrogant and selfsatisfied 
someone like john sununu comes along and doesnt care who they 
are the mission of getting the job done thats his driving thing 
it amuses me to read what they say about him 
sununu bullied some yelled at others he tried logic humor 
some recall telephone calls every 15 minutes with additional points 
he wanted to make to win their support 
if i had to use one word to describe his tactics it would be 
effective said senate republican leader edward dupont he 
was capable of doing whatever he needed to get the job done 
dupont said no one who ever worked with sununu would see him 
as a kind and gentle man but neither could they call him 
meanspirited 
i cant classify him as a bully because whenever he pushed it 
wasnt for the satisfaction of bullying someone but to get 
something done dupont said 
chambers differed often with sununu over issues particularly 
sununus steadfast support for licensing of the seabrook nuclear 
plant but she said he has the ability to get in and stir things 
up to end legislative deadlocks 
joan dolloff president of the state employees association also 
butted heads with sununu who was george bushs campaign manager in 
1988 
when that man took over all i heard was about his arrogance 
but i and my issues were treated with respect she said 
half of those postures he makes as a stand if someone had the 
fortitude to come back at him hed sit down with them she said 
if people can be turned away by what they perceive as john 
sununus arrogant attitude they have no business playing the 
game 
dolloff recalls an angry phone call from sununu during george 
bushs campaign when the unions executive director accused sununu 
of grandstanding over a childcare program 
i said yes he did say that and i concur with him 
dolloff said there was a flurry of negative language i held the 
phone out he said consider yourself out of the loop well i 
didnt know i was in the loop 
sununu continued to return her calls as if the conversation had 
never taken place she said 
former state gop chairwoman donna sytek a state representative 
from sununus hometown of salem clashed with him over party 
policy 
sununu told her he didnt think an elected official should be 
party head then backed another state representative for the post 
i knew i could win but it would be a hollow victory so i didnt 
run she said 
yet sytek said shed support him for governor again in an 
instant our philosophies are so compatible she said 
legislators and associates who worked with sununu developed a 
respect for his handson knowledge of government particularly the 
state budget 
he always took everything from the minute detail and worked up 
from that dupont said that lent credibility to solutions he 
proposed he said 
sytek said theres no question sununu bullied to get through 
his program a program very thoughtout and driven by ideology 
but she said it wasnt so much to build up power for himself 
or the office but to make government function 
he also was charming at a dinner not long before he went to 
washington he left the stage to greet chambers in the audience 
chambers asked if shed get into see him if she came to washington 
he said the minute you arrive ill be sure the tall skinny 
man gets out of my office and see you chambers said i said 
john youve got it backwards

despite their 70hour work weeks late nights and 
grinding stress doctors who become pregnant during residency 
training face a low risk of giving birth prematurely a study today 
shows 
the study casts doubt on the widely held belief that women who 
work in demanding stressful jobs are more likely to deliver too 
early 
the researchers based their conclusions on a sample of young 
doctors in training at hospitals across the united states they 
noted that it would be hard to find a group of women who worked 
longer hours got by on less sleep or were under more stress 
they surveyed 4412 women doctors and compared their pregnancies 
to those among 4236 wives of male residents they found that 989 
of the women doctors gave birth to a single child during residency 
1238 of the residents wives gave birth to a single child 
although the women residents worked about twice as many hours as 
the wives about 6 percent of both groups delivered prematurely an 
unusually low rate the risk of having especially small babies was 
also about the same for both groups 
only when women worked more than 100 hours a week did they seem 
to raise their risk of premature delivery 
the work by dr mark a klebanoff of the national institute of 
child health and human development was published in the new 
england journal of medicine 
earlier research has found that pregnant women who work nights 
put in long hours or stand a lot are more likely to have premature 
deliveries the latest report suggests that these difficult 
pregnancies result because such women are often poor not because 
of their work 
during the first three months of pregnancy the doctors worked 
an average of 74 hours a week while the wives worked 38 by the 
third trimester the doctors were working 64 hours and the wives 35 
hours 
half the residents worked until the day of delivery compared 
with onequarter of the wives 
these results call into question the association between 
stressful occupations requiring long hours of physical activity and 
the incidence of preterm delivery the researchers wrote 
however they said their research suggests that new rules in new 
york state that limit medical residents to 80hour work weeks are a 
good idea

congressional negotiators are edging closer to 
agreement on a clean air bill with a compromise on auto emission 
controls an issue that stalled the talks for several weeks 
the tentative accord reached wednesday on emissions removed a 
major obstacle to working out legislation that can be sent to the 
white house before congress adjourns later this month 
its a major breakthrough said sen max baucus dmont 
head of the senate negotiating team 
the legislation which represents the first tightening of air 
pollution laws since 1977 also would impose new requirements on 
utilities factories and thousands of small businesses to reduce 
urban smog toxic chemical releases and pollution that causes acid 
rain 
the new requirements are expected to cost the economy from 21 
billion to 25 billion a year when all the provisions take effect 
toward the end of the decade according to white house estimates 
members of the house and senate negotiating teams said they 
hoped to complete work on the section on toxic industrial pollution 
within the next day or two and turn to the section on acid rain 
this weekend congressional leaders have set a goal of completing 
the bill by midnight sunday 
baucus said he hoped the final wording of the completed 
legislation might be approved monday by the house and senate 
conferees who have met since july 13 to combine clean air bills 
passed by the two chambers 
the motor vehicle compromise reached after sometimes 
aroundtheclock staff negotiations calls for 30 percent to 60 
percent cuts in various smogcausing tailpipe emissions it also 
provides for a limited phasein of alternativefuel cars mostly 
for fleet use and cleaner burning fuels in cities with the worst 
smog problems 
in some cases the compromise was weaker than proposals passed 
by either the house or senate earlier this year because 
implementation of many of the tougher standards were postponed by 
several years the white house argued for some of the delays 
claiming for example that a requirement for cleaner fuels could 
lead to supply shortages almost immediately 
in the compromise the requirement for cleaner gasoline blends 
in cities with the worst smog would not go into effect until 1995 
instead of next year some of the fleet provisions requiring the 
use of vehicles that run on a fuel other than gasoline also would 
be moved back from the mid1990s to 1998 
its a very ambitious program but a program that is not going 
to have much of an impact until the late 1990s or early in the 21st 
century said daniel weiss who has followed the clean air debate 
for the sierra club an environmental organization 
a dispute over state enforcement of auto pollution requirements 
which had occupied the negotiations for more than a week was 
resolved by allowing states to enforce their own standards as long 
as they arent tougher than rules set by california or the federal 
government 
senators from some states including new york had balked at an 
earlier proposal they said would have kept states from enforcing 
tougher auto emission controls such as the california standards 
rep john dingell dmich who heads the house negotiators had 
insisted on a provision that would safeguard automakers from having 
to meet myriad pollution requirements in various states 
by resolving the motor vehicle section of the bill the house 
and senate negotiators resolved the toughest obstacle to final 
passage of the legislation baucus said late wednesday he said 
he now was increasingly optimistic that a final bill could be 
approved this session 
dingell was less enthusiastic saying only that the conferees 
are well over halfway toward the goal of getting a bill 
enacted this year 
the conferees reached agreement earlier on three other sections 
of the bill new pollution controls on factories and businesses to 
reduce urban smog a phaseout of chemicals that cause a depletion 
of the atmospheric ozone layer and rules on timetables for cities 
to meet federal air quality standards

coffee drinkers delight a good cup of joe or 
two or three wont hurt the heart harvard researchers reported 
today 
in fact coffee with caffeine the often maligned chemical that 
gives the brew its kick may turn out to be easier on the heart 
than the decaffeinated variety 
its amazing how coffee has a bad name when the harder one 
looks at health hazards the more difficult it is to find adverse 
effects says dr walter willett of the harvard school of public 
health 
his research part of a huge study of healthy people shows that 
those who drink several cups of ordinary caffeinated coffee every 
day do not raise their risk of heart attacks 
this is a very reassuring study for something that people 
enjoy day in and day out said dr harvey wolinsky of mt sinai 
hospital in new york an adviser to the national coffee 
association 
the research was based on a survey of the coffeedrinking habits 
o 45589 men it was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
those who suspected coffee was bad for the heart usually assumed 
caffeine was to blame but the new research suggests just the 
opposite those who drink more than four cups of decaf a day have 
about a 60 percent higher risk of heart disease than do those who 
never drink it 
the researchers cautioned that the link between decaf and heart 
trouble is statistically weak and its too soon to conclude decaf 
is harmful 
there is no particular reason to switch from caffeinated to 
decaffeinated coffee from the point of view of preventing heart 
disease he said 
another recent study also raised doubts about decaffeinated 
coffee researchers at stanford university found that people who 
switch from regular coffee to decaf increased their levels of 
lowdensity lipoprotein the socalled bad cholesterol an 
average of 7 percent 
no one knows why decaffeinated coffee might do this some 
speculate it could result from differences in the type of beans 
used to make decaf or in the way they are processed 
caffeine might trigger heart palpitations in some people but 
dr peter wilson of the framingham heart study said there is no 
good proof of this either 
the marcus welby theories are reasonable but there isnt a 
lot of proof to back them up that you should be drinking decaf 
because its better for your heart wilson said robert young 
who played dr welby in a tv series made commercials for a brand 
of decaffeinated coffee 
wilson added that if people believe they have fewer palpitations 
by switching its very reasonable and they shouldnt toss the 
decaf down the sink 
while the wisdom of very high coffee consumption is 
questionable several experts agreed that three or four cups a day 
of typical american coffee are safe for virtually everybody even 
those with heart disease 
participants in the harvard study all doctors dentists and 
other health professionals filled out questionnaires about their 
coffee habits after two years 221 of them had suffered heart 
attacks or died of heart disease while 136 had undergone coronary 
bypass surgery or angioplasty 
the risk among those who drank four or more cups of all kinds of 
coffee or just caffeinated coffee was about the same as for 
nonusers 
this study means that if there is a hazard with drinking 
caffeinated coffee its going to be very small and there may be 
none at all said willett

more than 33000 military reservists have been 
called to active duty in support of the us buildup in the persian 
gulf area nearly as many as were activated during crises in 
vietnam and korea in 1968 
the army today activated 12 national guard and 24 army reserve 
units from 24 states and puerto rico for a total of 4846 troops 
meanwhile the marine corps said wednesday it was calling up about 
160 reservists 
those actions brought to 33252 the number of reservists from 
all services activated since aug 22 when president bush authorized 
their use in support of operation desert shield 
none of the reserves called so far are from combat units all 
are performing combat support or combat service functions such as 
cargo handling air sea and ground transportation water 
purification intelligence and security 
the 160 marine reservists are the first from that service branch 
to get the call in the current crisis 
the pentagon said in late august that it expected to call up 
nearly 50000 reserves by oct 1 but officials recently said the 
immediate need had been overestimated 
still the total ordered to active duty so far is approaching 
the 35280 called up in 1968 following the tet offensive in vietnam 
and the seizure by north korea of the us surveillance ship 
pueblo those were the most recent uses of military reserves other 
than a brief callup during the 1970 postal workers strike 
the marine reservists called up wednesday are forming a combat 
service support detachment to replace active duty marines at 
kaneohe bay hawaii who already have been sent to the gulf area

chances seem dim that legislation authorizing 
a referendum on the status of puerto rico will pass congress this 
year despite approval of the bill by the house and the support of 
president bush 
sen bennett johnston dla who is handling the senate version 
of the bill said wednesday that time has run out 
with probably only 10 days remaining in this congress and 
absent a lameduck session it has become clear that enactment of a 
puerto rico referendum bill is not possible said johnston there 
are substantial differences between the house and senate 
approaches to this issue differences which cannot be resolved 
within the very limited amount of time remaining in this 
congress he said 
the house by voice vote approved a bill wednesday that 
authorizes 135 million for a referendum to determine whether 
puerto rico should become a state become independent or have 
enhanced commonwealth status 
in order for the money to be spent however an appropriations 
measure also would have to be approved 
the bill has the potential to open up a path that in time will 
bring to an indisputable end the united states imputed 
colonialistic rule of puerto rico said jaime fuster the 
islands nonvoting resident commissioner in congress 
delegate ron de lugo dvi who sponsored the bill said it 
would establish the necessary process at a time when 
selfdetermination is spreading through the world 
bush in a letter to de lugo said i would urge the entire 
congress to act affirmatively and rapidly on whatever responsible 
measure comes before them to call for a referendum on puerto ricos 
political status i stand ready to sign such legislation when it 
reaches my desk 
rep jose serrano dny who was born in puerto rico said he 
hoped johnston could be persuaded to change his mind and move 
forward during the remaining days of the session 
i very much fear that to lose our momentum now could end 
prospects of a puerto rican referendum for years said serrano 
johnston said he would meet with puerto rican leaders next month 
to consider steps to be taken in the next session of congress 
if there is a determination to continue this effort then i 
expect to resume consideration of the senate legislation where we 
have left off and complete senate action early next year which 
would still allow for a referendum in 1991 or early 1992 well 
before the scheduled fall 1992 local elections he said 
the house bill calls for the referendum to be held sept 16 
1991 or later if agreed to by a majority of puerto ricos three 
political parties the three parties represent the three choices of 
status that would be on the ballot 
once the referendum is held congress would be required to enact 
further legislation to implement the decision of the referendum to 
be ratified by puerto ricans in a second round of balloting 
under the senate bill the referendum would automatically change 
puerto ricos political status it has been approved by two 
committees but still needs action by a third before going to the 
full senate for a vote 
there was no dissent in the house during debate on the 
referendum bill 
status has been an obsession in puerto rico since it was ruled 
by spain after more than 400 years as a colony the island won 
autonomy and full representation in the spanish parliament in 1897 
the next year it lost all selfdetermination when the united 
states took possession through the treaty of paris in 1917 puerto 
ricans were made us citizens 
the island is a commonwealth of the united states but that 
status does not bestow upon puerto ricans all the privileges of 
other americans for example they do not get the same welfare 
benefits as residents of the states and the district of columbia 
they also do not have full voting representation in congress 
neither do they pay federal income tax

congress is considering a boost in benefits 
for the military reserves activated in the persian gulf buildup 
i believe that all of our military personnel in the persian 
gulf deserve a tangible expression of our support said sen john 
glenn dohio 
house and senate versions of the 1991 defense bill would provide 
an immediate housing allowance for reservists called to active duty 
to support operation desert shield a total of 33252 as of 
wednesday 
generally once members of the national guard or reserves are 
called to active duty for more than 30 days they receive the same 
pay and benefits as their active duty counterparts salary is based 
on the active duty pay scale for grade and length of service 
all of the reservists called up by president bush are on an 
initial 90day assignment 
the dependents of such a reservist are also entitled to 
medical care commissary exchange and other morale welfare and 
recreation benefits on the same basis as the dependents of any 
other active duty member said the congressional research service 
in a briefing paper 
the two major exceptions to the benefits for reserves are dental 
care and housing 
military personnel must serve at least two years of active duty 
service for dependents to receive nonemergency dental care and 
the house and senate bills do not change that policy 
the variable housing allowance based on local housing costs and 
paid to personnel who do not live in government housing requires a 
call to active duty of at least 140 days 
in senate legislation reservists called to active duty would be 
exempted from the 140day requirement to qualify for the housing 
allowance the bill also would exempt reservists from limits on 
payment of unused leave 
glenn and sen john mccain rariz members of the senate armed 
services committee are seeking to add those benefits for 
reservists called to active duty along with income tax relief and 
a savings program for all military personnel to the defense bill 
for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the house defense bill makes a similar change in the housing 
allowance requirement it also would allow reserve medical and 
dental officers to receive the same pay as their active duty 
counterparts 
in both the house and senate legislation lawmakers called for 
providing imminent danger pay of 110 a month to all service 
personnel in the persian gulf region 
defense secretary dick cheney already has acted on that matter 
though approving the imminent danger pay on sept 20 retroactive 
to sept 1

safety watchdogs frustrated by alleged 
bureaucratic footdragging are calling for action on 18 most 
wanted improvements in air sea and land transportation 
but transportation department officials say progress is being 
made on many of the issues raised by the national transportation 
safety board and that some recommendations either have been 
implemented or soon will be 
the proposals by the ntsb an independent federal agency range 
from development of an effective air collisionavoidance system to 
adoption of state laws permitting police to confiscate licenses on 
the spot from suspected drunken drivers 
they address safety conditions on fishing vssels and giant 
passenger liners seek new systems to keep railroad trains from 
colliding into each other call for the identification of pilots 
with drug and alcohol problems and seek to identify links between 
fatigue and transportation accidents 
safety recommendations also are made for school buses heavy 
commercial trucks and passenger cars 
each of the 18 recommendations stemmed from the ntsbs 
investigation of an actual accident many of them involving 
multiple deaths 
the boards mostwanted list seeks to speed action by regulatory 
agencies industry and state and local governments 
its a call to action said ntsb chairman james l kolstad 
our mostwanted list of recommendations represents some of the 
biggest areas for lifesaving 
i think on some issues there has been footdragging he 
said noting that federal rulemaking procedures can delay 
implementation for five years or more 
the safety board has no actual enforcement power it can only 
identify possible safety improvements and recommend they be 
implemented 
ed ohara a transportation department spokesman said that is 
being done in many cases 
on the screening of commercial pilots for drug and alcohol 
abuse ohara said i believe we are doing essentially what this 
recommendation is proposing 
the federal aviation administration adopted a new regulation in 
july to identify and ground pilots involved in alcohol or 
drugrelated motor vehicle offenses that result in convictions or 
administrative offenses faa spokesman bob buckhorn noted 
after nov 29 he said pilots must notify the faa within 60 
days of such actions and face revocation of their medical 
certificates which you need to fly if they fail to do so 
kolstad said he believes the highestpriority item on the list 
is the recommendation for the passage of laws in all states to 
permit police officers to seize licenses of drivers who fail or 
refuse to take alcohol tests 
that is the single most important way to get drunk drivers off 
the road he said 
air accidents can be reduced the safety board said by 
requiring an airborne collision avoidance system a recommendation 
first made in 1969 and by installing systems to avoid collisions 
on the ground 
the ntsbs other mostwanted safety improvements include 
legislation to allow alcohol testing if an operator of a 
recreational boat is suspected of being intoxicated 
a requirement that commuter aircraft to carry ground proximity 
warning devices 
sweeping improvements in fishing vessel safety including 
legislative authority to require the licensing of captains and the 
installation of basic lifesaving gear 
adjustable seat belts in new cars to make them suitable and 
safe for children 
new standards to incorporate materials in new school buses that 
will slow the spread of fire 
improved fire safety standards on passenger vessels including 
automatic devices to close doors when smoke detectors are 
activated 
uniform regulations for drug and alcohol testing of all 
transportation employees responsible for operations and safety 
safety improvements in commercial trucking by detecting and 
preventing drug and alcohol abuse imposing medical standards and 
dealing with driver fatigue 
the safety board has made 8200 accidentprevention 
recommendations since it was founded in 1968 kolstad said 81 
percent have been adopted but 1800 including some of the most 
troublesome safety issues before the board have not

nine former kennedy administration officials 
are disputing the governments refusal to release about 700 
documents from the cuban missile crisis 
in papers filed in us district court the exofficials said 
the government has failed to justify keeping information on the 
1962 crisis secret the withheld material includes memos written by 
the nine officials themselves 
they include kennedy administration under secretary of state 
george ball treasury secretary c douglas dillon and theodore 
sorensen special counsel to the president all three served on the 
national security councils executive committee which dealt with 
the crisis 
philip brenner a professor at american university is suing the 
state department in an effort to get the documents on the 
superpower confrontation 
the soviet installation of missiles in cuba pushed the united 
states and the soviet union to the brink of nuclear war the 
soviets eventually agreed to remove the missiles 
the state department is invoking national security concerns in 
refusing to release the documents the agency provided 
insufficient information about many of the documents ball said 
in a court affidavit 
an affidavit by sorensen noted that it is 28 years after the 
events in question and neither the principal figures or 
principal issues of that crisis are still with us 
the state department fails to provide sufficient information 
regarding withheld documents and the reasons for their 
nondisclosure sorensen added 
brenners attorneys the law firm of crowell amp moring got the 
affidavits as part of brenners motion demanding a detailed state 
department explanation of the documents the case is before us 
district judge norma holloway johnson 
the affidavits highlight the state departments inconsistent and 
improper over classification of documents said the national 
security archive a nonprofit group that is doing legal work in the 
case 
the withheld material concerns communications between the united 
states and the soviet union and cable and letter exchanges between 
president kennedy and soviet leader nikita khrushchev 
it also relates to meetings of highranking kennedy 
administration officials and anticipated covert actions in cuba and 
communications from us embassies thousands of other documents on 
the crisis already have been released 
under the freedom of information act the government in most 
cases must identify the documents it is withholding and detail the 
reason 
but the government has failed to do this say the former kennedy 
administration officials 
the state department withheld one document which it described as 
analysis regarding cuba 
there were many documents fitting that description which i 
either authored or received during this time period said edwin 
martin former assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs 
it is impossible from the description to evaluate the decision 
to withhold the document on national security grounds martin said 
in an affidavit 
the other kennedyera officials who filed affidavits in the case 
were u alexis johnson deputy under secretary of state harlan 
cleveland assistant secretary of state roger hilsman director of 
the state departments bureau of intelligence and research leonard 
meeker assistant legal adviser and raymond garthoff adviser to 
the bureau of politicomilitary affairs 
the government also said some of the material is exempt from 
public release because it relates to the deliberative process 
within a federal agency

gov james blanchards tactics have been 
as effective as the third reich under hitler says a supporter of 
republican gubernatorial candidate john engler 
richard headlee the leader of a statewide property tax cut 
effort made the comment at a news conference and englers 
campaign later backed away from it 
i think dick got a little zealous with that said dan pero 
englers campaign director he was talking about the public 
relations machine we dont share dicks view on that dick gets 
somewhat carried away and he used a poor analogy 
claims that blanchard uses state resources to promote himself 
have been a consistent theme of englers campaign but pero said 
the alleged abuses do not compare to hitlers tactics 
headlee the 1982 gop gubernatorial candidate said he was not 
comparing blanchard with hitler he said he was accusing democrat 
blanchard of dispensing misleading information to convince voters 
he supports property tax relief as hitlers machine brainwashed the 
german people to support the nazi programs

that successor is important the democrat feinstein said at

the republican wilson has declined to name his preferred

a 153 billion foreign aid bill that would 
forgive egypts military debt to the united states and sharply 
restrict aid to el salvador has cleared the senate appropriations 
committee 
the action came wednesday on a routine voice vote even though 
president bush has threatened to veto the measure because of its el 
salvador provisions 
the measure is certain to spark a spirited fight when it goes 
before the full senate perhaps as early as friday 
the measure is almost identical to one approved a week ago by 
the panels foreign aid subcommittee the primary exception was the 
addition of 306 million to the bills economic aid accounts to 
conform to congress budget agreement with the white house 
efforts are expected later to strike from the bill the 
forgiveness of 67 billion in past military debts owed by egypt 
bush wants to erase the debt as a reward for egypts leadership in 
marshaling arab action against iraq in the persian gulf crisis 
the committee avoided a fight over the el salvador provisions 
delaying that battle for the full senate as it stands the bill 
would cut the countrys 85 million in military aid in half 
the administration wants the bill to restore all aid unless the 
rebels agree to a ceasefire within 60 days a move opponents say 
would undercut talks going on at the united nations

the government says it got no takers for 
almost a fifth of the nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil offered 
from the strategic petroleum reserve 
the energy department said wednesday it has selected 11 
companies for the purchase of a little less than 4 million barrels 
of oil from the reserve under the test drawdown order given by 
president bush last month 
the department said the amount was short of what had been 
expected to be sold because there were no bids for more than 
800000 barrels of highsulfur sour crude that were offered 
the sour crude was one of six types of oil offered from the reserve 
stocks in salt domes along the texas and louisiana coasts 
buyers will take 135 million barrels of other kinds of sour 
crude some refineries cannot process highsulfur crude because it 
corrodes their equipment 
the lack of interest in the sour crude was attributed to an 
expected increase in the amount of similar oil from alaskas north 
slope at gulf coast ports next month 
successful bids ranged from 3264 to 3906 per barrel the 
department will be able to adjust those prices somewhat to reflect 
changes in the oil market before delivery

hunting cabins vacation cottages and other remote areas are being 
recalled because they have killed at least 14 people in the united 
states by carbon monoxide poisoning in the past decade 
the consumer product safety commission said it has arranged for 
consumers to receive 100 in exchange for the servel refrigerators 
which were manufactured between 1933 and 1957 
the commission said gas burners in the refrigerators can be 
fouled by dust rust or other obstructions and produce deadly 
carbon monoxide especially if the refrigerator has not been used 
for some time 
in addition to their use in recreational cabins the 
refrigerators continue to be used in remote areas where there is no 
electricity or where propane gas is a preferred energy source the 
commission said

a european parliament report says 
racism is on the rise in europe with tens of thousands of bias 
attacks occurring annually in britain alone and most germans 
believing immigrants exploit their charity 
but the 518member assembly only halfheartedly endorsed the 
document on wednesday partly because of a recommendation to give 
immigrants the right to vote in local elections after five years of 
residency 
after some intense political wrangling the parliament agreed to 
simply pass the report which took a year to be completed by a 
special committee of inquiry on to the 12 european community 
governments without comment 
the vote was 181to146 with 18 abstentions 
the 176page report offered a detailed summary of racist 
incidents and the activities of rightwing political groups in 
europe in recent years 
it said racism is worsening in europe largely because of rising 
immigration but it also cites political changes in eastern europe 
that have allowed many longfestering ethnic disputes to break out 
into the open 
among those voting against the report were the parliaments 17 
extreme rightwingers who argued that it overstated racism 
liberals and christian democrats also voted against 
the report was written by a special panel of inquiry it 
followed a similar study in the mid1980s which was found last year 
to have shortcomings for ignoring the effect of the ecs single 
market project on race relations 
among other things the new report says 
one in three citizens of ec countries believe there are too 
many people of other nationalities in their countries 
in the united kingdom a country plagued by an especially 
high level of racial harassment and violence as many as 70000 
racial attacks occur annually in recent years britains neonazi 
skinhead movement has spread to other european nations 
especially germany belgium and the netherlands 
rightwing political parties with pronounced racist views have 
won seats in national parliaments in france germany the 
netherlands and belgium 
almost 70 percent of germans believe immigrants unfairly 
exploit their social welfare system 
france has been gripped recently by a growing number of 
racially motivated killings bombings and vandalism 
in greece moslems are often harassed and denied building 
permits and drivers licences 
in all the report made 77 recommendations aimed at improving 
conditions for the estimated 12 to 14 million immigrants in the 
european community and to encourage racial tolerance 
our aim should be that there be no secondclass citizens 
within the ec after the creation of the single market of 1992 
said glyn ford a british socialist and the author of the report 
among the most farreaching recommendations was one urging the 
ec executive commission to draft a european residents charter 
that would allow nonec nationals legally resident in one ec 
nation the same freedom of movement within the 12nation bloc as 
ec citizens 
the report also urged the european commission to send more money 
to poorer areas with high immigrant populations and to adopt a 
common policy on refugee and visa issues 
the european community comprises britain france the 
netherlands belgium germany spain portugal italy luxembourg 
denmark ireland and greece

a planeload of americans and other foreigners held in kuwait and 
iraq arrived in britain thursday on a flight to freedom in america 
earlier an air force jet crashed in saudi arabia killing both 
crewmen 
about 320 people were on the iraqi airways boeing 747 most of 
them americans left stranded in kuwait by the aug 2 iraqi 
invasion 
it was the first uschartered evacuation flight since sept 
22 diplomats in basra iraq had put the number leaving as about 
400 including about 350 americans 25 britons and some canadians 
and japanese 
an airport official at londons gatwick airport said the plane 
left the iraqi capital baghdad around midnight and arrived thursday 
morning at gatwick airport outside london 
officials in north carolina said the state department told them 
the americans would fly into raleighdurham international airport 
on friday 
the evacuees were taken by bus to basra to begin the air journey 
home 
as in previous evacuation flights arrangements called for 
westerners on board to be limited to women and children and to 
americans of arab ancestry 
the jet crash wednesday was the fourth us military air 
accident since the united states began deploying forces in the 
persian gulf region following iraqs invasion two helicopters also 
disappeared during a training flight in all 24 servicemen have 
died and eight are missing 
meanwhile the 10weekold crisis brought more bad news for the 
us economy oil prices rose to a record 4115 a barrel on the 
new york exchange before closing at 3869 tumbling on an 
erroneous rumor iraqi leader saddam hussein had been killed 
on tuesday oil closed at 4040 
traders said prices were pushed higher in part by the slayings 
of 19 palestinians in a clash with police in jerusalem on monday 
and by saddams threat to retaliate against israel 
on the new york stock exchange the dow jones industrial average 
fell 3762 points to 240792 its lowest since may 1989 
saddam said tuesday that iraq had added another missile to its 
arsenal that could be launched against the targets of evil when 
the day of reckoning comes 
he made it clear he was referring to israel and the usled 
forces sent to saudi arabia after kuwait was captured about 
170000 us forces are deployed in saudi arabia and on warships in 
the gulf region 
saddam has repeatedly tried to link the status of palestinians 
in the israelioccupied territories with kuwait indicating he 
might withdraw from the emirate if israel quits arab lands seized 
in 1967 
in washington families of seven us service personnel in the 
crisis area two congressmen reps jim moody and gerald kleczka 
both wisconsin democrats and religious leaders expressed their 
concern at a news conference about the military deployment in saudi 
arabia 
the families wrote in an open letter to bush the persian gulf 
crisis is not just a constitutional a military or an economic 
crisis it is a family crisis all across the country families are 
facing the possible death of loved ones in a military offensive 
they do not support 
they urged bush to pledge no offensive action and to make the 
us forces part of a truly multinational and purely defensive 
peacekeeping force under un leadership 
alex molnar of milwaukee father of a marine in the gulf area 
said the families want a response from bush and congress 
isnt it time we got an answer our voices must be heard he 
said 
the united states has so far taken no military action in the 
gulf but at least two dozen servicemen have died in training or 
other accidents the pentagon said wednesday 
on wednesday an f111 fighter plane crashed in the southern 
arabian peninsula on a training mission us military spokesman 
lt cmdr jd van sickle said adding that an investigation was 
under way

of harrisburg pa the pilot and capt thomas r caldwell of 
columbus ohio the weapons systems officer

helicopters over the northern arabian sea on monday and was 
suspending the search an air force f4 reconnaissance jet also 
went down monday killing both crew members 
in addition 13 other air force personnel were killed aug 29 in 
a crash of a c5 jet cargo plane in germany the c5 was ferrying

founded 20 years ago in a country more comfortable with sand than 
the sea is trying to recruit enough sailors to field larger ships 
officers say 
the navy hopes to double its recruit from about 3000 per year 
so it can staff frigateclass warships as part of an ambitious 
expansion campaign they say 
as we get bigger ships we find it difficult to man some of 
them fully cmdr faraj algathian one of four squadron leaders

the navy has taken a number of steps to overcome the problem 
including heavy computerization on board ships to pare the number

navy as a career pay incentives and special attention to family 
needs while men are at sea

watching exercises 70 miles off the coast 
the larger ships in the saudi navy up to 10000 tons are 
stationed at naval bases along the western red sea coast 
in all the saudi navy has 7200 men including 1200 marines 
it has eight frigates 13 patrol and combat ships and four 
minesweepers 
its air wing consists of 24 helicopters most frenchmade 
dauphin ii attack craft and super puma transports 
the saudi navy has the capability to defend the coast in this 
region we have good defensive equipment said capt ibrahim 
aqqad flotilla commander and acting commander of the abdul aziz 
naval base in jubail opened 11 years ago 
the saudi navy has not been involved in the interdiction and 
boarding of ships heading to and from iraq but is monitoring 
traffic he said ships suspected of violating the unordered 
embargo on trade with iraq have been stopped by western warships 
and boarded 
the saudi navy has never fired a shot in anger even during the 
198088 iraniraq war in which dozens of ships were attacked it is 
one of the youngest of the navies in the gulf and faces the 
daunting task of recruiting sailors in a largely bedouin society 
with no tradition of seafaring 
people were not familiar with the sea especially the desert 
people said algathian they feared the sea they thought it 
was dangerous 
the 37yearold officer had to fight family opposition when he 
joined 17 years ago an experience echoed by many crew members 
the navy has tried to make it easier for families to accept 
having their man at sea 
women cannot drive in saudi arabia so the navy has set up 
services on its bases so provisions are available without leaving 
home buses shuttle children to schools through high school level 
on base and women can pick up the telephone and order groceries 
delivered from stores 
frequent newspaper advertisements emphasize that the navy is a 
career an incentive in a country that cannot find jobs for all its 
university graduates 
join the navy for a better future is one current slogan 
study in the united states for officers is another incentive 
navy salaries are five to 10 percent higher than those in other 
forces with new recruits starting at 1000 per month and getting 
automatic annual raises of about 100 a month during their years in 
training officers said 
the navy is also trying to cut its manpower needs by stressing 
computers 
one computer links all the radar system tracking surface air 
and underwater threats to the tabuk for example 
the computer operator can fire all the weapons systems from the 
war room including shiptoship harpoon missiles antiaircraft 
missiles a rapidfire machine gun and a 76millimeter gun 
the chief mechanic can watch all the engine room functions with 
a computer 
as a consequence a ship like the tabuk can be staffed with a 
crew of 75 instead of the normal complement of 150 said 
algathian 
but the navy needs as many men as it can because it wants to 
beef up its forces with more frigates as well as destroyers he 
said a 10yearold campaign made more critical by the iraqi 
invasion 
this area has been in crisis for a long time and the navy is 
trying to catch up with the other armed forces algathian said

a lawyer in a custody dispute over a 
baby born to a surrogate mother suggested the woman never intended 
to turn the boy over to his genetic parents because she coveted a 
white child 
anna johnson the woman hired for 10000 to bear the child 
denied the racial allegation wednesday testifying that she grew 
attached to the baby as it developed in her womb 
theres no way you can prevent your emotions from taking over 
and those instincts come out naturally she said on the second 
day of a superior court hearing to determine custody of the 
3weekold boy 
mark and crispina calvert the couple who hired ms johnson to 
carry a testtube embryo created from their egg and sperm have 
custody of the baby in the meantime 
the hearing was to resume today 
the case is the first in which a surrogate is seeking custody of 
a genetically unrelated child in the baby m case in new jersey 
the surrogate mother was also the genetic one 
christian van deusen the calverts attorney raised the issue 
of race ms johnson 29 has indian white and black ancestry 
mark calvert 34 is white and his wife 36 is filipino 
have you ever told anyone that you always wanted to have a 
white baby van deusen asked ms johnson who firmly replied 
no 
have you ever discussed it with your former roommate he 
asked ms johnson again responded no 
van deusen also questioned ms johnson about her claims that the 
calverts were late in making installment payments of the 10000 as 
stipulated in the contract he produced canceled checks and ms 
johnson agreed that at least one payment was actually made early 
ms johnson a single mother of a 3yearold girl testified she 
changed her mind in june about giving up the baby after mark 
calvert refused to give her a ride to the hospital during a medical 
emergency 
in a july 23 letter introduced as evidence ms johnson told the 
calverts to give her the final 5000 installment or you can 
forget about helping me out calling it a breach of contract and 
not get the baby 
harold laflamme the childs courtappointed attorney asked 
arent you telling them in this letter if they dont cough up 
the money they wont get their baby 
ms johnson denied that saying she was anxious and confused at 
the time because of money and housing worries she had also just 
learned of a welfare fraud investigation which led to her 
conviction on a misdemeanor charge

one candidate is a muscular 38yearold lawyer 
with moviestar looks a lawandorder type who pumps iron at home 
and talks tough on the road his name seems to turn up everywhere 
unfortunately for petermichael diestel its often in nasty 
slogans painted on subway tunnels and the wall around his handsome 
house 
the other candidate is a popular preacher a laidback liberal 
considered the spiritual shepherd of the peaceful revolt that 
toppled east germanys communists a year ago 
unfortunately for the rev manfred stolpe hes not just facing 
an unpopular politician but a powerful political party led by the 
chancellor of a united germany helmut kohl 
stolpe and diestel are the main combatants for governor of 
brandenburg state one of five states that east germany became last 
week when it acceded to west germany 
kohls christian democrats are favored in the other four states 
in sundays balloting mecklenburglower pomerania saxony 
saxonyanhalt and thuringia the leftleaning social democrats 
stolpes party are their main opposition 
of the 10 top candidates for governor four are from what was 
west germany another indication that people from the west are 
poised to assume control of the east 
east germans endured four decades without a free election on 
sunday theyll be voting in their third in eight months with 
another one less than two months away 
the people are fed up with elections said diestel who was 
interior minister in the east germany government that ceased to 
exist last week 
although a light turnout is predicted electing governors and 
state legislatures will help give the old nation a new regional 
identity and greater political voice 
the elections also will advance the process of forming a 
federalist system to replace the centralized bureacracy left by the 
east german communists 
the states will have to quickly assume regional responsibility 
for schools police services transportation and social services 
simultaneous with the east german elections will be the race in 
bavaria the largest of the 11 states on west german territory the 
winner will likely be the reigning christian social union an 
archconservative sister party of the christian democrats 
the christian democrats won east germanys first free elections 
in march dominated the may local elections and are favorites to 
win the germanywide national elections slated for dec 2 
but if the social democrats can win anywhere sunday it is 
brandenburg where they had their best showing in the march 
balloting finishing less than 4 percentage points behind their 
rivals brandenburg surrounds but does not include berlin 
the social democrats who advocate more government control of 
the economy and broader social programs are relying much on the 
eastern territorys economic problems to boost their chances 
stolpe and diestel have basically reflected the views of their 
parties 
both have been running quiet campaigns with stolpe avoiding the 
easy grabbag of diestel controversies 
were both refraining from personal insults stolpe said 
during a campaign stop tuesday in the city of kylritz about 70 
miles northwest of berlin 
we have a young democracy with many economic problems and im 
focusing on the differences between us and the conservative 
party 
diestel was chosen as interior minister by prime minister lothar 
de maiziere in april and has been in hot water since 
the complaint that has energized activists is the number of 
former communist stasi secret police agents he kept on the 
ministry payroll 
so strong are the emotions that diestel put up a security wall 
around the home he recently bought outside berlin a lavish villa 
that once belonged to the former communist regime 
he tore the wall down a few weeks later because it suddenly 
became a new canvas for the graffiti artists who have adopted him 
as their favorite target 
diestel however is a personable popular figure among many 
conservative east germans a dashing bodybuilder and former 
lifeguard he is considered something of a sex symbol 
its been reported that not only was i a stasi member but 
also worked with the israeli secret service and the russian kgb 
he said recently 
perhaps im also mielkes illegitimate son he added 
referring to erich mielke the nowimprisoned former stasi chief 
stolpe was head of the evangelical church in berlin and for 
years acted as mediator between dissidents and the hardline 
communist government 
even though a new poll gave stolpe an approval rating almost 
twice as high as diestels the race is considered virtually even 
a stolpe aide said the problem is not so much diestel as kohl 
whose party may be popular enough to overcome diestels 
controversies

a leading west german counterintelligence 
agent accused of spying for east germany has turned himself in 
prompting the arrests of eight more people in an everwidening 
espionage scandal 
officials said wednesday that the kgb had offered the agent 
klaus kuron asylum in the soviet union at the last minute but that 
kuron declined 
the 54yearold kuron who surrendered over the weekend is 
believed to have supplied large amounts of information about west 
germanys spyfighting efforts to east germany over the past eight 
years 
he is reported to have been one of the most trusted officials at 
the constitutional protection office west germanys main 
spyfighting unit 
on wednesday night the federal prosectors office said eight 
other people had been arrested based on information handed over by 
kuron 
the eight who were not identified are suspected of spying on 
behalf of what was communist east germany until oct 3 
chief federal prosecutor alexander von stahl described the 
kurons espionage activity as a very serious betrayal 
according von stahl kuron agreed to spy for east germany in 
1982 and received a monthly fee of about 2600 the interior 
ministry said the suspect received about that much as his normal 
monthly salary 
interior ministry spokesman willi hausmann said kuron was 
offered entry into the soviet union by the kgb just before 
surrending but the soviets offer did not appear lucrative to 
him so he turned himself in instead 
hausmann gave no further details 
on tuesday justice officials announced the sept 30 arrest of a 
47yearold woman working for the german intelligence service 
which is also responsible for foreign intelligence work 
the woman identified as gabriele g is suspected of having 
passed intelligence documents prepared for kohl on to the east 
german secret police 
justice officials have said they are worried that former east 
german agents may now offer their services and important 
information to the kgb 
chief government spokesman hans klein on wednesday urged all 
former east german agents spies without a country to turn 
themselves in rather then seek refuge elsewhere 
dozens of east german agents have surrendered over the past few 
months more than 60 others have been arrested but others are 
still on the loose

an exiled chinese poet was the focus of 
the literary world today amid speculation the swedish academy would 
award the nobel prize to a chinese writer for the first time in its 
89year history 
the academy was to make its final choice in a vote this morning 
and make the announcement at the stroke of 1 pm 8 am edt 
bei dao whose somber short stories and poems have been praised 
for their depiction of personal dramas entwined in the political 
vicissitudes of communist china was said to be a strong candidates 
for the 700000 prize 
others said to be in the running were gaelic novelist seamus 
heaney us novelist joyce carol oates mexican poet octavio paz 
brazilian novelist jorge amado west indians vs naipaul and derek 
walcott turkeys yasar kemal margaret atwood of canada south 
african writer nadine gordimer and japanese novelist masuji ibuse 
the academy long has been criticized for ignoring chinas 
3000yearold literary tradition and giving short shrift to asia 
as a whole 
there have only been two asian winners in the history of the 
prize first given in 1901 indian poet rabindranath tagore won the 
nobel in 1913 and japanese writer yasunaro kawabata was chosen in 
1968 
sweden by comparison has had six laureates 
the addition of chinese language professor goran malmqvist to 
the 18member academy in 1985 has put the board in a position to 
assess original writings from the chinese 
bei dao was born in 1949 the year the communists came to power 
in china 
he entered adulthood during the cultural revolution which 
lasted from 1966 to 1976 and beis interpreters say the feeling of 
terror that pervades much of his poetry can be linked to the 
violence of this period 
bei was a guiding voice for young chinese writers during a 
period of greater democracy in china from 197679 
in february 1989 he helped organize a petition seeking the 
release of political prisoners he left china for a conference two 
months later just as the prodemocracy movement began in beijing 
bei never returned and currently teaches chinese at the 
university of aarhus in denmark 
sources say bei was a strong candidate for the prize last year 
but some writers have been rumored to be on the short list for 
years 
female writers have rarely been awarded the prize 
germanswedish poet nelly sachs the last woman laureate in 1966 
was only the sixth woman to win the prize 
the prize was established in the 1896 will of alfred nobel the 
swedish philanthropist and inventor of dynamite

there arent many political parties 
like the illinois solidarity party 
the gubernatorial candidate doesnt care if she wins a 
congressional candidate wants to switch every electrical system in 
america to direct current the candidate for university of illinois 
trustee is counting on big election day turnout among indians 
and the 4yearold organization is fighting for its survival 
unless one of solidaritys statewide candidates captures at 
least 5 percent of the vote this year the party no longer will be 
considered an established party automatically entitled to a spot on 
the ballot 
the partys biggest votegetter in 1988 trustee candidate 
martin ortega received 98000 votes less than 1 percent of the 
ballots cast in an 11person field 
illinois solidarity whose current leaders say they want to 
create an alternative to the two traditional parties was founded 
by one of the most prominent members of the states political 
establishment democrat adlai stevenson iii 
when stevenson won the democratic nomination for governor in 
1986 followers of extremist lyndon larouche were nominated for 
lieutenant governor and secretary of state stevenson refused to 
have anything to do with them and resigned from the ticket 
to keep his gubernatorial hopes alive stevenson collected 
signatures gathered running mates and created his own party 
illinois solidarity 
the party was formed just for that purpose with the intent of 
killing it after the election said terry stephan stevensons 
deputy press secretary in the 1986 race 
plenty of groups have formed third parties in illinois but none 
was led by an established politician like stevenson the party won 
enough votes to be listed on state ballots for the next four years 
but it didnt help stevenson avoid a sound defeat 
then gov james r thompson motivated by nothing but a 
desire for mischief stephan said vetoed a bill that would have 
killed the party by merging it with the democratic party thompson 
a republican said the bill was unconstitutional 
since then the party has stood abandoned by stevenson but open 
to anyone who wants to call himself an illinois solidarity 
candidate in 1987 for instance exdemocrat laterrepublican ed 
vrdolyak ran unsuccessfully for mayor of chicago under the 
solidarity banner 
but since 1988 solidarity has been a blackled progay 
prosocialist coalition according to gubernatorial candidate dr 
jessie fields a chicago physician 
im not expecting to win the election she said this is 
about much more than winning some high office 
the groups goal is to include more people and more opinions in 
a political process they see as riddled with problems brought on by 
the influence of money 
these things arent going to respond to anything but a dose of 
grassroots democracy said solidarity activist alan port he is 
running a writein campaign for the congressional seat that 
includes peoria 
port runs on a platform calling for reducing the military to a 
purely defensive force with no personnel overseas he also wants to 
change all electrical systems so people can draw power from special 
hydrogen generators he says have been invented 
the handful of solidarity candidates try to spread the word on 
shoestring budgets and time limited by jobs as doctors 
veterinarians night watchmen 
they stand on street corners giving pamphlets to passersby 
they speak to student groups and community organizations other 
than that their campaign is invisible no posters no tv 
commercials no debate appearances 
her exclusion from the league of women voters debates irks 
fields she said shes caught in a trap debates dont include her 
because few people know about her and people dont get to know her 
without the exposure of debates 
but the candidates predict theyll do well just by offering an 
alternative 
we may not be much port said but were all theyve got 
at this point

new motionsensitive light switches installed 
at a university are keeping professors on their toes 
traditional toggle switches were replaced by the energysaving 
devices in 180 offices at california state university at 
northridge 
professors say it was a dimwitted idea 
there was a woman across the hall engaging in all sorts of 
gymnastics in her office to keep the light on said professor max 
lupal who had the device removed because it observed only a wall 
and didnt pick up movement 
his colleague james sefton complained he had to get up from his 
chair 10 times in three hours and wave to convince the switch he 
was there 
university engineer alan mcdonald said the 110 switches were 
part of a 11 million energysaving project the entire cost of 
the watt watcher switches was 20000 
university manager martin holzman said the switches are expected 
to pay for themselves in about six years 
english professor marvin klotz said it would have been cheaper 
to keep the oldfashioned switches he and his colleagues are 
entirely capable of remembering to turn off the lights when they 
leave he said

state officials have come up with a plan 
to remove and store two highly radioactive uranium fuel assemblies 
dangling precariously inside the indian point 3 nuclear reactor 
the 14foot 1200pound assemblies were accidentally pulled 
from the core of the reactor during refueling last week and became 
snagged they are far too radioactive for workers to try to fix the 
problem and put them back in place 
officials are worried the assemblies could drop back into the 
core damaging equipment and releasing radioactive gases inside the 
plant 
the new york power authority which owns and operates the plant 
wants to move the assemblies to special steel baskets in a storage 
area next the reactor and eventually transfer them to the plants 
spent fuel rod storage pool spokesman carl patrick said wednesday 
the agency planned to present the proposal to the nuclear 
regulatory commission today or friday for approval said another 
authority spokesman todd forte 
both assemblies consist of 204 thin metal rods and hold hundreds 
of ceramic uranium pellets they are dangling in water from a heavy 
metal plate suspended from a crane 
nrc spokesman karl abraham has said radiation wouldnt escape 
the plant if the assemblies fell 
the 14yearold plant was removed from service sept 15 for 
refueling and maintenance 
other work in the containment building has been suspended until 
the problem is solved forte said it isnt clear how long the 
problem would delay electricity production which was supposed to 
resume by thanksgiving weekend 
indian point 3 a 600megawatt reactor is about 35 miles north 
of new york city

in an attempt to win back voters the leaders of 
italys communist party have decided to abandon communism in name 
and philosophy and become a more mainstream leftist party 
the leadership on wednesday backed party secretary achille 
occhettos proposal that the largest communist organization in the 
west and the secondlargest political group in italy be named 
democratic party of the left 
the final vote comes at a special party congress in january and 
occhetto commands a majority in the party 
the leaderships decision was more than a year in the making 
it was aimed at keeping pace with the changes sweeping europe 
reversing an electoral slide and ending the stigma that has kept 
the party out of national government for 43 years 
in a speech wednesday to party members occhetto modified the 
partys emblem a hammer sickle and star in the new symbol the 
emblem would be smaller and depicted beneath a tree symbolizing 
liberty strong roots and love of nature occhetto said 
a small group of hardliners burned a copy of the proposed 
symbol outside party headquarters the italian news agency agi 
reported 
in his speech occhetto criticized the communist model of rigid 
centralized economies while calling for regulation to protect the 
poor and the environment 
he appealed to the party to embrace the interests of workers 
feminists environmentalists pacifists and leftist catholics and 
called on the socialists italys no 3 party to unite to form a 
government 
the socialists have been lukewarm to occhettos proposals and 
indicated the party would still not be welcome in the noncommunist 
socialist international 
the socialists who have been coalition partners with the 
conservative christian democrats in the last decade hope to 
surpass the communists and become de facto leaders of the italian 
left 
occhetto presented the proposed name change at a meeting of his 
party leadership taking personal responsibility for the radical 
turn he said the new symbol would include the hammer and sickle to 
represent the historical function of the workers movement 
in recent elections the communists have held on to their no 2 
position but have dropped from the 34 percent of the vote received 
in 1976 when they came to the brink of power to around 27 
percent 
it has been even lower in some local elections 
still in a europe that has seen ruling communist parties 
toppled in the east and the once powerful french party reduced to 
less than 7 percent of the vote italys communists stand out as 
major votegetters 
occhetto won support for radical change at a special party 
congress in march but at the price of a split with hardline 
communists 
his plan won 66 percent of the vote with 34 percent of the 
delegates known as the no front opposed 
the party split surfaced again in august on a parliamentary vote 
on italys participation in the multinational naval task force in 
the persian gulf 
occhetto and his mainline allies abstained on the vote while the 
no front voted against 
the italian communist party was formed in 1921 in a breakway 
from the socialists it went underground during fascism played a 
major role in the resistance and briefly served in coalition 
governments after world war ii 
but it has been locked out of the central government since 1947 
although it holds many key posts in the country 
the italian communists long ago proclaimed their independence 
from moscow when an international communist front was seen as a 
threat to the west 
they have also supported italys membership in nato although 
the us government has been wary of their stand on strategic 
issues

the magellan spacecraft has found sand 
dunes on venus despite low wind and little loose sediment on the 
planet 
they look a lot like sand dunes on earth said ray arvidson 
a geologist from washington university in st louis and a magellan 
scientist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
this is a fairly rare occurrence on venus he said 
wednesday this area just had a beautiful supply of sediment to 
be reworked into dunes 
magellans pictures revealed the dune field in an area of los 
angelessized meteorite craters the field is 30 to 40 miles long 
and each dune is hundreds of yards wide arvidson said magellan 
hasnt determined their height 
magellans images have shown venus has very little loose 
sediment thats because the planet lacks water to erode rock 
surface winds on venus measure only a few miles per hour but 
the atmosphere is so dense that even such light winds can lift 
sediment he said atmospheric pressure on venus surface is 90 
times the pressure at sea level on earth 
arvidson said the sediment that was blown around to form the 
dunes may have stemmed from a meteorite impact that shattered or 
melted rock another possibility is that the meteorite was a 
waterrich comet he added 
magellan bounces radar off venus to make pictures and maps of 
the planet which cant be photographed with optical cameras 
because of its thick cloud cover 
the pictures have shown numerous volcanoes volcanic collapse 
craters long rivers of solidified lava extensive faults deep 
valleys and towering ridges 
magellan began orbiting venus on aug 10 after a roundabout trip 
from earth of 948 million miles the spacecraft was launched from 
the shuttle atlantis in may 1989 magellan and venus were 1586 
million miles from earth on wednesday

republican pierre rinfret is asking voters to 
support his underdog campaign for governor by calling a 1900 
number at 995 a call to hear a recorded message from him 
the number is being promoted in a 60second tv commercial in 
which rinfret calls on voters to get rid of democratic gov 
mario cuomo because he opposes the death penalty the ad was to 
begin airing today on wwor 
rinfrets cashstrapped campaign paid 25000 to have the ad run 
nine times over three days said john denny deputy campaign 
manager 
each call will bring the campaign 8 
its not a sign of trouble dont be silly rinfret said at 
a news conference its a sign of innovation why do i have to do 
everything the old way 
rinfrets campaign also spent 26000 to promote a 1900 number 
in radio and newspaper ads nd direct mailings that number is 
cheaper it costs 5 of which 3 will go to the campaign but 
its message is the same 
denny said 53 radio spots will run on five or six stations 
last week rinfret who is trailing badly in the polls and is 
given practically no chance of beating cuomo reported that his 
campaign had less than 94000 in the bank he also reported 
188571 in unpaid bills 
cuomo reported having almost 61 million in his campaign

energy secretary james watkins has ordered 
a new assessment of nuclear waste storage dangers at hanford in 
response to a federal report warning that an explosion could give 
nearby residents cancer 
the report on storage tanks at the governments nuclear weapons 
complex was released wednesday by the general accounting office it 
contradicted a 1987 study that suggested a tank explosion would 
pose little risk to area residents 
watkins ordered a new environmental impact statement to replace 
the 1987 study which was prepared by battelle pacific northwest 
laboratory a hanford contractor 
watkins said the 1987 study greatly underestimated the 
consequences of a cyanide explosion in underground tanks 
the gao report agreed with previous energy department 
assessments that the actual risk of an explosion is low but it 
cautioned that not enough is known to rule the possibility out 
a cyanide explosion would blast a hole through a tanks roof 
and people living near the 560squaremile hanford reservation in 
southcentral washington could receive enough radiation to cause 
cancer the gao said 
if an explosion did occur our review indicates that it would 
be a major accident with potentially more damaging effects than 
those described in the 1987 hanford eis the gao said 
rep mike synar dokla requested the report as part of a 
house government operations committee investigation of nuclear 
waste handling practices the gao is the investigative arm of 
congress 
hanford has 177 underground storage tanks of those 22 are 
singleshell tanks that contain a chemical called ferrocyanide 
added in the 1950s to separate radioactive substances from liquids 
so the liquids could be pumped out no new wastes have been added 
to those tanks for years 
a 1984 study concluded tanks containing ferrocyanide carried an 
explosion risk but that report was suppressed by doe until last 
year 
hanford was created during the manhattan project of the early 
1940s and since then has processed plutonium for weapons some 
plutonium processing continues but much of the work at hanford now 
involves cleaning up decades of nuclear waste

the president of the motion picture 
association of america says an alabama newspaper that rejected 
advertising for the first movie released with the new nc17 rating 
is living in the stone age 
the birmingham news an afternoon newspaper with a circulation 
of 180000 became the first newspaper in the country to take such 
action 
the newspaper which previously banned ads for xrated movies 
said it would refuse ad copy for the universal pictures release 
henry amp june and for all subsequent nc17 films 
i cant tell the publisher how to do his business but the 
reasonable sane and fair way to do things is to find out what the 
picture is before you decide to ban its advertising said jack 
valenti president of the motion picture association 
thats what the new york times and all intelligent newspapers 
are doing if a newspaper wants to live in the stone age i cant 
do anything about it he said 
universal spokesman allan sutton said the alabama newspaper was 
the first and only newspper to ban nc17 ads 
the ban came on the eve of the movies friday opening at 
birminghams colonnade part of the columbus gabased carmike 
theater chain universal said it is heavily advertising the movie 
on radio 
featuring two lesbian sex scenes and a shot of an erotic 
drawing henry amp june is based on the diaries of anais nin and 
chronicles her affairs with writer henry miller and his wife 
the associations new rating excludes anyone under 18 and 
replaces the xrating 
the x designation was long considered box office poison by the 
studios because of its association with hardcore sex and the 
inability to place media ads 
in a sunday editorial the birmingham news said smut was still 
smut and the nc17 rating could lead to more violent or erotic 
fare drawing audiences that might have been turned off by the 
stigma of an x rating 
the new york times and the los angeles times didnt accept 
xrated movie ads but have decided to permit ads for nc17rated 
films 
henry amp june opened to sellout audiences in its first 
weekend of limited release it took in 868000 in 76 theaters for 
a robust 11427 perscreen average 
last week in dedham mass the showcase cinema canceled a 
showing of henry amp june after two town selectmen claimed the 
nc17 rating essentially meant the film was xrated 
these are isolated cases in my judgment valenti said im 
not concerned i just think in time sensibility and sanity will 
prevail and the first amendment will live hallelujah

a 4yearold girls cut finger prompted 
state officials to begin investigating the safety of a type of 
slap bracelet 
walgreens pulled a taiwanmade brand of the popular toys from 16 
connecticut stores after the girls father complained 
the toy consists of a 9inch strip of metal encased in cloth 
when the strip is slapped against the wrist it wraps itself around 
a wearers arm 
when nicole tomaso wrapped the bracelet she got at walgreens 
around her wrist tuesday a piece of metal popped out of the cloth 
and she cut her finger said her father joseph tomaso 
nicoles bracelet was a copy of slap wraps which are made by 
main street toy in simsbury and have become a fad with children 
slap wraps sell for 249 the imitations cost 99 cents 
the state department of consumer protection on wednesday began 
investigating the taiwanmade bracelets for possibly dangerous 
sharp edges said joan jordan the departments product safety 
supervisor 
the slap wrap brand isnt included in the investigation she 
said 
the state could recall the toy if it is found to violate the 
states child protection act which bars nonfunctional sharp edges 
on toys sold to children 8 years old and youngerr jordan said 
elementary school officials in pelham ny banned the wraps 
last week because of concerns about children cutting themselves 
main street toy maintains its bracelets made with stainless 
steel are safe but says imitations are made from cheaper steel 
that will rust and break 
we presented our item to walgreens in july or august but they 
turned us down because the other item was cheaper said deb 
baker marketing vice president for main street toy

an iraqi airways jetliner with more than 350 western evacuees 
from iraq and kuwait landed in britain today in the first such 
flight in nearly three weeks most of the passengers were americans 
and many were children 
ten weeks after iraqi troops overran his country kuwaits 
ambassador to the united states predicted that the unordered 
embargo on trade with baghdad will fail to force an iraqi 
withdrawal 
saddam husseins forces are tightening their grip on oilrich 
kuwait said the ambassador saud nasir alsabah and are confident 
they can outlast the usled multinational force arrayed against 
them in saudi arabia 
speaking in washington on wednesday alsabah did not however 
go as far as to urge that the united states take military action 
against iraq 
you can reach your own conclusions he said 
the persian gulf crisis continued to wear on the us economy 
oil prices briefly hit a record 4115 a barrel on the new york 
exchange on wednesday before closing at 3869 tumbling on an 
erroneous rumor that saddam had been killed 
on the new york stock exchange the dow jones industrial average 
fell 3762 points to 240792 its lowest level since may 1989 
the uschartered boeing 747 from iraq landed at gatwick 
airport outside london this morning after leaving baghdad earlier 
in the day it was the first such evacuation flight since sept 22 
the british foreign office said about 360 passengers were on the 
flight 
us embassy spokeswoman nola day said there were quite a few 
less than expected on board a lot can happen between kuwait and 
baghdad the embassy had expected close to 400 passengers 
mohammad issa a language teacher from bridgeport conn with 
dual us and jordanian nationality said conditions in kuwait were 
miserable with people having to stand in line for bread for 
gas for everything 
robbie faddah of houston clutching her daughter laila also 
told reporters food supplies were very low iraqi troops were 
spread throughout the city and many cars and trucks were being 
bombed probably by the kuwaiti resistance 
her husband hani faddah an electronics engineer who also has 
dual us and jordanian nationality said people are getting 
scared now it has become like lebanon it is descending into a 
civil war 
the americans and canadians on the flight were to leave friday 
from london on a chartered flight for raleighdurham international 
airport in north carolina said andrew varney gatwick airports 
director of public affairs 
until today freedom flights had transported about 1900 
americans out of iraq and kuwait recent state department estimates 
indicated more than 600 americans were stranded in kuwait and more 
than 300 in iraq 
american and other western men are being held in iraq and 
kuwait many at strategic iraqi installations to deter any possible 
attack 
in washington the kuwaiti ambassador alsabah said 
international sanctions imposed on iraq after its aug 2 invasion 
will fail because saddams economy is selfsufficient in food 
i dont believe iraq in the short or long run will be 
adversely affected by the sanctions he told a hearing of the 
house human rights caucus a loose organization of us lawmakers 
interested in human rights issues 
iraqs border with jordan also remains open to truck traffic 
and aircraft still land in amman and transfer their cargo to trucks 
that then poke holes in the embargo the ambassador said 
sanctions will not bring iraq down to its knees and force it 
out of kuwait alsaban said 
he said the embargo was being further undermined by the central 
banks in other countries who are providing credit lines to iraq 
although he declined to name the countries 
saddam husseins policy now is to sit tight to strengthen 
his grip on kuwait and to outlast the patience of the multinational 
forces alsabah said he hopes to break the alliance and he 
believes time is on his side 
it is generally agreed however that the un embargo has all 
but suceeded in preventing iraq from exporting the oil that had 
been its leading foreign currency earner 
saddam seized kuwait in a dispute over oil money and land and 
in so doing boosted his share of world crude reserves to 20 
percent the iraqis have moved an estimated 460000 troops into the 
captive kingdom 
more than 200000 us soldiers are stationed across the border 
in saudi arabia and aboard warships in the region thousands of 
arab and european troops also have been deployed in the 
multinational force standing up to saddam

democrat lawton chiles in a move that 
could make abortion a major issue in floridas gubernatorial 
campaign has come down squarely on the prochoice side 
his opponent republican gov bob martinez is fiercely 
antiabortion 
chiles a former us senator staked out his position on the 
anniversary of martinezs failed attempt to push through 
restrictions on abortion 
as a senator chiles voted against additional spending on 
abortions and voted for a constitutional amendment taking away the 
guaranteed right to an abortion 
but he said wednesday his position has changed and that he 
wanted to clear up any confusion over his views 
i am not proabortion ive always been opposed to abortion 
chiles said but when it comes down to who makes that decision i 
think we want the woman to be able to make it 
chiles has pledged to veto any legislation restricting a womans 
right to choose but he admitted he had trouble with the label 
prochoice until recently because it was equated with 
that we dont care about life 
he said that if elected he would try to reduce the number of 
abortions by increasing spending on family planning sex education 
and school health services and to improve prenatal care 
chiles made his comments during a prochoice forum at the 
capitol where a year ago thousands demonstrated while lawmakers 
shot down martinezs proposals to limit abortions the session was 
the first in the nation after the us supreme courts webster 
ruling gave states greater authority on the abortion question 
abortion so far hasnt been a major campaign issue 
if abortion is an issue i would say the governor made that an 
issue when he called a special session last year chiles said 
i dont think any one issue will decide the campaign 
martinez has repeatedly said he felt compelled to call the 
session after the webster ruling because of his deep personal 
opposition to abortion 
jm mac stipanovich martinezs campaign manager said 
its an interesting contrast between the governors principles on 
this issue and lawton chiles prostitution of it 
the national abortion rights action league took out fullpage 
ads wednesday in several newspapers with the headline we 
remember governor martinez urging people to vote against 
martinez on nov 6

the editor of the communist party newspaper pravda 
says he has survived a mutiny by reporters who say they want to 
raise plummeting circulation by replacing rambling speech text with 
readable copy 
pravda today published an unsigned denial of reports that the 
newspapers communist party organization called last week for the 
resignation of ivan frolov who was appointed editor one year ago 
the notice buried on page eight acknowledged that the 
newspapers party organization had sharp sometimes tough 
discussions during two days of meetings and that criticism of the 
leadership was expressed 
but it said the meetings did not adopt a noconfidence 
resolution in the chief editor 
frolov said at an unusual news conference on wednesday that 
these people thought they could organize a minicoup 
outside in the hallway pravda writers held what they called a 
parallel news conference about their efforts to unseat frolov 
they said they sought to improve the newspaper officially 
described as the organ of the central committee of the communist 
party 
pravda satirist vladislav yegorov told reporters leaving the 
frolov news conference that the party organization at the newspaper 
had passed a resolution asking the central committee to review 
the question of the editorial board 
he said that 140 workers at pravda who are members of the 
communist party cell had considered calling for frolovs 
resignation but dropped the idea as too provocative 
last year pravdas circulation dropped by 3 million to about 7 
million and it appears to be falling further during a subscription 
drive now under way yegorov said 
he said readers were bored by the format of pravda which this 
week has devoted its pages to the full texts of speeches from a 
twoday meeting of the communist partys central committee a body 
of diminishing relevance in soviet politics 
our readers dont want that said yegorov the most 
important thing is to make it a newspaper that is interesting to 
readers 
the supreme soviet parliament has erased limits on the 
circulation of periodicals but subscribers must sign up this fall 
for publications they wish to receive next year 
yegorov told reporters that subscribers in one central russian 
town which he declined to identify had fallen from 9000 to 240 
in the current subscription drive 
frolov said the central committee told him he could keep his 
job president mikhail s gorbachev appointed him to replace viktor 
afanasyev who had run the paper under longtime soviet leader leonid 
brezhnev 
the central committee will examine what has been happening and 
what we will do next frolov told reporters in a rambling 
hourlong discourse 
he said that all soviet newspapers will feel a shock from 
the 1991 circulation figures 
tamara hlyupova secretary to pravdas editorial board said the 
1991 figures were not available but acknowledged the subscription 
drive is going very badly indeed

after 18 hours of wrangling the security 
council was deadlocked early today over lastminute plo demands on 
a resolution condemning israel for excessive use of force in 
the temple mount killings 
we have a couple of issues still to be settled us 
ambassador thomas r pickering said as weary representatives broke 
up a series of meetings at 4 am exiting palestine liberation 
organization officials declined to comment 
the plo had suddenly insisted that the united nations assume 
some responsibility for the safety and welfare of palestinians in 
the west bank gaza strip and east jerusalem which israel seized 
in the 1967 middle east war 
thats not a resolution we can support in there you all know 
that pickering said during the bargaining 
the united states earlier decision to join in denouncing israel 
its traditionally close middle east ally had already outraged 
jewish groups which flooded the us mission to the united nations 
with phone calls 
agreement on the temple mount resolution had appeared at hand 
late wednesday after us diplomats agreed to temper criticism of 
palestinians involved in the confrontation that led to mondays 
killings 
nineteen palestinians were killed and 140 wounded by israeli 
forces that opened fire on arabs who were pelting jewish worshipers 
with stones more than 20 israelis were injured 
as part of the agreement the plo and its nonaligned allies 
gave up their demand that the security council send three members 
to jerusalem to investigate instead it was agreed that 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar would send his own 
emissaries 
israel has rejected any security council mission as infringing 
on its sovereignty but has accepted personal emissaries of the 
secretarygeneral in the past 
but as the council was being called into formal session early 
today the plo registered new objections it said it wanted perez 
de cuellars emissaries to recommend a course of action not just 
present conclusions as the draft resolution states 
the united states objected saying that the fourth geneva 
convention on the welfare of civilians in areas under military 
occupation makes it clear that israel is responsible for those in 
the occupied territories 
later today the plo representative to the united nations was 
asked why his organization was driving such a hard bargain in the 
security council 
we would like to see the un going back to what the un was 
established for namely that there should be a united united 
nations against agression and mass murder zuhdi terzi told abc 
news 
the united states normally shields israel from rebuke in the 
security council and has not supported condemnation of israel in 
the body since the jewish states 1982 invasion of lebanon 
but a us veto of a temple mount resolution would drive a wedge 
between the united states and moderate arabs who have banded 
together to isolate iraq for its aug 2 invasion and occupation of 
kuwait 
the original us draft resolution marked the first time the 
united states sponsored a council resolution condemning the jewish 
state it criticized israel for using excessive force against 
palestinian rioters 
the new yorkbased conference of presidents of major jewish 
organizations denounced the ussupported draft resolution as 
harsh and hypocritical 
at the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles rabbi marvin hier 
accused washington of giving iraqi president saddam hussein and plo 
chairman yasser arafat a diplomatic victory in an attempt to 
curry favor with the arabs 
egypt saudi arabia morocco and other arab states including 
kuwaits government in exile say israels occupation of gaza and 
the west bank is just as offensive as saddams invasion of kuwait 
saddam has been trying to link the withdrawal of his iraqi 
troops from kuwait with an israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories 
the last time the united states supported criticism of israel in 
the security council was in january 1988 when it endorsed a 
resolution urging israel to halt deportations of activists in the 
palestinian uprising 
the most dramatic instances of us condemnation of israel were 
in 1982 over the invasion of lebanon to force out the plo and 1981 
over israels destruction of an iraqi nuclear reactor

several cities in the northwestern galicia region before dawn 
today including one in a discotheque that killed three people and 
injured 46 police said 
a seventh bomb was defused 
officials said the three killed in the santiago de compostela 
disco bombing were believed to have been planting the device when 
it went off 
no one was injured in the five bombings which targeted 
businesses in another province pontevedra its civil govrnor 
jorge parada told reporters 
civil governor ramon berra of la coruna province which includes 
santiago de compostela told spanish national radio that police 
were investigating whether drug traffickers might be behind the 
disco blast 
a galician separatist group claimed responsibility for the 
pontevedra bombings said parada which hit a clothing boutique a 
car dealership a canning factory a bar and a bank office 
parada said police bomb experts defused a bomb at a bank in the 
pontevedra province town of villa garcia after a telephoned bomb 
threat by the same group 
the group the guerrilla army of the free galician people seeks 
independence from spain for the fourprovince northwestern region 
of galicia but has been relatively inactive recently parada said 
a police spokesman earlier said a caller claimed the club blast 
also was the work of galician separatists but the spokesman later 
denied it he said drug traffickers as well as the separatists were 
suspected 
the disco blast killed a man and two women believed to have been 
handling the bomb when it went off behind a stack of speakers a 
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity earlier police 
reported that three women had died 
the five other bombs exploded afterward in villagarcia de arosa 
villanueva de arosa cambados and the provincial capital of 
pontevedra police said 
they damaged businesses owned by or linked to alleged galician 
cocaine traffickers police said

of colombian cocaine who were among the more than 30 people jailed 
in june during the countrys largest police antidrug operation 
that operation focused on longtime galician smugglers of 
contraband us tobacco along galicias long jagged coast who have 
become prime distributors in europe of colombian cocaine 
parada said the galician separatist groups attacks against 
property linked to drug traffickers could be an attempt to gain 
public favor

stanford university officials will 
monitor a new policy that gives unmarried couples including 
homosexuals benefits usually given to the legally married 
the impact is impossible to predict at this point said norm 
robinson the schools acting dean of student affairs 
the university board of trustees decision announced tuesday 
gives samesex and unmarried couples the same rights as legally 
married students entitling domestic partners to housing and 
university services such as access to library and athletic 
facilities 
robinson said the policy would prevent students from having to 
choose between stanford and their love interest 
the change also affirms stanfords policy of not 
discriminating against students on a variety of factors including 
sexual orientation robinson said in a statement 
homosexual men and women will be eligible to rent onebedroom 
campus apartments in a complex previously reserved for legally 
married couples 
this is a significant stepping stone in recognizing the 
legitimacy of all relationships said steven petrow director of 
public affairs for national gay rights advocates a san 
franciscobased group that works for the equal treatment of 
homosexual couples

the test program assistant air force secretary john j welch 
told the los angeles times frankly we had hoped to have both of 
these vehicles in the air by now 
while saying that testing of the second bomber is nine months 
behind schedule welch added that all the test results we have 
had to date are very encouraging 
the first b2 made its first flight on july 17 1989 about 18 
months behind schedule it has flown 15 times in 15 months 
the second b2 originally was scheduled to fly last spring 
neither the air force nor northrop have released scheduling 
information in northrops contract to build the planes 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio contended the company is only 
one month behind schedule he attributed the delays to deferred 
disbursements of federal funding and a strike by workers at 
subcontractor boeing corp 
the strike resulted in a contract change that shifted the secon 
bombers flight date to late summer cantafio said 
the b2 can carry nuclear or conventional weapons and is 
intended to replace the nations aging b52 strategic bomber fleet 
its stealth technology is designed to foil enemy radar 
the b2 program has been attacked by some members of congress 
for its projected cost of up to 754 billion

nasa pronounced an end to its 
losing streak after discovery completed a nearly troublefree 
mission that sent a probe on a mission to explore the sun 
we showed the world that the shuttle and nasa is reliable and 
can meet their commitments said aaron cohen director of the 
johnson space center 
the shuttle and its five astronauts swooped out of orbit and 
glided to a landing at edwards air force base calif on wednesday 
after a fourday flight it was nasas first shuttle mission in six 
months 
only a few problems were reported from blastoff to touchdown 
including a computer programming error discovered after takeoff 
that was considered serious but no threat to the shuttle or crew 
said milt heflin lead flight director 
well today the losing streak is over discovery commander 
richard n richards said 
if you criticize our mistakes then you must also acknowledge 
our successes shuttle director and former astronaut robert 
crippen said 
nasa had been unable to fly a shuttle since april when the 
hubble space telescope was put into orbit later scientists found 
the 15 billion telescope had a flawed mirror 
hydrogen leaks have grounded shuttles columbia and atlantis for 
months although atlantis is set for launch in early november on a 
secret military flight columbias troubles have not been resolved 
the fact that discovery flew and they had such a textbook 
mission really makes us feel good said conrad nagel a nasa 
official in charge of atlantis prelaunch operations 
atlantis mission will be the fifth and final shuttle flight for 
1990 four fewer than planned unless columbias leaks can be 
repaired in time for a late november or december launch 
discoverys launch ended the longest gap between shuttle 
missions since flights resumed following the 1986 challenger 
accident 
the shuttle blasted into orbit from cape canaveral fla on 
saturday several hours later the crew sent the 250 million 
ulysses probe on a 186billionmile journey to explore the suns 
poles 
racing along at more than 25000 mph ulysses was 31 million 
miles from earth on wednesday nasa said the spacecraft will swing 
past jupiter in 1992 and use the planets gravity to sling it back 
toward the sun 
discoverys computer error was made before launch but was 
discovered when the astronauts were converting the shuttles five 
computers from launch operations to orbital operations heflin 
said 
automatic safeguards on discovery would have prevented any 
problem even if the crew hadnt discovered the error heflin said 
but the mistake was serious because if we erred in some 
procedures on the ground why did we not catch it 
the problem involved computer no 4 used for housekeeping 
tasks including monitoring discoverys propulsion electrical and 
lifesupport systems 
when the astronauts called up a computerized display of 
instructions for the computer they found the screen had been 
incorrectly loaded with instructions intended for computer no 2 
heflin said 
discovery touched down on pavement in the second such test to 
determine if shuttles can land at cape canaveral crippen said the 
brakes apparently performed well but he wont decide until spring 
when to have shuttles touch down in florida

the missouri knights of the ku klux klan 
must stop playing racist telephone recordings that imitate the 
mister rogers childrens television show a federal judge has 
ruled 
us district judge howard f sachs on wednesday also ordered 
the klan and three of its alleged members to turn over tape 
recordings and other materials that lawyers for the program say 
infringe on its trademarks and copyrights 
sachs issued the temporary restraining order one day after fred 
m rogers and his family communications inc sued to stop the 
klans use of the recording the message imitates the sound effects 
and song of the mister rogers television show and rogers voice 
and speech patterns 
the messages are of racism white supremacy and bigotry the 
antithesis of everything rogers and family communications inc 
stand for said cynthia e kernick a lawyer for rogers from 
pittsburgh 
a group of civil rights community and religious leaders 
complained last week that the number for a telephone in 
independence that played the racist message had been circulated 
among elementary and middle school students in the metropolitan 
area 
the same phone number was used earlier this year to promote the 
philosophy of the missouri knights of the klan 
the lawsuit names the klan and adam troy mercer of independence 
michael brooks also known as mb madison of kansas city and 
edward e stephens also of kansas city 
attempts to reach mercer madison and stephens were 
unsuccessful 
the judge set a hearing on a preliminary injunction for oct 20 
sachs declined to issue a civil search warrant allowing us 
marshals to search for the tapes at the defendants residences

mobil tried to protect its upper management 
by having its environmental auditors fudge their reports on federal 
violations a former environmental manager for the oil giant says 
philip olson made his claim wednesday at a trial in us 
district court where valcar bowman is suing mobil oil corp 
bowman a former mobil environmental officer says the company 
fired him in 1986 for opposing a coverup of environmental problems 
at a california plant 
bowman wants his job back as well as back pay and reimbursement 
for legal fees 
olson testified in the fiveweekold trial that bowman was fired 
for having political problems with upper management 
mobil denies bowmans claims the company says bowman was let go 
for insubordination and disobedience and as part of a costcutting 
effort at its mobil chemical corp subsidiary 
in testimony wednesday olson said inspectors spoke candidly 
with mobil managers but were careful in their notes and reports not 
to leave a paper trail that investigators could trace to higher 
executives 
olson said he saw environmental violations at the refineries he 
audited he used an analogy to illustrate how mobil wanted reports 
made 
lets say the speed limit is 55 and we saw a company vehicle 
go in excess of 55 he testified wed say we saw it going in 
excess of 50 
mobil has argued that selfpolicing eliminated the need for 
government oversight of plant inspections and audits 
bowman was fired after a los angeles county district attorney 
made an unannounced search of mobils oil refinery in torrance 
calif and confiscated documents detailing alleged air pollution 
violations 
after that the company ordered certain company records from the 
mobil chemical plant in bakersfield cal be brought to its 
outside lawyer bowmans staff was ordered to move the documents 
charles lindberg mobils chief inhouse lawyer said this was 
done in the belief that attorneyclient privilege would keep the 
documents confidential and out of investigators hands 
bowman says he opposed transferring the documents as unethical 
and immoral and that mobil knew an inspection of the plant was 
imminent

the violence of goodfellas and other current 
mob movies hasnt rattled those who crusade against rap and heavy 
metal but in the early 1930s police and concerned citizens agreed 
something had to be done about the too live crew of gangster 
films 
the new york patrolmans benefit association passed a resolution 
calling for a ban on films that glorify the lives of gangsters 
gunmen and racketeers the better films committee of montclair 
nj blamed the death of a 12yearold boy on a gangster movie the 
murderer had seen 
the main culprits were little caesar and the public 
enemy no matter that stars edward g robinson and james cagney 
got theirs in the end who could possibly root for the coppers when 
the bad guys were played by better actors with better wardrobes 
hollywood tried cagney insisted he was sick of carrying guns 
and beating up women movies should be entertaining not 
bloodbaths and when scarface the shame of the nation was 
released in 1932 a grim warning was placed at the beginning of the 
film 
this picture is an indictment of gang rule in america and of 
thecallous indifference of the government to this increasing 
menace to our safety and our liberty what are you going to do 
about it 
but director howard hawks undermined the message the thugs 
stole the show none of the speechmaking by the films police 
commissioner was as effective as watching george raft coolly clip 
paper dolls or paul muni gun down fellow mobster boris karloff at a 
bowling alley a bullet knocking down the 10th pin 
being a gangster was better than being president of the united 
states ray liotta boasts as gangster henry hill in the current 
goodfellas munis tony camonte felt the same way as he stared 
outside his apartment at a neon sign that read the world is 
yours 
gangsters really werent that different from the old hollywood 
bosses they talked tough wore fancy clothes cut milliondollar 
deals they grew up poor and had little education but made it to 
the top through hard work ruthlessness and a strong belief in free 
enterprise 
death was inevitable taxes were not 
because they ennoble energy and because they are low born 
cocky and selfsufficient they demonstrate what one can 
accomplish against all the odds outside the traditions film 
critic neil gabler wrote in an empire of their own his book 
about hollywood 
current mob movies include millers crossing starring 
gabriel byrne as an irish mobster with conflicting loyalties 
state of grace another story about irish mobsters this one 
set in new yorks hells kitchen and starring sean penn gary 
oldman and ed harris and martin scorseses goodfellas 
the highly publicized the godfather part iii again 
directed by francis ford coppola is due in november the 
godfather released in 1972 won the academy award for best 
picture and the godfather part ii did the same two years later 
no one can really identify the first gangster film but dw 
griffiths musketeers of pig alley released in 1912 contained 
some of the classic elements a young couple trapped in a war 
between rival gangs a saloon a dance hall crooked cops and 
gunmen with nervous hands 
the gangsters and the making of crooks released during 
the next few years included such devices as a policeman working 
undercover a major part of the 1949 classic white heat and a 
pool hall where crooks and aspiring crooks gathered 
by the late 1920s all a hollywood producer had to do was pick 
up the newspaper to get inspiration torn from todays 
headlines was how one publicity department described the gangster 
films scarface for instance has a plot similar to the 
notorious st valentines day massacre 
al capone nicknamed scarface was feuding for control of 
chicagos bootlegging operations on the morning of feb 14 1929 
four men two dressed as police officers raided rival george 
bugs morans garage headquarters they lined up the men against 
a wall feigning a routine frisk but instead shattered their bodies 
with bullets 
more and more is the realization growing that pictures can and 
do play an allimportant part in the cultural and educational 
development of the world said jack warner the studio chief at 
warner bros which produced most of the gangster films 
i do not mean we should strive for socalled intellectual 
films but we should strive for pictures that provide something 
more than a mere idle hour or two of entertainment 
this was tabloid moviemaking 90 minutes or less of screaming 
headlines random violence and sex as gentle as a grapefruit in the 
kisser asked how camonte muni got the scar on his face an 
associate snapped in a war with a blonde in a brooklyn 
speakeasy 
darryl zanuck the young production chief at warners was the 
mastermind behind many of the best gangster films including 
little caesar and doorway to hell of cagneys character in 
the public enemy he boasted every other underworld picture 
has had a thug with a little bit of good in him he reforms before 
the fadeout this guy is no good at all itll go big 
warners churned out product like a machine gun spitting 
bullets films were often completed in less than three weeks with 
directors rushing from set to set and writers at times working on 
10 projects at the same time cagney once made six pictures in a 
span of 40 weeks 
some of hollywoods biggest stars began as tough guys and 
molls 
spencer tracy appeared in a series of gangster films notably 
quick millions when he was under contract to fox in the early 
1930s at mgm clark gable was a gangster in several films edging 
just slightly toward the right side of the law as he became more 
famous 
jean harlow had a supporting role in the public enemy bette 
davis appeared opposite tracy in 20000 years in sing sing and 
cagney in jimmy the gent and barbara stanwyck was no angel as 
the star of baby face 
but by 1933 the first run of gangster films was soon over in 
1933 the repeal of prohibition ended the bootlegging wars and the 
following year the hays offices production code called for the 
violence to be toned down and demanded a stop to all the passions 
that stimulate the baser emotions 
gangsters remained on the screen but soon the best films were 
often parodies a slight case of murder reflections on aging 
high sierra or chronicles of a time the roaring 
twenties when silver tongues and deadly bullets gave smalltime 
hustlers the chance to be big shots 
out of this mix of energy suspicion gloom iconoclasm and 
liberalism came not only a distinctive kind of film but also a 
distinctive vision of america particularly urban america 
gabler wrote 
it was a world where ones only hope and only meaning 
lay not in higher morals not in love not in family not in 
sacrifice but in action leavened by a sense of honor 
camonte with a reassuring pat to his coat pocket put it 
another way 
in this business theres only one law you gotta follow to 
keep out of trouble

president bush has decided to accept higher 
income tax rates on the wealthy in exchange for a deep cut in 
capital gains taxes as part of an overall deficit reduction 
package republican lawmakers said today 
rep bill archer rtexas a senior republican on the 
taxwriting house ways and means committee emerged from a white 
house meeting announcing that the president was ready to end two 
days of confusion over his position on taxes 
bush made his decision as lawmakers struggled against an oct 19 
deadline to come up with a 500 billion package of spending cuts 
and tax increases to get the deficit under control 
archer said bush will support raising the marginal tax rate on 
the wealthiest americans from 28 percent to 31 percent but only if 
congress lowers the capital gains rate to 15 percent capital gains 
profits from the sale of stocks real estate and other assets 
are currently taxed at the same rate as other income 
now even though the wealthiest taxpayers pay a 28 percent tax 
those making less can pay 33 percent 
archer said that the new proposal would seek to eliminate this 
apparent inequity

academys announcement awarding octavio paz the nobel prize in 
literature 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this year the nobel prize for literature goes to the mexican 
writer poet and essayist octavio paz honoring the writer of 
spanish with a wide international perspective 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for impassioned writing with wide horizons characterized by 
sensuous intelligence and humanistic integrity 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
paz published his first collection of poems while still in his 
teens today in his 76th year he remains active as a writer and a 
critic 
in a draft of shadows from 1975 there is a line which 
provides the key to much of pazs production seeing the world is 
spelling it his poetry consists in other words to a very great 
extent of writing both with and about words in pazs 
surrealistically inspired thought the words are endowed in this 
way with new changeable and richer meanings the power of the 
poetic vocation often asserted by brodsky walcott and others 
gives the words a form of otherwise unattainable content we 
never say the words of the poem the poem tells us from 
return 1969 in a poem to roman jakobson in 1976 he 
articulates his stance between what i see and what i say 
between what i say and what i keep silent between what i keep 
silent and what i dream between what i dream and what i forget 
poetry 
pazs poetry and essays evolve from an intractable but fruitful 
union of cultures precolumbian indian the spanish conquistadors 
and western modernism experiences from india and other areas are 
included as well all of this has in shifting configurations been 
reflected in his work his own identity mexican and in its 
broader meaning latin american has already been explored 
decisively in the labyrinth of solitude 1950 
the poet himself embodies this union of cultures it is in his 
blood his mothers family was spanish from andalusia on his 
fathers side the indian and the spanish are combined 
one of the high points of pazs poetry is the long poem sun 
stone 1957 this was inspired by a magnificent calendar stone 
which still stands as an heirloom from the aztecs whose calendar 
was based on the conjunctions of venus and the sun the 584 days of 
this cycle are matched by the 584 lines of the poem this 
suggestive work with its many layers of meaning seems to 
incorporate interpret and reconstrue major existential questions 
death time love and reality 
as a publisher of magazines vuelta return being the 
latest paz has been a lodestar in the tide of opinion others have 
quite simply been obliged to state their position in relation to 
his he has pursued his humanistic course with unique integrity 
which is also recorded in the prize citation 
in his book sor juana or the traps of faith 1982 he 
applies literary history and the history of ideas in depicting 
juana ines de la cruz a remarkable 17th century woman this 
erudite poet and dramatist a ladyinwaiting who later became a 
nun is the subject of a penetrating analysis against the 
background of the culture and society of her day the work takes 
the form of a portrait one which bears the signature of a great 
humanist 
paz has written exquisite love poetry at the same time sensuous 
and visual woman fountain in the night i am bound to her 
quiet flowing in his latest collection of poems a tree 
within 1987 we are confronted with a series of reflections on 
death paz turns inwards on himself in a new way 
paz is a poet and essayist his poetry with one of its points 
of departure in surrealism which however he has developed and 
broadened under the influence of precolumbian culture and the 
buddhist philosophy of india and japan can be found apart from 
his first volume from 1933 in the poemas 19351975 1981 and 
the bilingual collected poems 19571987 1987 
his collections of essays amounting to about 30 deal to a 
great extent with social subjects not the least important of these 
are of course mexican history and culture together with art and 
literature in particular the essence and diction of poetry

foreign secretary douglas hurd said 
today that iraq must be told that force will be used unless 
president saddam hussein withdraws from kuwait 
day by day we must build in the minds of the iraqis the 
certainty that they have to leave kuwait if not peacefully then 
forced out by military action hurd said 
he spoke during the annual conference of the governing 
conservative party 
hurd warned that the world will revert to anarchy if the 
international coalition against iraq collapses 
if it does not hold then despite the coalition despite the 
leadership of the united states despite the cooperation of the 
soviet union then we shall be back in a world of anarchy 
punctuated by explosions of force 
the clouds would have extinguished the light we cannot allow 
this to happen he said 
hurd made only passing reference to the killing this week by 
israelis of 19 arabs at a riot in jerusalem and said that ending 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait must take precedence over attempts 
to solve the arabisraeli conflict 
hurd addressed the conference as britain battled in the un 
security council in new york to find a means of censuring israel 
that goes far enough for outraged arab nations but that the united 
states will also accept 
earlier chancellor of the exchequer john major pledged that 
britain will fight plans for european economic union despite the 
linking the pound this week to other european community currencies 
major in his keynote address to the conference also promised 
britains 106 percent inflation rate the major failure of 11 
years of conservative rule will fall sharply next year 
joining the exchange rate mechanism does not mean that we are 
now on a road leading inexorably to a single currency he said to 
cheers from the 5000 delegates 
the chancellor reiterated that britain still will not accept a 
radical plan for a single currency and central banking system for 
the 12nation european economic community

police fired tear gas in jerusalems old city 
today to break up a march by about 150 palestinians to the temple 
mount where 19 arabs were killed by police gunfire earlier this 
week 
world listen to us we are people who will never submit 
the marchers chanted before being blocked from entering the mount 
by riot police armed with machine guns 
meanwhile several hundred arabs who had entered the mount 
earlier in the day marched around the dome of the rock mosque 
carrying outlawed palestinian flags they chanted the moslem battle 
cry allahu akbar or god is great and we will redeem 
our martyrs 
one of the flags was draped over a symbolic coffin 
israeli police guarding the gates to the mount watched the 
demonstration but did not intervene 
another protest against the killings was held at the church of 
the holy sepulchre where 70 palestinians many of them women 
dressed in black staged a sitdown strike 
christian leaders marched from the church to the temple mount to 
join moslem clerics in prayer they included samir kafity the 
anglican bishop of jerusalem and lutfi laham the greek catholic 
patriarch 
todays demonstrations were the latest in a series of protests 
following the clash monday on the mount the third holiest site in 
islam 
arab hospitals in the occupied west bank and gaza strip said at 
least 14 palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers in 
scattered clashes wednesday 
more than a million palestinians remained under army curfews in 
the occupied territories confined to their homes under army 
orders 
the underground leadership of the nearly 3yearold palestinian 
uprising had urged gaza residents to violate the curfews starting 
today 
but residents said few people came out of their homes after army 
units drove through gaza towns early today warning through 
loudspeakers that anybody who defies the curfew will be severely 
punished 
mondays rioting at the temple mount began when palestinians 
threw stones at jewish worshipers at the adjacent western wall the 
stoning was apparently triggered by rumors jewish zealots were 
going to march to the moslemcontrolled mount to reclaim it for 
judaism 
about 30 worshipers and police were injured by the stones and 
police then charged onto the temple mount first firing tear gas 
and then live ammunition 
the rioting in which 140 arabs were wounded was the bloodiest 
of the palestinian uprising against israeli occupation that began 
in december 1987 
in the uprising at least 758 palestinians have been slain by 
israelis and another 278 arabs have been killed by other arabs as 
alleged collaborators with the enemy fiftytwo israelis and 
foreigners have also died in the violence 
moslems venerate the temple mount as haram essharif or the 
noble enclosure and believe it is where the prophet mohammed 
ascended to heaven its two mosques dating to the 7th and 8th 
centuries are islams third holiest site 
the western wall also known as the wailing wall is the last 
remnant of the ancient jewish temple destroyed by the romans in the 
year 70 it is judaisms holiest place

iranian moderates allied with president 
hashemi rafsanjanis government on thursday won nearly all seats on 
a constitutional body in elections in which many of their radical 
opponents were excluded 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
said only 18 million people voted in tehran the iranian capital 
which has a population of more than 10 million 
this confirmed earlier reports from diplomatic sources in tehran 
that mondays poll was largely boycotted despite government 
exhortations urging all iranians over 15 to vote 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists was among 
the key members elected to the 83member assembly of experts whose 
main task is to elect the nations spiritual leader and interpret 
the constitution 
among others elected to the 15 seats contested in tehran were 
ahmad khomeini son of the late revolutionary leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini mohammad reyshahri the former 
prosecutorgeneral and ayatollah ali meshkini who headed the last 
assembly 
the three are among only a handful of rafsanjanis radical 
rivals whose names were allowed on the ballot as part of the 
presidents campaign to squeeze the hardliners out of key power 
centers 
most of the radicals were prevented from running after the 
government said they had had to sit a test on their islamic 
credentials in an apparent effort by ayatollah ali khamenei the 
current spiritual leader and rafsanjani to reduce the radicals 
influence 
most of the radicals who agreed to take the examamination 
flunked 
before the 12member council of guardians decreed the new rule 
candidates for the assembly were approved by three senior clerics 
in the holy city of qom 
the conflict over the balloting has heightened tension between 
th rival factions and brought the longrunning power struggle in 
tehrans hierarchy more prominently into the open 
since the death of khomeini in june 1989 the antiwestern 
radicals have feared a purge by rafsanjani 
he is seeking to rebuild bridges with the west and attract 
investment to revive the sluggish economy devastated by the 198088 
war with iraq his opponents say close ties with the west are 
contrary to khomeinis teachings 
the radicals who constitute a majority in the 270member 
parliament have accused khamenei rafsanjanis political ally of 
colluding with him in rigging the elections 
the voting was conducted amid tight security after the radicals 
had threatened to stage protests diplomatic sources in tehran 
said but no incidents were reported 
in an apparent move to appease the radicals khamenei on 
thursday called on mosques throughout the nation to mourn the 
slaying of 19 palestinians by israeli forces in jerusalem monday 
the killings have particularly enraged the radicals who 
consider israel and the united states the greatest enemies of 
islam they have repeatedly pledged to destroy israel and 
humilate the great satan its closest ally 
the majlis or parliament wednesday called for a jihad or holy 
war to liberate the palestinian homeland 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said rafsanjani declared 
friday a national day of mourning

in the foyer of a new york theater where the 
world chess championship opened this week 100 exotic chess sets 
shine inside a row of illuminated cases 
half belong to david hafler a suburban philadelphia man whose 
collection has been called among the finest in the world 
collected over 30 years haflers 230 sets from 40 countries 
feature figures of jade porcelain glass ivory wood gold 
silver and a variety of semiprecious stones 
theres an aesthetic value in the sets themselves and in the 
art related to it said hafler most people dont realize what 
variety there is and what beauty is available its something that 
can be appreciated even by people who dont play chess 
the first 12 games between world champion garri kasparov and his 
challenger anatoly karpov are being played at the hudson theater in 
new york kasparov won the second game wednesday night the first 
game ended in a draw 
the match will move to lyon france for the concluding 12 games 
of a 10week faceoff 
the collection will not move with the competition 
hafler 71 began collecting sets in 1960 after he bought a set 
for a friends son at a new york department store he returned 
later with his wife gertrude to buy a set for himself 
gert looked up and said lets get this one too he said 
i said we dont need another set she said well you like 
that one i like this one so we got another set and that was the 
start once you get more than one of something that you dont 
really need youve become a collector he said 
hafler later asked us embassies to help him locate dealers 
the designer of specialized audio equipment also scheduled overseas 
business trips to coincide with auctions 
haflers oldest complete set is a 15th or 16thcentury french 
set of topaz and crystal 
he has a faberge original a set napoleon supposedly presented 
to one of his generals and an amber set once owned by russian 
empress catherine the great 
a soviet set made in the 1930s features capitalist pawns in 
chains 
haflers collection is reputedly the best in the world said 
larry parr a former editor of the us magazine chess life and 
review it is certainly first among equals 
the 50 other sets on display in new york belong to george dean 
a doctor from birmingham mich who formed chess collectors 
international in 1984 
although hafler occasionally plays chess he said few collectors 
do in fact some of them dont even know how to set up the 
pieces

a state judge today threw an ethics 
initiative off missouris nov 6 ballot ruling that several parts 
of it were unconstitutional 
cole county circuit judge james f mchenry said the measure 
wrongly dealt with too many subjects and that its ballot title was 
insufficient 
mchenry said the initiative amendment 5 is not in compliance 
with the procedural requirements of the constitution of missouri 
and it is therefore not to be printed on the ballot 
amendment 5 placed on the ballot through a petition campaign 
would create a state ethics commission and force big changes in the 
legislature including reducing the size of the 163member house to 
103 by 2003 
state attorney general william webster said he would appeal 
mchenrys ruling to the missouri supreme court 
willard reine president of missourians to protect the 
initiative process which legally challenged the measure said 
im very pleased i think the judge interpreted the law right 
the initiative process is important to have but its got to be 
done right

the white house said today president bush 
would accept higher taxes on the wealthiest americans in a trade 
for a deep cut in capital gains rates 
bushs decision was disclosed after two days of confusion over 
his position on taxes and came as congress struggled to cement a 
500 billion deficit reduction package of tax increases and 
spending cuts 
rep william archer rtexas said that under the plan the top 
income tax rate would be raised for about 500000 of the nations 
wealthiest taxpayers the rate would be lowered for about 45 
million who earn slightly less he said the tax on capital gains 
would be cut for all who make profits on the sale of stocks real 
estate and other investments 
bushs new tax policy faced an uncertain reception in congress 
where many republicans philosophically oppose any increase in tax 
rates and some democrats are reluctant cut the capital gains tax 
there was no immediate reaction from democratic leaders 
but within an hour of bushs decision being made public the 
white house sought to lower expectations for such a deal and 
suggest that the democrats would never go along 
richard darman white house budget director said republicans 
had proposed a hike in tax rates for the wealthy during budget 
negotiations last month but said it was rejected by the democrats 
under the proposal the the marginal tax rate on the wealthiest 
americans would be raised from 28 percent to 31 percent but only 
if congress lowers the capital gains rate to 15 percent 
capital gains profits from the sale of stocks real estate and 
other assets are currently taxed at the same rate as other 
income 
the white house statement said that bush had authorized his 
budget negotiators to explore such an option more than a month ago 
even though today was the first time it has surfaced publically 
the statement said that while bush still supported the plan he 
was afraid that its formal presentation at this time could actually 
lead to democratic action to raise the top tax rates to 33 percent 
i will not tolerate raising rates to 33 percent bush 
was quoted by fitzwater as saying i cannot accept that 
the statement said that the plan for a 31 percent top rate was 
originally opposed not only by democrats but also by some of the 
same republicans who now favor it 
archer said roughly 500000 people will get a rate increase 
under the proposal those will be at the very highest income 
levels he said 
archer said about 45 million people would get a rate reduction 
under the proposal presumably those now paying a 33 percent rate 
the plan would bring a relatively modest 6 billion in increased 
tax revenues to the treasury over five years archer said 
participants at the morning meeting said the new proposal would 
in essence do away with the current 33 percent top rate now paid 
by upper middleclass taxpayers 
in essence gop lawmakers said bushs proposal would flatten 
out the socalled bubble in the tax code the anomaly under 
which tax rates on additional income are now lower for the 
wealthiest americans than they are for some who are less wealthy 
instead there would be three distinct tax brackets the 15 
percent bracket for lowerincome americans would remain then 
above a certain income level the taxes for additional income would 
jump to 28 percent and finally move to 31 percent 
bush earlier in the week had indicated that he was open to a 
compromise trading higher taxes on the wealthy for a lower 
capitalgains rate however he then appeared to back away under 
pressure from gop senators 
the confusion created by bushs apparent wavering on the issue 
slowed down congressional consideration of a budget compromise and 
led democratic leaders to accuse bush of indecision 
he said without equivocation this is what we wanted to do 
archer said in comments echoed by other republicans who attended 
the morning meeting 
house republican leader bob michel rill said that bush was 
inflexible on the new 31 percent rate as i understand it as 
of this morning 
michel said the president wanted to clearly stake out where 
he was on that issue 
earlier senate leaders reported progress in efforts to agree on 
a deficitreduction plan after the house ways and means committee 
approved a 144 billion bill to raise taxes on gasoline tobacco 
alcohol and the earnings of higherincome americans 
what we are trying to do is see if we can develop a 
comprehensive package that is acceptable to a majority of 
democratic and republican members senate majority leader george 
j mitchell dmaine told reporters 
we believe we have made progress he said after meeting with 
republican leader bob dole of kansas and leaders of the finance 
committee 
the house bill approved by the ways and means committee bill 
eliminates a proposed tax on heating oil lessens an increase in 
the tax on gasoline drops 12 billion in tax incentives for 
investors in small corporations and reduces the proposed increase 
in premiums that retirees pay for medicare coverage of doctors 
bills 
the medicare premium now 2860 a month would rise gradually 
to 4650 the annual 75 deductible that beneficiaries pay for 
hospital care before medicare starts paying would be raised to 100 
next year and to 125 in 1992 
overall the new plan would mean a 24 percent tax increase on 
people with incomes of 200000 or more compared with 17 percent 
in the earlier version for those with incomes from 30000 to 
40000 the new plan would raise taxes by 3 percent compared with 
29 percent in the earlier plan 
people with incomes under 10000 would face a 69 percent 
overall tax increase under the ways and means bill down from 76 
percent in the earlier bill

a juror began shouting in open court today at 
the father of murder victim yusuf hawkins interrupting 
deliberations in the trial of a white man charged in the black 
teenagers death 
the defense moved for a mistrial based on the jurors 
profanitylaced antagonism but justice thaddeus owens ruled that 
the proceedings would go on 
the exchange occurred shortly before noon as the jury sat in the 
courtroom listening to a reading of testimony by the defendant 
charles stressler he is one of several whites charged in hawkins 
august 1989 death in the bensonhurst section of brooklyn 
hawkins father moses stewart watched from the spectator 
seats 
suddenly one of the jurors lydia bermudez yelled at stewart 
youve been doing that to me every day you know what im talking 
about youve been doing it every day 
the juror did not say what she meant but stewart said later he 
took her to be objecting to being looked at 
if she cant stand the father of the victim looking at her 
get her out of here he said i look at everybody on the 
jury i dont care who she is i look at everybody on the jury 
after the outburst owens called the juror and lawyers to 
chambers where stresslers lawyer jacob b evseroff moved for 
dismissal of the indictment mistrial or stewarts exclusion from 
the courtroom 
owens denied all three motions 
bermudez had indicated to the judge that she felt intimidated by 
stewart and asserted i dont need this aggravation from this 
freaking lowlife 
the jury received the case wednesday evening after hearing the 
defense argue that stressler 22 was little more than a bystander 
while prosecutors said he waqs guilty of murder for acting in 
concert with other members of the white mob 
in earlier trials joey fama 19 was convicted of murdering 
hawkins and keith mondello also 19 was acquitted of murder and 
manslaughter but was convicted on several lesser charges 
john vento was convicted of menacing and unlawful imprisonment 
his jury deadlocked on murder and riot counts and he is awaiting 
retrial 
four other young white men will be tried later for their alleged 
roles in the attack

the white house said today president bush 
would accept higher taxes on the wealthiest americans in exchange 
for a deep cut in capital gains rates but prefers a 
deficitcutting agreement that omits both elements 
caught in another day of budget confusion bush said he would 
not pursue the tax trade in negotiations with the house and senate 
over a package of spending cuts and tax increases totalling 500 
billion over five years 
i think its a waste of time because i just dont think it can 
get through both houses of congress bush said of the proposal 
there was no immediate reaction from congressional democrats 
the developments seemed to complicate efforts to draft the 
budget accord before oct 19 when the government faces the 
prospect of a shutdown in nonessential services 
bush held a morning session at the white house with gop 
lawmakers 
rep bill archer rtexas emerging from the meeting suggested 
bush had decided on a strategy of seeking a package of capital 
gains tax cuts combined with a modest boost in income tax rates for 
the wealthy bush had floated that very idea at a news conference 
tuesday but then appeared to back away under pressure from 
republican senators 
today archer said bush expressed unequivocal support for the 
package again but then the white house made clear that the plan 
touted by archer was not the one that bush would pursue 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush recognizes 
that he cannot get a good deal from congress on capital gains and 
income taxes he said bush would prefer a budget package that omits 
both elements 
fitzwater offered a candid explanation for the confusion of the 
past two days one of the phenomenons of group meetings between 
the president and lawmakers is people hear what they want to 
hear 
the press spokesman apologized for letting confusion reign for 
the past two days i think we just made a mistake in not 
clearing things up 
under the plan advocated by archer the top income tax rate 
would be raised for about 500000 of the nations wealthiest 
taxpayers the rate would be lowered for about 45 million who earn 
slightly less he said the tax on capital gains would be cut for 
all who make profits on the sale of stocks real estate and other 
investments

the momandpop stores that dot this 
rural state are fighting a ballot measure abolishing maines tough 
blue laws which force most big retailers to close on sundays 
while most states allow local communities the option to restrict 
sunday business maine and north dakota are the only two with 
statewide blue laws maine outlaws sunday shopping at all but small 
retailers but exempts sporting goods stores most notably ll 
bean inc which is open 24 hours seven days a week 
on nov 6 voters in maine will decide whether to revoke the 
28yearold state blue law and grant themselves the right to shop 
anywhere they want seven days a week 
supporters led by citizens for choice on sunday a political 
action group backed by large retailers contend the blue law 
restricts business competition 
the retail federation of maine a coalition of large stores 
began campaigning to change the law several years ago it collected 
enough signatures last year to force the referendum in november 
the leading opposition group save our sundays representing 
mostly momandpop stores argues that abolishing the law would 
disrupt family life force some parents to work on sundays and 
drive many small businesses into bankruptcy 
hugh holmes the owner of maine pride markets in farmingdale 
says he does 25 percent of his business on sundays 
were a really small grocery store and sunday is a really big 
thing for us holmes said when the major stores are closed 
its very important to us because we do a lot of volume 
craig burgess owner of burgess market in bath says abolishing 
the blue law would be very detrimental to his business 
i think the small independent grocers are kind of a dying 
breed and i dont want to be part of that trend burgess said 
the fact is our way of life is going to change said robert 
reny sr a leading opponent and president and chief executive 
officer of the maine department store chain of rh reny and co 
its going to be dog eat dog seven days a week 
but aretas stearns president of porteous mitchell amp braun co 
department stores and a competitor of renys said that the 
quality of life issue thats being raised by the opposition is a 
smokescreen i think givingpeople a choice enhances their quality 
of life 
stearns and officials from other large companies contend the 
current law unfairly prohibits most retail stores with more than 
5000 square feet of floor space from opening on sundays except for 
the period between thanksgiving and christmas when they may open 
from noon until 5 pm 
stearns says exemptions such as the one allowing ll bean to 
operate on sundays illustrate the inequity of the law 
this thing is a patchwork of selfinterested restrictions that 
serve to keep about 12 major chains closed on sundays and restricts 
consumers ability to shop when they want to stearns says it 
is absolutely driven by selfinterest on the part of some merchants 
who have a monopoly on sunday sales

the soviet unions most advanced booster rocket 
which an american specialist believed was carrying a spy satellite 
exploded seconds after liftoff last week 
the blast nearly destroyed the launch pad and may complicate 
soviet efforts to sell space hardware to the west 
the official soviet news agency tass reported for the first time 
thursday that a zenit booster broke up at the baikonur space 
port in the central asian republic of kazakhstan on oct 4 
tass said no one was hurt and that a commission is investigating 
the accident the threesentence dispatch did not identify the 
payload or give any other details it also did not say why the 
explosion was not reported for a week 
james oberg an american aerospace engineer and expert on the 
soviet space program said he believes the payload was a satellite 
the soviet military hoped to use for electronic intelligence 
gathering 
a spokesman for the soviet space agency glavkosmos told the 
associated press one of two launch pads the zenit uses was nearly 
totally destroyed and that the satellite was ruined 
nikolai semyonov head of glavkosmos international department 
did not say how the satellite which he said was in the kosmos 
series was to be used 
he said further zenit launches have been put on hold 
i dont think any new launching will be attempted until the 
reasons for the accident are properly analyzed and the destroyed 
pad is restored semyonov said in a telephone interview 
he said the rocket exploded in the air right over the pad 
but that no one was hurt because the launch was highly automated 
vladimir utkin chief designer of the yuzhnoye plant that builds 
zenit told the red army newspaper red star in august that no 
people are on the launch pad for zenit blastoffs 
the soviet space program has suffered several setbacks in the 
past two years including the loss of two mars probes malfunction 
of an exit hatch on the orbiting manned station mir and equipment 
problems that plagued the landings of several cosmonaut crews 
the program recently has been faced with spending cuts and close 
scrutiny by legislators trying to trim a budget deficit 
last weeks explosion comes as the soviets biggest space 
competitor the united states tries to correct problems that have 
delayed launches of us space shuttles and marred the performance 
of the hubble space telescope 
soviet space officials have been trying to make up for spending 
cuts by wooing foreign customers for their launch services and the 
zenit rocket was their showcase to the west they face stiff 
competition from the americans and europeans who are also offering 
launch services and satellites 
president bush opened the way in august for a us company to 
help build a space port in australia to launch zenit rockets the 
soviets want to supply 308 million worth of rockets and technology 
over the next 10 years for launches of americanbuilt satellites at 
the new center 
oberg said the zenit contained the soviet unions most advanced 
propulsion system and was its showcase rocket for luring 
foreign customers 
they were counting on it to make some money this is a blow to 
their space commercialization effort but one that theyll probably 
overcome oberg said in a telephone interview from his home in 
galveston county texas 
the soviets rarely report accidents involving military space 
payloads oberg who has written a book on soviet space disasters 
said he believes disclosure of last weeks explosion was prompted 
by commercial considerations 
if its realized theyre telling the truth on it theyll 
probably emerge stronger continuing to earn the trust of customers 
by being straight with them oberg said 
he noted that the french are continuing to sell the services of 
their ariane rocket booster and the americans continue to peddle 
their centaur and delta rockets despite explosions 
semyonov also attempted to minimize longrange implications of 
the explosion 
of course the consequences are heavy but we shouldnt 
overdramatize it such accidents do happen from time to time 
everywhere else in the world including in the usa japan and other 
countries he said 
according to oberg the soviets usually claim kosmos satellites 
are for scientific research but that the term is a camouflage 
for military use 
last weeks explosion is the first of a zenit rocket which went 
into service in mid1985 and was last launched in may it burns a 
keroseneoxygen mixture in a highpressure engine and can carry a 
12ton payload

federal regulators thursday proposed a 
finderskeepers licensing system to encourage business radio users 
to ferret out underutilized or vacant channels on the nations 
crowded airwaves 
those who locate such channels in the private land mobile 
radio services would be rewarded with a license to the channels 
as long as the finders meet minimum eligibility requirements and 
provided that the channels could be utilized on an exclusive 
rather than shared basis the federal communications commission 
said 
the commission also proposed to speed the reassignment of unused 
or underused channels in private land mobile whose users include 
public safety and government agencies doctors hospitals public 
utilities railroads and taxicabs it does not include cellular or 
broadcast radio 
taxicab companies since they share channels would not be 
affected by the finders preference proposal 
the commission in voting 50 to consider the proposals said 
private land mobile frequencies have become congested and 
extremely scarce in many areas making it difficult for new 
applicants to obtain licenses and for existing licensees to expand 
their systems 
in other action the fcc voted 50 to 
give more channels increased power and streamlined licensing 
procedures to the wireless microwave cable tv systems that 
provide cable programming to apartment buildings and remote areas 
not served by wired cable the wireless systems would be able to 
lease some unused instructional tv channels 
define cable systems as those using only cable wire or other 
physically closed or shielded transmission paths to provide service 
to subscribers the definition effectively excludes wireless cable 
and direct broadcast satellite systems from having to obtain 
licenses from local authorities and could be important if and when 
congress decides to reregulate cable system prices and business 
procedures 
consider changing international maritime distress 
communications equipment from morse code and manual operations to 
automated or semiautomated communications systems using satellite 
and digital technologies the proposals would affect all ships over 
300 gross tons moving internationally or passenger ships carrying 
12 or more passengers it would not affect fishing and recreational 
yachts 
the finders preference system was proposed by the business 
radio industry and would replace the existing system that awards 
unused or underused channels on a firstcome firstserve basis 
through private industry groups that coordinate frequency 
allocation 
ralph haller chief of the fccs private radio bureau said he 
did not think the new system would encourage bounty hunters who 
would try to gain licenses to unused channels and then auction them 
off to the highest bidder 
the commission said it would closely monitor for any signs of 
abuse and was seeking comment on whether applicants seeking 
preference should first certify that they have not compensated the 
previous licensee 
the commission also proposed to streamline private mobile 
licensing procedures and to cancel licenses automatically one year 
after such a licensee discontinues operations 
haller said some discontinued radio operations can go unnoticed 
for as long as five years until license renewal time

a congressional report warns that shuttle 
flights and other space activity could become too risky within the 
next 2030 years if nations continue to litter the most traveled 
paths 
already the hubble space telescope which has enough problems 
of its own because of faulty optics has been given a onein100 
chance of being severely damaged by space debris during its 17year 
lifetime said the office of technology assessment 
even small debris particles can produce high levels of 
damage said ray williamson who directed the study the 
average collision velocity in low earth orbit is about 10 
kilometers 62 miles a second 
at such speed an object having onethirtyfifth the weight of 
an aspirin tablet would have the impact of a 3006 bullet he said 
nasa is incorporating shielding for critical elements as it 
designs the space station and is looking into possible collision 
avoidance maneuvers for the shuttle according to the ota report 
don kessler nasas debris expert at the johnson space center in 
houston said the agency is warned about once every shuttle mission 
by air force trackers that objects are in the path about once 
every five missions he said when the object is in an approaching 
box a mile high a mile wide and three miles long nasa is 
advised to change course slightly 
such a maneuver has never been made he said because even 
within that box the chances of a collision are estimated at one in 
100000 
in the only documented collision a tiny paint chip damaged the 
windshield of space shuttle challenger in 1983 to the extent that 
it had to be replaced that chip would have punctured the 
pressurized suit of a spacewalking astronaut had it struck him ota 
said 
as of last week the us space command was tracking 6645 
artificial objects orbiting earth each larger than a softball and 
weighing a total of about 45 million pounds only six percent were 
operating satellites the rest was debris and some experts think 
there may be another 30000 to 70000 bits of junk too small to 
track 
half the debris comes from rockets that drift in orbit after 
boosting their spacecraft above the atmosphere other debris comes 
from satellites particulates from solid rocket motors and paint 
chips that have flaked off 
as you increase levels of space activity unless we do 
something to reduce the generation of debris it will increase 
williamson told a news conference he said estimates are the junk 
will increase by 240 pieces a year or more as space activities are 
stepped up 
that debris can collide with both active and inactive 
satellites damaging the active satellites and maybe rendering them 
inoperative and producing more debris from both types 
williamson said 
debris also is becoming a problem at the 22300mile altitude 
where communications satellites operate 
the report said international action will be needed to minimize 
production of new debris and to cope with that already in orbit 
it suggested boosters and spacecraft could be designed not to 
explode or break up batteries could be protected from explosion 
and spent upper stages of rockets could be removed by reducing 
their altitude so atmospheric drag will bring them down 
although the ota study doesnt mention it nature is helping 
remove space debris an increase in solar activity has resulted in 
the expansion of the atmosphere which in turn slows lowflying 
objects and forces them to fall to earth burning up in the 
process not long ago the space command was tracking 7200 
objects 
the japanese and european space agencies are doing their share 
to reduce debris and ota said discussions with the soviets have 
proven fruitful 
in the past the soviet union made it a practice to fragment 
certain reconnaissance satellites after their useful life 
presumably to prevent them from being recovered by the united 
states recently they have exploded these satellites in low orbits 
so that the debris quickly enters earths atmosphere

octavio paz who explored the mexican 
character and the universal themes of love death and loneliness in 
lyrical poetry and impassioned essays won the nobel prize in 
literature thursday 
the swedish academy awarded paz the prize for his exquisite 
love poetry at the same time sensuous and visual and for his 
wide international perspective 
it also cited paz for his essays on mexican society calling him 
a lodestar in the tide of opinion pazs views have angered the 
left and the right in his homeland and he was dumped by leftists 
who felt he turned on their cause 
paz 76 said he was very very surprised at being selected 
poetry is not a very popular art form these days but its an 
essential part of human life paz said in new york where he is 
inaugurating a mexican art exhibit at the metropolitan museum of 
art poetry is the memory of a country of language 
the prize is a sign that the spanish and latin american 
literature is in good health he added 
paz is the fifth nobel laureate from latin america the last 
previous was gabriel garcia marquez of colombia in 1982 
its also a great triumph for the glorious spanish language 
said 1989 laureate camilo jose cela of spain cela spoke in madrid 
peruvian writer mario vargas llosa one of latin americas 
leading authors said in washington octavio is one of the 
greatest poets that the spanishlanguage world has produced and at 
the same time a great humanist 
but swedish academy spokesman sture allen said the prize was 
meant to honor writers not a language 
the academy pointedly praised pazs wide international 
perspective gained during a 25year diplomatic career 
pazs poetry and essays evolve from an intractable but 
fruitful union of cultures precolumbian indian the spanish 
conquistadors and western modernism the academy said 
the academy said one of the high points of his work was the 1957 
poem sun stone which was inspired by a huge aztec calendar 
stone this suggestive work with its many layers of meaning seems 
to incorporate interpet and reconstrue major existential 
questions death time love and reality the academy said 
in a swedish radio interview paz recommended his essay the 
labyrinth of solitude and his poetry to those who have not read 
his work 
the academy said pazs own identity mexican and in its 
broader meaning latin american has been explored decisively in 
labyrinth 
the essay deeply affected how mexican society was viewed at home 
and abroad and was denounced by the left and the right 
the academy said paz himself embodies a union of cultures it 
is in his blood his mothers family was spanish from andalusia 
on his fathers side the indian and the spanish are combined 
he was born march 31 1914 and thanks to his grandfathers 
extensive library paz developed a love for literature at an early 
age he earned a law degree and entered the diplomatic service 
but he resigned as ambassador to india in 1968 and ended his 
diplomatic career when the mexican army fired on antigovernment 
student protesters killing at least 300 
he considers himself a socialist and a democrat but has been 
ostracized for criticizing the left 
i think that if there is one profoundly reactionary sector in 
latin america it is the leftist intellectual he said in an 
interview in 1979 they are people without memory i have never 
heard any one of them admit he made a mistake 
paz has many times criticized mexicos governing party for six 
decades the institutional revolutionary party 
but mexican president carlos salinas de gortari said thursday 
he is a poet and writer of whom we mexicans feel proud he has a 
universal stature 
the academy said pazs openmindedness allowed him to remain a 
strong influence on contemporary literature he still publishes the 
journal vuelta or return which he founded in 1976 
he received an honorary doctorate in 1980 from harvard 
university where he lectures 
paz won the most important award in the spanishspeaking world 
the cervantes prize in 1981 and the american neustadt prize in 
1982 
pazs swedish publisher adam bromberg said the author had been 
on the academys short list of top literature candidates for 15 
years 
others said to be in the running included chinese poet bei dao 
irish poet seamus heaney american novelist joyce carol oates 
brazilian novelist jorge amado novelist margaret atwood of canada 
south african author nadine gordimer and japanese novelist masuji 
ibuse 
the prize worth about 700000 is one of five awarded in 
october under terms of the will of alfred nobel the swedish 
inventor of dynamite who died in 1896 
two american doctors who pioneered human organ cell and bone 
marrow transplants joseph e murray 71 and e donnall thomas 
70 won the nobel prize in medicine monday 
the nobel peace prize will be awarded next monday in oslo 
norway the nobel prizes in chemistry and physics will be awarded 
in stockholm on oct 17 
the nobel memorial prize in economic science established by the 
central bank of sweden in 1969 will be awarded oct 16

the following are excerpts from the poem sun stone by 
octavio paz who won the nobel prize for literature on thursday it 
is followed by a short poem in its entirety with eyes closed 
the poems are included in selected poems published by new 
directions books in 1984 
 
sun stone 
 
willow of crystal a poplar of water 
a pillar of fountain by the wind drawn over 
tree that is firmly rooted and that dances 
turning course of a river that goes curving 
advances and retreats goes roundabout 
arriving forever 
the calm course of a star 
or the spring appearing without urgency 
water behind a stillness of closed eyelids 
flowing all night and pouring out prophecies 
a single presence in the procession of waves 
wave over wave until all is overlapped 
in a green sovereignty without decline 
a bright hallucination of many wings 
when they all open at the height of the sky 
the sun has forced an entrance through my forehead 
has opened my eyelids at last that were kept closed 
unfastened my being of its swaddling clothes 
has rooted me out of my self and separated 
me from my animal sleep centuries of stone 
and the magic of reflections resurrects 
willow of crystal a poplar of water 
a pillar of fountain by the wind drawn over 
tree that is firmly rooted and that dances 
turning course of a river that goes curving 
advances and retreats goes roundabout 
arriving forever 
 
 
 
with eyes closed 
 
with eyes closed 
you light up within 
you are blind stone 
 
night after night i carve you 
with eyes closed 
you are frank stone 
 
we have become enormous 
just knowing each other 
with eyes closed

an israeli army patrol on thursday was shot at 
from across the jordanian border and returned fire the army said 
there were no reports of injuries 
the soldiers were riding in a jeep along the border fence near 
the town of ashdod yaacov about six miles south of the sea of 
galilee when they heard shots said an army official on condition 
of anonymity 
the patrol returned fire and then searched the area but 
nothing was found the official said it looks like the 
jordanians also conducted searches 
israel and jordan although officially in a state of war have a 
tacit agreement to keep their joint border quiet 
jordan tries to block guerrilla infiltration attempts into 
israel and earlier this year returned unharmed two israeli 
teenagers who sneaked across the frontier as part of a dare 
earlier in the year however there were several incidents of 
jordanian soldiers crossing the border and firing on israeli 
patrols

a private consumer group charged thursday that 
electric utilities are underestimating the cost of shutting down 
nuclear power plants and could force taxpayers into another 
multibillion bailout in the years to come 
the charge immediately was denounced by the electric utility 
industry whose spokesmen said adequate funds for the shutdown or 
decommissioning of atomic power plants are being established 
under the scrutiny of both the nuclear regulatory commission and 
state regulators 
but a report by public citizen a washingtonbased consumer and 
environmental group alleged that industry estimates of how much it 
will cost to close plants is far too low and that federal and state 
officials have been lax in requiring adequate shutdown funds 
we could find ourselves in a situation of having another 
massive bailout said joan claybrook president of public 
citizen tomorrows electric users are going to pay 
under federal regulations atomic power plants are considered to 
have a life expectancy of 30 years after which many of them likely 
will have to be closed and decontaminated there has never been a 
decommissioning of a major operating atomic power plant because 
none is that old 
the nuclear industry as well as utilities and environmentalists 
agree that there are many uncertainties in trying to determine how 
much such shutdowns will cost 
the report by public citizen said that industry estimates of 
256 billion for shutting and decontaminating 124 plants is based 
on too many optimistic assumptions and that the total more likely 
will be between 50 billion and 100 billion 
for some reactors the cost to decommission the plants will 
rival their initial construction costs ms claybrook said at a 
news conference 
but industry spokesmen disavowed even the 256 billion figure 
much less the 100 billion estimate suggested by public citizen as 
an upper range ive never heard of this figure i dont know 
where they got this said ronald clements of the edison electric 
institute 
he said that by law utilities must establish segregated trust 
funds for the eventual shutdown of atomic power plants but actual 
estimates of shutdown costs can only be made incrementally as 
plants become older he said you dont want to overcollect funds 
in the first years of a plants operation 
but daniel borson author of the public citizen report said a 
detailed analysis of industry and government documents as well as 
interviews with utility executives indicates that the industry is 
not adequately preparing for what the eventual shutdown costs will 
be 
utility cost estimates often underestimate what it will cost to 
dispose of highly radioactive spent fuel and radioactive wastes as 
well as the decontamination of plants borson said 
while many nuclear plants have exceeded a third of their 
expected operating lives so far only about 35 billion has been 
allocated for shutdown activities and some of those funds could be 
threatened if a utility faces serious financial problems in the 
future 
clements the industry official disagreed he said that new nrc 
rules now being phased in will require that all cleanup funds be in 
separate accounts independent of a utilitys other corporate funds 
the council for energy awareness an umbrella group representing 
the views of the atomic power industry criticized the public 
citizen report saying the consumer group lacks the comprehensive 
financial and technical knowledge needed to produce valid cost 
estimates

ulysses started firing its 
thrusters thursday to point its main antenna toward earth and the 
shuttle that launched the probe was in fine shape after a 
17millionmile flight nasa said 
the space agency meanwhile formed a team to investigate why 
the shuttle discovery lifted off saturday with incorrect 
instructions for how it should operate some of its computer 
programs said shuttle project engineer chris fairey 
discovery landed early wednesday after sending ulysses on a 
fiveyear 186billionmile journey to study the suns poles 
the vehicle is in excellent condition said shuttle 
processing manager tip talone 
he said only 10 to 15 of discoverys heatshield tiles need to 
be replaced debris that hit the shuttle during its launch and 
landing caused 13 dings larger than one inch and about 50 
saller ones 
thats a very low number talone said every time we come 
back we seem to learn more about how to fly and land the thing 
without taking a lot of hits 
ulysses maneuvering which will end friday was designed to let 
the spacecraft communicate with controllers more quickly by using 
its highgain antenna a 54footwide dish said franklin 
odonnell a spokesman for nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
ulysses began firing its thrusters to start a complex series 
of maneuvers to turn itself around nearly 180 degrees to point the 
big dish toward earth odonnell said by phone from the pasadena 
laboratory 
the solar explorer has been communicating with its controllers 
through one of its smaller antennas limiting the rate at which 
information is transmitted he added 
the 250 million ulysses spacecraft is the centerpiece of a 750 
million joint mission by the european space agency and the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
six hours after discovery was launched saturday from cape 
canaveral fla ulysses was deployed from the shuttles cargo bay 
then three rocket stages hurled it out of earth orbit at a record 
escape speed of about 34000 mph 
ulysses was 368 million miles from earth on thursday zipping 
toward a 1992 flight past jupiter at 25372 mph odonnell said it 
will use jupiter as a gravity slingshot to become the first 
spacecraft to fly perpendicular to the plane in which the planets 
orbit the sun 
that will allow ulysses to fly over the suns south pole in 1994 
and north pole in 1995 however it will never get closer to the 
sun that it was when it was launched to study the suns poles 
ulysses doesnt need to get close to the sun only leave the plane 
of the planets 
fairey said the incorrect instructions were loaded into one of 
discoverys computers last thursday after that computer was used to 
update some of the programs on ulysses which was sitting inside 
the shuttles cargo bay at the time 
the investigators will recommend steps to prevent such an error 
from happening again he added 
the incorrect instructions were noticed and fixed by discoverys 
five astronauts about an hour after the shuttle was launched and 
never posed a danger to the shuttle or its crew even if the error 
hadnt been detected said milt heflin lead flight director at 
johnson space center in houston 
heflin had said nasa considered the problem serious because it 
went undetected before discovery was launched fairey called it 
really minor but said it did point out a minor deficiency in 
the way we code our software 
the incorrect instructions were among those that tell each of 
discoverys five computers which onboard devices they should 
operate during the shuttles flight 
talone said shuttle maintenance was proceeding smoothly so 
discovery should be ready for a oneday flight back to cape 
canaveral on monday riding piggyback on a modified jumbo jetliner 
discoverys new carbon brakes which have been tested on only 
one previous flight are in such great shape that you could fly 
those brakes today as they are he said nevertheless they were 
removed and sent to bf goodrich the manufacturer in ohio for 
detailed analysis 
odonnell said ulysses will fire its thrusters again monday and 
tuesday to adjust its trajectory toward jupiter

the consumer product safety commission should 
change its standards to prevent children from choking on the 
popular little people toys the new york state attorney general 
said thursday 
attorney general robert abrams sent a letter to the commission 
thursday asking it to alert parents to potential choking hazards 
of little people and increase the size of its smallparts standard 
for toys 
carol blackley a spokeswoman for fisherprice toys which makes 
little people said she was puzzled that abrams had singled out the 
line of miniature figures she called the toys among the safest 
things youll find in a childs environment 
in response to pressure from abrams fisherprice agreed in june 
to toughen the language of safety warnings on little people 
packages blackley said the chicagobased company a division of 
quaker oats co also paid new york state 25000 
in his letter to the commission abrams cited the recent deaths 
of two 6monthold boys who choked on little people 
but blackley noted that the little people package clearly states 
the toys are intended for children aged 2 to 6 
in the 30 years fisherprice has been making little people five 
children have choked to death on the figures she said all but one 
of those children were below the recommended age range she said 
david thome a spokesman for cpsc said a commission study found 
that between 1980 and 1989 146 children died after choking on 
toys of those 70 percent were caused by balloons marbles or 
small balls 
however he said the cpsc staff is still concerned about the 
potential danger posed by what he called small human toys and 
is looking at alternatives

congress is moving to ensure that farmers 
wont have to worry that future disputes over the federal budget 
will jeopardize their monthly government checks for idled erodible 
land 
representatives of the house and the senate have agreed to 
exclude the conservation reserve program from any automatic 
spendingcuts that might take place over the next four years 
congressional aides said thursday 
the program pays farmers to take environmentally sensitive 
acreage out of production for 10 years 
the exemption was proposed by the house in its version of the 
1990 farm bill the senate negotiators agreed late last week to the 
position said joe duggan a spokesman for the house agriculture 
committee 
the presidential office of management and budget had angered 
some farmers and lawmakers by insisting that crp payments be 
subject to any acrosstheboard cuts made under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law those cuts are supposed to kick in if 
congress doesnt take action on its own to shrink the budget 
deficit 
had the cuts taken effect this year crp payments could have 
been cut by 32 percent 
this action by the conferees settles this issue once and for 
all said sen tom daschle dsd omb will no longer be able 
to hold crp payments hostage to the fate of future budget 
negotiations 
daschle rep tim johnson dsd and the north dakota 
congressional delegation had written the farmbill conferees urging 
them to agree to the exemption 
the agriculture department paid farmers about 1 billion over 
the last year on 334000 crp contracts according to the house 
committee about 13 billion has been tentatively budgeted for the 
program for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the recent budget agreement that stopped the grammrudman cuts 
from taking effect will require the farm bill negotiators to reduce 
agricultural spending by 1 billion this year and 135 billion 
over the next five years 
however crp payments will not be subject to any of that 
reduction congressional aides said all of the proposed cut must 
come out of commodity credit corp benefits

about 40 percent of romanias ethnic 
germans have registered to leave the country since dictator nicolae 
ceausescu fell last december according to figures released 
thursday 
the interior ministry in a statement carried by the state news 
agency rompres said 92650 of romanias ethnic germans estimated 
to be 220000 at the time of the revolution already had passports 
to leave the country 
about 70000 of them already have left the ministry said 
the ethnic germans are among 120603 people who have applied to 
leave since ceausescus ouster the statement said independent 
sources say the real figure is much higher 
since the elimination of travel restrictions after the 
revolution more than 10 million romanians out of a population of 
23 million have gone abroad as tourists 
diplomatic sources say millions would like to remain outside 
romania but because romanians no longer qualify for the refugee 
status they had when the country was a dictatorship western 
countries have rejected most wouldbe emigres 
the notable exception is germany which has accepted almost 
100000 immigrants the overwhelming majority ethnic germans 
another 10000 romanian citizens mainly members of the 
2millionstrong ethnic hungarian community have headed for 
hungary officials said 
florin albulescu of german forum an organization for the ethnic 
minority said most ethnic germans leave because of poor standards 
of living in romania and the temptation of the miraculous german 
economy 
the countrys ethnic germans were once estimated at 500000 
but many left following a 1978 agreement between bucharest and 
bonn that allowed germans to pay their way out of romania for up to 
8000 each said german forum president thomas nagler

a roman catholic school revised the pledge 
of allegiance to say with liberty and justice for the born and 
unborn angering some students who said the issue has no place in 
a patriotic oath 
its like changing the constitution angela martinez a 
lorain catholic high school junior said thursday 
robert garcia a senior also said the change which began this 
week was a bad idea 
i feel the born and unborn shouldnt be added the pledge is 
a pledge to your country the pledge deals with patriotism 
he said 
this week has been designated by us catholic schools as 
respect for life week said robert kealey executive director 
for the washington dcbased national catholic education 
association students are being urged to reflect on the issues of 
abortion euthanasia the homeless and poverty 
kealey whose association represents most catholic secondary and 
elementary schools in the country said he had not heard of any 
other school altering the pledge of allegiance 
jerry lackamp director of communications for the cleveland 
catholic diocese said references to the unborn in the pledge is 
not policy for catholic schools in northeast ohio 
principal joanne miller was said to be in a faculty meeting on 
thursday and not available to comment 
reporters trying to interview students were told to leave school 
grounds 
in an interview published thursday with the lorain journal 
ms miller defended the change as appropriate 
we are a catholic school and therefore our philosophy is one 
of prolife she said the pledge change was suggested to us 
it does not go against our philosophy 
i did not realize there was a difficulty with this until 
tuesday morning i was wondering if the students concerned would 
come talk with me they have not she said 
the chronicle telegram in nearby elyria reported thursday the 
phrase was added at the request of the knights of columbus a 
catholic fraternal organization 
tom laubenthal a trustee with the elyria k of c council said 
the organization regularly uses the phrase at its meetings just 
because of our stance on abortion 
some of the 400 students who attend the school in this lake erie 
port city about 35 miles west of cleveland said they were not 
required to recite the added phrase but several said they felt 
pressure to do so 
a lot of students when they say the pledge say justice for 
all and then sit down and you just hear the rest over the pa 
system said marcie apont an eighthgrader 
some students in the working class neighborhood had threatened 
to boycott classes thursday morning to protest the pledge change 
but students questioned after school said they had not skipped 
classes and did not know if others had 
senior meghan chapple said she supported the change 
i believe its ok for catholic schools to do it because 
thats our beliefs she said it has the same emphasis and 
values behind it that our prayers do theyre at a catholic 
school and should be expected to uphold the catholic values

the wealthiest people in america would face 
higher tax rates but still collect tax cuts averaging more than 
9000 a year under a plan endorsed thursday by president bush 
the plan advanced by conservative republicans in the house 
would exclude more than half of capital gains from taxation and 
raise the 28 percent maximum income tax rate on the richest people 
to 31 percent it would reduce the top rate affecting some 
uppermiddleincome people from 33 percent to 31 percent 
the congressional budget office estimated people with incomes of 
200000 or more would realize tax cuts averaging 9097 a year 
that would represent a 62 percent reduction in their federal tax 
liabilities 
those with incomes between 100000 and 200000 would get a 44 
percent tax cut averaging 1541 a year families with income 
between 40000 and 50000 would see tax cuts averaging 54 or 
05 percent 
families with incomes under 10000 would get nothing on average 
from the proposal cbo said those making between 20000 and 
30000 would get a 14 tax cut an average reduction of 03 
percent 
the republican proposal which was rejected by democratic 
negotiators last month would reduce from 33 percent to 31 percent 
the marginal tax rate on couples with taxable income between

the marginal rate applies to any additional income earned 
taxable income is after deductions and exemptions have been 
subtracted 
in reducing the 33 percent rate the gop proposal also would 
eliminate a quirk in the law that allows people with the highest 
incomes to pay a 28 percent marginal rate while some 
uppermiddleincome people pay a 33 percent rate 
the bill sponsored chiefly by reps john kasich of ohio and 
carl pursell of michigan would exempt from taxation 516 percent 
of longterm capital gains which are profits from the sale of 
investments held a year or longer capital gains now are fully 
taxed at the same rates that apply to other income 
the combination of the capitalgains exclusion and the new rate 
structure would have these effects 
capital gains of people in the highest 31 percent tax 
bracket would have an effective capitalgains rate of 15 percent 
people in the 28 percent bracket would pay an effective rate of 
1355 percent on capital gains 
taxpayers in the lowest bracket 15 percent would pay an 
effective 726 percent rate on capital gains 
couples with no children and filing a joint return would pay a 
15 percent rate on their first 32450 of taxable income 28 
percent on the next segment between 32450 and 78400 and 31 
percent on everything above 78400 
a single person would pay 15 percent on the first 19450 28 
percent on the next segment between 19450 and 47050 and 31

americans achieved most of the objectives aimed 
at lowering their blood pressures during the past decade with one 
important exception losing weight the national centers for 
disease control said thursday 
seven of the nine us health objectives relating to blood 
pressure have been met including a reduction in the rate of high 
blood pressure nationwide the cdc said 
in 1979 when the federal department of health and human 
services prepared its 1990 health goals for the nation 
hypertension high blood pressure was defined as a reading of 
16095 or higher 
by this year the government hoped to have at least 60 percent 
of americans who met that definition to control their blood 
pressures with medication diet and exercise one recent survey 
indicated a level of 65 percent the cdc said 
however the goal of reducing the overweight population to less 
than 10 percent of adult men and less than 17 percent of adult 
women was not reached the cdc said 
according to a 1988 federal survey 27 percent of adult men and 
26 percent of adult women were more than 20 percent above their 
recommended weight it said 
being overweight increases the risk of high blood pressure 
which is in turn a cause of heart disease and strokes 
improvements in blood pressure control have contributed to 
a 50 percent decrease in stroke and a 35 percent decrease in 
coronary heart disease since 1972 the atlantabased cdc said 
citing a 1988 federal report 
despite this progress 30 million persons in the united states 
still have inadequately controlled blood pressure 
although comprehensive studies are not complete the goal of 
having at least 60 percent of the hypertensive population in 
control of their blood pressure has most likely been met the 
cdc said citing various studies over the past several years 
however in 1984 federal health officials revised the standard 
for hypertension to a reading of 14090 and progress at that level 
is less certain the cdc said 
a study in south carolina showed 38 percent of hypertensive 
people as defined under the stricter standard lowering their 
blood pressure with medication diet and exercise the cdc said 
progress toward the 1990 goals cannot be definitely 
determined until statistics from a new national survey are 
analyzed over the next several years it said 
other bloodpressure goals which were met include 
more than half of us adults should know the principal risk 
factors for heart disease and stroke high blood pressure smoking 
high cholesterol diabetes 
more than 90 percent of adults should know whether they have 
high blood pressure 
at least half of processed food in grocery stores should be 
labeled with sodium and caloric content 
other goals also met targeted public health systems and 
research methodology 
progress is unknown toward one goal reducing the average daily 
salt intake to less than 21 of an ounce no studies have been done 
to provide such data the cdc said sodium a component of salt 
contributes to high blood pressure

in his sensuous poetry imbued with mythology and politics 
octavio paz has helped shape mexicos idea of itself and long 
served as interpreter of his nations soul for the west 
he finds company among the latin american literary greats who 
have profoundly influenced the politics of their nations and 
channeled their cultures into the mainstream of world literature 
mexican novelist carlos fuentes has called paz the greatest 
living mexican writer great renovator of the spanish language 
great universal poet and essayist 
peruvian writer mario vargas llosa said paz was one of the 
greatest poets that the spanishlanguage world has produced and at 
the same time a great humanist 
but the selfstyled socialist and democrat has been heavily 
criticized by the mexican left and virtually ostacized by his peers 
for his political views which defy allegiance to either left or 
right 
he has chosen the life of political dissident in his country 
paz resigned from a 25year diplomatic career to protest the 
governments suppression of student demonstrations during the 1968 
olympic games in mexico city and has since devoted himself to 
writing and lecturing he received an honorary doctorate from 
harvard university in 1980 
the newest nobel laureate is known in mexico as a poet 
essayist diplomat critic professor translator polemicist and 
founder of literary journals 
his poetry and essays cover concerns ranging from surrealism and 
socialism to archaeology and oriental philosophy but above all 
paz 76 is immersed in his countrys geography climate and 
mythology 
our history writes paz has been a discontinuous process 
of fits and starts at times a dance at others a lethargy 
interrupted by a sudden violent awakening 
again and again we spanish and spanishamericans rub eyes and 
ask what time is it in world history our time never coincides 
with other times we are always either ahead or behind 
among his bestknown works are the labyrinth of solitude a 
classic analysis of the mexican psyche and his long sensuous 
poems sun stone and blanca 
critics have said his writing expresses pazs sense of the deep 
loneliness of man which can be transcended only through attempts 
at communion sexual love compassion and faith 
paz describes poetry as the memory of a country and says 
poets must be critics of their times 
and the giant of mexican letters has never shunned controversy 
his essays have angered both the left and the right 
he miffed the leftist literati by equating president fidel 
castro of cuba with former chilean strongman augusto pinochet and 
dismissing the 1979 leftist revolution in nicaragua as 
inconsequential 
i am an interlocutor who is hated and read by the left he 
once said 
at the same time he has frequently denounced the institutional 
revolutionary party which has ruled mexico for 61 years as 
corrupt and out of touch with the people it was formed to help 
paz was born in mexico city on march 31 1914 into what he has 
described as a typical mexican family his mothers relatives 
emigrated from andalusia in spain and his fathers ancestors were 
mexicans of indian descent 
his paternal grandfather was a writer journalist and political 
activist who espoused the cause of the peasantry it was in his 
vast private library that the young paz first read extensively 
his father a lawyer embraced the mexican revolution of 1910 
and was an ardent supporter of mexican revolutionary emiliano 
zapata the young writer was active in marxist movements at the 
university of mexico 
but pazs family was ruined during the upheavals of the civil 
war and he spent his boyhood in a suburb of mexico city in a large 
house that was he once said crumbling to bits 
as rooms collapsed he recalled in rita guiberts 1973 book 
seven voices we moved the furniture into others he lived 
for a time in a large room with only part of a wall 
at 17 paz founded the avantgarde literary journal 
barrandal and at 19 published his first book of poetry 
forest moon 
he went to spain for a year during the spanish civil war and 
took up the antifranco republican cause he told guibert that 
spain taught me the meaning of the word fraternity 
paz used such experiences and the insights they gave him to 
write the scores of essays and hundreds of poems that have helped 
shape mexicos idea of itself and the way in which it is perceived 
abroad 
for this work he on thursday won one of the worlds top prizes 
for a writer the nobel prize for literature

octavio paz said he would rather die than stop 
writing poetry which has unlocked doors to travel and diplomacy 
and on thursday brought him the nobel prize in literature 
the 76yearold mexican author said he was in a manhattan hotel 
room sleeping peacefully when the phone rang with the news from 
sweden 
i was very very surprised he told reporters the prize 
means a great lot not in the sense its a passport to immortality 
but it gives you the possibility of a wider audience even the most 
expert writer needs an audience 
paz a former ambassador to india is no stranger to praise in 
1981 he received the most important award in the spanishspeaking 
world the cervantes prize in 1982 he captured the prestigious 
american neustadt prize 
poetry is not a very popular art form these days but its an 
essential part of human life paz said poetry is the memory of 
a country of language without poetry people cant even talk 
well 
i dont want to retire until im dead he said 
paz in new york for a mexican art exhibit at the metropolitan 
museum of art answered questions in spanish french and english 
from journalists from around the world 
he spoke energetically behind a podium his thick eyebrows and 
full head of hair giving him a youthful presence his blue eyes 
calmly moved about the room settling on each person he answered 
reflecting on his 25 years as a diplomat he said poets must be 
critics of society he said the current century with its two world 
wars concentration camps and the atomic bomb had been very 
cruel 
paz resigned his job as ambassador to protest his governments 
suppression of student demonstrations at the 1968 olympic games in 
mexico city 
it has been a terrble century said paz but we have had 
great moments many poets have died in concentration camps 
now we are seeing the coming back of freedom all over the 
world and that is important art and also the great change of the 
world has given me great pleasure he said 
he also reflected on years as a writer 
we are born alone and the first thing is to be with others i 
have to communicate this thirst of communion language is a common 
property a writer is only the guardian of language a collective 
wealth said paz 
my only job he said was to write the best i could

congressional republicans who vowed to fight 
any effort to raise income taxes are having second thoughts 
fearing theyre being tarred as the protectors of the rich 
i think we made a mistake this party made a mistake taking 
this blood oath against tax rate increases said fred grandy 
riowa who took it himself 
im sick and tired of going home to rural wisconsin and 
protecting a republican image as the party of the rich added 
rep steve gunderson rwis and i dont do it 
gunderson is among the majority of house republicans who only a 
few months ago pledged in writing not to touch top tax rates now 
in the 11th hour of crafting a fiveyear 500 billion deficit 
reduction plan those tax changes seem more acceptable than some 
alternatives such as a boost in the tax on gasoline 
rep duncan hunter of california the house republican research 
chairman took the house floor on thursday to announce his view 
republicans stand for cutting the gas tax one of the most 
vocal opponents of touching tax rates in the past he repeated the 
gas tax assertion four times and never once mentioned the income 
tax rate 
adding to the republican problem is the confusion over just 
where president bush and the congressional republicans stand on the 
issue bush famous for his read my lips pledge not to raise 
taxes was out in front of most of his partys leaders in dropping 
that promise 
and on thursday the president said he could trade a modest 
increase in income taxes on the wealthiest americans for a deep cut 
in capital gains rates 
republicans may have reason to worry about public perceptions 
a recent national poll by the times mirror news organization 
indicated that since bush took office more and more americans 
consider the republican party the party of the rich 
asked what does it mean to be a republican 51 percent 
volunteered that republicans were allied with rich powerful 
moneyed interests in 1987 only 21 percent gave that answer 
sen don nickles rokla chairman of the gops senate campaign 
effort this year said the portrayal was unfair but he acknowledged 
the issue was hurting 
i think so far the democrats have been pretty successful in 
demagoguing the issue theyre taking advantage of it he said 
nickles said republicans now might support what he called 
making the tax rates more understandable that is making the 
marginal tax rates on the wealthy match those of the upper middle 
class but without a net increase in revenue 
house gop leader bob michel rill said he was struggling with 
other gop lawmakers to come up with a republican alternative 
budget 
he said his ranks were divided on whether to exchange a rate 
increase on the wealthy for a capital gains tax cut in line with 
bushs position but the house republican policy committee on 
wednesday included in its budget proposal a plan to raise the top 
tax rate on the wealthy to 31 percent in exchange for cutting the 
rate on capital gains to 15 percent 
phony populism is how house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo portrays the latest gop effort 
democrats have insisted on rates of at least 20 percent on 
capital gains and 32 percent on the upper incomes in an effort to 
prevent what they call another tax break for the rich 
quite frankly the price is still too high michel said 
but for a growing number in his party michel said raising 
taxes on the rich was an attractive alternative to raising gasoline 
taxes cutting medicare or other features in the budget deal now 
working its way through congress 
there are some who are really worried about the rich man 
versus poor man argument who would without too much prodding go 
to 33 percent he said 
rep mickey edwards rokla the chairman of the policy 
committee denied his groups plan was in reaction to the polls or 
democratic rhetoric 
we have never been a party that was sympathetic to the 
higher incomes he said

responsibility for wednesday nights attacks in calls to a roman 
catholic radio station

of the marine residence and opened fire with machine guns said 
us embassy spokesman bruce wharton the two police guarding the 
residence were injured and one of them died on the way to the 
hospital wharton said

drug smugglers as revolutionaries our struggle is based on the 
highest ethical standards no more yankees no more drugs

defense attorneys offered conflicting assessments about the 
abundance of deer in the area where rogerson shot the 37yearold 
mother of twin yearold girls 
jeffrey hjelm the assistant attorney general prosecuting the 
case said in his opening remarks that wardens examined the area of 
the shooting and found only one deer track he said that track was 
behind where rogerson fired the fatal shot 
defense attorney lewis vafiades countered that two other hunters 
who had been with rogerson before the shooting had spotted several 
deer in that area earlier in the day 
the prosecution contends rogerson acted negligently or 
recklessly when he killed mrs wood who was about 130 feet behind 
her house 
mrs woods husband kevin who now lives in bettendorf iowa 
said he didnt think a conviction would help heal emotional scars 
because there are no winners in this situation 
hours after the shooting rogerson was charged with 
manslaughter but the charge was dropped in december 1988 after a 
county grand jury concluded his actions were neither criminally 
negligent nor criminally reckless 
the state attorney generals office reopened the case after a 
portland television station reported that vafiades nephew had 
served on the first grand jury a special grand jury indicted 
rogerson on manslaughter charges in december 1989

physicians at a conference on suicide warned 
thursday that an economic downturn could spark a dramatic increase 
in adult suicides 
if recession is defined as nine months of rising unemployment 
the correlation is extremely strong between the vicissitudes of 
the economy and actual suicide said dr andrew slaby president 
of the eastern division of the american suicide foundation 
slaby spoke at a news briefing before the foundations oneday 
conference at a midtown hotel on preventing evaluating and 
managing suicidal behavior 
about 1500 physicians therapists psychologists and social 
workers from a threestate area registered for the gathering 
described by organizers as the largest of its kind in the united 
states 
slaby psychiatrist in chief at the regent hospital in 
manhattan said studies on suicide rates during the depression 
found suicides increased most among white successful males and 
black women the two that really suffered the most when they lost 
jobs 
in times of economic hardship he said black women were often 
among the first to lose jobs he noted that domestic workers relied 
for employment on affluent white men who had lost jobs themselves 
dr herbert hendin the american suicide foundations executive 
director said there are no figures measuring the effect of the 
current economic downturn on the suicide rate but he said 
throughout the century the suicide rate went up when the economy 
declined 
in september the nations unemployment rose to 57 percent it 
was the first time since the 198182 recession that the jobless 
rate increased three months in a row 
slaby also noted the suicide rate generally has declined during 
war times the 19th century french sociologist emile durkheim found 
there were fewer suicides during the great wars in europe in the 
19th century 
the us suicide rate rose during world war i world war ii and 
the korean war but not during the vietnam war slaby said 
people feel less desperation when they bond together and fight 
for a common cause he said 
the american suicide foundation said 30796 people 24272 men 
and 6524 women committed suicide in the united states in 1987 
although more men commit suicide more women attempt suicide it 
said 
because men use more violent means to kill themselves than 
women they are more likely to succeed slaby said women are more 
likely to seek counseling or help from peers he said 
but slaby noted that the suicide rate among professional women 
is rapidly increasing 
among 15 to 24 year olds suicide is the second leading cause of 
death after accidents according to the foundation 
the foundation was formed two years ago and funds research at 
major medical centers in the treatment and prevention of depression 
and suicide

despite some losses to dry weather farmers 
are still harvesting a bumper corn crop estimated at a fouryear 
high of 802 billion bushels up 7 percent from last year the 
agriculture department said thursday 
however the new estimate by the departments agricultural 
statistics board was down 1 percent from last months forecast of 
812 billion bushels 
early in september lack of moisture in the western corn belt 
caused deteriorating crop conditions the boards report said 
crop conditions lagged furthest behind in illinois indiana and 
missouri 
farmers harvested 753 billion bushels in 1989 and the 
department in its initial 1990 forecast on aug 9 put this falls 
harvest at 785 billion bushels before raising it last month 
john a schnittker of schnittker associates a washingtonbased 
consulting firm said the forecast is almost equal to the amount 
of corn we will need in the next 12 months to meet domestic and 
export demands now projected 
but the bad news he said is that this corn crop coincides 
with a glut in wheat especially big wheat producers including 
the united states are subsidizing exports in an effort to unload 
surpluses 
the big wheat crop glutting the world market and the 
subsidization of wheat pushing it below corn prices is the real 
problem schnittker said 
based on oct 1 surveys corn yields were estimated at a record 
1203 bushels per acre harvested compared with 1162 last year and 
1217 indicated last month the old record was 1194 bushels in 
1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 58 percent in 
1989 the sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 are expected 
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 182 billion bushels down 5 percent from 
last years harvest of 193 billion bushels and 1 percent below the 
september forecast of 183 billion bushels 
cotton production was indicated at 145 million bales up 19 
percent from last years output of 122 million bales but down 1 
percent from the september forecast 
the revised estimates showed total wheat production at 274 
billion bushels up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest but down 
slightly from last month 
the departments allcrops production index was reported at 111 
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison down one 
percentage point from september but still the highest reading since 
the index averaged 116 percent in 1985 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 199091 marketing year that 
began on sept 1 is expected to be about 8095 billion bushels 
including domestic and export requirements 
with demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production that will 
mean a decrease in us corn stockpiles to about 1273 billion 
bushels left over by sept 1 1991 
but the downturn would be modest compared with 1989 when the 
corn stockpile plummeted from 426 billion bushels on sept 1 1988 
to 193 billion bushels on hand last sept 1 
the report sid us corn prices may average in the range of 
220 to 260 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year up 10 
cents from the september projection corn prices at the farm 
averaged about 236 per bushel last season 
no significant changes were reported in the us wheat supply 
and demand situation and prices at the farm are expected to 
average 255 to 285 per bushel this marketing year down from 
372 in 198990 
soybean prices at the farm were forecast at 570 to 7 per 
bushel in 199091 compared with 570 the past marketing year 
that was up 20 cents on the lower end of the range in september 
other 1990 crop estimates based on oct 1 indications compared 
with 1989 output included 
sorghum 5619 million bushels and an average yield of 607 
bushels per acre compared with 6179 million and 554 in 1989 
rice 158 million hundredweight and a yield of 5629 pounds per 
acre compared with 1545 million and 5749 
peanuts 336 billion pounds and a yield of 1917 pounds per 
acre compared with 399 billion and 2426 
tobacco 158 billion pounds and a yield of 2166 pounds per 
acre compared with 137 billion and 2016 
sugar beets 271 million tons and a yield of 1989 tons per 
acre compared with 251 million and 194 
sugar cane 257 million tons and a yield of 357 tons per 
acre compared with 294 million and 345

the government on thursday 
proposed seizing all communist party property without compensation 
highlighting the growing anger at czechoslovakias former rulers 
during a time of economic hardship 
the state news agency said the plan would be presented 
immediately to parliament for approval 
about 60000 people jammed the old town square in prague late 
thursday in a show of support for the proposal 
the ctk news agency said the expropriation plan would remove 
property the communist party had gained in unjust ways giving it 
an advantage over other political parties and movements in 
contradiction to democratic principles 
according to news reports the communist party still controls 
property worth about 368 million government spokesman zbynek 
fiala said party assets totaled 793 million before 
czechoslovakias peaceful revolution late last year 
but communist party secretary jiri machalik contested the 
figures saying on thursday that much of the partys property had 
already been handed over to the government he said the remaining 
assets were worth about 145 million 
machalik added the communists had proposed an alternate proposal 
that would allow the party to retain some property in prague and 
elsewhere 
party property includes buildings communications equipment 
recreation centers newspapers and other assets 
the government began a gradual transfer of property away from 
the communists in may when it froze party assets but as economic 
difficulties heighten in the central european country many people 
now consider that insufficient 
anticommunist sentiment has been growing steadily in 
czechoslovakia government officials said last month the party had 
lost more than a million members or about half its adherents in 
the 10 months since the revolution 
anger deepened following reports sunday that communist party 
leader vasil mohorita had criticized the countrys economic reforms 
and urged disbanded communist party committees at work places be 
reestablishd 
the comments were seen by many as a way of making political 
gains out of czechoslovakias economic troubles the soviet union 
has fallen short of its targets for oil deliveries and the 
government last week announced higher prices for heating oil and 
gasoline 
the crowd jamming pragues old town square on thursday warned 
they would not tolerate any attempt by the communists to regain 
control of the country 
we do not want political trials we do not want to see 
communists in jail we just want them to go said milan dolejsi

but many of the younger participants were more radically 
inclined miroslav kulhavy of the greens party demanded prosecution

britains foreign secretary warned thursday the world will 
revert to anarchy if the international coalition against iraq 
collapses and said saddam hussein must be told force will be used 
if iraq doesnt withdraw from kuwait 
the air force meanwhile grounded all training flights in the 
persian gulf region for 24 hours from midday wednesday until midday 
thursday to discuss air safety with pilots the order followed 
separate accidents this week in which 12 us servicemen died 
a group of 321 western evacuees from iraq and kuwait landed in 
britain on thursday in the first such flight in nearly three weeks 
most of the passengers were americans and many were children 
the americans and canadians on the flight were to leave friday 
for raleighdurham international airport in north carolina said 
andrew varney gatwick airports director of public affairs 
while westerners continued to flee occupied kuwait with tales of 
low food supplies and looting by iraqi troops international 
pressure grew against saddam to withdraw from the oilrich emirate 
he invaded and annexed 
speaking at the annual conference of the governing conservative 
party in bournemouth england british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd urged the world to remain united against iraqs occupation 
if it does not hold then despite the coalition despite the 
leadership of the united states despite the cooperation of the 
soviet union then we shall be back in a world of anarchy 
punctuated by explosions of force hurd said 
the clouds would have extinguished the light we cannot allow 
this to happen 
hurd also said saddam should know that force will be used if 
iraq does not pull out of kuwait which his troops invaded on aug 
2 
day by day we must build in the minds of the iraqis the 
certainty that they have to leave kuwait if not peacefully then 
forced out by military action hurd said 
mondays killing by israeli police of 19 arabs during a riot in 
jerusalem brought international outcry and united arab nations 
against israel a close ally of the united states there was 
concern that the israeli action might weaken arab support for the 
multinational military presence in the gulf 
the un security council is considering means of censuring 
israel that would satisfy outraged arab nations and also israels 
allies 
oil prices rose 173 a barrel in new york thursday to close at 
4043 on unfounded rumors that a palestine terrorist group lobbed 
missiles into the israelioccupied west bank land taken from the 
arabs in the 1967 war stocks in new york again fell down 4282 
points to an 18month low at 236510 
more than 170000 us troops are deployed in saudi arabia and 
on warships in the gulf region backed by vessels and soldiers from 
other countries most nations with few exceptions have condemned 
iraqs aggression 
the air force announced it had halted all training flights in 
the gulf region but not reconnaissance missions and other 
operational patrols said a second pentagon spokesman col 
miguel monteverde 
there are an estimated 700 air force combat and support aircraft 
in the gulf region under operation desert shield 
the air force declared a flying standdown for one day to 
conduct safety awareness meetings with air force pilots williams 
said 
he said the grounding was to get together with everybody and 
just sort of review what they need to do to fly more safely 
the official death toll for desert shield rose to 24 on 
wednesday when an air force f111 fighterbomber crashed on a 
training mission in saudi arabia killing both crew members 
on monday two pilots were killed in the crash of an air force 
f4 phantom reconnaissance jet in saudi arabia hours earlier two 
marine corps uh1 huey helicopters each carrying four crew 
members crashed over the arabian sea the eight men are listed as 
missing 
williams said however that the militarys safety record since 
troops began to be deployed two months ago remained good under the 
circumstances 
given the amount of flying that has to be done given the 
extraordinary circumstances and given the higher than ordinary 
operating tempo in the area i think our service people are doing 
very well he said 
the freedom flight from iraq and kuwait arriving in london on 
thursday was the first since sept 22 and like previous flights 
carried mostly women and children and western men of arab origin 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
described as simply outrageous iraqi treatment of the 270 
americans and foreignborn family members aboard the flight 
ms tutwiler said iraqi authorities interrogated and harassed 
the departing passengers forcing lengthy delays some evacuees said 
they were threatened with weapons and a dozen people were prevented 
from boarding the flight she said 
until thursday freedom flights had transported about 1900 
americans out of iraq and kuwait recent state department estimates 
indicated more than 600 americans were stranded in kuwait and more 
than 300 in iraq 
american and other western men are being held in iraq and 
kuwait many at strategic iraqi installations to deter against any

the senate voted thursday to ban the use of 
largescale drift nets in us waters up to 200 miles offshore as 
well as their use by domestic fishing fleets anywhere in the world 
the nets which can extend up to 40 miles have been blamed 
for the deaths of thousands of dolphins other sea mammals and 
birds caught in their paths as they float through the water to trap 
tuna and other commercial fish 
the us ban as well as language directing the bush 
administration to seek an international outlawing of drift net 
fishing was included in a bill approved 980 extending the 
magnuson fishery and conservation act another five years 
named after the late sen warren magnuson dwash the 1976 law 
established exclusive us economic control over commercial and 
sport fishing within 200 miles of the us coastline 
the bill extends that control to tuna which had been exempted 
from it in the past because they migrate over international 
boundaries similar legislation was approved by the house last 
february 
the legislation also includes a provision by sen joseph biden 
ddel that would require the development of government standards 
that tuna canners would have to adopt in order to label their 
product dolphinsafe 
in response to environmental campaigns and tv documentaries with 
dramatic footage of waterbreathing dolphins suffocating in tuna 
drift nets when brought to the surface starkist last april began 
publicizing its use of dolphinsafe practices and labeling 
their cans as such 
biden said the labels have been abused and bastardized by 
other tuna canners whose practices continue to result in dolphin 
deaths in their fishing operations

the african national congress 
accused president fw de klerk of negotiating in bad faith 
thursday and warned of a renewed armed struggle if peace talks 
break down 
de klerk later denied the allegation before leaving for a visit 
to britain and portugal he said the anc charge appeared timed to 
coincide with his trip 
a government minister meanwhile criticized an anc leaders 
statement that the organization was continuing to recruit fighters 
for its suspended armed struggle 
anc spokesman sakkie macozoma told a news conference the 
government reneged on an agreement to release only a joint 
statement after mondays meeting between de klerk and anc deputy 
president nelson mandela 
after the meeting de klerk also announced that anc and other 
political exiles could begin applying for permission to return to 
south africa he said there were no guarantees indemnity from 
prosecution would be granted 
his statement addressed a key anc demand that the estimated 
20000 anc exiles be permitted to come home 
macozoma said de klerks announcement preempted further work by 
a governmentanc committee studying the issue 
de klerk and the governments undermining of efforts to 
achieve a genuine peace settlement places the whole negotiations 
process in jeopardy macozoma said 
he distributed a document mandela gave de klerk at the meeting 
in it mandela warned the anc would have no choice but to resume 
its armed struggle if peace talks failed 
the anc suspended its armed struggle in august as a condition 
for the talks on ending apartheid and setting up negotiations on 
powersharing between the white minority and black majority 
it should be plainly understoood that if we ever once again 
face a situation in which all constitutional avenues for an advance 
to democracy are closed we will have no option but to use other 
methods the mandela document said if this is war talk then i 
too plead guilty 
de klerk told a hastily arranged airport news conference the anc 
statements would not derail negotiations 
i hope that the leadership of the anc will also refrain from 
any act or statement which will unnecessarily endanger this and 
will make sure of their facts before they make an attack on the 
integrity of the government he said 
gerrit viljoen the minister of constitutional development 
accused the anc of violating its agreement to suspend the armed 
struggle by continuing to recruit fighters he was referring to 
comments by chris hani head of the ancs armed wing that 
recruitment continued 
in suspending its armed struggle the anc agreed to halt 
related activities viljoen told a news briefing 
related activities surely must include the recruitment of 
people for training for armed action and training and keeping them 
in camps and having ammunition stores and so on he said 
relations between the whiteled government and the anc the 
largest black opposition movement have been strained by black 
faction fighting that has killed about 800 people in two months 
the fighting in black townships around johannesburg has pitted 
xhosas and other blacks linked to the anc against zulu supporters 
of the conservative inkatha movement 
mandela and other black leaders accuse security forces of 
instigating the clashes perhaps at the behest of rightwing 
extremists opposed to the governmentanc talks 
his statement to de klerk called for an independent judicial 
inquiry into the violence and charges that inkatha fighters were 
trained by government forces 
a reluctance to subject such widespread allegations to 
impartial inquiry fuels a popular perception that there are forces 
close to you mr president with a double agenda the document

a bomb in a crowded 
discoteque thursday killed the galician separatist who apparently 
brought it in and two other people a government spokeswoman said 
fortynine people were injured 
the predawn blast was one of six early thursday in the 
northwestern region of galicia the disco bomb was the only fatal 
explosion and was apparently accidental said spokeswoman rosa 
conde 
the other bombings were aimed at property owned by or linked to 
cocaine smugglers regional officials said the separatists claimed 
responsibility for the nonlethal bombs said pontevedra province 
official jorge parada 
police found and defused a seventh bomb at a bank after 
receiving a telephoned bomb threat from the separatists he said 
more explosives were later found in a rented car parked near the 
disco 
the explosion destroyed the clangor dance club and killed 
ignacio villar regueiro the suspected member of the exercito 
guerrilleiro de pobo galego ceibe the guerrilla army of the free 
galician people conde said 
two women were killed eleven of those injured were hospitalized 
in serious condition late thursday hospital spokesmen said 
about 5000 university of santiago students marched silently 
through the city the capital of the region to protest the disco 
bombing which injured some of their classmates 
the separatist group seeking independence for the fourprovince 
region in northwest spain has claimed more than 50 attacks since 
its first action in march 1986 
it is the weakest of the three major separatist movements in 
spain the others being the basques in northeast spain and the 
catalonians in the southeast 
although galicians speak a separate tongue closer to portuguese 
than spanish the notion of a separate state has attracted little 
voter sympathy 
the bombings against the traffickers whose influence in galicia 
has grown notably in recent years could be an attempt to rally 
support for the separatists goals parada suggested 
the bombs destroyed or damaged a clothing boutique a car 
dealership a canning factory a bar and a bank branch all in 
pontevedra province parada said 
the targeted cocaine traffickers were among more than 30 people 
jailed last june in a major antidrug sweep officials said 
the smugglers have been adapting routes long used to move 
contraband tobacco along galicias jagged coast to become major 
distributors of cocaine in europe 
so far this year narcotics agents have captured more than a ton 
of colombian cocaine in galicia almost a third of all the cocaine 
seized last year in spain

the food and drug administration has told a 
sunscreen maker to stop claiming its products protect against a 
broad spectrum of the suns rays 
in an oct 5 letter released thursday the fda told 
scheringplough corp officials to correct the labeling on 
shade and any of its other sunscreen products by removing 
references to protection against ultraviolet a rays 
the uva protection claim is unproven because there are no 
generally recognized testing procedures for determining uva 
protection the fda said 
scheringplough includes on the labels of its shade products 
the designation app the companys uva protection factor 
expressed as a percentage of the spectrum blocked by the 
sunscreens 
uva rays are longer less intense rays that are believed to 
contribute to cancer wrinkles and other skin damage 
ultraviolet b or uvb rays are the shorter burning rays that 
cause sunburn and some skin cancers these rays can be measured and 
are often expressed as a sun protection factor or spf 
the agency gave the company 10 days after receipt of the letter 
to advise the fda what corrective measure had been taken 
otherwise the fda said it was prepared to take the matter to 
court 
lewis nolan a spokesman for scheringplough healthcare 
products said the company wants to meet with the fda as soon as 
possible to discuss the issue 
the company believes that fda questions over the type of 
information communicated to consumers about uva protection can be 
resolved to the satisfaction of all parties he said 
in letters to several companies last february the fda warned 
sunscreen makers that claims of uva protection were 
unsubstantiated and therefore unacceptable 
uva protection claims can give consumers a false sense of 
security the fda said because sunbathers who believe they are 
adequately protected may stay out in the sun longer 
the only company the fda allows to make uva protection claims is 
herbert laboratories photoplex the product contains a new 
ingredient which required it to undergo a more intensive 
effectiveness review by the fda

president bush said thursday he could trade a 
modest increase in taxes on affluent americans for a deep cut in 
capital gains rates but that it was a waste of time to try to 
push such a deal through a divided congress 
instead bush called on lawmakers to put aside that battle and 
come up with a 500billion deficitreduction plan that contains 
neither element 
within hours democrats on the house ways and means committee 
said they were well into writing an alternative budget that would 
not only raise taxes on rich americans but push them higher than 
bush has said he can accept 
the committees chairman dan rostenkowski of illinois said the 
changes would restore fairness to our tax system he said the 
democrats would meet again friday to decide whether the package 
will also reduce the capital gains tax rate but if it does itll 
be a lot less rich than the administrations version 
congressional committees are working toward the goal of finding 
a halftrillion dollars in spending cuts and tax increases before 
the oct 19 deadline when the latest emergency spending 
authorization expires 
by most accounts higher medicare premiums and taxes on alcohol 
cigarettes and gasoline are likely to be included 
we believe we have made progress senate democratic leader 
george mitchell said after a meeting with republican leader bob 
dole and members of the finance committee 
trying to end two days of confusion surrounding the presidents 
position on taxes the white house laid out but said it wouldnt 
push a plan that would combine higher taxes on the 500000 or so 
wealthiest americans with lower capital gains rates for people who 
profit from sales of stocks real estate and other investments 
bush trying to put the pressure on lawmakers said the meter 
is running but look i cant dictate to congress 
his hypothetical package would increase the top rate on the 
highestincome people from 28 percent to 31 percent ease the top 
rate from 33 percent to 31 percent for some 45 million slightly 
less welltodo taxpayers and chop the rate on capital gains from 
28 percent to 15 percent 
that would do away with the bubble in the tax code under 
which some upper middleincome taxpayers now pay a higher rate than 
the wealthiest 
the white house held out the proposal as the outer limit of 
bushs willingness to compromise on taxes of some democratic 
proposals to raise the top rate to a flat 33 percent bush said 
i cannot accept that 
thursdays proposal by the ways and means committee democrats 
which they plan to offer on the house floor next week would indeed 
raise the top rate for the richest americans to 33 percent and 
people earning more than 1 million annually would also pay a 10 
percent tax surcharge 
in addition cuts to medicare beneficiaries would total 10 
billion over the next five years down from the 28 billion budget 
summit negotiators agreed to last month and 7 billion less than 
the full ways and means committee agreed to wednesday 
bushs budget director richard g darman told a senate panel 
that the administration had privately proposed coupling a 31 
percent top tax rate with a capitalgains cut last month but had 
been turned down by democrats 
its my personal opinion that its not negotiable on 
satisfactory terms on both sides darman told the senate 
governmental affairs committee there just isnt a deal there 
the developments came in a day of damage control at the white 
house as bush and his lieutenants sought to counter an impression 
of presidential indecisiveness on the continuing budget impasse 
the president presented his case in three separate white house 
meetings on thursday with house republicans 
at a picturetaking session at the outset of one of them bush 
said he was open to suggestions but had little flexibility on the 
size of a tax increase he could tolerate 
thus he said he wasnt eager to press congress to accept a plan 
with a 31 percent top rate and a 15 percent capital gains rate i 
think its a waste of time because i just dont think it can get 
through both houses of congress bush said 
the white house efforts to clarify bushs position did little to 
end the budget stalemate on capitol hill 
and they were initially accompanied by more of the same 
confusion that has reigned for the past few days on the subject 
rep bill archer rtexas a senior republican on the 
taxwriting house ways and means committee emerged from a white 
house meeting announcing that the president was ready to endorse 
the 31percent top rate 15percent capital gains plan 
he is willing and i think hell speak to you today about 
this to equalize the level at 31 percent archer said his 
comments were quickly followed by a statement from white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater seeming to rule out pushing any 
such plan 
fitzwater said bush believed that pursuing it in the current 
context may not only fail it may legitimize something farther to 
the left that we cannot accept in other words a top rate above 
31 percent 
among details congress is working on the house ways and means 
committee voted wednesday night to eliminate a heatingoil tax that 
was included in the budget bill voted down last week and to reduce 
the proposed increase in premiums that retirees pay for medicare 
coverage of doctors bills 
the medicare premium now 2860 a month would rise gradually 
to 4650 under the ways and means version the annual 75 
deductible that beneficiaries pay for hospital care before medicare 
starts paying would be raised to 100 next year and to 125 in 
1992 
in addition many tourists entering the united states as well as 
railroads and ship lines would face higher costs under other parts 
of the giant deficitreduction bill congress is piecing together

former president alan garcia appeared on 
thursday before a congressional committee that will decide whether 
he should face criminal charges for his role in the 1986 massacre 
of about 250 rebel prisoners 
as a former president and a lifetime member of the senate 
garcia cannot be prosecuted in criminal court unless the committee 
decides to revoke his immunity 
upon leaving the hearing garcia said he would ask that his 
immunity be lifted he said he hopes to submit myself like any 
other common ordinary citizen to common justice 
a second congressional panel is investigating charges that 
garcia used government funds to buy houses 
most political analysts still regard garcia as the favorite to 
be elected president in 1995 no other strong political figure is 
in sight they say 
as chief of the centerleft aprista party government from 1985 
to 1990 garcia presided over perus worst economic crisis his 
term in office was also marked by increased rebel violence 
under the constitution garcia was ineligible to run for 
reelection in this years presidential elections won by alberto 
fujimori 
a number of congressmen especially from leftist parties say 
garcia should share responsibility for the massacre in june 1986 
when soldiers and police put down riots in three lima prisons most 
of those killed were members of the maoistoriented shining path 
rebel movement 
garcia publicly criticized lower ranking members of the security 
forces for summarily executing dozens of prisoners after they 
surrendered he says he and the military chiefs of staff at the 
time of the massacre are guiltless 
fujimori also had problems with congress on thursday it 
prevented him from attending a summit of latin american leaders in 
caracas venezuela 
prime minister juan hurtado miller said fujimori abandoned plans 
for the trip after the government was unable to convene a special 
session of congress thursday afternoon 
the constitution says congress must approve all foreign travel 
by a president if a president leaves without such approval he 
forfeits his office 
fujimoris wife susana was to travel to caracas instead hurtado 
said 
he said foreign minister luis marchand stens will represent peru 
at the meetings

the ozone hole over the south pole this year 
is almost as severe as the record levels recorded in 1987 two 
federal agencies announced thursday 
scientists at both the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration and the national aeronautics and space 
administration said that the depletion of ozone over the pole 
reached a low point for the year last tuesday 
noaa measurements taken by balloon released from a south polar 
station showed that ozone at 9 to 11 miles altitude dropped to 15 
parts per billion less than 1 percent of normal normal 
concentration is 2000 parts per billion 
for the atmosphere as a whole above the station ozone 
concentration was 50 percent of normal nearly equaling the lowest 
level previously recorded on oct 9 1987 
a nasa satellite measurement made a similar finding the space 
agency said 
ozone in the upper atmosphere is important because the compound 
acts as a shield against ultraviolet radiation from the sun uv 
radiation can cause skin cancer and is harmful to some plants 
scientists believe the earths ozone belt is being erroded by the 
action of chlorine and some other molecules that come from 
industrial pollution the ozone layer over the south pole thins 
severely each september and october creating what scientists 
called an ozone hole 
noaa scientists said that ozone in the air over the south pole 
is normally at 260 dobson units a measure used for ozone 
concentrations last tuesday the measurement dropped to 130 dobson 
units noaa spokesman william j brennan said that the record low 
recorded on oct 9 1987 is 126 dobson units 
sam oltmans a noaa physicist in boulder colo said the ozone 
depletion over the south pole has been following a pattern of 
dipping more severely every other year with the low points coming 
on the odd years 
the low registered on tuesday is a change in this pattern but 
oltmans said it is unclear if the ozone depletion is trending 
toward a new permanently lower level or not 
the pattern has changed for the first time but this was 
predicted because of a circulation pattern in the air currents 
said oltmans 
he said the ozone hole in 1991 may revert to the alternateyear 
pattern that has been observed since 1979

christian heartland 
hours earlier aouns command said his air defenses fired on an 
unidentified jet fighter that streaked over his headquarters at the 
presidential palace 
police said a dozen columns of syrian t62 tanks and thousands 
of soldiers moved up to combat positions to support president elias 
hrawis army along a fivemile front from southern beirut to the 
central mountains east of the capital 
most of the buildup was shaping up under parachute flares at the 
tiro district in beiruts shiite moslem southern slums and at the 
druseinhabited suburb of kfarshima four miles farther southeast 
france was making an 11thhour mediation bid to persuade aoun to 
abandon the palace and leave for paris to form a 
governmentinexile there a hrawi government source said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the source said french ambassador rene ala was in radio contact 
with aoun urging him to leave and spare lebanon another 
bloodbath 
if and when ambassador ala tells us his effort failed our 
forces backed by the syrian army will attack he said he 
mentioned no deadline 
several beirut radio stations announced they were extending 
their broadcast beyond the regular midnight closing hour to report 
developments 
aouns radio station broadcast a communique instructing 
inhabitants of his enclave home for 150000 christians to ring 
church bells all night to protest what looks like an imminent 
military thrust 
an earlier aoun communique said a warplane flew through the 
free area over the presidential palace at midafternoon and was 
confronted by antiaircraft fire 
radio stations of rival christian warlord samir geageas 
lebanese forces militia said two syrian mig17 jets made two 
reconnaissance runs over the hilltop palace at suburban baabda 
east of beirut and then flew eastward toward neighboring syria 
the reported overflight heightened fears that hrawis mainly 
moslem army was poised to attack with syrian backing to dislodge 
aoun 
the syrians maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league mandate to end the 15yearold civil war between moslems and 
christians 
syrian forces have rarely scrambled jets in lebanons airspace 
they apparently fear a clash with the israeli air force which 
dominates and routinely patrols lebanese skies to film guerrilla 
activities of palestinian and proiranian shiite fundamentalist 
factions 
for the last three weeks 20000 hrawi troops and syrian 
soldiers have ringed aouns 80squaremile bastion in a bid to 
starve the maverick general into submission 
aoun has vowed to fight unto death if attacked 
the syrianaligned hrawi fired aoun as army commander and 
interim prime minister last november when hrawi was elected 
president by parliament to enforce a peace plan brokered by the 
arab league to end the civil war 
but aoun rejected hrawis presidency aoun has been holding out 
with 15000 troops most of them christians in part of christian 
east beirut and the adjoining metn mountains including the 
traditional seat of power in baabda 
hrawi aoun and geagea are maronite catholics the largest 
christian sect that held power in lebanon after it gained 
independence from france in 1943

a mistrial was declared thursday for a defendant 
in the bensonhurst racial slaying after a juror was dismissed for 
screaming across the courtroom at the victims father 
state supreme court justice thaddeus owens the trial judge 
said charles stresslers criminal trial could not continue without 
12 jurors the alternate jurors in the case had been dismissed 
wednesday when deliberations began 
the defendant cannot waive a constitutional right owens 
said the only alternative i have is to declare a mistrial 
earlier after juror lydia bermudez told the judge that she 
could not remain impartial and he dismissed her both defense and 
prosecution lawyers agreed to proceed with deliberations and accept 
judgment from the remaining 11 jurors 
however late thursday owens called the lawyers back to the 
courtroom and said he had learned state law prohibited fewer than 
12 jurors in a criminal case 
stressler will go on trial again jan 17 when a codefendant is 
scheduled to be tried on an assault charge court officials said 
of those charged in the bensonhurst attack one has been convicted 
of murder and two of lesser charges and four still face murder 
trials 
ms bermudez outburst occurred shortly before noon after the 
jury had heard about an hours worth of readback of stresslers 
trial testimony 
she began screaming at moses stewart the father of murder 
victim yusuf hawkins 
what are you looking at she yelled at stewart sitting in 
the second row of seats in the courtrooms spectator section 
shes talking to me he asked 
youve been doing that to me every day you know what im 
talking about youve been doing it every day she shouted 
back at stewart 
after a few moments of silence in the stunned courtroom owens 
called the lawyers and ms bermudez into his chambers to discuss 
how to handle the problem a pool of two reporters were allowed 
into the discussions 
with the judge and lawyers out of the courtroom and the jurors 
watching stewart stood up and walked toward the door mumbling 
angrily 
if she cant stand the father of the victim looking at her 
get her out of here i look at everybody on the jury i dont 
care who she is i look at everybody on the jury 
in chambers stresslers lawyer jacob b evseroff moved for 
dismissal of the indictment mistrial or stewarts exclusion from 
the courtroom 
owens denied all three motions 
ms bermudez told owens she felt intimidated by stewart and 
asserted i dont need this aggravation from this freaking 
lowlife 
yesterday he had everybody staring at me i dont need 
this i dont need nobody staring at me she told the judge and 
lawyers 
owens sent ms bermudez out to join the other jurors and called 
in stewart to hear his side 
yesterday i felt the same way he said i felt she has 
been trying to get into a staring contest with me im looking at 
everybody not just her 
he said that as thevictims father he had a right to sit in on 
all of the proceedings 
i cant exclude him from the courtroom the judge said 
his argument is as compelling as hers well see which one stares 
the other one down 
when the reading back of testimony resumed stewart returned to 
the courtroom for a few minutes but quickly left 
ms bermudez slumped in her chair one hand hiding her face 
outside the courtroom during the lunch recess prosecutors 
refused to comment 
i have never in 42 years ever seen anything like this 
evseroff said 
the panel began deliberating the case late wednesday 
stressler 22 is accused of murder manslaughter riot and 
other crimes in the aug 23 1989 slaying of hawkins a 
16yearold black shot through the chest when he and three friends 
crossed paths with a mob of young whites in brooklyns bensonhurst

an offer of free potatoes for anyone who helps 
gather them has enticed thousands of city dwellers into the fields 
and reduced the chances of hunger this winter soviet officials 
said thursday 
two weeks ago newspapers and television broadcasts warned that 
the harvest was proceeding very slowly and moscow had stockpiled 
only 7 percent of the potatoes it would need to get through the 
winter 
fear of hunger spread through the capital and consumers emptied 
grocery shelves stashing sacks of potatoes in closets and 
basements 
since then emergency measures including ordering soldiers 
into the fields and offering to let volunteers keep half the 
potatoes they dig up has doubled and even tripled the rate of the 
harvest in many areas according to official reports 
true the weather has brightened up a bit but the main thing 
is the massive turnout of voluntary helpers gennady kulik 
deputy prime minister of the russian republic said on the main 
television news program vremya 
vremya reported 160000 moscow residents including 40000 
soldiers were working in the fields it showed city dwellers 
pulling potatoes from the soil and placing them in buckets one 
for the state then one for themselves 
the tv report appeared aimed at reducing the crisis atmosphere 
as the country heads into winter amid economic confusion and 
shortages of many essential goods ranging from gasoline to 
sausage tobacco and paper 
after weeks of debate the national legislature is still trying 
to reach consensus on a plan to switch from central planning to a 
marketbased system president mikhail s gorbachev initially 
endorsed a radical 500day plan then hesitated on whether to allow 
private ownership of farms which he said should be decided by a 
national referendum 
thursdays upbeat tv broadcast said 75 percent of the soviet 
unions potato plantations have been harvested and 4050 percent 
of the planned allocation has been sent to industrial centers 
kulik said several cities including chelyabinsk sverdlovsk and 
perm already have filled their vegetable storage facilities and 
are fully provisioned for winter 
he said moscow has nearly finished stockpiling beets and is 
likely to get more carrots than planned the city also has received 
50000 of the 165000 tons of cabbage it is expected to use during 
the winter and the cabbage harvest is going well he said 
the tv report did not say what percentage of moscows potato 
allocation was in hand but kulik said deliveries were arriving 
from across russia the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
and measures are being taken to fully provide the capital with 
potatoes 
a bumper crop of wheat also is being harvested but much of it 
is expected to rot or go to waste because of poor transportation 
and inefficient bakeries 
last month bread was in short supply in moscow for the first 
time since the early 1960s a crash program to raise bakers wages 
and put bakeries back in operation eliminated the bread lines 
within weeks

the senate appropriations committee approved a 
268 billion defense bill thursday that leaves intact president 
bushs 1991 budget request for the b2 stealth bomber 
by voice vote the panel adopted the legislation after turning 
aside an attempt by sen patrick leahy dvt to stop production 
of the b2 at six planes 
the greatest threat to our national security is not the soviet 
union it is our spiraling debt leahy told his colleagues the 
lawmaker also pointed to an air force review that found widespread 
problems with the aircrafts manufacturer the northrop corp 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii and chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee on defense argued that the measure would result in 
the united states spending 3 billion on an unfinished science 
project 
the bill largely tracks the steps taken in august by the senate 
when it approved separate legislation that outlined ceilings on 
defense spending for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the committee bill which would appropriate actual funds trims 
about 1 billion from bushs 47 billion budget request for the 
strategic defense initiative cuts troop strength by 100000 and 
provides 51 billion for two b2 bombers in 1991 and components 
for more bombers in 1992 
the measure includes 238 million for the v22 osprey tiltrotor 
aircraft but not the 165 million in procurement money the house 
included for the program bush has proposed canceling 
the committee also adopted by voice vote an amendment 
restricting the way the administration can spend money on specific 
programs within sdi commonly known as star wars 
leahy is expected to bring up the b2 amendment again when the 
full senate takes up the defense spending plan possibly as early 
as friday 
nevertheless the panels action was welcome news to sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee and a 
b2 proponent 
thatll help thatll help were hanging on by stealthy 
fingers nunn said of the vote 
earlier in the day air force secretary donald rice pleaded with 
congress not to decide the fate of the b2 based on the air force 
review 
it would be both inappropriate and unwise to use the review 
rice told the senate armed services committee at a 
hastilyscheduled hearing weapon systems must continue to be 
judged on the basis of the threat 
seeking to repair the damage to the b2 bomber program from air 
force testimony earlier this week on major problems at northrop 
nunn summoned rice before the panel to discuss the services 
review 
on tuesday brig gen robert w drewes who led the eightman 
team that conducted the study told a house panel that northrop was 
beset by problems in nearly every aspect of its business 
drewes identified weaknesses in systems engineering the 
transition from research and development to production software 
management subcontract management organization and personnel and 
business systems which includes cost and schedule estimates 
the review did not delve into problems associated with ongoing 
federal probes of the los angelesbased company northrop pleaded 
guilty in february to 34 counts of fraud and was fined 17 million 
the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense contractor 
the plea stems from charges that northrop falsified reports on 
the airlaunched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the 
harrier av8b jet

sen donald riegles campaign committee paid a 
troubled california savings and loan 5000 this year for catering 
services provided at a 1987 fundraiser an aide said thursday 
federal law prohibits corporations from donating to candidates 
for federal offices services are considered inkind or 
nonmonetary donations 
they also are required to be listed in campaign finance reports 
riegles campaign did not report the catering services paid for by 
columbia savings and loan until this year 
david krawitz riegles administrative assistant said the 
senators political organization did not receive an invoice for the 
california fundraiser until late in 1989 
it was our understanding that the bills had been paid 
krawitz said when we were informed otherwise the reimbursement 
was made 
columbia savings and loan chairman thomas spiegel put the costs 
on his company expense account the detroit news reported spiegel 
resigned from columbia last year in the wake of accusations that he 
used the thrifts money for personal expenses 
he is a close associate of michael milken the junkbond pioneer 
who has pleaded guilty to securities fraud violations and is 
awaiting sentencing 
a spokesman for the federal elections commission said he could 
not comment on whether the riegle fundraiser was financed in 
violation of the law 
the spokesman scott moxley also declined to say whether the 
fec would investigate the matter 
krawitz said it was his understanding that riegles campaign 
complied with the law by paying the invoice promptly after 
receiving it 
riegle was not aware of who paid for the catering services and 
has done nothing to benefit columbia krawitz said the banking 
committee handles legislation affecting the thrift industry 
the fundraiser was hosted by the california league of savings 
insttutions krawitz said 
riegle who became chairman of the senate banking committee in 
1989 collected 25000 in donations for his 1988 reelection 
campaign at the fundraiser 
he is one of five senators whose ties to another thrift 
lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif are the subject of an 
ethics committee investigation that thrifts former chairman 
charles keating jr faces 42 counts of defrauding investors in the 
nations biggest sampl failure expected to cost taxpayers 2

administration officials sought to reassure 
friends of israel on capitol hill thursday as a senator introduced 
a resolution to disallow most of a 75 billion package of new 
weapons for saudi arabia 
we must not become the unwitting arms supplier for a new arab 
war of annihilation against israel said sen alan cranston 
dcalif 
cranston introduced a bill that would forbid president bush to 
sell advanced m1a2 tanks apache attack helicopters 
multiplelaunch rocket systems and tow 2 missile launchers to the 
saudis 
the sale of those items as well as bradley fighting vehicles 
patriot antimissile missiles tanker planes trucks and 
communications gear was proposed last month to help counter the 
threat posed by iraq whose troops are dug in along the border with 
saudi arabia following their conquest of kuwait 
at the same time administration officials briefed members of 
the house foreign affairs committee on what the united states is 
prepared to do for israel to counterbalance the saudi sale 
the administration already has said it will provide patriot 
antimissile batteries for israel and is believed ready to provide 
advanced aircraft as well officials are looking at creative 
financing to make it possible for israel to get the new equipment 
without paying for it said rep mel levine dcalif 
i would prefer not to see us go down this path with either of 
them levine said we should be pushing regional arms control 
but if the president is determined to sell these weapons to the 
saudis and the saudis are determined to have them we must also 
provide israel with items needed to maintain its qualitative 
military edge 
levine said he would withhold until next week a decision on 
whether to oppose the saudi sale

the senate voted thursday to begin paying 
nearly half a billion dollars in past dues to the united nations 
withheld in recent years because of congressional opposition to its 
practices 
reflecting an aboutface prompted by the uns sponsorhip of a 
trade embargo against iraq the measure was included as part of a 
196 billion money bill approved by a 917 vote 
president bush last january had requested 93 million as a 20 
percent first installment on a fiveyear plan to pay off the 464 
million in us dues arrearages 
but lawmakers had shown no inclination to go along with it until 
the uns sharp response to iraqs invasion of kuwait in august 
and subsequent taking of american and other foreign hostages 
in addition to the 93 million in past dues the bill includes 
31 million to cover us arrearages for supporting un 
peacekeeping forces in addition to the 91 million as the american 
share for their support in the current fiscal year 
also to support the military effort against iraqi president 
suddam hussein the bill adds 79 million for activating another 
five ships in the us ready reserve force for deployment to the 
persian gulf already 41 ships in the 96ship fleet have been put 
on active duty and sent to the region 
the bill which finances the operation of the justice state and 
commerce departments for the fiscal year that began oct 1 also 
triples to 1625 million bushs request for investigating and 
prosecuting savings and loan fraud 
the president and the attorney general just dont place a 
priority on these sampl criminals said sen fritz hollings 
dsc they spend a fortune arranging stings but they have been 
stung more than 1300 times and dont do anything about it

iraqi authorities in a further tightening of 
restrictions apparently have ruled that no american men 55 years 
and older will be allowed to depart iraqicontrolled territory the 
state department said thursday 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler also described as 
simply outrageous iraqi treatment of americans and foreignborn 
family members who left iraq and kuwait on wednesday aboard a 
uschartered evacuation flight 
aboard the flight were 321 persons including 270 us citizens 
and their foreignborn family members 
in a message to americans still in iraq and kuwait broadcast 
over the voice of america the state department said no more 
charter flights were scheduled 
however we will continue to assist with the travel 
arrangements for all us citizens and thir foreignborn family 
members who want to depart and are allowed to do so the 
broadcast said 
the message again urged americans to keep a low profile and 
exercise caution and concluded your release is of the utmost 
importance we will not stop our efforts to gain your freedom until 
the last american is home 
ms tutwiler said iraqi authorities interrogated and harassed 
the departing passengers both at a kuwait city hotel and at a 
checkpoint en route to the airport in basra forcing lengthy 
delays 
some evacuees said they were threatened with weapons a dozen 
people who signed up for the flight were prevented by the iraqis 
from leaving she said 
the delays forced a postponement from thursday to friday in the 
passengers arrival at raleighdurham airport in north carolina 
the passengers spent the day thursday in london 
virtually all the departing americans were women and children 
ms tutwiler said us officials have received reports that men 
over age 55 are now being prevented from leaving she said previous 
indications were that americans males of that age were exempted by 
iraqi authorities along with those under 18 
she declined to give estimates of the number of americans left 
in iraq and kuwait 
other officials said however there were somewhat more than 100 
americans on the flight most from kuwait based on department 
estimates dating back to last month that would leave perhaps 775 
to 925 in the two countries taking into account wednesdays 
departures 
about 104 are being detained and the remainder are the targets 
of housetohouse searches by iraqi soldiers

wisconsins chippewa indians cannot sue the 
state for an estimated 300 million in damages resulting from their 
being denied hunting and fishing rights for more than a century a 
federal judge ruled thursday 
the tribes only hope to collect damages rests in persuading the 
federal government to sue the state on behalf of the chippewa us 
district judge barbara crabb said citing recent supreme court 
interpretations of the us constitutions 11th amendment 
the supreme courts analysis leaves the plaintiff tribes 
without an adequate remedy for the wrongs they have suffered 
crabb said 
the 11th amendment gives states sovereign immunity from 
lawsuits by tribes and other foreign nations 
i find this wholly at odds with the principle that federal 
law operates to provide individuals with relief for deprivations of 
their rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution 
and laws caused by state actors she said 
the federal government was unlikel to join the case she said 
the ruling reversed a 1984 district court decision that the 
tribe could sue the state based on a federal law designed to help 
tribes resolve treaty disputes 
the lawsuit was to have been tried last month but was postponed 
by crabb her ruling dismisses the claims 
earl charlton an attorney for the mole lake chippewa band 
described the ruling as a minor setback and said the tribe would 
appeal 7th us circuit court of appeals in chicago 
the state still has to resolve this matter the decision 
certainly doesnt address the merits of the case he said this 
doesnt vindicate the past actions of the state of wisconsin in 
violating tribal rights 
republican gov tommy thompson and other state officials were 
delighted with the decision 
the ruling confirmed that wisconsin is not responsible for any 
damages regarding the exercise of the indians treaty rights 
thompson said 
under 19th century treaties ceding indian territory to the us 
government wisconsins six chippewa bands retain the right to 
spear fish hunt and cut timber off reservations on 23929 square 
miles of public land in northern wisconsin 
since a court affirmed those rights in 1983 the chippewa have 
encountered huge and sometimes violent protests by nonindians who 
claim the treaty rights give the states 4000 chippewas an unfair 
edge and threaten to deplete fish and timber 
thursdays ruling is the second setback this year in the 16year 
court battle with the state over treaty issues 
in may crabb reversed another ruling that had allowed the tribe 
100 percent of the safe allowable harvest of resources on ceded 
lands 
she ruled that the resources be shared equally between the state 
and tribe 
efforts to negotiate settlements with two of the most active 
spearfishing bands of chippewa were defeated by the tribe last 
year 
those agreements would have provided the tribes millions of 
dollars over 10 years if the tribes curtailed some of their treaty 
rights

a case that hinged on whether a 28weekold 
fetus was covered by the mothers insurance has been settled by a 
850000 payment to the family 
american global insurance co had appealed a 1 million judgment 
in favor of sharon and andre bonte and their daughter stephanie 
to the state supreme court 
the case is believed to be only the second of its kind to have 
reached a state supreme court in a similar case in 1981 the 
alabama supreme court ruled that the phrase resident of the same 
household was ambiguous and ruled for the family 
sharon bonte gave birth the day after she was struck by a car 
while walking in manchester in june 1988 the bontes said that as a 
result of the accident stephanie now 2 was born with cerebral 
palsy a nervous disorder usually caused by damage to the brain 
before or during birth 
andrew dunn american globals lawyer said the settlement 
reached last week averted two other lawsuits 
one on behalf of stephanie would have charged sharon bonte 
with negligence for crossing the street where there was no 
crosswalk dunn said the other would have sued new hampshire 
insurance co american globals sister company and sharon bontes 
employer as a landowner because the accident happened in front 
of its offices he said 
more than 850000 was involved dunn said the settlement 
in this case also dealt with some issues that may come up in 
connection with those two threatened claims 
the bontes lawyer thomas craig did not immediately return 
calls thursday when the supreme court was to have heard oral 
arguments 
in briefs filed with the high court craig had argued that the 
fetus was a member of the bonte household and should have been 
covered under the policy which covers relatives who are 
residents of the same household 
but dunn said the usual meaning of relative doesnt include 
a fetus in the womb 
its a contractual issue its not an issue of whether the 
fetus is a person of whether the fetus is alive of when life 
begins he said its not an issue of any cosmic importance 
its not a philosophical issue 
lawyers agreed the case was unrelated to abortion because it did 
not consider whether a feuus has legal rights generally only 
whether it qualified as a resident under the insurance companys 
definition

sponsors of a civil rights bill designed to 
combat job discrimination made lastminute concessions to the bush 
administration thursday in a move to save the measure from a 
threatened presidential veto 
critics said however president bush still appeared poised to 
reject the bill on grounds that it would usher in minority hiring 
quotas 
at least in my contacts with the administration they think 
this socalled compromise does more harm than good declared rep 
harris fawell rill a leading critic as sponsors overhauled the 
legislation 
the bill would overturn six supreme court decisions last year 
and has been the top item on the civil rights movements priority 
list in recent months 
major provisions would reshape complex courtroom procedures in a 
way that would make it harder for employers to defend themselves in 
lawsuits alleging discrimination in the workplace 
other provisions range from a ban on racial harassment on the 
job to a obstacles to reopening courtapproved minority hiring 
agreements 
the bush administration has been saying the bill would make it 
so hard for employers to win discrimination suits that they would 
turn to hiring quotas as a way of protecting themselves in advance 
from such charges 
a housesenate conference committee that had already produced a 
compromise version of the bill went back to work thursday night and 
adopted a sevenpoint package of concessions designed to win bushs 
backing 
even if bush remains opposed supporters said the changes might 
attract enough support for the bill to override the threatened 
veto 
the core of the concession package would offer employers greater 
leeway in defending against discrimination suits it also would 
make clear that nothing in the bill was designed to encourage the 
use of hiring quotas 
the package was adopted 118 by the conference committee 
rep craig washington dtexas who had supported earlier 
versions of the bill voted with critics against it he said the 
changes turned the measure into the hollow shell of a civil 
rights bill 
he said long delays in sending the bill to the white house most 
likely will enable bush to stop the bill with a pocket veto if he 
so desires 
under a pocket veto a president is able to kill bills by simply 
refusing to sign them when congress is not in session lawmakers 
are getting ready to leave washington and get in a round of 
campaigning before november elections 
im not criticizing them theyre senators and stuff 
washington said nodding toward sen edward m kennedy dmass 
but we could have done this three weeks ago 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif also a supporter of earlier 
versions of the bill said it was time to come up with something 
we hope is more in line with the presidents views 
peter lunnie head of the fair employment coalition a business 
group critical of the bill said after the conference committee met 
that it appeared bush would not be swayed by the changes 
he said there was a white house meeting last week at which 
sen orrin hatch rutah was told point blank the language was 
unacceptable to the president and they would recommend that he 
bush veto this bill 
lunnie said hatch received that message at the meeting from 
white house counsel boyden gray and attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
civil rights advocate william taylor said after the conference 
committee meeting however that it still was not fully clear that 
bush would wield his veto pen when the bill reached his desk 
everybody has heard it from boyden gray some people have 
heard it from thornburgh but nobody has heard it from bush 
taylor said 
rep hamilton fish rny said earlier it was unclear whether 
bush would approve the fresh version 
fish said the decision to go ahead with the lastminute 
concessions represented a recognition by the civil rights movement 
that the choice now was between winning bushs support or coming 
away emptyhanded and refighting the battle next year 
in a sense they have watered down their work product he 
said

the soviet ruble will be devalued by about 70 
percent in relation to the dollar under soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic reform program a soviet economic official 
said thursday 
ivan ivanov deputy chairman of the state foreign economic 
commission said the new exchange rate for international commercial 
transactions would be 18 rubles per 1 compared with the current 
56 ruble to the dollar 
the official news agency tass quoted ivanov as telling a 
legislative committee that the new rate would be introduced by 
presidential decree 
tass did not say when the devaluation would take effect but it 
said the rate was calculated on the basis of new soviet wholesale 
prices that are scheduled to become effective jan 1 
the new rate will make exports more profitable for soviet 
producers and facilitate the streamlining and restriction of 
imports which have been growing rapidly since soviet enterprises 
were granted the right of free access to the foreign market tass 
said 
the chairman of the soviet state bank viktor gerashchenko had 
said this week a devaluation was likely 
gorbachevs economic plan which envisions a gradual switch from 
central planning to a marketbased economy is under consideration 
by a committee of economists and politicians appointed by the 
supreme soviet the committee is scheduled to issue a report by 
oct 15 after which the plan could be approved by the national 
legislature 
lawmakers already have voted to give gorbachev emergency powers 
to make the transition to a market and he has begun issuing 
decrees 
ivanov said the devaluation would not affect the exchange rate 
for tourists converting dollars to rubles at soviet banks that 
rate would remain at 6 rubles to the dollar he said 
unlike most countries currencies whose exchange rates 
fluctuate with free trading on international markets the rubles 
rate is set artificially by the soviet government on the black 
market a dollar can fetch 15 to 30 rubles

democrats on the house ways and means 
committee began writing their own budget plan thursday stuffing it 
with higher taxes for the rich and easing the burden other 
deficitreduction proposals put on the poor and the middle class 
the plan is the most liberal of the burgeoning number of budget 
proposals floating around capitol hill democrats insisted they 
wanted to reverse the trends of a decade in which they said the 
poor got poorer 
contrary to what you hear doing something to reverse this 
deplorable trend is not preaching class warfare said ways and 
means chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
the new proposal would impose a top 33 percent income tax 
bracket on the wealthiest americans ending the current bubble 
in which the top bracket drops from 33 percent to 28 percent 
the rich would have to pay a 10 percent surtax on any income 
surpassing 1 million the minimum tax the wealthy pay after all 
exemptions and deductions now 21 percent would be increased to 25 
percent 
the full ways and means committee adopted a separate plan on 
wednesday containing none of those increases that plan the 
democratic proposal and a republican alternative are expected to be 
debated on the house floor next week 
in the senate finance committee meanwhile chairman lloyd 
bentsen dtexas continued reshaping his proposal in an effort to 
attract bipartisan support 
for example the latest version would limit itemized deductions 
of people with incomes over 100000 a year raise to 125000 the 
maximum amount of annual wages subject to the tax that finances 
medicare and allow monthly premiums paid by medicare beneficiaries 
to rise more slowly than negotiators had proposed 
rostenkowski said democrats were still discussing whether to put 
a cut in the capital gains tax in the package he said if it were 
included it would be less generous than what the white house 
wants bush has said he wants the top rate on capital gains taxes 
levied on profits from the sale of assets dropped to 15 percent 
currently capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary 
income 
under the democratic plan the gasoline tax would be increased 
by 3 cents per gallon that is 8 cents less than the full committee 
proposal and 9 cents less than president bush and congressional 
leaders agreed to during their budget summit the federal tax on 
gasoline is now 9 cents per gallon 
the democrats would limit cuts to medicare beneficiaries to 10 
billion over the next five year that would be 7 billion less than 
the full committees proposal and 18 billion below the budget 
summit agreement 
as a result the democrats would boost the monthly premium 
medicare beneficiaries pay for doctors coverage now 2860 to 
2990 next year and 4620 in 1995 
in addition the democratic proposal would increase the current 
75 annual deductible beneficiaries pay for doctors expenses to 
100 below the full committee and budget summit proposals 
the democratic proposal would also 
increase from 51300 to 100000 the ceiling on annual 
earnings from which the 145 percent medicare tax is deducted the 
full committee raised the amount to 73000 
drop the 2 percent tax on petroleum fuels the budget summit had 
produced 
include many elements of the full committees plan such as a 
10 percent tax on private planes and other luxury items and a 
doubling of the 16cent tax on sixpacks of beer 
the top income tax bracket now drops from 33 percent to 28 
percent at 162770 taxable income for a childless married couple 
filing a joint return and at 97620 for a single taxpayer the 
democratic proposal would extend the 33 percent bracket to include 
all additional taxable income above these bracket points

the house on thursday rebuffed conservative 
demands for strict new antiobscenity curbs on the national 
endowment for the arts and voted overwhelmingly to let the courts 
decide whether federally subsidized arts projects are obscene 
after an emotional fivehour debate the house approved a 
bipartisan compromise sponsored by reps pat williams dmont and 
e thomas coleman rmo that would penalize grant recipients if 
they are subsequently convicted of violating obscenity laws 
passage of the williamscoleman measure on a 38242 roll call 
vote signaled a major reversal of congressional sentiment on the 
politically explosive issue of federal support for art that some 
lawmakers consider offensive 
a year ago in the heat of a controversy over support for 
exhibitions of works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist 
andres serrano congress approved explicit antiobscenity 
restrictions on the endowment at the urging of sen jesse helms 
rnc 
on thursday the house rejected even more stringent curbs 
proposed by rep dana rohrabacher rcalif and overwhelmingly 
defeated a separate proposal to abolish the 171 million federal 
arts agency altogether 
williams told reporters the houses resounding approval of the 
compromise bill was a bigger victory in favor of tolerance and 
freedom of expression than i had expected he predicted it would 
make it easier for the senate to resist pressure from helms and his 
allies for new restrictions on the endowment 
like a similar measure awaiting senate floor action the house 
bill would scrap the current helms restrictions on the endowment 
and rely on the courts to make determinations of obscenity 
the house bill also would renew the endowments statutory 
authority for three years and order reforms in its grantmaking 
procedures with the aim of making the endowments decisions more 
responsive to the interests of the taxpaying public 
at the request of republican negotiators the bill provides an 
increase in the share of grants allocated to state arts agencies 
from 20 percent to 35 percent over three years 
the house planned to vote friday on a separate appropriations 
bill that would boost the endowments budget from 171 million to 
180 million in the current fiscal year 
that bill approved by the house appropriations committee omits 
any content restrictions on works subsidized by the endowment it 
also would order endowment chairman john e frohnmayer to scrap a 
controversial requirement that grant recipients sign an 
antiobscenity pledge before they can receive federal money 
before it approved the compromise bill the house voted 249175 
to defeat rohrabachers proposal to prohibit support for works that 
depict sexually explicit conduct or sexual exploitation of 
children attack religion defile the american flag or include an 
actual human embryo or fetus 
house members also buried 36164 a proposal by rep philip m 
crane rill to abolish the agency because of its past support 
for what crane called obnoxious perverted and sick arts 
projects 
rohrabacher warned his colleagues that the american people are 
watching this debate on television implying that house members 
who opposed his amendment would face the wrath of voters in the 
nov 6 congressional elections 
he said the compromise bill was a fraudulent political fig 
leaf that would do nothing to halt the flow of offensive art 
allegedly subsidized by the arts endowment 
liberal lawmakers denounced rohrabachers tough proposed 
crackdown as a possibly unconstitutional attempt to intimidate 
artists and squelch freedom of expression 
williams said rohrabachers proposal was copperriveted 
ironclad censorship of the first degree rep james scheuer 
dny called it an offensive and misguided measure 
but rohrabacher won support from several conservatives 
including rep ron marlenee rmont 
its a fix that allows the junkies to continue to peddle 
their depraved sadistic wares with impunity said marlenee who 
may be fighting the liberal williams in 1992 for the single montana 
house seat expected to emerge from redistricting based on the 1990 
census 
under the compromise a grant recipient convicted of violating 
obscenity statutes would be required to give the government its 
money back the original bill would have barred a guilty artist 
from receiving further nea grants for three years but the house 
voted to allow the artist to apply for a new grant as soon as the 
nea had been repaid 
the bill says that obscenity shall not be funded by the 
endowment the current ban forbids the nea to support any works 
that may be considered obscene including depictions of 
homosexual or sadomasochistic activities and the sexual 
exploitation of children 
before debate rohrabacher denounced the williamscoleman bill 
as a fraud that would open the door to federal subsidies for 
anything no matter how freakish pornographic or sacrilegious 
that an nea panel would approve 
rohrabacher announced the support of 20 conservative groups 
including phyllis schlaflys eagle forum pat robertsons christian 
coalition and the rev donald wildmons american family 
association for his amendment to impose specific antiobscenity 
restrictions on the arts endowment 
when the house takes up the money bill friday rep ralph 
regula rohio plans to introduce a floor amendment that would 
forbid support for obscene or indecent works as defined by the 
supreme court and the federal communications commission 
regulas proposal says the endowment chairman shall ensure that 
federal supported works are sensitive to the nature of public 
sponsorship respect general standards of decency and are 
appropriate for a general audience

the maharishi mahesh yogi said thursday 
his solution to the persian gulf crisis was to have hundreds of 
thousands of professional meditators mediate worldwide to try to 
harmonize world consciousness 
the maharishi leader of the transcendental meditation movement 
told an internationally broadcast news conference in the 
netherlands that the united nations is like a dead body and 
only mass meditation can bring bliss 
he said 7000 skilled meditators in the gulf region could 
improve regional and international atmospheres and make peace 
inevitable 
we cannot rely anymore on the political arena of the world 
the maharishi said from his european headquarters in the dutch city 
of vlodrop 
governments and political organizations are incompetent to 
bring about peace and are of no significance 
what happened to kuwait now can happen to any country or 
little emirate here and there all the military might and efforts 
against terrorism are not succeeding 
his meditation peace plan for the gulf was heard at the united 
nations and in washington austin texas cleveland boston kansas 
city chicago ottawa montreal and toronto 
two days ago the united nations was the site of an international 
tv hookup to commemorate what would have been the 50th birthday of 
the late john lennon one of the beatles who were followers of the 
maharishi 
un officials said they make un conference rooms available to 
worthy organizations without any rental fee and bill them only for 
the cost of services and overtime 
at the yogic hookup thursday only about 30 professional people 
in business suits and a few journalists gathered in a small 
basement conference room at un headquarters and there was no 
transcendental meditation 
after an opening statement the maharishi took questions asked 
about the united nations that recently has had some peacekeeping 
success he said it is a nebulous organization the 
security council cannot guarantee security to any part of the 
world its like a dead body 
he said in answer to a question that un peacekeepers with 
light sidearms should be replaced by professional paid meditators 
that would be more successful and productive he said 
un efforts in the gulf have failed the maharishi said 
that is why we appeal to the people of the world to be united 
now 
his followers claim that 7000 is a magic number for creating a 
powerful meditative consciousness that can affect urroundings and 
behavior they say this has been proved in more than 500 scientific 
studies 
the maharishi said responsible governments should designate 
special groups of 7000 people who then would be taught meditation 
and a form of levitation 
we would train them to fly and that would be the end of all 
unfortunate evils in the world 
the title maharishi signifies a hindu teacher of mysticism

the two key adversaries blocking senate action 
on a bill to reregulate cable television reached a compromise 
thursday that would allow cable companies to continue signing 
programming deals that freeze out satellite dish owners 
sens al gore dtenn and timothy wirth dcolo reached the 
accord after the bills manager sen daniel inouye dhawaii last 
month declared it dead and buried for the year because of 
threats of a filibuster by wirth and a veto by president bush 
bushs veto threat still stands but gore and wirth agreed 
thursday on exclusivity contracts that would require the 
federal communications commission to determine their use illegal if 
abused 
gore who wanted to give satellite dish owners and other cable 
competitors like socalled wireless cable operators better 
access to the programming produced by the cable industry said he 
hoped the bill could be brought to the senate floor early next 
week 
to those who would continue to block its consideration on 
behalf of the cable industry or the white house i would only say 
that such a move would backfire he said threatening to 
introduce a tougher bill on the industry next year 
both the senate bill and a similar measure passed by the house 
last month would require cable operators to provide a basic 
tier of cable service local and public tv stations plus 
governmentaccess channels at rates regulated by the fcc 
including converter boxes on tv sets and remote controls the 
consumer federation of america the major promoter of the 
legislation estimates the basic service should cost a cable 
subscriber no more than 5 a month 
the fcc also could adjust rates for some other cable channels 
such as cable news network mtv and espn but excluding the premium 
services like home box office and cinemax in response to consumer 
complaints 
the legislation is a response to a growing wave of consumer 
complaints about excessive rates and poor service in many areas 
after the industry was deregulated by congress in 1986

a major coalburning power plant near the 
grand canyon contributes significantly to wintertime air pollution 
over the popular tourist attraction but it is not the only 
culprit the national research council said thursday 
the councils report is expected to be used by operators of the 
plant the navajo generating station as an argument for not 
requiring expensive pollution controls 
the environmental protection agency last year proposed that the 
power plant 16 miles from grand canyon national park be required to 
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 90 percent 
to do so the operators of the plant likely would have to 
install expensive scrubber technology critics of the epa 
proposal say that the canyons air pollution problems cannot be 
solved by just reducing emissions from the power plant 
sulfur dioxide can be converted in the atmosphere to sulfate 
compounds in the form of microscopic aprticles which are an 
important contributor to haze in certain atmospheric conditions 
particularly in air stagnation over the canyon and when in clouds 
the issue of air pollution over national parks has been a thorny 
one for lawmakers trying to work out a new clean air act the house 
version of the bill calls for stricter pollution controls to 
protect parks but the senate so far has agreed only to study the 
issue 
the epa proposal for tighter pollution controls at the arizona 
power plant came after the national park service concluded a 2 
million study that purported to tie extensive wintertime haze over 
the canyon to sulfur emissions from the plant 
but interior secretary manual lujan dismissed the national park 
service study as inadequate and asked for a review by the national 
research council an affiliate of the national academy of sciences 
the academy is a congressionally chartered body charged with 
giving the government scientific advice the national park service 
is part of the interior department and a sister agency to 
interiors bureau of reclamation a part owner of the power plant 
the council said it was clear that emissions from the power 
plant reached the grand canyon and that these emissions 
contributed significantly to haze over the canyon marker gases 
deliberately emitted by the plant were found at grand canyon the 
council noted 
the park service study said the power plant accounted for 40 
percent to 60 percent of the loss of visibility in the park but 
the council said it could not determine how much of the canyons 
haze should be attributed to the power plant 
under some weather conditions the haze over the canyon might be 
attributed almost totally to emissions from the power plant while 
under other weather conditions the pollution might contain almost 
no sulfur from the plant but sulfur from other pollution sources 
the panel said 
the park service study did not make certain measurements which 
could have helped resolve the question did not adequately treat 
the conversion of sulfur dioxide into sulfates and did not 
adequately consider the background concentration of sulfates the 
council said 
even with new pollution control equipment at navajo the 
wintertime haze problem at the canyon would likely be reduced 
but not eliminated 
the 14member committee that studied the issue said its 
conclusions were not aimed at resolving the question of whether epa 
should require additional pollution controls at the plant these 
issues involve policy considerations outside the committees 
purview said the panel 
according to the epa the plant burns 24000 tons of coal daily 
releasing an estimated 12 tons to 13 tons of sulfur dioxide per 
hour 288 to 312 tons per day however the council said the plant 
burned about 19000 tons of coal per day during the study period 
and emitted 163 tons of sulfur dioxide per day 
d michael rappaport salt river project assistant general 
manager for governmental affairs said its our conclusion that 
it would be imprudent for the epa to base a regulatory decision on 
findings that have been called into serious question by a group of 
eminent scientists 
dave ryan an epa spokesman said the councils study supports 
our basic belief but said he could not say how it would affect an 
epa proposal expected by early next year

saying by the excelsior news service i hope that octavio paz 
doesnt become a spokesman for the right 
among the more outrageous responses was that of filmmaker rafael 
corkidi who charged the prize was the result of publicity that the 
television chain televisa spends on paz 
televisa which owns the only private television channels in 
mexico frequently is criticized for leaning to the right in its 
news coverage and favoring middleoftheroad talent in its 
programming the giant network sends out photographs of paz among 
its promotional materials 
paz undeniable literary value is wasted with sad speeches he 
gives in favor of the company corkidi said at a poetry festival 
in guadalajara 
paz criticism of leftist intellectuals and aside from paz not 
many intellectuals in mexico are anything but long has estranged 
him from the countrys literary mainstream if such a thing exists 
but mexican writers who have worked with paz such as salvador 
elizondo a collaborator on the magazine vuelta called the prize 
welldeserved 
in the cultural order it gives distinction to one of the most 
important figures of the spanish language elizondo said 
despite the controversy and disagreement that paz ideological 
position generates his creative quality is indisputable said 
jaime labastida a poet who stands opposed to paz on many political 
issues 
in recent months paz has been criticized for traveling overseas 
in the retinue of president carlos salinas de gortari 
salinas attending meetings in venezuela on thursday sent a 
congratulatory message to paz 
he is a poet and writer of whom we mexicans feel proud he has 
a universal stature said the president praising paz for his 
deep mexican and latin american vision 
paz is already one of mexicos bestselling writers many 
students are assigned in school his labyrinth of solitude a 
pithy investigation of the mexican national character 
at the alameda park in downtown mexico city the award generated 
excitement among a group of sidewalk booksellers 
rogelio galindo of the sotano bookshop said he had sold 250 
copies of paz latest work a small chronicle of great days 
the past three months 
for him its good for me its marvelous said manuel 
marquez as he rushed to rescue his books from an afternoon rain 
scooping them off a patch of cardboard on the sidewalk marquez 
stacked them onto a cart 
we hope this will lead us to read more books and by all 
writers said ricardo contreras plata who has sold books for 22 
years on a busy streetcorner opposite mexicos palace of fine arts 
enrique fuente owner of the madero bookstore said the award 
was practically a merchandizing device for selling paz books 
its good because hes a mexican said bookshop customer 
roman picazo 
salvador diaz contera a professor of greek literature who was 
shopping at the madero praised paz as one of the best writers 
in mexico although he said this is not a great era for mexican 
writers 
he said paz image had suffered among intellectuals because he 
seemed to have abandoned his socialist ideals and had become 
friendly with the government 
paz won many fans among the young in 1968 when he resigned as 
ambassador to india in protest over the bloody army attack on 
student protesters 
now he has changed when he sees the retreat of the socialist 
ideology in a great part of the world diaz said 
in fact paz began criticizing marxist governments in the 1970s 
a period that might be construed as revolutionary socialisms

the wrong version of welcome home roxy carmichael must have 
been released because this sloppylooking film never should have 
been allowed into theaters 
the small town of clyde ohio is the setting local kid roxy 
carmichael left there 15 years ago and found fame and fortune when 
she helped inspire the hit song in roxys eyes 
apparantly the good people of clyde have been thinking about 
nothing else since roxy is to return for a grand homecoming and 
the town has arranged a day in her honor with a guided tour of her 
old house and a gala roxy ball no one would dare miss 
two residents are especially anxious to greet the guest of 
honor fifteenyearold dinky bossetti winona ryder is a homely 
eccentric tomboy convinced the departed heroine is her real mother 
denton webb jeff daniels was roxys childhood sweetheart and 
still pines for her although he is now married with two kids 
other highlights include efforts by dinkys stepparents to ship 
her to boarding school a possible relationship between dinky and 
the class hunk a fleeting reference to roxys bisexuality and the 
breakdown of daniels marriage 
none of it really matters the film lasts just 97 minutes and by 
the end you wont really care what happens once roxy arrives 
roxy carmichael was originally scheduled to come out in late 
august and the delay should have been used for a little 
finetuning 
ryder given several scenes communing with animals gets to play 
a suburban elly mae clampett while daniels looks appropriately 
bored the supporting performances are embarrassingly flat as if 
the actors were reading off cue cards and the editing is choppy 
with abrupt cuts and awkward transitions between scenes 
whos to blame perhaps jim abrahams who directed the very 
funny ruthless people but shows no such skill here or perhaps 
one could fault karen leigh hopkins making her debut as a 
screenwriter and executive producer 
for ryder this is the first of three films scheduled for 
release by the end of the year shell also be seen in 
mermaids costarring cher and bob hoskins and edward 
scissorhands with offscreen boyfriend johnny depp 
roxy should be safely out of the way by the time the others 
arrive

the government proposed thursday to 
convert 60 billion of its debt to private foreign creditors into 
medium and longterm government bonds 
the conversion scheme was announced simultaneously by secretary 
of economic policy antonio kandir to us bankers in new york and 
by economy minister zelia cardoso de mello to ambassadors from 
creditor nations in this inland capital 
the negotiations involve 60 billion owed to private lenders in 
the us japan and europe brazils total foreign debt is 114 
billion largest in the third world 
we want to prove that brazil is a solvent country that only 
has occasional liquidity problems cardoso de mello said after 
briefing ambassadors of the united states japan germany france 
great britain italy on the proposal 
she said the repayment plan offered three options 
all debt would be converted into longterm zero coupon 
bonds paying annual interest these bonds could be recovered when 
they mature or beforehand at government auctions held every three 
months 
shortterm exit bonds would be available for purchase at 
greatly reduced interest 
mediumterm bonds would be available at slightly reduced 
interest according to the purchasing capacity of the buyer 
cardoso de mello declined to give details of payment terms or 
interest rates she said because they form part of our 
negotiating strategy 
brazil has accumulated some 6 billion in arrears on interest 
payments of its debt to private banks which it has been under 
pressure to repay 
cardoso de mello said this amount would be included in the 
overall restructuring of brazils total debt 
she also proposed separating debt owed by private brazilian 
firms from money owed by the government which would permit brazil 
to immediately restart debt payments 
debt accumulated by private brazilian firms would not be 
included in the bond conversion plan she said 
the private sector if it has dollars available can pay its 
debt when and how much it wants said cardoso de mello

the task force investigating the deaths 
of five florida students is taking another look at an unsolved 
triple slaying in louisiana because of striking similiarities in 
the crimes 
the stabbing deaths in shreveport la of julie grissom her 
father and her nephew came to the attention of the gainesville task 
force early in its investigation 
investigators at first disregarded similarities because edward 
humphrey was not in shreveport at the time of the november 1989 
slayings sources told the miami herald in a story published 
thursday 
now physical evidence seems to be pointing away from humphrey 
and investigators are again looking into the grissom case the 
herald said 
humphrey a 19yearold university of florida freshman has been 
listed as a suspect in the slayings 
he was convicted wednesday of battery on an person over the age 
of 65 for the aug 30 beating of his grandmother elna hlavaty the 
beating occurred shortly after humphrey returned home to 
indialantic from gainesville two days after the last two bodies 
were found in apartments near the university 
humphrey faces up to 22 months in prison when he is sentenced 
nov 8 he also faces an unrelated attempted sexual battery case in 
indian river county and an assault charge in gainesville 
last week a shreveport detective flew to gainesville to help 
the task force 
shreveport police homicide lt gary pittman confirmed that one 
of his detectives spent several days in florida with the task 
force but he cautioned against concluding that one killer was 
responsible for all eight deaths 
right now were proceeding as if theyre not related he 
said 
authorities believe the intended victim in the shreveport 
killings was 24yearold julie grissom her father william t 
grissom and her nephew 8yearold sean also died in the nov 4 
1989 attack 
among the similarities in that case and the florida murders the 
herald said 
ms grissom was a petite brunette student at louisiana state 
university the four women killed in gainesville were petite 
brunettes between the ages of 17 and 23 and attended the university 
of florida or santa fe community college in gainesville the young 
man killed was living with one of the women 
the killer posed ms grissoms body to shock whoever found 
her the gainesville killer also posed the bodies of victims 
investigators in both states say the killer may have photographed 
the crime scenes 
in both states the killer left behind little evidence 
the shreveport killer used tape during the killings but 
removed it from the victims or took it with him the gainesville 
killer did the same thing 
both killers used liquids vinegar and household cleaner to 
destroy evidence on the victims bodies 
some of the gainesville victims were mutilated but ms grissom 
was not 
serial killing experts however say it is not uncommon for a 
killer to become increasingly brutal

experts on china recommended thursday that the 
us congress not provoke beijing or raise disastrously false 
expectations in offshore taiwan by suggesting a plebiscite on the 
islands future 
maryland university law professor chiu hungdah said mere use of 
the word plebiscite in a proposed resolution would be offensive to 
chinese officials especially on the mainland because of the one 
china policy staunchly upheld by the united states as well as 
both the beijing and taiwan governments 
that policy insists there is only one china and the offshore 
island of taiwan is part of it 
brown university political science professor michael kau said 
terms such as plebiscite or taiwan independence were too 
emotionally charged for a congressional resolution 
but he added i fully agree that the future of taiwan should 
be determined in accordance with the opinion of the people of 
taiwan and i think even the government in beijing should not object 
to that kind of idea 
maysing yang director of the new yorkbased asiapacific 
council on democracy an private advocacy group took issue with 
the two scholars at a hearing of the house subcommittee on asian 
and pacific affairs 
she testified that plebiscite is not an emotional word and 
congress should freely vote its sentiments about democracy 
rep stephen solarz dny the subcommittee chairman was 
seeking opinions on his draft resolution about taking into account 
taiwanese views on the islands future through democratic 
mechanisms such as a plebiscite the draft said beijings 1989 
crackdown against democracy seriously undermines the credibility 
of its pledges on any issue including peaceful union with taiwan 
while pressing for more democracy on taiwan the united states 
should avoid creating a false expectation of support for 
independence or selfdetermination chiu testified this would 
encourage advocates of independence to move taiwan on a course of 
military confrontation with the chinese communists which can only 
bring disaster to all the people of taiwan he added 
a taiwanese dissident recently freed after 11 years in prison 
apologized to the panel saying that it would be inappropriate for 
him as a taiwan citizen to answer questions about the degree of 
democracy on the island 
shih mingdeh noted however that many people have urged him to 
tell the us lawmakers that there are those imprisoned because 
they dissent in word and thought the civil rights and the right to 
work of those who have been imprisoned over these long four decades 
have not been restored those in taiwan who are engaged in 
environmental labor and farmer movements are targeted by the 
government to be treated as mobsters 
shihs americanborn wife linda gail arrigo interpreted for 
him as he added other people requested me to tell the american 
congress that taiwan is not part of the peoples republic of china 
and the people of taiwan have the right to selfdetermination and 
independence

economically pressed argentina wants 
to enter opec according to a news report thursday 
argentine president carlos menem was quoted by venezuelas 
government news agency venpres as saying argentina plans to free 
its domestically controlled energy prices in january and to 
increase foreign oil sales so it can join the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
although our oil exports are still small we are slowly 
increasing them to reach our goals menem was quoted as saying 
menem has been president of argentina which has rich natural 
resources but has been debilitated by years of chronic economic and 
labor problems since july 8 1989 
he said argentine oil now earns nearly 400 million per year 
argentina is a country with oil and it has the option of 
gradually increasing exports menem said 
venezuela and ecuador are the only latin american members of the 
13nation opec cartel mexico and colombia also export oil 
menem spoke while attending a twoday summit of eight latin 
american presidents that began thursday in caracas

a judge friday suspended the 
rebellion trial of sen juan ponce enrile and two others until the 
court of appeals rules on several petitions filed by the 
defendants 
enrile rebecco panlilio and his wife erlinda were to have been 
arraigned friday on rebellion charges in connection with a failed 
coup attempt last december 
but judge jaime salazar noted the three defendants had filed 
petitions with the court of appeals to halt the case 
enrile and the others were indicted in february after witnesses 
claimed they saw coup leader lt col gregorio gringo honasan 
at the opposition senators home on the first day of the failed 
putsch 
enrile denies the charge the panlilios were attending a party 
at enriles home in makati on the day of the coup attempt 
chief prosecutor aurelio trampe charged the defendants were 
using stall tactics salazar also expressed frustration over the 
delays 
the case is hanging in the air he said im for speed 
what is important is the trial on the merits 
enrile was first charged with rebellion and murder but the 
latter charge was dropped he could face up to 20 years in prison 
if convicted of rebellion 
enrile defense minister under late president ferdinand marcos 
led the feb 22 1986 mutiny against marcos that triggered the 
uprising that lifted corazon aquino into the presidency 
mrs aquino fired enrile from the defense ministry in november 
1986 after a failed coup by his followers enrile ran successfully 
for the senate in 1987 and used his post there to lead opposition 
to mrs aquino

eight latin american presidents opened 
a twoday summit thursday with talks on the effect oil price hikes 
from the persian gulf crisis have had on the region and on 
president bushs proposal to create a free trade zone in the 
americas 
the closeddoor sessions were held without ceremony at a 
downtown caracas hotel 
host president carlos andres perez said a communique would be 
issued friday describing the fundamental agreements that exist 
among us and explaining how the political will to integrate our 
economies has strengthened 
nine presidents were to attend the conference but peruvian 
president alberto fujimori was prevented from leaving his country 
at the last minute because he lacked congressional authorization 
first lady susana higuchi de fujimori was to arrive thursday 
evening in his place 
presidents attending were carlos menem of argentina fernando 
collor de mello of brazil patricio aylwin of chile cesar gaviria 
of colombia rodrigo borja of ecuador carlos salinas de gortari of 
mexico luis alberto lacalle of uruguay and venezuelas perez 
the socalled group of rio was founded with eight members and 
chile and ecuador were accepted as members thursday panama was 
suspended from the group during the government of gen manuel 
antonio noriega the inclusion of bolivia and paraguay was expected 
to be announced friday 
perez and argentine foreign minister domingo cavallo said oil 
prices and what they called latin american security on energy 
matters dominated most of thursdays fourhour session 
aylwin on wednesday suggested the region create a latin american 
and caribbean investment fund with windfall profits generated by 
high priced oil and sales of other raw materials he said he would 
raise the idea at the summit 
it would mean studying how nations of the continent can help 
each other reciprocally taking advantage of the fortunes that some 
countries might have at certain times aylwin said 
conference sources said the chilean leaders idea drew 
considerable interest 
borja whose opec nation is one of four latin american oil 
exporters said the oil price hikes posed problems for producing as 
well as consuming nations mexico venezuela and colombia also 
export oil 
although consuming countries face high and even devastating 
expenditures producers risk runaway inflation through the 
injection of massive funds into their economies the ecuadoran 
leader said 
thus everyone should work to stabilize petroleum prices the 
current increase doesnt favor anyone he said 
he called on multinational oil companies and countries with 
large strategic oil reserves such as the united states to put 
stored oil on the market to force prices down 
lacalle whose nation imports all its oil presented the other 
side of the coin uruguays oil bill will jump at least 10 percent 
as a result of the crises he said 
on the bush initiative which proposes free enterprises zones in 
latin america and forgiving some latin debt to the us government 
borja said it was the first time an american president is 
recognizing that the latin american foreign debt is a political 
problem not only an economic one 
how can it not be political if our democratic system depends 
on it he asked rhetorically 
lacalle was more enthusiastic saying that as soon as bush 
presented his june 27 speech i called him up in the white house 
oval office to tell him im 1000 percent behind his initiative 
but lacalle said the general proposal must quickly be made more 
concrete 
the fight against drug traffic and environmental preservation 
are also important themes on the summit agenda

former spies for east germany have handed over 
information about topsecret military projects in west germany 
including the development of the tornado fighter jet officials 
said thursday 
the new disclosures followed the arrest wednesday of eight 
alleged spies for a people accustomed to wild tales of oold war 
espionage in their own backyards the new reports are causing some 
extra headshaking across the recently united germany 
the alleged communist east german spies include a 63yearold 
woman her son and daughterinlaw 
the zdf television network said two more suspected spies were 
arrested on thursday but gave no details 
the espionage activities stretch back to the 1960s and the era 
of highest tensions between east and west 
chancellor helmut kohls government has appealed to former east 
german spies to come in from the cold and it is speculated they 
could face lighter prison terms for doing so 
kohl however warned in an interview that the legacy of the 
east german spy service must not poison our nations 
atmosphere 
we must in no way open up a witchhunt but protect our 
capacity for reconciliation the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper 
quoted kohl as saying 
earlier this week germans learned that the same top secret 
intelligence summaries that reached kohls desk each week wound up 
in communist east germanys spy headquarters 
klaus kuron a top spy quickly started naming names after 
turning himself in to authorities sunday that led to the arrest of 
the eight spies whose crimes were outlined by the chief federal 
prosecutors office thursday 
late thursday the cologne newspaper express said kurons former 
east german control officer had also been arrested there was no 
immediate confirmation from authorities 
one of the group of eight arrested identified only as karlheinz 
s allegedly passed on directly to the soviet kgb information 
about a new tank under development the chief federal prosecutor 
said 
another agent identified only as franz m passed on to the east 
germans information and documents about military helicopters 
the prosecutor said the agent obtained the information while 
working for messerschmidtboelkowbloehm the largest west german 
aerospace manufacturer 
two other people are accused of handing over to the east germans 
information about the development of natos sophisticated tornado 
fighter jet they allegedly took pictures of the original 
topsecret documents and passed them on to the soviet bloc agents 
all eight of those arrested come from west germany according to 
chief federal prosecutor alexander von stahl 
the associated press called von stahls office to learn the last 
names of those arrested but the spokesmen had already left for the 
day and were unreachable at home 
where the latest round of arrests and disclosures will stop no 
one knows von stahl says more developments are expected and he 
has a pool of 8000 former east german spies to pick from in the 
coming months 
leaders of the former east german security service known as the 
stasi are believed to have abetted some of international 
terrorists news reports say the terrorists may still be lurking on 
german soil

walgreen co said thursday it had ordered 
its drug stores nationwide to remove slap bracelets from their 
shelves while the safety of the fad jewelry is investigated 
the action was taken wednesday in response to a complaint 
tuesday that a connecticut child received a minor cut while playing 
with a bracelet said maryellen thielen spokeswoman at walgreen 
corporate headquarters in this chicago suburb 
we just want to make sure that if and when we do put them back 
on the shelves we know they are safe thielen said and while 
we are investigating we have asked them to remove them 
also thursday connecticut consumer protection officials ordered 
the recall of taiwanmade imitations of the popular toys 
the bracelet consists of a 9inch strip of metal encased in 
brightly colored cloth when the strip is slapped against the 
wrist it wraps itself around the wearers arm 
the state department of consumer protection issued the recall 
order after testing three versions of the bracelets for exposed 
sharp edges which are prohibited on most toys under the states 
child protection act 
only one version passed the tests the original slap wrap 
bracelets made by simsburybased main street toy said lois bryant 
director of the departments product safety division 
those that failed were labeled made in taiwan or lacked 
labels she said 
the slap bracelets sold by walgreen are imitations 
main street toy maintains that its bracelets made with 
stainless steel are not dangerous but that imitations are made 
from cheaper steel that will rust and snap

two japanese sailors held nearly seven years in 
north korea returned home thursday after being released by the 
communist north in an apparent bid for closer relations with japan 
isamu beniko 60 and yoshio kuriura 59 looked healthy and 
relieved as they stepped off a chartered all nippon airways 
airplane into bright sunshine at haneda airport 
in a scene televised live and nationwide beniko broke with 
customary japanese reserve and waved vigorously toward the airport 
terminal after a private reunion with their wives inside the 
plane the two seamen were driven to a local hospital for medical 
checkups 
he hasnt changed much i was relieved benikos wife 
maneko said in a news conference 
returning on the same plane from pyongyang north koreas 
capital were top officials of japans two largest political 
parties which had negotiated the mens release in a period of 
unprecedented contact between japanese politicians and the north 
korean government 
japan has no diplomatic relations with pyongyang it recognizes 
the norths archrival south korea 
prime minister toshiki kaifu told reporters at his official 
residence that he was happy about the seamens return kyodo news 
service reported 
pyongyangs official korean central news agency monitored in 
tokyo said they were given amnesties from a humanitarian 
stand 
on wednesday in pyongyang north korean president kim il sung 
and ichiro ozawa secretary general of japans governing liberal 
democratic party agreed that the two asian neighbors should begin 
talks to establish diplomatic relations quickly the nationally 
circulated newspaper asahi shimbun reported 
ozawa and takako doi chairman of the opposition japan socialist 
party had been invited to celebrations wednesday of the 45th 
anniversary of north koreas ruling communist party called the

freighter fujisan maru no 18 on which a north korean soldier min 
hong gu had stowed away to japan 
japan rejected the norths demand that min be sent home in 
1988 it granted him permission to live in japan 
meanwhile in december 1987 north korea retaliated by 
sentencing the two seaman to 15 years in prison for alleged spying 
their release became a key hurdle to improved japannorth korea 
relations 
late month a delegation from japans governing party met in 
pyongyang with north korean officials and the two sides agreed to 
open talks in november on establishing diplomatic relations between 
the two countries 
japan ruled the korean peninsula as a colony from 1910 until its 
defeat in world war ii in 1945 after the war the peninsula was

egyptians voted thursday in a referendum to 
decide whether to give president hosni mubarak a mandate to 
dissolve parliament 
security officials meanwhile remained on alert to terrorists 
threats spawned by the persian gulf crisis 
interior minister abdelhalim moussa whose ministry handles 
internal security said arabs angered over mubaraks antiiraq 
position are threatening egypt with sabotage and assassination 
five moslem fundamentalists were reported arrested in a southern 
city for distributing antigovernment leaflets otherwise voting 
was reported occurring without incident 
the voters had to answer yes or no to the question do 
you approve of the dissolution of the peoples assembly 
government officials expected a comfortable probably 
overwhelming affirmative vote under the constitution that would 
allow mubarak to disband the assembly declared illegal by the 
countrys highest constitutional court and call new elections 
within two months 
more than 23000 polling stations nationwide opened in the 
morning thursday for nine hours 
the turnout in cairo and major cities appeared low 
mubarak and his wife suzanne voted at the northeastern cairo 
suburb of heliopolis their official residence 
in southern egypts assiut police armored cars and trucks were 
seen at key points including squares and within the assiut 
university compound city and university have been for years 
centers of hardline moslem antigovernment agitation 
assiut police sources said five fundamentalist students were 
arrested on campus as they distributed leaflets the sources said 
the leaflets opposed holding the referendum now and attacked the 
presence of american and other western forces in the gulf region 
officials said security was tightened nationwide in preparation 
for the referendum in the past week authorities have reported the 
arrest of 35 palestinians and iraqis suspected of planning 
sabotage 
mubarak has led arab opposition to iraqs aug 2 conquest of 
kuwait 
in addition to iraq some palestinian factions have threatened 
egypt openly with sabotage and acts of terror interior minister 
moussa told a cairo seminar they said they will export 
terrorists to egypt to assassinate public figures 
mubarak suspended the 458member peoples assembly on sept 26 
because of a may 19 ruling by the supreme constitutional court that 
the assembly was elected under an illegal law he also scheduled 
the referendum on dissolution as required by the constitution 
the sevenjudge court said provisions of the law violated the 
constitutional principle that all egyptians must be given equal 
opportunity to be elected to public office it let individuals run 
against each other alongside balloting for candidates on political 
party lists 
using his executive lawmaking powers in parliaments absence 
mubarak promulgated an election law that appears to satisfy the 
courts objections he canceled the partylist method and 
proportional representation and revived the system of voting among 
individual candidates that prevailed in egypt under the monarchy 
ended by a coup in 1952 
the president also redrew electoral districts creating 222 
constituencies instead of 48 the next parliament will have 444 
elected members two from each district and 10 appointed by 
mubarak 
egypt has an electorate of about 15 million from a population of 
55 million everybody over 18 can vote but political apathy causes 
some men and many women particularly in rural areas to neglect to 
register

the house is being asked to approve the

boost taxes on gasoline tobacco alcohol and higherincome

i really think this plan could pass rep jim moody dwis 
said after the house ways and means committee approved the 
deficitreduction plan by voice vote on wednesday 
a similar plan is in the making in the senate finance committee

boston ap coffee drinkers delight a good cup of joe or 
two or three wont hurt the heart harvard researchers reported 
today 
in fact coffee with caffeine the often maligned chemical that 
gives the brew its kick may turn out to be easier on the heart 
than the decaffeinated variety 
its amazing how coffee has a bad name when the harder one 
looks at health hazards the more difficult it is to find adverse 
effects says dr walter willett of the harvard school of public 
health 
his research part of a huge study of healthy people shows that 
those who drink several cups of ordinary caffeinated coffee every 
day do not raise their risk of heart attacks

marta de teixeira campos knew the 
price of a frozen chicken but that was yesterday it had risen 50 
percent overnight 
the rice black beans cooking oil and cheese in her cart were 
vital if her four children were to be fed so mrs campos 
reluctantly handed the chicken back to the supermarket cashier 
she and most of the 150 million other brazilians are feeling the 
bite of a resurgent inflation that makes survival a daily struggle 
wages dont go up to match prices and the public is gradually 
losing confidence in the economic shock plan decreed by 
president fernando collor de mello on mar 15 
inflation plunged from 84 percent in march to 33 percent in 
april and the poor elated by their new buying power gave collor a 
74 percent approval rating in may 
unfortunately inflation didnt go away prices rose 96 percent 
in june by august the monthly rate was up to 105 and in september 
nearly reached 13 percent 
helio jaguaribe a leading sociologist said inflation had now 
reached the level where it is biting into basic needs 
brazilians shrugged off inflation for years because 
costofliving indexing protected wages and savings the government 
had to print money to pay the bill however and that made 
inflation worse 
in june collor did away with wage indexing and said workers 
must negotiate their own pay increases 
in september he abolished rent control to encourage 
construction and rents tripled overnight a onebedroom apartment 
in the affluent south zone that rented for 500 a month last year 
now costs 1700 
people returning from winter vacations found the 800cruzeiro 
ride from home to the airport cost 1900 in the other direction 
a movie ticket has tripled in two months to 300 cruzeiros about 
340 a month of lambada dance lessons doubled to 5000 cruzeiros 
or 56 and the cost of an international telephone call has tripled 
since june to about 5 a minute 
prices of auto parts inhabit an unreal world of their own a 
volkswagen distributor charges 95 for a headlight enough to buy 
more than 26 pounds of prime beef 
newspapers are filled with announcements of price increases 
magazines offer advice on how to cope and invest money and carry 
classified ads from people who want to pool stocks of food and 
household items 
prices vary wildly a mens linen shirt costs the equivalent of 
560 at a one shop in downtown rio and a similar one goes for 80 
at another 
all prices may be going up but they rise more rapidly in some 
stores than in others in september a government price supervision 
agency said a check of 325 shops turned up 300 different prices for 
the same brand of suntan lotion 
comparison shopping has become a national pastime 
marcia sobreira evangelista a 29yearold lawyer said 
inflation forced her to atted the theater less often 
so what does she do instead i go to mall to see the prices 
when collors austerity plan froze most bank accounts barter 
became popular joao alves do brito starting out as a dentist 
traded his 1981 volkswagen beetle for dental equipment 
i was lucky said brito 32 i avoided a big hassle of 
getting cash and who knows when the manufacturer would have 
delivered the materials 
as inflation grows so does the amount of time and energy spent 
in coping with it 
sandra ippolito brunoro 34yearold manager of a sao paulo 
officelighting company says she spends three hours a day reading 
journals and newspaper business sections in an effort to keep her 
money from losing value 
you start thinking whatll be today gold dollars or 
putting it into the stock market she said its incredibly 
unproductive but what choice do you have 
computer analyst sebastiao freitas gomes 27 tries to beat the 
system by shuffling money between bank and investment accounts 
every friday afternoon gomes transfers money from his checking 
account into a shortterm overnight money market that pays 10 
percent a month 
its tricky he said because you have to get to the bank 
first thing on monday to tranfer money back into your checking 
account to cover the checks you wrote over the weekend 
brazilians have turned to credit cards as a way to delay 
payment there is no finance charge when the total balance is paid 
promptly and using a card locks in prices that prevailed at the 
time of purchase 
some merchants will not accept credit cards others follow the 
illegal but common practice of charging credit customers 45 
percent more than those who pay cash

colombia is trying to repair a judicial 
system made powerless by drug traffickers who often kill judges 
and court officials they cannot bribe or coerce 
president cesar gaviria inaugurated aug 7 plans fortress 
cities where judges can live and work free of intimidation that 
presents them with a choice of plata o plomo money or lead 
the countrys powerful crime organizations are leaving the 
judicial system in complete impotence said fernando carrillo 
judicial adviser to gaviria 
an elite corps of untouchable specialized judges 
policemen and lawyers is to be created and given constant 
military protection 
federal prosecutors not judges will investigate organized 
crime and the identities of judges hearing cases will be concealed 
judges now spend hundreds of hours gathering evidence 
in nine years 228 judges and other court officers have been 
murdered in colombia according to the judges union 
judges who stand up to the medellin cartel run the greatest 
risk in july 1989 judge maria helena diaz and her two bodyguards 
were killed in bogota she had issued an arrest warrant for pablo 
escobar head of the cocaine cartel 
twelve judicial workers were murdered in january 1989 while 
investigating massacres of peasants in northern colombia 
in both cases the government blamed paramilitary death squads 
paid by the drug barons 
marta restrepo a regional attorney general and her bodyguard 
were shot to death in july in apartado a northern bananagrowing 
region she was investigating the massacre of 42 peasants in which 
suspicion also fell on the death squads 
when the medellin cartel declared war on the government in 
august 1989 thenpresident virgilio barco figured he had no choice 
but to resume extraditions to the united states 
the cartel had the government against the wall said 
attorney general alfonso gomez magistrates were receiving 
coffins in their homes as death threats there was no way they 
could have tried these cases freely in colombia 
drug gangs have been blamed in the past year for the killings of 
550 colombians but recently declared a unilateral ceasefire 
president gaviria revised the extradition policy with a decree 
sept 5 that drug traffickers who surrender can be tried in 
colombia instead of being sent to the united states he also 
announced the judicial reforms 
in making the extradition offer and proposing reforms gaviria 
sought to show the colombian people the government was 
strengthening its own institution rather than relying on foreign 
governments a policymaking official told the associated press 
we cannot construct an antiterrorism policy based on the 
justice system of the united states he said on condition of 
anonymity 
extraditions are unpopular and many colombians consider them an 
insult to the country colombia is unable to keep traffickers in 
jail however and extraditions are likely to continue until the 
courts can function properly 
as long as no other clear alternative exists well still have 
extraditions said jorge orlando melo president of the institute 
of political studies in bogota 
barco asked the united states last year to help provide physical 
protection for judges the bush administration sent bulletproof 
vests and armored cars as part of a 65 million aid package for the 
drug war 
a high judicial official said also on condition of anonymity 
a few vests and cars with this you protect an entire institution 
from the most powerful mafia in the world 
he said the united states should offer to train judicial 
workers and added that colombia needs money to build 
maximumsecurity prisons 
on sept 18 a man accused of murdering a leading presidential 
candidate escaped from la picota the most heavily guarded prison 
in bogota 
jaime rueda believed to be in charge of explosives for the 
medellin cartel was one of three suspects in the murder of liberal 
party candidate luis carlos galan whose death led to the yearold 
drug war 
four years ago honduran trafficker juan ramon matta walked out 
of la picota passing through 17 doors that were supposed to be 
locked 
inefficiency plagues colombias judicial system 
for example the supreme court president must personally appoint 
drivers to take court officers to and from their homes this is 
madness said carrillo the presidential adviser 
under the gaviria plan the executive branch will coordinate the 
judicial system 
federal prosecutors working with the police and attorney 
general will collect evidence and press charges judges who now 
gather evidence and act as prosecutors will be limited to deciding 
guilt or innocence 
of colombias 5000 judges only 200 to 500 living in the 
fortress cities will hear cases related to drugs or terrorism 
officials say 
computers and evidencecollecting techniques are to be 
modernized and the government is may establish a special corps of 
the 100 top judicial police 
carrillo said the reforms will cost the equivalent of 190 
million about 3 percent of the national budget and take 18 
months some changes will require constitutional amendments and 
others will need congressional approval 
colombian governments have talked of reforming the judiciary 
since the 1970s but only now does there exist the political will 
to do so carrillo said

he telephoned the first men on the moon he 
opened the door to china and in 1974 he became the only 
president to resign from office under the certainty of impeachment 
and the likelihood of conviction 
its 1990 now and richard m nixon is tanned rested ready and 
rehabilitated and nixon a threehour documentary is opening 
the season monday for the american experience series on pbs 
its a comprehensive biography of the 37th us president 
evenhanded wellresearched full of good photographs and familiar 
footage unfortunately nixon and his immediate family did not 
cooperate in the making of the film 
nixon makes fine viewing for someone born since 1969 for 
whom nixon is ancient history but it wont satisfy those who lived 
during his prime 
nixon has been a national figure since 1948 when the young 
california congressman made headlines by birddogging alger hiss 
alleged communist ties before the house unamerican activities 
committee 
nixon fails to show how his character led to the high 
crimes and misdemeanors that toppled him for concealing his 
governments ties to the june 1972 botched breakin at democratic 
offices in the watergate complex 
interviews with nixon historians and biographers cannot 
illuminate the labyrinth of nixons character as historian james 
macgregor burns has noted elsewhere nixon was not merely 
complex he was opaque 
nixon tells of a boy born to a lower middleclass family 
with an unsuccessful father and a distant dominating mother two 
brothers died at an early age richard was smart serious a gifted 
actor and debater 
whittier college duke university law school and world war ii 
service in the navy followed in 1946 nixon ousted rep jerry 
voorhis dcalif by claiming he was communistsupported 
anonymous phone calls said worse 
in 1950 he beat helen gahagan douglas for the us senate with 
an equally sleazy redbaiting campaign there is a 1979 interview 
with douglas who died the next year her revenge was the nickname 
that haunts him still tricky dick 
his next political leap nearly undid him fresh on the 1952 gop 
ticket as dwight d eisenhowers vice president he attacked 
democratic corruption and immediately was accused of having a 
secret slush fund he denied everything 
he bypassed the press in the socalled checkers speech 
televised to the nation he spoke of his children his wife pat 
and her republican cloth coat and the family dog checkers it 
saved his place on the ticket 
nixon uses footage from the checkers speech and nixons 
first televised debate with john f kennedy in the 1960 
presidential race and it shows the embittered nixon in 1962 after 
losing a bid for governor of california 
you wont have nixon to kick around any more he told 
reporters because gentlemen this is my last press 
conference six years later the new nixon won the presidency 
and inherited the divisive vietnam war 
his attempts to end the war diplomatic initiatives steppedup 
bombing and vietnamization of the ground war divided the 
nation even further 
the watergate era is the best and final hour of nixon we 
get to see the brooding still photos of nixon bunkered in the white 
house and the speech that claims the support of a great silent 
majority 
the film shows how the white house perceiving political 
opposition to the war as subversion compiled an enemies list 
used by the fbi cia and irs to attack its foes and created an 
extralegal plumbers unit to stop leaks 
and then there was the watergate breakin but for washington 
post reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein uncredited by name 
in nixon the president and his men might have gotten away 
with it 
as it was the reporters found a massive campaign of political 
spying and sabotage that led straight to the white house and 
triggered our nations greatest constitutional crisis 
there are excellent interviews with cheerful expansive former 
aides including john ehrlichman john dean and charles colson 
who did time for watergate crimes and speechwriter ray price 
nixon ultimately fails because of its ending there is the 
damaged man ascending the helicopter steps the sudden agonized 
wave the embarrassing awkward vsigns its still painful to 
witness his departure into exile 
but he didnt stay there and the film neglects to mention his 
miraculous rehabilitation as elder statesman for the republican 
party that omission only emphasizes the obvious history is not

consumers who opt for bottled water over tap 
water might be surprised to learn that their preferred drink could 
be drawn from the source they want to avoid their public water 
supply 
some water lovers may already know this particularly those who 
live in a state like california that requires bottled water labels 
to disclose the source 
but in areas that depend largely on federal regulations to 
ensure the quality of their bottled water consumers may find 
little more than a brand name and a picture of a pristine mountain 
lake on the label 
theyre selling a lot of bottled water because it is believed 
to be better and purer and safer but thats not necessarily so 
all it has to be is as good as tap water said edward zadjura 
who is overseeing a general accounting office study on bottled 
water regulations 
you can have the mountain in the background but you just 
cant say it comes from a mountain or a lake if it doesnt he 
said you can let the publics mind and imagination wander where 
it wants 
he also notes that people overlook the fact that springs can 
be as polluted as anything else 
the gao study was requested by rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee after traces of benzene was found in perrier bottled 
water 
the bottled water industry which favors source labeling is 
careful not to make claims of the relative safety of bottled vs 
tap water the reason people buy bottled water is because of the 
taste said william deal executive vice president of the 
international bottled water association 
but is it safer 
the answer is sometimes it is and sometimes it isnt said 
herbert allen an environmental engineer at the university of 
delaware who helped conduct a 1981 study of domestic and imported 
mineral waters 
the study the results of which were published last year found 
that 24 of the 37 brands tested exceeded us drinking water 
standards for at least one chemical 
but a recent food and drug administration sampling of 50 
imported and 50 domestic brands of bottled water found very 
little reason for concern said fda spokesman chris lecos 
the environmental protection agency sets drinking water 
standards in the united states and these must be followed by 
municipal water suppliers bottled water however is the 
responsibility of the fda which generally adopts the epa 
standards 
if there is a taste difference the reason is chlorine its 
added to public water supplies to eliminate bacteria bottled water 
doesnt contain chlorine either it wasnt added in the first 
place or it was taken out 
often when the source of a bottled water is the public water 
supply the chlorine and other possible organic and inorganic 
substances have been removed 
municipal water suppliers feel theyve been taking unwarranted 
hits from the bottled water industry 
if the consumer thinks they like the taste of bottled water 
thats fine said jack hoffbuhr deputy executive director of the 
american water works association we just dont want them to be 
scared into buying it 
we want the public to know the tap water is safe and they 
dont need to pay 1 a gallon or more for this product unless they 
want to he said

the new economics now on display in congress is 
confusing millions of americans who were brought up on a more or 
less standard brand of the art that everyone understood 
it included government actions to smooth wrinkles in the 
economic cycle maintaining an equilibrium between supply and 
demand and avoiding inflation and recession economic growth was 
good stagnation was to be avoided 
now they arent sure the new economics they fear belongs to 
no school at all and say the wags isnt likely ever to gain 
admittance to a school it appears instead to be a conglomeration 
of conflicts and contradictions 
those brought up in the practical school of economics over the 
past half century accepted the idea that government intervention 
was sometimes acceptable to control an economy from growing too 
weakly or too strongly 
booms and busts were to be avoided you avoided booms by raising 
interest rates and maybe taxes and by controlling federal 
spending you averted recessions by lowering taxes and interest 
rates and maybe by spending more 
the new economics now on display in washington seems to be a 
different and so far unidentifiable brand since it would raise 
taxes and avowedly slow federal spending while the country heads 
toward recession 
it is also accompanied by a monetary policy a federal reserve 
policy that appears to be more concerned with inflation than 
recession and that has resisted pleas by businesses and investors 
for easier money 
yes its confusing and it may be little solace to people to 
realize that many members of the professional economic fraternity 
are as confused as anyone negatives abound they say and more 
taxes might make them worse 
among the negatives 
economic expansion if it still exists has slowed to a crawl 
and may soon go into reverse consumer confidence is at its lowest 
since the 1982 recession unemployment is growing steadily 
manufacturing activity is stalling 
small businesses are complaining of a credit crunch 
bankruptcies are rising banks are failing important insurers are 
endangered because their real estate portfolios have collapsed 
household business and government debt is high 
the securities markets are in serious trouble junk bonds are 
defaulting and the stock market has plunged erasing not just 
billions of dollars but literally trillions from portfolios around 
the world in august and september 
had such a situation occurred in the past it most likely would 
have been countered by calls for propping up the economy through 
tax relief lower interest rates and conceivably some pumppriming 
by the federal government 
today the economy seem to be caught in a vicious political 
debate that obscures the issues it has no sponsor no spokesman 
no outspoken defender those who might have accepted the role are 
too busy with the budget 
the federal reserve which handles monetary policy has 
indicated that interestrate relief might be forthcoming if budget 
negotiators reach an acceptable agreement but what if they dont 
meanwhile government activity as a percentage of gross national 
product is likely to grow by default of the private sector taxes 
as a percent of gross national product could rise to 195 percent 
close to a postworld war ii high 
the last two times that government revenues accounted for so 
much of gnp the economy fell into recession and that is the 
expectation expressed today in a growing number of published 
forecasts

gov l douglas wilder has changed many 
things in more than two decades in politics 
he was the first black elected to the virginia senate since 
reconstruction 
he became the nations first elected black governor 
now the rising political star wants to change the national 
democratic party he is chipping away at bedrock democratic 
doctrine in a quest to redefine it in more fiscally conservative 
terms 
wilder fired a broadside at his own party that sounded almost 
reaganesque in its denunciation of tax increases 
a backroom tax deal stacked against the middle class wilder 
said of a quickly defeated federal deficitreduction package he 
criticized democratic national chairman ron brown for endorsing it 
in speeches and a recent interview the governor describes 
himself as the personification of a new mainstream style of 
politics that blends fiscal conservativism with social activism 
it helped get him elected governor made him a hot commodity for 
speaking engagements around the country and some say could help 
put him on the national democratic ticket in 1992 
and now he seems to be playing the role of outsider in a 
notsosubtle campaign to gain an inside track on 1992 
the next successful democratic presidential candidate will be 
someone who can identify with the totality of the american 
public and have shown soee degree of fiscal responsibility says 
wilder 
he says he plans to serve his full term of governor which ends 
in 1994 but others arent so sure 
wilder knows hes got one shot at national office and just 
about everything he does in the state is geared to that says 
larry sabato a university of virginia political scientist 
wilder risks alienating many of his strongest supporters by 
trying to wipe out a 14 billion state deficit solely through 
spending cuts 
civil rights and labor groups have been somewhat disenchanted 
with his performance so far he concedes 
the only special interest that i recognize is the people of 
virginia he says in defending his approach the political heat 
is likely to get worse when he discloses details of the planned 
cuts 
wilder concedes his record in richmond will be like a 
fingerprint if he seeks national office but he minimizes 
speculation that hes positioning himself for a place on the 
national party ticket 
the governor said i didnt include myself when talking about 
the type of democrat he believes can return the party to the white 
house 
still in his first six months in office he visited 11 states 
including the early presidential sweepstakes states of new 
hampshire and iowa he has injected himself on the national scene 
asking president bush to appoint an independent commission to 
investigate the savings and loan bailout and has expressed support 
for israel 
he also has gotten some unwanted publicity using a state 
helicopter to take personal trips with patricia kluge estranged 
wife of americas richest man john w kluge 
at times wilder acts like a political outsider raising 
eyebrows in the party establishment he made waves with his blast 
at brown on the deficitreduction package 
it is becoming more apparent than ever before that our 
twoparty system is becoming a competition between the party inside 
washington and that new party the vast majority of americans who 
live outside who see the need to unite to protect their 
interests wilder wrote he assailed both parties for fiscal 
irresponsibility drawing criticism in return 
wilder would have been better off to be speaking in support 
of any washington budget package that was intended to curb the huge 
deficit responded former democratic party chairman robert strauss 
i think people all over are looking for answers and 
solutions said former chairman paul kirk and they can ally 
with anyone who says something is wrong but the toughest part is 
to say what the solution is 
wilder winces when asked whether he could be compared to house 
republican whip newt gingrich who has established a record as a 
gop maverick like wilder gingrich loudly denounced higher taxes 
as a solution for federal deficits 
im not familiar with newt gingrichs politics wilder said 
one of the things i think differs is that ive shown i can work 
with people from both sides with all segments there isnt the 
schism that follows me that follows him 
former democratic party chairman charles manatt says the next 
presidential candidate must be a fiscal moderate because americans 
be they black white or brown arent going to step up in 
favor of higher taxes 
according to political scientist sabato wilder understands 
that a conservative white democrat would not be nominated by a 
party where the selection process is dominated by liberals 
but he also knows that a black conservative could not be 
opposed by liberals it wouldnt be in their constitution to be 
against that sabato concludes 
wilder has a point in suggesting that the democratic party must 
nominate a fiscal moderate or conservative next time around 
strauss says 
but it isnt just doug wilder saying it strauss said stu 
eizenstat a liberal has been saying it ive been saying it 
georgia sen sam nunn has been saying it i think were all 
singing from the same hymn book 
kirk said i dont disagree at all with what hes suggesting 
as the type of candidate the party needs its just easier said 
than done 
wilders new mainstream style follows two decades in which 
he adhered to liberal principles while climbing the ladder of 
virginia politics 
his father was a clerk at a black insurance company his mother 
cared for the eight children the family was poor enough that they 
had to stuff their shoes with newspaper 
wilder was elected to the virginia senate nearly 21 years ago 
the first black since reconstruction he promptly asked for 
replacement of the official state song noting that its lyrics 
extol plantation life under old massa 
he became one of the most influential senators in the 
legislature shepherding an array of antidiscrimination laws and 
winning a long battle to declare a holiday honoring martin luther 
king he won the lieutenant governorship in 1985 after rejecting 
the pleas of white party leaders to pull out they feared he would 
sink the ticket headed by gerald baliles he won the governorship 
in 1989 by emphasizing his prochoice stand on abortion 
wilder prizes political experience 
it would be awfully difficult for someone like jesse jackson 
to get on the ticket without some prior life in high public 
office wilder says he did not support jacksons bid for the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1984 or 1988 
a pragmatist wilder says unsuccessful democratic presidential 
candidates starting with hubert humphrey couldnt win in todays 
atmosphere of soaring budget deficits he says 
george mcgoverns positions on foreign policy and defense 
likely would be considered too soft 
walter f mondale is eminently qualified to be president 
but was perceived as too beholden to democratic party constituent 
groups 
michael dukakis didnt react aggressively to bushs negative 
advertising and probably lost the 1988 presidential election 
because of it 
wilder has said he foresees a black president in the not too 
distant future many people think he has himself in mind

one candidate awaits a verdict on 
excommunication another fights to stay in a religious group she 
helped found four find themselves out of work rejected by voters 
all of them are roman catholic and all of them are paying a 
price for their positions on abortion no matter which side 
theyre on 
hold to the church teaching that abortion is murder and a 
candidate risks learning the hard way that many voters think 
otherwise support a womans right to an abortion and the 
politician may become a pariah in his or her own parish 
several recent incidents illustrate the clash between religion 
and politics 
jim moran the mayor of alexandria va and a prochoice 
democratic candidate for congress skipped communion three times 
i didnt want to challenge my pastor and members of the church 
who would feel upset if a confrontation developed he explained 
the local bishop is weighing a request to excommunicate moran 
catholic abortion rights supporters defeated antiabortion 
catholics in four maryland state senate primaries veteran state 
sen frank shore an ardent abortion foe said the voters 
disappointed him i thought if they knew my opponent was a 
catholic for death and i was a catholic for life they would 
respond he said nobody responded 
state rep mary boergers who defeated shore in the democratic 
primary has stopped speaking at catholic high schools and keeps a 
low profile to protect her pastor shes being thrown out of a 
catholic scientists group she helped found you can say you are 
where the voters are but you pay a personal price boergers 
says 
the price for catholics both personal and political has risen 
since the supreme courts 1989 decision giving states more latitude 
to restrict abortion the ruling turned abortion rights into a 
winning issue in some races and at the same time put increased 
pressure on catholic public officials 
last october rep bob dornan rcalif had the names of all 
catholic members of congress with prochoice voting records 
published in the congressional record 
they never have to pay any price dornan declared on the 
house floor there are 352 active bishops and they never lean on 
the selfproclaimed catholics in this house who say i personally 
believe it is a human being with an immortal soul a child in the 
womb but go ahead and kill it and ill help you pay for it 
just days later bishops meeting in baltimore declared abortion 
the fundamental human rights issue the bishops said no 
responsible catholic could be prochoice and urged all public 
officials especially catholics to seek laws limiting 
abortions 
and last june cardinal john oconnor in new york warned that 
catholics who promote prochoice legislation or make public funds 
available for abortion are at risk of excommunication it is the 
only option if such actions persist he said 
richard doerflinger associate director of the national 
conference of catholic bishops antiabortion office disagrees 
there has been any escalation of pressure on catholics in public 
life since the baltimore meeting 
i dont know of any catholic politician whos been criticized 
for failure to toe the line with an absolute position on this he 
said 
however catholics for a free choice cites dozens of incidents 
over the past year among the groups examples 
montana bishops confronted four state officials over their 
prochoice stands 
a diocesan newspaper in providence ri banned the 
publication of christmas greetings from politicians who had not 
signed a statement saying abortion should be constitutionally 
banned 
two candidates for the pennsylvania legislature were dismissed 
from church positions because they favored abortion rights 
prochoice legislators were forbidden to talk to parochial 
school students in south kingston ri and yonkers ny 
in one of the best known cases a california bishop denied 
communion to state senate candidate lucy killea because she 
supported abortion rights killea went on to win a special election 
and tip the chamber to a prochoice majority her opponent blamed 
the church saying killea had been elevated to martyr and celebrity 
status 
the killea case was by no means an isolated case of backlash 
against the church and the davidvsgoliath phenomenon has not 
been lost on church elders 
the bishops are becoming more aware of that said 
doerflinger its an additional reason to be very very cautious 
about anything that seems to be a church penalty against a public 
figure 
doerflinger said some campaign consultants actually advise 
prochoice candidates to try to provoke a negative reaction from 
the church shore the maryland loser takes a similarly cynical 
view of his prochoice brethren 
at candidate forums the first thing they holler is im 
choice im choice i think theyre trying to read the tea 
leaves shore said i was willing to take that chance in 
defense of the unborn i would do exactly the same thing 
today if i had it to do over again 
some observers believe the church may be creating a problem that 
transcends individual victories or losses 
there is a fear that the bishops could actually create an 
anticatholic climate in the electorate said frances kissling 
president of catholics for a free choice she said voters could 
come to view catholic politicians as puppets of the church and 
distrust their ability to put broader interests first 
that raises an issue many catholics thought had been laid to 
rest 30 years ago when john f kennedy won the presidency 
one candidate even paraphrased kennedy to demonstrate his 
independence 
i am not the catholic candidate for congress rhode island 
democrat john reed said earlier this month i am a candidate for 
congress who happens to be catholic

it may be the greatest art museum you never 
heard of 
there is no sign outside the barnes foundation just a small 
framed notice on a gate to a main line mansion that is hidden 
behind towering trees and dense rhododendron 
those who sign in at the gatehouse and pay 1 inside the door 
step into a world of renoir cezanne and matisse that makes art 
lovers weak in the knees 
its a staggering collection says new york art collector 
and dealer richard l feigan its one of the legendary 
repositories of masterpieces of postimpressionists in the world 
they have more cezannes than the met the national gallery and 
chicago combined and theyre all very high quality says gary 
tinterow associate curator of european painting at the 
metropolitan museum of art in new york 
the collection is unrivaled adds charles e stuckey modern 
art curator at the art institute of chicago 
that collection including 171 renoirs 57 cezannes 54 
matisses 19 picassos and several paintings by van gogh seurat 
degas and rousseau is probably worth more than 1 billion 
theres an embarrassment of choice there are so many great 
things said marco grassi a curator in new york it should be 
one of the musts on everyones tour of great things to see in 
america 
but the foundation is open just 2 days a week all day friday 
and saturday and sunday afternoon and is closed most of the 
summer paintings are not sold or lent out and color reproductions 
slides or prints are forbidden 
the collection and the restrictions are the legacy of scientist 
and inventor dr albert c barnes who established the foundation 
in 1922 according to a plan he laid out shortly before his death 
at 79 in 1951 control of the foundation has shifted to lincoln 
university a largely black college in the chester county town of 
lincoln university 
the change has art scholars hoping for a more open policy at the 
foundation 
its phenomenal and wonderful and we all like it said tom 
freudenheim assistant secretary for museums at the smithsonian 
institution but its idiosyncratic 
thats why so many outside the art world havent heard of the 
barnes foundation which is not as barnes stressed a museum but 
an educational institution offering classes in art appreciation 
barnes was an eccentric brilliant scientist who invented an 
antiseptic argyrol a mild silver protein that fights infection 
made a fortune and bought art great art in bunches in the early 
20th century sometimes an entire studiofull at once 
among the treasures les grandes poseuses by seurat le 
bonheur de vivre by matisse and the card players and girl by 
cezanne 
barnes feuded with the art establishment barring critics art 
historians and museum officials and most of the general public from 
his galleries after his death members of the public were allowed 
to enter if they made a reservation 
slowly things are changing the reservationsonly restriction 
was lifted a few years ago as was a limit of 450 visitors a day 
and foundation officials have been talking with museums about 
modern gallery practices something barnes avoided 
prior to this the barnes foundation was considered nearly an 
eccentricity and made no attempt to become part of the art world 
said feigan who is on the lincoln university board of trustees 
barnes put the paintings on the walls of the mansion in crowded 
symmetrical arrangements one wall holds 24 canvases picassos and 
matisses surrounding a modigliani a single small room contains 
more than 30 renoirs 
museums tend to be carbon copies said freudenheim of the 
smithsonian its nice to have a place with real personality i 
think the idea of a collectors personality shining through is a 
nice thing its full of masterpieces its extraordinary 
the arrangements as well as the pieces of decorative iron 
hardware stuck on the walls and the antique furniture in the rooms 
are essential elements in barnes art education program 
that program teaches the scientific analysis of painting what 
barnes felt was an objective way to judge composition color and 
in the end quality 
art appreciation can no more be absorbed by aimless wandering 
in galleries than can surgery be learned by casual visits to a 
hospital a foundation pamphlet says 
a host of publications are available at the foundation 
explaining the barnes way of looking at things and reflecting his 
quirks one pamphlet by violette de mazia education director until 
her death in september at the age of 89 was titled the lure and 
trap of color slides in art education and subtitled the 
timereleased venom of their makebelieve 
he acted more crazy than he was feigan said if you look 
at it the man was brilliant the kind of masterpieces he bought 
could only be bought by someone with an acute eye and brilliant 
judgment 
that judgment wasnt infallible experts say numerous paintings 
that barnes bought as old masters are merely copies 
barnes was long interested in african art he amassed an 
impressive collection and friendly with lincoln universitys 
president he amended a trust indenture nine months before his 
death to allow the school to select foundation trustees as the 
original trustees retired or died by 1988 lincolnnamed trustees 
were in the majority 
dont expect things to change 
first and foremost we intend to be very faithful to the 
indenture and we intend to ensure that the foundation is able to 
carry out its mission as envisioned by dr barnes said richard 
glanton president of the foundation 
id like to emphasize that no quick changes will be 
implemented if any at all simply because the character and 
personality of the institution is a very delicate thing 
however stuckey of chicagos art institute thinks hours should 
be lengthened and catalogs published with color reproductions if 
someone called me up today and offered a decent salary to do a 
catalog id be packing my bags today he said 
said the mets tinterow who was consulted by the trustees 
they are very well equipped to usher the barnes into the next 
century and maintain it as it is which is jewel of a collection 
which represents the ideals and tastes of a remarkable man

metromedia co founder john w kluge the 
wealthiest man in america credits much of his success to plain old 
gambling and good luck 
the greatest factor in my life and i know entrepreneurial 
people dont want to express it they think it diminishes them 
but luck plays a large part kluge told forbes magazine in a 
rare recent interview 
the 76yearold kluge pronounced kloogy is worth an estimated 
56 billion making him the richest man in the country according 
to forbes the forbes 400 ranking released last monday marked the 
second straight year kluge topped the list last year the magazine 
estimated his worth at 52 billion 
while many successful men are driven by money kluge is not 
said his estranged wife patricia 
john was a pioneer he wasnt particularly a man who wanted 
to be rich or enjoy a grand life mrs kluge 41 told the 
washingtonian magazine in an interview published in august 
he was more an intellectual businessman than a moneymaking 
businessman she said he was more challenged by the creation 
of new ideas and new markets against all odds he took a small 
idea and turned it into something grand 
friends and colleagues also describe the stocky balding kluge 
as friendly and downtoearth 
hes just a regular guy said alson h smith who has known 
the kluges since they moved to virginia in 1982 hell talk about 
anything you want to talk about 
kluge born in germany came to the united states in 1922 at age 
8 the son of an engineer he and his family settled in detroit 
and for a time he worked on a ford assembly line 
during the depression kluge enrolled in columbia university and 
earned an economics degree in 1937 he worked in army intelligence 
during world war ii 
at columbia kluge told forbes he was a gambler often playing 
cards well into the night to help earn money for school i came 
out of college with 7000 he said 
kluge got into broadcasting after the war buying his first 
radio station in 1946 later he expanded into television and his 
holdings metromedia broadcasting eventually grew into seven tv 
stations and 14 radio stations the tv stations eventually became 
the foundation of fox television 
business wasnt always smooth in the early 1980s metromedia 
was taking a beating on wall street 
kluge convinced his properties were worth much more decided to 
go private by buying out public shares he warned his wife of tight 
financial times ahead but by her own account she wasnt 
sympathetic 
there was no buildup for this thing i was stunned as any 
wife would be she said and i said why dont you have a 
fortune all those people lesser than you certainly dont have your 
brain and your vision but they have fortunes 
when he told her it had never been important for him to become 
rich she shot back damn it it is now the kluges had just 
adopted a son john w kluge ii 
go out and become a billionaire and dont come back until you 
are she said she told her husband and he did 
kluge had met patricia rose the baghdadborn daughter of a 
british father and scottishiraqi mother at a dinner party in 
1976 she was divorced from russell gay publisher of the british 
mens magazine knave which had run nude photographs of her 
she and kluge were married in 1981 he for the third time 
what attracted me was his brilliance she said i was 
absolutely knocked out by his ability to achieve whatever he wanted 
to achieve 
the reclusive kluge declined to be interviewed by the associated 
press 
after the highly leveraged buyout that gave him all of 
metromedia kluge sold off the pieces for 465 billion according 
to forbes and personally netted more than 16 billion 
i felt that television was going to change kluge told 
forbes of the selloff i just thought that it was going to get 
more competitive 
since then kluge has invested his profits in other interests 
including cellular telephones and restaurants he owns the 
ponderosa steak house bonanza and steak amp ale chains he recently 
sold his new york cellular operations for more than 1 billion in 
cash and 850 million in stock 
kluge plays his business deals as close to the vest as he plays 
his cards 
whenever i have a plan i keep it really very much to myself 
because i make changes in my own mind he said its been a 
habit of mine to do that not because i dont want to look like i 
dont make mistakes i make mistakes all the time but rather so 
that people around me dont feel that every five minutes im 
changing my mind 
i have to work things out and i sometimes change in the 
middle of the course he said 
i think the ability to gauge risks is crucial i never 
ordinarily take on things that i cant see some end to where you 
pile risks on risks he said 
one of kluges lesserknown business ventures is cattle breeding 
on his 10000acre albemarle farms estate in the shadow of 
monticello thomas jeffersons home near charlottesville va 
before the kluges separated this spring he balanced the week 
between virginia and his new york office but now spends more time 
in new york in a 1986 broadcast interview he said he moved to the 
pastoral county near the blue ridge mountains because its a 
place where the urban centers like washington dont encroach he 
also owns 70000 acres in scotland 
mrs kluge will keep the 45room albemarle house mansion the 
couple built on the virginia estate plus a reported 15 million 
weekly allowance she serves on the governing board of nearby 
university of virginia 
she and kluge contributed 200000 to virginia gov l douglas 
wilders campaign for election last november and both served as 
chairmen of wilders inauguration festivities in january 
since the separation which by all accounts was amicable mrs 
kluge has been romantically linked to the 59yearold democrat 
wilder says only that he is friends with the kluges

there is reason to believe the new paul simon 
album wont be received as well as the double grammywinning 
graceland still rhythm of the saints where south africa 
meets brazil meets the usa was the next logical step 
i think its inevitable that people will compare this to 
graceland you can make the comparison but its relevant 
in terms of what i took from graceland and continued with in 
this the singersongwriter said of his new release 
in terms of do you like it more or less thats up to peoples 
taste or opinion is it better is it worse time will tell its 
really not my job to be deciding that which is a break for me 
because im very critical 
rhythm of the saints which will be in record stores on 
monday is not the accessible uptempo romp of its predecessor a 
cultural melange that unites brazilian drummers with african 
musicians with american session players rhythm is a darker 
denser work than graceland 
simon said he enjoyed the project as much as the graceland 
sessions although he doesnt expect the response the previous 
album generated 
phenomenons dont occur every time i dont expect that this 
is going to be a phenomenon simon said during an interview in 
his brill building office you dont set out to create a 
phenomenon you set out to create a piece of music 
simons immediate postgraceland music had a different focus he 
recorded a duet with brazilian singer milton nascimiento and 
started work on an as yet unfinished broadway musical its not 
pop music its a different kind of music different periods of 
time he said of that project 
there were other things to keep simon busy backtoback 
grammys for graceland and his induction with old friend art 
garfunkel into the rock and roll hall of fame 
rhythm of the saints began when simon set off for brazil in 
march 1988 following the advice of quincy jones and nascimiento 
that he should check out the great drummers from around the world 
simon was immediately swept up in the sounds and began recording 
drum tracks including one done on an eighttrack recorder in the 
town square of a brazilian village several trips south ensued 
with simon finally getting to work full time on the record in may 
1989 
i thought i would be finished by fall 89 but you know 
typically i missed my deadline said simon who was remixing and 
resequencing the album up until two weeks ago 
the album features the drum tracks mixed with some south african 
players ladysmith black mambazo makes an appearance and some 
topnotch help from the united states horn player michael brecker 
drummer steve gadd guitarist jj cale and accordionist cj 
chenier 
cajun veteran chenier fit right in with the eclectic mix of 
players simon said 
i go back to the premise that the west african and brazilian 
cultures are connected and likewise into caribbean and into 
louisiana in the united states said simon so you bring cj 
chenier and you let him play he finds a pocket 
its a little louisiana groove but it fits because there are 
those elements i was dealing with a big arc of culture that 
spanned thee different continents so a lot of the stuff worked 
brecker and gadd will tour with simons 14piece band later this 
year a group that will include four brazilian percussionists 
i was dealing with really extraordinary musicians its 
a privilege to get them said simon 
while graceland followed simons commercially disappointing 
hearts and bones this album follows a certified smash simon 
said hes not concerned about following up a multiplatinum effort 
its not the first big hit that ive had its not even the 
first phenomenon thats occurred to me i mean the graduate was 
a big thing bridge over troubled water sold twice as much as 
graceland said simon 
still crazy after all these years was the album of the 
year the concert in central park about a half a million people 
so ive had big successes before and ive had flops

the voters president bush was telling a group of 
them are frustrated outraged by whats going on in washington 
sick and tired of smoke and mirrors that hide congressional 
spending habits 
it sounded like an often tested seldom successful republican 
formula campaign against congress where the democratic majorities 
are this would seem to be a promising season for that message 
with signs of rising wrath about the governments inability to 
manage its own budget 
but the bush message is tempered this time with good reason 
hed like more republicans elected to congress on nov 6 but he 
also needs democratic support there before election day to get 
the government out of its tax spending and budget maze 
believe me when you dont control either house of the united 
states congress it aint easy the president told a republican 
fundraising reception in atlanta wednesday night 
and it gets worse for a white house that cant hold the 
republican minority together for a tax and spending settlement to 
cut the deficit bush held a white house reception thursday night 
for select republican house members meaning the 71 who stuck 
with him on a budget settlement they were a minority of the house 
minority 105 republicans bolted and helped kill the budget bush 
favored no reception for them 
it is an outrage whats happening up there bush said 
sucking up tax dollars on one end and turning them into spending 
programs without end and frankly if we had more republicans in 
congress we wouldnt be in this mess 
but ive got to work with the democrats in congress because i 
was sent there to govern not to give speeches about it 
he said were outnumbered weve got to get the democrats to 
come with us 
in bushs limited political warfare he tells his offyear 
campaign crowds that congress is responsible for solving the 
problem and ought to get on with it to bring this ghastly 
federal budget deficit to its knees 
i didnt come down here to assign blame he said in st 
petersburg fla but you know the american people are 
pretty smart they know where the action is and they know that 
congress has the responsibility to pass a budget and its about 
time that they met that responsibility 
thats tame stuff matched against the traditions of 
presidential campaigns against congress the classic was harry s 
trumans daily denunciation of the donothing 80th congress in 
1948 when republicans were in control 
every republican president since his time has had occasion to 
campaign against democratic congresses interrupted only by gop 
majorities in the senate during ronald reagans first six years 
dwight d eisenhower said congressional democrats were gloom 
merchants men of little faith bent on obstruction of programs 
the people wanted reagan said if he couldnt make liberal 
democrats in congress see the light he would make them feel the 
heat from the voters heres a flash from the gipper theyre 
not going to win he said 
bush came to office pledging bipartisanship saying he and 
congress werent elected to bicker thats still part of his 
message even at campaign rallies and despite the confrontation 
that is built into divided government 
bush has vetoed 14 bills this year and hasnt been overridden 
once hes threatened a budget veto if he doesnt get satisfactory 
terms by friday a move that could lead to a government shutdown 
i have tried to negotiate in good faith with the liberals in the 
congress he said at one southern campaign stop and i believe 
the american people didnt send me as president to play cheap 
politics they sent me up there to govern

in 1984 the cameras rolled as gov bob 
graham hefted the first shovelful of dirt in a historic project to 
fill a canal and rebuild the river it replaced 
the 340 million kissimmee river restoration project is crucial 
to the survival of the everglades if it succeeds it will serve as 
the model for similar projects around the country authorities say 
this is the headwaters of the everglades system and the 
everglades is probably the most endangered national park closest 
to the brink of environmental collapse said brien culhane of the 
wilderness society who is chairman of the everglades coalition a 
network of 25 environmental groups 
this is going to be the most ambitious riverine restoration 
project ever attempted 
grahams shovelful of dirt remains the only dirt moved so far 
but congress is nearing final action on legislation to authorize 
the project and appropriate 2 million to 6 million for the first 
year of the decadelong project 
after two decades of debate final design work on the project 
could begin next year 
weve overcome the major hurdles said estus whitfield 
environmental adviser to graham and the present governor bob 
martinez 
the aim is to undo a us army corps of engineers floodcontrol 
project a segmented canal that brought howls from 
environmentalists even before it was completed in 1971 
about half the 56 miles of canals will be filled to force water 
back into the old river run and on to the surrounding flood plain 
the project has forced state and federal officials to drop 
rhetoric about saving the everglades and to confront tough 
questions how much is ecological restoration worth is restoring 
the kissimmee river worth 340 million 
so far the answer has been yes but the money hasnt yet been 
spent and the bills havent come due 
i think its going to be a good test case as to whether 
society is going to pay for these things said kent loftin 
director of the kissimmee river restoration project for the south 
florida water management district and for whether technology is 
going to be successful at modifying some of our past work more in 
line with the way wed like to have things today 
the kissimmee river lies at the headwaters of the everglades 
system covering the southern third of florida the entire system is 
a shallow sieve filtering fresh water that bubbles southward from 
the river through lake okeechobee and the everglades wetlands to 
the sea 
lake okeechobee the largest freshwater lake in the united 
states after the great lakes covers 730 square miles but is only 
12 feet deep south of the lake water moves through the everglades 
in a river 50 miles wide and six inches deep its chronicler the 
writer marjorie stoneman douglas called it a river of grass 
before the corps o engineers bulldozed a channel through the 
kissimmee it was a delicate braided network of oxbows and 
meandering tributaries that stretched about 100 miles from lake 
kissimmee to lake okeechobee 
the canals were intended to ease flooding along the river and 
they succeeded but that was not all they accomplished 
the kissimmees braided course is bordered by a flood plain that 
was periodically inundated with water before the canal was 
completed thats what made the system so productive said john 
wullschleger a fisheries biologist with the florida game and 
freshwater fish commission in okeechobee it was almost like a 
factory that produced birds and fish 
with the canal completed the fish spawning grounds disappeared 
most of the year the water sits in the canal wullschleger 
said 
people are encroaching into flood plain once theyre there 
theres nothing you can do a lot of the flood plain has been 
turned into pasture rather than wetlands 
the 30footdeep canals are stagnant much of the year the water 
is poor in oxygen and cant support plants florida fish adapted 
to shallow water and aquatic plants have declined dramatically 
without the gentle flow and filtering action of the wetlands 
agricultural pollutants that enter the river are eventually 
deposited in lake okeechobee the primary water source for 
floridas southeastern coast 
in 1983 graham now a us senator inaugurated a 
savetheeverglades program that included a provision to somehow 
restore the environmental values of the kissimmee river 
in 1985 the corps of engineers completed a report outlining 
options for restoring the river but under reagan administration 
policy the economic benefits of the project had to outweigh the 
costs 
there were no quantifiable economic benefits lewis hornung 
director of central and southern florida projects for the corps 
said so we concluded that there was no federal interest in 
proceeding with the restoration project 
meanwhile the south florida water management district had begun 
its own research including the construction of several weirs or 
dams as part of a demonstration project to determine whether river 
channels would recover if water were forced back into them 
what we saw was good response from the old river channel to 
having flow restored loftin said we saw good response from 
the flood plain from having it flooded seasonally 
by 1989 the water management district had decided to recommend 
the most expensive restoration option it provides for the complete 
filling of 25 to 30 miles of the 56mile canal and partial filling 
of much of the remainder 
the canals cant be entirely filled because people have moved 
into the flood plain along the upstream portion of the canal 
loftin said 
in january martinez endorsed that recommendation the corps of 
engineers has so far received 63 million for work on the 
kissimmee river 
the first part of the project will cost 80 million 30 million 
in construction costs and 50 million to buy land in the flood 
plain 
florida will be responsible for most of the land costs it hopes 
congress will pay for most of the construction 
loftin said 9 million or 10 million is likely to be spent 
during the next two or three years depending upon the size of 
congressional appropriations the next step is approval of the 
overall plan by the corps of engineers expected early next year 
if we got a project commitment at about that point in time we 
have all the necessary steps identified to begin the final round of 
detail work that needs to be done loftin said the major work 
we feel could begin sometime in the middle of 1992 land 
acquisition has already begun 
the corps of engineers has been touting that theyre the new 
environmental engineers of the 1990s the kissimmee project should 
be their flagship culhane of the everglades coalition said 
this will be looked at internationally as a model of ecosystem 
restoration that we can look at our past mistakes that we have 
the will and wherewithal to begin restoring natural systems where 
we can

epic takeover battles and soaring operating costs 
might sound like a formula for failure but they havent downed 
united airlines 
but the carrier is beating the flaps off its competition and 
many observers sum up uniteds success in two words pacific 
expansion 
earlier this year it became the biggest carrier across the 
pacific ocean surpassing japan air lines and northwest airlines 
uniteds success comes despite two leadership changes and four 
buyout bids in the last four years as well as an industrywide 
domestic business slump and a sharp increase in fuel prices 
parent company ual corp rejected the latest employee 
acquisition offer tuesday ending more than a year of constant 
pressure on the companys board and management 
but the stress never showed in the airlines performance 
we all suspect its been distracting but anybody who makes 
that assertion is hardpressed to support it said robert decker 
an airline analyst with duff amp phelps inc 
ual had not yet resumed contract negotiations wednesday with its 
flight attendants pilots and mechanics said company spokeswoman 
sara dornacker 
the unions which all are working under expired contracts 
pledged on tuesday to pursue all means necessary to get 
substantial improvements in wages and benefits 
but uniteds revenues market share and ontime performance have 
actually improved since last year while passenger complaints and 
mishandledbaggage reports are down 
profits have slipped parent ual corp reported net income of 
112 million for the first six months of 1990 compared with 207 
million for the same period last year 
and ual earned 324 million for all of 1989 after posting record 
profits of 11 billion in 1988 but analysts say the decline 
reflects the condition of the entire us airline industry 
for the first nine months of this year uniteds transpacific 
revenue passenger miles the number of miles flown by paying 
customers totaled 153 billion a 32 percent increase over the 
same period last year 
the surge in pacific business compares with a 34 percent 
increase in uniteds north american business for the first nine 
months of 1990 
pacific travel now accounts for 24 percent of uniteds business 
that share is likely to grow as the airline adds to the 755 flights 
it now makes each week across the ocean said united spokesman joe 
hopkins 
chicagobased united has been taking delivery of one new plane 
per week in recent months mostly to replace aging aircraft in its 
domestic fleet but the airline also has received six longrange 
boeing 747400s in the past year to expand its transpacific fleet 
and will soon announce a large order for widebodied jetliners for 
international travel hopkins said 
the pacific expansion directed by ual chairman stephen wolf 
has given united a slight edge over archrival american airlines in 
monthly revenue passenger miles since june as of september united 
still trailed american in yeartodate business but appeared likely 
to become the undisputed largest us airline by yearend 
transpacific business also has been a boon to uniteds bottom 
line because longdistance routes are the most profitable an 
airline can fly 
a long flight allows an airline to spread fixed costs such as 
food and labor over a greater number of miles reducing the cost 
per mile 
and the laws of supply and demand allow airlines to increase 
profit margins for flights across the pacific 
in the united states youve got six or seven carriers flying 
into london six times a day but if you want to go to tokyo youve 
got maybe four carriers each having one flight a day said 
analyst stephen dexter of kemper financial services inc 
a lot of people want to go to tokyo and theyll pay a premium 
price to get there

gulf nations hit hard economically by 
saddam husseins invasion of kuwait are putting on brave faces 
despite big cash crunches paralyzed stock markets drooping trade 
and bolting expatriates 
gulf banks squeezed of their liquidity by the mass scramble for 
dollars in august have been releasing statements saying the 
situation has normalized 
abdullah saif governor of the bahrain monetary agency recently 
told the arabiclanguage daily alayam that the public has 
already started to return some of those funds to the banking 
system stability is quickly returning to bahrains banking 
sector 
but neutral observers say the oilrich region is in a state of 
limbo 
the sooner the state of nowar nopeace is over the better 
said a western businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
normality has returned to some extent but unless its a 
matter of quick profit no ones going to risk anything for the 
moment 
deposits in bahrains commercial banks declined by 12 percent 
during the panic that gripped the region in the first weeks after 
iraqs aug 2 invasion some 19 billion riyals about 5 billion 
were pulled out of qatar by the end of august 
in the united arab emirates central bank governor abdulmalik 
alhamar estimated that in the first two weeks of august deposits 
including those by the government dropped by 59 percent 
privatesector deposits declined by 98 percent he said 
bahrain qatar the uae oman saudi arabia and kuwait are 
grouped in the gcc economic and security alliance together with 
iraq and iran the gulf states sit on twothirds of the worlds 
proven oil reserves 
gcc assistant secretarygeneral for economic affairs abdullah 
alquwaiz told the saudi press agency in riyadh this week that 
ministers of finance and economy and central bank governors in 
the gulf cooperation council are confident about the solidity of 
the economic fiscal and banking conditions of the member states 
fawzi behzad director of bahrains stock exchange also 
dismissed his markets tumbling as a normal reaction to the 
situation 
bahrains stock market was strong enough to absorb what 
happened in the gulf he said just like any market prices go 
up when there is good news and they go down when the news is 
bad 
but observers say some uncertainty remains 
exchange houses throughout the region have been among the 
busiest centers as expatriate workers diligently remit their 
salaries back home in greater volume than before 
the profile of gulf foreign trade has changed considerably a 
businessman in the uae who asked to not be named said local 
banks were asking for 100 percent cash coverage for letters of 
credit which is not possible for most mediumsized companies 
nervous shippers are also asking for cash down payments before 
sailing five major lines serving the gulf announced rate hikes due 
to additional fuel charges and currency adjustment rates 
property values have decreased across the gulf and the 
departure of an estimated 10 percent of expatriates has affected 
trading said abdulnebi alshoala a member of bahrains chamber 
of commerce the purchasing of luxury items and durables has 
decreased he said 
recruitment agencies also say there will be fewer westerners 
working in the region 
now it is really difficult to get new recruits from europe to 
convince them to work in the gulf and those who accept would like 
to impose their own conditions including astronomical salaries

knightridder inc unveils a redesigned 
newspaper thursday that seeks a share of quality time in this 
babyboomer rich suburb 
the news a reconstituted 35yearold daily takes its visual 
cues from usa today with heavy use of color maps and indexes 
eyecatching graphics and clean lines 
in content short trendy stories will be the norm broadsheet 
sections have been reserved for the top news local developments 
business and sports feature articles are offered in a tabloid 
magazine called essentials 
what we did was to take a very specific community and say if 
we were reinventing the newspaper if a newspaper didnt exist in 
this place and we were trying to create a newspaper that we 
thought would have the greatest appeal to the people in this 
community what would it be said james batten knightridder 
chairman and chief executive officer 
while many newspapers have evolved along similar lines in recent 
years this is one of the most thoroughly researched projects aimed 
at baby boomers the population bulge between ages 25 and 43 also 
has among it many infrequent newspaper readers 
people were skeptical at first because they were afraid we 
were trying to reinvent usa today for the local area said lou 
heldman the projects corporate coordinator 
it is meant to have all of the traditional journalistic 
components to do investigative reporting to be a watchdog over 
government and institutions to run stories with an edge when 
thats called for and to not homogenize the writing style 
nearly two years of research went into a prototype intended as a 
model for the company which produces 29 dailies including the 
miami herald the philadelphia inquirer and the detroit free press 
there are 77 million people in the baby boom generation they 
will be the primary customers for news for about the next 40 
years heldman said no one can afford to forget them if they 
want to be in business 20 years from now 
but for decades many newspapers stayed the same staid gray 
shade while everything from television to working women were 
remaking american society 
we dont spend much time in the business asking ourselves what 
our readers are interested in news editor wayne ezell conceded 
we tend to engage people who read newspapers we need to talk to 
the people who dont read newspapers 
miamibased knightridder has done that and thinks it has 
produced a product busy boomers will want 
this one has the cosmetic element to it but the cosmetics are 
not what is important here ezell said we are trying to write 
more about things that people are talking about 
the newspaper whose circulation is estimated at 40000 has 
been tailored specifically for boca raton a community of 67000 
people between fort lauderdale and west palm beach its image is 
that of an upscale retirement haven but 30 percent of the 
population is in the baby boomer pool half of whom have arrived in 
the past five years 
loyal older readers havent been left out a focus group study 
of readers over age 45 showed that its a bigger hit frankly with 
the older readers than the younger readers he said 
batten regards the news as a laboratory testing potential 
applications for other knightridder papers 
the changes are welcomed by industry analysts watching a company 
whose strength has been its prizewinning editorial content 
i think in todays busy world people will appreciate this and 
find the papers more readable said investment analyst susan 
putnam of moran asset management in greenwich conn itll be 
interesting to see how it develops

loss of about 500 million and would post a yearly loss for the 
first time in its history

friday to 13625 by the end of trading wednesday 
analysts say travelers woes have deepened investors fears 
about insurance companies many like banks and other financial 
institutions have extensive investments in real estate and 
mortgages 
a standard amp poors corp index tracking stock prices of 
multiservice insurance companies has dropped 28 percent since the 
beginning of the year aetna life amp casualty co stock closed 
wednesday at 29875 off 50 cents from tuesday and down from a 
1990 high of 57 per share 
analysts caution however that travelers problems dont 
necessarily foreshadow serious troubles for other insurance giants 
they say travelers has been an aggressive investor in real estate 
and is saddled with a relatively high level of bad loans 
in general insurance companies do have exposure to real 
estate problems and some of those problems have yet to be 
recognized said gloria vogel an analyst for bear stearns amp co 
the question becomes how far ahead of the pack is travelers 
in recognizing problems or is travelers just in a worse 
situation 
by the companys own acknowledgement they made some errors 
said herbert goodfriend an analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc they were very aggressive in the early 1980s with an 
overindulgence in the southwest 
of its 573 billion in total assets 173 billion is invested 
in real estate mostly in mortgage loans on commercial properties 
such as hotels office buildings and shopping centers 
travelers estimated friday that 35 billion of its mortgage 
loans are problems either foreclosed in the process of 
foreclosure or restructured to be repaid over a longer period 
that news was not completely unexpected the company was forced 
to set aside 415 million in reserves in 1988 
but the company also announced it was reducing dividends to 
stockholders for the first time from 60 cents to 40 cents for the 
third quarter it was that announcement goodfriend said that 
scared off investors and raised questions about travelers future 
it destroyed investor confidence he said and it raises 
the question of whether the company will stick to the new dividend 
schedule 
without the 650 million real estate charge travelers chairman 
edward h budd pointed out the companys operating income for 1990 
was expected to exceed 1989 earnings of 319 million by as much as 
25 percent 
in an attempt to calm investors travelers executives met with 
analysts and investors monday in new york spelling out a plan to 
boost the companys capital by selling some assets 
by cutting the dividend the executives explained they hoped to 
save about 100 million and use it to expand the companys 
moneymaking lines of propertycasualty insurance and managed 
healthcare group insurance 
but both of those lines face uncertain futures 
propertycasualty insurance tends to be a cyclical market and most 
analysts agree the cycle is slumping and many analysts including 
goodfriend believe the growth of managed healthcare group 
insurance peaked in the 1980s and that travelers may be arriving in 
that market too late

in a country where tea is not just a beverage but 
a social event two companies are betting consumers will drop the 
messy ritual of brewing leaves or bags and go for granules 
but are britons ready to have their favorite drink or 
cuppa any other way 
nestle failed to woo tea drinkers with an instant version more 
than a decade ago and many britons are still horrified by office 
instant tea made by machines 
a spot check on a london street found britons unenthusiastic 
about the idea of tea granules which brooke bond and premier 
beverage products said wednesday they will begin distributing 
nationwide 
that would be dreadful said garnham trotter a 48yearold 
electrical engineer we have instant tea in machines in the 
office and its really dreadful 
susan essex a 26yearold secretary said i think part of 
the pleasure of tea is the brewing of it 
in the united states instant iced tea is popular but the hot 
version never caught on 
tea is the favorite drink in britain 80 percent of the 
population over age 10 drinks tea every day and the average person 
drinks three to four cups a day the tea council says 
successful test runs in the midlands in central england over the 
past few months have convinced the two companies that their instant 
tea is the biggest development in the 12 billion tea market since 
tea bags hit britain 37 years ago tea bags make fourfifths of all 
cups brewed loose tea the rest 
the tea councils executive director illtyd lewis said theres 
bound to be a market for instant tea 
still he said i dont see it turning the tea world on its 
head people will continue to brew the product in the traditional 
ways as they have done for hundreds of years 
the two companies are spending 18 million marketing the 
granules and premier beverage products even plans to distribute 
free samples to half of britains homes 
its a natural progression said premier spokesman tony 
camp this is what coffee has done 
camp conceded that making a traditional cup of tea is not so 
difficult or timeconsuming wet leftover bags aside but if 
you can put convenience and taste together it seems to be a 
winner he said 
nestle sold nestea as an instant hot tea in britain in the 1960s 
and 1970s but it was not a success said nestle spokesman allan 
allbeury 
it was probably before its time allbeury said people 
would brew their tea very much to their particular tastes nestea 
was a very standardized flavor

share prices in tokyo plunged today as wall 
streets steep decline discouraged investors the dollar closed 
unchanged against the japanese yen 
the nikkei 225share index lost 90948 points or 387 percent 
closing at 2258563 that added to a 135point drop on tuesday 
markets were closed wednesday for a national holiday 
investors were discouraged by the 111point decline in the dow 
jones industrial average over the past two sessions with 
investors almost shocked by the new york markets declines there 
were very few buy orders said masashi wakabayashi a trader with 
yamaichi securities co 
traders also linked the decline to rising oil prices and the 
weakening tokyo bond market 
in currency dealings the dollar traded as low as 12945 yen 
before closing at 12995 yen matching its closing level on 
tuesday 
the dollar opened lower after an overnight drop in new york but 
heavy profittaking on the yen checked the dollars slide traders 
said fears of possible interest rate cuts in japan also supported 
the dollar 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno told a news conference 
today that the dollar is falling too quickly against the yen 
despite basic factors in the market that support its decline 
the market is still striving to adjust to prospects of lower 
interest rates and weakening business conditions in the united 
states he said mieno added that the us federal reserve is 
likely to ease monetary policy soon leading to lower interest 
rates 
expectations of lower us interest rates are encouraging 
foreign exchange traders to sell the dollar as the value of 
dollardenominated securities declines 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
government bonds fell to 8274 points from tuesdays 8348point

the bush administration predicts that bank 
failures will reduce the government insurance fund protecting 
deposits by 61 billion over three years a house subcommittee 
chairman says 
the commercial bank fund of the federal deposit insurance corp 
will decline from 114 billion at the end of june to 53 billion 
by sept 30 1993 which would mark its sixth consecutive annual 
loss rep frank annunzio dill said wednesday 
the shrinkage to less than half the funds current size will 
come even if regulators continue to raise insurance premiums 
charged to banks said annunzio chairman of the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions 
he cited projections by the administrations office of 
management and budget contained in the budget agreement reached by 
white house negotiators and congressional leaders on sept 30 
the new estimates are far more pessimistic than the budget 
offices previous projections in june it had estimated the fdic 
would show a profit of 600 million over the threeyear period 
roger watson fdic director of research said the figures as 
described by annunzio certainly are pessimistic 
they are possible but not likely he said 
they show the fund reserves falling to only 22 cents for every 
100 in deposits by the end of the 1993 fiscal year that is less 
than onefifth the 125 minimum considered safe and less than half 
the 60cent level in the fund at the end of june 
these omb projections are doubly alarming when you realize 
that they are based on economic assumptions that do not include a 
recession annunzio said the taxpayer is in serious jeopardy 
of being asked to bail out the banks 
annual losses in the fund by fiscal year are projected at 37 
billion in 1991 23 billion in 1992 and 100 million in 1993 
the latest forecast is being made despite an assumption that 
insurance premiums paid by banks will continue to rise the fee 
already is set to increase from 12 cents per 100 of deposits this 
year to 195 cents next year the budget office assumed it would go 
to 23 cents in 1992 and 1993 
the fdic itself has not made projections for its fund beyond the 
end of this calendar year the bank fund lost 18 billion in the 
first six months of this year and will lose an additional 1 
billion by dec 31 the agency has said 
fdic chairman l william seidman said last summer the fund was 
under stress but would be adequate to handle foreseeable bank 
failures which are expected to total around 200 in 1990 for the 
fourth consecutive year 
nevertheless seidman is asking congress to lift legal caps on 
how high his agency may raise its insurance premiums legislation 
to do that has passed the house and is scheduled for action by the 
senate banking committee on friday 
the general accounting office congresss auditing arm and the 
congressional budget office have issued warnings about the 
condition of the bank insurance fund

advocates of toughened import restrictions 
intended to protect the jobs of american textile clothing and shoe 
workers will have to wait for another day 
for the third time in five years supporters of tighter quotas 
failed wednesday night to muster a required twothirds majority in 
the house to override president bushs veto of a quota bill 
the 275152 roll call fell only 10 votes short of the needed 
margin of approval however and opponents predicted the issue will 
be back when a new congress convenes in january three strikes 
and youre out may be the rule in baseball but not necessarily on 
capitol hill said rep philip crane rill 
in vetoing the measure last friday bush said the measure would 
pick the pockets of us consumers at an average cost of 100 a 
year in higher clothing prices for a typical family of four and 
undermine efforts to get other countries to lower their barriers to 
american exports 
over the past decade the united states has lost some 400000 
textile and apparel jobs 66000 in the last year alone to a 
tripling of imports from lowwage trading partners 
for all the rhetoric and theory about free trade the real 
issue is american jobs of people we were elected to represent 
who pay taxes to keep this government going rep helen bentley 
rmd said in urging an override 
the senate passed the bill in july by a potentially vetoproof 
margin of 6832 the house approved it last month 271149 despite 
bushs repeated vows to that he would veto it 
wednesdays vote maintained bushs perfect veto record since 
taking office 20 months ago he has disapproved 15 bills and all 
10 override attempts in congress have failed 
the bill would have imposed new quotas on a productbyproduct 
and countrybycountry basis to limit the annual growth of us 
imports in textiles and textile products to 1 percent a year 
imports of nonrubber footwear leather vinyl and plastic 
shoes would have been frozen at 1989 levels none of the 
provisions would have applied to canada and israel which have 
freetrade agreements with the united states 
congress passed nearly identical bills in 1985 and 1988 but 
then as now was unable to muster the twothirds majorities needed 
in both the house and senate to override vetoes by former president 
reagan 
this year supporters were able to pick off opposition from some 
farmstate lawmakers who feared trading partners would retaliate by 
limiting their imports of us agriculture products 
sen thomas daschle dsd sponsored a provision to permit 
textile clothing and shoe imports above the quotas from any 
country that increases its purchases of us farm exports 
however many us apparel manufacturers who had supported the 
bill in the past abandoned it this time after relocating their 
factories to mexico and the caribbean to employ lowwage workers to 
cut and sew clothing from americanmade fabric

pausing at present after its declines over the past few days and is 
likely to continue downward soon given the ongoing economic

opening a stock exchange 70 years after lenin 
outlawed trading is the easy part getting soviets to invest 
savings long hidden under mattresses will be the bigger hurdle 
aspiring soviet investors and their new york stock exchange 
mentors agreed during a seminar this week that a limited stock 
exchange could be revived in the soviet union as early as next 
year 
but a fullfledged market will require both largescale 
privatization of state enterprises and widespread public education 
they said 
people in this country perhaps they could be persuaded to buy 
something intangible said dmitri tulin of the state bank known 
as gosbank they prefer to buy something substantial 
soviets have accumulated a vast horde of paper rubles over the 
years because high state subsidies and barren store shelves left 
them little to spend their money on 
soviet economists estimate the socalled ruble overhang at about 
250 billion rubles 440 billion at the official exchange rate 
although us experts say it is twice that 
a recent survey by the nedelya weekly publication found only 
half of the 6000 people it questioned had a bank account and only 
13 percent of them kept more than 1000 rubles in it 
the wall street experts said that if the soviet government wants 
to soak up those excess rubles and create tradeable shares it 
should begin selling off its wealth of state enterprises 
first on to the auction block should be profitable companies or 
those with good profit potential such as the aeroflot state 
airline the intourist travel agency or parts of the oil industry 
the americans said 
however finance minister valentin pavlov told a concluding news 
conference on wednesday that the government has no firm timetable 
for setting up a stock exchange or for widescale privatization 
like many government officials attending the threeday seminar 
he tried to put the brakes on the participants enthusiasm urging 
the 400 business people bankers researchers and academics to go 
slow and start small 
pavlov recommended that any new soviet stock exchange start 
trading in bonds rather than shares john chalsty who becomes 
nyse chairman next year said that was a logical first step until 
private companies can be formed 
it was my sense that a securities exchange can in fact be 
established in relatively short order that it can start trading 
securities mostly fixed income but that it will be a much slower 
process before you actually get stocks shares of ownership traded 
on that exchange chalsty said 
that will depend on the progress of privatization youve got 
to have something to trade before you can trade it and before you 
can have something to trade youve got to have an entity thats 
tradeable 
the soviet cabinet or council of ministers said in june that 
certain state enterprises could become joint stock companies and 
issue shares to individuals and institutions 
more than 400 companies mostly commercial banks already have 
seized the offer although in most cases the government has retained 
a majority interest without brokers a stock market or even 
facilities to print share certificates they havent even begun to 
trade over the counter 
a stock market flourished in st petersburg now leningrad 
for more than 200 years until it was closed by world war i stocks 
were outlawed after the bolshevik revolution a smaller moscow 
stock exchange existed near red square in a building now occupied 
by the chamber of commerce and there were more than 100 
commodities exchanges in czarist russia 
hungary has the only functioning stock exchange in eastern 
europe but trading has been light since it opened in budapest in 
june after a lapse of 42 years the polish government has prepared 
a draft law on securities and hopes to open a stock exchange next 
year

if it can be stirfried or microwaved a food 
item stands a better chance of getting attention from importers in 
prosperous asian countries says an agriculture department report 
consumer tastes are changing in the orient fast foods 
westernstyle meals and a growing interest in healthful diets are 
making an impact 
asian consumers are also returning to their culinary roots 
seeking out traditional foods but with a new twist 
convenience said violet oon a food editor in singapore the 
result is a desire for tradition in a packet that can be defrosted 
or microwaved 
oon writing in the november issue of agexporter magazine said 
the new trends of asian eating didnt develop overnight 
basically she said the changes in consumer tastes are linked 
to rising disposable income openness to imports a receptive news 
media and growth of the middle class 
singapore is on the leading edge in consumer tastes among 
the countries of southeast asia oon said 
as countries develop economically more and more consumers eat 
out as women join the work force and domestic help is hard to come 
by 
this has meant that home cooking is not what it once was 
oon said traditional cooking methods have been forgotten and 
cooking has gone instant 
for example freshly squeezed coconut milk in bottles 
deepfried shallots and prepeeled and precut onions for the 
preparation of traditional meals whether they are malay 
indonesian or singaporean 
anything traditional that can be prepackaged or premixed has 
a ready market oon said 
there is still another trendy wave among asians she said this 
is an obsession with health and nutrition particularly the use of 
cooking fats and their relationship to cholesterol 
even china has not been immune to this trend oon said 
representatives of the international edible oils industry report 
that the chinese have switched from lard to vegetable oil 
despite the emphasis on healthful eating habits oon said 
restaurants report that lowcalorie menus are generally shunned by 
asian customers yet the healthfood shops are doing well 
what this means is that when it comes to eating out the asian 
consumer still wants to eat sinfully she said its only when 
eating in the privacy of the home that the asian consumer is really 
concerned about health 
 
washington ap a recent big sale of cigarettes to the soviet 
union was good news for us tobacco farmers and served further 
notice of a growing dependence on overseas markets according to an 
agriculture department report 
two companies are selling 34 billion cigarettes to the soviets 
over the next two years the departments economic research service 
said in the october issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
the soviet deal is equal to nearly 25 percent of us 
cigarette exports in 1989 and appears to be only a forerunner of 
us cigarette trade with eastern european and newly industrialized 
countries the report said 
cigarette use in the united states declined 18 percent between 
1981 and 1990 due mainly to health concerns slipping social 
acceptance and rising prices meanwhile exports jumped from 83 
billion cigarettes in 1981 to 142 billion last year 
the export growth reflects lower trade barriers in japan taiwan 
and south korea other contributing factors were said to be the 
high quality of us cigarettes rising incomes in importing 
countries and the decline of the dollar against foreign currencies 
easter european countries also are showing more interest in us 
cigarettes the report said and the soviet sale is probably only 
the beginning of an important trade with the former communist bloc 
countries it said 
the sales to the soviet union may take 3 percent to 5 percent of 
us cigarette production within two years the report predicted 
this combined with potential sales to other east european 
countries such as czechoslovakia bulgaria and formerly east 
germany means that export sales stand to more than offset the 
steadily declining domestic market it said 
the net result it added could be that us cigarette and 
tobacco leaf production may stabilize or increase even with the 
big declines in domestic cigarette consumption 
 
washington ap farmers have reduced acreages of fresh market 
vegetable for harvest this fall by about 3 percent from a year ago

in all farmers expect to have 157900 acres for the fall 
harvest down from 163500 a year ago the report said

amoco oil co offered the highest bids and 
bought the most oil in the first sale from the us strategic 
petroleum reserve 
chicagobased amoco offered 3906 a barrel for 200000 barrels 
of the sweet crude oil and submitted the winning bids averaging 
3860 on a total of 112 million barrels of sweet crude 
president bush on sept 26 ordered the sale of oil from the 
reserves stored in underground salt domes in louisiana and texas 
saying he wanted to try hold down the oil prices that soared since 
the start of the middle east crisis 
except for a brief test the oil had not been put to use since 
the reserve was created in 1975 
the department asked for bids on five million of the 590 million 
barrels in the strategic petroleum reserve and received bids for 
104 million barrels 
the energy department said the remaining bids were too low 
because they didnt meet the congressional mandate that all bids be 
at least 90 percent of the market value of a barrel of crude 
all of the sweet crude that was offered was sold

the french chemical and pharmaceutical giant 
rhonepoulenc sa said thursday it will slash 3500 jobs from its 
brazilian workforce due to government austerity measures that are 
crimping business activity there 
voluntary layoffs are being conducted at the sao paolobased 
rhodia sa which makes chemicals fibers and medical products a 
company spokeswoman said 
people that leave simply wont be replaced she said 
about 2000 workers have already left since brazilian president 
fernando collor de mello instituted his antiinflation austerity 
program last year another 1500 are expected to go over the next 
two years the spokeswoman said 
rhonepoulencs firsthalf profits were off 13 percent from a 
year ago partly due to a 587 million loss at rhodia 
it was the first loss recorded by the brazilian division which 
had been a jewel in rhonepoulencs crown during the 1980s rhodia 
once accounted for 10 percent of revenue and an impressive 25 
percent of profits 
other french firms have suffered in brazil due to the stiff 
measures including eyeglass specialist essilor international sa 
and auto parts producer valeo sa 
the rhonepoulenc spokeswoman noted that the situation in brazil 
has improved since midsummer but said it would be three years 
before the company regained lost ground 
the job cuts at rhodia from 14000 to 10500 will free up 
funds that cashstrapped rhonepoulenc can use to offset its 2 
billion acquisition cost of usbased rorer group inc 
an economic slowdown in the united states has cast doubt on the 
profitmaking potential of the new unit rhonepoulenc rorer sa

a jury has awarded 1 million to dairy 
farmers who claimed a stray electrical current substantially cut 
their cows milk production 
the damages were awarded late tuesday to dale and gloria 
zumberge and their son steven following a 2week trial in sibley 
county district court 
the three had sued northern states power co claiming the 
utility failed to warn them about stray voltage errant 
electricity that enters the ground from grounded electrical 
distribution systems the three also said nsp failed to bring it 
under control once it was discovered 
it took a tremendous load off our shoulders dale zumberge 
51 said of the verdict he said he pressed the case partly out of 
pride to prove that his cows problems were not the result of poor 
management 
sam macalus nsp spokesman said the company was extremely 
disappointed with the verdict and may appeal he said nsps 
position is that the evidence in the case doesnt demonstrate the 
reduction in dairy production was due to stray voltage 
the problem of stray voltage was recognized by researchers in 
several nations as early as the 1940s they cited health dangers 
from current that flowed through the ground into barns and into 
the bodies of cows and dairy farmers 
the zumberges lawyer jim kaster said the family began 
automating its green isle farm in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
in 1984 after three years of declining milk production the 
zumberges read about stray voltage in a dairy magazine they called 
their milking company which did some tests nsp was called and 
the utility found 19 volts of electricity outside the barn other 
tests found 3 volts inside the barn 
kaster and experts testifying in behalf of the zumberges 
contended that the resulting irritation to the cows affected their 
ability to give milk 
in 1984 nsp put up a blocking device at the primary pole where 
electrical service arrives at the farm and that successfully 
halted the problem but kaster contended that when nsp put in a new 
transformer on that pole a few months later the blocking device 
was reinstalled incorrectly that problem was corrected last 
february with a dramatic increase in production the next month 
according to zumberge 
the zumberge will use the money to pay off creditors who 
accumulated as the milk production dropped kaster said

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca said he 
neither bemoaned money troubles nor tried to bargain with united 
auto workers leaders this morning as talks reopened between the 
union and automaker 
we had a nice hours discussion i gave them a 
stateoftheunion stateofthe company message iacocca said 
i didnt plead poverty i didnt bargain thats not my role 
iacocca said he told about 40 uaw leaders at the meeting in 
highland park that some parts of the agreement reached with general 
motors corp and ford motor co wont work for chrysler and he 
said the sides agreed to discuss them he refused to be specific 
chrysler and the uaw had suspended talks begun in midjuly while 
the uaw negotiated a contract with gm that pact was used as a 
pattern for an agreement reached with ford chrysler and the uaw 
resumed talks today 
uaw spokesman bob barbee said iacocca got a positive reception 
you didnt see him come down here with a bloody nose or anything 
did you barbee said 
meanwhile gm reached agreement late wednesday on a contract 
covering 22500 members of the international union of electronic 
workers pledging 250 million to guarantee job security 
also the union for 36500 canadian gm workers called off a 
strike 20 minutes before a midnight wednesday deadline citing 
progress in contract talks in toronto 
in detroit gm and union negotiators reached the tentative 
threeyear national contract at 830 pm wednesday hours ahead of 
a midnight strike deadline 
the union had been working under a contract that expired last 
month but told gm on sunday that it would cancel the pact and 
strike wednesday at midnight 
this is one of the best contracts we have ever negotiated 
iue negotiator frank sollitto said 
sollitto said the new pact guarantees job security for the iues 
22500 workers in ohio new york new jersey and mississippi 
through a 250 million fund 
it provides greater job security than ever before excellent 
improvements in our pension plan improved wages full protection 
against inflation a 600 christmas bonus every year of the 
contract and a fairer profit sharing formula sollitto said 
gm officials also praised the pact 
for these past three months bargainers from the company and 
the iue had to face a number of difficult and complex issues 
said alfred s warren jr gm vice president of industrial 
relations 
however the dedication and efforts of both sides of the 
bargaining table has resulted in an agreement that benefits both 
the corporation and the gm employees that are represented by the 
iue he said 
while the iues contract with gm which expired sept 14 was 
similar to the automakers pact with the united auto workers union 
the iue and uaw bargain separately last month gm reached a 
contract agreement with the uaw 
the gmiue agreement also includes 
across the board wage increases of 3 percent retroactive to 
sept 17 
special 30centsperhour increases for skilled trades 
workers retroactive to sept 17 
performance wage bonuses of 3 percent in the second and third 
years of the contract 
there were no concessions in this contract none sollitto 
said and we won the best job security protection anywhere in the 
industry 
workers at iue plants supply suspension systems electrical 
parts motors batteries windshield wipers and air conditioner 
compressors 
the last iue walkout against gm occurred in 1976 and lasted 10 
hours 
in toronto the canadian auto workers union said it was close to 
an agreement late wednesday with gm and hoped to settle early 
today 
the basis for the talks has been a contract the union reached 
with ford motor co of canada last month after a nineday strike

water is supposed to be cool clear healthy 
refreshing and if not free at least cheap 
but more and more people are paying serious money to have 
bottles of water delivered to thei homes saying they wonder about 
the safety of what flows out of the pipe or just dont like the 
taste 
lisa ehrlich for example says she pays 140 a month to have 
bottles of spring water home delivered in suburban bethesda md 
where she lives with her husband and their two children the 
ehrlichs go through a halfdozen fivegallon bottles every two 
weeks 
for our budget its a lot to pay but our water is important 
to us mrs ehrlich said it makes me nervous to drink city 
water plus it tastes great 
industry statistics show home delivery to be the fastestgrowing 
segment of a booming business outpacing water sales in restaurants 
and grocery stores as well as office deliveries 
a total of 4248 million gallons of water was delivered to 
american homes in 1989 an increase of 70 percent from the 1985 
figure of 2487 million gallons 
jane lazgin spokeswoman for the perrier group of america inc 
in greenwich conn said there are indications home delivery of 
water is more than a passing fad 
we find interest from kitchen designers who are building 
kitchens leaving space for the bottled water dispenser she said 
theres a certain novelty attached to it but its becoming more 
of a refreshment beverage choice 
the perrier group the biggest us bottled water company has 
three major domestic water brands great bear poland spring and 
arrowhead all available for home delivery its flagship perrier 
brand like other carbonated waters is not generally home 
delivered 
the average price for homedelivered water is 491 for a 
fivegallon bottle according to the international bottled water 
association the industrys trade association based in arlington 
va 
about 60 percent of bottled water buyers say theyre interested 
mainly in better taste the association said other reasons cited 
are safety and more specifically worries about chemicals in tap 
water 
the area where i live im not sure of the water supply said 
robert sims who has a fivegallon bottle of water delivered to the 
door of his onebedroom apartment in dallas every three weeks 
sims said he liked the taste of the bottled water but was 
motivated more by safety concerns 
therell be some brownish orangy color sometimes when he 
turns on the water sims said in a telephone interview ive been 
told that its absolutely safe but id rather not be drinking 
something that came out of those pipes 
federal regulations on public water systems set strict purity 
standards for dangerous chemicals and diseasecausing germs when 
the rules were tightened last year the environmental protection 
agency said the action could prevent up to 90000 waterborne 
diseases each year 
health issues however are dealt with carefully in bottled 
water advertisements and promotions 
ibwa members do not according to law make health claims 
about bottled water a statement from the association said 
however all bottled water must come from a governmentapproved 
source in addition because bottled water is a food product it 
must meet more stringent andadditional regulations than tap 
water 
critics of the industry contend that regulations are not tight 
enough to ensure that bottled water is free of contamination 
the environmental policy institute in washington issued a report 
last year concluding that there was a widespread misconception 
that the separate packaging and higher cost of bottled water 
guarantees a product substantially safer and healthier than 
ordinary tap water 
the report bottled water sparkling hype at a premium 
price urged consumers to ask for information about their normal 
water supply or have a sample tested before jumping to the 
conclusion that bottled water would be better 
mrs ehrlich said she was aware that contaminants had been found 
in some bottled waters she said her family was considering 
switching to a system that would distribute pure distilled water 
throughout the house 
who knows for sure if what youre getting is so great she 
said were trying to do the best but who knows the best might 
not be so good nowadays

manufacturer american motors corp withheld documents from the 
government in a deliberate coverup curry said chrysler corp 
acquired amc in 1987 
the safety probe was requested by public citizen the center for 
auto safety and the institute for injury reduction such 
investigations can lead to recalls 
they asked the agency to investigate what their petition 
described as the undue unnecessary and defective propensity of 
the cj vehicles to roll over 
the groups accused amc of knowing the vehicles suspension 
system was defective and their roll bar assembly inadequate 
curry said an exhaustive inquiry showed the jeep cjs likelihood 
to roll over was slightly higher than the average for all 
utility vehicles but the cj does not stand out from its peers to 
an extent that warrants further investigation he said 
deaths in cj rollover accidents totaled 116 in 1989 said 
michael brownlee the agencys associate administrator for 
enforcement 
amc sold 609356 cj5 and cj7 vehicles between 1972 and 1986 
when production was stopped an estimated 420000 are still 
registered for highway use 
the utility vehicle in general is less stable and more likely to 
roll over than a passenger car curry said it is narrow and has a 
short wheel base and high axles and suspension system 
for that reason the government requires manufacturers to attach 
a sticker to utility vehicles warning drivers to use extra caution 
but curry said people should be allowed to drive the vehicles if 
they wish

donald trump may be struggling to survive at the 
top but his second book seems to have lost the fight 
the new york times reported thursday that the book surviving 
at the top has tumbled off its bestseller list after only seven 
weeks the book which expounds upon his selfproclaimed triumphs 
and was published by random house is a sequel to the art of the 
deal which remained on the bestseller list for 48 weeks after 
its publication in 1987 
according to the times some booksellers believe far too many 
copies of the sequel were printed a random house spokesman said 
the publisher printed 500000 copies and sales have been very good 
still sales remain beneath the art of the deal of which 
nearly one million copies were sold 
perhaps the public has had its fill of the musings of the 
44yearold entrepreneur who has come to symbolize the image of 
the brash 1980s by surrounding himself with luxury and building an 
empire of real estate casinos and an airline on borrowed money 
all three of his businesses have slumped sharply because of a 
slowing economy 
trumps financial problems have been the object of repeated 
speculation in recent months including recurrent rumors that he 
will be forced to seek bankruptcy protection but trumps aides and 
some of his creditors have said they believe negotiations to 
stretch out his debt payments will succeed 
still more bad news surfaced thursday when the wall street 
journal reported trump will have to restructure more loans for his 
atlantic city gambling empire the negative account comes just days 
after forbes magazine bumped trump off its exclusive 400 richest 
americans list estimating his net worth to possibly be within 
hailing distance of zero 
the journal said trump has been forced to restructure 100 
million in bank loans to the trump castle and trump taj mahal 
casinos because they arent generating enough cash to repay that 
debt 
trump already is in negotations with bondholder groups to 
restructure 675 million in taj mahal debt two months ago he 
negotiated a 65 million bank bailout that was supposed to give him 
breathing room to repay his loans which together are believed to 
total more than 3 billion 
the journal quoted unidentified people close to trumps lenders 
as saying representatives of national westminster bank usa and 
midlantic national bank have been meeting with trump aides to 
restructure loans for the two atlantic city casinos and technically 
could foreclose on them if the debts arent paid each bank is owed 
approximately 50 million 
bank officials declined to comment trumps chief financial 
officer stephen bollenbach confirmed that talks are under way but 
disagreed with the characterization that the negotiations are a 
sign the developers operations have deteriorated further 
the way to look at this is weve got some very good business 
in atlantic city holding up very well in difficult times and they 
just arent quite good enough to cover currently all their debt 
service he said in a telephone interview 
i think everybody understands that bollenbach said its 
a temporary problem this is unlike other situations you read 
about where you have a basically flawed business 
takevover investor carl icahn declined to comment thursday on 
the journals account that he was believed to have bought trumps 
casino bonds as a longterm investment bollenbach said he had 
heard rumors of an icahn purchase but it didnt concern him 
i know mr icahn is a sophisticated bond investor i assume he 
bought them at a discount bollenbach said i suppose he sees 
value in them

the news from the nations biggest retailers thursday was pretty 
grim worries about recession and a possible war in the persian 
gulf kept consumers on the sidelines in september giving many 
storeowners a dismal september 
the retailers monthly sales reports some of which showed a 
decline from september 1989 levels did not augur well for a 
robust christmas shopping season 
i dont see anything to suggest an improvement said jeffrey 
edelman a retail industry analyst with barclays de zoete wedd 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co warned 
it could get worse we believe that for the first time in a 
long time we will have two very poor christmases back to back 
many retailers were forced to slash prices and consequently 
their profit margins to bring in sales last christmas feiner 
predicted earnings would decline again in the fourth quarter 
although many companies are being very cautious and preparing for 
the worst another bleak holiday season 
a slump in profits in the final quarter could be devastating for 
retailers who depend on this period for about 50 percent of their 
fullyear earnings 
septembers results came as no surprise august sales which 
normally are boosted by backtoschool shopping showed signs of a 
spending slowdown 
consumers were already nervous about the economy and the 
security of their own jobs when the persian gulf crisis and rising 
oil prices exacerbated recession fears and gave them less money to 
spend on socalled discretionary items such as clothes and 
furniture 
edelman called the middle east tensions the straw that broke 
the camels back 
the weather also affected sales as temperatures ran above the 
norm and few consumers were in the mood to shop for winter 
clothing 
feiner summed up the confluence of factors as a multifaceted 
barrage on the consumer 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck amp co said sales 
at stores open at least a year rose 44 percent for the five weeks 
ended oct 6 while sales from all of its stores rose 42 percent 
analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year also 
known as samestore or comparable store sales provide a truer 
picture of a retailers performance than overall sales do newer 
stores tend to have extraordinarily robust sales that can skew a 
retailers results 
k mart corp said its samestore sales inched up 07 percent 
although overall sales rose 102 percent 
walmart stores inc the discount retailer that consistently 
outperforms the rest of the industry reported a samestore sales 
gain of 9 percent and a 24 percent rise overall 
jc penney co inc said its samestore sales fell 34 percent 
while overall sales were off 23 percent 
dayton hudson corp reported a 2 percent decline in samestore 
sales although overall sales were up 113 percent 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
said its samestore sales dropped 3 percent while overall sales 
rose 10 percent 
thursdays reports also came as bad news for the economy as 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the gross 
national product a dropoff in spending adversely affects other 
economic sectors including manufacturers who sell merchandise to 
retailers 
retailers are playing a totally defensive ball game 
reducing their orders to suppliers said feiner 
the results announced thursday differ from the monthly retail 
sales report from the government the commerce department includes 
sales from supermarkets restaurants and car dealerships in its 
figures which are scheduled to be released friday morning 
in other reports from retailers thursday 
woolworth corp reported a 21 percent gain in samestore 
sales and a 62 percent rise overall 
may department stores co said its samestore sales fell 18 
percent while overall sales picked up 35 percent

labor leaders rallied thursday in support of 
establishing a national health insurance program to provide health 
care for working people and others who cannot afford to pay for it 
unions are calling for national health insurance as the best 
way to control health care costs improve the quality of care and 
make health care universally accessible said daniel radford 
executive secretarytreasurer of the cincinnati aflcio labor 
council 
the cincinnati rally was intended as part of a national aflcio 
campaign begun this month which includes television 
advertisements to promote a national health insurance program 
the aflcio says 37 million americans have no health care 
coverage and threequarters of those are working people and their 
families 
the national association of working americans an affiliate of 
the cincinnati aflcio labor council said it also intended the 
rally as a show of support for proposed ohio legislation to create 
universal health care programs 
the proposal by state rep robert hagan dyoungstown would 
phase out private insurance and replace it with a comprehensive 
plan for all citizens with no copayments or deductibles said 
sally krisel director of the association 
she said that as envisioned the proposed plan would cover 
everyone reduce the required insurance paperwork and allow 
participants their choice of doctors to perform the services the 
plan would be funded by taxes on payroll from employers and 
employees on interest and dividends and on alcohol and tobacco 
products 
hagan is redrafting his proposal and expects to formally 
introduce it before the ohio general assembly in january ms 
krisel said

the stock market took another beating today 
extending the decline that has driven it down to its lowest levels 
in nearly a year and a half 
analysts said there was little in the news to relieve the gloom 
that has gripped the market since midsummer 
the price of crudeoil for november delivery climbed about 1 a 
barrel to just under 40 a barrel in early trading on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
recession worries have kept mounting of late as investors await 
the peak flow of corporate earnings reports for the third quarter 
due over the next couple of weeks 
but economic weakness hasnt so far brought any downward 
pressure on longterm interest rates 
brokers also said market participants were frustrated by the 
slow progress and many twists and turns of efforts in washington 
toward a plan to narrow the federal budget deficit

general motors corp rolled out its 
new saturn cars thursday predicting they will lure more buyers 
from the competition than from other gm divisions 
gm created the saturn to compete with japanese imports that have 
stolen a large part of the market from the big three automakers 
the car has a price tag and fuel efficiency rating thats 
competitive with japanese models 
don hudler saturn corps vice president for sales and 
marketing said he expected 65 percent of the gm subsidiarys 
firstyear sales will be new business to gm the rest would come 
from current gm owners probably owners of chevrolets 
but by the third year saturn is on the market 80 percent of its 
sales will come from wouldbe buyers of imports or cars made by 
domestic rivals ford motor co and chrysler corp 
well do better as our perception gets out there hudler 
said after the official unveiling of saturns two and fourdoor 
cars the ceremony took place in spring hill tenn where the new 
cars are made 
auto analysts long have questioned saturns lofty expectations 
that a large number of its sales would come from import buyers 
saturns price range of 7995 to 11775 puts it in the same ball 
park as a host of imports as well as the geo prizm and the 
chevrolet cavalier both sold and serviced by chevrolet dealers 
snatching a sale from chevrolet may help saturn but does 
nothing for gms profits overall 
saturn was set up as a separate corporation within gm in january 
1985 and since then the new companys officials have been trying 
to distance themselves the saturn plant and the cars from the 
parent corporation 
no gm corporate officials were at thursdays official unveiling 
the ceremony which took place at the end of the assembly line at 
saturns plant 35 miles south of nashville appeared like a pep 
rally for the companys 3350 employees or team members as 
workers refer to themselves 
as a trio of new cars were driven off the line and into a 
shipping area hundreds of workers cheered 
about 1000 cars will be in dealerships or on their way when 
saturn officially goes on sale oct 25 in 30 retailers mostly in 
the south and west the company expects nationwide availability 
through about 130 dealerships a year from now 
three to four weeks before the cars arrive in each of the 
markets saturn will begin a print and broadcast advertising 
campaign featuring testimonials from company workers and an 
appearance by emmett a small blond dog belonging to one of 
saturns transplanted workers 
the television ads have a moody slightly sentimental air not 
all show the cars but the ads are designed to increase awareness 
of the saturn brand said luana floccuzio the companys 
advertising manager 
its getting into the hearts she said 
saturn has set an ambitious goal for itself when production is 
fully operational in about a year the company expects sales to 
reach about 250000 a year thats slightly less than the 255159 
honda civics that americans bought in the 1990 model year that 
ended last month 
in price the saturn also is positioned against the ford escort 
mazda protege nissan sentra toyota corolla dodge shadow and 
plymouth sundance 
saturn is including a roadside assistance plan and a buyback 
program for owners 
hudler said the cars will carry no incentives 
the company already is working on new saturns perhaps including 
a station wagon and a convertible

date 
the executives were joined by united auto workers officials at 
the ceremony bobby lee thompson assistant director of uaw region

but more important i believe in you the american public 
thompson said to more cheers 
mcwherter who was state house speaker when gm announced in 1985 
that saturn was coming to spring hill 35 miles south of nashville 
recalled that his father moved their family from tennessee to 
michigan in search of work in the auto industry 
i want to acknowledge the thousands and thousands of gm 
stockholders for their commitment to tennessee he said

g skip lefauve said later 
he would not give production figures but said the plant should 
reach capacity of 250000 cars a year by end of 1991

mci communications corp offered the federal 
government a plan thursday to put a hold on telemarketers who 
switch phone customers longdistance service without their 
permission 
this customer switching known as slamming has generated 
tens of thousands of complaints to state and federal telephone 
regulators particularly in the wake of recent advertising wars 
between mci us sprint and american telephone amp telegraph co 
with all three leading longdistance carriers now offering about 
the same prices they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars 
on advertising and telemarketing trying to lure customers from 
their rivals 
atampt has about 65 percent of the market mci about 14 percent 
and sprint about 10 percent with the remainder taken by several 
hundred smaller companies atampt had about 90 percent of the market 
when it was broken up in 1984 
mci called on the federal communications commission to establish 
uniform minimum disclosures in all telephone sales solicitations 
monitor procedures for phone solicitors independently verify sales 
to insure the customer has authorized a change in service conduct 
independent audits and ensure free and convenient return to the 
original longdistance carrier in the case of unauthorized service 
conversion 
customers typically pay 5 to change services now 
eugene eidenberg mci executive vice president said the plan 
will create a national standard to protect consumers while still 
preserving the competition that has brought them better service in 
the longdistance industry at lower prices 
mci said its proposal should supersede a rival atampt proposal to 
the fcc that would require each customer to sign a form prior to 
being switched to a new longdistance carrier 
atampt in january sued mci and mcis telemarketing agent pioneer 
teletechnologies of sergeant bluff iowa over slamming claiming 
the companies had used misleading or false information to persuade 
atampt customers to switch to mci 
mci and pioneer both denied any wrongdoing and the suit is 
pending in us district court in washington 
when the lawsuit was filed mci said 100000 atampt customers a 
week were switching to mci because it offered better service but 
atampts suit said mci agents were telling atampt customers that mci 
was merging with atampt or that atampt was going out of business 
telemarketers according to industry analysts often prey on the 
elderly the hard of hearing or those who dont speak english well 
fcc rules now require only that longdistance carriers provide 
local phone companies with written verification from customers if 
the local phone company asks for proof 
the house government operations subcommittee on government 
information justice and agriculture will hold hearings on slamming 
next wednesday according to aides to the subcommittees chairman 
rep bob wise dwva

dwindling us stockpiles looming cold weather 
and a british warning of a persian gulf conflagration combined to 
drive oil prices back over 40 a barrel thursday to a new record 
close in hectic futures trading 
its a market that reacts emotionally said bob baker an 
oiltrading specialist at prudentialbache securities inc in new 
york its going to stay that way as long as we have 200000plus 
troops out there 
on the new york mercantile exchange the novemberdelivery price 
of light sweet crude the benchmark grade of oil jumped 173 a 
barrel to close at 4042 eclipsing the previous record of 4040 
set tuesday laterdelivery months also advanced strongly 
the rise erased the decline a day earlier when traders dumped 
oil contracts on an unfounded rumor about the death of saddam 
hussein 
the iraqi leaders seizure of neighboring kuwait more than two 
months ago led to an unprecedented us military buildup in the 
petroleumrich region and has doubled the price of oil since 
midsummer 
refined products traded on the exchange also surged thursday 
the most notable increase was in wholesale home heating oil for 
november delivery which jumped 380 cents a gallon to 10485 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for november delivery jumped 24 
cents a gallon to close at 96 cents and natural gas rose 2 cents 
per 1000 cubic feet to 196 
oilmarket strategists said buyers plunged in at the opening of 
trading motivated partly by a report from the american petroleum 
institute released after the close of trading wednesday 
api an industry trade group said its weekly tally of domestic 
supplies showed a 42 million barrel drop in crude stockpiles and a 
15 million barrel drop in distillates which includes heating oil 
the declines were considered unusually steep particularly at a 
time when seasonal demand for energy to heat homes is increasing 
the report aggravated fears that the united states which 
imports half its oil was growing more vulnerable to shortages as 
the chances of a persian gulf war increased which could cut off 
oil supplies completely from that area 
britains foreign secretary douglas hurd heightened war fears in 
the oil pits by telling fellow politicians in britain that force 
would be used to evict the iraqis from kuwait if they didnt leave 
voluntarily 
hurd said that without a united front against iraq then we 
shall be back in a world of anarchy punctuated by explosions of 
force 
thomas blakeslee an energy analyst at the pegasus econometric 
group in hoboken nj said the rhetoric unnerved professional 
traders even though hurds remarks were basically no different 
than warnings the united states has issued to iraq 
traders dont sit down and think about that type of thing 
blakeslee said they dont have time

recession fears have sent silver and platinum 
plummeting in the last two days and analysts say silver isnt 
looking quite like the precious metal it used to be 
the spot price of silver fell 255 cents or 56 percent to 
428 a troy ounce on thursday from a late bid of 4535 in london 
wednesday 
thursdays late price was the lowest for silver since 1976 when 
the metal dipped as low as 382 according to shearson lehman 
brothers ltd 
its no longer a precious metal its an industrial metal 
said nick hatch a mining analyst at the london investment firm 
james capel and co 
both silver and platinum are suffering from mounting fears of 
an economic downturn added thomas butler a precious metals 
analyst at the london investment firm samuel montagu and co 
both these metals have very strong industrial bases and fears 
that a recession may emerge soon are obviously undermining 
prices he said 
the spot price of platinum fell 2350 or 53 percent to 
41875 an ounce in london from 44225 an ounce late wednesday 
that was its lowest since 1985 when the price reached 244 
shearson said 
silver rose as high at 35 an ounce in 1980 when the hunt 
brothers of texas tried to corner the silver market hatch said it 
has fallen fairly steadily since 
analysts said silver is hurting lately because of the economic 
downturn thats affecting consumers to manufacturers silver is 
most widely used in the photographic industry where demand is 
down hatch said silverware is a luxury item thats also coming 
under pressure from the economic slowdown he said 
theres also an abundance of silver about 70 percent is 
produced as a byproduct of gold and other mining butler said that 
means supply doesnt respond to changes in demand 
silver mines in chile alaska and nevada also are increasing 
production and theres a lot of scrap being recovered hatch said 
this years total demand will come to 14850 tons surpassing 
expected supply of 14400 tons hatch said but he said theres a 
stockpile of roughly 10000 tons 
in the past investors tended to snap up oversupply butler 
said but thats no longer the case he said 
the longterm love affair with silver seems to be over he 
said

as public concern mounts over the volume of 
packing materials sandwich boxes and yogurt containers en route to 
landfills plastic industry leaders have been thinking more about 
recycling to make the industrys outlook a little greener 
in a recent survey nearly 20 percent of midwestern plastic 
industry leaders ranked environmental issues as having the greatest 
future impact on manufacturing the survey conducted by the 
chicagobased gary siegel organization for the investment firm of 
berger goldstein capital group inc found that the 6500 
industry executives polled cited solid waste disposal ecological 
concerns and biodegradable products as top concerns 
i think its a combination of the industry being responsible 
and realizing that consumers are looking for these kind of 
recyclable products said bailey condrey jr spokesman for the 
council for solid waste solutions 
the companies want to maintain their market share by providing 
what customers want said condrey whose washingtonbased council 
consists of 26 plasticproducing companies 
but some environmentalists say the solution is cutting the 
initial use of plastics not reusing them 
i dont think recycling plastics is the total answer to the 
waste disposal problem said kevin greene a researcher with the 
chicagobased citizens for a better environment first we must 
cut down on the excessive use of packaging plastic or otherwise 
plastic recycling today involves mostly food service and 
packaging products made of polystyrene plastic said james 
schneiders president of national polystyrene recycling co in the 
late 1980s his company opened one of the nations first 
polystyrene recycling plants in leominster mass 
in recycling the materials are cleaned and ground into resin 
pellets which then are used alone or in combination with virgin 
materials to produce plastic products 
were really benefiting society in two ways by reusing 
materials that still have life in them and by cutting the use of 
primary material schneiders said 
environmentalists still have doubts because plastic products 
are so bulky they are difficult to collect and transport for 
recycling greene said he also said food and drug administration 
regulation prohibits the use of recycled products in most food 
packaging 
we still favor the use of glass and aluminum greene said 
those products can be recycled into the same food and beverage 
containers 
some waste disposal experts say plastics in landfills arent 
that big a problem however 
plastics are among the most innocuous materials in 
landfills said allen blakey spokesman for the national solid 
waste management association in many ways theyre the perfect 
item to put into landfill because they dont decay and produce 
toxic byproducts 
blakey said about 20 percent or 144 million tons of the waste 
put in landfills in 1988 came from plastics paper products were 
the largest contributor with 34 percent he said

chemical banking corp reporeed a 437 million 
thirdquarter loss thursday and cut its dividend by more than half 
another sign of painful times in the domestic banking business 
the loss by the nations 6thlargest banking company was an 
improvement over a year earlier but still reflected the rise in 
shaky loans and a softening economy that have afflicted several 
leading us banks in recent months 
chemical bank is struggling as are other banks with a 
deteriorating operating environment and the declining real estate 
market in the northeast said james mcdermott a banking analyst 
at keefe bruyette amp woods a new york investment firm 
chemical said the results stemmed primarily from a 250 million 
increase in its reserves for loan losses and a 188 million 
accounting charge to cover the cost of shutting down its securities 
trading business in switzerland and japan a move that had been 
announced previously 
it also reported an improvement in the texas commerce bancshares 
subsidiary which earned 229 million by contrast texas commerce 
lost 3724 million in the yearearlier quarter which contributed 
to a loss of 8246 million by the parent company during that 
period 
chemical said it dropped the quarterly dividend from 68 cents a 
share to 25 cents to retain a higher level of common equity to 
support consistent growth in its profitable core businesses 
the dividend cut had not been unexpected several leading banks 
notably no 2 chase manhattan have taken the painful step of 
cutting dividends recently to help strengthen their financial 
structures 
for the first nine months of 1990 chemical said it earned 
2211 million or 183 a share vs a loss of 5781 million in 
the yearearlier period 
the bank of new york meanwhile said it earned 71 million or 
90 cents a share in the third quarter ended sept 30 vs a 271 
million loss a year earlier 
the 11thlargest us banking company said it attributed the 
performance partly to an improvement in efficiency stemming from 
its acquisition of irving bank corp in 1989 
still the bank said earnings were hurt by shaky real estate 
loans and latin american debt which led the company to increase 
its loanloss provision by 113 million 
for the nine months ended sept 30 net income was 243 million 
compared with a loss of 56 million for the same period last year

rejected three times in state courts lawyers 
for charles h keating jr asked a federal court judge thursday to 
reduce the jailed financiers 5 million bail 
the district attorneys office did not offer a shred of 
evidence to support a finding that keating is a flight risk the

misleading investors about the security of junk bonds sold at the

ual corp on thursday offered employees a 
discount stockpurchase program that union officials said could 
give workers a 20 percent stake in the airline company 
the board of directors earlier this week rebuffed the unions 
bid for full employee ownership 
ual spokesman joe hopkins said he did not know if the 20 percent 
limit to the stock ownership cited by the unions is correct nor 
did he know how much stock employees now own 
the company made a brief reference to the stock plan in a letter 
to employees on wednesday then added a few details in a bulletin 
board announcement on thursday 
it said that shortly after the first of the year employees will 
be offered ual stock at a 15 percent discount from the market 
price in addition the company will offer expanded stockpurchase 
rights to salaried and management employees 
we believe these changes will be attractive for employees who 
wish to acquire united stock and share in the future successes of 
united through ownership said paul george senior vice president 
for human resources 
the three principal unions representing united airlines 
employees expressed reservations about the plan 
it is ironic that ual proposes to sell 20 percent of its stock 
to its employees at a discount only two days after rejecting our 
offer to buy all of the stock at a significant premium above the 
current market price heads of the pilots machinists and flight 
attendants unions said in a statement 
they said that while they favor employee ownership of stock 
managements proposal for limited stock ownership raises numerous 
issues which must be addressed in negotiations 
tuesdays rejection of a bid for full employee ownership marked 
the fourth failed takeover attempt in 3 years 
the employee group was unable to arrange financing by the 
tuesday deadline for the 201ashare 438 billion offer the 
board accepted in principle in april 
despite the lack of bank financing the buyout group presented 
the board with two other offers both of which were rejected

an arbitrator thursday ruled intel 
corp did not act in good faith in a dispute with advanced micro 
devices over the rights to intels highly profitable 386 
microprocessor 
the arbitrator retired superior court judge j barton phelps 
however stopped short of ordering intel to transfer the chips 
rights to amd phelps said remedies will be considered in a hearing 
to begin nov 15 
both sides claimed victory in the dispute over a 1982 contract 
under which the companies were to trade technology 
advanced micro initiated the arbitration seeking to require 
intel to transfer products including the 386 chip rights to amd 
and also asked for 1 billion in damages 
intel has contended that amd failed to develop acceptable 
products under the agreement and therefore is not entitled to 
take any intel products 
phelps decided that intel had provided a classic example of a
