solidarity and government negotiators said 
tuesday that talks on political and economic reform were threatened 
by the failure of the official trade union alliance to agree on a 
plan to index wages to prices to protect workers incomes 
but both sides expressed hope that agreement still could be 
reached the representatives made their comments in separate 
statements carried by the staterun news agency pap early tuesday 
solidarity leader lech walesa and other top solidarity leaders 
and advisers appeared exhausted after they returned to the roman 
catholic episcopate after 10 hours of talks with interior minister 
gen czeslaw kiszczak and other top government and officials from 
opzz the official trade union alliance 
the situation is relatively dramatic the talks are not 
finished we will continue them today of course there are still 
chances even big ones walesa told reporters waiting outside the 
episcopate 
pap also said the talks would continue tuesday 
it was the second time in less than a week that top 
representatives of both sides met at a government residence in 
magdalenka south of warsaw to discuss issues blocking progress at 
the talks which began feb 6 
the key outstanding issue appears to be a solidarity proposal to 
index wages to prices to protect workers incomes against inflation 
the executive committee of the opzz on monday opposed the 
solidarity plan and called for a lump sum indexation of wages 
the executive committee does not accept the method of 
indexation of wages compensating for only 80 percent of price 
increases particularly as this has been conditioned on the wage 
capacities of work places an opzz statement said 
the opzz warned against the social consequences which the 
introduction of indexation mechanisms agreed by solidarity and 
the authorities could have it does not contribute to a cooling 
down of unrest but can even lead to its aggravation 
solidarity charged that the opzz position presented the state 
of negotiations and the stand of solidarity in a lying and 
irresponsible way 
the solidarity statement also accused the opzz of trying to 
break down the round table and destroying an apparent chance to 
save the country they opzz are playing with poland 
the banned union called on the government to stop raising prices 
until indexation is introduced and called for the legalization of 
solidarity as soon as possible 
however the statement ended on an optimistic note 
solidarity states it is possible to lead the round table to 
the end it lies in polands interests solution of the present 
situation depends on the consequences and imagination of polish 
political authorities 
the government side also expressed its concern over the stance 
of the opzz saying in a statement that solutions proposed in the 
opzz resolution threaten the economy create a danger of social 
conflicts and seriously hinder the process of the round table 
the group that accompanied walesa included journalist tadeusz 
mazowiecki and historian bronislaw geremek union leaders zbigniew 
bujak and wladyslaw frasyniuk political theorists adam michnik and 
jacek kuron as well as gdansk bishop tadeusz goclowski and rev 
alojzy orszulik 
wednesday is the tentative date set for the final agreement on 
legalizing solidarity and introducing a package of political and 
economic reforms according to a communique issued after a meeting 
between the sides march 29 
but solidarity spokesmen have expressed doubt that the target 
can be met 
three groups on economic political and trade union reforms are 
scheduled to meet tuesday mazowiecki said the further top level 
meeting could be held after the conclusion of those discussions 
the broad outline of an agreement was reached some time ago 
in exchange for legalization of solidarity and other independent 
groups that were banned after the december 1981 martial law 
crackdown the opposition would agree to participate in june 
parliament elections that would guarantee the communist party and 
its allies 65 percent of the 460 seats 
a presidency and a senate of about 100 members would be created 
the opposition would be expected to win the senate which would be 
picked in an open democratic vote 
the president would likely be a member of the communist party 
and would be elected jointly by parliament and the senate given the 
strength of the communist party and its allies in the larger 
parliament 
the opposition also would have access to mass media including a 
daily newspaper and two weeklies and at least one program a week on 
national tv and radio 
the opposition wants the authorities to agree to a formula of 
indexing workers wages to compensate for polands unabating 
inflation which topped 60 percent last year 
authorities proposed talks last august during the years second 
nationwide wave of crippling industrial strikes 
they hope agreement will provide poland with political and labor 
stability so economic reforms designed to combat polands 39 
billion foreign debt they also hope agreement will persuade the 
west to invest in poland

portauprince haiti ap government forces on monday battled 
mutinous soldiers who demand the release of an alleged coup leader 
and at least four rebels were killed radio stations and witnesses 
reported 
the fighting began after members of the elite leopards battalion 
occupied the airport several of them roamed the capital shooting 
in the air and shouting get off the streets the city belongs to 
us 
residents stayed home and businesses and schools were closed 
streets were littered with burning tires but it was not known who 
set them on fire 
the leopards took over the government television and radio 
stations at 330 pm and halted broadcasts 
the shooting between guardsmen and leopards broke out monday 
afternoon when the two sides confronted each other driving on 
delmas road a main commercial throughfare in the capital 
radio stations gave varying reports on casualties from four to 
eight killed and eight wounded the reports could not be confirmed 
radio metropole an independent station said 300 demonstrators 
supporting the leopards paraded down delmas road shouting 
antigovernment slogans demanding avril resign and erecting 
barricades of flaming tires 
in the afternoon several leopards made three demands over the 
independent radio station haitiinter they said they want alleged 
coup leader lt col himmler rebu released a civilian government 
to replace avril and the complete restoration of the 1987 
constitution which was suspended last june 
the constitution has 37 articles which mostly limit the role of 
the army 
us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde said the rebels occupied 
haitis international airport which remained closed 
everything is calm except for the leopards she said they 
say they want rebu released and thats the standoff 
the leopards were created in the 1960s by ousted dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier and are the best trained and most professional 
in the military as opposed to others in the 7000man army the 
leopards have not been associated with human rights violations 
sources have said rebu and the other three led the attempt 
sunday to overthrow lt gen prosper avril the military ruler put 
in office by a coup six months ago 
avrils government removed rebu from command of the leopards and 
put him under military guard at an undisclosed location the fates 
of the other three alleged coup leaders were not known 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said we are pleased that president avrils authority has been 
restored us policy objectives for haiti remain the promotion of 
democratic reform respect for human rights credible economic 
development programs and cooperation on narcotics issues 
president avril has made significant progress on this agenda 
in the last six months and the united states government will 
continue to support his efforts as the process moves forward 
loyal soldiers in tanks rescued avril as he was being driven to 
the airport sunday night in handcuffs to be flown into exile it 
would have been the impoverished caribbean nations third coup in 
less than a year 
he made a televised speech soon after midnight flanked by 
soldiers in battle gear but gave no details of the coup attempt 
he blamed it on some members of the army forces blinded by their 
exorbitant ambitions but said he still had faith in the army 
how many of the battalions 300 members were involved in the 
mutiny monday was not known 
motives for sundays coup remained unclear but it appeared 
linked to the arrest last week of four ranking army officers who 
have been accused of drug trafficking 
fritz longchamp director of the washington office on haiti 
research group said by telephone that rumors had circulated in the 
military that avril had a long list of officers to be fired in a 
crackdown on narcotics and corruption 
he said four of those were rumored to be the coup leaders rebu 
col guy francois commander of the dessalines barracks behind the 
presidential palace col phillipe biambey commander of the palace 
guard and col george valcin police chief of portauprince 
longchamp said the coup attempt ended after the government 
negotiated the release of hostages held at the leopards camp at 
least five people were believed held at one stage including 
avrils wife marieange one of their sons and the defense and 
interior minister acedius st louis 
louis dejoie a moderate politician said pressure for a coup 
had grown for a month and dismissal of the army officers was the 
last straw 
the united states made a crackdown on drug trafficking a 
condition for restoring 70 million in aid suspended after the 
abortive elections of 1987 during which thugs killed 34 voters

the old people make their way in ones or 
twos across the cobbled street down the steps to the church 
basement and the registration tables 
there they pour out tearful horrifying stories of brutal work 
in freezing conditions a daily ration of less than one pound of 
watery bread and relatives who did not make it back from the 
wastelands of siberia 
the stories have been repeated thousands of times since january 
as people register for membership in the newly legalized union of 
siberiaks polish slang for people deported to siberia or more 
generally to the soviet union during the stalinist era 
siberiaks are coming into the open after decades of silence 
because of a changed political climate that permits them to speak 
publicly about wrongs committed against them by soviet secret 
police and their polish helpers 
there are people who come now and say they spent eight years 
there 10 years 14 years two or three times more than the entire 
war that is what so terrible about it said ryszard reiff 
president of the association 
if one travels for six weeks in a boxcar built for cattle 
during such travel out of 90 people locked up in a car 20 died and 
were thrown out small children are freezing or suffocating in 
the car and then those tiny bodies are simply thrown out 
can one ever forget a thing like this 
according to reiff about 15 million poles were deported deep 
into the soviet union between 1939 and the early 1950s 
most of the deportations came soon after the soviets invaded 
poland from the east in september 1939 while nazi germany was 
invading from the west the two powers had secretly agreed to 
partition poland in the ribbentropmolotov nonaggression pact of 
august 1939 
a smaller wave of deportations took place at the end of the war 
when the red army won back control of poland from the nazis and 
the soviet nkvd secret police arrived to sweep away any possible 
resistance to communist control of postwar poland 
of those deported about 500000 poles died in the soviet union 
500000 remained there or emigrated to other countries and 500000 
eventually returned to poland reiff said 
reiff said he was an underground resistance officer who was 
caught by the soviets in 1944 and sent away for two years until he 
escaped and walked back to poland he remembers siberia as a 
strange and terrible country 
there they care neither about space nor about time 
siberia is big even the soviet soldiers wore unhemmed coats they 
wore endless coats like the endless land and they didnt care 
about time either they would say for five minutes and it lasted 
five years 
reiff was asked to lead the siberiaks by a group of about 20 
people who won permission from communist authorities to organize 
the union in december 1988 a former head of the catholic political 
group pax the 65yearold journalistpolitician is known in poland 
as the man who was removed from the council of state after he was 
the only member to protest martial law in 1981 
since the unions first meeting jan 13 6000 people have 
registered in warsaw alone and a bigger group has formed in the 
southwestern city of wroclaw said group spokesman jerzymarek 
wlodarek a nationwide membership count has not been completed 
some members have shocking accounts one man reported being sent 
to siberia as late as 1953 when deportations of poles were thought 
to have ended another wrote claiming to have seen polish officers 
being taken to their executions by the nkvd predecessor of the 
kgb at katyn in 1940 
although the polish government has begun to admit soviet guilt 
for the massacre of polish officers at katyn and there have been 
several pieces in the official press about siberian deportations 
such topics remain very sensitive 
siberiaks seem to care little about eventual compensation for 
pension and disability payments for these imprisonments their main 
interest seems to be speaking loudly about the crimes against them 
so that they are not forgotten 
the truth finally comes out that not only germans were killing 
poles but somebody else was too said one elderly woman at st 
andrews church moments after enrolling in the union 
i was 10 years old and went to siberia with my mother brother 
and sister and before that they arrested my father for having 
volunteered in 1920 to fight with poland in a war against the 
fledgling soviet union 
her father was put in a camp at kotlas she said there were 
thousands of poles killed there they were leading people into the 
woods and those people never came back they were murdering them 
there like in katyn 
taken from her home near bialystok in 1940 she did heavy labor 
for four years until her release at age 14 
whitehaired jadwiga cieslicka came to the union in march 
clutching a bound typewritten manuscript and scrapbook by her late 
husband kazimierz recounting his fate and that of his fellow 
villagers taken to siberia 
she opened it delicately to show a letter he wrote his mother on 
a scrap of brown paper and photos of 21 men from his village who 
had been arrested 
this is the moment where it first sees daylight said mrs 
cieslicka up to now i could not show it to anybody i want to 
reveal everything my husband left so it is not forgotten 
her husband who died two years ago lived in urzedow a village 
near lublin in eastern poland he fought along with other men of 
the village in the home army against the germans 
in 44 when the soviets came in he was taken away and it 
was totally unexpected because they thought they were fighting the 
same enemy she said 
he and his brother were put to work as miners for two years 
it was in siberia where they have white bears and temperatures of 
40 degrees below zero she said with a shudder 
their son jaroslaw a doctor says conditions in siberia 
hastened his fathers death 
we can speak about it out loud now its wonderful that there 
is this union he said 
it cant be forgotten the people who did it who killed our 
fathers they should be held responsible

portauprince haiti ap the government said it foiled an 
attempt sunday to overthrow lt gen prosper avril and us 
officials said loyal troops apparently rescued avril as he was 
being driven away to be deported 
avril told the nation early monday in a televised address that 
rebel soldiers blinded by their exorbitant ambition attempted 
to overthrow his government and appealed to haitians to support his 
leadership 
he did not provide details of attempted coup or say how it was 
foiled there were no reports of casualties 
a government communique read earlier over staterun television 
said certain officers besieged the presidential palace and 
attempted to overthrow the government 
presidential guardsmen told journalists avril was taken captive 
at his mansion in canape verte a wealthy neighborhood in the hills 
overlooking the capital as he returned home from a party early 
sunday 
sources said four military officers had tried to overthrow 
avril who assumed power six months ago in this impoverished 
caribbean countrys second coup in less than a year 
in his 10minute speech avril said at a time when the 
government is doing its utmost to ensure democratic progress and 
economic recovery once again the stability of the haitian nation 
was threatened 
he was flanked by at least a dozen soldiers dressed in battle 
gear including sgt major joseph heubreux who led the coup by 
noncommissioned officers who put avril in power last september 
on the night of april 1 and 2 some members of the armed 
forces blinded by their exorbitant ambitions attempted to overthrow 
the government which i assumed sept 17 1988 as commander and chief 
of the armed forces and president of the military government 
avril said 
us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde said earlier that reports 
indicated the coup attempt occurred about 4 am and that avril was 
detained for a time 
but it appears that when he was being taken to the airport to 
be deported members of the presidential guard arrived at the 
airport and escorted him back to the palace to be president 
again she said in a telephone interview 
she said the attempted coup was totally bloodless 
however radio liberte quoted an unidentified soldier as 
portauprince would be set on fire unless the government 
released one of the alleged coup leaders identified by the soldier 
as lt col himmler rebu commander of the leopards battalion 
commando unit 
military sources said rebu was under military guard at the 
national palace 
loyal soldiers told journalists that avrils wife marieange 
and her mother were taken captive with avril but released a couple 
hours later 
they also said two of avrils brothers and interior minister 
col acedius st louis and his son were seized by the rebels 
avrils son brothers and st louis and his son reportedly were 
freed after two tanks rolled into the leopards barracks and 
negotiated their release sunday night there were no reports of 
casualties 
initial reports had said the army commander maj gen herard 
abraham was among the coup leaders but later accounts said that 
was not correct and that the plot collapsed when abraham refused 
the rebels offer of the presidency 
abraham was foreign minister under the government of lt gen 
henri namphy who avril replaced 
the attempt came four days after the discharge of four top army 
officers accused of drug trafficking 
unconfirmed reports said four army officers planned the coup 
including gen guy francois commander of the dessalines barracks 
in portauprince which is the base of the most feared unit in 
haitis 7000man army the reports said all four officers had been 
detained but there was no confirmation 
in washington state department spokesman dennis harter said the 
situation in haiti remains fluid 
haitis international airport was closed and large numbers of 
soldiers were at the palace and on the streets which were calm 
gunfire was heard twice near the palace in the predawn hours 
several hours later there was another spurt of gunfire in the same 
area 
five soldiers of the presidential guard arrived at independent 
radio station liberte at 1145 am and read a statement denying 
avril was ousted 
there has not been any visible reaction from the people ms 
clyde said the streets are very calm people are going about 
their business as usual 
richard melton us deputy assistant secretary of state for 
caribbean affairs visited haiti last monday and told avril 
resumption of us aid depended in part on haitis efforts to crack 
down on the narcotics trade 
on wednesday four top army officers accunvolvement in 
the drug trade were discharged 
ay a conservative political leader said those 
dismissals mighriggered the coup attempt 
leslie manigat haitis last civ president was elected in

japan is showing off its lead in a new generation 
of television technology this week beaming a national high school 
baseball tournament to viewers in cinemaquality 
highdefinition images 
for an hour a day during the 10day tournament japans public 
television network nhk is broadcasting via satellite the wider 
crystalclear pictures with sound quality similar to that of 
compact discs 
millions of japanese were expected to watch the tournament but 
only viewers watching on a few hundred specially equipped sets will 
see the sharper images 
because of the extra screen width a broadcast of a baseball 
game can show the pitcher winding up to throw to a batter and 
runners on first and third base all in the same picture said 
sosuke yasuma director of highdefinition tv programs for nhk 
tv cameramen will need to relearn how to compose their pictures 
the new technology creates its dramatically sharper images by 
using about twice as many horizontal scanning lines and five times 
as much video information as current television 
industry officials say the technology known as hdtv will 
revolutionize other industries that deal with images such as 
printing graphic design and moviemaking 
some parts of the olympic games in seoul south korea were 
broadcast on hdtv last fall but this weeks broadcast represents 
the beginning of regular programming 
nhk next plans to broadcast a twoweek sumo wrestling tournament 
in may and then begin regular hourlong daily hdtv transmissions in 
june 
although few people will be watching at first the special 
monitors now cost about 60000 and only several hundred have been 
made the broadcasts demonstrate japans lead over the united 
states and europe in the race to commercialize hdtv technology 
at stake nhk says are potential worldwide hdtv sales estimated 
at 80 billion by 1995 
in addition countries that dont develop hdtv industries will 
have difficulty competing in a wide range of future commercial and 
military products analysts say hdtv ties together a variety of 
advanced technologies including digital image processing 
highcapacity satellite transmission fiber optics and 
microelectronics 
because of potential military applications such as in image 
sensors for missiles or spy satellites the us department of 
defense announced in december a 30 million program of grants to 
develop an american hdtv system 
but us industry officials and some congressmen call the 
pentagon program too little too late 
the united states should have gotten into this long ago 
said john stern who represents us electronics associations in 
japan japan has already commercialized this technology while 
the united states today is approximately six years behind 
japanese makers are so far ahead of us companies that they 
could quickly dominate the us market if their system gains 
international acceptance in the near future stern said 
engineers at nhk began in the 1960s to develop an improved tv 
system they hoped would unify the worlds seven current tv systems 
since then under nhk leadership japanese companies reportedly 
have spent more than 700 million on hdtv development with little 
government involvement 
in a crash program over the last two years european companies 
designed and produced a separate hdtv system the european economic 
community wants to begin consumer hdtv equipment sales and 
satellite broadcasts by 1992 
recently south korea announced it will spend about 150 
million including 90 million from private companies in a 
fouryear effort to develop an hdtv industry 
but while european and south korean companies have remained 
strong in consumer electronics american companies would need to 
rebuild an industry they largely abandoned or sold to foreign firms 
except for zenith electronics all major television factories in 
the united states are now owned by overseas companies 
while hdtv will be broadcast in japan and europe directly from 
satellites on special frequencies federal communications 
commission standards say us hdtv broadcasts must use current tv 
channels and be viewable on present televisions but special hdtv 
monitors would still be necessary for the improved picture quality 
both japan and europe still hope their systems will be adopted 
worldwide at least for professional studio equipment such as video 
tape recorders and cameras 
we still wish japan would see the wisdom of a single world 
system based on the european standard rather than trying to impose 
a noncompatible system on the rest of the world said michael 
lake spokesman for the eec in japan

crews today searched for more bodies in 
the rainswollen hatchie river where at least seven people plunged 
to their deaths after a 60footsection of a halfcenturyold 
bridge collapsed 
months of flooding on the hatchie may have eroded the foundation 
of a bridge pier causing the us 51 span to fail said the state 
highway commissioner 
a tractortrailer rig and at least four other vehicles fell 25 
feet into the river 
a 1987 inspection found no abnormalities but the collapse 
probably will lead the state to review its procedures said bill 
moore a state transportation department inspector 
we certainly will look at other bridges after this failure 
well probably reevaluate our whole program of inspection on this 
type of bridge moore said sunday 
national transportation safety board investigators were to meet 
with state bridge inspectors today authorities said 
the collapse of the twolane northbound bridge occurred 
saturday night about 45 miles north of memphis a companion 
twolane southbound bridge was unaffected although it remained 
closed following the cavein the tennessee highway patrol said 
it was not known how many people were riding on the bridge when 
it crumbled authorities said 
some of the cars are chopped up so bad theyre not sure how 
many cars they are talking about said cecil whaley operations 
officer of the tennessee emergency management agency 
they dont have good eyewitness accounts to determine how many 
cars were on the bridge 
among the seven bodies recovered were those of a trucker and his 
wife who had been returning home with a tractortrailer they had 
just bought in memphis police said 
billy herron sr 49 of ripley was driving the 18wheeler and 
his wife betty was following in a pickup truck said henning 
police chief charles fain herrons parents who had eaten dinner 
with their son that night in covington apparently crossed the 
bridge just before it failed fain said 
also recovered were the bodies of mary annette davidson and her 
husband jimmy davidson of ripley 
the bodies of wilma bonds jr a 49yearold jehovahs witness 
minister his wife barbara 25 and their 4yearold daughter 
sophia of ripley were pulled out saturday night fain said 
he never went to town otherwise the only time we ever knew 
they were in town was coming or going to church they were real 
religious going to church every night fain said 
the hatchie was at 147 feet 27 feet over flood stage about 
where the accident occurred the national weather service said it 
was not raining when the bridge gave way but had been in previous 
days 
the river had been at flood stage at the bridge for most of the 
last three months whaley said 
the river is now about 300 feet wide and the pier that gave way 
stands in water even when the river is below flood stage whaley 
said 
the flooding may have eroded the foundation of a bridge pier 
said highway commissioner jimmy evans 
continuous overbank flooding will cause a scouring that 
actually took the vertical support of the pier out and the pier 
fell evans said 
thunderstorms that brought heavy rain and 50 mph winds hampered 
the search for bodies whaley said divers suspended their efforts 
until morning but workers continued to use a crane to lift parts 
of the roadway out of the water he said 
larry prater of covington said residents have been concerned for 
some time that the bridge was getting old prater said three of his 
relatives were in a pickup truck that drove over the bridge shortly 
before it collapsed 
i was telling my wife the other day saying that bridge with 
as much water as weve had is a dangerous thing he said 
aging highway bridges have collapsed in other states in recent 
years in april 1987 an upstate new york span collapsed killing 
10 people in 1983 part of the mianus bridge in connecticut 
collapsed killing three people

caribou once so abundant in the north 
maine woods that a city was named after them are being brought 
back to state wilderness areas where herds havent roamed for more 
than 80 years 
fourteen young caribou will be taken to an undisclosed area 
within the 200000acre baxter state park in northern maine under 
a 2yearold campaign to restore the animal to the state 
seven males and seven females born to a herd that originated in 
newfoundland will be tranquilized and trucked to the area on 
tuesday and wednesday 
the caribou will spend several weeks in a 3acre enclosure 
feasting on pellets they have lived on while in captivity then 
they will be released 
officials are keeping the location of the enclosure a secret 
fearing that people would disturb the herd 
essentially i think the caribou could be loved to death 
said biologist mark mccollough director of the privately funded 
maine caribou reintroduction project too many people out there 
could drive them away from the best habitat 
the reindeerlike animals were pushed to extinction in the state 
by overeager hunters disease and development the last maine 
caribou was seen in 1908 on the milehigh mount katahdin in what is 
now baxter park 
state officials have talked about bringing back the caribou 
since the 1920s an attempt was made in 1963 but the two dozen 
canadian caribou released in baxter park soon vanished a result of 
poaching and natural predators 
biologists and wildlife officials see the latest project as an 
experiment but are resolved to try a more sophisticated phasedin 
approach 
in december 1986 more than two dozen caribou destined to become 
the states nursery herd were captured in newfoundland and 
trucked 1200 miles to maine the animals to be released are the 
offspring of those caribou 
even after the 14 caribou are released 27 others will remain 
protected in an enclosure at the university of maine in orono 
where the oldest will continue producing calves for future 
releases up to 14 calves are expected to be born next month 
between 80 and 100 young caribou are expected to be released in 
maines wilds during the next four years said mccollough 
biologists plan to keep close tabs on the released caribou by 
attaching radio collars that send a signal when the animals die 
two other research projects at the university are investigating 
a potential threat to the caribou the brainworm parasite 
which also affects deer 
coordinators of the reintroduction project have hired a 
biologist to monitor and protect the caribou at the park until 
their final release this spring after that poaching remains a 
threat but the legislature has imposed maximum fines of 10000 
and three years in prison for illegally killing a caribou

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether a maryland mother may be jailed for refusing to reveal the 
whereabouts of her son who authorities fear may be dead 
the justices said they will hear arguments by prosecutors who 
say the need to protect abused children in such cases outweighs a 
parents constitutional right against selfincrimination 
the court also granted an appeal filed in behalf of the womans 
son 
the case dates back to jan 23 1987 when jacqueline 
bouknights threemonthold son maurice was admitted to a baltimore 
hospital with a broken leg and other partially healed fractures 
suspecting the infant had been abused baltimore social workers 
put maurice in foster care and later obtained a court order giving 
the city protective custody of him 
city officials also said ms bouknight suffered from emotional 
problems and had been observed throwing maurice into his crib 
during the infants hospitalization ms bouknight did not dispute 
the citys assertions 
maurice was returned to ms bouknights custody on july 17 
1987 after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo 
training in acquiring parenting skills 
but nine months later the social workers said ms bouknight no 
longer was cooperating with them they said maurices father 
recently had been shot to death and that ms bouknight was using 
drugs 
they also said they feared maurice might be dead 
ms bouknight was held in contempt by a judge on april 28 1988 
after she refused to disclose maurices whereabouts the day before 
she told the judge the boy was with her sister in texas but the 
sister said she had not seen maurice 
the judge ordered ms bouknight jailed until she revealed where 
her son is 
the maryland court of appeals by a 52 vote last dec 19 ruled 
that jailing ms bouknight for refusing to disclose information 
about her sons whereabouts violated her constitutional protection 
against selfincrimination 
the state court said in these circumstances if the 
information discloses that maurice is now dead or has been subject 
to criminal abuse as the prosecution candidly fears suspicion 
concededly would focus on bouknight as the criminal agent 
by disclosing the demanded information therefore bouknight 
would in the event a crime had been committed upon maurices 
person be incriminating herself 
chief justice william h rehnquist set aside the state court 
decision pending further review of the case by the full supreme 
court he thus reinstated the contempt citation and the indefinite 
jailing of ms bouknight 
in any event prosecutors said she was behind bars on 
independent grounds a theft conviction that resulted in an 
18month jail sentence 
advocates for children and youth in baltimore joined maryland 
officials in urging the justices to reverse the state courts 
ruling that ms bouknights constitutional rights were violated 
the childrens rights organization said the state court ruling 
could tie the hands of juvenile courts in protecting neglected and 
abused children 
the cases are baltimore department of social services vs 
bouknight 881182 and maurice m vs bouknight 886651

the supreme court today refused to throw out 
an indictment accusing new york city hotel owners harry and leona 
helmsley of federal income tax evasion 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that dismissed 
the helmsleys challenge to the 47count indictment 
todays action comes less than a week after the high court in 
an unrelated case limited the right of criminal defendants to 
challenge indictments before trial 
the justices on march 28 ruled that federal criminal defendants 
who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their indictments because 
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are 
tried and convicted 
the helmsleys appeal raised the same issue 
they were indicted with two hotel executives a year ago on 
charges they evaded some 12 million in federal taxes over a 
threeyear period 
the helmsleys said the indictment should be thrown out because 
of preindictment publicity generated by federal prosecutors 
on numerous occasions the helmsleys contended unnamed law 
enforcement officials were quoted in news articles making accusing 
and unflattering comments about the hotel owners 
for example one newspaper article that appeared two weeks 
before the indictment quoted an anonymous investigator as saying 
people were waiting in line to testify against mrs helmsley 
a federal judge who refused to throw out the indictment said 
there was no persuasive evidence that the grand jury was influenced 
by the news coverage 
the case is helmsley vs us 88732

the supreme court today refused to scuttle the 
irancontra trial of oliver north or block the trials of two of his 
codefendants 
the court without comment rejected arguments aimed at 
dismissing the case because of testimony the defendants gave to a 
congressional committee 
todays action comes less than a week after the high court 
limited the right of criminal defendants to challenge indictments 
before trial 
the justices on march 28 ruled that federal criminal defendants 
who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their indictments because 
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are 
tried and convicted 
in the irancontra case the us circuit court of appeals here 
rejected on sept 30 an attempt to stop the irancontra prosecution 
the appeals court said it was premature to consider arguments 
that the defendants congressional testimony had been used 
illegally to indict them the appeals court said it would study the 
issue only if there are convictions in the case 
north a former national security council aide is currently on 
trial separate trials are planned for his codefendants 
those defendants are former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim they are to be tried 
separately at a later date 
a fourth defendant in the irancontra prosecution retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord was not involved in the appeal 
acted on today 
us district judge gerhard a gesell on jan 13 dismissed major 
charges against north after independent counsel lawrence walsh and 
attorney general dick thornburgh said a trial on those charges 
could jeopardize national security 
the dismissed charges included allegations that north diverted 
more than 14 million from the sales of us arms to iran to the 
nicaraguan rebels or contras 
the remaining charges against north include that he concealed 
from congress and former attorney general edwin meese iii his 
efforts on behalf of the contras 
north poindexter and hakim said grand jurors and grand jury 
witnesses were exposed to the highly publicized congressional 
testimony the defendants had given under a limited grant of 
immunity from prosecution 
the defendants had been guaranteed that their congressional 
testimony would not be used against them in the criminal 
prosecution 
gesell has ruled that the issue of whether any socalled 
tainted congressional testimony was used to indict the 
defendants can be decided after any possible convictions in the 
case 
the appeals court here agreed 
the defendants said the only way to protect their rights was for 
the courts to decide before trial if tainted testimony contributed 
to their indictments 
the case is poindexter vs us 88888

two hungarian physicists replicated an 
experiment first done in utah to produce controlled nuclear fusion 
using basic chemistry the official mti news agency reported today 
gyula csikai and tibor sztaricskai from the experimental physics 
department of lajos kossuth university in debrecen eastern 
hungary succeeded in reproducing the experiment on thursday mti 
said 
they produced an electrolysis in heavy water water that 
includes an isotope of hydrogen between platinum and palladium 
electrodes and were able to register nuclear fusion by neutron 
counters the agency said 
fusion occurs when the nucleus or core of one hydrogen atom 
fuses with the nucleus of another hydrogen atom creating heat 
this result was reinforced by subsequent control tests the 
agency said 
the report on the experiment was confirmed today by istvan 
palfy rector of kossuth university 
b stanley pons chairman of the university of utahs chemistry 
department and martin fleischmann of southhampton university in 
england claimed the breakthrough in nuclear fusion march 24 they 
predicted the development could lead to a technology capable of 
driving electrical generators 
other nuclear scientists said the experiment would have to be 
duplicated independently before the findings of pons and 
fleischmann could be accepted 
nuclear fusion the power that fuels the sun is regarded as 
sciences next great frontier in developing new sources of energy 
but has generally been considered to be years away from commercial 
exploitation 
it differs from conventional processes in that it fuses atoms 
rather than splits them and generates little radioactive waste 
but standard fusion experiments have required extremely high 
temperatures for the reaction to occur 
mti said the departmentplans to conduct further experiments to 
trace the exact mechanism of the process taking place in palladium 
which may finally make the practical application of nuclear fusion 
possible

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether defense contractors violate a federal conflictofinterest 
law when paying severance to employees who quit to take important 
government jobs 
the court said it will hear appeals by the boeing co and five 
former employees who received 485000 in severance when they left 
to take jobs in the reagan administration 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last may ordered either 
boeing or the former employees to turn the severance payments over 
to the government 
the appeals court said boeing paid the money to the employees to 
compensate them for taking lowerpaying government jobs 
such payments create at least the appearance of a conflict of 
interest the appeals court said 
we hold that payments made to future federal employees before 
they begin government service can violate federal 
conflictofinterest law if they are made with compensatory 
intent the appeals court said 
government lawyers urged the supreme court to reject the appeals 
by boeing and the five former employees 
the government said the severance payments were classic 
violations of federal law because they were intended to 
encourage the recipients to accept the government positions and 
they were calculated to supplement the recipients federal salaries 
by making up the difference between their government pay and their 
higher pay with boeing 
the five are thomas k jones who received 132000 from boeing 
before he became deputy undersecretary of defense for strategic 
and theater nuclear forces in 1981 herbert a reynolds 80000 
deputy director of space and intelligence policy in 1981 melvin r 
paisley 183000 assistant secretary of the navy for research 
engineering and systems in 1981 lawrence h crandon 40000 a 
computer scientist for the nato air command and control systems in 
1982 and harold kitson 50000 deputy assistant secretary of the 
navy for command communications and control intelligence in 1982 
the former employees in the appeal acted on today said they 
were not responsible for pentagon contracting or procurement and 
said they had exemplary records with the government 
they argued there was no question of divided loyalties for any 
of them because each received an irrevocable severance payment 
before he entered into government service

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that city police officers may be required to undergo random drug 
tests and tests that are part of annual physical examinations 
the justices without comment turned away arguments in behalf 
of washington township nj police officers 
the high court last month handed down its first drugtesting 
decisions upholding drug and alcohol tests for railway workers 
involved in accidents and us customs service employees applying 
for drug enforcement jobs or those jobs that require carrying a 
firearm 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals dismissing claims the 
washington township tests violate privacy rights ruled last june 
that police officers are part of a highly regulated industry 
subject to such searches even if drug abuse is not suspected 
the appeals court noted that rules specify what police may wear 
how they may cut their hair and when they may smoke 
the 3rd circuit court previously approved random drug tests for 
jockeys because they are part of a highly regulated industry 
the police industry is probably the most highly regulated 
with respect to performance of its employees of any industry in 
new jersey the appeals court said 
it added that police officers exercise the most awesome and 
dangerous power that a democratic state possesses with respect to 
its residents the power to use lawful force to arrest and detain 
them 
in their decisions last week the justices did not decide the 
constitutionality of random drug tests for public employees 
washington township a small suburb of philadelphia adopted 
drug testing for municipal workers in november 1986 in response to 
a call from president reagan for a campaign to assure drugfree 
workplaces 
mayor john robertson said i firmly believe that as employees 
of the taxpayers we have an obligation to show the way toward 
achieving a drugfree workplace 
the policemens benevolent association with support from the 
american civil liberties union said the tests infringe on 
constitutional protections against unlawful searches and seizures 
a federal judge agreed ruling that tests are permissible only 
when there is an individualized reasonable suspicion an 
officer is using drugs 
but the 3rd circuit court reversed that ruling 
in appealing to the supreme court the police union said there 
have been no problems with drugs among municipal employees the 
tests are an improper response to public concern the union said 
heightened public attention to the law enforcement problems 
created by illegal drug trafficking has engendered powerful 
pressures to weaken the constitutional protections long afforded to 
all citizens the union said 
in another case the court without comment let stand the 
firing of james b copeland as a philadelphia police officer 
copeland tested positive for mariujuana or hashish after his

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that permits widespread drug testing of workers in the nuclear 
power industry 
the court without comment turned away an appeal by workers 
applying for jobs with a company that does maintenance work on a 
nuclear plant in washington state 
the justices last month handed down their first drugtesting 
decisions upholding drug and alcohol tests for railway workers 
involved in accidents and for us customs service employees 
applying for drug enforcement jobs or jobs that require carrying a 
firearm 
the washington supreme court last july upheld a mandatory 
urinetesting program for applicants at bechtel construction inc 
the company does repair and maintenance work during nuclear plant 
shutdowns for the washington public power supply system wppss 
a group of plumbers pipefitters and welders said the tests 
violate privacy safeguards in the state and federal constitutions 
the state court threw out the state constitutional claim on 
grounds it is preempted by federal law regulating nuclear power 
plants 
the state court also said that the tests do not violate the 
federal constitution because the nuclear industry is so heavily 
regulated and that those working in the industry have a reduced 
expectationof privacy 
the lingering effects of drug abuse can impair ones physical 
and mental capacity and such impairment can have catastrophic 
consequences in the setting of a nuclear power facility the 
state court said 
it added that testing applicants for such jobs is the only 
opportunity the employer will have to determine whether a 
prospective worker is using drugs unlike workers already on the 
job there is no opportunity to observe a job applicant the state 
court said 
wppss does not test those already employed unless there is 
reason to suspect a worker is using drugs 
routine drug testing in the context of preemployment 
screening is virtually the only way in which the operators of the 
wppss facility can effectively monitor compliance with rules 
against drug use the state court said 
it noted that those who test positive are not prosecuted for 
drug use and may reapply for employment six months later 
there is no permanent stain on an applicants record the 
state court said 
the case is alverado vs wppss 88645

portauprince haiti ap lt gen prosper avril went on 
national television early today to announce that forces loyal to 
his government thwarted a coup attempt by powerhungry soldiers 
there were indications the attempt to overthrow avril may have 
been related to his vow to crack down on officers involved in drug 
smuggling 
the international airport remained closed early today and 
soldiers patrolled portauprince streets now quiet that had 
echoed with gunfire 24 hours earlier 
avril who assumed power in a coup six months ago was 
reportedly seized at his suburban home early sunday and rescued by 
loyal soldiers as he was being driven to the airport to be deported 
some members of the armed forces blinded by their exorbitant 
ambitions attempted to overthrow the government avril said in a 
10minute speech on staterun television 
i appeal to the nation to cooperate with us in peace and unity 
for the realization of our democratic objectives he added 
avril gave no details of the attempted coup but said i have 
faith in the army there were no reports of casualties 
he was flanked by a dozen soldiers including sgt major joseph 
heubreux who led the september revolt by noncommissioned officers 
that put avril in power after ousting a regime blamed for 
widespread human rights abuses 
todays events have shown that the establishment of democracy 
in haiti under the present circumstances is a long and arduous 
task said avril who has promised presidential elections this 
year and other reforms 
loyalists in tanks thwarted sundays coup attempt by rescuing a 
handcuffed avril as he was being driven by rebel officers to the 
airport to be flown out of haiti according to presidential 
guardsmen and a us embassy official 
a government communique said that in the early hours of the coup 
attempt certain officers besieged the presidential palace and 
attempted to overthrow the government 
last week avril fired four senior army officers for alleged 
drug trafficking and promised the crackdown would bring more purges 
in the military 
richard melton us deputy assistant secretary of state for 
caribbean affairs had told avril that resumption of 70 million in 
us aid depended partly on efforts to curb the drug trade 
an army officer col jeanclaude paul was indicted by a miami 
grand jury on drug smuggling charges last year but died in october 
after eating soup that officials said was poisoned 
us officials began to talk of restoring the funds after the 
50yearold avril came to power sept 17 1988 in the coup that 
ousted lt gen henri namphy namphy had ruled the country for most 
of the 2 years after jeanclaude duvalier was deposed in a 1986 
popular uprising that ended three decades of duvalier family rule 
details on sundays events were sketchy and sometimes conflicted 
presidential guardsmen said avril was taken captive early sunday 
at his mansion in canape verte a wealthy neighborhood in the hills 
overlooking portauprince after he returned home from a party 
they said avrils wife marieange and her mother were taken 
captive with avril but released a few hours later 
loyal soldiers said one of avrils sons two of his brothers 
and interior minister col acedius st louis and his son were also 
seized by the rebels they were reportedly freed sunday night after 
loyalists in two tanks rolled into the leopards commando 
battalions encampment outside the capital 
us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde said reports indicated the 
coup attempt began at about 430 am sunday and that avril was 
detained for a time unconfirmed reports said four army officers 
planned the coup including gen guy francois commander of the 
powerful dessalines barracks the units fortress next to the 
national palace houses the most feared fighters in haitis 
7000man army 
the reports said the four officers were detained 
military sources confirmed that one officer identified as a 
leader lt col himmler rebu was under military guard at the 
national palace rebu commanded the leopards battalion 
the sources said coup leaders asked army commander maj gen 
herard abraham to assume the presidency and the plot collapsed when 
he refused 
although avril has promised elections this year and restored 
some suspended constitutional rights two weeks ago critics say he 
is moving too slowly toward democratic reforms 
the only way for haiti to stop having coups is for it to have 
a legitimate constitutionally elected civilian government said 
louis dejoie jr a moderate politician with presidential 
aspirations

the supreme court today turned away a dispute 
over the confidentiality of lawyers documents in a case stemming 
from a defense contractors fraudulent travel reimbursement scheme 
the court without comment refused to hear appeals by martin 
marietta corp and a former employee who said the company is trying 
to make him the scapegoat for the scheme 
martin marietta based in bethesda md pleaded guilty in 1987 
to mail fraud and furnishing the government with a false statement 
the company was fined 12000 and ordered to repay 250000 the 
government spent investigating the case 
martin marietta also paid the government more than 43 million 
in a separate noncriminal settlement with the pentagons 
procurement arm the defense logistics agency 
federal investigators said a martin marietta subsidiary and a 
travel agency it hired billed the government for the full price of 
air fare when martin marietta employees traveled in connection with 
pentagon contracts 
the investigators said the employees actually used discount 
fares and received rebates that martin marietta kept for itself 
while under investigation martin mariettas lawyers turned over 
various documents to federal prosecutors in an attempt to persuade 
the government not to seek an indictment 
the case acted on today involves an effort by indicted former 
martin marietta employee william pollard to obtain those records 
pollard headed a subsidiary the company set up to handle travel 
arrangements for its workers 
he was indicted on april 7 1987 by a federal grand jury in 
baltimore on fraud charges 
pollard said he sought the records of the company lawyers to 
help him prove that martin marietta is trying to make him the 
scapegoat for the travelrebate scheme 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last september ruled 
partly in his favor and partly for the company 
the appeals court ordered martin marietta to turn over a 
substantial portion of the documents including internal audits and 
lawyers memos the appeals court said the usual secrecy protection 
for exchanges between lawyers and clients was surrendered when the 
martin marietta attorneys agreed to provide the documents to 
federal prosecutors 
but the appeals court said pollard is not entitled to see 
material in those memos and related documents in which lawyers 
discuss theories of the case or give their impressions of such 
matters as the credibility of witnesses 
what should not be ordered to be disclosed to pollard are 
pure expressions of legal theory or metal impressions the 
appeals court said 
martin marietta asked the supreme court to bar pollard from 
seeing any of the lawyers memos 
the company was supported by the american bar association which 
said the 4th circuit court ruling compromises lawyerclient 
confidentiality and jeopardizes efforts by suspects lawyers to 
cooperate with the government 
pollard in a separate appeal asked the high court to let him 
see the uncensored versions of the memos including the opinions 
and impressions of the attorneys 
the cases are martin marietta vs pollard 881157 and pollard 
vs martin marietta 881338

the supreme court today ruled that a texas 
school boards policy does not violate the voting rights of 
hispanics 
the court by a 72 vote upheld a policy limiting the power of 
a single board member to place an item on the agenda for board 
meetings 
justices byron r white and antonin scalia dissented saying the 
court should hear oral arguments in the case before deciding it 
the school board in victoria texas has seven members since 
1984 five board members have been elected from singlemember 
districts and two in atlarge voting 
theresa gutierrez became the first and only mexicanamerican 
elected to the school board in 1985 she represents a district with 
a 514 percent hispanic population and a 14 percent black 
population 
the school board in 1987 changed its policy for placing items on 
meeting agendas the new policy says the school board president may 
require the approval of two board members also called trustees 
before an item can be added to the agenda for an upcoming meeting 
mrs gutierrez and others in her district said the new policy 
affects the rights of voters she represents by reducing her power 
to recommend agenda items 
she said the federal voting rights act requires that the us 
attorney general approve the policy before it can be implemented 
but a threejudge federal court last year ruled against ms 
gutierrez and her constitutents 
the federal court said the new policys effect on the powers 
of the elected trustees was at most minuscule 
the threejudge court compared the policy to the standard 
parliamentary procedure that requires someone to second any motion 
or resolution before it can be submitted to a vote 
it seems plain to us that if mrs gutierrez is unable to 
persuade even one other trustee to join her in placing a matter on 
the boards agenda she would have no better succeess in procuring 
a second should she have moved it at a meeting the federal court 
said 
also the federal court said the policy in no way singles her 
out for unfavorable procedural treatment 
the case is rojas vs victoria independent school district

1287 million judgment penthouse won against a virginia savings 
and loan company and a washington law firm 
the court also rejected a related appeal by the savings and loan

dominion federal retained the washington law firm of melrod redman 
amp gartlan to represent it in the negotiations

and penthouse then filed a federal suit in new york city accusing 
the lending institution and the law firm of illegally breaking a 
contract 
a federal judge ruled for penthouse awarding it 1287 million 
in anticipated lost profits from the casino the judge also ordered 
dominion federal to pay another 77 million to queen city savings 
amp loan association which tried to arrange the casino financing

court of appeals 
the appeals court said dominion federal and its law firm did not 
act illegally in backing out of the deal 
the appeals court also threw out a counterclaim by dominion 
federal against queen city 
in the appeal acted on today penthouse lawyers said the appeals 
court ruling fashions a rule of law for commercial transactions 
completely at odds with the law of the state of new jersey which 
the court had a duty to apply in this case

foundations fee fortas resigned under the threat of impeachment

series of annual 20000 payments for the rest of his life and

the supreme court today ordered 
reconsideration of a ruling that allows district of columbia 
officials to require drug testing for employees involved in the 
busing of handicapped students 
the justices said a federal appeals court should reexamine the 
case in light of their rulings last month on mandatory drug tests 
the justices on march 21 announced their first drugtesting 
decisions upholding drug and alcohol tests for railway workers 
involved in accidents and us customs service employees applying 
for drug enforcement jobs or those jobs that require carrying a 
firearm 
the district of columbia case stems from the firing and later 
reinstatement of juanita m jones an attendant on a bus used to 
transport handicapped students between their homes and schools 
ms jones was fired after testing positive for marijuana and 
was ordered reinstated by a federal judge who said she could not be 
fired on the basis of the drug test conducted by the city because 
of its questionable reliability in determining onthejob drug use 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled in 1987 that the 
city government generally may require workers in such jobs to 
undergo routine testing for drugs because they are responsibile for 
the safety of schoolchildren 
but the appeals court ruling did not alter the judges decision 
reinstating ms jones that sparked a supreme court appeal by 
school district officials 
justice john paul stevens dissented from the high courts order 
today he said the school districts appeal should be turned down 
the case is mckenzie vs jones 871706

the former head of the marine corps testified 
today that he reluctantly extended oliver norths tour at the 
national security council after high administration officials 
persuaded him that norths work was too important for him to leave 
former marine corps commander paul x kelley testified at 
norths trial that in spring 1984 there were a number of people 
who intervened in the north matter including cia director william 
casey and united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick they urged 
that north be permitted to remain at the nsc 
also today the supreme court refused to scuttle norths 
irancontra trial or block the trials of two of his codefendants 
the court without comment rejected arguments aimed at 
dismissing the case because of testimony the defendants gave to a 
congressional committee 
contacts with casey and kirkpatrick followed a plea from robert 
mcfarlane then national security council adviser that north was 
engaged in extremely important work and should stay on said 
kelley 
the former marine commandant said he was concerned that a delay 
in returning to the corps would hurt norths military career but 
he acquisced to the request 
while kelley was on the witness stand prosecutor john keker 
presented a series of messages between north and mcfarlane showing 
that north did not want to return to the marine corps base at camp 
lejeune to command a battalion 
a major private contributor to the contra cause mrs ellen 
garwood testified that north never asked her for money and that at 
no time did she make out a check in his presence she said that a 
75000 check she wrote to a fundraising organization was drafted 
after she left a briefing by north in his office 
he said this is a desperate situation for the freedom 
fighters im not asking you for money as a member of the 
government and the national security council i cannot ask for 
money said mrs garwood an austin texas heiress who has said 
previously that her contributions to the contra cause totaled 22 
million 
on sept 12 1985 mrs garwood said she wrote out a check for 
32000 after a briefing from north at a dallas airport 
while colonel north was present did fund raiser carl 
channell ask you for money that night asked defense counsel 
brendan sullivan 
no he never did that she said colonel north wouldnt 
have allowed it 
kelley became the first witness for the defense following a 
sixweek presentation by the prosecution which formally concluded 
its case today 
kelley said that in february 1985 mcfarlane asked in a breakfast 
meeting mcfarlane had requested that norths nsc tour be extended 
again 
i was not favorably disposed to grant the extension but 
again did so said kelley 
by february 1985 north was deeply involved in a secret effort 
to ship arms to the contras congress had banned military aid to 
the nicaraguan rebels as of october 1984 
a third request to extend norths tour came in the spring of 
1986 and was granted through the normal channels said kelley 
north had sought to call president reagan as his first witness 
but the judge in the case said friday there was not any evidence to 
bolster a claim that reagan had authorized north to commit illegal 
activities 
north lawyer barry simon jumped friday on the prosecutions weak 
points citing uncertainty by mcfarlane about whether north wrote a 
key draft of a letter to congress 
the september 1985 letter to thenus rep michael barnes 
denied north was assisting the contras and resulted in a charge 
against him of making false statements to congress 
us district judge gerhard a gesell reserved the right to set 
aside a verdict on another charge on grounds the alleged crime 
might not have been committed in washington dc but rather in 
adjacent virginia 
the charge accuses north of accepting a security system free of 
charge from codefendant richard secord whom north had enlisted to 
run arms to the contras 
proving the charge is complicated by the testimony of former cia 
employee glenn robinette who testified he sent backdated bills to 
north demanding payment for the security system without being 
asked robinette said he engaged in a coverup after getting a 
phone call from north pointing out that he hadnt sent him a bill 
robinette had been paid months before by secord and north didnt 
contact robinette about the matter until a week or so after being 
fired from his national security council staff job in the 
irancontra affair the attorney general had announced when north 
was fired that a criminal investigation would be conducted 
at fridays hearing the judge mused whether robinette was on 
a frolic of his own or cia bias or what when he launched a 
coverup without being specifically asked to do so 
gesell dashed norths hopes that he could call reagan as a 
witness in an attempt to bolster the defenses central contention 
that if north told lies he was authorized to do so

lt col robert earl rebuffed by the senate 
for promotion last year because of questions about his role in the 
irancontra affair failed this year to win nomination for 
advancement from the marine corps officials said monday 
earl 43 served as the deputy to lt col oliver north on the 
staff of the national security council from february 1986 to 
january 1987 north is on trial in us district court here 
accused of concealing from congress and former attorney general 
edwin meese iii his efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan contra 
guerillas 
earl now a plans officer at the marine corps combat development 
command in quantico va has acknowledged that he was aware of the 
diversion of profits from arms sales to iran to support the 
contras and said that he aided north in the destruction of records 
after the affair became public 
last fall a marine corps promotion board selected earl for 
advancement to the rank of colonel the senate armed services 
committee however took the unusual step of refusing the promotion 
while allowing others on the marine list to go forward 
at the time sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the panel 
said he was troubled that the corps apparently had not considered 
earls activities at the white house when it reviewed his military 
record 
monday maj ron stokes a spokesman for the corps said that a 
list of 130 marine lieutenant colonels selected for advancement to 
colonel had been sent to the senate two weeks ago and that earls 
name was not on the list 
the spokesman said navy secretary william l ball iii had 
ordered a special threemember board of generals to study the 
matter after the senate panels rebuff last year the generals 
later submitted a report recommending that certain irancontra 
activities by earl be included in his military personnel records 
the spokesman continued 
secretary ball approved and lt col earl then had an 
opportunity to review the report and respond in writing to the 
recommendations which he did said stokes 
then the whole package was sent to the selection board but he 
wasnt selected by this board thats true 
earl testified last week at norths trial under a grant of 
immunity which he received in exchange for the testimony he had 
given congress earl said through a spokesman that he would not 
comment on the promotion boards decision 
earl a graduate of the us naval academy is a 22year marine 
corps veteran he is not required to retire and remains eligible 
for promotion each year his rejection by the board this year 
however reduces his chances for next year 
besides earl the senate last year also rebuffed the selection 
of army col james steele to become a brigadier general steele is 
the former head of the us military assistance group in el 
salvador and played a role in the secret contra resupply operation 
the army has not decided whether to again recommend steele for 
promotion lt col greg rixon a spokesman said monday

a group identifying itself as the animal 
liberation front claimed responsibility for two earlymorning arson 
fires that caused an estimated 100000 damage and may have 
unleashed a potentially deadly disease 
the group claimed in a letter sent to news organizations that it 
freed more than 1000 animals from three research facilities at the 
university of arizona and set fire to a diagnostic lab and a 
converted house near the medical college campus 
charles sterling a professor of veterinary science said 30 
young mice infected with what he described as a third world disease 
were among those taken 
the mice carry the disease cryptosporidium which sterling said 
cause severe diarrhea lasting two to four weeks he says the mice 
will overcome the disease in a week to 10 days but they and their 
fecal matter are infectious until then 
sterling said the disease has been known to be fatal to aids 
patients other immunosuppressed individuals and malnurished 
children and he said there is no known treatment for it 
fire capt keith richter said no one was injured in the fires 
one on the main campus and one near the medical campus two 
laboratories were gutted and two others partially damaged and 
classrooms were damaged in the first fire he said

it also claimed that arguments that animal research benefits 
human health are blatant lies spread by the research industry to 
protect itself from the truth animal research never has and never 
will benefit human health because of radically different 
physiological makeup from that of humans it said 
concrete and steel doors will not stop us the statement 
said we will be back and will keep coming back until all animal 
torture at u of a is stopped

a lack of snow didnt stop vermont from a 
good ski season its third best because resorts were able to rely 
heavily on fake stuff 
the vermont ski areas association estimates skier day visits at 
42 million down from 485 million last season 
the best season on record was 198687 when 52 million skier 
days were recorded 
business was good at some of the smaller resorts which spent 
considerable money on snowmaking and advertising before the season 
began okemo mountain which advertises heavily in the new york 
area said business was up 35 percent 
resorts in the north also seemed to fare well thanks to heavier 
snowfall jay peak reported a 16 percent increase in business and 
burke mountain an 8 percent increase the vsaa said 
but killington was down 4 percent and mount snow also reported a 
drop in skier visits said candace moot vsaa associate director 
killington is a large percentage of the market and mount 
snow too they brought the statewide average down she said 
business was also down at smaller familyowned operations like 
cochran ski area in richmond 
people didnt think skiing said coowner virginia cochran 
whose area has 30 percent snowmaking i also think it was a nice 
winter to be outdoors kids could ride their bikes all winter or 
play basketball in the driveway or they could go hiking 
many of the resorts will likely close this month ascutney 
mountain burke suicide six maple valley haystack and the 
middlebury college snow bowl have already closed while bromley and

an expanded acreage of fluecured and burley 
tobacco could boost 1989 production significantly but reduced 
carryin stocks would mean a smaller total tobacco supply the 
agriculture department said monday 
overall tobacco acreage may be up about 13 percent this year to 
about 713000 acres which chiefly reflects an 11 percent increase 
in the effective quota for fluecured and a 20 percent increase for 
burley the departments economic research service said in a 
preliminary report 
if growers of fluecured carry out their intention acreage 
would rise to 403000 acres 10 percent above last year and 31 
percent above 1986s record low of 308000 acres the report said 
average yields would mean about a 15 percent boost in 1989 
tobacco output from last years 135 billion pounds however the 
report added smaller carryin stocks would reduce the domestic 
tobacco supply for 198990 from the current seasons level 
cigarette production last year rose about 1 percent to 695 
billion pieces the report said domestic use declined by about 
2 percent as forecast previously but exports rose significantly 
the use of cigarettes by adult americans 18 and older declined 3 
percent last year to an average of 3096 cigarettes the report 
said the annual average by adults peaked at 4345 cigarettes per 
person in 1963 but generally has declined since then 
domestic cigarette consumption will probably continue to fall 
this year because of higher prices antismoking activity and 
increased restrictions on where people may smoke the report 
said cigarette exports on the other hand are expected to rise 
again this year

an index measuring the ability of the typical 
american family to buy a home made its sharpest drop in 15 years 
last month as rising mortgage rates and home prices resulted in a 
loss of purchasing power a real estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said its affordability 
index was at 105 in february down 51 index points from a revised 
1101 in january it was the biggest monthtomonth decline since 
the measure dropped 52 index points from 137 to 1318 in january 
1974 
februarys index level meant that a family earning the median 
income of 32314 annually had 5 percent more income than needed to 
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of 
a medianpriced home 
the median price for an existing home in february was 93100 
meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less februarys 
median price was up 3400 from january 
the mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 977 
percent in february from 961 percent representing a composite of 
fixed and adjustable rates 
john a tuccillo chief economist for the realtors said the 
index was likely to decline again in march since mortgage rates 
continued to increase although prices and rates should level off 
later this spring 
the affordability index has been above 100 since it hit 998 in 
may 1986 
for nearly three years housing affordability for the typical 
buyer has been well above the breakeven point said ira gribin 
president of the realtors group but hikes in mortgage rates and 
prices have made buying more difficult

salvage crews on monday towed a 
badly damaged oil tanker into port after it ran aground in the 
rhine river and officials said any danger of a major oil spill was 
over 
workers pumped about 42000 gallons of fuel oil out of the 
vessel rhinetank 24 and towed it to oppenheim harbor where the 
rest of the load was being pumped out said the hesse state water 
protection police 
the ship was originally carrying about 300000 gallons of fuel 
oil 
officials had been worried the vessel could break apart because 
of the strong rhine currents and spill its cargo into the river 
but the police said that danger had passed now that the ship was in 
the protected harbor 
the vessel ran aground on an underwater stone wall near the city 
of oppenheim about 25 miles southwest of frankfurt early monday 
according to the water protection police 
the ship later dislodged from the wall but was badly damaged 
small amounts of fuel oil spilled into the rhine and shipping 
was backed up for several hours as crews pumped oil out of the 
crippled 300foot tanker in preparation for towing it to port 
water protection authorities surrounded the stricken vessel with 
oil containment booms and transferred some of the oil from the 
damaged tanker to another ship said jochen boehm a spokesman for 
the water protection office in mainz 
he said one of the ships 12 oil storage containers was damaged 
and initially leaked small amounts of the ships cargo but that 
the oil was quickly cleaned up by salvage crews 
boehm said he did not know the size of the leak or whether there 
had been any environmental damage 
more than 100 ships had to wait for several hours as workers 
pumped oil out of the crippled tanker the shipping lane at 
oppenheim was reopened in late afternoon

soviet chess prodigy gata kamsky said monday 
that he and his father defected to the united states because soviet 
chess officials had blocked his career for the last three years 
i decided to leave the soviet union because i cant play in 
chess tournaments so i cant grow in chess here i can play in all 
the tournaments every year the 14yearold kamsky speaking in 
english said at a crowded news conference at the marshall chess 
club in greenwich village 
his father rustam kamsky reading from a statement in faltering 
english said now we get the freedom my son can play in 
different cities in all the world please help my wife 
rustam said his wife bella who is gatas stepmother and 
remains in leningrad knew in advance of their decision to request 
asylum in the united states when they came here for a chess 
tournament three weeks ago 
yes they discussed it all together as a family and they 
jointly came to this decision that they would stay here said lev 
albert a grandmaster who defected from the soviet union in 1979 
and translated for the kamskys 
rustam kamsky said discrimination against the family because 
they were ethnic crimean tatars also had some bearing on their 
decision 
tatars dont have their homeland moscow is like an 
occupying power he said organizers in the other republics are 
able to support their players but because there is no such thing 
for the tatars they are in an underprivileged position compared 
with other chess players 
as they fielded questions the defectors fiddled with a 
miniature of the statue of liberty which stood on a table in front 
of gata asked if he knew what it was gata replied its the 
statue of liberty the symbol of america the symbol of freedom 
using a term first employed by world champion garri kasparov for 
the soviet chess establishment gata said in soviet union i 
cant do anything with the mafia the elder kamsky said soviet 
officials had limited his sons opportunities to play garri 
kasparov was trying to fight against this group which controls 
soviet chess but even kasparov is often unsuccessful he said 
kamsky said their position was far weaker than kasparovs and in 
the end they decided we couldnt do anything here 
last tuesday the young kamsky who experts predict will reach 
the highest echelons of world chess and his father asked for 
political asylum in the united states before the last round of the 
new york open tournament 
kamsky won his final round game and was spirited away to an 
undisclosed address in princeton nj where the kamskys have been 
staying with james sherwin the president of the american chess 
foundation 
later this week they are expected to move into their own 
apartment probably in the russianspeaking neighborhood of 
brighton beach in brooklyn

unmarked graves that may contain 
victims of political repression by the deposed regime of gen 
alfredo stroessner will be investigated the attorney general said 
monday 
in a separate development provisional president andres 
rodriguez extended voter registration by another 10 days for the 
may 1 elections and said indelible ink would be used on voters 
hands to prevent multiple voting both were concessions to 
opposition demands 
on saturday human rights activist francisco de vargas excavated 
what he said may be one of 30 graves on a river bank near colonia 
esperanza 90 miles east of asuncion he said residents told him 
they saw police execute victims near the grave site 
the grave contained shards of bone false teeth and a skull with 
possibly a bullet hole through it he said 
we view this finding with concern and will put all our effort 
into gathering enough information to begin a formal 
investigation said attorney general diogenes martinez 
three asuncion police officers accused of torturing prisoners 
during the stroessner regime have been suspended from duty 
rodriguez also the army commander pledged to respect human 
rights and uphold civil liberties shortly after he toppled 
stroessner in a feb 3 coup 
rodriguez this weekend formally accepted the nomination as 
ruling colorado party candidate in the may presidential elections 
he is widely expected to win 
on monday he said he extended voter registration so that the 
largest amount of people possible can vote in upcoming elections 
and that they will be considered clean 
indelible ink will be used during balloting so there really 
will be no possibility of fraud and each person can deposit only 
one vote he said 
both measures were requested by opposition political parties 
they also demanded rodriguez support a constitutional reform and 
agree not to seek reelection in 1993 if he wins may 1 rodriguez 
endorsed the latter two requests on sunday

government workers have been busy answering 
questions or listening to complaints on a controversial new tax 
reform that features a 3 percent sales levy an official said 
monday 
the fair trade commission has received more than 300 phone calls 
from tokyo residents about the reform which was implemented 
saturday said commission spokesman eiichiro kokubo 
most callers to the cartel emergency line pointed out 
unwarranted price markups and expressed fears of inflation he 
said 
japans first tax reform since world war ii covers everything 
from taxi rides to apartment rents it offsets cuts in corporate 
inheritance higherlevel income and residential taxes by 446 
billion in fiscal 1989 with the sales tax designed to gather 24 
billion in this first year 
under the reform the government adjusted a variety of taxes 
unevenenly befuddling consumers 
for example the price of expensive imported liquor fell while 
milk prices rose and the price of soft drinks sold in vending 
machines stayed the same television sets were cheaper but 
newspapers raised their prices 
the government granted a special exemption for small businesses 
who were not required to collect the 3 percent sales tax on goods 
and services small business and agriculture are the political 
mainstay of the government led by prime minister noboru takeshita 
but many exempt enterprises such as taxis and discount stores 
raised prices anyway some to offset increased operating costs 
others simply for profit 
the commissions telephone advisory service will continue for 
two years as the government looks for abuses in the new system 
kokubo said 
the economic planning agency has also received about 760 phone 
calls and consumer unions nationwide about 400 queries since 
saturday agency spokeswoman mitsuko asada said 
the tax reform and a stockprofiteering scandal involving 
takeshita and many party members have led to support ratings as low 
as 9 percent in recent opinion polls

a cornell university commission reported 
monday that a graduate student acted alone and with reckless 
disregard when he unleashed a computer worm that clogged 
thousands of computers around the country 
but a university official said that raising ethical awareness 
not security barriers is the best way to stop such problems 
the commission concluded in its report that robert t morris jr 
did not intend for the worm launched into the internet network last 
nov 2 to destroy data or files but that he did want it to spread 
widely 
the commission said the program was not technically a virus 
a program that inserts itself into a host program to propagate 
but was a worm an independent program that replicates itself 
once placed in a computer system 
contrary to morris claim release of the worm was not a 
heroic event that pointed up the weaknesses of operating 
systems the commission wrote the commission also denied that 
morris was a genius for creating the worm saying although it was 
technically sophisticated it could have been created by many 
students 
in fact morris juvenile act did little in the way of 
providing new insights into the already wellknown security flaws 
of the internet system a national research network used by 
universities industry and the government said m stuart lynn 
cornells vice president of technologies 
lynn and cornell provost robert barker said the incidents 
greatest impact was the breach of trust it caused among researchers 
who use the network however both cautioned that employing drastic 
security steps was not a solution to prevent similar incidents from 
happening in the future 
violations of such a trust cannot be condoned said lynn 
a community of scholars shouldnt have to build skyhigh walls in 
order to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy particularly 
when such walls would impede the free flow of information and 
ideas 
although security has been improved lynn said its unlikely any 
steps could guarantee an impenetrable system in a community of 
individuals possessed of all the knowledge and skills required to 
scale the highest barriers 
instead the cornell officials stressed the need for improved 
awareness of computer ethics 
the focus of our report is on heightening the ethical 
considerations rather than the security considerations said 
lynn 
cornell has an express policy about computer abuse which morris 
had been given a copy of said barker 
morris who is on a leave of absence from the schools doctoral 
program in computer science declined to be interviewed by the 
commission 
the commission made no recommendation about disciplinary action 
barker said morris case would be reviewed by a panel of graduate 
students and faculty members which could bar him permanently from 
the university barker said the punishment would not be made public 
morris 23 of arnold md remains under investigation by a 
federal grand jury in syracuse and the us justice department

thousands of apartment owners blocked 
streets in a lowerclass neighborhood of the capital monday to 
protest austerity policies that led to soaring mortgage interest 
rates 
the protesters in the baruta district shouted against the plan 
aimed at fighting inflation that ran 35 percent last year in an 
oilproducing country hit hard by lower prices on crude 
office workers who live in the district said morning bus traffic 
was halted and many people were forced to walk to get to work 
protests prompted by the the economic measures left at least 270 
people dead last month according to government figures although 
unofficial estimates place the toll between 300 and 500 
the new interest rate policy allows banks to float rates on 
loans and on deposits according to market pressures government 
economists have indicated the freefloating interest rates are 
necessary to prevent capital flight and promote savings 
but critics of the policy charge that the new interest rates 
which have gone from 13 percent on an average mortgage contract to 
28 percent as of last month with promises of higher rates to come 
will force thousands out of their homes 
neighborhood associations and political figures have filed a 
lawsuit in the venezuelan supreme court contesting the interest 
rate policy neighborhood groups have threatened to withhold their 
payments until the court decides the case 
news reports have indicated president carlos andres perez may be 
forced to adjust the program by creating additional subsidies for 
homeowners or placing a ceiling on interest rates 
the interest rate changes are part of an austerity plan begun to 
comply with international monetary fund plans for a realignment of 
venezuelas economy

a judge gave a photographer a suspended prison 
term of four months monday for entering a palestinian refugee camp 
classified as a closed military area 
in the occupied territories soldiers shot and killed a 
20yearold palestinian during a riot at the amari refugee camp in 
the west bank 
officials at ramallah hospital said mohammed ismail baba sufferd 
a gunshot wound in the chest and was dead on arrival at the 
hospital the army confirmed the death and said it was 
investigating 
arab hospital sources said at least eight palestinians were 
wounded by troops in scattered clashes in the gaza strip nusseirat 
refugee camp and in the west bank towns of hebron elbireh and 
ramallah the military confirmed one palestinian was wounded and 
said it was checking further 
at least 419 palestinians and 18 israelis have been killed in 
the 16monthold uprising against israeli occupation 
a childrens advocacy group said a 10yearold gaza strip boy 
detained for throwing stones was held for two weeks in march 
although israels age of criminal responsibility is 12 eitan haber 
of the defense ministry said he was checking the report 
judge edna bekenstein of the district court in netanya gave 
claudio nutkiewicz the suspended sentence and fined him 1000 
shekels about 555 for entering the balata camp in west bank in 
december 1987 the photographer said 
he said the judge told him he violated a 1970 law that 
designates all refugee camps as closed military areas he and other 
journalists said the decision could hamper coverage of the occupied 
territories where a palestinian uprising began 16 months ago 
an army spokesman said paragraph 90a of the 1970 law allows the 
military to declare any refugee camp closed if the authorities deem 
it necessary for operational reasons but it is certainly not 
automatic 
since the uprising began dec 8 1987 journalists have entered 
refugee camps freely unless the camps were under curfew or specific 
closure orders 
army officers are allowed to declare areas closed and ban news 
coverage during times of violent unrest the army requires officers 
who do so to show journalists a paper defining the closed areas 
robert slater chairman of the foreign press association said 
he was not aware of the law nutkiewicz said the judge cited 
i hope this will not affect press coverage he said noting 
that nutkiewicz was the first journalist covering the uprising to 
be convicted of violations connected with his work 
the argentineborn israeli who works for the images photo 
agency said he and other journalists entered balata to cover a 
womens demonstration and no one told him it was a closed area he 
was detained briefly that day 
in another press development monday israeli journalists said 
they would boycott activities of jewish settlers in the west bank 
until the settlers stop placing fake press signs in their car 
windows 
reporters said the phony signs make press identification useless 
as a protection from arab protesters who usually let journalists 
pass unharmed 
today they impersonate the press tomorrow theyll pose as 
ambulance drivers said roni shaked of the israeli journalists 
union who reports for the newspaper yediot ahronot 
the settlers think the signs will help but the result will 
be that the arabs will stone both of us and in the end democracy 
will suffer shaked said on israel radio 
yitzhak kadman director of the independent national council for 
the child said he sent a letter to defense minister yitzhak rabin 
protesting detention of the 10yearold palestinian he said the 
parents were not told their son was in army custody in gaza 
an army spokesman said the child was detained for throwing 
stones and told soldiers he was 12 kadman said the boy told the 
troopers repeatedly he was 10 
according to kadman the child was walking to his uncles home 
in the rafah refugee camp when soldiers in pursuit of 
stonethrowing youths grabbed him the boy was held in gaza 
detention centers for two weeks and was released march 9 he said 
even if he was over 12 it is inconceivable that they did not 
let the parents know their son was being held kadman said

syrian and christian gunners shelled 
residential areas of the divided city monday and politicians 
failed once again to stop the most violent chapter in lebanons 
long civil war since 1985 
a police spokesman said 20 people were killed and 42 wounded 
since the nonstop bombardment of the city and surrounding hills 
began at dusk saturday 
that brought the casualty toll to 147 killed and 481 wounded 
nearly all civilians since the battle began march 8 between the 
christian army units of gen michel aoun and druse militiamen 
backed by syrian troops 
a lull at midday monday allowed people to leave underground 
shelters for the first time in 40 hours they replenished stocks of 
food powdered milk water and tranquilizers then rushed back to 
bunkers 
this is driving me crazy said paula trad a christian 
university student who lives in east beiruts sin elfil district 
how long can people take it 
sources at aouns headquarters said his ustrained 8th brigade 
in souk elgharb repulsed syrian tank assaults on the deserted 
mountain resort with armorpiercing rockets 
it was the syrians first tank assault to test the 8th 
a source said privately they seem to be preparing for allout 
onslaught 
souk elgharb 15 miles southeast of beirut overlooks roads 
leading from the drusecontrolled chouf mountains to christian 
territory 
in washington the state department accused both sides of 
reckless disregard for human life and called for an immediate 
ceasefire 
a lebanese militia chieftain who has stayed out of the fight 
said leaders of 20 moslem and leftist militias would meet wednesday 
with an arab league committee about how to end the confrontation 
nabih berri of the shiite moslem militia amal made the announcement 
in the syrian capital 
chances of an immediate settlement collapsed monday when aoun 
who also heads a christian military cabinet rejected a suggestion 
by premier salem hoss leader of the competing moslem government 
that both resign 
an aide speaking anonymously by telephone quoted aoun as 
saying that wouldnt work its nonsense 
hoss made the suggestion sunday in a plea for the factions to 
stop shooting at once stop the bloodbath stop the massacre 
if gen aoun and myself have become the two sides of the coin 
in the current crisis then we had better rid our country and 
people of this problem he said in a broadcast on moslem radio 
stations 
abdulla rassi interior minister in the hoss cabinet told 
reporters monday were at a loss we cant find a way out of 
this horrific vicious circle 
he proposed a joint christian and moslem military committee of 
the fractured lebanese army to pursue ways of securing and 
monitoring a ceasefire 
aoun insists any such committee include the syrian army and have 
a mandate to enforce a truce and set a timetable for syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon 
a political crisis that began in september led to the two 
governments and division of the army on sectarian lines aoun leads 
the 20000 christian troopers and the 22000 moslems poorly 
equipped are commanded by maj gen sami khatib 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league granted in 1976 a year after the 
civil war began and has become the countrys main power broker 
aoun has declared a war of liberation to drive the syrians out 
fighting began two days after aouns forces imposed an airsea 
blockade march 6 on illegal ports run by militias which cost the 
governments five legal ports on the 130mile coast an estimated 
100 million a year in revenue 
walid jumblatts druse militia responded with artillery fire 
soon joined by syrian gunners and the syrians and khatibs moslem 
army troops blockaded the 310squaremile christian enclave north 
and east of beirut 
aouns blockade continues covering four ports run by moslem

the eighth victim of an apparent 
serial killer was identified monday as a 27yearold new bedford 
woman and authorities said a previously anonymous letter writer is 
aiding investigators 
the body found friday along route 88 in westport was identified 
as that of mary rose santos a mother of two young boys who had 
been missing since july 16 
meanwhile investigators aided by dogs trained to sniff out the 
dead resumed their search monday for more bodies along highways in 
southern massachusetts the dogs are trained with an aromatic 
compound called cadavarine 
like the previous seven victims santos had ties to this port 
citys drug community said bristol county district attorney ronald 
a pina 
an anonymous letter reached pina on march 16 telling him that 
investigators might find a body along route 88 if a body was 
found the author said he might come forward 
after two boys found santos body the informant contacted 
authorities 
he witnessed an event taking place along route 88 said jim 
martin a spokesman for pina this person is providing us with 
some good information and we need to protect this person 
martin added that he did not wish to say whether the informant 
was male or female 
investigators have met with the informant in secret and at 
various locations to maintain the informants anonymity martin 
said 
a special grand jury was to reconvene tuesday to hear testimony 
from 18 subpoenaed witnesses but martin said that the informant 
would not be among them because the news media will be present 
outside the court 
the informants testimony could be taken by a police officer and 
then presented to the grand jury he said 
connecticut state police loaned two body dogs and 
massachusetts state police added one to the search monday martin 
said 
three of the eight victims found along routes 140 88 and 
interstate 195 in towns near new bedford were discovered by police 
dogs 
massachusetts has 15 patrol dogs that have undergone a 10 to 
16week course to learn to search for bodies according to state 
trooper kathy barrett whose german shephard cyros has been busy 
in the highway killings case 
cyros is also trained to do routine patrol work and search for 
missing persons or fugitives the connecticut dogs under the 
direction of trooper andy rebman work only on body searches 
rebman trains many of the regions police body dogs as part 
of a new england consortium of state police 
at first handlers try to make a game out of the training by 
inserting the smell of a decaying corpse on a favorite toy or 
ball the trainers then hide the ball in thick brush and the dog 
seeks it 
the smell is placed on the ball with cadavarine a compound 
that simulates the odor of a dead body it is also known as 
15diaminopentane and sold by pfaltz and bauer inc of waterbury 
conn 
cadaverine is a chemical equivalent of the gases and odors 
that are given off by a decaying body said new hampshire state 
police cpt ernest loomis 
new hampshire had its first dog trained for body work just six 
months ago loomis said handlers are careful to wear rubber gloves 
when training kaizer with the cadaverine because of the potent and 
longlasting nature of the odor 
a little of it goes a long way he said 
massachusetts state trooper walter keenan whose shephard 
stark does body work said cadavarine sells for about 50 an ounce

here is a brief overview of the 23year 
war in namibia between the south africanled security forces and 
the guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization 
origin swapo began military operations in 1966 after south 
africa defied a united nations resolution to relinquish control of 
the territory it had captured from the germans in world war i an 
estimated 20000 people mostly swapo guerrillas have been killed 
fighting almost all the fighting has taken place in northern 
namibia and involved bush battles and sabotage attacks carried out 
by swapo forces that infiltrated from bases in southern angola 
swapo has never been able to establish permanent bases inside 
namibia and only a small number of guerrillas have been active in 
the territory at any time until the fighting in recent days both 
sides had observed an informal ceasefire since august 
size south african military officials estimate swapo has 8000 
members in its military wing swapo says it also has 80000 
supporters at refugee camps outside namibia although the un has 
put the figure at about 60000 
south africa had an estimated 50000 troops in namibia 
concentrated in the north the figure includes namibians belonging 
to the southwest africa territorial force the number must be 
reduced to 12000 by midmay and 1500 by july 1 under the peace 
accords signed last december 
also south africa has agreed to cut the territorial police 
force from 8300 to 6000 during the independence process 
the united nations has authorized 4650 peacekeeping troops for 
the operation but only about 1000 have arrived 
angola in the civil war in neighboring angola 50000 cuban 
troops have supported the marxist government in its fight against 
the unita rebel movement which is backed by the united states and 
until the recent peace accord south africa 
unita bases in southern angola are to the east of the swapo 
camps the two guerrilla groups are hostile toward one another but 
have virtually no contact the cubans and the angolans support 
swapo but do not directly assist the guerrillas with attacks 
inside namibia

a witness on monday quoted the late cia 
director william casey as saying president reagan had designated 
oliver north to handle the nicaraguan contras military needs in 
the event of a congressional ban on official us aid 
vincent cannistraro a defense witness in norths trial said 
casey made the statement in the spring of 1984 during a meeting at 
the cia attended by cia official duane clarridge the cia station 
chief in costa rica joseph fernandez and a contra leader who was 
not identified 
the witness said at the outset of his testimony that he was 
knowledgeable about activities of the cia in support of the contras 
in the two years before the ban on aid went into effect and he 
intimated but never said that he was with the cia at the time he 
said that in september 1984 he went to work for thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane and had an office next door to 
norths 
it had become obvious cannistraro said that in the fiscal year 
starting in october 1984 congress would cut off funds for the 
contras 
he bill casey speaking on behalf of the president of the 
united states wanted to assure the freedom fighters that the us 
government would find a way to support them after the ban took 
effect cannistraro testified he said colonel north would not be 
subject to those restrictions 
casey died in 1987 
north maintained in congressional testimony that he acted in the 
belief that the ban applied only to intelligence agencies and not 
the national security council where he was an aide 
reagan told the tower commission on jan 26 1987 that he did 
not know that the nsc staff was engaged in helping the contas 
charges against north include allegations that he concealed from 
congress and former attorney general edwin meese iii his efforts on 
behalf of the contras 
at a subsequent meeting attended by north and contra leader 
adolfo calero cannistraro said there was more specific 
discussion that colonel north would be responsible at the white 
house after october 1984 the only one dealing with the contras on 
paramilitary support 
cannistraro was asked by us district judge gerhard gesell who 
had given authority for that arrangement and he quoted casey as 
having said earlier that he had discussed this with the president 
of the united states and agreed with the president this is how it 
should be handled 
earlier monday a texas woman who contributed more than 2 
million to help the nicaraguan guerrillas asserted firmly and at 
times indignantly that north never directly asked for or received 
money from her while he was a white house aide 
that was a lie ellen garwood testified when told of a 
fundraisers earlier testimony at norths trial that she may have 
signed a 75000 check in norths office she said north did 
describe desperate contra needs to her but the fundraiser 
didnt ask for the money until after they had left 
mrs garwood was the second defense witness she followed former 
marine corps commandant paul x kelley who testified that he 
reluctantly extended norths tour at the national security council 
three times after high administration officials persuaded him that 
north was needed there 
also monday the supreme court refused to scuttle norths trial 
or block the trials of two of his codefendants former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim 
the three had sought dismissal of all charges arguing that 
grand jurors and grand jury witnesses were exposed to the highly 
publicized congressional testimony they had given under a limited 
grant of immunity from prosecution 
the justices did not give a reason for rejecting the argument 
however in a separate case last week the court ruled that federal 
criminal defendants who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their 
indictments because of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot 
appeal before they are convicted 
mrs garwood said she had met north a half dozen times and that 
he had briefed her on the contra fight on aug 23 1985 before she 
signed a check 
colonel north showed me a map of central america he said 
this is a desperate situation for the freedom fighters im not 
asking you for money as a member of the government and the 
national security council i cannot ask you for money she 
testified 
mrs garwood who lives in austin texas said she left norths 
office in the white house complex with fundraiser carl channell en 
route to a hotel across a small park 
mr channell asked me for money after we left she said 
we were probably a half block away from the hotel he asked can 
you give 75000 to help the situation i wrote a check for that 
amount 
when he testified march 8 channell was asked whether she signed 
the check in norths office 
or very shortly thereafter an hour at the most channell 
said when the question was asked a second time channell said i 
think it was right there in that office 
mrs garwood said her father then a state department official 
had worked on the marshall plan that helped save greece and turkey 
from communism after world war ii 
i felt if greece and turkey were threatened how much more the 
people of nicaragua she said 
mrs garwood told of a second contribution of 32000 that she 
made after a meeting with north and rebel leader calero at a dallas 
airport 
while colonel north was present did channell ask for money 
asked defense lawyer brendan sullivan 
no he never did colonel north wouldnt have allowed it 
in april 1986 mrs garwood met with reagan after lunch to 
have sanka on a trip to washington which resulted in her giving 
2 million to the contras largely through donations of stock 
certificates

energy secretary james d watkins on monday 
told congress he expects to give final approval by august to a plan 
for restarting an idled nuclear reactor in south carolina that 
makes materials for atomic weapons 
watkins told a special panel of the house armed service 
committee he had begun reviewing restart recommendations from 
westinghouse electric corp which operates the savannah river site 
reactors under an energy department contract 
he indicated that while he was pleased with westinghouses 
approach to attempting to resolve the safety and managerial 
problems at the site near aiken sc its recommendations fell 
short of what is needed to get the plant back in operation 
we have im afraid a lot more work to do than i see even in 
that plan at this point watkins said 
he said a series of reviews by energy department officials and 
outside experts will be undertaken to ensure a safe resumption of 
tritium production at savannah river tritium is a radioactive gas 
needed in the production of nuclear warheads 
the three active reactors at savannah river have been shut down 
for nearly a year because of safety structural and managerial 
problems a massive campaign has been underway in recent months to 
retrain reactor operators upgrade some plant equipment and 
establish more energy department control of operations there 
earlier this year the energy department had said it was aiming 
to restart the k reactor at savannah river by the end of the year 
it said a further delay would put a serious pinch on supplies of 
tritium thus undermining national security 
watkins appeared to suggest that a restart was not likely until 
1990 although he said it is too early to say for certain when a 
safe restart can be accomplished 
he said he had detected some significant voids in restart 
preparations shortly after he was nominated for the energy job in 
january that we were not addressing in my opinion sufficiently 
and could well have delayed unnecessarily the reactor startup next 
year 
watkins stressed several times during his testimony that much 
work remains to be done before he will be ready to authorize a 
resumption of reactor operations 
the steps we have to take for a safe starting will be totally 
different than anything we have done in the past he said 
watkins also reaffirmed the bush administrations committment to 
winning congressional approval for a 68 billion project to build 
a new generation of tritiumproducing reactors one at savannah 
river and another in idaho to replace the current savannah river 
complex which was built in the early 1950s 
the department has encountered opposition to the plan by some 
legislators and environmental groups critics say no more than one 
new reactor is necessary but watkins said he wants extra 
production capacity in case of emergencies 
this duality makes strategic sense he said since it would 
mean no loss of nuclear capability in the event an earthquake or 
other natural disaster disabled one reactor

iran recalled its ambassador to ankara on 
monday in apparent retaliation for a similar decision announced 
earlier by turkey 
turkeys decision followed a string of incidents which have 
severely strained relations in recent weeks it also reflected 
official anger at iranian efforts to export the islamic revolution 
to turkey which takes pride in its secular system 
staterun tehran television monitored in nicosia quoted an 
unidentified spokesman at the iranian foreign ministry as saying 
the decision to recall ambassador manouchehr mottaki stemmed from 
the turkish governments unprincipled and unfriendly treatment of 
the iranian ambassador 
hours earlier nuzhet kandemir a turkish foreign 
undersecretary told reporters that ambassador omer akbel will be 
recalled from tehran within a week 
kandemir said iran had shown an unaccustomed and bothersome 
interest in a recent decision by turkeys constitutional court to 
ban turkish university women from wearing traditional islamic 
headscarves on campus 
iranians marched in tehran to protest the decision and the 
iranian staterun radio broadcast commentaries critical of the ban 
iranian spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini denounced 
the ruling in a speech last month and voiced support for 
demonstrations by turkish moslem fundamentalists against the ban 
kandemir also criticized the activities of the iranian 
ambassador in turkey noting that mottaki took a prominent role at 
a rally organized by a political party the religious prosperity 
party 
he also cited a recent statement to turkish newspapers by 
mottaki who reportedly said iran would reduce its imports from 
turkey because of the headscarf controversy 
kandemir said the ambassador had been warned several times to 
refrain from such statements 
the resurgence of revolutiary puritanism in iran follows 
khomeinis death sentence on british novelist salman rushdie for 
allegedly blaspheming islam in his book the satanic verses 
fourteen european countries called home their ambassadors for 
consultations to protest khomeinis edict and iran later severed 
ties with britain over the affair

three former defense contracting 
executives heard themselves accused of bribing cheating 
lying on monday at the start of the first trial stemming from the 
federal investigation into fraud in the pentagons purchasing 
system 
the defendants lawyers said they had done nothing wrong 
the three former teledyne electronics executives george kaub 
dale schnittjer and eugene sullivan are charged with bribery 
conspiracy and making false statements in an indictment handed up 
by the grand jury three months ago 
all worked for the newbury park calif company that is a 
subsidiary of teledyne ndustries which has already pleaded guilty 
in the case in addition a former navy procurement official and 
two private consultants have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate 
with prosecutors 
this is a case about bribing about cheating about lying 
said assistant us attorney robert dehenzel jr in his opening 
arguments in the case before us district judge richard williams 
dehenzel outlined a complicated scheme in which he said the 
executives agreed to pay money to private consultant william 
parkin who in turn indirectly bribed a navy official stuart 
berlin for inside information about a 24 million contract to 
build handheld radar test equipment the middleman between parkin 
and berlin was consultant fred lackner dehenzel said 
berlin provided lackner with confidential information a 
lot of the information should not have been given to anyone outside 
government he said 
kaub and sullivan were initially involved in agreeing to a 
10000 contract that parkin had with teledyne starting in late 
1985 the prosecutor said the initial contract called for parkin 
to provide help in reversing a decision that might have dimmed 
teledynes chances for the contract by setting it aside for a small 
business entity 
once teledyne was awarded the deal in june 1987 the agreement 
called for parkin to receive 150000 over two years for his 
services the prosecutor said 
kaub was teledyne electronics executive vice president dealing 
with government contracts sullivan and his successor schnittjer 
were also executive vice presidents 
lawyers for the three men denied that their clients had done 
anything wrong and argued that they were victims of a conspiracy 
between parkin and his associates 
no one can be found guilty unless they know what is going 
on said george oconnell sullivans attorney 
mark tuohey kaubs attorney told the jury that when they 
evaluate the evidence they will find there was a conspiracy of 
silence between parkin and those whom he had agreed to pay for 
his information 
schnittjers attorney stan mortenson said his client didnt 
even begin work at the newbury park facility until a month after 
the government contract was negotiated schnittjer is an innocent 
victim wrongly charged with 14 crimes mortenson said 
the governments first witness in the case charles jones an 
air force contracting officer testified that if information was 
released to one contractor the same data should have been made 
available to everyone 
the government began its investigation into the 
150billionayear pentagon procurement system nearly three years 
ago but the probe was not publicly revealed until june 1988 agents 
used telephone wiretaps and taperecorded conversations to gather 
evidence in the case that centers on allegations that consultants 
paid bribes to get information useful to their clients in winning 
contracts 
the tapes are expected to be played in court

president bush who once captained the yale 
baseball team pitched his first ball as president monday at the 
season opener between the baltimore orioles and the boston red sox 
as the president of egypt and a sellout crowd of 54000 looked 
on southpaw bush hurled a gameopening pitch that was a little 
high and outside orioles catcher mickey tettleton had no problem 
snagging it over his right shoulder 
he caught it before it started breaking bush insisted 
afterwards 
bush brought with him egyptian president hosni mubarak who told 
reporters this was the first baseball game he had been to although 
i saw it on television several times 
bush defended his pitch later during a picturetaking session in 
a glassenclosed box above third base 
what do you think youre an objective judge he asked 
baseball great ted williams a longtime friend 
a high hard fastball williams answered 
bush then asked a bartlett giamatti the commissioner of 
baseball for his opinion superb i didnt see it but i 
heard the commissioner said 
bush and mubarak munched on hamburgers and hot dogs and drank 
soft drinks in orioles cups 
at one point mubarak put on an orioles baseball cap for 
photographers bushs tie was in the orioles team colors orange 
and black 
mubarak said that he was enjoying the game and that bush was a 
good teacher of course he was the captain of the biggest team in 
the united states 
thats what i told him joked bush 
also in the box were secretary of state james a baker iii 
chief of staff john sununu and budget director richard darman 
wearing a red sox cap

tobacco plants may be enlisted in the war 
on cancer by a spray that turns them into factories for making 
anticancer drugs sunscreen and other useful chemicals an 
executive said monday 
its a way to use tobacco for products other than cigarettes 
for smoking said geneticist robert l erwin president of 
biosource genetics corp a privately held company backed by 
venture capitalists 
this technology might be a way to reduce the cost of producing 
many medically important chemicals 
erwin said the vacaville calif company has applied for 
patents on a method of genetically engineering tobacco plants so 
they can produce various desired products biosource genetics also 
wants to patent the process to help make melanin a natural skin 
pigment that might be used as a more effective sunscreen to prevent 
skin cancer from ultraviolet sunlight 
experiments so far have been performed indoors where tobacco 
plants and cells successfully produced two enzymes to test the 
method as well as an enzyme that helps make melanin erwin said 
during the american cancer societys annual seminar for science 
writers 
within 12 months the privately held company hopes to conduct 
field tests of tobacco genetically engineered to produce the 
anticancer drug interleukin2 and serum albumin a major protein 
in blood that is used as a supplement in transfusions 
erwin said other potential products of genetically altered 
tobacco include an insecticide a substance that allows the 
timerelease of flavors in foods and fragrances in perfumes 
enzymes to help make paper and reduce cholesterol levels in foods 
and other cancer drugs such as interferon and vincristine 
biosource genetics used tobacco plants because they are 
wellunderstood easily manipulated and serve as plant researchers 
equivalent of the laboratory mouse erwin said the company was 
considering the same method to genetically alter pepper potato 
and tomato plants he added 
the effort to convert tobacco plants into living factories for 
the cheap mass production of industrial chemicals medicines and 
cosmetics drew criticism from an environmental group but it also 
garnered interest from a tobacco growers group and cautious praise 
from the former director of the national cancer institute 
dr vincent t devita jr who left nci last year to become 
physicianinchief at new yorks memorial sloankettering cancer 
center said he thought the possibility of using tobacco to fight 
cancer instead of causing it is really kind of cute 
its a very interesting idea devita said it sounds too 
good to be true but looks real enough to pursue 
andrew kimbrell attorney and policy director for the 
antibiotechnology foundation on economic trends said a substance 
sprayed on tobacco plants to profoundly change what they produce 
could go to other plants with results unknown we have real 
concerns about what other plants it might affect 
erwin said his companys method is safe because the spray 
degrades quickly creates only a temporary genetic change in the 
tobacco plants and the changes are not passed from plant to plant 
or from one generation of plants to the next 
the process should help make the cigarette habit increasingly 
expensive as tobacco production is shunted into more constructive 
end uses he said 
reginald lester managing director of the tobacco growers 
information committee in raleigh nc said certainly growers 
would be interested in taking a look at this if it could be shown 
to be commercially viable 
biosource genetics alters tobacco plants by spraying them with 
molecules of rna part of the fundamental hereditary information 
of all living things taken from the tobacco mosaic virus and 
encased in a protein coating 
this viruslike substance invades the plant carrying with it a 
gene or hereditary command that orders production of the desired 
chemical 
because the new genetic command dies with the plant a farmer 
would plant tobacco then decide later in the season whether to 
sell it for cigarettes or spray it to produce a medicine or 
industrial chemical erwin said a different spray could be used the 
next season to make the tobacco produce another substance

legislators on monday approved the new 
governments program which includes a peace plan to end the 
6yearold civil war in southern sudan 
the peace plan endorsed the suspension of islamic law 
suspending sharia is a key demand of the rebels most of whom are 
africandescended christians or animists northern sudan and the 
government are dominated by moslems and fundamentalist moslems 
have vowed stiff and even violent opposition to the removal of 
islamic law 
it generally had been assumed that legislative approval of the 
peace plan would automatically freeze action on a bill to amend the 
existing shariabased penal code but the bill is scheduled to go 
to the assembly tuesday indicating the issue has not been 
resolved provisions of the amended law drawn up by a 
parliamentary committee have not been disclosed 
after mondays vote assembly speaker yusuf ahmed yusuf said 
endorsement does not necessarily mean dropping other bills 
the remark by yusuf a member of the fundamentalist national 
islamic front was seen as a challenge to the promised suspension 
of islamic law 
sudans constituent assembly voted 12823 for the policy 
statement prime minister sadek mahdi presented after creating a 
peace cabinet under pressure from the armed forces the colonels 
had demanded mahdi make peace with the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army or step down 
about 100 legislators abstained from voting on the measure but 
mahdis umma party and its coalition partners command more than 200 
seats to the islamic fronts 50 
mahdis peace plan calls for a ceasefire an end to a state of

plo chairman yasser arafats chief 
adviser on monday welcomed a call by president bush for a middle 
east peace conference and israels withdrawal from its occupied 
territories as an important and serious development 
bassam abu sharif told the associated press the palestine 
liberation organization feels this will give a real push for 
peace efforts in the middle east 
we hope that the positive position of president bush would 
convince the israeli government that peace could be established in 
the middle east on the basis of a twostate solution two states 
living sidebyside in peace abu sharif said 
bush also told a white house news conference after a meeting 
with egyptian president hosni mubarak that he supported 
achievement of palestinian political rights 
earlier the plo central committee ending a fourday meeting in 
tunis ruled out any letup in the palestinian uprising in the west 
bank and gaza strip in exchange for israelisponsored elections 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir announced last week his 
government would allow limited elections in the occupied 
territories and withdraw troops from major arab cities if the 
palestinian uprising stopped 
but the israeli leader due in washington for talks this week 
envisions only limited autonomy for the palestinians and refuses to 
talk with the plo which he views as a terrorist group 
the central committee announced to the world that the 
intefadeh uprising will not cease and our peoples struggle will 
continue said the statement telefaxed to the ap in cyprus by the 
official palestinian press agency wafa 
at least 419 palestinians and 16 israelis have been killed in 
the nearly 16monthold uprising against israels military 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the 70member central committee is an interim group of the 
450seat palestine national council which is scheduled to meet 
once a year the central committee and the smaller 15member 
executive committee make policy recommendations to be weighed by 
the full body 
the central committee reviewed the united statesplo talks 
welcomed the continuation of these talks and stressed their 
importance the statement said the united states began talks 
with the plo in december for the first time in 13 years after 
arafat renounced terrorism and said he recognized israels right to 
exist 
also monday the persian gulf newspaper alkhaleej reported that 
tunisia had barred the entry of abul abbas the leader of the 
palestine liberation front who has accused of masterminding the 
hijacking of the italian cruise vessel achille lauro in 1985 
alkhaleej a united arab emirates newspaper based in sharjah 
quoted a palestine liberation front source as saying abul abbas was 
not able to attend the central committee meeting 
abul abbas was asked to stop trying to enter tunisia but the 
tunisian government gave no reason for banning him said the 
unnamed source in a dispatch from algeria 
there was no immediate confirmation of the report from tunisia 
where the plo umbrella for all guerrilla factions including abbas 
group is headquartered 
abul abbas whose full name is mohammed abbas has been branded 
as a terrorist in the united states since the 1985 incident in 
which an american citizen 69yearold leon klinghoffer was killed 
the united states reportedly wants abul abbas expelled from the 
plo and the paper which is known for its hardline stance on the 
palestinian issue dropped hints that arafat was complying 
abul abbas was convicted in absentia in an italian court and 
sentenced to life for the achille lauro affair

jackhammer crews monday began breaking 
up 200 tons of concrete that crashed down on at least three cars 
and a tractortrailer truck when a section of a us highway bridge 
collapsed into a river 
seven people died and an eighth was reported missing in the 
accident saturday night about 50 miles north of memphis 
authorities planned to bring in a 60ton national guard crane to 
remove the concrete once engineers pronounced the bridge safe to 
support the equipment said jim thacker regional manager of the 
tennessee emergency management agency 
a possible eighth victim was a local man missing since saturday 
night when the bridge fell 
hes missing and he should have been on this road at that 
time said jacky carter an investigator with the emergency agency

bill tucker county executive for lauderdale county said 
authorities know of no other local residents who might be in the 
river 
theres a possibility that somebody from out of state or 
something could be somewhere further on down but thats just a 
remote possibility tucker said we think weve got it isolated 
to one area 
but terry petty a diver with the tennessee highway patrol said 
the water was so dark it was hard to tell if other vehicles might 
be in the river the current was eight to 10 knots he said 
with this current if a car went off after it fell and was 
not trapped under the concrete it could be a mile down the 
river petty said 
the 55yearold bridge eighttenths of a mile long carried two 
northbound lanes of us highway 51 across the hatchie river about

a strong earthquake shook the san 
francisco peninsula on monday but there were no immediate reports 
of injury or serious damage 
i went outside and watched the windows rattle said marcey 
beaupre manager of the super yarn mart in nearby santa clara i 
got 20 windows and all they did was rattle nothing happened 
the us geological survey set a preliminary magnitude of 50 on 
the richter scale for the temblor while the university of 
californias seismographic stations at berkeley rated it at 44 
a 50 quake is considered powerful enough to cause considerable 
damage in populated areas 
witnesses reported a rolling quake lasting 15 to 20 seconds it 
was felt in most of the san francisco bay area including as far 
north at petaluma and in the region south and east of san jose 
usgs spokeswoman pat jorgenson said the quake struck at 1046 
am on the calaveras fault and was centered eight miles east of 
milpitas about 50 miles southeast of san francisco 
we dont have any reports of major damage said vince 
montane regional manager of the state office of emergency 
services the cities and counties have called in with a few 
instances of broken glass and plates falling off shelves and 
pictures off the walls and that kind of thing 
a 100squarefoot pane of glass shattered in the control tower 
at reidhillview airport showering glass into the parking lot 
three stories below no injuries were reported 
there were reports of telephone outages but pacific bell 
officials blamed it on overloaded circuits 
april 18 is the anniversary of the great san francisco 
earthquake of 1906 which triggered fires which destroyed most of 
the city 
the openended richter scale is a measure of the energy released 
by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a 
seisomograph 
each increase of one number as in a jump from magnitude 55 to 
65 means that the ground motion is 10 times greater a quake of 
35 can cause slight damage in populated areas while a quake of 
60 can cause severe damage in march 1964 an earthquake in alaska 
hit 85 on the richter scale killing 114 people

the justice departments ethics office found 
no basis to investigate an allegation that attorney general dick 
thornburgh planned to use a government computer for political 
purposes officials said monday 
the office of professional responsibility conducted a 
preliminary inquiry after an unidentified person alleged that last 
fall thornburgh aides sought to compile a list of the attorney 
generals contacts dating back to his days as pennsylvania 
governor said david runkel a special assistant to the attorney 
general 
the opr preliminary inquiry concluded there was no basis for 
further investigation of the allegation that the names of 10000 of 
thornburghs political supporters from pennsylvania would be placed 
on the computerized mailing list runkel said 
that had never been contemplated suggested or planned 
runkel said 
but the project has become a matter of dispute in the 
department where some employees jokingly dubbed it dickpac 
reflecting concerns the computerized list would be misused for 
political purposes said a department source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
runkel said the plan still under active consideration was 
merely to put the ags meeting and schedules on computers 
it is envisioned as a way to keep pertinent information about 
the attorney generals contacts so that when thornburgh meets 
with a person he can say we met last july and i know you were 
interested in x y z he said 
there are a lot of people who communicate with the attorney 
general runkel said some are from pennsylvania and some 
obviously are political supporters 
the opr inquiry found there was nothing wrong with using 
justice department computers to keep track of the people thornburgh 
meets runkel said 
the brief report concluded why are we wasting our time on 
this stuff said runkel it concluded this is a 
misunderstanding by one person of what someone else said 
the whole complaint was based on a misunderstanding runkel 
said he declined to release the pageandahalf document saying 
its an investigative report we dont make it public 
the inquiry was conducted after thornburgh aide murray dickman 
asked the office of litigation support in the civil division to 
write a computer program for the project said the department 
source 
the project created consternation in litigation support office 
where those involved feared it might be misused for political 
purposes and violate the justice departments ethics guidelines 
that prohibit use of government facilities for unofficial business 
said the source 
john r bolton the assistant attorney general in charge of the 
civil division confronted dickman and robert ross jr 
thornburghs executive assistant about the project after learning 
of its existence said the source 
runkel also took issue with this account saying there was 
never anything to suspend 
civil got involved in this only because the computers up here 
are hooked into the system it has ownership or has control over 
runkel said 
aides decided that divisions litigation system known as amicus 
was not a good idea runkel said 
runkel said aides concluded they could use it on some pc and 
buy a 50 program and start plugging it in 
bolton declined to comment dickman did not return a reporters 
telephone call

the prosecution and defense agreed monday 
that a man who killed six people in a shopping center rampage was 
mentally ill but the prosecutor said it was no excuse 
prosecutor larry holmes told jurors the evidence was so 
overwhelming that william cruse killed with premediation that cruse 
had no other choice but to plead innocent by reason of insanity 
mental illness was the motivator for the crime not its 
justification said holmes arguing that mental illness is not 
enough for acquittal under florida law 
holmess cocounsel assistant state attorney chris white 
argued that cruse had acted out of anger not illness 
hoisting the ruger 223caliber semiautomatic assault rifle used 
in the rampage the prosecutor added that cruse had purchased the 
perfect weapon for mass murder 
the defense contended that cruse 61 was driven by delusions 
about homosexuality and was unable to control his actions when he 
began shooting people at two shopping centers 
public defender marlene alva said cruse was temporarily insane 
and therefore couldnt be convicted of premeditated firstdegree 
murder 
you have here before you a madman a crazy person someone who 
went berserk on april 23 1987 she said 
six people including two policemen were killed and 10 were 
wounded in the bloody rampage in palm bay on floridas east coast 
the state is seeking the death penalty on six counts of murder 24 
counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping 
after arguments by attorneys the jury was to return tuesday 
morning for instructions by the judge before deliberating cruses 
fate 
much of the morning monday was spent in argument over whether to 
admit testimony by tampa forensic psychiatrist robert berland 
berland told the court out of the presence of the jury that 
cruse was so psychotically fearful of attack that he always 
carried a gun always slept with a gun always kept a knife 
ready for a quick draw 
white objected to the introduction of the testimony at this 
point in the 4weekold trial saying much of the information had 
been obtained by berland in midmarch after the trial started and 
from cruse himself 
circuit judge john antoon overruled the objection on hearsay but 
agreed the defense could have presented such findings earlier 
to do so now antoon said would give the defendant an unfair 
advantage or would force the state to bring in other testimony 
and allow the war of experts to go on and on 
four other psychiatrists and a psychologist testified 
disagreeing sharply on whether cruse legally was temporarily insane 
when he systematically picked off victim after victim at two 
shopping centers 
under floridas definition of temporary insanity the defense 
must show that cruse not only was mentally ill but did not know 
the consequences of his actions or that they were wrong

clear but some sources are the black market and relatives friends 
or other connections in the west 
a similar rush of hungarian customers who can travel to the 
west without visas as often as they want was registered nov 7 
1988 when more than 100000 hungarians went shopping across the 
border 
on monday traffic was snarled in many parts of burgenland 
austrias easternmost province and thousands of hungarian cars 
contributed to the usual congestion in vienna

a leading soviet economist said monday that 
officials are debating establishment of a second currency that 
would be convertible and backed by gold foreign currency reserves 
and export goods 
abel aganbegyan secretary of the economics department of the 
academy of sciences said the specialpurpose ruble would be issued 
in amounts large enough to facilitate foreign trade which is now 
hampered by the soviet unions shortage of hard currency 
it could be tied in with proposals to create special foreign 
trade zones on the finnish border and in the soviet far east where 
foreign firms would enjoy tariff tax and other benefits he said 
he noted that the gold ruble as some have called the 
proposed currency is still just an idea and is opposed by some 
soviet economists he alluded to the fact that it would have to be 
accepted by the major western banks to work 
pepsico chairman donald kendall speaking at the same news 
conference said that some companies would buy a hard ruble and 
some would not but id certainly rather have a goldbacked ruble 
than the one we have now 
pepsico is one of the soviet unions major trading partners 
exchanging pepsi for stolichnaya vodka 
the second currency would be an interim step while the soviet 
union is trying to bring the regular ruble closer to 
convertibility aganbegyan said 
officials say that may take a decade or more as the soviet 
union now has little to sell on world markets and the official 
exchange rate of 160 to the ruble is far too high in comparison 
the black market rate is 1025 cents per ruble

the united states announced new measures to 
combat sky terrorism monday as relatives of passengers killed in 
the pan am flight 103 bombing mounted a highprofile campaign to 
complain about aviation security and the governments lack of 
compassion following the disaster 
transportation secretary samuel skinner who along with 
president bush met with several relatives of those killed in the 
explosion over scotland told a news conference that airlines will 
be required to install devices to detect plastic explosives in 
major us and foreign airports 
relatives of victims in the dec 21 explosion over scotland 
which has been blamed on a plastic device hidden in a 
radiocassette player praised bush for concern shown in the 
meeting and said skinners announcement was a good first step 
but spokesman bert ammerman of demarest nj told a rally 
across the street from the white house that measures announced by 
skinner were not enough 
ammerman whose brother tom was one of 270 victims of the crash 
asked for a unified congressional investigation of the disaster 
handsearching of all luggage put aboard airliners and an end to a 
system that allows notification only of airline airport and 
government security personnel when theres a terrorist threat 
skinner said he would recommend against a coordinated 
congressional inquiry although bush told the relatives he would 
consider pressing for such a probe as opposed to several separate 
congressional investigations skinner said the fbi and scotland 
yard were best qualified to conduct the criminal investigation and 
there is no indication government response to the explosion has 
been inadequate 
meantime cbs news quoting unidentified intelligence sources 
said new antiamerican attacks may be coming the television 
network said the group that is believed to have been involved in 
the bombing of flight 103 is planning new attacks on american 
targets 
cbs said a terrorist coalition is plotting revenge attacks in 
about 10 days which would be the third anniversary of the us 
bombing of tripoli and the headquarters of libyan leader col 
gadhafi the libyan secret service has asked three terrorist groups 
to design the attacks the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command abu nidel one of worlds most infamous 
terrorists and the japanese red army cbs said 
the transportation secretary in his announcement also ordered 
airlines to acknowledge all federal aviation administration 
security bulletins within 24 hours he said compliance would be 
mandatory 
such bulletins tell airlines of possible threats and sometimes 
recommend steps that can be taken to avert them in the past such 
recommendations generally have been advisory 
skinner said the government would help negotiate for the 
installation in foreign airports of the latest thermal neutron 
analysis equipment which can detect plastic explosives but 
airlines would have to pay the cost estimated at up to 100 
million or more to cover major airports 
skinner gave no timetable for installing the devices an faa 
official speaking on condition of anonymity said it could take 
years to get all of the units installed 
the government has plans to install six such devices which cost 
nearly 1 million each in various airports before the end of the 
year skinner said cost of the equipment likely would add between 
20 cents and a dollar to each airline ticket 
additional faa security specialists were being sent to the 
busiest us and foreign airports to aid in surveillance skinner 
said he also announced that the faa will propose changes in 
security programs to require stateoftheart xray and 
metaldetection equipment in airports and to require that airline 
pilots get appropriate security information 
more than 150 relatives and friends of flight 103 victims 
gathered in a church near the white house for prayers poetry 
reading and songs remembering loved ones killed in the explosion 
103 days ago over lockerbie scotland 
the relatives have complained that the administration gave them 
little information or comfort after the bombing 
the group said neither former president reagan nor bush called 
any family members to offer personal condolences to any family 
members of those aboard the flight 
paul hudson of albany ny who lost his 16yearold daughter 
melina said that relatives of hostage victims told bush pointblank 
that they thought the government failed to respond adequately 
the opinion of the group was absolute outrage at the lack of 
compassion the incompetence and frankly the embarrassment that 
we suffered with our state department services hudson said we 
had to deal with foreign governments as an organization and 
individually virtually alone and we have heard from other victims 
of terrorist actions that we are not the first to have experienced 
this the president assured us that this sort of thing would be 
corrected 
following the session a white house statement said bush had 
expressed his sorrow and deep concern about the incident and 
termed the meeting sensitive solemn and productive 
at the church relatives wearing tags with the names of loved 
ones killed in the bombing and pins saying the truth must be 
known wept as they sang on eagles wings a hymn 
we want a full investigation said george williams 
joppatowne md whose 24yearold son geordie died in the crash 
while en route home for christmas from a military assignment i 
dont care who forgets it but i will not forget it 
bob monetti said relatives organized their group to support each 
other through a sorrowful time to help make air travel safer and 
to push for more effective federal policy in combatting air 
terrorism monetti lost his son rick a 20yearold journalism

the westinghouse electric co began its first 
full week of operations at the savannah river nuclear weapons plant 
monday by conceding the difficulty of the task it faces 
but officials at westinghouse the worlds largest builder of 
commercial nuclear power plants expressed confidence they would be 
able to gain public confidence and restart three idle reactors at 
the problemplagued plant 
on saturday ei du pont de nemours amp co ended 38 years as 
operator of the nations largest nuclear weapons facility turning 
the plant over to westinghouse savannah river co a subsidiary of 
the pittsburghbased parent 
weve been convinced that we can make this a model of 
excellence westinghouse savannah river co president james s 
moore said at a news conference monday 
the savannah river plant which westinghouse renamed the 
savannah river site is the nations only source of tritium a 
highly radioactive gas used at other government defense plants to 
make nuclear warheads 
the three active nuclear reactors at the plant have been shut 
down for nearly a year because of safety and structural problems 
and a series of mishaps in recent months has raised doubts about 
whether improvements are likely anytime soon 
moore said a new name and freshly painted signs at the 
300squaremile complex near aiken will not erase the facilitys 
troubled history 
our first task now that transition is over is to enhance the 
public trust and obviously ensure a safe restart of the 
reactors said moore whose company has a fiveyear contract 
the ultimate way to gain trust is to perform actions speak 
louder than words 
he stressed that westinghouse would not jeopardize safety for 
production 
we are not putting production ahead of safety even if they 
tell us to he said referring to the federal government 
the pentagon has said that unless at least one of the reactors 
is restarted by the end of the year it might have to deactivate 
some warheads to preserve supplies of tritium 
moore said a clause in the companys contract with the 
department of energy allows me to go directly to doe 
headquarters if i feel im being told to do something contrary to 
what we believe is right or safe 
my view is that if i have to do that ive failed on my job 
because ive failed to communicate with my customer here at the 
site 
moore also said he would shut down the reactors if the energy 
department asked for more tritium than could be produced safely in 
the alotted time 
the doe has tied the amount of money westinghouse will be paid 
to how well it performs

the government media on monday denounced 
reports in the american press saying iraq plans to produce nuclear 
warheads 
front page editorials in three staterun newspapers accused 
israel of orchestrating a campaign that they said was aimed at 
defaming iraq and influencing the peace talks with iran iran 
and iraq agreed to a ceasefire in august that ended their 
eightyearold war 
the papers did not specifically deny the reports about nuclear 
weapons 
last week the washington post said iraq has embarked on a crash 
program to produce a nuclear warhead within two years 
an israeli general said sunday there was some basis to reports 
that iraq is engaged in an effort to build nuclear warheads for 
missiles that could reach israel 
maj gen ehud barak deputy armed forces chief of staff in an 
interview on israeli television was asked about the washington 
post report and he said iraq has not abandoned its aim to reach 
nuclear capability as far as i know these reports have at least a 
nucleus of truth 
iraqs governmentowned aljoumhouriya newspaper said the 
reports were leaked by israeli officials to the us media to 
distract world public opinion from the palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories and to pave the way for new attacks 
against iraqi nuclear installations 
if the aim is to frighten iraq and launch a preemptive strike 
you should understand that iraq is fully alert and will be 
ready to answer back with all the potential at its disposal the 
newspaper said 
israeli warplanes destroyed iraqs osirak nuclear reactor in 
1981 
the ruling baath partys althawra newspaper said the american 
press ignored israels nuclear weapons program while spreading lies 
about the alleged danger of iraqs nuclear program 
alqadissiya the army newspaper said any israeli action would 
be dealt with in an appropriate way 
they will get nothing but humiliation disgrace and 
destruction it said

democrat richard m daley worked chicagos 
magnificent mile on monday while his chief rival in tuesdays 
mayoral election campaigned with jesse jackson in a final bid to 
retain black control of city hall 
daley whose ironfisted father ruled chicago for 21 years is 
widely favored to win the race in the nations third largest city 
alderman timothy evans an independent and the lone black in the 
race campaigned at a south side housing project where jackson 
invoked the memory of dr martin luther king the civil rights 
leader murdered 21 years ago 
april 4th 1968 dr king was killed jackson said did 
not our hearts bleed april 4 1968 our backs were against the 
wall bowed down heads broken hearts people rioting 
well april 4th 1989 no more riots and despair voting and 
hope voting and hope he repeated leading a chant of those last 
three words 
earlier daley donned a hard hat at a construction site 
appropriate head gear as he started the the final day of 
campaigning and his opponents prepared their last shots 
tuesdays winner will complete the last two years of the late 
mayor harold washingtons second term washington the citys first 
black mayor suffered a fatal heart attack in november 1987 
daley who defeated acting mayor eugene sawyer in the feb 28 
democratic primary faces evans and republican edward vrdolyak a 
former democrat who hasnt won elective office since switching 
parties in 1987 
while evans 45 who is running on the harold washington party 
ticket and vrdolyak 51 spent quiet mornings daley made his way 
to the construction site along downtown michigan avenues 
magnificent mile shopping strip 
hey rich good seeing you good luck tomorrow called iron 
worker and former daley neighbor jim crowley 24 
daley smiled and shook hands signing a hard hat for greg 
engelman a superintendent engelman said he also had a hat signed 
by daleys father richard j daley mayor from 1955 until his 
death in 1976 
daleys father ran a patronage army and despite later court 
rulings limiting city hiring and firing for political reasons 
evans has often invoked the name of the late daley in warning that 
his son would bring back machine politics to serve only the 
wellconnected 
its all rhetoric daley said monday in an interview on 
wgnam he has often promised an open government and said that as 
cook county states attorney since 1980 he has run a nonpolitical 
shop 
the latest poll results released monday by the daily chicago 
southtown economist and wbbmtv gave daley 51 percent to 35 
percent for evans and 3 percent for vrdolyak 
the telephone poll of 918 registered voters with an error 
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points showed 8 percent 
undecided most of them black in a city where the voting population 
is 48 percent white 42 percent black and 7 percent hispanic 
sawyer lost to daley by more than 100000 votes in the primary 
partly because of low black turnout that many blamed on the battle 
he and evans waged to succeed washington sawyer a black south 
side alderman was selected to be acting mayor by fellow city 
council members tuesdays election was ordered by the state 
supreme court 
the city elections board estimated that 70 percent of chicagos 
156 million voters would go to the polls on a day the national 
weather service said would be windy and cold with the threat of 
rain 
daley won the endorsement of chicagos two largest daily 
newspapers and has a campaign fund reported at about 6 million

janez drnovsek a 38yearold 
slovenian economist will become communist yugoslavias first 
directly elected president next month 
drnovsek a member of the federal parliament virtually unknown 
outside slovenia defeated marko bulc 62 who is president of the 
republics trade chamber in elections sunday for slovenias 
representative to the largely ceremonial collective presidency 
under yugoslavias rotating system the six republics and two 
provinces each have a representative in the presidency and take 
turns leading the nations top body 
this time it is slovenias turn and drnovsek takes over in 
midmay from raif dizdarevic of bosnia the ninth seat in the 
presidency is reserved for the communist party chief 
the economist won 56 percent of votes and bulc 41 percent 
according to unofficial results quoted by the official tanjug news 
agency 
by government count 875 percent of slovenias 147 million 
registered voters took part 
president josip broz tito created the rotating presidency to 
avoid power struggles after his death and prevent the emergence of 
a dominant leader who could disturb the countrys ethnic balance 
slovenia has led the drive for more democracy in this 
singleparty state and has allowed several noncommunist human 
rights and political groups to function freely 
it also has allowed a social democratic union which claims to 
be yugoslavias first independent political party since the 
communists took power after world war ii 
drnovsek who will become yugoslavias youngest president is a 
doctor of economic sciences who worked in several yugoslav 
companies and banks as well as in the diplomatic service 
he reportedly has specialized in his countrys economic matters 
and monetary and credit policies 
drnovsek is a strong supporter of the drive to have nonaligned 
yugoslavia join the european economic community 
bulc and drnovsek remained in the slovenian race from six 
original candidates after a complicated election system began at 
grassroot levels 
previously members of the presidency were elected by republican 
legislatures that gave rubberstamp approval to single candidates 
picked by the communist party 
the southern republic of montenegro will choose its 
representative among three candidates in an april 9 ballot the 
other republics namd their members through the old system 
slovenian candidates were involved in a westernstyle campaign 
of speeches and television debates in which they faced probing 
questions and had to defend their programs 
both candidates called for radical marketoriented reforms to 
overcome the countrys deep economic crisis which includes 400 
percent annual inflation and a 21 billion foreign debt

un investigators have found that 
guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization mounted a 
major invasion from angola into namibia over the weekend according 
to diplomats 
the findings of the un investigators were relayed to 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who briefed security 
council members said three senior diplomats from western nations 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
their findings were incorporated into a report the un chief 
presented to the security council on monday evening under unusually 
heavy security 
more than 1000 swapo guerrillas infiltrated northern namibia 
but their motive was not known said the diplomats 
since fighting broke out saturday 129 swapo guerrillas and 18 
namibian territorial police have been killed according to 
namibias police force 
south africa says the swapo rebels infiltrated namibia from 
southern angola swapo officials say their men were already in the 
country and only fired in selfdefense 
publicly un officials scrupulously avoided making any comment 
that might be interpreted as blaming one side or the other 
but swapos foreign secretary theoben gurirab castigated the 
world body for allowing south african military units to reinforce 
territorial police in their battle against the guerrillas 
our people are being butchered under the united nations 
flag said gurirab 
he spoke as the 15 members of the security council met privately 
to hear the report on the clashes 
part of the mission of the un transition assistance group was 
to see that guerrillas of the south west africa peoples 
organization were confined to bases in angola and zambia and make 
sure no one infiltrated namibia 
however only about 1000 members of untag which was envisioned 
to have a full strength of 4650 peacekeepers were in namibia by 
friday night when gun battles broke out between swapo rebels and 
territorial police 
untag is not yet fully in namibia perez de cuellar said 
we have 300 men in the northern part of the area you cannot say 
it is a failure 
perez de cuellars report in january to the security council on 
untags mission recommended 4650 peacekeepers but also asked for 
authority to send as many as 7500 if the situation required more 
soldiers 
the bulk of the troops are expected to arrive during april 
bringing the force to nearly full strength by the end of the month 
undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding the uns chief 
peacekeeping official was dispatched to luanda angola to meet 
with angolan officials and with three un peacekeepers who 
investigated the weekend clashes 
goulding was expected to arrive in luanda on tuesday 
a western diplomat involved in the negotiations that led up to 
the independence plan for namibia said swapo argued throughout that 
it had fighters in the country who should be allowed to maintain 
unsupervised barracks in namibia on the same basis as south 
africa 
possibly they were trying to get men in at the 11th hour to 
bolster their argument that they had them in namibia and therefore 
they should have bases in the country said the diplomat 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
until saturday the united nations recognized swapo as the 
legitimate representative of the namibian people 
with the inauguration of the unsupervised independence plan 
the united nations recognized swapo as one political force among 
many contending for power in namibia and was to remain impartial

a brilliant blue object with a streaking 
yellow tail that was seen rocketing across colorado skies monday 
may have been a rare daytime meteorite a planetarium spokeswoman 
said 
from all the details we have been able to get it sounds like 
it was a meteorite said suzy gurton program supervisor at fiske 
planetarium in boulder 
we havent been able to determine yet whether it landed or 
exploded before it hit the earth she said 
reported sightings of the object filtered into atmospheric and 
spacerelated agencies shortly after noon from metropolitan denver 
salida in southcentral colorado and garden city and salinas in 
kansas 
we got lots of calls on it it doesnt correlate with anything 
were tracking said capt thomas neiman a spokesman for the 
north american defense command near colorado springs 
norad which tracks about 7000 objects in space received calls 
about the object from federal aviation administration officials at 
longmont and from scott air force base in illinois neiman said 
a spokesman for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration in boulder said he received a query about the object 
from salinas kan 
gurton said one of the people who contacted the planetarium said 
the object had brilliant blue color for the head there was a 
yellow tail streaking behind it 
she said the witnesses indicated it was traveling north but 
where it landed we dont know 
in salida witnesses said there was a loud boom and the object 
appeared to burst into flame 
gurton said it is fairly unusual to see a meteor in the daytime 
it doesnt happen often anywhere she said 
planetarium officials were attempting to pinpoint where the 
meteorite may have landed by tracking the reports they received 
she said

prime minister yitzhak shamir indicated tuesday 
that during his us visit he will state his opposition to 
president bushs call for an end to israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip and his endorsement of an international peace 
conference 
my position on all these issues is known ill have something 
to discuss with the leaders of the united states shamir said as 
he left for a 10day visit to the united states 
we shall insist that negotiations be held within a reasonable 
framework and be conducted directly and without preconditions 
he said 
we are looking for the right solutions for the problems we 
are facing i hope that the leaders of the united states will find 
an interest in our proposals and there are some proposals he 
said at ben gurion airport near tel aviv 
bush speaking monday after meeting in washington with egyptian 
president hosni mubarak called for a properly structured 
middle east peace conference a concept which shamir opposes 
egypt and the united states share the goals of security for 
israel end of the occupation and achievement of palestinian 
political rights bush said 
shortly before shamirs departure about 500 hundred activists 
from the antiwar group peace now marched through downtown 
jerusalem to shamirs residence with burning torches 
they shouted slogans such as talk with the plo and two 
states for two peoples 
its very important that shamir takes into account that a 
large segment of the israeli public sees this special time as an 
historic opportunity to achieve peace with the palestinians said 
tazli reshef a leader of peace now 
arguments broke out with rightwing counterdemonstrators and 
israel radio said five rightwingers were arrested for disturbing 
the march 
shamir has repeatedly rejected an international conference 
saying it would resu lt in other countries ganging up on israel and 
forcing it to yield land that shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
maintains is an inextricable part of israel 
finance minister shimon peres of the labor party shamirs rival 
in the coalition government supports an international conference 
and territorial concessions he said israel had to take the lead in 
peacemaking or suffer a further loss of support in the united 
states 
its clear we have real losses in us public opinion and the 
american public opinion is one of our most important political 
assets he said on israel army radio 
foreign minister moshe arens a close shamir ally said in a 
radio interview he did not expect american pressure to change 
shamirs opposition to talks with the plo or the establishment of 
an independent palestinian state 
yossi ben aharon shamirs chief of staff indicated shamir was 
willing to listen to us proposals for easing tensions in the west 
bank and gaza strip such as freeing some of about 5000 
palestinians held in israeli jails 
we have no problem with such measures as long as they are not 
onesided which would compound the problem and give the impression 
we were knuckling under to pressure he said 
on the other hand ben aharon said in an interview we dont 
need sermons on the conduct of israeli soldiers 
ben aharon said shamir was taking with him some new ideas but 
not a blueprint for middle east peace he stressed that while 
israel was willing to be flexible on some points it would not 
accept even an indirect dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization 
among the proposals is one for elections in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip to choose palestinian representatives for 
negotiations with israel on autonomy for the 17 million arabs 
however prominent palestinians said in interviews the election 
proposal would be unacceptable as long as israel refused to commit 
itself to ending the occupation and declined to deal with the plo 
or accept a palestinian state 
we know that shamir who was an obstructionist throughout his 
life cannot deliver any of these things said saeb erakat a 
political science professor at an najah university in the west bank 
he will take old ideas in new cans under new labels said 
erakat who predicted there would be a new flareup in the nearly 
16monthold uprising if progress was not made soon in peace 
efforts 
hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily al fajr newspaper 
said palestinians would not agree to elections unless israel 
withdrew its troops and turned over control to un peacekeeping 
forces

an attempt by an advertising agency to ship 
videotapes called sex talk and tiger to the cannes film 
festival prompted british officials to bar them as pornography 
in fact the tapes were television ads prepared for the 
massachusetts society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
encouraging pet owners to neuter their dogs and cats 
but customs officers at londons heathrow international airport 
mistook the messages on pet reproduction for films of animal 
attraction a spokeswoman for the ad agency said monday 
regina ryan of cosmopulous crowley amp daly said the tapes and 
two others were intercepted march 16 on their way to the 
international film festival in cannes france which is later in 
the spring 
the festival awards prizes and has a category for public service 
announcements ms ryan said entry rules require each submission 
to have the name of the piece and its length clearly marked on the 
package 
the other spots were liberty mutual insurance cos buried 
treasure about the risk of drunk driving and the salvation 
armys places to eat about hunger and homelessness but 
british customs evidently took one look at the sex talk label 
and decided to send it all back where it came from 
an agent in london notified the cosmopulous agency and 
repackaged tapes stating their destination were sent just in time 
for cannes march 18 deadline ms ryan said 
after all this i hope we win she said

a judge on monday revoked his 
predecessors order for the release of three alleged members of a 
kidnapping ring involving military officers 
judge ricardo mejia angulo of the 3rd criminal court told 
journalists he voided a ruling issued friday afternoon by judge 
hector larios mejia angulos action which included a new order 
for the provisional detention of the three began to calm outrage 
vented following larios surprise order 
the genie is back in the bottle a highranking us 
diplomat said in an interview the united states which provides el 
salvador about 15 million a day in aid was upset by larios 
order 
washington considers prosecution of the kidnapping ring case a 
top priority in establishing a viable judicial system in this 
country 
the kidnappers masquerading as leftist guerrillas abducted 
five wealthy businessmen for ransom between 1980 and 1985 
larios minutes before leaving his post as the head of the 3rd 
criminal court ruled that maj alfredo jimenez moreno former lt 
rodolfo lopez sibrian and wealthy farmer orlando llovera balette 
should be released 
presidentelect alfredo cristiani of the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance party or arena is to meet friday in 
washington with president bush 
diplomatic sources said cristiani called us ambassador william 
walker late friday to inform him of larios order cristiani who 
won the march 19 presidential election by a wide margin over the 
candidate of the incumbent christian democrats was described as 
incensed by larios move 
some arena leaders including cashiered army maj roberto 
daubuisson have been linked to death squads and other rights 
abuses in the early 1980s 
llovera lopez sibrian and jimenez as well as others implicated 
in the kidnapping ring are former friends and associates of 
daubuisson who is an arena legislator 
the us source who commented on condition of anonymity said 
the case was cristianis first human rights test as presidentelect 
he passed with flying colors said the diplomat 
jose guerrero president of the supreme court told journalists 
that larios who transferred to a civil court post monday has been 
suspended pending investigation of his ruling regarding the alleged 
kidnappers 
larios had ruled that the three had been arrested in 1986 under 
emergency legislation no longer in effect making their detentions 
illegal 
only llovera was released his whereabouts were unknown monday 
the release order concerning the other two men was not implemented 
before mejia angulos action 
the judge also issued new arrest warrants replacing those 
cancelled by larios for five other people allegedly involved in 
the ring 
the ring in which at least two fugitive military officers are 
implicated was broken in 1986 when llovera jimenez and lopez 
sibrian were arrested

nicaraguan rebels will observe a 
unilateral ceasefire until february when the sandinista 
government is to hold general elections a source in the rebels 
directorate said monday 
the source who spoke on condition he not be identified said 
commander enrique bermudez told the rebels about the decision 
during visits friday to their camps on the honduran side of the 
border with nicaragua bermudez is the chief military leader of the 
rebels known as contras 
radio liberacion the contras radio station broadcast on 
monday a message from bermudez that said the rebels will not 
launch any attack against the sandinistas until february 1990 we 
will not look for combat but will permanently be on the defensive 
the rebel army will be preserved intact on the defense and 
watching for the sandinistas to fulfill their promise of greater 
democracy for nicaragua 
nicaraguas leftwing government has declared monthly unilateral 
ceasefires since the expiration of a temporary truce the two sides 
signed in march 1988 the truce was to lay the groundwork for a 
permanent peace but talks collapsed last september 
in february five central american presidents agreed to come up 
with a plan by midmay to disband the contras nicaragua in turn 
agreed to elections in february and to take other steps toward 
democratic reforms 
the message broadcast by radio liberacion quoted bermudez as 
saying the weapons of the freedom fighters constitute the only 
guarantee that the nicaraguan people have to pressure the 
sandinistas into fulfilling their promise of introducing democracy 
to nicaragua 
for that reason our troops will remain intact and alert but 
will not participate in actions of destruction or attacks against 
sandinista military positions 
we reaffirm our desire to achieve democracy and freedom for 
our country through peaceful means but we reaffirm also our 
decision to achieve these desires through weapons if the peaceful 
means fail 
bermudez reportedly left for miami on friday 
the rebel source also said juan ramon vivas romero known as 
commander quiche had temporarily stepped down as head of the 
contras chiefs of staff because of pain from an old combat wound 
the source said israel galeano known as commander franklin 
replaced vivas romero 
fighting in the 7yearold war has diminished to sporadic 
skirmishes since us military aid to the contras ended in february 
1988 
it is estimated that about 11000 rebels and members of their 
families are living in camps in honduras near the nicaraguan border 
the rebel source said bermudez told the contras about a 
bipartisan agreement between congress and the bush administration 
to provide about 45 million in nonmilitary aid to the rebels 
through february 1990

socialist mayor bernard sanders stepped 
down monday after running vermonts largest city for eight years 
and was succeeded by a political ally who shares his philosophy if 
not his label 
at an evening ceremony at city hall sanders relinquished his 
office to peter clavelle the former city director of community and 
economic development who was the candidate of sanders progressive 
coalition 
clavelle 39 won the office last month defeating the 
democratic candidate by a margin of 11 percent 
in his inaugural remarks clavelle called for radical changes 
in the relationship between state and local government 
burlington has had several tussles with the state legislature over 
homerule issues 
he also promised to continue sanders progressive platform 
saying it has made the city an example yes a small state and a 
small city can make a difference and give hope and aspiration 
to the whole country clavelle said 
a change in style is expected to be felt almost immediately 
clavelle who does not label himself a socialist favors a more 
pragmatic approach than the confrontational sanders 
clavelle developed a good rapport with business while serving as 
sanders development director those who worked with him said he 
was often the person who built and maintained working coalitions 
with business while sanders gave businessbashing speeches 
for his part clavelle says he and sanders are different people 
but share the same philosophy 
im no bernie sanders clavelle said our backgrounds are 
different our styles are different but our political visions are 
the same 
sanders who decided to step down to teach and write said 
clavelles election shows the progressive movement in burlington 
was and is much more than a oneman band

the strategic air command ordered the 
nations b1b bomber fleet back into the air nearly a week after a 
mechanical glitch was discovered in one plane an air force 
spokesman said 
all 97 planes were returned to active status in an order 
received by b1b bases sunday evening said lt col paul muehring 
chief of public affairs for mcconnell air force base in wichita 
where 16 of the bombers are based 
the order by gen john chain jr sac commanderinchief was 
based on inspections that began shortly after the planes were 
grounded last tuesday 
a strategic air command spokesman capt harry edwards of offutt 
air force base neb said two planes passed inspection and flew 
from mcconnell air force base monday but although some of the 
b1bs were again operating the order was not a blanket approval 
for the entire b1b fleet to return immediately to the air he said 
each aircraft will be returned to flying status upon 
completion of the inspection and correction of any deficiencies 
edwards said we do have some flying 
the grounding was a result of a problem discovered last monday 
during a preflight check of a b1b at dyess air force base in 
texas it was the third time the multimilliondollar planes have 
been grounded in the past 18 months 
the b1bs wings which can move from a forward position to a 
sweptback position did not appear to be working in 
synchronization with each other a mechanic disconnected a switch 
to investigate the problem but that disabled the mechanism that 
prevented the wing from going past the forward limit 
one wing moved a few inches too far forward and punctured a fuel 
tank muehring said 
after the problem developed 25 b1bs were spotchecked at six 
bases including two of mcconnells planes no problems were 
discovered muehring said 
a second order was issued later in the week to check all 97 
planes in the fleet muehring said and inspections continued 
through the weekend

police on monday called the slaying of an antidrug 
crusader a contract hit and said they are seeking three men who 
allegedly ordered the killing last month 
two men were arrested sunday on firstdegree murder charges for 
the shooting death of lee arthur lawrence the owner of a small 
grocery store who was unflagging in his efforts to rid his 
neighborhood of drugs 
lawrence 51 was killed in a fusillade of up to 30 bullets 
march 20 outside his store in perrine an impoverished community 
about 10 miles south of miami 
the two men arrested sunday were identified as ronnie johnson 
and rodney newsome both 21 in addition to the murder charges 
they face attempted murder counts for wounding two men who were in 
lawrences grocery store during the shooting 
fred taylor head of the metrodade police force said the 
amount of money and the motives for the crime could not be revealed 
immediately 
im afraid that some of the speculation will continue in the 
case until we know why and who and where the death was ordered 
from he said we feel we have those who did the shooting in 
this case 
information helping to break the case was phoned to a police tip 
line he said 
in addition to lawrences death johnson was charged with the 
midmarch killing of a reputed drug dealer in perrine and the 
attempted murder of a perrine man on march 5 police spokeswoman 
myriam royle said 
also on monday the county began tearing down crack houses only 
a few blocks from the site where lawrence was killed 
the neighbors are very happy that were taking these houses 
down because of the activities that go on at night said dade 
county commissioner larry hawkins they feel unsafe 
the parking lot next to lawrences store was the scene of 
frequent drug transactions and the market was the target of a 
failed firebombing attempt in 1987 a week before the shooting

began in late 1986

president bush opening a week of intensive 
talks on the middle east met with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
on monday and said a new atmosphere must be created between 
israel and arab nations as the first step toward peace 
after more than an hour of discussion bush urged an end to 
israels occupation of the west bank and the gaza endorsed the 
achievement of palestinian political rights and said a 
properly structured international peace conference could play a 
useful role 
the tone of bushs remarks suggested the united states may 
attempt to exert pressure for compromise on israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir who arrives in the united states on wednesday and 
confers with bush on thursday 
shamirs government has opposed any settlement based on trading 
land for peace and has been deeply skeptical about any 
international conference 
mubarak standing alongside bush at a departure ceremony in the 
rose garden said we found ourselves in agreement on most issues 
at stake 
in nicosia cyprus plo chairman yasser arafats chief adviser 
welcomed bushs call for a middle east peace conference and 
israels withdrawal from its occupied territories as an important 
and serious development 
bassam abu sharif told the associated press the palestine 
liberation organization feels this will give a real push for 
peace efforts in the middle east 
but in jerusalem shamir indicated that during his us visit he 
will state his opposition to bushs call for an end to israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and his endorsement of 
an international peace conference 
my position on all these issues is known ill have something 
to discuss with the leaders of the united states shamir said as 
he left for the united states we shall insist that negotiations 
be held within a reasonable framework and be conducted directly 
and without preconditions 
bush did not specify whether his administration was demanding 
total israeli withdrawal from the west bank and the gaza seized in 
the 1967 middle east war 
nor did he define what he meant by a properly structured 
international conference although a senior us officials said 
bush emphasized the key factor of direct negotiations in any 
peace process 
us policy on the occupied territories has been to urge israel 
to trade land for peace while leaving open the possibility of 
israel retaining some of the land for security reasons 
in his talks with bush mubarak rejected shamirs suggestion for 
elections among palestinians to find leaders who would negotiate 
their future with israel according to a senior us official 
mubarak said elections under israeli supervision were unacceptable 
to the palestinians the official added 
rather than let the idea drop bush asked mubarak if other forms 
of supervision would be acceptable the official said refusing to 
discuss the matter further or to be identified 
in a warm gesture of friendship after the formal talks at the 
white house bush took mubarak to baltimore for the opening day of 
the baseball season and a game between the orioles and the boston 
red sox bush left his guest briefly to throw out the first ball 
mubarak also will be the presidents guest at a white house 
dinner on tuesday night 
the 15month palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza and 
israels tough tactics in dealing with it have created pressure on 
the search for a peace settlement 
we share a sense of urgency to move toward a comprehensive 
settlement through direct negotiations bush said 
a new atmosphere must be created where israelis and arabs feel 
each others willingness to compromise so that both sides can 
win bush said 
violence can give way to dialogue once both sides understand 
that the dialogue will offer political gain he said egypt and 
the united states share the goals of security for israel the end 
of the occupation and achievement of palestinian political rights 
endorsing one of mubaraks principal proposals bush said that a 
properly structure international conference could play a useful 
role at an appropriate time 
mubarak wants a peace conference to be convened by the end of 
this year or the beginning of 1990 the official said the us 
position according to the senior us official is that theres 
a lot of ground that has to be covered before there could be a 
possible useful role for an international conference 
mubarak said he and bush shared the belief that any peace 
settlement should be a comprehensive one that addresses all 
aspects of the dispute particularly the palestinian problem 
that settlement should be achieved through direct negotiations 
between israel and all arab parties within the framework of the 
international peace conference the egyptian president said 
mubarak said that us talks with the palestine liberation 
organization represent one of the breakthroughs in the middle 
east moreover he said the plo has accepted unequivocally the 
requirements for peace 
an arab consensus has emerged in favor of preace and 
reconciliation and a majority of of the israeli people is 
shaping up in support of peace 
mubarak said in short the situation is right for an active 
effort more than ever before he said the united states remains 
highly qualified to play a pivotal role during the months ahead 
vice president dan quayle hosted a reception for mubarak at his 
residence on massachusetts avenue the egyptian president in a 
brief speech said peace would come easily to the middle east once 
negotiations began he invited quayle to visit the country 
later american businessmen gave a dinner for mubarak the 
egyptian leader said he was not asking the bush administration to 
put pressure on israel exerting pressure wont solve anything 
mubarak said 
he called the mideast peace conference he has been promoting a 
psychological umbrella that would not interfere with direct 
negotiations between israel and the arabs

the north atlantic treaty organization 
is facing a manpower shortage because of falling birth rates in its 
16 member nations 
one remedy officials here at nato headquarters say is the 
talks with the sovietled east bloc in vienna austria which could 
bring an accord on reducing troops and conventional arms in europe 
the us institute for defense analysis has forecast that by the 
year 2000 nato nations will see an average 124 percent drop in 
draftage males while there will be a 152 percent increase among 
the seven warsaw pact nations 
one reason is what the west germans call the pillenknick 
pill dip a falling birth rate due to greater use of the birth 
control pill in recent decades 
according to statistics supplied by the supreme headquarters 
allied powers europe the problem is most acute in west germany 
whose supply of draftage males will decline 45 percent from 1985 
to 2000 
in that same period the statistics indicated the netherlands 
will see a drop in males in the 18to24 age group of 30 percent 
followed by belgium 27 percent britain and luxembourg 25 percent 
each italy 23 percent denmark 17 percent france 13 percent 
and portugal 9 percent 
greeces supply of draftable males will remain even over the 
next decade only turkey expects an increase 
the us armed forces also face a declining manpower base 
in 1979 22 million americans were old enough to sign up for 
military service this fell to 19 million last year and will dip 
to 16 million by 1992 
to maintain adequate defenses nato is considering improving the 
combat role of reserve forces possibly by amending the way they 
are deployed in times of crisis 
the need to tap this potential has taken on a new urgency 
said gen john akehurst the deputy supreme allied commander in 
europe 
in wartime under present plans nato forces would include 5 
million people half of them reserves or volunteer citizensoldiers 
whose key wartime task would be to provide logistical support for 
combat troops 
the united states has begun strengthening its military reserves 
since 1980 their numbers have increased from 14 million to 17 
million 
west germany also has begun doubling the number of reservists 
for military excercises but with mixed results in 1985 a third 
of its reservists never showed up for their service 
reservists do not enjoy equal prestige in all allied nations 
and there are a variety of rules regarding their function 
the education and training periods are different the time a 
country is really going to use its reservists ie keep them 
trained and keep them on the list for active duty is different 
one nato official said 
as a result there is a large pool of reserves not trained 
to the extent required 
the increased use of reserves would offset the effect of falling 
birth rates but the graying of nato populations also will 
reduce the ranks of reserves 
this is already evident in west germany which has 16 million 
reservists but will have only 1 million by the mid1990s 
finding enough manpower poses special problems for the volunteer 
armed forces of britain the united states and canada which 
compete with private industry for a shrinking pool of personnel

east germanys aging communist leadership is under 
increasing pressure as disappointment grows over its refusal to 
follow mikhail s gorbachevs lead on economic and political 
reforms 
the soviet president has gained popularity in east germany 
particularly among young people who often are seen wearing i 
like gorbi buttons 
interviews and conversations across east germany during a recent 
twoweek period indicate that resentment is mounting and that even 
communist party officials have grown impatient and disillusioned 
with the governments rejection of gorbachevstyle reforms 
the senile old men are doing everything they can to stop the 
flood of new ideas from moscow said a 22yearold student at 
east berlins humboldt university 
the east german leader erich honecker is 76 years old and his 
politburo deputies also are in their 70s 
many east germans also are becoming increasingly frustrated with 
the governments continued hardline approach toward dissent the 
gap between the economic successes reported in the staterun media 
and the realities of the marketplace and severe restrictions on 
travel to the west 
on the berlinleipzig express one recent day east german 
passengers turned away from the window as the train passed the 
barbed wire gun towers and steel barriers at the berlin wall 
it is simply not possible emotionally to confront this 
division and isolation all the time said a 35yearold man 
you try not to think about it because it is an obscene symbol 
of your own powerlessness but you never really succeed its 
always there in your mind even when you dont see it 
according to west german government statistics none are made 
available in east germany at least 750000 people have applied to 
leave east germany in a rare public demonstration more than 600 
people protested recently in leipzig over the governments refusal 
to grant them exit visas 
exit visas are especially difficult for highly trained east 
germans such as doctors engineers and scientists 
i speak two foreign languages and it looks like ill never get 
out of the country to use them said a 27yearold east berlin 
engineering student 
we dont all want to leave if they would let me travel id 
come back this is my home 
the government has made clear it has no intention of taking the 
berlin wall down contending it protects east germany from 
plunderers and those aiming to disrupt stability and peace in 
europe 
this is ridiculous cynical cant said another east berlin 
student anyone with eyes can see that the binoculars and rifles 
are pointed east 
the government also has banned several soviet publications and 
films because of the growing public popularity of gorbachevs 
reforms 
lutheran church bulletins advocating a dialogue with the 
government over reforms have been censored and security authorities 
have cracked down on human rights groups 
while the partys leaders continue to insist that such reforms 
are unnecessary many lowerlevel party members intellectuals and 
workers insist that gorbachevs experiments should be tested 
gorbachevs policies which are known as glasnost and 
perestroika and call for openness and some decentralization in 
political and economic life have been hailed by dissidents as the 
first good thing to come from the soviet union in decades 
for many in the party leadership the changes are coming too 
fast said a party official in east berlin speaking only on 
condition of anonymity 
but many in the party ranks believe these ideas would prove 
useful 
government intransigence appears to be having an effect on party 
membership 
neues deutschland the communist partys newspaper reported in 
january that more than 3000 people had left or had been expelled 
from the party in east berlin over the past year 
stefan heym one of east germanys bestknown authors said 
gorbachevs changes in th soviet union appear to have caused a rift 
in the partys upper echelons 
there seem to be differing views about what should be done 
he said 
however one of the partys chief ideologues otto reinhold 
made it clear in a recent article in the staterun media that east 
germany has no plans to follow the soviet union and other warsaw 
pact allies with reforms any time soon 
there are those who believe that we have to change the way the 
economy is led to expand the market and to create competition 
reinhold said 
we on the other hand believe the best way is to build step by 
step on a system that has proven successful for us 
east germany has one of the most prosperous economies in the 
warsaw pact and its citizens enjoy among the highest standards of 
living in the region but the economy is slowing down and east 
germans complain of shortages 
theres a terrific new gas oven in my kitchen but no valve to 
connect it to the gas lines said a middleaged man from dresden 
ive been looking for this valve for four months 
owners of some of the private business establishments permitted 
say strict government regulations continue to hamper enterprises 
that can produce many goods and services that east german consumers 
want and are ready to pay more for 
at a popular private nightspot in leipzig the restaurants 
operator scanned the crowded tables and the line of people outside 
waiting to get in 
we are in a daily battle with the authorities just to keep 
going he said the system is designed to make it as difficult 
as possible to prosper

more than 5000 east germans have made it safely 
over the berlin wall since it went up in 1961 and 30058 others 
have fled into west germany at other border areas according to the 
august 13 group in west berlin 
but 189 people are known to have died while attempting to flee 
said horst schumm deputy director of the group which monitors 
human rights in east germany 
the lastest fatality at the berlin wall was a 22yearold man 
who was shot and killed by border guards feb 6 as he tried make it 
over the top with a ladder 
another east berlin man was killed recently when he fell to his 
death from the platform of his homemade hot air balloon on march 
10 east german border troops wounded one of three men during an 
escape attempt 
the economic and political situation in east germany has 
deteriorated considerably and many people have no hope that things 
will change or get better schumm said people are becoming 
more desperate 
east german leader erich honecker who supervised construction 
of the berlin wall after it was ordered built by communist party 
chief walter ulbricht in august 1961 said this past january that 
the wall will still be standing in 50 years and even in 100 years 
if the reasons for its existence are not set aside

live from washington its a new crop of dan 
quayle jokes as told by vice president dan quayle 
he poses no retaliatory threat to the tv comics who have made 
him the butt of their humor but quayle is polishing his style as a 
black and whitetie humorist 
mr president he said to george bush and 629 other people 
at a formal dinner saturday night youve been so supportive of 
me 
the other day he called me into the oval office and said i 
want to do something that will show the nation what faith i have in 
you in your maturity and your sense of responsibility 
would you like a puppy 
the quayle performances at the dinner of the gridiron club and 
earlier at the radio and television correspondents associations 
dinner are in keeping with the springtime rites of washington 
which include a round of formal dinners featuring the leaders of 
government needling journalists and themselves 
selfeffacing humor is deemed best and the higher the rank the 
bigger the laughs curiously that is doubly so if the official 
involved has been facing the kind of sharp sometimes personal 
criticism that has been quayles lot ever since he was nominated 
quayle made his debut as a humorist at the 45th radio and 
television correspondents dinner a couple of weeks ago reviews 
varied he was panned in the post 
but his delivery is improving as for the material thats a 
judgment that can only be made by the listenerviewerreader 
he opened that night by remarking on the cocktails and the wine 
at every table saying he realized most of you do not want to be 
secretary of defense the job john g tower was denied largely 
because of reports of excessive drinking 
that drew more groans than laughs although variations on the 
gag had been making the rounds since towers rejection by the 
senate it gets better quayle told his tough crowd 
quayle said some people expected that as vice president hed 
behave like spiro t agnew public enemy of the news media during 
the nixon administration until he resigned rather than face 
prosecution on bribery charges so he joked hed sought agnews 
advice on press relations this time around tell them no more 
mr nice guy he said agnew counseled 
gridiron dinners have been the setting for the repair of some 
political reputations and the denting of others nancy reagan sang 
second hand clothes early in the reagan administration and 
deflected criticism of her costly borrowed gowns and white house 
china 
in keeping with the ritual quayle turned his best lines on 
himself he said bush had offered him a new title to describe his 
duties funeral czar 
i think the president truly appreciates my insights he 
said just the other day he was telling the cabinet if theres 
one thing i wont tolerate its yes men 
isnt that right dan 
quayle looked down the head table at secretary of state james a 
baker iii i owe him so much he said during the campaign he 
took me under his wing 
and kept me there 
he said baker advised him on the way to handle the questions 
about his experience in the vice presidential campaign debate 
wait for a strategic moment then compare yourself to john 
kennedy 
thanks jimmy 
quayle said complaints about youth and inexperience didnt 
really bother him during the campaign what really burned me up 
were all the stories about my socalled handlers i finally got so 
mad i went right to the top i said marilyn youve got to do 
something about this 
marilyn of course is mrs quayle some of the vice presidents 
critics say shes the brains of the family 
ill never forget that magic moment we met quayle said 
you remember dear when you caught me peeking over your shoulder 
during the bar exam 
trying to outdo the hostile humor may seem a strange way to 
counter it but its worked before still theres a lot of mileage 
left in quayle jokes at the gridiron dinner ronald h brown the 
democratic chairman reminded everyone that washington now has an 
11 pm curfew for juveniles who do not have essential employment 
he turned to quayle

you might be able to get a fairly accurate view 
of whats ahead for the economy if you simply interview your 
friends or neighbors at the next social event you attend 
while it wont make you the life of the party and conceivably 
could kill it such interviews might provide you with a fair 
picture of future interest rates jobs inflation and even the 
gross national product 
you must accept whatever social consequences ensue but isnt 
that a fair enough price for a look into the mysterious future 
the suggestion arises from evidence that consumers en masse are 
pretty good at forecasting the economic future and even at making 
the proper moves in anticipation of developments 
consumers are so good at this in fact that the department of 
commerce recently announced the index of consumer expectations 
derived from studies at the university of michigan will be included 
among its leading or advance indicators 
while your informal survey will be informative it wont of 
course carry the authoritativeness of the michigan survey which 
is scientifically construed and professionally analyzed and has a 
track record dating to 1946 
in that time consumer expectations have foretold by weeks and 
months the movement of several significant economic measures there 
is no magic to it perhaps instinct plays a large role and 
selfconcern too 
consider these factors 
1 most consumers are not mere robots who automatically grab the 
lure of advertisers they do have minds and sometimes they use them 
2 when it concerns their own money most consumers have a high 
sense of fiduciary responsibility 
3 this a consumer economy consumers account for more getting 
and spending than business or government taken as a whole 
consumers are a vast economic power that can dictate economic 
changes when perceptions are acted out 
richard curtin director of michigans survey research center 
states that consumer expectations change on average two quarters 
in advance of movements in the prime interest rate three quarters 
in advance of changes in the jobless rate and one quarter in 
advance of changes in the consumer price index 
moreover he says the subjective assessments of consumers in 
regard to current business conditions usually are documented by the 
official statistics which arent released until weeks and months 
later 
in the latest reading of the consumer mind financial prospects 
for the year ahead were considered quite favorably the majority 
expected good times financially in the economy as a whole 
unemployment was expected to remain unchanged at its very low 
levels but a record number of consumers expected interest rates to 
rise inflation was foreseen averaging 48 percent or not much 
different from the existing rate 
you may if you choose conduct your own test among neighbors 
friends and relatives but a couple of caveats should be observed 
you should be aware that the larger the group the more 
representative it is likely to be individuals might be overly 
optimistic or pessimistic what is important is aggregate opinion 
and objective analysis of the results 
the second caveat is that should you actually attempt such a 
survey at a socialt you must assume full responsibility for 
the consequences

it is easier to see the presents failure 
than the pasts legendary elegance in what remains of the hotel 
bristol 
and it is hard for people of warsaw today to believe that the 
bristol will ever reopen its scaffolded facade and stripped 
interior having stood for so long as a nagging reminder of polands 
dismal economic slide 
even now as workers shoulder sacks of cement through its doors 
and decorators slip bits of pink brocade onto blueprints there is 
rampant skepticism that the communist government can carry off its 
grand plans to recapture the days when the pianist ignacy 
paderewski commanded a blocklong suite and tipsy guests tripped 
carefree through the garden fountain 
but governmentbacked renovators who have been at work 18 
months say will recreate a firstclass hotel on deadline sept 
25 1991 
it has been too long that this hotel has had its magnificence 
taken away said krzysztof wojcik director of the investment 
realization board of orbis the national tourism company 
the government has allotted 18 billion zlotys 315 million at 
the official exchange or 6 million at the black market rate for 
the bristol 
once among europes most elegant hotels with silver settings 
that included four pieces just for eating crayfish it was much in 
decline even from its postwar incarnation with a peoples 
tavern when it closed for renovations in 1980 
the martiallaw crackdown on the independent solidarity union 
movement in 1981 intervened western loans and investments were cut 
off and polands staggering economy had no room for the project 
about 15 million zlotys have been spent so far to pare the 
blocksquare eightstory hotel down to brick and beam and to begin 
to install new services 
although built at the turn of the century with all the modern 
techniques and conveniences of the time the difficulty of 
installing the technology of the 20th century into these old 
walls also has slowed the work said tadeusz jarecki a 
renovation coordinator 
just how sumptuous the bristol will be depends on the special 
team of designers charged with recapturing the viennese artnouveau 
style of its first decades and how much the elements imported from 
the west cost in precious hard currency 
we also hope that there will be some interest shown by 
investors on the american side said director wojcik we all 
know america rich and beautiful as it is lacks the historical 
monuments we have in europe 
renovators say they plan to restore the hotels marble stairs 
mirrors chandeliers furniture and even paderewskis piano 
design schemes call a grand entrance with a brass crest in a 
granite sidewalk the raspberry room restaurant will be recreated 
in pink and gilt and each floor of the 344bed hotel will be color 
coordinated down to the chambermaids uniform 
now however there are few walls no doors and much rubble in 
the courtyard where a glass conservatory once glittered are piles 
of pipes and boards dumped unceremoniously over the years in what 
one project director called a socialist hell 
built by paderewskis investment company the bristol flourished 
between the two world wars when he served briefly as premier 
the guest register was studded with notables from the world of 
diplomacy finance the arts and aristocracy hollywoods famous 
couple mary pickford and douglas fairbanks surveyed the 
treelined boulevard from their balcony in 1926 and the renovators 
hope their names and others will hang from a visiting card tree 
in the lobby of the new bristol 
the nazi occupiers took the hotel over during world war ii 
the bristol was one of the few buildings in the citys historic 
center still standing when the soviet red army entered warsaw in 
january 1945 
on josef v stalins birthday in 1949 the peoples tavern 
opened at the bristol and the russianpolish menu instructed 
customers that tipping offends the dignity of the working man 
orbis took over in 1952 redecorating and modernizing many 
dignitaries still took rooms including sen john f kennedy who 
needed a special bed board because of back problems during his 1959 
stay 
it remained the smartest hotel in warsaw through the 1960s but 
even the official history acknowledges that no repairs were made 
after 1952 and the bristol was being used as a dormitory for 
students when it closed 
to this day however the bristol is warmly remembered by many 
poles as a bright spot in an oftenbleak postwar period they 
recall animated debates around the cafes tables as students from 
nearby warsaw university and festive evenings out at the column 
room restaurant 
as with everyone living in warsaw i have personal memories 
said wojcik my sister was working in this hotel for 25 years 
until it was closed that is why i have a deep personal and 
professional conviction to have this hotel restored 
and so warsaw is waiting

editors note its another question of whether the feds should 
tell the states what to do and if so who should foot the bill 
this time the debate is about the quality of day care for children 
and when kids are involved emotions run high more than two dozen 
child care bills are now before congress while president bush has 
some ideas of his own 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

a baby sitter recently saved the lives of 
eight young children by tossing them from the window of her burning 
apartment to the arms of rescuers three stories below 
there was heroism in the tale but it also raised some questions 
should one person have been looking after eight children ranging 
in age from 5 months to 3 years were the children getting the 
individual attention considered vital to healthy child development 
even more basic was the situation safe and whos to blame for day 
care that is abusive hazardous emotionally damaging or 
intellectually barren 
day care for children traditionally has been regulated by the 
individual states now congress is debating whether to enact 
minimum federal standards and force states to toe the line 
no fewer than two dozen child care bills are pending on capitol 
hill with advocates of federal regulation insisting that some 
states simply are not doing a proper job 
the controversy over federal encroachment on the turf of the 
states was a major factor holding up child care legislation last 
year and the fireworks promise to be equally as lively this year 
are states doing the job 
arkansas gov bill clinton who is leading a national governors 
association push for federal incentives instead of requirements 
says the record reflects a significant effort in most states to 
improve child care standards 
but officials of the childrens defense fund maintain there are 
wide discrepancies in the standards from state to state in some 
states for example a single adult cannot care for more than three 
infants but in idaho a new mandatory licensing system 
theoretically permits one person to care for 12 infants 
the states that are generally moving forward are the ones that 
werent in such bad shape to begin with says helen blank day 
care director for the cdf but we still have a situation where in 
many states licensing standards dont give children the protection 
they need to grow up safe much less give them a good 
developmental experience 
the bottom line is that a few states have gone backwards in 
some states what they call progress makes you a little 
uncomfortable 
meanwhile president bush is pushing for a tax break for 
lowincome families with young children on the premise that it 
gives parents a choice one parent can decide to stay home or the 
family can use the money for the child care of their choice 
bushs plan presumes that parents dont want or need federal 
intrusion in the day care field any federal requirements would 
decrease the supply of care and infringe on parental choice 
backers of the plan contend 
but some parents have told congress they always assumed the 
government regulated child care until tragedy struck their family 
and experts contend that most parents arent qualified to judge day 
care and why should they have to 
we dont ask restaurant patrons to inspect the kitchen for 
violations says dr sue aronson a child care consultant who 
teaches pediatrics at hahneman university in philadelphia 
there is little disagreement among experts over ideal day care 
conditions for children some are physical such as requiring 
staffers to frequently wash their hands to prevent the spread of 
infectious disease providing immunizations fire extinguishers and 
enough adults on hand to get infants and young toddlers to safety 
in an emergency 
then there is quality warm positive individual onetoone 
interactions between adults and children as described by dr sue 
bredekamp director of professional development at the national 
association for the education of young children 
such interactions have a longterm effect on language 
selfesteem social development and intellectual competence she 
says her group has identified three factors that most influence 
the quality of day care interactions group size the 
stafftochild ratio and staff training 
bredekamp says proper training might have averted the recent 
death of a 9monthold infant whose nanny banged her head against 
the wall because she would not stop crying we must face the very 
real possibility that the nanny did not know any better she says 
training not only can prevent child abuse but also enables 
caregivers to help children grow and learn she says our goal 
is not that children just survive child care we want and need for 
them to thrive in child care 
to that end she says 20 preschoolers and two adults is far 
superior to 40 kids and four adults in terms of noise level 
psychological space and opportunities for individual interactions 
with adults and other children and she says one adult for every 
three or four infants is critical if babies are to be adequately 
held rocked comforted and protected from physical harm 
even states with relatively stringent regulations often fall 
short of standards recommended by professionals 
only 15 states meet naeyc guidelines for infant ratios and group 
size only five meet the guidelines for toddlers and 10 for 
preschoolers nearly half dont require any training or experience 
of day care teachers 
on the health and safety front about half the states dont have 
specific day care center handwashing requirements according to a 
forthcoming study by the american academy of pediatrics and the 
american public health association 
the federally funded study meant to be a comparative report 
card for states also has found that only 6 percent require that 
center children be immunized for meningitis and only 18 percent 
require energy absorbing surfaces below climbing equipment 
although onehalf to twothirds of all injuries occur on 
playgrounds

many state legislatures have agreed to some minimum standards 
but have balked at more stringent regulations urged by some 
agencies 
in idaho for example the state has just instituted a mandatory 
licensing system its first but while the new law requires fire 
and health inspections and criminal history checks it doesnt 
require any education or training of staff members the staffchild 
ratio is 1 to 12 regardless of the ages of the children staffers 
watching no more than six kids are not regulated at all 
the law is less strict than our regulations were under the 
previous law says perry ackerman child care licensing 
coordinator for the state but that was voluntary there wasnt 
any penalty for being unlicensed 
is that progress 
we lost a lot in the area of quality perry replies but 
we got a mandatory law after eight or nine attempts i guess its 
progress 
in texas regulations for the states 14000plus family day 
care homes are about to be revised under the current system the 
only qualification for caregivers is that they be 18 years old 
and they can watch up to 12 children depending on their ages one 
mix allows one adult to care for four infants and two toddlers 
another permits six young children and six schoolage siblings 
while texas requires centers to be licensed its much weaker 
registration system for day care homes was highlighted by toddler 
jessica mcclures wellpublicized tumble into an abandoned well 
shaft with six children in her care the baby sitter thought she 
didnt need to register with the state she was wrong 
but even if she had registered the state would have done no 
more than run checks for a criminal record or reports of child 
abuse no one would have visited the house and discovered the well 
shaft in the yard 
its providing a false sense of security to parents says 
cris rosdukler the states assistant commissioner for licensing 
rosdukler says she has unsuccessfully sought money to put teeth 
in the registration process an attempt two years ago to limit 
family day care homes to six children got nowhere she says 
hopes for change at this point turn on raising the minimum 
caregiver age to 21 and requiring training both before and after 
becoming a provider 
at the other end of the spectrum delaware upgraded family day 
care in 1985 and just completed an overhaul of center regulations 
the ratio now is one staffer to four infants health and safety 
requirements are much more stringent caregivers now must 
participate in 15 hours of training a year and expose children to a 
range of daily activities appropriate to their age 
what does delaware have that texas doesnt 
you really have to determine what is the community standard 
that is going to be acceptable says pauline koch delawares 
director of licensing services 
gwen morgan a professor at wheelock college in boston and 
author of the the national state of child care regulation 
doesnt agree that federal standards are the answer 
im amenable to one federal standard infant care she says 
im convinced that a one to seven infant ratio can have extremely 
harmful effects 
the dangers she says include borderline retardation from lack 
of stimulation increased spread of infectious disease and the 
sheer physical impossibility of exiting a building quickly with 
seven infants 
the federal government should otherwise stay out of the mandate 
business unless they are willing to fork over 20 billion to 30 
billion to help parents and states pay for the upgraded care 
morgan says 
the nations governors agree they are proposing the development 
of national model standards on everything from nutrition and safety 
to staff size training and parental involvement and seeking 
federal financial incentives for states to upgrade their systems 
if the states have incentive grants and after a few years you 
can show me people still doing things that are certifiably bad for 
kids then i personally will be glad to take another look at this 
federal standards issue clinton says 
model standards have failed to influence states in the past and 
hardliners hold little hope of progress even with a federal 
carrot in some states there is such strong opposition to making 
improvements that money incentives will not work says blank the 
childrens defense fund day care director 
blank and her allies note that the states must meet a variety of 
conditions to get federal money for head start school lunches 
nursing homes highways and antipollution projects so why not day 
care 
taxpayers do not want their tax dollars used to place babies 
and children in dangerous situations says joyce strom deputy 
director of the child welfare league of america 
but clinton says mandatory child care standards would be like 
mandatory elementary school standards we have smaller class 
requirements now in arkansas he says its very expensive 
its very controversial and its very good for atrisk kids im 
glad we did it but i wouldnt recommend it as a national 
standard 
the debate at the clinton household half a continent away from 
the talk on capitol hill has a familiar ring for while clinton 
has been designated lead governor in the nga bid to discourage 
mandated national standards his wife hillary is chairman of the 
childrens defense fund the fiercest standards champion of all 
if it was just the two of us i think we could work it out 
clinton said with a laugh but its not

since the early days of the vietnam war most daily headlines 
and leading items on the tv evening news have involved moral as 
well as legal choices the pentagon papers the watergate breakin 
the village of my lai pulling the plug on karen ann quinlan lust 
and greed among tv evangelists oliver north hero or villain 
lt col north argues he lied to congress to serve a higher 
good socrates defied the law in refusing to finger fellow 
athenians opposed to the rule of the 30 tyrants from jail cells 
henry thoreau and martin luther king urged disobedience to unjust 
laws jeb magruder said his role model for breaking the law in the 
watergate affair was his old ethics teacher at yale the rev 
william sloane coffin who recommended that students burn their 
draft cards shut down the city of washington 
on house calls to industry ethicist newton shies from the 
designation philosopher thats someone who stands around the 
water cooler all day she says a cartoon on her office door 
comes closer to describing the role of the ethicist in industry a 
harried executive is pushing a button on the intercom and intoning 
miss wattles will you send someone in who knows right from 
wrong 
lately leaders in the fields of government medicine law 
engineering computers journalism have been pushing the button for 
an expert consultant to help write some ethical guidelines or deal 
with cases of misconduct 
a recent example of job opportunities for a latterday socrates 
is the nationwide search conducted by floridas poynter institute 
for a theologian or philosopher to head up its ethics center three 
other branches of this highly respected institute concentrate on 
improving skills and standards of working journalists in writing 
graphics and management 
we believe people at every level can be trained to think about 
ethical dilemmas says institute president robert haiman so 
when that big call comes up at 1040 and youre going to press at 
11 you have a more orderly way to approach it 
a lot of these ethical calls have to be made by street 
reporters were talking about reportorial behavior is it ok to 
read upside down on somebodys desk is it ok to open a guys file 
cabinet while hes out of the office is it ok to lie about who you 
are to pretend youre an ambulance attendant or whatever 
some at the top of the executive ladder argue that ethics 
training should begin at the very bottom long before college or 
professional school 
if an mba candidate doesnt know the difference between 
honesty and crime between lying and telling the truth wrote ibm 
chairman john akers in a recent issue of the sloane management 
review then business school in all probability will not 
produce a convert 
akers finds it ludicrous that even divinity schools and law 
schools and departments of philosophy have to pay proctors to pad 
up and down the aisles at examination time to make sure nobody is 
looking at crib notes or copying from a neighbor 
an increasing number of fortune 500 companies and countless 
smaller firms are calling in experts to help draft a formal code of 
ethics 
chemical banks code of ethics which must be read and 
signed by all its 30000 employees worldwide is among the most 
widely copied to translate the code into an operating 
philosophy more than 250 vice presidents have undergone a 
twoday seminar on decision making and corporate values 
presided over by the banks chairman 
the code is credited with chemicals decision to create a 
special lending unit for minority businesses and its refusal to 
finance arms exporters and corporate raiders or do business with 
pornographers massage parlors and several countries run by 
dictators 
chief executive officer james burke calls johnson and johnsons 
credo which dates back to 1945 the glue that held the 
health care multinational together during two nightmare tylenol 
poisoning incidents and played the most important role in 
withdrawing the capsules 
the credo also dictated managements decision to stop 
advertising their baby oil as a tanning lotion after medical 
evidence showed the product speeded up the suns harming effects on 
the skin sales immediately plunged from 10 million to 5 million 
but again the firm bounced back 
why are ethics suddenly hot now 
in the wake of the scandals in wall street chicagos commodity 
market and defense contracts there is an awareness that the 
company which acts responsibly can avoid fines and jail sentences 
reduce court suits that entail costly legal and accounting fees 
diminish the threat of more government regulation increase company 
morale and attract a higher type more loyal employee 
there is a growing conviction that strong corporate culture 
and ethics are a vital strategic key to survival and profitability 
in a highly competitive era concludes the business roundtable a 
public issues forum for some 200 top chief executive officers 
after an indepth study of the corporate ethics of 10 leading 
firms including boeing chemical bank general mills and xerox 
a few weeks ago new yorks harvard club witnessed an unlikely 
gathering of theologians philosophers and wall street brokers and 
analysts to launch ethics in the financial marketplace by john 
casey managing director of the investment firm scudder stevens 
and clark 
when casey a disciple of chuck powers sat down at his apple ii 
word processor to write a howto guide to responsible business 
behavior friends on wall street joked that it would be one of 
the shortest books ever written 
the rev langan who never disguises the fact he is a jesuit 
priest when going into a firm notes that the yuppie philosophy of

editors note more than onethird of the estimated 122000 
roman catholic nuns and monks in the united states are now over age 
70 while fewer and fewer young women and men are entering convents 
and monasteries to support them there are serious deficits in the 
orders retirement budgets but the nuns are not afraid of being 
put out on the streets because as one sister in michigan says 
we care for one another

for 53 years sister alice trese labored 
in the lords vineyard as a college registrar and social worker for 
the sisters of st joseph 
now 89 sister alice spends her days in the orders retirement 
home a wing on the convent she entered as a young woman in 1929 
i cant get used to the idea i cant do what i used to do 
says sister alice who worked as a receptionist and in the orders 
laundry even after retiring seven years ago i cant get used to 
the idea of failing health 
now sister alice and her retired friends attend mass every day 
say their rosaries and root for the detroit tigers just like they 
have since their younger days 
these frail women of god are part of an aging breed of roman 
catholic nuns and monks moving into retirement while fewer and 
fewer young women and men are entering convents and monasteries to 
support them 
the result is a fiscal nightmare that has left an estimated 3 
billion deficit in retirement budgets across the country says 
sister mary oliver hudon 
she is director of a retirement project of the national 
conference of catholic bishops conference of major superiors of 
men and the leadership conference of women religious 
nearly 36 percent of the estimated 122000 nuns and monks in the 
united states are over age 70 and less than 1 percent are under 30 
she says 
the base that can support the older religious nuns and monks 
has just been eroded away she said 
few orders stashed money away for retirement in part because 
nuns worked for low wages and because they preferred to spend the 
money building hospitals or adding services sister mary oliver 
says 
they made that choice on the assumption that when people were 
no longer active they died she says it sounds terrible but 
i dont think anybody foresaw the social changes that led to 
longer life spans and far fewer people entering religious life 
diocesan priests who arent members of religious orders 
werent included in the retirement project she says their 
pensions are funded by all the churches in the diocese for which 
they worked rather than a single order 
the sisters of st joseph mirror the national picture with 220 
of their 455 members retired says sister betty veenhuis president 
of the congregation 
the order founded 100 years ago by nuns from new york who came 
west to staff borgess hospital in kalamazoo once had 950 members 
working in hospitals nursing homes orphanages and catholic 
schools across southern michigan 
thirty years ago sister betty says as many as 50 young women 
would have been preparing to enter the convent which comprises the 
spot on the map called nazareth 
now it has only 18 women under 40 and just one woman in her 
40s preparing for admission she says at the other end of the 
spectrum 13 are over 90 
sister betty says mergers with other orders could bolster the 
sisters ranks in the future as could discussions with a group of 
about 100 lay people in the kalamazoo area who want to be 
affiliated in some way with the sisters of st joseph 
like many orders the sisters of st joseph joined social 
security in 1971 when the law was changed to permit nuns and monks 
to make back payments and enter the system 
sister emily simons treasurer of the order says social 
security provides just 2000 of the 10000 annual cost of caring 
for a retired member the rest comes from the earnings of younger 
sisters who take vows of poverty and turn their earnings over to 
the order 
but sister betty says that isnt enough and this year the order 
will need to tap the interest on a retirement fund that it has been 
paying into since 1971 
sister emily says the congregations assets including its 
members earnings social security retirement fund and the 
proceeds from selling all its property except the motherhouse 
would be 45 percent short of the amount needed to care for the 
current members until their death 
she estimates the deficit to be in the millions of dollars but 
declines to be more specific 
the sisters know of the looming financial crisis and try to cut 
corners sister betty says 
i dont think they at all fear that were going to run out of 
money and that theyre going to be on the street she says 
it simply calls us to good stewardship and good planning and 
good use of our resources over the next five or 10 years 
sister mary oliver says some orders try to sell off their land 
and buildings but often cant find buyers for their aging 
facilities 
despite the growing problem she says most orders still can pay 
their bills 
there is not a sister or brother i know of who is starving or 
not getting medical care she says the crunch is going to come 
in five to 10 years 
sister betty is putting her faith in oldfashioned christian 
charity and a committee that advises the order on investment 
decisions 
in december michigan catholics contributed more than 145 
million to a new fund set up to bail out religious orders says 
sister monica kostelmy of the michigan catholic conference 
final figures arent in but sister mary oliver expects more 
than 20 million will be collected nationwide in the first of 10 
annual appeals 
the funds will go first to desperate orders such as one with 17 
of its 18 members over 70 and then be divided among the others 
retirement funds she says 
sister betty says the sisters of st joseph will stick together 
rather than going back to their families or elsewhere for care in 
their twilight years 
we care for one another she says

editors note shes the buffer between the people and the 
communistrun bureaucracy in troubled poland a country where the 
average wait for an apartment is 15 years 13 years for a 
telephone in her first year as the governments ombudsman ewa 
letowska has received 55000 complaints far surpassing the cases 
handled by her counterparts in the west 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ewa letowska the first and only 
government ombudsman in the east bloc likes to tell the tale of 
two frogs who fell into a vat of milk one drowned but the other 
kept swimming until he churned butter and climbed out 
shes been swimming hard for a year now 
when mrs letowska opened polands ombudsmans office in january 
1988 she had 1800 letters on her desk and 18 people waiting in 
line and the deluge hasnt subsided she has received 55000 
cases an absolute world record and many times the number 
facing her 40 or so counterparts in the west 
why have so many poles turned to her for help 
frustration is mrs letowskas explanation 
the polish parliament created the ombudsmans office in july 
1987 as part of legal reforms aimed at curbing abuse by the 
communistrun bureaucracy and making government agencies more 
accountable 
the law allows the ombudsman to operate independently during her 
fouryear term with immunity from prosecution she can demand 
information from officials for her investigations except in cases 
involving the military national security or state secrets and 
file administrative or court appeals 
it took an extensive search to find an ombudsman acceptable to 
the government while independent enough not to be dismissed 
outofhand by the opposition led by the solidarity union 
mrs letowska an exuberant erudite 48yearold expert on civil 
law and consumer rights started work on jan 4 1988 with no 
staff no equipment and no methodology 
the first day of the ombudsmans work opened a great stream of 
complaints against everything and everybody and after one month 
another wave this time of curses and abuses from people who didnt 
receive answers she told the parliament in her first annual 
report 
there is plenty for poles to complain about from 15year waits 
for housing to the seemingly inconquerable mazes of forms stamps 
and arrangements required for many transactions 
mrs letowska says the volume of cases forces her to look for 
groups representing typical repeatable mistakes of the legal 
system and functioning of the state violating peoples rights and 
freedoms 
for example she took on numerous cases concerning warsaw 
landowners still not compensated as promised for properties 
nationalized after world war ii parliament now has ordered the 
claims be resolved 
mrs letowska who is also host of a radio program on opera with 
her lawyer husband discusses her work in a newspaper column and on 
a television show she recently delivered a lecture at the european 
law center in london 
she has compared notes with the other ombudsmen in the west and 
nonaligned yugoslavia and found the only difference is the 
number of cases and maybe the expectations because people there 
probably dont want apartments from them since they have them 
already 
mrs letowska says she looks at the legal issues in a case not 
the political issues 
as she puts it i dont deal with political prisoners i deal 
with toilets in prisons if there are cleaner toilets both 
political prisoners and nonpolitical prisoners will benefit 
this legalistic path can be hard to follow in politicized 
poland the head of the solidarity commission monitoring human 
rights faults mrs letowska for a reluctance to take on political 
cases or drastic cases of corruption but he directs most of his 
criticism at the system itself 
the ombudsmans office is an institution that is in a rather 
hopeless situation says zbigniew romaszewski the legal system 
of this country is simply broken and there is general anarchy the 
authorities have used the law completely as an instrument and 
destroyed it in this way 
mrs letowska who describes herself as a lawyer from head to 
toe not a bureaucrat also is disturbed by the degree of 
distrust for the government bureaucracy that decides pensions and 
the like 
but she adds its not that everything is being regulated 
from the top there is the law 
in a country where the average wait to get a telephone is 13 
years mrs letowska ruled recently that telephone workers should 
not have priority for obtaining phone service as had been provided 
by a special regulation such privileges she said give rise to 
a sense of social injustice 
yet she does not argue against special shops for miners and free 
electricity for power workers when institutionalized as laws 
there is a fundamental difference between legal acts granting 
privileges to specific professional groups of special significance 
to the national economy and privileges usurped byinternal 
regulations she wrote 
during her first year mrs letowska organized doctors to handle 
prison health complaints filed nine appeals to polands supreme 
court looked into complaints that letters from the west are held 
up or damaged by the post office and took up the causes among 
many others of a prisoner trying to get information about her 
children at an orphanage a woman denounced by a soninlaw trying 
to get her apartment and the widow of an officer executed during 
the stalinist period 
there are 55 lawyers and office workers handling the cases but 
no computer three guards keep a list of waiting clients and two 
aides screen for emergency cases 
about 23 percent of the complaints filed with the ombudsman 
concern the justice system and about the same percentage involve 
social welfare problems such as pensions and insurance 
seventeen percent have to do with housing 12 percent with 
property disputes another 12 percent concern financial matters and 
3 percent with education cultural and health service problems 
about 10 percent of her cases concern civil rights but mrs 
letowska says surprisingly few are purely political 
there is a general picture in the west that people are 
repressed or fired from their jobs for their views she says 
while thats often true she says sometimes politics has nothing 
to do with the firing 
she cites as an example an engineer at a towns only factory who 
has a fight with his boss 
the guy will say they are harassing me because of political 
reasons and there are no politics in the whole case 
i cannot convince those people they are not being repressed 
for their views but for everything in general such cases wouldnt 
see daylight in the west

editors note hes been called the wizard of weston a 
professional inventor who doesnt believe in wasting his time on 
products that wont sell but one of the problems inventors have 
says stanley mason is selling their ideas to the companies that 
employ them to help remedy that hes teaching a course on 
creativity to a group of graduate business students 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
inventor stanley mason who lays claim to 
the worlds first microwave cookware the squeezable ketchup bottle 
and the granola bar among other things says hes seen a lot of 
milliondollar ideas get lost because of a lack of vision in 
corporate america 
like the disposable diaper he designed and the company ignored 
mason whos been called the wizard of weston hopes to do 
his part to remedy that shortsightedness with a course on 
creativity hes teaching to graduate business students at the 
university of connecticuts stamford campus 
the whitehaired 67yearold inventor has a laboratory in a 
twostory barn where elaborate and secret experiments are in 
progress there are blackboards and long conference tables for 
brainstorming sessions 
mason isnt trying to turn his students into thomas edisons but 
he does think he can impart some of his curiosity and ability to 
think creatively which he credits for the 30 patents he holds 
in large companies people are divided up into departments 
that are so insular they dont understand what goes on in the next 
office mason said during a recent interview at simco inc the 
product development company he founded in 1973 after a corporate 
career that included stints with hunt foods inc the glenn l 
martin co armstrong cork co inc american can co and us 
steel corp 
they dont understand the totality the continuum the 
interaction between products and consumer its possible with 
patience to teach people how to think in a creative way how to 
take a tentative point of view about everything how not to be so 
damn sure about everything 
norman c parrish of moraga calif president of the national 
congress of inventor organizations calls mason one of the most 
widely respected inventors in america 
masons work he says is valuable enough that johnson amp 
johnson and companies of that caliber give him essentially open 
contracts to come up with new products for them 
most people make the mistake of thinking that being an inventor 
simply means dreaming up a great idea mason says but the 
successful inventor is someone who recognizes the market for a 
product that doesnt yet exist and figures out how to provide it 
edisons greatest invention was not the electric light or the 
phonograph he says his greatest invention was the product 
development laboratory 
edison was a real psychologist he knew what could sell he 
didnt invent things that couldnt sell he didnt waste his time 
masons 15week course consists of a series of threehour 
seminars that include lectures by successful entrepreneurs and 
exercises designed to stretch the students minds 
for one recent assignment he sent students into a norwalk store 
and told them to pick out a product that they as consumers thought 
needed improvement they returned to the classroom divided up into 
three companies and spent the rest of the night playing ideas off 
each other 
it sort of frees ones way of thinking says david chang a 
research chemist at clairol inc who is working toward his masters 
in business administration it will be very very helpful to 
people in technical management 
mason has experienced the frustrations of corporate life 
firsthand 
in the 1970s when he developed masonware which he says was the 
first cookware for microwaves mason was told by a major american 
corporation there was no market for it today such cookware is a 
350 millionayear business he says 
when he developed the granola bar as an alternative snack 
product for nestle s a in the 1970s the company decided it wasnt 
interested quaker oats co and others eventually came out with 
their own 
then there was the disposable diaper debacle mason was 
exasperated trying to put a square diaper on his sons round bottom 
not to mention the drudgery of laundry and those painful pricks 
from safety pins 
so when he was working for a major paperproducts company he 
designed a disposable diaper lined with soft absorbent paper 
shaped like an hourglass to fit a babys bottom and substituted 
sticky tape for pins 
the company patented the invention and mason got 100 for his 
efforts the company which he didnt want to be identified sold 
the patent rights to another corporation which also failed to act 
on the idea 
since then shaped disposable diapers have become a 
billiondollar product line 
such lack of vision helps explain why half the patents issued in 
america last year went to inventors outside the country mason says 
product development is a risky business he says theres 
no security in working in product development in any us company 
because if the product doesnt work they kill the messenger 
according to one survey the average tenure for research 
directors at american corporations is only 13 or 14 months mason 
says 
ive worked for lots of companies ive been fired from lots 
of companies he says 
today simcos clients include 40 fortune 500 companies such as 
johnson amp johnson kimberlyclark corp proctor amp gamble co 
huntwesson foods inc and primerica corp 
it has a fulltime staff of about eight employees plus about 
125 associates mostly academics who provide creative input on 
various projects such as masons latest venture how to get 
petroleum substitutes including fuel from chinese tallow trees 
that project has been funded in part by the national science 
foundation the us department of agriculture and the state of 
hawaii 
among his other inventions the first plastic underwire bra for 
playtex a superstrong velcro for velcro fastening systems a 
burglar alarm that hangs on a doorknob and square milk jugs that 
save shipping space 
mason dates his first invention to his youth when he sold a 
slingshotlike weapon to scores of friends his inventive spirit 
was nurtured by his father an electrician who developed the first 
electric chair for the state of new jersey mason says 
his first real job was as a teenager at the trenton free public 
library which also served as one of 12 regional depositories for 
patents issued by the us patent office hed spend hours poring 
over other peoples inventions and realized thats what he wanted 
to do with his life 
part of what i do is feed my unconscious and conscious brain 
with lots of things he says its furniture you move around in 
your head and the more that you have there the more connections 
take place

editors note when hollywood producers take their cameras to 
nevada as they are doing more and more these days they rely on a 
former new york model to pave the way and round up a cast of 
extras shes christine orourke who operates the only movie 
location management company in the state 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it takes a lot of chutzpah to close down 
a busy section of interstate 15 orchestrate a simulated shootout 
in a crowded airport lobby or fake the firebombing of a casino on 
the las vegas strip 
but for a former new york model such challenges have become 
routine 
christine orourke who saw dreams of a modeling career derailed 
19 years ago now runs the only licensed movie casting and location 
management company in nevada 
in that role she finds her ingenuity tested almost daily by 
hollywood producers taking part in the production of films such as 
rain man which won the oscar as the best picture of 1988 
midnight run heat starman and the television series 
crime story 
her toughest assignment was setting up a scene in which a casino 
was firebombed a near impossible feat in a city where gaming 
executives are skittish about even having photographs taken in 
their establishments 
the firebombing was shot for one of the episodes of the tv 
series crime story 
we had to clear everything through security deal with fire 
codes get clearance of city and county officials etc orourke 
recalls sitting in an office lined with autographed photos of 
stars with whom shes worked we had to practice the scene then 
shut down the entire casino operation to make it work 
another scene involved tossing a molotov cocktail in a 
restaurant 
it takes a lot of finesse to get an owner to let you do 
something like that she says laughing 
she found herself enlisting the aid of the governors office in 
closing a section of i15 the main artery between las vegas and 
los angeles to film a scene for starman 
on other occasions has cleared a mountain of legal and public 
relations problems to close down sections of the las vegas strip 
and downtowns glitter gulch 
youve got to get the approval of every casino owner whos 
affected she explains youve got to go to all the property 
owners even the guy who runs the hot dog stand and the owner of 
the pawnshop if just one of them says no its my job to convince 
them it would be good for them 
orourke handled the nevada locations and casting of extras for 
rain man 
but she found midnight run one of her toughest challenges 
especially a scene filmed at mccarran international airport in las 
vegas 
these people were sticklers for realism she recalls they 
wanted real cops real fbi agents they said if you cant get us 
real cops and fbi men well find someone who can 
orourke found herself calling powerful clark county sheriff 
john moran in the predawn hours one day to enlist his aid in the 
search for extras she delivered and the airport scene involving 
400 extras was one of the more dramatic segments of the hit film 
the airport scene was not without its problems 
she blocked off the ticketing counters at the busy facility 
filming overnight when traffic was lightest 
we had signs up to indicate we were filming but it still 
caused a scene when someone shouted look out hes got a gun 
and everyone started pulling guns she says 
martin sheen needed soldiers in his upcoming movie 
nightbreaker the extras were to portray american servicemen 
used in atmospheric nuclear testing at the nevada test site in the 
1950s veterans have contended they were subjected to radioactive 
fallout from the testing a charge denied by the government 
the sensitive nature of the film ruled out government agencies 
as a source for the extras so orourke recruited high school and 
college rotc students to provide the needed manpower 
she enlisted the aid of the principal at her childrens 
elementary school when a producer wanted two eskimo kids a 
russianlooking youngster and a 10yearold mr t lookalike 
the heady world of hollywood was something of a natural 
progression for orourke 38 who began modeling in her hometown of 
san jose calif at the age of 15 she headed for new york city two 
years later modeling for magazines such as seventeen 
that career came to a halt when she married at the age of 19 a 
divorce then a move to las vegas nine years ago found her 
searching for a new career while trying to support her children 
patrick 13 and tara 12 
she started spectrum services her location and casting company 
on less than 100 
the use of nevada locations in filming motion pictures is 
growing annually with direct film revenues to the state topping 
50 million last year 10 times the revenues generated five years 
ago 
much of nevadas recent success in wooing hollywood producers 
can be attributed to robert hirsch and his state motion picture 
division 
las vegas offers many attractive features for filmmakers 
orourke says 
this is a 24hour town she says you can film anytime of 
the day or night theres a lot of lore and history its an 
attractive area 
and nevada is something of a last frontier its the last 
state where you can come in and do a tremendous amount of things 
without a lot of red tape

for a celebration of former chancellor helmut schmidts 70th 
birthday 
ustinov lives in switzerland and paris with his frenchborn 
wife helene 
this was ustinovs second offer to play the role of detective 
fixx the first came in 1956 when mike todd made his version of the 
jules verne novel about an english gentleman who bets his entire 
fortune that he can circle the earth in 80 days fixx chases after 
fogg in the mistaken belief that he has robbed the bank of england 
mike todd asked me to do it ustinov recalls but i had a 
contract with 20th century fox which had money invested in 
cinemascope and didnt want todd to succeed with his toddao 
widescreen process they wanted me to play van johnsons sidekick 
in 23 paces to baker street i got out of that but still 
couldnt do around the world now 30 years later i have the 
satisfaction 
his present role came about when he was offered a cameo in the 
miniseries 
however much they tempt you with money he says its very 
unsatisfying to go off having tasted food and not being able to 
swallow then they suggested another cameo i said i just didnt 
like cameos 
then they said how about fixx i said that was possible with 
fixx i had my revenge on all the sergeants in the army hes very 
much like sergeants plebian shrewd stupid everything mixed 
ustinov a private in the british army in world war ii said he 
made detective fixx into a touching figure 
hes an idealist ustinov says hes in love with a very 
unlovely woman in times of stress he consults her picture in the 
end he marries her 
ustinovs work on around the world in 80 days added to his 
reputation as a world traveler he filmed in macao bangkok hong 
kong san francisco liverpool and yugoslavia 
we filmed on a plain east of belgrade for china he says 
i wondered where they were going to get all the chinese needed 
for the scenes even if we raided all the chinese restaurants i 
didnt think wed find enough people but they showed up i said 
where did they all come from i was told they were in yugoslavia to 
study serbian 
the threepart series also stars eric idle as passepartout and 
julia nickson as princess aouda 
after he completed work on the miniseries ustinov immediately 
went to work on an italian movie called the paradise of dogs 
i played a veterinarian who drinks he says its a comedy 
and they said its like disney i said its not like disney its 
italian its a rather charming observation of people and animals 
he drinks to get rid of his inhibitions so he can communicate 
better with the animals that itself is very italian 
ustinov will also appear in a french miniseries commemorating 
the bicentennial of the french revolution he plays mirabeau in the 
show which also stars jane seymour and klaus maria brandau 
on feb 1 ustinov was inducted into the french academy of fine 
arts filling the vacancy created by the death of orson welles his 
sword was made by his son a sculptor and youngest daughter a 
jeweler 
ustinov who won his oscars for spartacus and topkapi 
is also wellknown for playing another detective hercule poirot 
he played the agatha christie creation in three feature films and 
three television movies 
poirot did nothing but ask questions and ask them in an 
interesting way ustinov says it can be exhausting only in 
the last 10 minutes do you have the luxury of expanding and 
explaining why everything happened as it did 
agatha christie was jealous of her creation despite all her 
other work publishers kept asking for more poirot stories she 
treated it as an attempt to take over her authority she finally 
wrote a story killing him off and put it away when she became ill 
her daughter authorized its publication 
she had the pleasure of killing off poirot a few days before 
she went herself

musicals that flop out of town rarely are 
resurrected on broadway one exception is chu chem which 
folded in philadelphia in 1966 and now has found a new life nearly 
23 years later at new yorks ritz theater 
its the longest workinprogress in the history of 
broadway jokes mitch leigh the man who wrote the music for this 
show about a jewish community in 16thcentury china leigh also is 
coproducer of the latest and he hopes final version 
chu chem was never finished in philadelphia leigh says 
we knew what was wrong we just never rewrote it 
for its four creators and especially leigh the new chu chem 
is more than a revival it is a tying up of loose ends a 
completion of tasks left undone 
it all started when i was approaching my 60th birthday the 
61yearold leigh says i was thinking about what i hadnt done 
in my life that i wanted to do one thing was to play my music in a 
jazz band which i eventually did at the metropolitan museum of art 
last year the other was chu chem 
the idea for the show originated with ted allan a canadian 
actor and writer who first thought about chu chem more than 30 
years ago during a visit to china 
i discovered that there were still people in a town called 
kaifeng who called themselves hebrews he recalls then i began 
to match my knowledge of talmudic folk tales with what i was 
discovering about chinese folk tales they were similar 
what allan learned eventually evolved into the book of chu 
chem the story of the search by an old man and his family for a 
lost tribe of jews in china 
i wrote it for zero mostel the author says but zero 
turned it down and went into something called fiddler on the 
roof 
but mostel showed the script to director albert marre who 
brought in leigh chu chem was on its way at least as far as 
philadelphia the show which starred menasha skulnik as the aging 
patriarch and molly picon as his wife died there the victim of 
poor reviews and the departure of miss picon who left the cast even 
before opening night 
in philadelphia we were guilty of overkill says colyricist 
jim haines the story got subverted its poignancy its humor 
its simple beauty and what it was trying to say were lost 
leigh agrees he and marre felt that lurking in the flop show 
was a marvelous musical but work on it didnt resume until the 
middle of 1986 when the director and composer got together with 
allan soon haines and colyricist jack wohl got involved again 
getting the collaborators together wasnt easy leigh the 
composer of man of la mancha and producer of yul brynners last 
marathon tour of the king and i lives in new york allan 
resides in toronto wohl lives in los angeles while haines makes 
his home in south africa 
i stopped getting bills from the telephone company i got 
thankyou notes wohl says it was difficult for us to get 
together but when we did it was very rewarding 
let me put it another way says leigh its very difficult 
to argue under those circumstances 
allan eliminated the mother from the tale so the plot could 
focus on the relationship between the father and his outspoken 
daughter as well as a love story between the daughter and a chinese 
prince leigh added four new melodies while wohl and haines 
rewrote 80 percent of the lyrics 
once we had agreed to do this rewrite we all felt very secure 
having mitch around allan says we felt secure because he not 
only wrote good music but we knew he had a lot of experience 
producing shows i sensed that if we came up with something good 
mitch would get it on 
basically its a new play but we held onto the old title 
because we were all in love with it allan says i saw it 
always for what it was meaning that if it were done its a 
fable its a fairy tale 
the new incarnation of chu chem was first done last december 
at the jewish repertory theater a tiny playhouse on 14th street 
the purpose of the production downtown was to get chu chem 
on its feet so people could hear it wohl says and they liked 
what they heard the show created enough boxoffice interest that 
it could have run for two years at the 99seat theater 
the discipline imposed on the collaborators at jrt forced us 
to keep the shows simplicity intact haines says what emerged 
was a simple beautiful poignant piece of work 
the reviews also were positive encouraging leigh and 
coproducer william rollnick to move the musical to broadway and 
the ritz leigh knows he is taking a chance with a modest musical 
with a cast of unknown performers headed by mark zeller and emily 
zacharias by subjecting it to the harsh light and economics of 
broadway 
but he believes good wordofmouth and cheaperthanusual 
tickets priced under 40 will bring in theatergoers even if it 
doesnt leigh believes he has been paid back 
the resurrection of chu chem was my interest he says 
the fact that it occurred means i already have been paid off it 
will now exist for all time as a musical and thats enough for 
me

dozens of times every day in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip israeli soldiers face young palestinians 
throwing stones anger builds steadily in many of the soldiers 
reserves called up from civilian life and the order comes to 
drive them off then comes the guilt the guilt that some of the 
israelis will carry with them perhaps for life an associated press 
correspondent talked to israeli veterans of the arab uprising in 
the occupied territories this is her report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in hot pursuit of a stone thrower an israeli 
lieutenant charged into an arab home and and began bashing his 
night stick down on beds to rouse a suspect a tiny quiver under 
one bedcover suddenly stopped him 
trembling the officer pulled back the cover and lifted a baby 
boy from the bed he gently cuddled the infant and handed him to 
his frightened mother 
then he bolted out the door 
he went crazy thinking that if he hadnt stopped banging that 
stick in time he would have killed that baby said moshe golan 
a reserve paratrooper who was with the officer named itzik during 
the angry search for a young palestinian stone thrower who had 
injured a fellow soldier 
nearly a year later golan recalls itziks words as they left the 
house in the occupied west bank 
moshe hold me before i collapse you dont know what i almost 
did 
the encounter was one of dozens occurring daily as the israeli 
army tries to halt the palestinian uprising in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip fifteen months after the revolt began some 
soldiers have begun questioning their role in putting down the 
civilian rebellion 
the questions have surfacd in letters to newspapers and to 
members of the knesset israels parliament and in one angry 
exchange with prime minister yitzhak shamir when he visited reserve 
paratroopers in the west bank 
more than 100000 israeli soldiers have served in the occupied 
territories and the reactions are mixed 
some feel guilt over harsh methods used against youthful stone 
throwers some in their preteens others feel the army has an 
undeserved mean image that in fact soldiers moral scruples get in 
the way of effectively halting the revolt 
many feel ambivalent about their actions soldiers tell of being 
demoralized by confrontations with arab youths who curse them and 
hurl stones even under gunfire making troops feel they are 
fighting a losing battle the frustration often makes them lose 
their tempers 
combat training they add has left them unprepared to fight 
civil insurrection where soldiers must hesitate to open fire 
because their enemies dont use guns some soldiers were sent to 
quell protests while still in basic training 
golan who served two months in the west bank was among 
soldiers and army officials interviewed by the associated press on 
the troops feelings about their role in the occupied lands 
i feel constant conflict he said after all an arab is a 
human being but even the most moderate guys tend to get this 
feeling they have to grab the first arab and take out all their 
anger on him to beat him or break his bones 
golan now is a nature guide 
doru ehrlich a 36yearold reserve artilleryman said his 
service in the west bank town of qalqilya left him with the same 
confusion 
i have a guilty conscience about doing things like going 
into homes to arrest people he said you go to conduct an 
arrest theyre all sleeping on the floor a small boy wakes up 
with your gun in his face i think of my own son 
but erhlich added that he thought the army had no choice in 
doing what it has been doing and perhaps should try even stronger 
measures 
ive gotten to the point where im sick of it all we have to 
make a decision either get an order to open up machinegun fire on 
them or to the contrary but just to get this over with 
erhlich described an instance where he lost his temper after 
giving some youngsters candy then spotting the same children 
gathering to throw stones at his patrol 
i wanted to slam somebody i was so angry it makes you feel 
like doing things you dont want to do they get you into such a 
mood that even if you want to remain human they dont let you 
ehrlich said he searched an entire week for one of the boys 
finally i found him i found out where he lived i even found 
a hatchet in his house that kid when i caught him i just bashed 
him in the head even if you love children at that same moment 
youre going to hit him its just because youre there

prime minister shamir facing the anger and frustration of 
soldiers on a visit to troops in the west bank tried to encourage 
the soldiers by blaming the palestinian liberation organinzation 
and saying israels security was at stake 
they force us to bear arms he said 
army officials also have repeatedly said troops open fire only 
when their lives are in danger from barrages of stones 
among the six troops killed in the uprising one has died during 
a stonethrowing incident his skull was crushed by a concrete 
block dropped from a roof more than 400 palestinians have died in 
the revolt most by israeli gunfire 
but some soldiers said they rarely felt danger from the stones 
and added that anger or a hurt sense of national pride could incite 
them to react violently 
you feel like youre playing a game of tag we can run around 
and make you run after us said neil shergin 25 an immigrant 
from rockville md who spent about two months in the gaza strip 
and west bank 
theyre quite courageous if i saw a number of soldiers with 
automatic weapons in their hands id be asking what i could do for 
them and not what i could throw at them 
soldiers also say that orders on when to open fire or beat 
protesters are too vague leaving too much to the discretion of 
individual soldiers in the heat of a clash 
controversy over these orders has emerged in the still 
unfinished trial of four troops charged with beating a 42yearold 
palestinian man to death in the gaza strip while conducting an 
arrest last august 
lt gen dan shomron the israeli military chief of staff 
acknowledged at the trial that standing orders left many gray 
areas 
there can be some incident where commands are not clear even 
with the best of soldiers shomron testified a civilian who 
resists arrest can be beaten he said but when someone stops 
resisting that is a matter of opinion 
some 50 troops have been formally charged or punished for 
illegal beatings and shootings during the uprising the army 
acknowledges others have been punished by officers in individual 
units but no record is available of how many 
on the other hand about 60 soldiers have been tried for 
refusing duty in the occupied territories the small number results 
from israelis pride in their citizen army in which all jewish men 
and women do compulsory duty men serve in the reserves until age 
55 
the army has started to replace some reserve soldiers in the 
territories with border police to cut down reserve duty which rose 
to 62 days from the normal 42 days last year because of the 
uprising they also hope the border police better trained in riot 
control can cut down the number of civilian casualties 
army authorities have acknowledged that some casualties grow 
from soldiers fits of temper 
i know it happens and we try to prevent it said brig gen 
ehud gross the armys chief education officer who is in charge of 
a new program to help soldiers cope with their role as policemen 
this is not a normal situation for military forces who have 
been fighting for survival for 40 years in real wars he said 
we have to face something new in which we really cannot use the 
power we have

robert wise is the wonder of the movie 
season a 74yearold oscar winner who has directed an 
actionfilled tightly budgeted movie on the mean streets of 
manhattans lower east side 
rooftops has proved less than a wonder with critics and at 
the box office but reviewers have generally praised wises 
direction and more than one observer has marveled at his 
achievement after a 10year layoff 
i hadnt been on a set for so long that i didnt know how i 
would go he admitted in an interview at his beverly hills 
office i found i got right back into it as if i had never missed 
a beat i think i really had the respect of the crew people who 
were there i had several of the crew say hey what kind of 
vitamins are you taking youre always up here ahead of us 
it felt good i dont intend for it to be another eight10 
years before i do another film 
rooftops concerns homeless youngsters who occupy the roofs 
of abandoned tenements and the drug dealers who prey on the 
neighborhood it may seem like an unlikely subject for the 
producerdirector of the sound of music but wise who also did 
another street movie west side story doesnt think so 
when you look back over my films he pointed out youll 
see ive had a wide range of genres 
indeed his first film as director was the curse of the cat 
people in 1943 his credits include westerns tribute to a bad 
man science fiction the day the earth stood still the 
andromeda strain dramas i want to live somebody up 
there likes me romance two for the seesaw and war films 
run silent run deep the sand pebbles 
wise was approached for rooftops by howard w koch jr who 
was producing the film for taylor hackfords new visions company 
the director was attracted to the idea of working with young people 
in a contemporary setting although not a musical the film 
included combat dancing and the afrobrazilian martial arts 
capoeira all set to a rock score 
i admit that is not my style of music wise said but i 
had a lot of help from taylor and howard who are more familiar 
with it 
wises last film star trek the motion picture had an 
openend budget that reportedly reached 50 million rooftops 
was something else 
i started out making films in the 1940s on 20day schedules 
and budgets of 150000 he recalled rooftops was nothing 
like that we shot for 4546 days and the budget was about 8 
million which is a modest picture nowadays 
i had a fine crew in new york and we worked very hard we did 
put in long days one day it was 17 hours when we shot a disco 
scene starting at 7 in the morning and finishing at midnight i 
think the picture indicates a lot of that work and effort it shows 
the backgrounds of lower east side in fine style 
born in westchester ind robert wise came west to enter the 
movie business and landed a job in the editing department of rko in 
1933 his editing of citizen kane won his first academy award 
nomination in 1940 after serving his apprenticeship as director 
he became known as a man who could deal with varied temperaments 
and complex productions 
wise has been laden with honors including oscars for the 
sound of music and west side story for which jerome robbins 
shared directors credit and the academys irving thalberg award 
one of hollywoods civicminded figures he has served as president 
of the academy of motion picture arts amp sciences and the directors 
guild of america 
why the long lapse between star trek and rooftops 
i didnt plan it that way wise replied i got very busy 
with the academy where i served three years as president and the 
directors guild chairing its 50th anniversary ive done a lot of 
work with the american film institute and ive spoken at 
universities 
i spent 22 months preparing the musical of zorba working on 
the script with ernie lehman and the music with saul chaplin his 
sound of music collaborators we had scouted locations worked 
on casting anthony quinn john travolta and were ready to start 
production then the bottom fell out of cannon films 
wise also worked on a love story to be filmed in china and 
biographies of mae west and singer anita oday all were abandoned 
he is now considering other projects but hasnt decided on his 
next one

he was the son of a country doctor who rebelled 
against his father went to paris with no musical training and 
within eight years had written one of the worlds greatest 
symphonies 
now the life of hector berlioz the grand 19thcentury romantic 
the frenchman of whom paganini once said you begin where the 
others leave offn a new biography that is 
already being hailed is celebrated ias a classic 
the plaudits should please the university of california author 
david cairns a london music critic drafted more than a third of 
berlioz 18031832 the making of an artist at the university in 
davis where he spent two terms as a visiting professor 
kern holoman chairman of the music department there arranged 
it and it meant i was free from journalism hes one of the worlds 
leading berlioz scholars and is writing a lifeandworks of the 
composer the author said 
asked why he got such help on what might be seen as a rival 
project cairns explained holoman is a friend of mine and its 
good for the prestige of a university to be able to say a book that 
might be well regarded waentury biographies 
hugh canning in the guardian judged it one of the most 
important composer biographies of our times 
berlioz was famous for the symphonie fantastique which 
mirrors his passion for the irish actress harriet smithson and 
which can always fill a modern concert hall 
cairns sees parallels between berlioz and daniel barenboim the 
israeli pianist and conductor who was fired in january as musical 
and artistic director of the new paris bastille opera for allegedly 
demanding too much money and not providing the required repertory 
berlioz often complained of french bureaucratic interference in 
musical life when he was commissioned in 1837 to write a requiem 
for the 1830 revolution he said he had to camp out in the 
government offices to get paid 
cairns who also retranslated berliozs own autobiography 
memoirs is most pleased with his picture of the composers 
early life which he unearthed from the family archive of letters 
and papers and by spending time in the composers hometown la cote 
st andre near grenoble 
its an extraordinary story berlioz didnt have a musical 
upbringing so we dont quite know where his genius came from he 
goes to paris knowing almost nothing about music and in seven or 
eight years writes the symphonie fantastique my book is about 
how this happened the author said in an interview 
berlioz was full of contradictions thats why people find him 
disconcerting 
he was an idealist but also extremely practical a composer 
concerned with every detail the layout of the orchestra how to 
organize a concert how to publicize it people like to pigeonhole 
the dreamer the man of action when a man is both they dont 
quite know how to take him cairns said 
life was always a struggle for berlioz he couldnt make his 
music pay and his love affairs were not very successful whenever 
he met someone who embodied his ideal woman he went overboard but 
reality brought him back to earth 
he found it difficult to find a woman to feel as passionately 
about him as he was about her most people dont live on that 
intense high plain it was a disappointment to him but it helped 
make him what he was as a composer 
cairns said berlioz was rare among egoists in his ability to 
laugh at himself and that is reflected in his music a mixture of 
the romantic and classical 
he was also a fastidious frenchman who couldnt sponge 
his sense of pride prevented him the author said i think 
he would have written much more music but he would have had to 
have had it performed and as the work had to be handcopied it 
meant large bills which he couldnt afford

theyre called the heartbeat of new orleans 
and in music circles the neville brothers are known as 
musicians musicians 
for over 30 years the neville name has been synonymous with all 
the traditions of the crescent city their sound is culled from a 
gumbo of styles jazz caribbean african cajun rock funk 
resulting in music as distinctive as new orleans itself charles 
neville who plays saxophone calls it new orleans rhythm and blues 
the brothers art aaron charles and cyril worked 
individually for more than two decades before they finally merged 
their diverse talents in 1977 after several albums and a twoyear 
interlude the band has just released their new album yellow 
moon 
the collection including eight original songs is perhaps their 
most political and personal album one in which they express their 
concern for social issues 
the albums first single sister rosa is a tribute to rosa 
parks who became one of the catalysts for the civil rights 
movement in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat for a white 
person on a segregated bus in montgomery ala the rapreggae 
number written and performed by percussionist cyril reflects the 
albums overall theme to educate people by increasing their 
awareness 
if you dont learn from history it tends to repeat itself 
because it can definitely happen again said art the keyboardist 
look at the neonazis and skinheads added cyril wearing a 
stop apartheid button we want to give youth a chance to look 
at each other on their own terms rather than how it was in the 
last generation who had a certain amount of fear and hatred pumped 
into them before they got a chance to look at people and decide for 
themselves 
we want to convey to youth that they dont have to be 
superhuman or smart to make a change for the better in the world 
my blood another song by cyril speaks about the roots of 
oppression with particular mention of south africans haitians and 
american indians 
theres also a remake of sam cookes a change is gonna come 
and two bob dylan covers the ballad of hollis brown and with 
god on our side although aaron and cyril trade off as lead 
vocalists on most of the album art gets the chance to belt out 
fire and brimstone with the same enthusiasm he seems to have 
for life in general charles is heard prominently on the 
instrumental healing chant 
there is a tenuous and harmonious thread to yellow moon 
partly due to producer daniel lanois peter gabriel u2 recording 
style he used a new orleans apartment instead of a studio 
his method of recording is to build the studio around the 
artist rather than force the artist to conform to some existing 
environment charles said 
the nickname for the studio became the swamp cyril said 
with a laugh a whole atmosphere was created which you are able 
to hear on the record 
jonathan demme something wild married to the mob 
directed the video for sister rosa the filmmaker shares the 
musicians interest in haiti after working with artists there and 
hearing cyril sing my blood demme wanted american artists to 
go to haiti to perform 
but he didnt want it to be like a sun city said cyril 
referring to the socalled integrated music venue in south africa 
he wanted people with more similar roots and backgrounds the 
brothers and demme are working on a video with the haitian band la 
fere parent 
the brothers musical roots go back to the 50s art was part of 
the hawkettes in 1954 when they recorded the legendary new orleans 
anthem mardi gras mambo in the 1970s he helped form the 
meters a funk group with great impact on fellow musicians and such 
new bands as the police 
charles was busy touring with big mac bell bobby blue bland 
and bb king aaron had a top 10 hit in 1967 with tell it like 
it is cyril was involved in his own band before he joined art 
with the meters in europe who were touring with the rolling stones 
when charles and aaron joined the meters to record the wild 
tchoupitoulas album it was the first time in years the brothers 
had all played together 
it happened so easily and beautifully and we were so proud of 
the finished product said cyril so they decided to form the 
neville brothers 
although their popularity stems from their hometown of new 
orleans they initially didnt have a large following as a group 
we used to play tipitinas you could blow it up and get no one 
but the neville brothers art recalled but were just enjoying 
it as it happens tipitinas is a popular new orleans music hall 
and was featured in the film the big easy along with the 
neville brothers music 
after the release of their first album the neville 
brothers the group took off their 1981 fiyo on the bayou 
was a critical and commercial success rolling stones guitarist 
keith richards called it the best album of that year but their 
1987 uptown didnt quite make it even devoted fans felt it was 
an attempt at mass appeal yellow moon should dispel any doubts 
of the brothers integrity 
a cinemax special in may will include such guests as bonnie 
raitt gregg allman buckwheat zydeco jimmy buffett john hiatt 
and tv journalist ed bradley who will perform sixty minute man 
with the brothers bradley is one of many fans who has danced with 
wild abandon at a neville brothers concert our music is 
definitely dance music thats the way to respond to it said 
charles the same energy we put out is recycled through the 
audience in a place with no dance floor theres less energy 
coming back from the audience

court in issuing one of its earliest civil rights opinions 
upholds a lower courts ruling that the men are free 
in a recent interview chaseriboud pronounced riboo is 
asked why isnt this story taught in every high school american 
history class 
i think thats a common reaction how why hasnt it become 
a part of american history she said and i can just say that 
he joseph cinque is one of those invisible men of history hes 
not the only one that have for one reason or another been 
eliminated or forgotten because of race because of status or 
simply by accident 
chaseriboud is a philadelphiaborn sculptor novelist and poet 
who has lived in paris since the early 1960s she is a striking 
woman with exquisite cheekbones and a pleasing voice who frames her 
words carefully when she speaks she will not give her age 
reference works say she was born in either 1936 or 1939 
her first work of fiction sally hemings created a 
sensation in 1979 with its imaginative depiction of the affair that 
thomas jefferson is believed to have had with one of his slaves for 
38 years fathering her seven children after its publication 
jefferson historians insisted anew that there has never been any 
substantiation of the affair the book earned chaseriboud the 
janet heidinger kafka prize for excellence in fiction by an 
american woman 
chaseriboud said one of her most surprising finds in 
researching the saga of joseph cinque was discovering that the 
19thcentury mende society of the guinea coast had a judicial 
system amazingly similar to the american one they had a supreme 
court a district court a circuit court they had appeal witness 
crossexamination and bail 
that allowed me to present cinque not as a kind of dumb savage 
in a situation he doesnt understand but as a man a very 
perplexed man stuck in a situation that he does understand 
chaseriboud spent three years working on echo of lions 
poring over court transcripts recorded in longhand at the archives 
of the us supreme court the library of congress and elsewhere 
but why use the novel form after such painstaking historical 
research 
to dramatize a historical personage who has not entered into 
the mainstream you have to find his personality imagine one for 
him she said then recited a favorite quotation by voltaire 
there is no history only fictions of varying degrees of 
plausibility 
you have only to read two books on the same historical person 
to know that theres a lot of interpretation even in history 
she said 
chaseriboud who studied fine arts at temple and yale 
universities was already a recognized sculptor before she began 
writing novels her bronzeandtextile pieces are in the permanent 
collections of the museum of modern art and metropolitan museum of 
art in new york and the centre pompidou in paris her writer 
friends to take on these littleknown tales she found so 
fascinating valide her novel published two years ago is in 
the same spirit it is about white slavery in the ottoman empire 
the author sees sally hemings and echo of lions as the y 
ring the bgg7b

lite olive oil may have no fewer calories 
cereal boasting all natural fruit flavors may have more salt 
and coloring than flavor and sugarfree snacks may have 
sweeteners as fattening as sugar 
and how many grams does it take to fill you up anyway 
whats a healthconscious consumer to do 
frank e young who heads the federal agency that regulates the 
labels on much of our food can sympathize hes a doctor and even 
he has trouble 
its hard to read labels and figure out what to eat said 
young commissioner of the us food and drug administration which 
is responsible for labels on foods not regulated by the us 
department of agriculture labels on food he said are a relic 
hed get no argument from consumer groups 
statements on food packages by law must be true but 
manufacturers may not tell consumers all they want to know that 
sugarfree snack for example or an oat bran muffin with several 
tablespoons of fat at 100 calories a tablespoon 
saturated fat is still not listed cholesterol is still not 
listed and fiber is still not listed these are the nutrients 
the surgeon general has told the american public to watch for when 
they go shopping said bruce silverglade director of legal 
affairs for the washingtonbased consumer advocacy group center for 
science in the public interest 
food processors say the problem is that many consumers arent 
sufficiently informed about ingredients to interpret information 
already on labels 
you get into good foodbad food good ingredientbad 
ingredient when what you want to look at is your overall diet 
said allen matthys director of regulatory affairs for the national 
food processors association its 450 processors favor current 
regulations making many nutrition labels voluntary 
you can reduce risks by modifying diet young said that 
means you have to give much more information you have to give 
interpretations of the information 
the fda was sidetracked from food label reform by such issues as 
aids and food additives he said but labeling will be a dominant 
issue this year and the agency is considering new regulations on 
fiber and cholesterol 
young wouldnt speculate what those rules might require 
silverglade agreed that prospects for reform appear better 
whats changed is that several very important reports have been 
issued advising americans to modify their diet 
among them was surgeon general c everett koops report last 
summer that nearly 15 million people died in 1987 from diseases 
associated with diet 
also consumers are becoming increasingly frustrated with 
labels silverglade said a coalition that includes several medical 
and dietary groups the national council on the aging and consumer 
federation of america is meeting with federal officials to lobby 
for changes this year from the fda or congress 
the center for science in the public interest has proposed 
labels with a traffic light system of colored panels for 
calories fiber fat and salt its proposal would require labels 
for fast foods percentages of major ingredients in a food and 
disclosure of cholesterol saturated fat and fiber 
food labels could be one of the greatest measures we could 
take to benefit the health of americans said silverglade noting 
the costs in lives and dollars from dietrelated disease 
still young said it likely will be years before consumers see 
changes 
the usdas food safety and inspection service approves labels 
for products that contain at least 2 percent poultry or 3 percent 
meat its standards say for example that a product called beef 
with gravy must be at least 50 percent beef while gravy with beef 
must be 35 percent beef it also regulates eggs 
of the rest of food regulated by the fda only about 55 percent 
have nutrition labels regulations the fda adopted in 1973 require 
them only if nutrients are added or if a nutritional benefit claim 
is made 
all food labels must provide the name of the product the name 
and location of the manufacturer packer or distributor and the 
net contents or net weight but not all foods must list even the 
ingredients the fda has a standard of identity for about 300 
foods such as mayonnaise and ketchup and doesnt require 
ingredient lists for products that fit the standard 
there are two issues the fda must consider 
one is nutrition labels now on the back or side of packages 
listing ingredients in descending order by weight and perserving 
amounts of calories protein and certain vitamins and minerals 
the second is health claim labels which first appeared in 1984 
usually on the front of a package 
health claims are claims that talk about the people that eat 
the food nutrition claims are claims that are made about the 
properties of the food said john l stanton professor of food 
marketing research at st josephs university in philadelphia 
we really need a strategy that includes both of them young 
said but there is no consensus whether all packaged foods should 
have labels what information should be included or how it should 
be provided 
in the meantime the fda has a proposal its second such effort 
awaiting office of management and budget approval that would 
regulate health claims 
the fda is taking a cautious approach limiting label 
statements to things on which there is a consensus based on the 
surgeon generals report said f edward scarbrough deputy 
director of the fdas office of nutrition and food sciences center 
of food safety and applied nutrition 
five things would be addressed fats and heart disease fats and 
cancer fiber and cancer calcium and osteoporosis and sodium and 
hypertension the fda would come up with model label statements 
that manufacturers could use or companies could write their own 
within certain guidelines 
young would not even guess whether omb would act on the proposal 
this year and some consumer groups say theres little chance a 
rule would be adopted 
silverglade said fda and omb are caught in a bureaucratic 
trench warfare over the wording of the rule omb is insisting on a 
very weak rule that will allow manufacturers to write their own 
ticket and slap practically whatever health claims they choose on 
their product 
fda inaction has prompted nine states to start negotiating with 
food companies directly said steve gardner assistant attorney 
general in texas weve seen a plethora of pretty outrageous 
claims of health benefits even with the good products the basic 
venal nature of the companies is such that they cant avoid making 
misleading or untruthful claims 
in addition legislation has been submitted to congress that 
would require disclosure of more information about saturated fats 
and establish standards for lite foods currently lite or 
light except on meats can mean fewer calories or just a 
lighter color or texture 
other bills are expected including one requiring nutrition 
labels on all fdaregulated foods 
despite a lack of regulation health claims already appear on 
many foods 
kellogg co broke the ice in 1984 when it linked consumption of 
allbran cereal with reduction of cancer risks the label said in 
part the national cancer institute reports that highfiber 
lowfat diets may reduce some kinds of cancer allbran is a 
highfiber cereal 
fdas options were to declare the cereal a drug and force 
kellogg to undergo the lengthy procedures for drug approval or to 
try to come up with a regulation that would allow such labels 
seizing allbran young said would have been ridiculous the 
agency still is seeking a solution 
because many consumers are trying to eat better some officials 
fear poorly regulated health claims might do more harm than good 
a food high in fiber might brag about that without owning up to 
also being high in salt so you dont have a heart attack 
gardner said you would have a stroke instead

here are definitions of some terms used on food labels as 
provided by the us food and drug administration 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
cholesterol fatlike substances found in meat poultry and 
dairy products cholesterol is essential to some body functions 
but the body can make what it needs so the amount in many diets is 
excessive increasing risk of heart disease 
emulsifiers widely used in food processing these stabilize fat 
and water mixtures so they wont separate in mayonnaise for 
example egg yolks emulsify the oil and lemon juice or vinegar in 
chocolate and margarine lecithin derived from soybeans is the 
emulsifier 
humectants chemicals such as glycerol propylene glycol and 
sorbitol that are added to foods to help retain moisture fresh 
taste and texture often used in candy and shredded coconut 
hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated labeling terms that 
describe the process of adding hydrogen to an unsaturated fat to 
make it saturated oils may be hydrogenated to varying degress to 
make them suitable for use in products such as margarine the more 
an oil is hydrogenated the more saturated fatty acids it contains 
light or lite labeling language that suggests a food is lower 
in calorie content unless some other meaning is specified or 
obvious a lite product intended to be useful in 
weightreduction must have no more than 40 calories a serving and 
no more than 04 calories a gram to be called lowcalorie a 
reducedcalorie food must be at least onethird lower in 
calories than the food to which it is compared foods naturally low 
in calories cannot use these terms foods labeled diet or 
dietetic must meet the requirements for low or reducedcalorie 
foods or be clearly marked as useful for another special dietary 
purpose 
natural a term that appears on many products but has no 
official definition for fdaregulated foods natural meats 
however are minimally processed and contain no artificial flavors 
colors or preservatives 
sodium a chemical essential for regulating body fluids and 
muscle function but in excessive amounts linked with increased 
risk of high blood pressure food labeled sodiumfree must have 
less than 5 milligrams per serving very low sodium 35 
milligrams or less a serving reduced sodium the usual level 
reduced by 75 percent table salt or sodium chloride is one kind 
of sodium 
sugarfree or sugarless table sugar sucrose fructose and 
corn syrup are among the caloriecontaining sweeteners in food a 
food labeled sugarfree may have calories from natural sugars 
xylitol sorbitol and mannitol provided the basis for the claim 
is explained

physicians need to listen with their 
eyes according to a doctor who believes patients sometimes say 
yes while their bodies are really saying no no no to 
treatment 
the doctor who understands that body language can deal with the 
conflict and try to help instead of sending the patients away 
unhappy said dr cecile carson chief of behavioral and 
psychosocial medicine at genesee hospital 
its not what we say but how we say it and how a patient 
hears it that makes a difference agreed dr robert e mcafee of 
portland me a member of the american medical association board 
of trustees it goes to the question of who you want for your 
doctor if you come to me and keep coming back to me its probably 
because i quote tend to hit off with you unquote 
carson supported by a grant from the national fund for medical 
education has adapted nonverbal communication theories shrugs 
folded arms and glances and is teaching medical students and 
lecturing around the country 
suppose a doctor believes her patient should change medication 
to lower his blood pressure the doctor notes all the potential 
benefits explains why she thinks it would be a good idea and then 
asks her patient what he thinks 
the patient crosses his arms raises his shoulders slightly and 
leans back in the chair his eyes get noticeably wider and he holds 
his breath as he says it sounds like a good idea to me the 
mouth said yes the body said no 
the important thing is to notice that youre getting a mixed 
message then i ask which message do you think would predict that 
patients behavior the answer is the nonverbal one and you have 
to know that carson said 
you may not have time to work it all out at that visit but you 
need to note it so youre not frustrated or angry when they come 
back and say they havent taken it she said 
to better read body language a doctor must calibrate the 
patient by asking particular questions and watching the physical 
response the doctor also should be aware that sitting behind a 
desk to give a prognosis can be perceived as uncaring and distant 
and that standing over a patient in a hospital bed and talking can 
make a patint feel weak and unsafe carson said 
she also emphasizes pacing adjusting body movements to a 
patients movements in order to make a patient feel more 
comfortable so if a patient has her arms crossed the doctor 
might want to cross his arms if the patient is leaning forward 
the doctor might want to lean forward 
carson believes that nonverbal communication is a skill that 
can be acquired with practice and that even people who recognize 
and respond to many nonverbal actions need to be taught some 
people are sort of innately better at this but they may not be 
doing this consciously people who do this as a matter of style 
even they hit snags 
generally when the doctorpatient interaction falls apart she 
said the first the doctors say is that theyve got a hostile or an 
uncooperative patient on their hands they dont ask if theres 
something they can do

when towering thunderstorms threaten 
lloyd huffman fires up the doppler radar he built from military 
surplus parts 
unlike conventional radar doppler can detect the speed and 
direction of raindrops within a storm allowing huffman to spot 
rotation that could indicate the formation of a tornado and warn 
the weather service and local authorities 
it just kind of grew over the years huffman said of the 
radar hes been tuning up in anticipation of the aprilthroughjune 
tornado season 
with a few differences cost being a big one huffmans sband 
doppler is like the nexrad system being tested at the national 
severe storms laboratory in norman okla and planned for 
nationwide installation in the coming decade 
huffman asked the laboratory for the plans to build his doppler 
after they believed us they gave us the information we needed 
he said 
huffman built his first radar station in 1976 using world war 
ii surplus army and navy equipment and putting the antenna on the 
local hospital he began working in 1979 on the present station 
which became dopplercapable in 1985 
im very interested in thunderstorm structure he said 
huffman 42 has a degree in physics from north texas state 
university after working as a communications systems designer for 
motorola in dallas he returned to his hometown in 1974 and started 
his own communications business 
huffman and his crew staff the station whenever severe weather 
is possible hes in microwave link with wfaatv in dallas and 
talks by radio with national weather service meteorologists in fort 
worth 
the radar can detect rain intensity for several hundred miles 
but can only process doppler information for about 150 miles the 
radar pulses about 1000 times a second sending a beam about 1 
degrees wide the reflected data is sorted into range bins each 
150 meters deep 
a computer remembers and compares the location of raindrops 
allowing it to determine the speed and direction the speed of 
rotation is the rate of change of phase angle thats the 
velocity huffman explained 
the computer assigns a color to each velocity red indicates 
movement toward the station green is away painting a picture of 
the storm the right combination of colors on the southwest corner 
of a thunderstorm provides a mesocyclone vortex signature 
indicating rotation 
after several minutes of observation and tilting the radar beam 
up and down huffman might spot elongation into a cylinder that 
could mean a tornado he then makes sure the national weather 
service knows and uses policeband radios to notify authorities in 
surrounding counties 
huffman has the money to upgrade his system by speeding up the 
computer and adding memory but said it takes a lot of time its 
a mechanical electrical electronic and computer project a 
little of everything involved in in it 
he calls the project a good community thing to do 
it is funded by the navarro community foundation money from 
wealthy families that profited from two oil booms operating 
expenses are covered by wfaatv in dallas which shows the radar 
during weathercasts the station sits on an acre provided by the 
corsicana independent school district a donated 80foot oil 
derrick supports a 25footdiameter fiberglas dome containing the 
16 foot dish antenna at the base of the derrick is a building 
housing the radar and the computer equipment that makes it 
different from conventional systems 
nexrad costing millions as opposed to huffmans 50000 since 
1976 will differ by having builtin computer programs to compare 
data with regional models and issue an automatic warning of tornado 
likelihood 
but huffman enjoys being able to interpret his data by himself 
theyll never completely replace the man in front of the radar 
screen agrees weather service severe storms specialist al moller 
in fort worth we have to strike a balance in technology 
research and training of people responsible for issuing watches and 
warnings

here are some tornado facts from the national weather service 
insurance information institute and news accounts 
tornadoes can occur in any month but are more frequent from 
april through june and between 3 and 6 pm 
most tornadoes track southwest to northeast but their paths 
can spiral erratically 
the portion of a thunderstorm adjacent to large hail is where 
tornadoes are most likely to occur 
there were 32 tornadorelated deaths reported in 1988 down 
from 59 in 1987 and well below the average of 99 a year 
less than 2 percent of all tornadoes are classified as violent 
with wind speeds of more than 200 mph and a path averaging 26 
miles the longest tornado on record went 219 miles across 
missouri illinois and indiana in march 1925 
tornadoes travel at an average 30 mph but can stand still or 
go 70 mph 
the largest single outbreak of twisters on record was in april 
1974 when 148 storms killed 300 people in 13 states over two days 
when a tornado threatens seek shelter in the basement or 
central parts of the house office or school building away from 
windows

fruits and vegetables high in boron like 
apples and broccoli appear to keep bones stronger by preventing 
loss of calcium 
you could drink milk to kingdom come and never get any 
boron said forrest h nielsen director of the department of 
agricultures human nutrition research center in grand forks nd 
nielsen led a study of five men and 10 women who were given a 
lowboron diet for nine weeks then boron supplements for seven 
weeks when the boron was reduced the subjects excreted more 
calcium their bodies werent using it 
when boron was increase there was less calcium in their 
urine and more calcium and an active form of vitamin d in their 
blood he said 
nielsen said nobody knows yet exactly what boron does in the 
body the first studies suggesting that it might be important were 
done in 1987 before 1987 there was no evidence that it might be 
important in human nutrition wed known it was essential to plants 
since 1910 but we still dont know what its biochemical role is 
in plants 
nielsen said he isnt suggesting boron supplements large 
amounts can cause changes similar to osteoporosis brittleness of 
bones resulting from a loss of calcium and a wellbalanced diet 
will include enough he said 
boron is found in broccoli cabbage and other leafy vegetables 
nuts legumes and fruits especially apples pears and grapes he 
said but when you talk about a meat and potatoes and milk and 
cheese diet youre talking about a diet low in boron i think its 
absent in a lot of diets 
harold sandstead chairman of preventive medicine and community 
health at the university of texas medical branch in galveston 
said the findings are extremely interesting and might have 
importance for human health they have to be confirmed by another 
researcher but these are very careful workers

earth berms on either side of a 
highway cut noise levels in nearby neighborhoods better than 
barrier walls a researcher says 
these are even more effective if they are covered with grass 
or other vegetation because the carpet of plants absorbs the 
sound said sabih hayek a professor of engineering science and 
mechanics without vegetation the berms simply reflect most of the 
sound back onto the roadway 
most trees increase noise to neighborhoods near busy 
thoroughfares because sound is reflected off leaves he said fir 
trees will work better because their needles do not reflect sound 
in fact they absorb sound 
artificial walls of concrete fiberglass or wood reflect noise 
back onto the roadway or over the barrier said hayek whose 
research was sponsored by the national cooperative highway research 
program of the transportation research board representing 50 state 
highway departments 
it is possible to cut as much noise as you want using noise 
barriers hayek said however costs increase dramatically with 
the increase in desired noise reduction a 15foothigh wall 
costs 200 to 250 a foot to build 
we have tested noise barriers covered with materials that 
absorb sound but the added cost of construction is notical 
compared with the slight increase in noise reduction achieved with 
absorbent barriers he said 
double walls decrease noise levels behind them threefold over a 
single wall and horizontal overhangs on vertical walls also can 
greatly decrease noise levels but are very expensive to buildhe 
said

human bones found in an anasazi ceremonial 
chamberuggest the generally peaceful farmers may have turned to 
cannibalism at least for rituals that likely included prisoners 
an archaeologist says 
my first reaction was oh my god soch for our peaceful 
farmers said john cater a graduate student at 
coloradoboulder they were so shattered that it was all very 
clear what was going on 
archaeologists discovered the bones piled in neat patterns and 
some smashed to bits in a kiva near the central firepit lay 
stone axes and knives still smeared with microscopic traces of 
ancient gore the wooden ceiling of the kiva was collapsed when the 
carnage was compleed obscuring the evidence for nearly 1000 
years near what is now the town of yellow jacket cater said 
he believes the victims may have been prisoners and rules out 
hunger as a reason for the carnage weve seen too many examples 
of when times got rough people just got up and left that would be 
a bption than eating the nextdoor 
frederick lange curator of anthropology at the university 
museum endorses caters analysis but he said evidence at other 
sites suggests some desperate anasazi may have resorted to 
cannibalism to ave off starvation 
the anasazi started a network of highrise cliff dwellings in 
the southwest about ad 400 and deserted them 900 years later 
presumably after drought or invasion barely 10 percent of known 
anasazi ruins in colorado utah arizew mexico have been 
excavated signs of cannibalism have been found in up to 20 digs 
scattered over thousands of square miles and centuries

department store chain carson pirie scott amp co 
says its board of directors will review a 282 million takeover bid 
from competitor pa bergner amp co but it already has cast doubts 
on the likelihood of a merger 
carson spokeswoman kate leatham declined to comment sunday on 
whether the 20pershare cash takeover bid was welcome but in a 
statement carson characterized the proposal as unsolicited 
highly conditional and ambiguous 
ms leatham said the proposal was received late friday 
afternoon she said the board will consider the bid but that a 
board meeting had not yet been set according to the carson 
statement bergner offered at least 20 per share in cash for 
carson or alternatively offered to acquire only carsons 
department store division for an unspecified combination of cash 
stock and notes 
bergner spokesman jerry seeman said the company had retained 
shearson lehman hutton inc and financo as its advisers for the 
proposal and had been assured by its commercial bank of funding for 
a possible acquisition 
the offer appears to clash with several recent moves announced 
by carson chairman peter willmott 
last month willmott said carson planned to sell its catalog 
operation and close its corporate level specialty store in 
washington dc as part of a restructuring program begun in 1987 
carsons department store business consists of 33 stores in the 
chicago area and in minnesota the company also owns county seat a 
jeans and casualclothing specialty chain with about 400 stores 
carson reported revenues of 102 billion and a net loss of 38 
million much of it resulting from the catalog operation for 
fiscal 1988 
bergner operates 31 department stores in illinois and wisconsin 
seeman said the company reported revenues of 470 million last 
year but added that a profit or loss figure was not available 
immediately 
bergner is owned by the maus and nordmann families swiss 
nationals who operate 70 department stores in switzerland and the 
wellknown au printemps department store in paris

government workers were manning the telephones 
monday answering questions and listening to complaints on the 
sweeping overhaul of the nations tax system 
the fair trade commission has received more than 300 inquiries 
from tokyo residents alone on the new 3 percent sales tax 
implemented over the weekend commission spokesman eiichiro kokubo 
said 
most of the callers to the commissions cartel emergency 
line pointed out unwarranted price markups and expressed fears 
of inflation he said 
the acrosstheboard tax on commodities and services known here 
as a consumption tax was the highlight of the reform led by prime 
minister noboru takeshita 
with adjustments in a variety of taxes under the reform prices 
fluctuated for example some imported liquor prices fell while 
milk prices rose and soft drinks in vending machines stayed the 
same television sets were cheaper but newspapers raised their 
prices 
the government granted a special exemption for small businesses 
with annual sales of less than 232558 freeing them from 
collecting the 3 percent tax 
but many enterprises which are technically exempt such as 
independent taxis and discount stores raised prices anyway some 
did so to offset increased operating costs others simply for 
profit 
the commissions telephone advisory service will continue for 
two years and the the commission will be on guard for pernicious 
cases kokubo said 
meanwhile the economic planning agency has received some 760 
phone calls since april 1 spokesperson mitsuko asada said 
about onethird of the callers complained of unreasonably high 
price hikes she said while many other callers had a questions 
about the tax system itself 
we cannot directly impose administrative guidance on the 
retailers but the agency notifies related ministries if we receive 
a number of similar complaints or if the price hike exceeds 3 
percent ms asada said 
consumer unions throughout the nation also have received about 
400 phone calls from consumers in the last two days she added 
concerns over inflation and excessive price hikes discouraged 
many shoppers last weekend and a sale at the takashimaya 
department store in tokyo brought in 10 percent less sales than 
normal for weekends said takashimaya spokesman satoshi ogawa 
i guess this is a kind of setback from the sales we made in 
march when consumers bought so much to stock up he said 
he said it will take more than a month to determine how the 
consumer tax will affect the stores sales 
the tax reform and a stockprofiteering scandal involving 
takeshita and many of his partys elite have led to support ratings 
as low as 9 percent in recent opinion polls

nissan motor manufacturing coro usa 
announced today that it will spend 490 million to upgrade its 
manufacturing plant here to add another line of cars 
the expansion will add 2000 new jobs and boost annual 
production to 440000 cars and light pickup trucks said jerry 
benefield president of nissan motor manufacturing corp usa 
the vehicle will be a new fourdoor model that will compete in 
the lower middle market segment benefield said 
nissan now produces 205816 vehicles annually at the smyrna 
plant its only plant in the united states and employs more than 
3000 people 
benefield announced in october that nissan planned to produce a 
new line of cars in the early 1990s the company said at that time

meet consumer demand in the united states 
nissan is a subsidiary of nissan motor co ltd which is based 
in japan 
last year nissan announced a 311 million expansion to produce

year to design and build a minivan and begin production in 1991 
the smyrna plant will produce doors fenders and other major body

the number of working oil and gas rigs jumped 
this week by 13 to total 779 marking the second consecutive weekly 
increases after a lengthy downward trend baker hughes inc 
reported monday 
last week the rig count increased by 26 following a decline of 
three in the previous week a year ago the total was 941 the 
company said 
we like to see three weeks in a row before we declare that 
its up but weve got two of the three already baker hughes 
economist ike kerridge said 
we havent had a normal year recently but if you look back 
over a number of years the count usually bottoms out in late march 
or early april and then it turns back up kerridge said were 
hopeful that this will prove to be the upturn 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker copmany that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states texas had the biggest increase 
with 15 additional rigs followed by new mexico eight 
pennsylvania two and colorado kansas and north dakota one each 
oklahoma showed the sharpest decline with six fewer rigs 
followed by california five wyoming three ohio two and 
louisiana and michigan one each

chrysler corp plunged into a new automaker 
incentive battle today with interestfree loans undercutting 29 
percent financing deals offered last week by its two big us 
rivals because of slow sales 
the no 3 automakers no more mr nice guy program gives 
free financing on twoyear loans for 1988 and 1989model cars and 
some trucks the rates for longer loans range from 59 percent to 
109 percent no expiration date for the program was set 
it cant get any lower chrysler motors chairman bennett e 
bidwell said it cant get any simpler it cant get any better 
for the customer 
the zero percent financing program covers all chryslers 1988 
and 1989 cars 99 percent of its trucks and about 25 percent of its 
hotselling jeep models 
ford motor co started the latest wave wednesday with a plan 
featuring 29 percent interest rates on twoyear loans general 
motors corp followed a day later basically matching fords move 
its the first time in nearly two years that the big three have 
brawled so aggressively with cheap financing for cars reflecting 
their fear of a consumer buying slowdown that could create huge 
backlogs of unsold 1989 models 
fords vice president for north american sales robert rewey 
acknowledged last wednesday that part of the motivation for the no 
2 automakers move into heavier incentives was because early 1989 
sales have been below expectations 
lowfinancing or cash rebate incentives when theyre working 
can shrink automakers inventories make serious buyers out of 
casual lookers and give the industry a shot in the arm during 
sagging sales periods 
when they dont work they can eat profits and put an unwelcome 
burden on dealers 
automakers are betting that incentives will provide the boost 
the industry needs to get back on track during the normally busy 
early spring period 
the new incentive programs from ford and gm also make fouryear 
financing more attractive by reducing the interest rate from 89 
percent to 69 percent 
car and truck sales during the middle 10 days of march were up 5 
percent over the same period of 1988 but down 53 percent for the 
first 20 days of the month and down 54 percent since jan 1 
sales figures for all of march are due tuesday 
some analysts have been revising their earnings projections for 
the automakers this year one reason is slower sales and another is 
the costly incentives designed to raise sales in the first place

said monday the exportimport bank of japan would make 45 billion 
available over the next few years to help third world countries out 
of their debt problems 
a spokesman for the world bank said that japanese authorities 
have promised its president barber conable that these loans would 
not be tied to purchases of japanese goods as is usually the case 
with loans from such governmentowned banks 
sumita made his announcement at a meeting of the interim 
committee of the international monetary fund

will be in better position to repay

the supreme court handed down a victory monday 
to thousands of creditors owed billions of dollars by failed 
savings and loans 
overturning a lower court ruling the high court decided that 
disputes in which the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
takes over failing statechartered thrifts should be decided by a 
federal judge not in state courts the justice department had 
argued that the lower court ruling if allowed to stand could have 
serious consequences for the fslic which is under financial 
strains to insure deposits in failing savings and loan associations 
in another decision the highcourt justices gave a boost to 
state treasuries by ruling that states dont have to provide tax 
relief for companies paying federal windfall profit taxes 
in a suit filed against new jersey by 13 oil companies 
including giants exxon corp and texaco inc the high court said 
an additional state tax does not unduly interfere with interstate 
commerce since the companies operated numerous refineries in that 
state but do not drill for oil there 
the windfall tax imposed by the carter administration was 
repealed by congress last year but there may be some companies 
still paying on past earnings 
in the fslic dispute the supreme court decided an insurer could 
sue in federal court when it seeks to collect money potentially 
hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly owed to the failing 
thrift institutions 
the fslic acts as receiver in helping liquidate scores of 
statechartered savings and loan institutions 
an appeals court had ruled in a case involving manning savings 
and loan association in illinois that the federal courts lacked 
such authority when the alleged violations of federal law are 
secondary to related state law charges 
former manning directors were accused of declaring two illegal 
dividends in the early 1980s 
an illinois regulatory agency ruled the dividends violate state 
law because mannings net worth was insufficient however the 
deadline for suing the manning directors in illinois state courts 
had passed 
in other court rulings monday the justices 
agreed to decide whether defense contractors violate a federal 
conflictofinterest law when paying severance to employees who 
quit to take important government jobs the court said it will hear 
appeals by the boeing co and five former employees who received 
485000 in severance when they left to take jobs in the reagan 
administration 
dismissed a dispute over the confidentiality of lawyers 
documents in a case stemming from a defense contractors fraudulent 
travel reimbursement scheme the court refused to hear appeals by 
martin marietta corp and a former employee who said the company is 
trying to make him the scapegoat for the scheme 
left intact a ruling that permits widespread drug testing of 
workers in the nuclear power industry the court turned away an 
appeal by workers applying for jobs with a company that does 
maintenance work on a nuclear plant in washington state 
ordered reconsideration of a ruling that allows district of 
columbia officials to require drug testing for employees involved 
in the busing of handicapped students the justices had decided 
last month that drug and alcohol tests should be administered for 
railway workers involved in accidents or jobs that require carrying 
a firearm 
refused to throw out an indictment accusing new york hotel 
owners harry and leona helmsley of federal income tax evasion the 
court let stand a ruling that dismissed the helmsleys challenge to 
the 47count indictment 
refused to revive a lawsuit by penthouse international stemming 
from its failure to get financing for an atlantic city nj 
casino the court let stand a ruling that threw out a 1287 
million judgment penthouse won against a virginia savings and loan 
company and a washington law firm

foreign investors are moving through this town 
as though it were a giant swap meet with australias qintex group 
offering 1 billion for united artists and japans sony corp 
browsing for a similar major film production property 
never before has overseas fascination in the entertainment 
industry reached such a feverish level as large and small studios 
are now changing hands at the rate of one a month 
the foreign interest in the properties is certainly not 
going down jeffrey logsdon director of institutional research 
for crowell weedon amp co said monday 
sparked by the prospects of a deregulated european television 
market advances in entertainment technology worldwide and a 
favorable exchange rate companies and investors from england to 
italy are clamoring to obtain enough programming to fill the 
pending void 
in addition to fridays agreement by qintex coproducers of the 
miniseries lonesome dove to buy rain man maker united 
artists for 1 billion british broadcaster television south plc 
acquired television producer mtm enterprises for 310 million in 
july 
australian businessman alan saffron bought film producer 
atlantic entertainment in december for an undisclosed amount and 
italian producers giancarlo parretti and florio fiorini have been 
grabbing up a variety of hollywood properties in 1989 including 
ministudios cannon group and new world pictures 
for the past few days hollywood has been buzzing with rumors 
that sony corp was set to purchase entertainment conglomerate mca 
inc a deal that analysts price at around 5 billion while 
officials from both companies insist that no buyout is in the 
works such a merger does make sense for the japanese entertainment 
hardware giant 
sony purchased cbs records home of michael jackson and bruce 
springsteen for more than 2 billion in 1988 and has made no 
secret that it wants to buy a film studio 
were looking at hollywood because of our interest in video 
precisely the same reason we looked at cbs records because of our 
interest in audio sony vice chairman michael schuloff said not 
long ago 
even though the film industry is enjoying record profits 
overall several studios are desperately in need of money 
although mca is not one of them a sony purchase would give the 
japanese enterprise not only premium film producer universal 
studios but also a valuable film and television library mca 
records murder she wrote maker universal television mca home 
video mcas growing theme park franchise a cable television unit 
a publishing group a concert and sports merchandising arm and a 
49 percent share in movie theater chain cineplex odeon 
sony is probably looking for software to complement their 
hardware said chris jones an entertainment analyst with bateman 
eichler what they could be interested in buying is up to 
question they could even just be interested in obtaining the asian 
distribution rights to movies television and music 
logsdon of crowell weedon said that by buying a successful film 
producer foreign companies are absolved from the challenge of 
matching hollywood expertise 
there are four parts to a successful movie studio logsdon 
said you have to have creative talent youve got to have 
production capabilities youve got to have marketing and 
distribution clout and then youve got to have finance wherever 
you go in the world people just dont seem to be able to duplicate 
the first two parts that are inherent within us studios 
so rather than trying to go out and trying to reinvent the 
wheel yourself and as long as american culture is going to be 
held out as some kind of world standard i think theres going to 
be an attractiveness to those assets logsdon said 
mca has quite a few assets 
in 1982 universal released the highestgrossing movie ever 
et the extraterrestrial and the film went on to set records 
at the nations video stores in 1988 the company has also reaped 
large profits from 1973s the sting 1975s jaws 1985s 
back to the future and last years twins 
mca records carries the popular teen vocalist tiffany as well 
as the sultry star sheena easton and young soul singer bobby brown 
in june 1988 a joint venture which is 20 percent owned by mca 
acquired the record company assets of motown record corp 
universal television has produced the shows murder she 
wrote miami vice the ateam and the new leave it to 
beaver 
universal studios hollywood was the nations fourth most popular 
theme park last year drawing 42 million visitors the 500 
million universal studios florida is set to open in may 1990 with a 
combination of behindthescenes tours of moviemaking and thrill 
rides based on movies 
the foreign equation can work both ways a few leading 
programmers disney and nbc among them have begun spreading 
their franchises overseas so far though the advances have been 
tentative 
nonetheless said entertainment lawyer and film producer charles 
meeker i think youre going to see the successful us studios 
make major moves into foreign markets

the price of mca inc common stock climbed 
monday despite sony corps denial of a report that it was 
negotiating to acquire the entertainment giant 
sony is not negotiating with mca said jason farrow vice 
president for corporate communications at sonys offices in new 
jersey 
mca president sidney sheinberg has called the report a rumor 
nonetheless mca gained 387 a share to 5662 in trading 
monday on the new york stock exchange 
analysts said sony and mca were likely candidates for talks 
i think theres a relatively low probability of a merger i 
think that they have probably spoken to each other like sony has 
spoken to many many people on the street said harold vogel 
entertainment industry analyst for merrill lynch pierce fenner amp 
smith inc my best guess is that there will be nothing 
happening 
chris jones of the investment firm bateman eichler hill 
richards in los angeles said mca and sony were likely candidates 
for talks but warned that sony could have many interests in the 
mca conglomerate which includes movies music entertainment 
parks books and licensing 
but the sony style jones noted has been to move carefully 
i can tell you that their strategy has been one of building 
relationships with companies she said they had a 20year 
relationship with cbs before they acquired their music catalogue 
they are very methodical slow they are constantly 
reevaluating and have historically worked from longterm 
relationships in making acquisitions she said 
her firm estimates mca is worth just over 5 billion and well 
positioned as a major force in the entertainment industry 
meanwhile los angeles knxam newsradio stood by its story of 
friday that said a deal was in the works between the two corporate 
giants 
one aspect of any merger would be the likely need for the 
combination to dispense with mcas huge music catalog to avoid 
antitrust problems sony already owns cbs records with such 
artists as bruce springsteen and michael jackson and its huge 
library of recordings 
the mca catalog includes some of the bestknown artists in 20th 
century american music including duke ellington count basie 
woody herman the ink spots the mills brothers judy garland 
patsy cline bb king and buddy holly there is also the entire 
chess records rhythm and blues catalog including chuck berry bo 
diddley muddy waters and howlin wolf 
modern artists include elton john tiffany the boys new 
edition and country stars reba mcentire george strait lyle 
lovett lacy j dalton and the bellamy brothers

nissan motor manufacturing corp usa said 
monday it will spend 490 million on a plant expansion that will 
make it the largest single auto manufacturing plant in the nation 
and create 2000 jobs 
the company which is a subsidiary of nissan motor co ltd in 
tokyo plans to expand the 34millionsquarefoot plant by 12 
million square feet to make a new car line said jerry benefield 
president and chief operating officer of the company the expansion 
will boost nissans investment in tennessee to 12 billion 
today we are announcing an even greater presence in our 
community and in this great state benefield told a news 
conference at the plant located about 25 miles from nashville 
the company produces 240000 sentras and light trucks a year 
the production of the new car will boost the total output to 
440000 vehicles by 1992 
that will make us the largest automobile manufacturer in the 
united states in number of vehicles and size of the plant 
benefield said 
bert serre north american regional public affairs manager for 
ford motor co said ford does not have a single facility or 
complex that would produce that many vehicles 
we dont have a plant that would approach that were 
geographically distributed all across north america we dont 
believe in putting all our eggs in one basket he said 
a call was placed to general motors corp but it was not 
immediately returned 
details of the new car were kept secret except to say that it 
would be a fourdoor familysized car that would be pitched to the 
same market as the nissan stanza the cost of a 1989 stanza at a 
nearby nashville dealership ranged from 11500 to 17000 
for competitive reasons i wont tell you any more about it 
benefield said we wont discuss the power train the options or 
any part of the design 
the design for the cars styling is expected to be completed 
within a few weeks benefield said but design of the engine and 
other options wont be complete for up to 18 months 
it is a completely new car being designed with completely new 
styles and developed from scratch benefield said 
the new car is scheduled to roll off the line in the summer of 
1992 in time for the 1993 modelyear introduction 
the company which employs 3200 will hire 1750 production 
technicians and about 250 administrators beginning next year 
the company said it will spend 90 million on a training program 
and has asked the state to chip in 9 million for the program 
we have training money available in tennessee and naturally we 
will go to the legislature and discuss it with them said gov 
ned mcwherter who attended the news conference 
the nissan jobs which are highly sought pay 1150 to 1350 
per hour in addition to a base salary bonus of 145 per hour and 
other incentives benefield said worker satisfaction is high and it 
is unlikely that the united auto workers union which has tried to 
organize the plant before would take root 
our employees continue to tell us they are doing alright 
without the uaw i expect it to stay that way he said 
the company preferred to hire workers without previous 
carmaking experience he said therefore nissan would be unlikely 
to entice workers away from the uaworganized gm saturn plant 
which is expected to be operating by 1991 in nearby spring hill 
the president said

crude oil customers of the atlantic richfield 
co were warned monday that delivery schedules for alaskan crude 
might be delayed because the massive oil spill off valdez has 
slowed tanker shipments 
what we are telling our customers now is we cant meet every 
requirement in their contract arco spokesman albert greenstein 
said vessel delays at the port of valdez were blamed 
customers were told friday that deliveries may be prorated in 
the near future but we are not at that point yet said 
greenstein arco sells 50000 to 70000 barrels a day of alaskan 
crude oil 
arcos share of north slope oil is about 520000 barrels daily 
most of that processed in its own refineries 
earlier last week british petroleums bp america inc and the 
exxon corp said they had temporarily halted april alaskan crude 
oil contracts 
on monday exxon apologized for causing the nations biggest oil 
spill and promised to clean up every fouled beach in prince william 
sound but workers on those greasysmelling beaches said their 
efforts were futile 
the tanker exxon valdez crashed into bligh reef on march 24 
spilling 101 million gallons of north slope crude the oil slick 
has now grown larger than rhode island the nations smallest state 
at 1214 square miles

pratt hotel corp filed a civil 
racketeering suit monday against developer donald trump and 
penthouse magazine publisher robert c guccione in a continuing 
dispute over an unfinished casino project 
trump guccione and their corporate entities also were accused 
of civil conspiracy antitrust and fraud in the superior court 
lawsuit filed by pratt which alleged trump wanted the penthouse 
property to avoid increased competition for his rival trump plaza 
hotel and casino 
pratt had a contract to purchase the incomplete penthouse 
project and convert it into the sands hollywood casino but on 
march 19 trump made a surprise announcement that he purchased the 
penthouse site for 56 million and planned to convert it into a 
noncasino hotel 
trump consistently and vehemently opposed the development of 
the sands hollywood casino hotel project a competitor immediately 
next door to trumps major profitable asset in atlantic city 
pratt said in a prepared statement 
pratt seeks to void trumps contract with guccione and force 
penthouse international inc to honor the pratt contract it also 
asks for compensatory and punitive damages and asks that trumps 
casino license be revoked 
attorneys for the pratt trump and penthouse are scheduled to 
appear at a conference before superior court judge l anthony 
gibson on april 11 
pratt hotel officials said trump deliberately delayed the sands 
hollywood project with legal challenges and attempts to purchase 
parcels of land needed for the casinos parking facility 
pratt president william p weidner said monday that penthouse 
violated the terms of its contract with pratt by signing the deal 
with trump 
trump did everything he could both legally and illegally 
to ensure he did not have a competitor next door said roberto 
riverasoto attorney for pratt and guccione through his 
corporate entities did everything he could to either have us 
finance him or increase the value of his property at our expense 
trump on monday referred calls to his atlantic city attorney 
patrick t mcgahn jr who said the penthouse property was an open 
target after pratts extended option to buy expired feb 1 
it appears that the sands and pratt organizations may be 
merely trying to cover up their own negligence and that of their 
corporate officers and directors in failing to exercise the 
option mcgahn said said 
penthouse international spokeswoman leslie jay said monday the 
company would have no comment until officials reviewed the lawsuit 
in 1978 penthouse bought the 392room holiday inn on the 
boardwalk and the four seasons motel on pacific avenue and 
announced plans to link the two to create a casino hotel 
a steel superstructure was put in place to link the two 
buildings together but construction stopped when guccione ran out 
of money 
trump has said he intends to demolish the rusting framework but 
refurbish the holiday inn facility into a noncasino hotel 
connected to trump plaza the back section of the boardwalk 
property at first would become parking space but a luxury hotel 
would eventually be built on the site

the coast guard on monday reinstated 
daytimeonly restrictions on oil tanker traffic in prince william 
sound after state officials raised concerns spokesman rick meidt 
said 
night traffic was allowed sunday for the first time since the 
exxon valdez disaster but after a monday meeting the coast guard 
decided again to limit traffic until all agencies are satisfied 
that alyeska pipeline service co the operator of the valdez 
terminal has the equipment to handle another spill meidt said 
if something were to happen lets make sure we have enough 
gear there to respond he said 
the coast guard cut traffic in half through prince william sound 
after the valdez ran aground march 24 spilling more than 10 
million gallons of crude oil into the water 
valdez is the only port from which north slope oil is shipped 
the partial closure reduced north slope crude deliveries of 2 
million barrels a day to fewer than 1 million causing west coast 
refinery shortages and higher oil prices 
the coast guard said sunday that restrictions would remain in 
effect until the valdez was emptied of its remaining oil probably 
tuesday but the agency decided later sunday to lift the daylight 
restriction 
other restrictions such as allowing only one tanker at a time 
through the area and requiring an escort of two tug boats remain 
in effect 
meidt said valdez averages three tankers a day and with 
additional tug boats were not too far away from that

billionaire harold c simmons who may have 
lockheed corp in his takeover sights doesnt mind being called a 
corporate raider after all buying other companies has propelled 
the son of two texas public school teachers to billionaire status 
i think thats ok because thats what i am simmons told an 
interviewer last year i think that term raider is very 
misleading because it implies that somebody is taking something by 
force without paying for it basically corporate raiders are 
willing to pay a price for a stock higher that anyone else is 
willing to pay or else they dont buy it 
simmons 57 last week upped his stake in lockheed to 53 
percent but said in a letter to daniel m tellep chairman of the 
defense contractor we have no plans or desire to disrupt 
management we expect to be a constructive longterm shareholder 
however simmons has made no secret of his plans to get back 
into the acquisition game after he has digested his 1 billion 
purchase last year of nl industries inc 
ill be looking for an acquisition in the range of 2 billion 
and upwards simmons told the fort worth startelegram last year 
my philosophy has always been that a big deal is as easy to do as 
a small deal so you might as well do the biggest one you can do 
a philosophy he has repeated several times to various 
interviewers 
simmons a phi beta kappa graduate of the university of texas 
with bachelors and masters degrees in economics worked for three 
years as an investigator for the us civil service and then a 
year as an examiner at the federal deposit insurance corp 
then in 1956 he moved to republic national bank where he 
worked for four years before quitting according to his official 
biography because my bosses and i disagreed on who was the 
smarter 
simmons then 29 put down 5000 of his own money and borrowed 
95000 to buy a drug store across from the southern methodist 
university campus 
he has never worked for anyone else since says his 
biography 
he made hamburgers washed dishes stocked shelves kept books 
and polished the floors the bio says 
he also read financial statements i only know how to do one 
thing well and thats read a financial statement he said in an 
interview in the current issue of fortune magazine 
in 1966 he began acquiring drug store chains eventually owning 
100 stores before selling them in 1973 to jack eckerd corp for 50 
million 
fortune estimates his current holdings in chemical timber and 
sugar to be worth about 15 billion he told the magazine i 
expect to be worth 5 billion to 10 billion before i die 
besides nl industries which he split into a chemical division 
with 1 billion in 1988 sales and a petroleum services division 
with 492 in sales through his totally owned contran corp he 
controls all or most of the amalgamated sugar co with 1988 sales 
of 401 million medford corp 127 million in forest products 
medite corp 86 million in fiberboard sybra inc a large 
franchiser of arbys fast food restaurants with 81 million in 
sales and the hardware division which sold 59 million in locks 
and medical products 
separately through contran he owns 52 percent of keystone 
consolidated ind a steel and wire products company 
in addition simmons has made 3289 million over the past 
decade through the buying and selling of large chunks of companies 
from psa inc to sealand corp to gaf corp 
he has given some of it away the largest chunk a 41 million 
gift last year to the university of texas southwestern medical 
center at dallas for cancer and arthritis research 
along the way he also has had brushes with the law in the 
1970s he was acquitted of mail and securities fraud charges and 
settled a civil suit for 500000 
in 1983 he was found to have violated pension fund management 
rules even though he had increased the value of the pension fund 
although once described as working 80hour weeks simmons now 
spends only about six hours daily at his office on the 17th floor 
of a north dallas office building cant let my job get in the 
way of my tennis game he says 
im not a longhours worker he told a reporter last year 
two hours of good thinking time a day beats 20 hours of hard 
work from my viewpoint youve got to come up with the ideas 
simmons was born in alba texas east of dallas and grew up in 
nearby golden where his father was superintendent of schools and 
his mother a teacher in the town of about 200 
his official biography says simmons was 16 before his parents 
and two brothers lived in a house with indoor plumbing 
now simmons has two homes in dallas a duplex in aspen and a 
24acre villa in santa barbara about 80 miles from lockheeds 
calabasas calif headquarters so near simmons told lockheeds 
tellep he would come by for a visit someday soon

the citizens and southern corp parent 
corporation of georgias camps bank announced monday that its board 
has decided to fight an uninvited takeover attempt by the giant 
ncnb corp which would create the nations sixthlargest banking 
concern 
the atlantabased bank holding company in a statement termed 
the ncnb stock swap offer inadequate and said camps present 
management is better able to serve the banks customers 
shareholders and communities than ncnb 
we have managed this bank for service growth profitability 
and longterm service to shareholders not for a quick sale camps 
chairman and chief executive officer bennett a brown said the 
board of directors and the management have concluded that this 
offer is clearly inadequate and not in the best interests of camps 
shareholders customers and employees 
ncnb the southeasts largest banking company surprised camps 
late last thursday with a 24 billion stock offer for the 
atlantabased bank camps management was cool to the idea from the 
start 
it was unsolicited said camps chief financial officer james 
d dixon it was uninvited 
in a statement monday night ncnb corp called its offer fair 
and generous and said its legal advisers felt there is no 
regulatory block to such an acquisition 
we are determined to proceed and request the camps board to 
reconsider our offer and promptly authorize negotiations the 
release said 
in its official offer ncnb had told camps it wanted to begin 
active merger discussions within five business days that now 
is unlikely to happen 
camps board in addition to voting unanimously to reject the ncnb 
offer also decided in its meeting monday to adopt a new article in 
the corporations bylaws under georgias business combination act 
preventing any major shareholders from combining with the 
corporation for five years unless certain conditions are met 
the bid for camps followed a highly publicized push by the 
charlotte ncbased ncnb into texas last year buying into the 
republic bank corp of dallas a combined ncnb and camps would create 
a formidable bank with 76 billion in assets ncnb officials 
characterized their buyout offer as a friendly one and vowed to 
leave camps managers and its name in place in georgia 
under ncnbs plan each camps shareholder would bet 1075 shares 
of ncnb common stock for each of their camps shares

seven states will gain at least 135 
million as a result of a supreme court ruling monday that upholds a 
tax on oil company profits officials said 
the high court by an 80 vote upheld a new jersey tax that 13 
major oil companies said unfairly had cost them tens of millions of 
dollars 
the court said new jersey officials lawfully refused to allow 
state tax deductions for what the oil companies paid in federal 
windfall profit taxes 
the ruling also applied to six other states that refused to 
allow such deductions 
lawyers for the oil industry mining interests and natural gas 
producers had contended that a new jersey victory in the nations 
highest court could encourage other states to adopt similar tax 
systems 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said the state 
tax does not unduly interfere with interstate commerce 
the ruling was lauded by state officials and criticized by oil 
company representatives 
the outcome of the case was of particular interest in new 
jersey which included an anticipated 98 million windfall from the 
oil companies as revenues in its tight state budget for next year 
georgia stands to gain at least 25 million from oil companies 
as a result of the ruling said marcus collins commissioner of the 
state department of revenue 
south carolina officials said the ruling means the state wont 
have to pay out an estimated 10 million in refunds to the oil 
companies 
in minnesota the state will get at least 22 million from oil 
companies officials said 
officials from the other states affected by the ruling new 
york iowa and wisconsin said they did not know monday how much 
money will be coming in because of the ruling 
the federal windfall profits tax was imposed on oil retrieval 
after president carter announced he would gradually remove controls 
on domestic crude oil prices beginning in mid1979 
the windfall profits tax allowed the federal government to 
recover billions of dollars in increased profits the oil companies 
realized by the jump in oil prices resulting from decontrol 
the windfall tax which yielded more than 78 billion in federal 
revenue was repealed by congress last year but there may be some 
companies still paying on past earnings 
new jerseys corporate business tax imposes a levy on a portion 
of the entire net income of a corporation that does business in 
the state 
under the state tax formula a corporations net income is the 
same as its federal taxable income before net operating loss 
deduction and special deductions 
the state tax law also includes an addback provision that 
says entire net income shall be determined without the exclusion 
deduction or credit of taxes paid or accrued to the united 
states on or measured by profit or income 
the oil companies sought to avoid adding back the amount of 
their federal windfall profit taxes in effect claiming a 
deduction for that tax from its entire net income new jersey 
authorities disallowed such a deduction 
we conclude that the addback provision does not discriminate 
against interstate commerce blackmun said 
were disappointed with the ruling said james benton 
executive director of the new jersey petroleum council we 
believed that a state such as new jersey which has no oil 
production could not impose such a corporate business tax 
benton said oil companies will promptly pay the balance owed new 
jersey

atlantic richfield co conoco inc citgo petroleum corp exxon 
corp phillips petroleum co chevron corp mobil corp unocal 
corp gulf a division of chevron shell oil co tenneco inc 
and texaco inc
