the ghost of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
stalks the islamic republic a year after his death in the form of 
a power struggle among the imams disciples that remains unresolved 
the revolution khomeini began 11 years ago surviveshowever 
frustrating the doomsayers who predicted it would fall apart when 
he was no longer there to unite the factions 
moves by president hashemi rafsanjani and his pragmatists 
toward a more liberal course have been stymied by antiwestern 
radicals who accuse him of straying from the path of the imam 
as khomeini was known 
both groups claim to be khomeinis true ideological heirs and 
invoke his commandments to justify their actions 
an iranian official speaking anonymously said rafsanjani 
sought to legitimize his more liberal policies through subtle 
interpretations of khomeinis teachings 
in response the 270member parliament passed a law in may that 
makes changing khomeinis writings a crime the parliament is 
dominated by radical followers of ali akbar mohtashemi a former 
interior minister 
the radicals include ahmad khomeini 44 the ayatollahs only 
surviving son he has made no apparent effort to claim his fathers 
mantle and is overshadowed by mohtashemi 
in a clear warning to rafsanjani ahmad khomeini recently told 
the 350000strong revolutionary guards corps which could hold the 
balance of power do not deviate from the imams path if others 
do i trust you will not let them 
during the revolution the revolutionary guards swore personal 
allegiance to ayatollah khomeini 
rafsanjani elected in july 1989 to a presidency with greater 
power than before is trying to revitalize the economy after a 
decade of inefficient management and eight years of war with iraq 
that ended in august 1988 
included in his 5year reconstruction plan is 27 billion of 
foreign investment to rebuild industry 
radicals fear rafsanjanis policy of improving relations with 
the west to obtain investment and technology will lead to renewed 
relations with the united states which khomeini called the great 
satan 
the presidents influence is believed to have been critical to 
the release of two american hostages in april by proiranian 
shiites in lebanon 
mohtashemi who has close ties to lebanese shiite militants 
denounced the releases and 170 members of the parliament signed a 
protest demanding the government not involve itself in the hostage 
issue 
diplomats in tehran say rafsanjani appears determined to show 
the west he is moving the country away from isolation 
in an effort to create a more liberal social and political 
climate he has eased restrictions khomeini placed on irans 55 
million people he cannot move quickly because of radical 
opposition and faces growing discontent from a populace whose 
expectations were raised when he gained power 
there have been demonstrations against shortages unemployment 
estimated at 4 million and high inflation opposition groups say 
the revolutionary guards killed several protesters and arrested 
scores 
some progress has been made diplomats estimate inflation was 
trimmed from 30 percent to 20 percent in the past year and the 
government has contracts for major investment projects estimated to 
be worth billions of dollars 
rafsanjanis plans depend on oil revenue it is expected to be 
about 15 billion this year but nothing is certain in the volatile 
oil market 
the authorities know they have at best one or two years grace 
before economic problems produce dangerous political 
dissatisfaction vahe petrossian an iranian analyst based in 
london wrote last month in the middle east economic digest 
a waiter named khosrow in a tehran restaurant said all i want 
are three square meals a day for myself and my family someone has 
to rule but i dont really care who it is so long as i have enough 
to provide a roof for my family 
during the war i never complained but enough is enough 
mehrdad a taxi driver said i think most of the people are 
behind rafsanjani and they know hes trying to do something good 
for us 
asked if restoring relations with the united states did not go 
against khomeinis teachings he replied 
the imam said we must strike a blow against the united states 
how are we hurting the united states when we pay triple the price 
for american goods because we buy them through middlemen 
we would strike a more effective blow if we resumed ties and 
rebuilt our economy and industry so we become truly independent and 
powerful

the fouryear drought has parched the 
countryside thats home to nearly a third of californians into a 
tinderbox the likes of which has not been seen this century fire 
officials say 
worse there have never been so many homes in the fastgrowing 
rural areas where few residents take enough safety measures to 
protect their property or themselves 
fire officials delivered a prophetic assessment of the states 
fire risk on tuesday the day before wildfires ignited by arsonists 
began destroying hundreds of homes in southern california 
our experience tells us that this year the stage is set for 
possibly having fires of disastrous proportions said dave mack 
of the california department of forestry and fire protection 
on thursday fire agencies from throughout the state shifted 
their forces to the south leaving fireprone northern california 
with fewer forces to respond to blazes there 
the southern california fires the worst of which was in santa 
barbara county conformed ominously to the forecast issued tuesday 
by an unprecedented task force of statewide fire agencies 
the task force announced new strategies for the summer 
including hitting wildfires faster with larger forces than during 
the past three drought years 
pat kidder of the us bureau of land management said that all 
the indicators show we could have the potential for the worst fire 
season on record this century 
one indicator during this fourth and driest year of the drought 
the palmer index shows that its drier than any time this 
century on a statewide average said state forestry spokeswoman 
karen terrill 
the palmer index which employs mathematical formulas to 
examine rainfall soil moisture humidity and other conditions 
indicates that conditions are drier than those in 1924 when more 
than a million acres burned and in 1987 when more than 800000 
acres were charred 
fire experts said other longtime indicators of fire danger such 
as those which measure moisture in live and dead vegetation appear 
to support those conclusions 
they also said the drought is killing forests and brush 
there are an estimated 1 billion board feet of dead timber 
standing on public and private lands with another 1 billion board 
feet expected to die by the end of the year said us forest 
service spokesman matt mathes a board foot is a piece of wood that 
is 1 foot square and 1 inch thick 
in certain areas some scientists believe one out of every 
three trees is dead or dying victims of the drought or the 
resulting disease and beetle infestation 
at the same time up to 50 tons per acre of dead branches in 
same areas litter the countryside sheared from trees by a 
particularly heavy winter storm together the dead trees and 
branches could fuel especially hot swift fires 
in addition abovenormal temperatures are forecast throughout 
much of the summer 
reacting to the threat local state and federal fire agencies 
formed the task force to assess drought conditions budget needs 
and firefighting strategies 
fire officials said that in some particularly endangered areas 
they will send more ground and air forces to fires as soon as they 
break out 
but they acknowledged that they will be running a calculated 
risk because that will pull firefighters out of other areas that 
in turn could catch fire

the presidents of latin americas three biggest debtor nations 
all hailed president bushs proposal to forgive billions of dollars 
of latin american countries foreign debt 
bushs plan to forgive part of the 12 billion owed by latin 
american and caribbean nations to the us government was welcomed 
too by the head of the biggest american creditor bank 
latin american leaders also praised bushs announcement 
wednesday that the united states would work with western european 
nations and japan to channel up to 300 million annually to latin 
america to spur foreign investment 
bush urged that work begin on a hemispherewide free trade 
zone but this was received more cautiously by some latin 
american governments 
latin american experts noted that bushs proposal affects only a 
small part of latin americas total foreign debt of more than 400 
billion 
brazilian president fernando collor de mello told bush in a 
telephone call that his proposal was comprehensive bold and 
innovative brazils foreign debt of 114 billion is the biggest 
among developing nations 
a spokesman for mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
the third worlds secondbiggest debtor at 93 billion said 
salinas considered bushs speech a very important redefinition of 
the us position regarding economic development in latin america 
president carlos saul menem of argentina said he was 
satisfied with bushs speech argentinas foreign debt of 66 
billion ranks third in latin america 
menems spokesman humberto toledo said bushs statements showed 
that the united states was not going to overlook the problems of 
latin america because of changes in eastern europe where formerly 
communist nations also are seeking aid from the west 
however argentine economy minister antonio erman gonzalez said 
bushs plan for a hemispherewide common market is not for the 
immediate future it is a look at the medium and longterm 
john reed president of citicorp a large us commercial bank 
that has 8 billion in loans to latin america said he welcomed 
bushs initiative as a way to bring economic growth and prosperity 
to the region 
reed said bushs proposal would meet the objections of 
commercial banks to the us governments third world debt plan 
outlined last year by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
bradys plan offered incentives for commercial banks to write 
off some of their 13 trillion in third world debt but did not 
address the debt owed to the governments of the united states and 
other industrial nations 
commercial banks had argued they were being forced to shoulder 
the entire burden of debt reduction 
american officials said smaller countries such as honduras el 
salvador and jamaica would benefit the most from bushs debt 
forgiveness plan because a higher percentage of their foreign debt 
was to the us government 
honduran president rafael callejas called bushs announcement 
encouraging news 
officials said the united states would propose substantial 
writeoffs in the 7 billion in aid loans that us government 
agencies have made at belowmarket interest rates to the most 
heavily burdened countries 
the amount of debt forgiveness would depend on each countrys 
willingness to undertake economic reforms under the supervision of 
the international monetary fund 
the officials said the united states will also sell a portion of 
its 5 billion in marketrate loans to help facilitate 
debtforequity and debtfornature swaps 
bush said some of the us government debt could be swapped to 
set aside environmentally endangered land

neighbors along via las padres 
consoled one another and surveyed the embers and ash that remained 
of their homes thursday after fire swept down from the mountains 
and burned everything in its path 
it was a beautiful neighborhood eric lim said as the 
remains of his house steamed behind him it was a great place to 
grow up 
the 4000acre brushfire that started wednesday night cut a 
vicious swath through the suburban foothills of this coastal city 
leveling entire neighborhoods 
few areas were harder hit than park highlands a tightly knit 
enclave of 750000 homes about 5 miles northwest of the city with 
dramatic views of the coast below eighteen of 19 homes on one 
block of via las padres were wholly consumed by flames 
lawns burned as though made of straw and shrubbery and trees 
parched from a 4yearlong drought ignited like matches the 
intense heat left a pool slide in one yard melted on its frame like 
a giant marshmallow 
the fire is incredible it came down from the mountains it 
spread everywhere it burned everything in its path said tim 
grasey spokesman for the santa barbara county sheriffs department 
the fire destroyed 567 homes and other buildings in santa 
barbara county county supervisor bill wallace said the homes alone 
were worth 190 million ninetyone homes were ravaged elsewhere in 
the region 
i started reading the paper after i came home from work and 
then my 12yearold said daddy the back yard is on fire said 
bryan gaggs whose home was untouched while those of two of his 
nearest neighbors were gutted 
the lims lost their home of 14 years salvaging only a few 
personal effects and their cats across the street the harveys 
stirred the ashes of what was once their dream home filled with 
antiques and personal mementos 
i cant find anything theres nothing nancy harvey said as 
she picked through what was once her kitchen im hoping to find 
my address book 
her daughter tiffany poked around the spot in the living room 
where the familys television set had stood im looking from my 
necklace she told her mother i left it here last night 
don anderson who lives next to the lims said he stayed on his 
roof with a hose in hand until the heat and smoke became 
intolerable 
i stood up there and for a while i though we were going to be 
ok that we would be at the bottom of the fire and that it would 
miss us he said 
and then it suddenly got very smoky and i yelled back to the 
lims can you see the flames when he said yes i knew it was 
time to go 
andersons home was leveled the skeletal remains of a jacuzzi 
tub were the only signs of a recent 250000 remodeling job 
i think the water shortage definitely contributed to this 
fire said dale hanst whose house survived if people had been 
able to water their foliage a lot of the homes would have been 
saved 
while some families wept hopelessly over their losses others 
kept their sense of humor 
nancy harvey said she was confident that valuables in the family 
safe were unharmed but i had the combination for it written in 
the bottom of my desk drawer she said with a laugh

the two german states on sunday take their 
biggest step toward ending the four decades of division imposed 
after world war ii once again sharing a common currency and 
economy 
they will also share uncertainty over everything from a united 
germanys military role to their new nations name east germans 
worry about their jobs west germans wonder if their eastern 
cousins remember how to work 
many germans are still stunned by the pace of change since the 
ouster of east german communist leader erich honecker last october 
his downfall ended 40 years of ironfisted stalinist rule that 
followed the war 
merging the two nations without skipping too many beats in west 
germanys mighty economic rhythm is going to be difficult 
even theo waigel the passionately prounification finance 
minister in bonn has acknowledged that germany is embarking on an 
economic adventure 
in one stroke sunday most east germans will get thousands of 
dollars worth of west german marks which will become the common 
currency for both sides 
the west german mark will replace the virtually worthless east 
german currency and staterun businesses in east germany will be 
forced to compete for customers to survive 
there are countless scenarios of what might happen between 
sunday and early december when bonn hopes to see full unification 
completed 
depending on who is talking unemployment in east germany could 
hit several hundred thousand 4 million or almost anywhere in 
between 
unrest and disturbances are possible some experts say as east 
germans come back from their newly affordable summer vactions in 
venice mallorca and elsewhere to find they have no jobs 
others see inflation topping 10 percent or nearly three times 
its current pace 
in berlin and at other points along the rapidly disappearing 
border between east and west germans are eager to talk about their 
concerns 
basically we are happy says wilfriede dybowski of east 
berlin but we dont know whats going to happen to our jobs or 
whether we can face up to the new competition were pretty 
worried 
ms dybowski works for deutsche schallplatten gmbh a company 
that makes and assembles compact discs and records like thousands 
of east german businesses it must get rid of the countrys own 
products to make way for western goods 
we also have to cut the number of workers to the minimum 
possible said the smiling 55yearold ms dybowski we hope 
to stay in business 
just 100 yards away from ms dybowski on the western side of the 
berlin wall an elderly west berlin man gave a gloomy assessment 
the east germans have forgotten how to work said hubert 
enzenross 70 and my pension wont be going up that much all 
the money has to go over there to the east 
enzenross added its good that communism has fallen as for 
the rest its just not clear 
the berlin native stood in the shadow of the reichstag the 
imposing historyladen parliament building that could one day 
become the seat of the new countrys legislature 
the euphoria over the crumbling of the berlin wall last fall has 
been replaced by a sober realization that unification will cause 
discomfort in the short term 
still virtually everyone agrees the bold experiment will pay 
off in the long run 
we are hammering berlin back together has become the citys 
motto 
that saying is both figurative and literal as work crews rejoin 
pipes wires subway lines and other vital links hacked asunder in 
1961 
along the borders between the two countries the once 
impenetrable communist fences and walls are being hauled into the 
scrapheap of history as quickly as crews can work 
pedestrians and passenger cars at many points cross freely back 
and forth as bored east german guards stroll around or listen to 
the latest western rock music on the radio 
thousands of details remain to be worked out in the coming 
months ranging from placating soviet objections to nato membership 
for the joined country to meshing the two legal systems 
west berlin mayor walter momper infuriated many by proposing 
that west germany adopt some east german laws specifically a 
highway speed limit and a ban on drinking and driving 
it is uncertain what the new nation with nearly 80 million 
people will be called 
some have objected to the single name deutschland or 
germany saying it would call to mind too many memories of the 
samenamed country that unleashed nazi terror on europe

currencies you know which one is more important 
west german bills are bigger and west german coins are better 
than their flimsy soontobeextinct counterparts across the 
border 
take the 10mark bill 
worth about 6 the 5inch by 25inch western edition is 
illustrated with a curly haired anonymous renaissance figure on 
its back theres a historic sailing ship

narrower and slightly shorter and has a portrait of clara zetkin 
a communist figure from the 1920s 
the rear side shows a young woman wearing a white laboratory 
coat and glaring at a battery of dials and buttons that could be 
straight out of a bad science fiction movie 
presumably she symbolizes science 
like other eastern european currencies most east german coins 
are made of featherweight aluminium prompting a giggle from most 
western visitors 
by coincidence the west german central bank is issuing a new 
100mark bill worth about 6060 which shows the city of leipzig 
now in east germany the bill will come into circulation on oct 1 
but had been planned long before the july 1 currency union was 
announced according to the bank

soldiers clad in black tshirts 
reading we kill for peace lounge near a buddhist temple 
smoking cigarettes and cracking jokes their automatic weapons lean 
against a nearby wall 
shops and offices on the towns narrow main street are boarded 
up and deserted a sole army jeeps speeds along the road 
welcome to vavuniya one of hundreds of cities left ghost towns 
by a 7yearold civil war 
more than 450000 people have fled the countrys northern and 
eastern sectors since a resurgence of fighting june 11 between 
militant tamil separatists and government troops 
at least 1679 combatants have been killed since the fighting 
broke out including civilians killed during government raids on 
rebel hideouts the government acknowledged it killed civilians 
during such raids this week on the city of jaffna 
vavuniya 135 miles northeast of colombo is the first northern 
settlement on the road to the jaffna peninsula a stronghold of 
tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland 
rebels seized vavuniya shortly after they began overrunning 
police stations and attacking military camps june 11 
government troops counterattacked five days later recapturing 
the town after a battle in which nine soldiers and at least 67 
rebels were reported killed twelve civilians also died in the 
fighting 
since then the town which once had 18000 residents has 
emptied most people have gone to distant villages to live with 
relatives 
we cleared the town of people and have sealed off the three 
main entrances after recapturing the area said brig sathis 
jayasuriya army chief in vavuniya 
but the rebels are still capable of laying ambushes on the 
outskirts of the town he added 
the fight for vavuniya is typical of combat ravaging hundreds of 
villages which has left hundreds of thousands of people homeless 
after taking vavuniya tamil rebels built sandbagged bunkers on 
the streets and painted colorful pictures of dead comrades on 
building walls 
now vavuniya is occupied by government troops who man posts at 
three strategic junctions at one a government soldier draped a 
belt of machinegun bullets around his neck 
we have to be extremely careful since it is easy for the 
rebels to gain access to the town and attack civilian targets 
with bombs the soldier said 
on tuesday rebels ambushed and killed five soldiers on a road 
clearing operation at madukanda village north of vavuniya 
we have learned from our past mistakes and are now capable of 
destroying the rebels said a young colonel parami kulatunga 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people the 
rebels claim they are discriminated against by the majority 
sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population 
in vavuniya long considered rebel country nearly 80 percent of 
the population was tamil the rest were sinhalese and moslem 
the tamil tigers have to be destroyed said kirith 
seneviratne a sinhalese clerk who fled vavuniya for a refugee 
camp both communities have lived together for so many years but 
now it is a case of finishing them off

fearing pickets on the links a veterans 
of foreign wars post lifted a policy banning women from its golf 
course before 11 am on weekends and holidays 
the hickory vfw golf course adopted the policy after its 
nineman governing board claimed women play too slowly during the 
prime hours for duffers 
at least one woman who plays the course frequently protested the 
policy spawning publicity that drew television crews telephone 
calls and letters 
course manager don wilson defended the policy but decided to 
change it thursday when some players threatened to picket the 
course this saturday 
with the letters im getting and the statements im getting 
from some of the men i dont want to see those two groups get 
together he said if somebody got hurt out here i would take 
it personally 
he had said the nowomen policy was designed to enable more 
people to play on the course at peak times keeping costs down

the people of washington have now seen over 
and over their mayor on television acting very unmayorlike 
marion barry is in a hotel room with a beautiful woman in 
shirtsleeves engaging in the government says a criminal act 
smoking crack cocaine 
the videotape picture is from the three hidden cameras used in 
an fbi sting operation the picture is fuzzy the jurors will have 
to decide what it proves 
but the mayor already has admitted he smoked crack in the vista 
international hotel on the evening of jan 18 with exmodel 
rasheeda moore she is the magazine covergirl and mayoral 
girlfriend who cooperated with the fbi in setting up the sting 
on the tape the smoking is quick and perfunctory a puff or 
two the mayor prepares to leave and the police burst in 
fbi fbi they shout running past the secret cameras 
youre under arrest 
but the high drama comes in the mayors reaction he knows he is 
trapped but he cant accept it 
he curses his fate he curses moore he curses the situation 
ill be god damned he says she set me up 
he says it over and over 
barry 54 is in his third term before that he served on the 
city school board the son of a sharecropper he was a civil rights 
activist in the 1960s he used to wear a dashiki around town 
he once lectured a welfare mother for having too many children 
until his arrest he lectured schoolchildren about drugs 
dubbed mayor for life by a local alternative weekly 
newspaper city paper barry seemed unbeatable 
now he is on trial charged with perjury and drug possession he 
has pleaded innocent and renounced reelection plans 
there had been rumors for years about his personal life they 
were given substance by the tape played over and over on local 
stations from the moment it became evidence at his trial thursday 
afternoon 
he asks moore can we make love before you leave before you 
leave town it would be a good idea just for old time sake you 
know catch up 
she spurns him 
they are on the bed he is in a suit minus jacket and she is 
wearing billowing pants and a silky jacket 
he asks i cant caress your breast 
she changes the subject 
moore has testified that their romancing and their use of drugs 
started in 1986 she said they used drugs together at least 100 
times in 22 different places she once delivered drugs to him in 
his office she said 
on the tape they drink cognac he paces he sits on the bed he 
preens before a mirror he gives her some money for wanda an 
fbi plant to make a purchase when wanda delivers they argue 
over who will fill the crack pipe 
you do it he says no you do it she says 
he does it the pipe is smoked barry puts on his jacket to 
leave and the lawmen have seen enough they break in moore is 
hustled out of there 
the mayor knows whats up that was a good setup wasnt it 
he says 
he is told to put his arms against the wall he complies his 
situation sinks in 
i shouldnt have come up here he says ill be damned 
howd i get tricked into this stuff 
an agent reads him his rights but barry pays no heed he is 
still establishing the dimensions of his dilemma 
that was a setup he says 
you have the right to remain silent says the agent 
ill be god damned says the mayor 
you also have the right to stop answering 
bitch set me up 
at any time until you talk to a lawyer 
she set me up 
the fbi worries about its suspects health he has a history of 
heart trouble he lets medical technicians take his blood pressure 
monitor his heart check his vital signs 
he curses i shouldnt have come up here 
the lawmen call him mr mayor they explain they will 
provide a maximum of decorum under the circumstances 
were not going to parade you through the lobby an agent 
says 
the fbi he says will provide cars with blackedout windows 
barry will be booked and brought before a judge and will not have 
to spend the night in jail 
he is not listening he has one thing on his mind 
i should have stayed downstairs he says god damn

what was a national embarrasment three 
centuries ago a warship that sank 15 minutes into its maiden 
voyage is now prominently displayed in a new museum 
the dockside museum opened this month to display the vasa which 
capsized in stockholm harbor in 1628 killing about 50 of the 
dignitaries and sailors on board 
the 200footlong warship bore the family name of king gustavus 
ii adolphus who had ordered it built to support his military 
campaigns in eastern europe 
nobody dared tell gustavus eager to get the vessel into action 
that it was dangerously unsteady a test involving 30 men running 
from side to side across the vasas deck was halted when it 
appeared that one more run would tip her over 
it took only a puff of wind to capsize the vasa barely a mile 
from where it was launched it sank in 110 feet of water and 
remained there until 1961 when it was raised and placed in an 
aluminum shed 
now in the 35 million museum tourists can use computer 
simulations to try to make the vasa seaworthy 
using computer screens museumgoers can add ballast remove 
guns and change the boats dimensions using mathematical formulas 
the computers tell visitors whether their redesigned boat will 
float and whether the king would have been satisfied 
two years and 1000 oak trees were invested in the vasa the 
ships commanders simply loaded 64 heavy cannons on board hoisted 
sail and hoped for the best 
shipbuilding was not an exact science in those days and there 
are several possible reasons why the vasa turned out badly even 
though it was neither larger than other ships of the period nor of 
a radically different design 
one of the factors might have been the death during the project 
of the dutch shipbulder who supervised the job another may have 
been an order by gustavus to add a second gun deck thus making the 
vasa unusually topheavy 
a royal inquiry found no one guilty in the ships sinking the 
court could not determine whether the vasa was too narrow below the 
waterline too heavy above it or whether it needed more ballast to 
make it sail upright 
the new museum tells the story with slides and ship models 
frescoes and fullsize human carvings recall intellectual and 
political themes of the 17th century and give the flavor of life 
in old stockholm 
some visitors have criticized the building which they say is as 
poorly designed as the vasa the museum resembles a copperclad 
barn with masts inside some exhibits are dimly lit and some 
explanatory labels are placed at kneelevel 
but the museum allows visitors to see the vasa close up from 
all sides and on several levels 
the ship came largely intact from its centuries in the mud 
because the baltic seas water has little salt and woodeating 
marine worms dont live there 
its oncegaudily painted hull is blackened but hundreds of 
sculptures that adorned her stern and upper decks survived in 
remarkable detail 
objects recovered from the vasa on view include sailors 
clothes tools and games visitors can walk through a replica of 
the upper gun deck and examine a 23footlong model of the vasa 
which took 13000 hours to build and shows the 20000 nails used in 
the original 
swedish engineer anders franzen an amateur marine archeologist 
found the vasa in 1956 the vessel was raised five years later and 
placed until two years ago in a temporary aluminum shed visited by 
more than 11 million people

a videotape showing marion barry smoking crack 
cocaine gives defense lawyers plenty of grist but little compelling 
evidence to argue that the mayor was entrapped by the fbi 
the tape played thursday for jurors at the mayors drug and 
perjury trial in us district court shows barry taking a 
makeshift pipe putting it to his mouth and inhaling the smoke of 
burning crack cocaine 
barry takes a second hit on the pipe and puts on his suit 
jacket before fbi agents and police storm into the downtown hotel 
room to arrest him 
r kenneth mundy barrys chief defense lawyer has argued that 
the mayor was an inexperienced drug user who was lured to the hotel 
room by a former girlfriend rasheeda moore 
the former model testified that barry was reluctant to come up 
to her room at the vista international hotel in a recorded 
telephone call the mayor said there are too many nosy rosies 
around 
this and other comments by the mayor before he smokes the crack 
will undoubtedly be cited by mundy to try to convince jurors that 
barry was pressured into doing something he didnt want to do 
the videotaped conversation between barry and moore gives mundy 
some basis for this argument 
but it also contains statements from barry that prosecutors can 
cite to argue that the mayor was an experienced drug user who 
willingly purchased and smoked the illegal drug 
for instance barry alludes to prior drug use saying at one 
point i dont smoke no more honey at another point he tells 
her go get some go get it 
at another the mayor asks moore if she has a pipe to smoke the 
crack 
the mayor voices reluctance to smoke the cocaine unless moore 
joined in but moore spurns his repeated requests saying it 
makes me too hyper i get really hyper 
if you dont do it im not going to do it the mayor says 
richard benveniste a washington defense attorney said mundy 
can highlight the means under which the recorded portion of the 
evidence was set up 
you can point to the fact that the government brought the 
witness here to be used as a decoy paid for her bills at the 
beauty parlor babysat her children to help the fbi catch the 
mayor he said 
in this case i think there is substantial ammunition if you 
are dealing only with that incident benveniste said 
but the law of entrapment requires the defendant to show that he 
would not have performed the illegal act unless pressured by the 
police 
moore has testified that she and the mayor used cocaine more 
than 100 times on previous occasions convicted drug dealer charles 
lewis recounted a series of episodes of cocaine use with barry 
the amount of information that has been brought forward is 
staggering in terms of the extent of drug use that is now alleged 
by witnesses under oath benveniste said 
it certainly helps them prosecutors rebut any argument of 
entrapment on the basis of disposition he said 
joseph digenova a former us attorney who investigated barry 
for many years without bringing any charges said the tape doesnt 
help the entrapment argument 
he gave her money for the drugs he waited for the drugs he 
never said during the entire time i dont do drugs or take 
those away digenova said 
she didnt force it on him the former prosecutor said he 
goes over and picks up the pipe and lights it himself 
even though barry tried in vain to persuade moore to take the 
pipe first he didnt walk out he didnt say i wont use it 
digenova said 
she decided not to so he went first 
its very interesting he never puts his coat on to leave 
until he takes the second hit of the cocaine digenova said 
then he puts the coat on thats the image that the jury is 
going to remember

of all the places to go on the fourth of july 
its london that president bush heads for while americans at home 
pack their picnic baskets and take to the park to watch the 
fireworks 
london is where george iii operated and if you believe what 
they told you in the sixth grade gave the orders oppressing the 
american colonists until they threw him overboard along with the 
tea and formed these united states 
bush who raised flagwaving to a campaign issue in 1988 is not 
the sort to forget such patriotic events as independence day but 
the celebration he will attend on july 56 in london is of an 
entirely different sort 
after 41 years of nuclear standoff and tensions the cold war 
struggle with the soviet union is over all that remains of the 
berlin wall is a cold slab that symbolizes the past but no longer 
blocks transit from east to west last week the sentry post 
checkpoint charlie was hauled away 
the warsaw pact is disintegrating east germany is on the brink 
of absorption into west germany while some soviet troops may 
remain on east german soil for a transitional period the new and 
larger germany appears headed for nato membership 
the soviets are trying to delay the process while also appealing 
to the western allies to withdraw all foreign forces from germany 
the strategy is not succeeding even though russians are not the 
only people in europe worried about german resurgence 
the western leaders concluded the best insurance is nato 
membership for germany and letting the germans decide whether they 
want western troops on their territory 
hungary is heading for the exit too leaving the sovietled 
warsaw pact with a future that could be brief without two of its 
seven members and some of the others fitfully restive the 
alliance is dwindling into an inconsequential state 
bush and his summit partners no doubt will toast their victory 
with perhaps a bit of gloating the phrase europe whole and 
free already a cliche will resonate throughout the twoday 
london summit meeting with just a proper amount of mournful 
warnings that the soviets still have 5 million men under arms and 
an arsenal of 25000 nuclear weapons 
the american president and his partners will talk about 
reshaping nato trying to find a way to keep the western alliance 
in business even after its principal task containing the soviet 
union may soon be academic 
much will be said about two key nato doctrines flexible 
response and forward basing the first refers to deploying nuclear 
weapons in europe along with conventional arms and threatening to 
use them the second refers to the strategic commitment to defend 
the west german border with east germany 
the nuclear threat is supposed to offset the warsaw pacts 
advantage in nonnuclear forces there are 398000 american 
british french belgian canadian and dutch soldiers in west 
germany 18000 more than the 380000 the soviets have in east 
germany but the warsaw pact has an advantage of about 2 to 1 in 
tanks and artillery 
most of the soviet troops will leave either under the pressure 
of german unification or through a treaty being negotiated between 
nato and the warsaw pact in vienna so will a lot of tanks and 
artillery pieces 
the question facing bush prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain president francois mitterrand of france and the other 
allied leaders is whether to revise nato doctrine and remove or at 
least play down the nuclear threat 
as for nato strategy it obviously no longer makes sense to make 
plans to defend a border between east and west germany that will 
soon disappear 
but those are the kinds of tough questions that will take a long 
time to answer right now celebration is the order of the day

president bush is spending a long holiday 
weekend at his maine vacation home to enjoy some recreation and 
bone up for a busy week of meetings with international allies 
bush was flying today to the resort town of kennebunkport 
maine where he vacations every summer at his familys oceanfront 
home on walkers point 
the president had no business scheduled for the weekend but he 
will be joined by defense secretary dick cheney and other advisers 
from washington on monday for strategy sessions before next weeks 
nato summit in london and the economic summit of seven 
industrialized nations in houston beginning july 9 
cheney and bush are expected to discuss among other things the 
eastwest conventional force reduction talks in vienna and the 
alliances response to the dramatic changes that have swept the 
soviet bloc 
national security adviser brent scowcroft was accompanying bush 
to maine for the full six days there scowcroft frequently serves 
as a golf partner for the president during kennebunkport vacations 
bush this weekend also was expected to engage in his usual 
smorgasbord of fishing running tennis swimming and racing around 
in his speedboat fidelity 
the president will fly from kennebunkport to london on wednesday 
evening july 4 and from london to houston on friday on that 
saturday july 7 he is expected to meet with japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu in advance of the meetings with the other 
economic summit partners 
secretary of state james a baker iii said thursday that bush 
likely will ask the nato allies to issue a declaration that they do 
not pose a threat to nations of the warsaw pact 
the declaration would be intended to calm moscows anxieties 
about a united germany being a military and political member of the 
16member nato alliance 
looming for likely discussion in both london and houston is the 
suggestion by some allies that a package of economic aid be 
presented to the soviet union to help its ravaged economy 
but baker told reporters it is premature for the united states 
to give cash aid to the soviet union 
instead he suggested that the economic summit nations consider 
guidelines for financial assistance for moscow 
western european leaders on wednesday agreed in principle to aid 
moscow but have not considered specific proposals or amounts and 
some analysts have suggested trading such aid for soviet military 
cutbacks 
west germany already is guaranteeing loans to the soviet union

a strong demand for cattle hides used to make 
shoes in several east asian countries has translated into extra 
money for us beef producers according to agriculture department 
economists 
its a package deal though because hides are simply the 
outside wrappers for cattle and its what inside that counts most 
for american beef eaters and producers 
for example according to analysts in the departments economic 
research service if an 1100pound steer sold for 70 per 100 
pounds of live weight it brought its owner 770 
as a rule of thumb the hide is worth about 1 per pound with 
its weight at around 55 pounds on the average so 55 of the 770 
would be for the hide 
when cattle go to the packing plant they are paid for on the 
basis of live weight that is what the farmer rancher or feedlot 
operator is paid as owner of the animals 
the packer kills and separates various parts including the red 
meat for consumers tallow hides and other offal 
economist larry duewer said that as of june 9 the offal value in 
a typical slaughter steer averaged about 850 per 100 pounds of 
the animals live weight that included the hide 
if cattle are selling for 70 per hundredweight 850 of 
that is the hide and offal value and i think at least half of that 
850 is hides duewer said thursday in a telephone interview 
the producer is paid on the basis of the live weight of the 
whole animal consumers however buy only the edible parts of 
cattle which are segregated by the packer from the offal and have 
their own prices 
thus duewer said higher prices for hides are not supposed to 
be linked with the cost of red meat at the supermarket but the 
hide market is important to the cattle producer 
it definitely gives him more money and technically it 
shouldnt affect the price of beef for consumers he said 
christine bolling another usda economist says the american 
demand for highpriced sports shoes has helped buoy the hide 
market particularly exports to south korea and taiwan 
those countries import the hides make them into shoes and ship 
them back to the united states these are quality athletic footwear 
selling for 50 and up 
south korea second only to italy as a shoe exporter shipped 
more than 150 million pairs valued at 23 billion to the united 
states in 1988 compared with 25 million pairs in 1982 bolling 
said in the july issue of farmline magazine 
taiwan shipped 120 million pairs of leather shoes to the united 
states in 1988 those had an export value of 14 billion 
japan is the third major importer of us cattle hides among the 
asian nations but its footwear emphasis differs from that of south 
korea and taiwan since it focuses on meeting domestic footwear 
needs 
with rising per capita disposable incomes the japanese are 
demanding more upscale products like leather shoes bolling 
said

a new survey by the agriculture department 
shows corn farmers have planted 746 million acres for 1990 
production up 3 percent from last years 723 million acres 
the new plantings figures announced thursday were down only 
fractionally from 748 million acres of corn indicated in a march 
survey of farmers despite delays in some areas because of wet 
weather 
soybean plantings were estimated at 58 million acres down 4 
percent from 1989 the report said and that was down from the 594 
million acres of beans farmers had indicated in the march survey 
cotton plantings at 124 million acres are up 17 percent from 
last year and the same as indicated in march 
the 1990 tobacco crop is being planted on 725000 acres up 7 
percent from 1990 but down from the 731000 acres indicated by the 
march survey 
all wheat plantings were shown at 773 million acres up 1 
percent from 1989 the march survey showed total wheat at 776 
million acres 
the report did not include 1990 production forecasts new wheat 
figures will be issued by usda on july 12 and estimates for corn 
and other springplanted crops on aug 9 
meanwhile a related report showed the nations corn inventory 
as of june 1 was an estimated 284 billion bushels down 17 percent 
from a year earlier of the total 162 billion bushels were stored 
on farms 
the use of corn in march april and may was estimated at 197 
billion bushels up 11 percent from disappearance in the second 
quarter of 1989 the report said 
stocks of oldcrop wheat on june 1 the beginning of the new 
wheat marketing year were reported at 535 million bushels down 24 
percent from a year ago and the smallest carryover since 1975 even 
so that was much larger than the 452 million bushels estimated 
previously 
the soybean stockpile at 596 million bushels on june 1 was up 28 
percent from a year earlier

trade between the two countries 
ronald j prucha associate administrator of the departments 
food safety and inspection service said thursday the products 
would still be thoroughly inspected at slaughter and processing 
plants in canada under a system that is nearly identical to us 
inspection 
however he said canadian products in the proposed oneyear 
experiment would no longer be randomly sampled at the border a 
reciprocal arrangement would be used for us meat and poultry 
products entering canada 
prucha said the proposal would help implement the united

the country needs to boost the number of drug 
treatment slots but treatment on demand is a bad idea the 
nations drug control policy director says 
taxpayers should not be asked to support a program governed by 
the whim and caprice of people who are on drugs william j 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
said thursday 
many drug abusers start and stop treatment programs repeatedly 
without ever completing one he said at a white house news 
conference 
the goal bennett said is to have sufficient capacity to 
provide treatment for people who will benefit from it and who are 
serious about undergoing the process of treatment 
the bush administration is seeking 15 billion for drug 
treatment next year a 68 percent increase over the budget when 
president bush took office 
if the money is approved and states match the federal effort 
there will be treatment slots for 19 million people by the end of 
fiscal 1991 said dr herbert kleber bennetts deputy director for 
drug demand reduction 
kleber estimated that up to 25 million people need treatment 
the most recent treatment capacity figure is for 1987 he said 
when there were slots available for 800000 people 
the government estimates there are 4 million to 6 million 
addicts nationwide of whom about onequarter can stop using drugs 
on their own and another quarter wont stop using drugs no matter 
what kleber said the rest need formal treatment programs he said 
bennett and kleber spoke at a news conference with louis w 
sullivan secretary of health and human services to announce the 
publication of a report called understanding drug treatment 
bennett conceded the report does not break any new ground but 
instead is a compilation of knowledge on the matter written in 
laymans terms to prompt interest in the subject 
the report notes that some hindrances to increasing the number 
of treatment slots are a lack of trained staff and community 
resistance to locating new treatment programs in neighborhoods 
where they are needed 
bennett dismissed arguments often raised by congressional 
democrats that he cares more about law enforcement than treatment 
and that the drug war budget reflects that bias by devoting 70 
percent to law enforcement efforts 
i have always believed that effective drug treatment must be 
an integral part of any successful national drug control 
strategy bennett said and the more ive seen and learned 
about good drug treatment the more convinced ive become 
sullivan called treatment one of the most important tools we 
have in alleviating the pain and misery that drug addiction has 
wrought upon our nation 
but it isnt easy the report said 
success often comes only after a relapse into drug use and 
further treatment which complicates attempts to measure the 
efficacy of any single treatment program the report says 
drug treatment may be deemed successful when three to five years 
after treatment a former addict is no longer using drugs 
said bennett for some who get into drugs there is no 
salvation we believe very much in treatments possibilities but 
we also know that some stories that begin with drugs do not and 
will not ever have happy endings 
the report noted that people with more resources and more at 
stake do much better than those who have nothing to lose 
bennett has asked congress to require that states develop 
treatment plans and he wants federal funds spent only on programs 
that work he acknowledged that different measures of success would 
be needed based on differing clienteles 
kleber said an index has been developed that accounts for 
differences in patient backgrounds and enables you to start with 
a level playing field in comparing programs 
bennett said accountability is essential and that no one at the 
20 treatment programs he has visited has objected to the idea of 
evaluation 
the people who run good treatment programs want to be 
evaluated because they are proud of what they do he said

a car bomb exploded on a busy street 
outside a police station in the cocaine capital of medellin 
killing 14 people and wounding 30 many of them children police 
said 
no group claimed responsibility for thursdays bombing but 
police blamed drug traffickers who are waging a terror campaign in 
response to a 10monthold government crackdown on the narcotics 
trade 
people screamed hysterically crying and searching for loved 
ones after the blast one man screamed theyve done me in 
theyve done me in they killed my son as he dropped to the 
ground weeping 
a day earlier security forces deactivated a car bomb loaded 
with a half ton of dynamite in a parking lot near a city government 
building in medellin police said 
col jorge ferrero who thursday became police chief in 
colombias secondlargest city said four of those killed and many 
of the wounded were children others slain included a reporter and 
the wife of a senator he said 
the blast occurred minutes after ferrero was sworn in as 
medellins new police chief several miles away 
the explosion destroyed at least 10 cars and left a crater 
fivefeet deep and 12feet wide it also damaged several nearby 
stores 
witnesses told radio networks that minutes before the bomb 
exploded they saw a man running away from a small sedan parked in 
front of the police station 
police said the car which had false license plates was packed 
with 330 pounds of explosives the bomb set fire to several nearby 
cars 
four people were pronounced dead at the scene and the others 
died in hospitals bernardo guerra president of the medellin 
governments emergency committee told rcn 
guerra said 30 people were injured and many of them were in 
critical condition one of those injured was a policeman 
medellin 160 miles northwest of bogota has 3 million 
residents it is home to the cocaine cartel of the same name that 
before the crackdown supplied about 70 percent of the drug sold on 
us streets 
at least 285 people have died in hundreds of bomb attacks in 
colombia over the past 10 months since the cartels began fighting 
the governments efforts to extradite suspected traffickers 
in april the drug cartel announced it would pay 4300 for each 
police officer slain since january 150 policemen have been killed 
in the state of antioquia and all but 17 in the state capital of 
medellin 
colombia has sent 15 drug suspects to the united states since 
last august when president virgilio barco ordered the crackdown in 
retaliation for the slaying by traffickers of a presidential 
candidate 
presidentelect cesar gaviria who takes office aug 7 has said 
he will continue the war on trafficking but has hinted he will not 
make extraditions a major part of that war without more foreign aid 
and preferential trade status

veterans space scientists and those in need 
of housing will gain most from a spending measure passed by the 
house 
the house voted 35548 thursday to spend 836 billion next year 
for the veterans affairs and housing and urban development 
departments the national aeronautics and space administration and 
19 independent agencies and offices 
the bill covers the fiscal year beginning oct 1 spending this 
year is set at 713 billion 
an increase of 15 billion for veterans housing and space and 
science programs is offset by cuts elsewhere 
the senate must come up with a spending plan for the same 
departments and agencies however and no action is expected before 
september 
also the housing component is bound to change since a housing 
bill outlining the kinds of programs that will exist in 1991 still 
must clear both chambers 
the senate version was passed wednesday and the house must 
still vote on its version the house spending plan is calculated 
using current programs 
highlights of the spending bill 
26 billion for hud compared with 15 billion this year the 
1991 bill raises spending for housing assistance to the poor 
elderly and disabled from 78 billion to 116 billion the bill 
also includes 340 million to help the homeless an increase of 56 
million over this year 
313 billion for the va a 16 billion increase over this 
year it includes 157 billion for compensation and pensions 
along with a record 123 billion for medical care the bill also 
includes 572 million for construction including nearly 250 
million for a new veterans hospital in detroit 
143 billion for nasa a 2 billion increase over the current 
year the amount includes 23 billion for the space station the 
amounts however are less than those requested by the bush 
administration which had sought major increases for exploration of 
outer space 
the house also raised spending for the national science 
foundation by more than a quarterbillion dollars close to what 
president bush requested 
the house cut out 6 million requested by the administration to 
search for signs of intelligence in outer space 
16 billion for the environmental protection agencys 
superfund to clean up toxic waste this is 130 million less than 
what the administration had requested but 80 million more than 
this year 
37 million for the consumer product safety commission 1 
million more than sought by the administration 
108 million in new spending for an office of inspector 
general in the resolution trust corp a government agency that is 
managing the savings and loan bailout program

the senate beat back an effort thursday to 
scrap curbs on nine semiautomatic assault weapons and voted for 
tougher penalties for firearms violations 
senators also rejected a move to drop death penalty provisions 
and replace them with mandatory life sentences 
the drug traffickers have not stopped using assault weapons 
theyre not going to stop using assault weapons but at least we can 
stop them from using these assault weapons declared sen dennis 
deconcini dariz 
the senate voted 5048 in favor of keeping the restrictions as 
the members resurrected a broad crime bill 
after that vote it went on to add tougher mandatory sentences 
to the bill by an 8712 vote fortytwo democrats were joined by 
eight republicans in upholding the semiautomatic restrictions 
thirtysix republicans and 12 democrats voted against 
as the senate worked into the night it rejected 7325 a move by 
sen mark hatfield rore to drop the numerous death penalty 
provisions in the bill and replace them with mandatory life 
sentences 
hatfield said the death penalty represented a primal urge for 
revenge sadistic revenge and sen john chafee rri said the 
senate seemed to be on a death penalty rampage today 
the senate also approved an amendment that would allow indian 
reservations to decide for themselves whether to impose the death 
penalty in local murder cases that ordinarily would come under 
federal law 
the measure would not affect provisions of the bill calling for 
the death penalty for presidential assassination treason 
espionage and other crimes 
sen pete v domenici rnm said indian tribes should have 
the same rights as states in deciding whether to impose capital 
punishment for murder 
sen strom thurmond rsc countered that it would have the 
effect of exempting indians who commit heinous vicious murders 
from the federal death penalty simply because their tribes dont 
like it 
the bill appeared dead several weeks ago when the curbs on 
semiautomatic weapons were accepted 
vice president dan quayle was presiding and critics of the 
restrictions had said earlier that if called upon to break a tie he 
would vote for an amendment that would drop the weapons 
restrictions 
sen phil gramm rtexas had urged the senate to drop the 
restrictions in favor of tougher mandatory sentences for 
gunrelated offenses 
those who are going to violate the law and use 
supersophisticated weapons are going to violate gun control 
laws said gramm 
the penalty provision contained in gramms amendment would 
impose a mandatory 10 years in prison to life for federal crimes 
involving firearms and the death penalty for killing anyone with a 
firearm in the most serious federal cases 
we are talking about a choice between gun control on one hand 
and criminal control on the other hand gramm said here we are 
talking about criminal control 
major provisions of the bill call for the death penalty for 30 
federal offenses and would streamline the appeals system with an 
eye to ending delays of a decade or more in carrying out death 
sentences the measure also would make minor changes in the 
moneylaundering laws 
the measure started as part of president bushs anticrime 
package but has largely been rewritten on capitol hill the 
administration is opposed to many of the provisions 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine won approval of 
an agreement under which lawmakers would work on the crime bill 
thursday and again on friday before leaving for their fourth of 
july recess 
the senate would not vote on final passage on the measure 
however until july 12 when the lawmakers will have returned from 
the holidays 
the senate turned to the crime bill after hours of lastminute 
negotiations 
the measure stalled two weeks ago when senate supporters of the 
national rifle association failed to kill restrictions on assault 
weapons and hundreds of amendments flowed into the hopper 
mitchell was unable to break a likely filibuster and halted 
action on the bill while lawmakers sought a deal to pare down the 
number of amendments 
we have done a brutalization job to get it down from 187 to 
nine said sen alan simpson rwyo speaking only of the 
proposed republican changes 
mitchell finally won approval of a complex agreement under which 
lawmakers will be able to offer amendments on topics ranging from 
savings and loan fraud to victims rights and tent prisons 
as debate got under way sen david pryor dark read what he 
said was a letter from a constituent who belongs to the association 
that said the nra has worked itself into a frenzied paranoia 
over the crime bill 
the letter apologized for an nra letter critical of pryor that 
was mailed to gun owners in arkansas 
deconcini praised gramm for moving to stiffen criminal penalties 
but said law enforcement is asking us to help them by resisting 
efforts to drop the assault weapons curbs 
the drug traffickers have not stopped using assault weapons 
theyre not going to stop using assault weapons but at least we can 
stop them from using these assault weapons deconcini said 
under the agreement reached by the senate lawmakers would drop 
provisions of the package that would permit searches with flawed 
warrants and create an elite federal force of drug and organized 
crime prosecutors

ate through an electronic cable on an m1 tank in about a half hour 
the practice of using socalled ds2 prompted congressional 
investigators on thursday to urge defense secretary dick cheney to 
direct the two services to find a safer cheaper alternative 
it also drew the ire of the chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on environment energy and natural 
resources who berated an army brigadier general for his response 
to the investigators findings 
based on the general accounting office report the testimony 
it appears there are equally effective and less hazardous 
alternatives that are already available said rep mike synar 
dokla can i get a commitment from you the army will consider 
alternatives without waiting 10 or 20 years to develop a new 
decontaminant 
brig gen david a nydam commanding general of the us 
chemical research development and engineering center said he 
could not commit the army to such action like that 
we have looked at all the alternatives ds2 continues to be 
the best that there is available nydam said 
synar responded angrily 
if you dont have the serious commitment to change the 
potential environmental health exposure to our fighting men and 
women you need to check your credentials at the door the 
congressman said 
it could be literally another agent orange sitting out 
there he said 
the criticism came as representatives from gao the 
investigative arm of congress detailed serious problems with the 
solution ranging from leaking containers that were improperly 
stored to sales to private individuals who were never informed of 
the hazards 
in defense of their selection army officials said that unlike 
the navy and air force the services forces live in the field and 
must take their equipment with them 
this requires the availability of a decontaminant which can 
effectively be used in an efficient and immediate manner in 
locations where water may be severely limited in availability 
nydam said 
the military services have purchased about 5 million gallons of 
ds2 since the early 1960s with the army requiring the largest 
amount 666000 gallons at a cost of nearly 18 million 
the chemical solution is manufactured by dalden corp of 
roanoke texas and poly research of holtsville ny 
the gao found that ds2 is toxic and highly corrosive and can 
cause severe burns liver damage and reproductive or birth defects 
based on the problems the air force and navy have opted for less 
toxic alternatives 
the army despite its own tests that show bleaches were just as 
effective as ds2 continues to stick with the chemical solution 
in addition the gao found that at five of the us facilities 
the ds2 was improperly stored and in some cases the cans were 
leaking 
at fort sill okla the chemical was stored with supertropical 
bleach a combination that could set off an explosion meanwhile 
at fort lewis wash cans of ds2 were stored in a shed without 
walls exposing the material to the elements 
nydam said the army was aware of the problem and was correcting 
the mistakes at the storage facility 
the gao also found that the army sold cans of the chemical to 
private citizens but failed to provide them with material safety 
data sheets which identify the health and environmental hazards 
associated with ds2

there will be fewer stars in the armed forces 
in the coming years now that defense secretary dick cheney says 
cuts in the military must start at the top 
approving a recommendation made by gen colin powell chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff and the chiefs of the branches of the 
services cheney decided to cut 78 generals and admirals from the 
top levels of the nations military leadership 
the decision would result only in a 7 percent cut in the number 
of men and women who wear the gilded stars and braid of the 
militarys highest ranks 
the reduction is a far cry from the much larger cuts in store 
for most of the services army officials have predicted that they 
may be cutting one soldier in four from the ranks over the next 
five years 
currently there are 1073 toplevel positions in the military 
407 generals in the army 338 in the air force 70 in the marine 
corps and 258 flag officers in the navy 
the cut will bring the new level to 995 such slots by 1995 
according to pentagon spokesman pete williams 
at the end of april there were 2 million men and women on 
active duty in the nations armed forces 
williams said the move is part of the pentagons effort to cut 
back its forces amid the drive to save money and adjust to lessened 
eastwest tensions 
he said it was only the first of the cuts that can be expected 
in the pentagon rolls including slots in the departments top 
civilian leadership 
powell in a statement released at the pentagon said his 
proposal reflects the need for economies in the current 
budgetcutting climate 
the joint chiefs and i believe this plan reflects an 
appropriate balance between continuing requirements and changing 
force structure powell said in light of anticipated force 
structure changes we recognize the necessity for general and flag 
officer requirements and inventory to drop below current levels 
williams said cheney and powell wanted to emphasize that it was 
appropriate to begin force level reductions at the top and 
among all the services 
the cut means the elimination of 33 generals from the army 27 
from the air force three from the marine corps and 15 flag 
officers from the navy 
a total of 20 positions will be eliminated before the end of 
1991 an additional 20 in each of the next two years and 18 in 
1994 williams said 
the spokesman said that an attempt would be made to reduce the 
numbers through retirement and attrition but that additional steps 
may have to be taken to make the cuts 
i dont think retirement and attrition are going to do it 
he said 
williams said the exact job positions have not yet been 
designated for elimination and that such decisions will be left to 
the various services 
in a related development the army announced that it has 
proposed cutting about 7000 civilian jobs the decision primarily 
affects jobs at army materiel command which is the armys largest 
civilian employer 
many such announcements affecting the pentagons 11 
millionstrong civilian work force are expected in the coming 
months and years given the pentagons current budget cutting drive 
the personnel announcements came as new chiefs prepared to take 
over the top leadership positions with the navy and air force this 
weekend 
adm frank kelso was being elevated to chief of naval operations 
today at a ceremony at the naval academy taking over from another 
submariner adm carlisle trost 
kelso born in fayetteville tenn most recently served as the 
head of the navys atlantic command 
gen michael dugan most recently the commander in charge of the 
us air forces in europe and the allied air forces in central 
europe assumes the command held by gen larry welch 
dugan of albany ny is a former combat pilot during the 
vietnam war who flew more than 300 missions

the crippled hubble space telescopes main 
camera still may be able to search for other solar systems a step 
toward determining if life exists elsewhere in the universe a 
scientist with the project said 
to conduct the search hubble was designed to watch six to eight 
stars for several years to see if they slowly wobble a sign that 
the stars are being tugged by gravity from orbiting planets said 
jim westphal principal scientist for the hubbles widefield and 
planetary camera 
despite a flaw that prevents proper focusing of the 
observatorys mirrors its entirely possible we can still do 
that said westphal a professor of planetary sciences at the 
california institute of technology in pasadena we should know a 
week from now after computerized tests are completed 
to learn if a star wobbles the telescope simply must accurately 
determine the stars position relative to stars around it 
we dont really care how sharp the image is westphal said 
thursday by phone from maryland where he was helping nasa 
officials deal with the hubbles troubles 
the national aeronautics and space administration announced 
wednesday that an apparent flaw in manufacturing one of the 15 
billion telescopes mirrors left the widefield camera virtually 
useless while its faintobject camera would perform no better than 
a telescope on earth the performance of two of three other 
instruments also will be impaired nasa said 
the widefield camera built by nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory already was scheduled to be replaced in june 1993 by 
space shuttle astronauts who were to install a more advanced camera 
now under construction at jpl the agency now expects to change the 
optics in the new camera to compensate for fuzzy focus caused by 
the mirror defect 
until then the telescope will be unable to study the age of the 
universe distinguish individual stars in distant galaxies or learn 
more about incredibly bright light sources called quasars westphal 
said 
scientists felt pretty gloomy westphal said but still 
optimistic the search for other solar systems can proceed 
the search is important because if lots of stars have planets 
then the chances that some of those planets might have life on them 
is better and ultimately the chance there might be intelligent 
life somewhere is greater he said 
even if it worked perfectly the hubble couldnt detect life on 
other planets but westphal said it could bring scientists one step 
closer to the answer to one of the most interesting of all 
questions is there anybody else out there 
despite the focusing problem the main camera still should be 
able to search for planets outside our solar system five times more 
effectively than any telescope on earth westphal said 
test photographs show that about 85 percent of the light that 
enters the camera is not properly focused but about 15 percent 
is where it belongs and makes a nice little sharp image he 
explained so we anticipate that we can probably use that little 
sharp core to watch for stars to wobble 
trying to see a jupitersized planet orbiting a nearby star 
often has been compared to a person trying to see a speck of dust 
miles away when that speck is sitting next to a 1000watt light 
bulb 
during the past decade astronomers found indirect evidence that 
more than three dozen stars seem to be surrounded either by 
flattened disks of dust possibly young solar systems in the 
process or forming planets or by planetlike objects known as 
brown dwarfs 
westphal said plans call for hubble to observe only one of 
those barnards star which has a tantalizing wobble to it 
the others are too far for hubble to observe 
the stars westphal hopes the telescope can observe are all 
considered nearby or within 10 light years of earth thats 
almost 60 trillion miles

a house committee chairman wants the energy 
department to reconsider the security clearance of victor stello 
jr the administrations failed nominee to head nuclear weapons 
production 
but a spokesman says the department has no such plans 
stello allegedly told congress contradictory statements and 
therefore may not qualify for a highlevel job rep john dingell 
dmich wrote energy secretary james d watkins 
dingells letter released thursday noted that the energy 
departments requirement for highsecurity jobs bans an individual 
who is not honest reliable or trustworthy and there is no 
adequate evidence of rehabilitation or reform 
amid controversy in april stello withdrew his name for 
consideration to become assistant secretary of energy for defense 
programs 
we do not question mr stellos loyalty to this country 
nevertheless in view of the derogatory information now in the 
possession of the department mr stello may not be qualified 
to hold a high security job wrote dingell chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee 
dingell said his panels oversight and investigations 
subcommittee which he also chairs had learned that the nuclear 
regulatory commissions inspector general found that stello made 
contradictory statements to congress and to nrc investigators 
the letter did not elaborate on what the statements involved 
energy department spokesman tom olson said the agency had no 
plans to withdraw stellos security clearance and that it disagreed 
with dingells reading of the inspector generals report 
were very familiar with the facts of the case the facts have 
been aired a number of times theres nothing in the report that 
shows that there is any reason to believe that hes been 
dishonest olson said 
stello has just under gone several security checks and 
investigations olson said 
during the administrations 10month fight to win senate 
confirmation of stello the nominee was accused of improprieties in 
his 24 years with the nuclear regulatory commission which has 
jurisdiction over civilian nuclear reactors 
among the accusations was that stello altered agency rules at 
the request of nuclear utilities to the detriment of safety and 
that he authorized cash payments to an informer as part of a 
personal vendetta within the nrc as its chief staff official 
stello went to the energy department on temporary assignment 
last july after bush nominated him for the weapons chiefs job 
when he withdrew his nomination the energy department said 
stello would stay on in a civil service job whose duties include 
overseeing efforts to restart idled reactors at the savannah river 
nuclear weapons plant in south carolina the job does not require 
senate confirmation 
dingell called the nrc inspector generals report 
disturbing especially coupled with earlier complaints that 
stellos allegedly supported a plan to allow major security 
problems to go uncorrected at the rocky flats facility in colorado 
which makes triggers for nuclear weapons 
the chairman asked watson to advise the committee by july 13 on 
whether stello would maintain access to classified information

congressional conferees are refusing to 
approve trial us participation in international oil spill 
accords thereby clearing a major hurdle in legislation to 
compensate victims of accidents 
the conferees set to meet again july 12 now can turn to the 
two remaining issues in the bill amounts of penalties to be 
assessed against those responsible for spills and whether to 
require doublehulled vessels 
the conference by voice vote on thursday did approve 
nonbinding language stating its in the best interests of the 
united states to participate in two international compensation 
agreements 
but senate conferees refused to approve actual membership 
partly because the chamber has been unable to exercise its right to 
approve international treaties 
the senators led by majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
also wanted to preserve rights of states to impose their own 
liability rules for spills in their waters 
two international agreements called protocols were negotiated 
in 1984 and 41 countries have ratified them but they wont become 
operational unless the united states approves its participation 
rep gerry e studds dmass proposed that the united states 
join the international agreements on a trial basis for five years 
if they were modified to comply with federal and state liability 
laws 
if the modifications were not made at the end of five years the 
nation would have withdrawn from the agreements 
the house conferees unanimously approved the proposal but the 
senate members voted unanimously for rejection 
the house side then came back with the sense of congress 
advisory provisions that won acceptance 
with no international agreements alaska for example was able 
to impose unlimited liability on the operators of the 
usregistered exxon valdez the tanker that spilled 11 million 
gallons of crude oil in prince william sound last year 
alaska could have held the operators of a foreignflag vessel to 
the same standard but would not be able to if the international 
limits were in force 
under the international accords those hurt by an oil spill 
could first seek compensation from insurers for the responsible 
party with a ceiling of 75 million 
the applicant then could seek up to 260 million from an 
international fund that already has been established without us 
participation 
as a third step those affected could try to tap a us domestic 
fund that would allow collections of up to 1 billion per spill 
the domestic fund already has been established from a 
nickelabarrel fee on oil transporters although no money has been 
spent it would become operational under the new legislation

after thousands of volunteers sneezed sniffled 
and coughed their way through years of tests researchers are 
conceding what conventional wisdom said all along theres no cure 
for the common cold 
after 44 years the common cold research center is closing 
saturday conceding defeat in the cold war 
but the centers administrator arthur amos insists that the 
18000 volunteers who passed through the hospital near salisbury 
80 miles west of london did not suffer in vain 
going back in time we used to think there was only one cold 
virus now we know there are nearly 200 so there is no chance of 
finding a vaccine amos said weve been trying to find a 
compound that acts on a family of viruses but weve had no luck 
some of the centers discoveries cannot be explained amos said 
why for example did onethird of volunteers never show any signs 
of a cold while the others exposed to the same virus coughed 
sneezed and felt miserable 
blood tests at the beginning of the trial and at the end often 
show changes in antibody levels which means even if it didnt seem 
like they have a cold they have a subclinical cold amos said 
the volunteers received no medication amos said unless they 
were in extreme discomfort in which case they got aspirin 
the research center was housed in the harvard hospital so named 
because it was sent to britain by the harvard medical school in 
1940 
during world war ii it was an american military field hospital 
and in 1946 it was turned over to the common cold project 
the volunteers who learned of the project through newspaper 
advertisements and wordofmouth ranged in age from 18 to 50 and 
some were repeat participants one couple met there and returned 
the following year for their honeymoon one man went through the 
10day quarantined program 26 times but amos said he was a 
rather odd sort of person 
many participants came to vacation at the center nestled in 
rolling countryside in the shadow of the 404foot spire atop 
salisbury cathedral englands highest spire 
two or three volunteers shared each of the centers 12 
apartments 
we usually have a flat empty in reserve in case theyre 
imcompatible but in the main they usually get along amos said 
the volunteers were barred from salisbury and neighboring 
villages and had to keep at least 30 feet away from anyone but 
their roommates or the gowned masked medical staff 
if they were on a walk and couldnt avoid meeting someone 
they were told to put a paper tissue over their nose and walk by 
quick said amos 
most volunteers came out of curiosity amos said not for the 
money a paltry daily sum of pocket money now set at 3 
amos who has had only one cold in his six years at the center 
will work for three more months overseeing its closure 
the medical research council which had provided the centers 1 
million in annual funding decided the unit would close after 
director david tyrell retired 
it was so much his work that it was not really viable without 
him a council spokeswoman said

president rodrigo borja is predicting that 
communist guerrillas will soon release an american gold miner they 
kidnapped more than two months ago 
borja said thursday he had been receiving reports on the 
progress of talks to free scott heimdal who reportedly is being 
held in a rebel camp across the colombian border 
heimdal 27 of peoria ill was kidnapped april 28 while 
riding in a dugout canoe near the small mining camp where he worked 
in the jungle 100 miles northeast of quito 
heimdals parents roy and marge arrived in quito on june 18 to 
take charge of negotiations to free their son 
i think the negotiations are going well borja said in an 
interview im confident that he will be returned safe and 
sound 
borjas remarks were the first hes made to the foreign press 
concerning the kidnapping he did not say to what extent ecuadoran 
authorities were involved in efforts to release heimdal and has 
not met with heimdals parents the kidnappers who have identified 
themselves as members of the peoples liberation army asked the 
equivalent of 612000 for heimdals release according to his 
employer the iminco mining company 
heimdals parents raised about 60000 mostly in community 
donations and that money has reportedly been turned over to the 
kidnappers 
heimdal was in charge of starting up dredging operations for 
iminco and was leaving the companys camp to return to quito when 
he was abducted 
on another matter borja said he has asked the united states to 
help build a jungle radar system to monitor drugsmuggling planes 
in his countrys airspace but has gotten no response 
president bush has proposed spending 22 billion over the next 
five years in military police and economic aid to fight narcotics 
trafficking in bolivia peru and colombia 
borja said ecuadors drugtrafficking problem is far less 
serious than that of its neighbors but added this is the moment 
in which our country has to begin battling this plague later will 
be too late

the two major political parties and 
congressional candidates accepted nearly 12 million in 
contributions this decade from fundraising groups and individuals 
connected to the savings and loan industry according to a new 
statistical analysis 
common cause which compiled the figures from public records 
said the contributions helped influence legislation and other 
actions that loosened regulation of the sampl industry the industry 
now is subject to a government bailout estimated to cost 300 
billion or more 
using federal election commission data common cause said it 
identified 157 political action committees and 1074 individuals 
associated with savings and loans 
the pacs contributed 62 million to congressional campaigns and 
party organizations in the 1980s and the individuals provided 54 
million it said current members of congress received 67 
million of which 38 million went to democratic incumbents and 
29 million to republicans 
political parties received 2 million from sampl interests in the 
1980s common cause said including 11 million that went to 
republican committees and 891000 to democratic coffers 
five senators are under ethics committee investigation for 
intervening on behalf of charles h keating jr the owner of a 
failed california sampl whose rescue is expected to cost the 
government more than 2 billion 
keating and his wife donated 97950 in their names to 
candidates and political party committees during the 1980s common 
cause said keating also helped raised hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for a handful of candidates 
four of the socalled keating five were among the top 10 
senators in receiving samplrelated donations in the 1980s according 
to the common cause analysis 
according to common cause 
sen donald riegle dmich now chairman of the banking 
committee received 200900 from sampl interests in the 1980s the 
secondhighest total among senators 
sen alan cranston dcalif 143700 fourth 
sen dennis deconcini dariz 84200 seventh 
sen john mccain rariz 80393 eighth 
the fifth member of the group ohio democratic sen john glenn 
ranked 30th among senators receiving 32600 from pacs and 
individuals associated with sampls in the decade common cause said 
the overall senate leader in such receipts was republican sen 
pete wilson now californias gop gubernatorial nominee common 
cause said samplrelated contributions to wilson in the 1980s totaled 
243000 
on the house side the top six incumbents in terms of

some species of dolphins are being slaughtered to 
nearextinction by the international fishing industry according to 
a report published today by a conservationist group 
the environmental investigation agency said at least 500000 
dolphins porpoises and small whales are killed around the world 
each year but that this figure could be three or four times higher 
if undocumented kills are included 
the londonbased agency called for the international whaling 
commission to impose immediate worldwide controls on the killing of 
small cetaceans as the animals are collectively known 
the international whaling commission is scheduled to meet in the 
netherlands next week 
unless international action is taken immediately to roll back 
the intense pressures threatening the survival of earths most 
delightful species the report said many populations of 
cetaceans are likely to disappear or become extinct before this 
century is finished 
the study called japan the worlds biggest killer of small 
cetaceans slaughtering at least 100000 a year and thereby 
threatening the survival of three types of small cetaceans in the 
region 
it said peru kills 50000 a year by hunting 
in british waters all small cetaceans are protected by law and 
that there is believed to be no intentional killing the report 
said but it said that in ireland about 1000 porpoises a year are 
killed in nets 
the report said small cetaceans are slaughtered for human 
consumption and for pet food it said others are used as bait or 
are caught accidentally in nets intended to trap other creatures 
it said small cetaceans are also hunted because fishermen see 
them as fisheating rivals 
the study said many die from modern fishing methods becoming 
entangled in tuna nets or in drift nets up to 40 feet wide that 
allow no means of escape

prosecutors were disappointed that the us 
supreme court permanently blocked the execution of convicted killer 
john harvey adamson a day after upholding the law under which he 
was sentenced to die in the gas chamber 
id just liked to have gassed him attorney general bob 
corbin said 
the supreme court upheld the death penalty statute in arizona 
on wednesday so we figured that since adamson is coming up on the 
same issues theyd do the same thing corbin said after the 
ruling was released thursday 
two of the justices who voted with the majority in the 54 
decision upholding the state law did not take part in thursdays 
action turning wednesdays dissenters into a 43 majority that 
spared adamsons life 
adamson was convicted in the 1976 carbomb death of newspaper 
reporter don bolles who had investigated organized crime for the 
arizona republic prosecutors said adamson was paid 100000 to 
attach a bomb to bolles car 
adamson said he was pleased by thursdays ruling but declined to 
comment further department of corrections spokesman michael arra 
corbin said adamson will be removed from death row but still 
faces about 10 years in prison adamson began serving his sentence 
in december 1978 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals threw out adamsons death 
sentence in 1988 striking down a provision in arizona law that 
lets judges instead of juries choose between life and death for 
convicted murderers 
the appeals courts ruling questioned the validity of death 
penalty laws in idaho and montana which also allow for sentencing 
by judges the supreme court in another case wednesday declared the 
arizona provision constitutional 
but in a brief order thursday the justices ruled 43 against 
reinstating adamsons death sentence 
two justices who had voted to uphold arizonas death penalty 
law sandra day oconnor a former state judge in arizona and 
anthony m kennedy a former 9th circuit court judge did not 
participate in adamsons case 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens who voted a day earlier to strike 
down the law also voted to void adamsons death penalty 
idahos attorney general jim jones called the sequence of 
events ridiculous but predicted the decision would affect no other 
death row inmate 
it really means not too much more than adamson is going to get 
off because of a complete fluke and the work of the judges of the 
9th circuit court jones said

changes in tampons have led to a 93 percent drop 
in toxic shock syndrome since 1980 when the disease was linked to 
tampon use federal officials say 
just 61 cases of toxic shock syndrome were reported last year 
compared with 890 cases in 1980 the centers for disease control 
said thursday 
toxic shock a bacterial infection found most often in 
menstruationage women was linked especially to the most absorbent 
brands of tampons 
cdc researchers are convinced that the decrease is real and 
that tampon characteristics had been much of the problem said dr 
anne schuchat a cdc infectious disease specialist 
our initial concern was that after the public attention and 
the media attention went away people were not bothering to 
report cases she said 
but a 198687 study which actively sought to locate cases 
across several states found one case per 100000 women between the 
ages of 14 and 44 a tenfold drop from the 1980 rate schuchat 
said 
the united states recorded 45 cases of toxic shock in 
menstruationage women last year and 16 nonmenstruation cases a 
decade ago 812 of the 890 cases were associated with menstruation 
three important developments occurred in tampons in the 1980s 
the cdc said 
the brand implicated in many early cases rely was taken off 
the market 
tampons became less absorbent in 1980 42 percent of tampon 
users used very high absorbency products the type considered most 
risky for toxic shock by 1986 it was 1 percent 
the material makeup of tampons changed rely consisted of 
polyester foam and carboxymethylcellulose tampons containing 
polyacrylate were withdrawn in 1985 and current tampons are made 
with cotton or rayon 
the withdrawal of rely and the drop in use of highabsorbency 
tampons correlate with a marked decrease in incidence of 
menstrual toxic shock syndrome though its still unclear why 
those types of tampons increased the risk the report said 
the food and drug administration declared last year that tampon 
makers must use uniform labeling terms for absorbency ranges 
allowing women to compare brands federal health officials 
recommend that women who use tampons rather than sanitary napkins 
which have no known risk of toxic shock should use the lowest 
absorbency product effective for them 
in its report the cdc said other factors may have contributed 
to the drop in toxic shock after the highly publicized concerns 
over the disease tampon use may have decreased and milder cases 
may not be reported as often

police groups who have campaigned against 
semiautomatic assault rifles are getting the credit following a 
narrow vote by the senate to maintain curbs on nine such weapons in 
an omnibus anticrime bill 
why we won is that law enforcement did a better lobbying job 
than the national rifle association sen dennis deconcini 
dariz said thursday after the senate voted 5048 to maintain the 
curbs 
tougher penalties for federal firearms violations sexual abuse 
of children and selling the new narcotic drug ice also went 
into the bill as senators worked past midnight this morning 
the senate also rejected efforts to drop numerous death penalty 
provisions in the anticrime bill it did vote to let indians decide 
for themselves whether to impose capital punishment for murders 
committed on reservations 
central provisions of the bill call for capital punishment for 
30 federal crimes and streamline the appeals process with an eye to 
ending delays of up to a decade in carrying out executions 
the senate adjourned until after the fourth of july recess 
plans to vote on passage of the overall anticrime package when it 
returns 
fortytwo democrats and eight republicans voted to uphold the 
ban on import or manufacture in this country of the nine 
semiautomatic assault weapons while 36 republicans and 12 democrats 
voted against 
the result was a further blow to the national rifle association 
which has been fighting the restrictions 
the fraternal order of police the international association of 
chiefs of police and an array of other law enforcement groups have 
been campaigning against assault weapons they say the 
militarystyle rifles and semiautomatic pistols are too dangerous 
to be on the streets 
the anticrime bill had appeared dead when the gun provisions 
survived previous moves to scrap them and the threat of an 
unbreakable filibuster materialized two weeks of bargaining 
however produced agreement to resurrect the bill once part of 
president bushs anticrime package but now largely rewritten 
sen phil gramm rtexas led off thursdays debate with a plan 
to scrap the assault weapons provisions in favor of mandatory 
sentences ranging from 10 years to life for firearmsrelated 
federal crimes and the death penalty in some gun killing cases 
the sad cold reality is that drug felons that are smuggling 
tons of illegal drugs into the country will smuggle firearms 
said gramm they are going to have guns the question is 
are we going to have the stiff mandatory sentences for those who 
violate the law 
we are talking about crime control on one hand and criminal 
control on the other hand gramm said 
the senates 5048 vote to uphold the gun curbs came on a 
deconcini move to combine both the restrictions and gramms tougher 
penalties 
the success of that effort frustrated the move to delete the 
restrictions and the senate then quickly adopted both the 
restrictions and the tougher penalties 
the drug traffickers have not stopped using assault weapons 
theyre not going to stop using assault weapons but at least we can 
stop them from using these assault weapons deconcini said 
vice president dan quayle was presiding over the senate when the 
vote came and was in position to cast the deciding vote if there 
had been a tie 
the senate later rejected 7325 a move by sen mark hatfield 
rore to drop its death penalty provisions and substitute instead 
mandatory life sentences 
hatfield said the death penalty provisions represented a 
primal urge for revenge sadistic revenge and added that it 
placed the united states at odds with western european nations and 
in a category with syria south africa and north korea among other 
countries 
we seem to be on a death penalty rampage today sen john 
chafee rri declared we seem to have applied the death 
penalty to everything except school truancy

about 660000 union members in this 
country of 48 million people are threatening to launch a crippling 
sympathy walkout if the us banana giant chiquita does not raise 
wages for its striking workers 
the chiquita strike that began thursday is the latest and 
potentially most serious labor unrest to hit the 5monthold 
administration of president rafael leonardo callejas 
chiquitas 10000 union members including banana cutters 
railway workers and administrative personnel averaging about 15 a 
day struck for a 60 percent salary increase paralyzing operations 
the 70000strong national federation of workers unions which 
includes the chiquita workers said members of other unions would 
begin walking off their job today beginning with 2000 texaco 
refinery workers the refinery supplies the entire nation 
other labor groups including the 600000member workers 
confederation have said they will strike if chiquita refuses to 
negotiate 
the president of the national legislature rodolfo irias navas 
said the labor unrest could destabilize honduras the poorest 
nation in the hemisphere after haiti with an annual per capita 
income of only 740 
the crisis created by unionism is putting the stability of the 
government in danger he said in a telephone interview 
workers at chiquita brands international inc make an average 
1532 a day and have not had a raise for six years while 
inflation has climbed 50 percent annually their union asked the 
company for a higher pay in october 
company officials calculated the raise would cost 46 million a 
year and had not made a counterproposal thursday after four days of 
negotiating 
the strike is illegal it doesnt make sense we arent going 
to pay higher salaries to our workers chiquita vice president 
eduardo aragon said in a telephone interview 
company officials refused to comment further on the strike 
bananas are honduras leading export and the cincinnatibased 
chiquita formerly united brands is one of the most powerful 
institutions in honduras 
president callejas was trying thursday to stop the strike from 
spreading 
he sent a highlevel delegation to the northern coastal town of 
la lima headquarters of chiquita to mediate talks between union 
and company officials he also kept in close telephone contact with 
union leaders military officials and key advisers 
callejas said he was sympathetic to the strikers calling their 
demands for higher pay just but he said there was no need for a 
strike 
the unions are a fundamental piece of our democratic 
process he told said in a phone interview but with me there 
is no need to strike because the unions can achieve their goals 
through dialogue without resorting to force 
about 4000 health care workers have been on strike since june 
11 to protest the privatization of support services in six of the 
nations 19 public hospitals army troops are occupying the main 
hospital in san pedro sula the nations secondlargest city and 
army medics are providing emergency care 
chiquita which owns the countrys only railroad has enjoyed a 
near monopoly on the banana business in honduras since 1912 it 
currently controls 60 percent of the bananas exported from 
honduras usbased castle and cook controls the other 40 percent

american peace corps volunteers began 
leaving the country today a day after soldiers wearing masks and 
civilian clothes fired on mourners carrying the coffin of a slain 
communist rebel

two people were killed when officials say rebel suspects resisted 
arrest

unheeded said a statement today from the manila branch of the 
rebel new peoples army 
us officials said the first of the peace corps volunteers left 
the philippines for honolulu today and the rest were departing on

return volunteers as soon as possible to continue their efforts 
in development in education programs sidebyside with their 
filipino colleagues and friends

the children of actress jane 
fondas camp for the arts hugged cried and vowed to come back 
someday as their idyllic summer escape to the mountains of santa 
barbara went up in smoke 
the 48 boys and girls at laurel springs camp were only four days 
into their twoweek stay when ferocious brush fires sweeping 
through the mountains of santa barbara forced their evacuation 
the fire that has destroyed 567 homes and businesses and caused 
hundreds of millions of dollars of damage also signaled the end of 
a dream for the youngsters including a group of underprivileged 
kids who had come to the camp on scholarships 
im really bummed out about this fire said 11yearold maya 
hawkins who burst into tears as the children sat in a circle at 
their evacuation center sharing their feelings about the disaster 
laurel springs owned by miss fonda seeks to bring children of 
varying backgrounds together in a program focusing on self esteem 
and the arts the campers ages 9 to 11 come from all parts of 
california 
this camp is her secret said camp director david hodges he 
said miss fonda was told about the fire and expressed concern 
hodges said he reluctantly called parents on thursday and asked 
them to pick up their children although he hoped to reconvene the 
group later smoke and flames made an immediate return to the camp 
impossible 
authorities also were unable to get to area to determine if the 
camp was damaged though they didnt believe it was 
the 4000acre arson fire that broke out late wednesday in a 
valley between santa barbara and the nearby town of goleta was 
still burning today 
the childrens drama began wednesday at dinner time 
we saw this large billowing cloud of smoke in the distance but 
we thought it was far away hodges said we went in to dinner 
but in the middle of dinner the fire department notified us we had 
to evacuate 
driving down the darkened hillsides they saw flames shooting 
skyward and smoke was everywhere 
when i see things like fires on the news i never think it 
will happen to me said one girl and now it was happening to 
me and i was real scared 
for hodges the question was what to do with 48 kids in the 
middle of the night a teacher at nearby santa ynez high school he 
decided to take them there 
we brought some food with us and picked up some more from the 
supermarket he said then the community pitched in a 
restaurant sent enough pizza for all the children and the elks 
club sponsored a dinner thursday 
the youngsters unrolled their sleeping bags and slept in the 
gym by morning they were organizing into groups to swim and play 
games 
all of the children said they wanted to finish out their 
twoweek stay and were sad to go 
i think this is the weirdest week ive ever had one girl 
declared 
counselor colleen shelley addressed the children with tears in 
her eyes 
we have handled this disaster like pros she said this is 
a memory that well all share forever years from now when people 
talk about the great santa barbara fire we will say we were there 
and we survived it

an officer charged with taking 
part in a coverup in the slayings of six jesuit priests says he is 
awaiting orders from superiors before turning himself in to 
authorities 
authorities say a military death squad went to the jesuitrun 
central american university before dawn and shot the priests their 
housekeeper and her teenage daughter 
lt col camilo hernandez who allegedly ordered the burning of 
military log books that traced troop movements on the night of the 
massacre said thursday he is waiting for a goahead from the 
defense minister or head of the joing chiefs of staff to submit to 
arrest 
defense minister gen humberto larios has repeatedly pledged 
full military cooperation with the investigation 
judge ricardo zamora who is in charge of the investigation into 
the nov 16 murders issued a warrant for hernandezs arrest on 
wednesday 
the slow pace of the investigation along with the disappearance 
of evidence and witnesses has been criticized by a us 
congressional committee and officials of the roman catholic church 
the rightwing government of president alfredo cristiani is the 
largest recipient of us aid in the western hemisphere 
rightists considered the leftleaning priests subversive 
because the clerics had said el salvadors decadelong insurgency 
was a war on social and economic injustice rather than a reflection 
of international communist expansion 
meanwhile a colonel has denied having any information that a 
colleague was involved in the massacre judiciary officials say 
army col carlos aviles had been considered a crucial witness 
against col guillermo benavides a colleague who along with three 
lieutenants and five soldiers has been charged with the nov 16 
murders 
sources close to the case described aviles denial made in 
sworn testimony wednesday as a blow to successful prosecution of 
the case 
with the colonels testimony the case becomes even more 
difficult based on the evidence we have now id say there is 
about a 10 percent chance of taking the case to trial one 
prosecutor said 
the military at first denied any connection to the killings 
which took place amid an offensive by leftist rebels in the 
capital the military had said the priests were rebel sympathizers 
the case broke after a us military advisor said aviles told 
him on dec 20 that benavides was involved us army maj eric 
buckland in sworn testimony said benavides confessed his role to 
an officer who then told aviles 
no salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human 
rights crime despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at 
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forces and to 
president cristianis arena partyd during the decadelong civil war

president alan garcia says a us plan to 
forgive much of latin americas foreign debt will help with the war 
on drugs 
president bush said this week the us government would forgive 
or reschedule most of the 12 billion it is owed by latin american 
nations and also called for creation of a hemispherewide free 
market 
the region owes a total of about 300 billion to foreign lenders 
with the debt forgivenesss plan latin american countries will 
have less need to produce dollars through the perverse manner of 
growing coca garcia told reporters thursday coca leaf is the 
raw material of cocaine 
as far as drugs are concerned weve finally made the american 
government understand that this is an economic as well as military 
problem garcia said 
garcia who in 1985 stopped perus payments on its 22 billion 
foreign debt strongly praised most elements of the bush plan 
unveiled wednesday 
for my government which for five years has said the foreign 
debt is unpayable and must be substantially reduced this is a 
transcendental act said garcia who on july 28 will turn over 
the presidency to alberto fujimori 
the presidentelect is now on the first leg of a trip to new 
york and tokyo seeking economic aid 
when garcia came to power five years ago he said he would limit 
debt payments to 10 percent of the countrys export earnings he 
called on other latin american nations to follow his lead 
the move was strongly condemned by lenders and in 1986 the 
international monetary fund suspended relations with peru 
savings that resulted from the cut in debt payments led peru 
into a twoyear economic boom but the economy turned bad in 1987 
when no new loans were forthcoming 
the country has now fallen into its worst economic crisis in 
history four of five people lack steady work inflation is 2000 
percent annually and the government is bankrupt and selling gold 
bars to import food

after the mining industry the country takes in an estimated 1 
billion annually from sales of coca the main ingredient in cocaine 
fujimori has indicated he will sign a 35 million military 
agreement with the united states calling for us army instructors 
to train peruvian soldiers in antidrug and antirebel warfare

a japanese auto parts manufacturer has angrily 
accused its largest stockholder texas oilman t boone pickens of 
slanderous and false charges that deeply offended company 
officials 
the koito manufacturing co withdrew an invitation to pickens to 
visit a company plant today a day after a messy confrontation with 
pickens over his efforts to win seats on the companys board of 
directors 
the debate between pickens and koito has come to symbolize for 
many americans the difficulties faced by us investors in japan at 
a time when many japanese companies are buying up american 
companies and real estate 
the debate points up the fundamental differences between the way 
japanese and us businessmen operate and how they accumulate 
wealth 
pickens accompanied by 32 other american investors had come to 
japan for the japanese auto parts companys annual stockholders 
meeting 
he again raised his demand for four seats on the 20member board 
of directors and presented proposals for changes in company policy 
pickens and the other americans stormed out before voting on his 
proposals was finished claiming that koito was taking his 
suggestions lightly and discriminating against foreigners 
it was a sham an absolute farce he told reporters here 
today koito completely showed the world what its all about in 
corporate japan 
koito president takao matsuura in a statement sent thursday 
night to pickens hotel said the charges were completely 
baseless and untrue adding koito is deeply offended by your 
public remarks 
pickens declared that he would take his case against corporate 
japans closed system to washington and to the upcoming houston 
summit of advanced industrial democracies 
were going to tell it just like it is he said 
pickens who now owns 26 percent of koitos shares has insisted 
that as its largest stockholder he has a right to influence its 
policy 
koito officials say they doubt pickens is a longterm investor 
with a genuine interest in helping manage the company 
in the weeks before the shareholders meeting pickens had 
undertaken a publicity campaign to convince individual japanese 
shareholders of his sincerity in advocating shareholders rights 
matsuura said after the meeting that koito had taken pains to 
answer pickens questions and had carried out procedures agreed to 
during meetings with a courtappointed inspector 
while we were prepared to extend you every courtesy we will 
not allow koito employees shareholders and management to be 
crudely insulted as part of your continual harassment of the 
company he wrote

scholars of the cold war say new insight about the 
era could be gained as soviet authorities move to declassify 
stalinistera documents 
but documents wont tell the whole story they said 
us historians including arthur schlesinger jr a former white 
house adviser to president kennedy took part in a threeday 
seminar with their soviet counterparts to examine the origins of 
the cold war 45 years ago 
the us historians said at a press briefing that participants 
discussed whether the cold war could have been avoided and what 
role national leaders including president truman and soviet 
dictator josef stalin played in creating superpower hostility 
a followup seminar will be held in washington at the end of 
july 
soviet foreign minster eduard a shevardnadze told the visiting 
americans at a meeting thursday morning that the supreme soviet 
legislature would consider measures to declassify postwar 
documents schlesinger said 
we were assured that the law will go through schlesinger 
said we were told they will be declassified in the 
nottoodistant future 
alexander chubaryan a member of the soviet institute of world 
history said the soviets have been slow in making original 
documents available to historians 
the soviet side is lagging behind in the sense of using 
archival documents he said but the seminar has shown that we 
have made progress and we were able to introduce several new 
documents for discussion 
several of the american participants though said that getting 
access to soviet documents was not going to answer all questions 
about the causes of the cold war 
dont kid yourself that all history is in documents said 
walt rostow and economist and former adviser to president johnson 
we are not naive enough to believe that if you collect enough 
documents you will know ever everything 
even so the seminars symbolize the movement from confrontation 
to cooperation between the two superpowers said allen weinstein a 
member of the us institute of peace which is cosponsoring the 
meetings along with the soviet research coordination center 
the cold war the two sides agreed is basically over but 
schlesinger said there were still some residual effects 
some wheels are still spinning he said without elaborating 
harvard historian richard pipes an east european specialist who 
served as an adviser to president reagans national security 
council said one of the causes of the cold war was the 
demonization of the two countries 
they thought capitalism was a demon we thought communism was 
a demon we demonized each other pipes said

despite angry protests from 
environmentalists the government said today it will go ahead with 
plans to kill 30000 baby and adult seals next month 
government officials say the seal population of 12 million on 
the cosat must be reduced because the animals were depleting fish 
stocks 
some 25000 baby seals and 5000 adult male seals are to be 
slaughtered for leather and chicken feed at port nolloth on the 
west coast 
the government seems to be totally insensitive to 
conservation this deal has to be very lucrative if they simply 
ignore local and international opinion on this barbarity said 
christine berry of beauty without cruelty an animal rights group 
press reports said petition drives were being organized and that 
some activists had vowed to try to physically stop the killings 
south africas department of environmental affairs said the 
killings would be carried out humanely first by clubbing the seals 
to stun them and then stabbing them in the heart 
the government said it would intervene if the killings were not 
carried out humanely

the whiteminority government 
and the african national congress could soon negotiate a ceasefire 
after almost 30 years of hostilities a leading anc official 
predicts 
joe slovo an anc leader and the head of the south african 
communist party said thursday the government and the anc would 
seek to work out a ceasefire once they resolve several preliminary 
issues 
in another development president fw de klerk declared six 
neighborhoods open to all races as part of the governments plan to 
ease four decades of strict residential segregation 
on thursday the president approved the integration of six 
relatively small neighborhoods that include one suburb each in 
johannesburg and cape town a rural area outside durban and parts 
of three small towns knysna messina and zuurbekom the 
government opened four neighborhoods to all races in november 
neighborhoods along with public schools and the political 
system are the main institutions still segregated in south africa 
the government and the anc held their first talks in may and 
have since worked together on a document to remove the obstacles to 
fullscale constitutional negotiations 
slovo in an interview expressed optimism about negotiating 
with the government on a new constitution and an end to apartheid 
there is a good chance that if the obstacles are removed we 
will at a very early stage move toward the negotiation of a 
suspension of hostilities he said 
the obstacles he said include the return of 20000 anc exiles 
and the release of about 3000 activists convicted of politically 
motivated crimes 
the government wants the anc to renounce its largely dormant 
guerrilla campaign in order to improve the climate for 
negotiations the question of violence has been one of the most 
contentious issues between the government and the anc 
president bush who hosted anc leader nelson mandela at the 
white house on monday also urged the organization to disavow 
violence 
however mandela and other anc leaders continue to support the 
armed struggle saying it is necessary to maintain pressure on the 
government and also as a measure of selfdefense 
the anc the countrys largest opposition group has not carried 
out any major attacks this year dozens of antiapartheid 
demonstrators have been killed by police during the same period 
the government says it approves of the document while the anc 
has requested until july 10 to respond no details have been 
released 
slovo fled south africa in 1963 he returned from the ancs 
exile headquarters in zambia as part of the 11member delegation 
that met with the government last month he previously headed the 
ancs armed wing which was launched in 1961 a year after the anc 
was outlawed 
his influential south african communist party has been closely 
allied with the anc since the 1920s and several people hold top 
posts in both organizations

nelson mandelas brief visit here was 
shunned by local politicians and denounced by cuban exiles but 
hailed by blacks as a triumphant message of hope in racially 
divided south florida 
the south african antiapartheid leader enjoyed warm receptions 
in every other city on his us tour but most elected officials 
here boycotted his speech to a labor convention about 300 
protesters denounced him 
concerned for his safety a state department security team 
persuaded the 71yearold mandela to leave for detroit on thursday 
without stopping at a park in miamis predominantly black liberty 
city neighborhood where about 1500 supporters had hoped to catch a 
glimpse of the south african antiapartheid leader 
im very embarrassed said willie haywood a 34yearold 
postal worker who joined more than 2000 supporters trying to 
offset the official neglect with a festive rally outside the miami 
beach convention center 
they had tickertape parades for him in new york and hundreds 
of thousands saw him speak in boston haywood said now we have 
the distinction of being the most racist city in america 
miami mayor xavier suarez and every other cubanborn politician 
in the area rescinded welcome plans last week after mandela refused 
on national television to disavow his gratitude toward cuban 
president fidel castro for past support 
in the same broadcast mandela also cited palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat and libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
for their help in the early years of the antiapartheid struggle 
while area jewish leaders said the comments were troubling only a 
few jewish people joined the demonstration against mandela 
mandela did not directly acknowledge the controversy in his 
speech to the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees union 
to be welcomed by those who hold the reins of power in this 
area to be warmly received by residents of miami is a source of 
great inspiration to us mandela said to the cheering crowd 
inside the cavernous hall 
out in the street his supporters strained to listen to portable 
radios as protesters traded slogans on megaphones many blacks said 
they were embittered by the experience and chanted free south 
florida others promised to retaliate on election day and hoped 
mandelas visit would prove a powerful force for change 
the spirit of unity is here the sleeping giant is awake and 
its going to reflect itself in the reconstruction of the black 
community in south florida said ray fauntroy director of the 
southern christian leadership conference in miami 
blacks and hispanics have long been at odds in the metropolitan 
miami area where innercity riots erupted three times in the 1980s 
and only two black elected officials remain in local governments 
dominated by cubanamericans 
but racial divisions seemed particularly stark thursday as 
police set up barricades and struggled to keep the mostly black 
promandela crowd separated from the cuban exiles who burned a 
soviet flag and shouted down with mandela 
were not singling out mandelas cause we are opposed to 
anyone who does not oppose castro said rafael cabezas a veteran 
of the failed bay of pigs invasion 
they should be here with the keys to the city countered joe 
cook 40 who wore long dreadlocks and an african medallion on his 
chest anybody who turns his back on him is a little bitty man 
police broke up several scuffles between the factions and 
quickly ushered away two selfdescribed white supremacists who 
carried signs saying fight communism support the afrikaner 
resistance movement 
mandela supporters sang and musicians in traditional african 
costumes pounded a steady drumbeat as they waited for the 
antiapartheid leaders motorcade hundreds of people sprinted 
around the block in hopes of catching a bit of history when he 
finally pulled into a side entrance 
i saw him i saw mandela shouted rovan locke the publisher 
of miamibased caribbean commentary magazine such a great human 
being in my midst its the greatest feeling in my life

government troops in a northeastern 
village have discovered a mass grave with the bodies of 14 
sinhalese policemen captured by tamil rebels military officials 
said today 
in another development the government declared an indefinite 
curfew today in the coastal town of batticaloa 135 miles east of 
colombo and conducted housetohouse searches for rebels 
the officials in colombo speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the policemens bodies were found thursday at uppuveli village 
near trincomalee 145 miles northeast of colombo 
the victims who had been fatally shot were among 46 policemen 
captured by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam when the rebels 
took over the uppuveli police station two weeks ago said the 
officials the fate of the others was not known 
the tigers overran a string of police stations along the eastern 
coast starting june 11 after a tamil man in batticaloa told the 
rebels he had been manhandled by sinhalese police 
government forces launched an offensive and soon forced the 
rebels to retreat into the jungles and swamps in the east military 
officials believe the tigers retreat may be a tactical move to 
launch a protracted guerrilla war 
at least 1731 combatants and an unknown but large number of 
civilians have been killed in the fighting 
in jaffna town 185 miles north of colombo rebels continued 
their siege of a garrison in a 200yearold fort in the center of 
the town pounding its stone walls with mortars and rockets about 
225 policemen and soldiers are holed up in the fort 
its capture by the rebels would be a major blow to the 
government which now has only four military installations in the 
north under its control the palali airfield near the fort is also 
besieged 
the government controls two naval bases in the peninsula 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne acknowledged thursday 
that many civilians were killed when the air force strafed and 
bombed jaffna town in an attempt to break the siege he blamed 
pilot error 
the rebels have said hundreds of houses have been burned by 
incendiary bombs 
tamil rebels have waged a war for a separate homeland in the 
north and the east since 1983 the fighting has claimed more than 
12600 lives 
the latest round of fighting ended a 13month ceasefire 
negotiated by the government of president ranasinghe premadasa in 
may 1989 with the tamil tigers 
tamil separatists claim their community is discriminated against 
by the majority predominantly buddhist sinhalese 
accounting for 75 percent of the islands 16 million people 
sinhalese dominate the government and the military tamils who are 
mostly hindus comprise 18 percent of the population

a us soldier accused of smuggling medieval 
treasures out of germany near the end of world war ii confided to a 
longtime friend that he took the trove a newspaper reported today 
for years before his death in 1980 joe t meador was torn over 
whether to keep the artwork or return it owen hunsaker meadors 
college classmate in the 1930s told the dallas morning news 
when he looked at it hed get a dreary transported look on 
his face because he knew what he had he loved it and he 
couldnt part with it hunsaker was quoted as saying 
he struggled with that a lot said hunsaker a 71yearold 
retired airline executive who lives in new york 
hunsaker said his friend told him he found the treasures in a 
cave in 1945 in quedlinburg now in east germany and had simply 
wrapped them in brown paper and used an army post office to ship 
them to his home in whitewright 60 miles north of dallas 
hunsaker is the first person to explain how meador allegedly 
discovered the artwork and moved it reports about the case first 
surfaced in the new york times two weeks ago 
the treasures included manuscripts crucifixes and ancient 
coins which church officials said were gifts to the quedlinburg 
cathedral from germanys earliest kings 
lawyers for the lutheran church of quedlinburg contend that 
meador stole the treasures while serving as an army lieutenant 
among troops that occupied the area in april 1945 
meador left the cache to his brother and sister jack meador and 
jane meador cook they are disputing the churchs claim of 
ownership and trying to keep the items which are worth millions 
the meador family is asking the churchs permission to display 
the treasures at the dallas museum of art or the kimball art museum 
in fort worth while the lawsuit over ownership is pending the news 
reported today 
we have not as yet spoken with either museum the familys 
attorney randal mathis told the newspaper we think that they 
would be appropriate places for safekeeping 
hunsaker was in the pacific during world war ii while his friend 
fought in germany he said that during a visit to whitewright in 
1948 meador showed him artwork that he said he had wrapped in 
brown paper marked as old books and deposited in a mailbox at 
army headquarters 
he said meador told him that he found the artwork in 1945 in a 
cave filled with treasures of gold and silver and filled his army 
jacket with as many treasures as he could hold before returning 
to his headquarters 
us army reports indicate the treasures were removed from a 
mine shaft near quedlinburg within three days after allied troops 
occupied the area in april 1945 
hunsaker the news reported said meador did not tell him 
whether anyone helped him remove the artwork or whether he returned 
to the cave later to get more items 
he said they sat for hours paging through a manuscript with an 
elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels and highlighted with 
a silver figure of jesus christ with his hand risen in benediction 
it was unbelievable hunsaker said i knew i was touching 
ancient history 
hunsaker said he frequently tried but failed to persuade meador 
to turn over the artwork to authorities 
joe knew he had a hot potato said hunsaker he couldnt 
let everybody know about it and he certainly couldnt sell it 
hunsaker said he last talked to meador a few years before he 
died

human bones brought by vietnamese 
refugees earlier this month were not those of us servicemen 
missing in action the us embassy said today 
the refugees had said the remains were those of american mias 
embassy press officer meg gilroy said the 32 sets of remains had 
been examined by a forensic team from the armys central 
identification laboratory in hawaii 
they did not find the remains of any americans she said 
on june 12 nine vietnamese refugees landed on tanjung sedili 
beach 150 miles southeast of kuala lumpur with seven barrels 
stuffed with bones they claimed the bones were those of soldiers 
killed in vietnam 
the skeletons had dog tags on them but gilroy said none of the 
names on the dog tags were those of americans missing in action in 
the vietnam war which ended with the communist victory in 1975 
the united states now lists 2303 americans as missing in the 
indochina war these include 1678 in vietnam 
 
the refugees said they had intended to bring the remains to 
singapore and hand them over to us officials and in exchange 
seek preferential treatment for settlement in the united states 
they said they landed in malaysia instead of singapore because 
their boat began to leak singapore is about 60 miles south of 
where they landed embassy officials said even if the remains had 
been those of american servicemen it would not have affected the 
refugees applications to enter the united states 
the refugees were taken to a malaysian refugee camp for 
screening

its not all nerds and napoleons when the masters 
of fantasy and war games hold a convention but the masked people 
in black capes and uniformed guys hunched over little battlefields 
enjoy being bizarre 
according to bestselling author tom clancy who was scoping out 
the scene thursday some even look neurotic 
there are some bona fide nuts here people who think dungeons 
and dragons is real said clancy author of the hunt for red 
october clear and present danger and other military 
thrillers but there are also some bona fide experts from the 
military and what they have to say is real 
the 16th annual origins 90 convention gives gamers from 
all over the country a chance to see whos the best wizard warrior 
or soldier in their favorite games three hundred companies are 
showing their new wares at the atlanta hilton and the opening day 
crowd numbered in the thousands 
what is it halloween already shrieked a hotel guest as she 
almost ran into a ninjalooking creature with a skull for a head 
this is weird 
military strategy games have been around as long as the ancient 
egyptians who planned battle moves with clay figures in the sand 
the military still uses similar tactics to a degree 
fantasy games are largely the invention of gary gygax who 
invented the popular dungeons and dragons roleplaying game in 1974 
fantasy players like to dress up and wander around 
its probably kind of weird if you dont know about role 
playing said ben rhoades as he prepared to play a threeday 
marathon ars magica wizardry game you probably think were all 
nerds were not mainstream 
then theres the board game warhammer 40000k where players 
fred shallowford and charlie traylor insist that the 20th century 
as we know it doesnt actually exist because aliens transformed the 
milky way in the middle ages the earth is now dominated by gene 
stealers and imperial space marines 
the battles take place on painstakingly realistic miniature 
battlefields 
its a way of life some people fish this is what i do 
traylor explained 
then there are the battle strategy games where the military 
buffs shine 
retired marine maj robert murawski took a long look at the game 
on watch where american soldiers in world war ii were trying to 
take over a gestapo units headquarters and fired one of his tanks 
the result as determined by tape measure total destruction of 
a natural gas pump the german soldiers hiding at its top and a 
cloud of smoke that would obscure the american platoon as it 
advanced 
this is war you take what you can when you can said 
murawski a former project manager for the marine corps war games 
that is what clancy came to see he doesnt have time to play 
war games but clancy who taught himself the intricacies of 
military technology through books concedes he might learn 
something for a future book 
there are some really smart people here but there are some 
even bigger nuts but even some of the nuts are experts

sipping sacred rice wine in a shrine to the sun 
goddess emperor akihitos youngest son and his college sweetheart 
were wed today as millions of japanese watched on television 
flanked by imperial ritualists prince aya 24 and kiko 
kawashima 23 knelt together in the imperial palace shrine to the 
goddess amaterasu from whom legend says the royal family is 
descended 
miss kawashima a graduate student is the second commoner to 
marry into the royal family and the marriage was seen as another 
step in bringing the imperial palace and japans people closer 
together 
the ceremony also was being hailed as the publics first taste 
of the new imperial era called heisei or achieving peace 
which began with the death of emperor hirohito on jan 7 1989 
the new emperor akihito has been credited with trying to 
create a more open softer image for japans often distant and 
mysterious imperial family 
still much of todays wedding cermony was in line with japanese 
traditions going back more than 1000 years 
the prince speaking the classical japanese used by priests of 
japans indigenous shinto religion recited vows to the sun 
goddess the couple sealed their nuptial bonds by sipping sacred 
rice wine from a white ceramic cup 
aya was clad in a black silk robe and cap with an arched 
tailpiece signifying his royal rank the bride wore a green maroon 
and orange kimono nearly a dozen layers thick and reportedly 
weighing 50 pounds 
the princess preparations for the wedding which began before 
dawn included a purification ritual and the coiffing of her hair 
in the elaborate court fashion of a thousand years ago 
police say that because of threats from leftist radicals 9000 
officers were assigned to guard the wedding activities though most 
were being held at either the imperial palace which is surrounded 
by a moat and forbidding stone walls or the akasaka palace the 
wellsecured residence of the emperor and empress 
the wedding was the first for an imperial family member in six 
years and the first in three decades for a prince of ayas rank 
aya is second in line to the chrysanthemum throne after his elder 
brother crown prince naruhito 30 who has yet to marry 
empress michiko became the first commoner to marry into the 
family when she and akihito then crown prince wed in 1959 
in keeping with tradition the emperor and empress were absent 
from the ceremony at the shrine but were receiving the couple 
later at the palace 
i am praying for their happiness the emperor said in a 
statement after the ceremony 
the princess followed a few steps behind the prince as they 
entered the outer sanctuary of the wooden kashikodokoro shrine 
prime minister toshiki kaifu and other government leaders and 
imperial family members were among about 150 guests watching from 
outside 
foreign ambassadors were not invited to the ceremony but were 
to attend a tea party at the palace on saturday 
japans television networks preempted regular programs to carry 
the ceremony and related events live 
aya was given a new title prince akishino to mark his 
establishing of an independent household akishino is the name of a 
town in western japan with close ties to the imperial family 
this is the first big event of the heisei era said former 
imperial chamberlain minoru hamao who served as a close attendant 
to akihito for 20 years 
the princess is the perfect person for todays imperial 
household and im sure that as time goes on she will gradually 
help bring the monarchy even closer to the people he said in an 
interview 
miss kawashima has won public affection with her warm smile and 
quiet manner because of her relatively humble background her 
father is an economics professor at gakushuin university a former 
peers school she was called a modernday cinderella 
she was also dubbed the apartment princess because she lived 
with her family in faculty housing on the gakushuin campus where 
she is working on her masters degree in social psychology 
i feel tense as i think about becoming a member of the 
imperial family and recognize the responsibilities the princess 
wrote in a letter carried today by the daily newspaper asahi 
shimbun 
she said she wanted to lead a happy life with prince aya under 
the refreshing sky 
aya a gakushuin graduate met miss kawashima at a bookstore on 
the campus in 1985 their engagement was approved by the government 
in september 
the royal couples first trip together will be to the grand 
shrines of ise and the tomb of the emperor jimmu both in central 
japan emperor jimmu according to myth was japans first monarch 
and ascended in 660 bc 
after the ceremony the couple went by motorcade from the 
imperial palace to akasaka palace where they will live near the 
emperor and empress crowds lined the motorcades route and the 
new princess wearing a diamond diamond tiara smiled and waved

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and four fellow democrats are calling for the united 
states to use resources and technology from military cutbacks to 
improve the environment 
majority members of the senate armed services committee led by 
panel chairman sen sam nunn of georgia proposed on thursday 
creating a strategic environmental research program to use the 
skills of the defense and energy departments and some elements of 
the intelligence community 
the resources once used in a military role would be directed to 
environmental programs under the proposal to be included in the 
1991 defense spending bill 
i believe that one of our key national security objectives 
must be to reverse the accelerating pace of environmental 
destruction around the globe nunn said in a speech on the senate 
floor 
sen albert gore jr dtenn said the nation is realizing 
that its security can be threatened by other forces 
we must certainly give the highest standing to the 
consequences of a damaged and destabilized natural environment 
gore said 
a new defense environmental research council would develop a 
fiveyear program for environmental research using data collection 
and analysis alternative energy technologies and environmental 
cleanup technology 
the purpose of the council would be to coordinate research on 
the link between human action and the environment assess the 
damage done by the defense and energy departments to the land and 
water develop technology to correct the problems and then give 
that information to the private sector and other countries 
our real peace dividend will consist of the research talent 
that will be made available as our defense establishment is reduced 
thousands of highly trained and educated scientists engineers 
and technicians nunn said 
the proposal which carries no cost estimate will be ironed out 
as the senate committee begins crafting a defense bill sometime 
next month 
joining nunn and gore in proposing the legislation were sens

president hashemi rafsanjani said today that 
iran should be thankful for foreign aid for earthquake victims 
defending the help against hardliners who oppose it 
rafsanjani speaking a weekly prayers at tehran university 
cited an editorial in a radical newspaper last week that denounced 
assistance from countries like the united states and said people 
chanted death to america even from under the rubble 
i dont think we see the people who are under the debris 
saying no we dont want foreign aid the president said the 
response and activities of the foreigners were really good and 
acceptable 
the antiwestern faction in the iranian government led by 
lawmaker ali akbar mohtashemi opposes any form of foreign 
assistance to the islamic republic in the wake of last thursdays 
devastating earthquake 
rafsanjani has sought to open iran to more foreign investment as 
a means of gaining technology to rebuild the sagging economy 
he made no link today between western aid and the release of 
us and other western hostages held by proiranian groups in 
lebanon but iran has said western gestures of goodwill could 
prompt iran to further help obtain the hostages freedom 
the united states broke diplomatic relations with iran after 
islamic radicals seized the us embassy in tehran in november 1979 
and held 52 hostages for 444 days 
recent emergency aid from western countries including the 
united states for the hundreds of thousands of victims of the 
earthquake has raised speculation about a possible thawing of 
relations 
the assistance has an effect nobody can say it doesnt 
said an iranian diplomatic official speaking on condition of 
anonymity but he added that the us government has missed an 
opportunity because of the small size of its donation 
the 295000 the united states is giving is like a joke he 
said its the amount of one house in california 
he was referring to the value of supplies donated by the us 
government that was airlifted to iran on sunday on a red cross 
charter flight the shipment included blankets tents water jugs 
and searchandrescue equipment 
the united states on wednesday announced it would send another 
shipment of emergency supplies bringing the total us government 
contribution to about 760000 
but that figure is still below the aid provided by some other 
countries sweden has already donated 3 million in quake aid and 
north korea announced it would give 1 million worth of supplies 
the official said the main issue in improving usiranian 
relations is the freeing of iranian assets frozen in the united 
states 
it would have a positive effect he said although some 
claims were recently settled with iran the bulk of the assets 
remain frozen 
the official indicated that the release of the six remaining 
american hostages in lebanon was an issue separate from earthquake 
aid 
he said iranian officials did their best to obtain the release 
of two us hostages robert polhill and frank reed who were freed 
in april by their proiranian shiite moslem kidnappers in beirut 
but he indicated that irans help in gaining the release of more 
us hostages is contingent on us efforts to help free four 
iranians kidnapped in july 1982 by lebanese christian militiamen 
we were surprised at the lack of response from the united 
states over the recent release of us hostages with iranian 
help the official said in some ways we have influence over 
the release of additional hostages but this is the time for you 
to do something 
the bush administration recently provided information to iran 
through the swiss government which washington said indicated the 
four men were dead but iranian officials insist they are still 
alive 
sixteen western hostages are believed held by shiite moslem 
militants in lebanon the longestheld hostage is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped in march 1985

east germanys prime minister is predicting a 
full merger by the end of the year calling for the same timetable 
as west german officials a newspaper reported today 
lothar de maiziere the countrys first democratically elected 
leader also added that a compromise must be found to eliminate 
soviet objections to nato membership for unified germany 
on sunday east germany and west germany embark on the mammoth 
task of joining their two economies the former troubled weakling 
and the latter a worldleading powerhouse 
in an interview with the east german newspaper neue zeit de 
maiziere predicted that a 35nation european summit will approve 
the unification plan at its meeting in paris in november 
he said he was confident that by the end of the year we can 
clear up all of the internal and international problems to 
complete unification according to neue zeit which is closely 
allied with de maizieres christian democrats 
west german officials have called for combined german elections 
for early december with full national unification to take place 
the following day 
de maiziere however did not offer any specific ways to 
overcome soviet reservations to unification 
the soviet union has 380000 troops stationed in east germany 
once the front line of the cold war with the west and the kremlin 
has balked at allowing a united germany to be exclusively a member 
of the western nato military alliance 
in the final days before currency union leaders from both sides 
today urged east germans to be cautious in spending the thousands 
of west german marks most of them will get sunday 
financial experts are worried that a sudden unfettered buying 
spree would derail efforts to join the two economies smoothly 
west german finance minister theo waigel urged east germans to 
save or invest their money as their country shifts from 40 years of 
socialism to capitalism 
waigels east german counterpart walter romberg provided some 
of the most elementary advice to a people long accustomed to 
snatching up whatever they can to hedge against frequent shortages 
the market economy will allow us to buy what we need and to 
choose among many offers romberg said so no more buying at 
any price and no more uneconomical stocking up 
de maiziere came to power after the countrys first free 
elections in march that ousted the communists the balloting 
followed last falls ouster of communist hardliners amid massive 
demonstrations

troops and paramilitary police shut down 
the nations main university campus today after a predawn assault 
in which they beat many students and ordered thousands to pack 
their bags 
witnesses said one student was killed but this report could not 
be immediately confirmed 
at least 27 students accused of inciting four days of bloody 
unrest were dragged from their rooms beaten and taken into 
custody the students said 
thousands of students were herded with their belongings onto the 
main lawn of the campus where they were surrounded by police and 
troops in full combat gear witnesses said 
a senior police official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the campus had been closed indefinitely groups of students 
were ferried to bus stops at gunpoint 
there was no immediate comment from university authorities on 
the shutdown of the school 
one student said students barricaded themselves in their rooms 
when security forces launched their predawn assault but that 
troops broke down doors and fired their weapons 
the action came after studentled protests against cuts in food 
price subsidies earlier in the week that flared into countrywide 
rioting against the oneparty socialist government of president 
kenneth kaunda at least 23 people died in the violence 
elsewhere in lusaka the capital of this southcentral african 
nation residents returned to work and schools reopened 
kaunda had said that he would disclose today the date for a 
referendum on whether the country should restore a multiparty 
system the students are demanding westernstyle democracy 
in addition to the 23 people killed hundreds of alleged looters 
were wounded in rioting this week the bloodiest urban unrest since 
independence from britian in 1964 
this weeks unrest began after the government cut subsidies for 
corn meal doubling the price of the staple 
more than 30 student leaders have been detained under security 
laws and at least four were shot and wounded in clashes with armed 
police since monday 
on thursday as an uneasy calm returned to most major cities and 
towns defiant students demanding kaundas resignation prepared 
gasoline bombs and vowed to defend themselves against the security 
forces 
students appeared not to have used petrol bombs early today as 
troops destroyed banners that said down with kaunda and 
kaunda must resign the murderer must go 
throughout the capital work gangs cleared rubble and makeshift 
barricades from the roads and some public buses were running 
the main courthouse was sealed off and officials said some 
demonstrators would be brought before magistrates later today 
kaunda has promised to crack down on what he described as criminal 
stampedes and thuggery by protesters 
kaunda led the former british colony of northern rhodesia to 
independence as zambia 26 years ago he declared a oneparty state 
in 1972 
the increase in the price of corn meal was announced as part of 
an economic reform program aimed at reducing government subsidies 
and making the economy of zambia one of africas poorest nations 
more commercially viable 
the program was recommended by financial agencies and donor 
nations however it increased popular discontent with kaunda who 
is among a group of african rulers besieged by demands for 
democratic reforms kaunda said the economic reform program would 
continue despite the unrest

two weeks after a flood that devastated an 
eastern ohio village and killed at least 24 people the search for 
victims has ended 
by nightfall thursday the army corps of engineers and a private 
contractor had given up sifting through debris for victims at the 
hannibal locks and dam on the ohio river 
the search had been centered on the dam about 27 miles 
downstream from shadyside since flooding on june 14 cranes 
mounted on barges were used to scoop through debris that collected 
around the intake of a power plant at the dam 
as of thursday night nine names remained on the list of those 
missing since the flood only two of those were known to live in 
the area before the flooding said army corps of engineers 
spokesman steven wright the other seven were people who had lived 
in the area at one time for whom their current residences are 
unknown authorities said 
the other seven were unconfirmed but i think authorities 
erred on the side of safety in reporting the possible missing 
wright said they put out the names and got no response 
wright said only a small amount of the 20000 cubic yards of 
debris remained leaving little hope that any other victims would 
be found there

officials and newspaper commentators today welcomed 
an agreement on economic reform in the united states and japan as a 
first major step toward easing trade tensions 
expectations of higher interest rates here linked to the trade 
agreement however dealt a blow to the dollar and to tokyo stock 
prices analysts said 
japanese and american trade officials promised drastic changes 
in both countries after four days of negotiations that ended late 
thursday 
the final report on the talks called the structural impediments 
initiative ended a series of negotiations on policy changes aimed 
at shrinking japans 49 billion trade surplus with the united 
states 
officials acknowledged that the agreement appeared to amount to 
meddling by each country in the others economy but they stressed 
that the success of the talks indicated the approach was 
constructive 
the agreement could serve as an example in approaching economic 
disputes among other countries foreign ministry spokesman taizo 
watanabe said today 
i think its going to be accepted that we can do these sorts 
of things globally he said no economies are completely 
isolated 
at japans urging the united states agreed to take stronger 
action to reduce the federal budget deficit washington pledged to 
pursue policies aimed at promoting exports increasing the 
competitiveness of us businesses and improving education and 
worker training 
japan said it would adopt widerranging reforms aimed at 
stimulating demand for imports and improving living standards they 
included much higher levels of public spending changes in 
regulations on land use and retail distribution and harsher 
measures against unfair business practices 
in this age of mutual economic dependence we hope that the 
sii talks will serve as a new international model for economic 
administration as nations increasingly bond together to form 
common markets the need for such a model grows the 
masscirculation yomiuri shimbun said in an editorial 
we are now in an economic era without national borders said 
the asahi shimbun sovereignty is no longer what it used to be 
for any nation we feel inclined to accept as a product of such a 
new era the sii talks 
the englishlanguage japan times said the long and difficult 
process of the talks has clearly shown that these two pacific 
trading partners are entering a new phase of their mutual 
relationship 
but it said the real sii talks may have just started the 
two nations will probably need to carry out even more drastic 
structural harmonization 
watanabe said the real impact of the agreement would depend on 
actions taken to carry it out 
weve got to be dead serious in implementing what we have 
agreed thats something to be concerned about now he said 
japanese officials played down suggestions that the agreement 
given japans wider concessions was onesided 
watanabe said japanese officials viewed bushs decision to relax 
his no new taxes stand and accept raising tax revenues to 
reduce the budget deficit as a sign that the americans were very 
serious about the reciprocity of the talks 
our side also made suggestions that might be construed as an 
interference in us domestic issues foreign minister taro 
nakayama said 
if the people are fully informed of the new measures i 
believe they will understand that these measures are something that 
must be implemented in order to improve their own living 
standard he said 
the immediate economic impact of the agreement was fear that 
increased public spending would lead to higher interest rates in 
japan to curb inflation analysts said this discouraged both 
japanese stock investors and potential dollar buyers they said 
the dollar closed the week at 15285 yen down 157 yen from 
thursdays close of 15442 yen the nikkei stock average the key 
index of the tokyo stock exchange fell 16595 points or 052 
percent to 3194024

writers request that billy the kid be pardoned for his role in the 
1878 shooting death of sheriff william brady 
a letter is being prepared telling las cruces author opal lee 
priestley of the governors decision bj wagneradam the 
governors administrator of pardons and extraditions said 
thursday ms priestley is the author of billy the kid the good 
side of a bad man 
hundreds of living people have clemency cases pending with just 
six months left in the carruthers administration said ms 
wagneradam said 
she said a full investigation of all facts surrounding the case 
would be impossible because it happened so long ago 
theres such a volume of information out there and so much we 
dont know she said 
the writer contended that the kid was denied a fair trial 
it was generally considered by those who attended the trial 
that he got token representation and it was a foregone conclusion 
he would be found guilty ms priestley said there was not 
much doubt the cards were stacked against him 
he escaped after the trial killing two lincoln county deputies 
ms priestley said perhaps hundreds of people knew where he was 
after that but would not betray him for a 500 reward 
and 500 in those days was a fortune ms priestley said 
the kid whose real name was said to be william bonney or henry 
mccarty was shot to death in fort sumner nm by lincoln county 
sheriff pat garrett in 1881

land taken from production under the 
conservation reserve program may be used for haying and livestock 
grazing in qualified counties where drought has reduced feed 
supplies the agriculture department announced 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said late thursday that 
all determinations would be on a countybycounty basis 
the crp as it is called allows farmers to take highly erodible 
cropland from production for 10 years and collect annual rental 
payments from the government in return the land must be planted 
to protective grass or trees 
we would prefer not to hay or graze crp lands yeutter said 
we are responding to isolated situations with a cautious prudent 
program that sustains the environmental protections that are the 
heart of the crp 
to be eligible counties must use updated data to show rainfall 
andor forage production is at least 40 percent below normal 
in general the restrictions are much tighter than those 
governing haying and grazing on crp land in previous drought 
situations the announcement said 
the program will be handled by state and county offices of the 
departments agricultural stabilization and conservation service

nelson mandela received a tumultuous welcome in 
the nations industrial heartland revitalizing the south african 
antiapartheid leaders us tour after political leaders in miami 
rebuffed him 
in florida on thursday cubanamerican mayors snubbed mandela 
because of his support for cuban leader fidel castro but later in 
the day detroit showered mandela with affection and at least 15 
million to support his dream of a racially united south africa 
we appreciate your efforts especially in this time of 
industrial retrenchment in the face of your problems and 
difficulties you have not forgotten us we will never forget 
you mandela told a crowd of 49000 at tiger stadium 
shortly after dawn today mandela left his downtown hotel for a 
halfhour stroll along the detroit river which marks the border 
between detroit and windsor ontario 
flanked by police and state department security agents he shook 
hands with wellwishers and signed autographs he wore a detroit 
pistons jacket and cap that members of the championship pro 
basketball team gave him thursday night 
in a morning news conference before departing for los angeles 
mandela said the first six stops of the us tour have been 
successful beyond our wildest dreams 
he said the twin messages of ending racial separation in south 
africa and continuing economic sanctions against the whiteminority 
government have been heard 
detroit was the sixth stop on mandelas eightcity us tour and 
the only midwestern city he was scheduled to speak at a news 
conference this morning before heading for los angeles later today 
weary from the rigors of his tour mandela 71 seemed energized 
by the wildly cheering crowds that greeted him in detroit which he 
called motor town 
thank you for giving us your support when we need you most 
mandela said at tiger stadium 
right now i wish i could climb down from the stage and join 
you in the stands and embrace you one and all 
mandela referred to words of a song by motowns marvin gaye 
it says brother brother theres far too many of you dying 
mother mother theres far too many of you crying mandela 
said quoting the late singers 1971 classic whats going on 
many who glimpsed mandela said they were overwhelmed 
he has touched my life in an unforgettable manner and has made 
me so proud of our heritage said wynetta frazier of chicago a 
professor at the university of illinois ive never felt that 
before 
mandela was freed in february after 27 years in a south african 
prison for plotting sabotage to overthrow the countrys minority 
white government 
in his first stop here mandela donned a united auto workers 
jacket and cap as he addressed about 1300 people at a suburban 
ford motor co assembly plant 
the man who stands before you is not a stranger mandela 
told cheering auto workers i am a member of the uaw i am your 
flesh and blood i am your comrade 
it was the first ceremonial shutdown of the assembly line since 
a tribute to mark the death of henry ford ii in 1987 
employee dellar lewis 51 said just being in mandelas presence 
was an honor im proud to be a part of it 
mayor coleman young detroits first black mayor predicted 
before thursday that mandela would leave detroit with at least 1 
million for his african national congress which is pressing for an 
end to south africas apartheid system of racial segregation 
but at least 15 million had been raised by wednesday with 
more expected after donations given at tiger stadium were counted 
young spokesman bob berg said 
mandela continued to urge economic sanctions against south 
africa 
we dont want apartheid to survive even one more day he 
said so long as it survives it will continue to shed the blood 
of our people including children 
the warm reception in detroit where young and gov james 
blanchard greeted mandela as he stepped off the plane was in sharp 
contrast to miami 
angered by his statements last week praising castro palestine 
liberation organization head yasser arafat and libyas moammar 
gadhafi for their aid to the anc mayors of the miami areas major 
cities refused to greet mandela 
however about 2000 supporters gathered outside the miami beach 
convention center and along his route mandela made no direct 
comment on the official slight 
to be welcomed by those who hold the reins of power in this 
area to be warmly received by residents of miami is the source of 
great inspiration to us said mandela he appealed for help from 
us labor unions in a speech to delegates at the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees convention 
about 300 antimandela demonstrators mostly cubanamericans 
waved placards blasting him for his defense of castro 
police kept the two groups separated although they shouted back 
and forth with megaphones and at least one fistfight was broken up

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference friday at the white house 
bush good morning everybody and im leaving in a few hours and 
will be gone from washington for several days congress is about to 
close up shop for the 4th of july holidays and so i thought it 
would be a good idea to bring you up to date on a wide array of 
current topics and respond to your questions 
during the next two weeks the us will join its allies in 
considering a number of crucial political security and 
international economic issues and seldom in the last 40 years have 
such questions had such direct impact on the lives of all 
americans today in the us we are carefully examining the historic 
changes in eastern europe the size of our military forces our 
ability to compete in world markets the assistance that we provide 
to help emerging democracies and the size and priorities of our 
own budget and how to continue the 90 months of economic expansion 
that weve enjoyed 
these issues are not abstract every american has a stake in how 
we as a nation address these very complex questions 
on july 5th and 6th in london the nato alliance will gather to 
forge a new direction for the future and at the houston economic 
summit we will press for progress in the uruguay round of trade 
negotiations discuss economic support for various countries and 
review progress on the environment 
these international concerns are reflected in many of the 
decisions i made just this week first we are doing what is 
necessary to assure continuation of the economic expansion now in 
its 90th month and we want to keep it going we now estimate a 
deficit of over 150 billion in fiscal 1991 not counting the costs 
of the savings and loan cleanup and this means that unless 
congress acts there will be a cutoff in october of nearly 100 
billion in government services under the sequester provisions of 
the grammrudmanhollings 
the potential results are draconian cuts in defense student 
grants and a wide array of other necessary domestic services and 
to avoid this tough decisions must be made and leadership is 
needed and that is exactly what administration officials are 
seeking to provide and indeed in these talks i believe are 
providing 
the budget negotiations now under way are a makeorbreak effort 
at responsible government the congressional budgeting process must 
succeed and the negotiators are facing tough questions about where 
to make cuts and where to raise the revenues and these are not 
decisions that anyone relishes they are decisions that democrats 
and republicans alike have got to face with candor and courage 
and frankly i believe that ultimately good politics is rooted 
in good government and im optimistic that we can get a budget 
agreement legislated which not only tells the world that america 
puts its fiscal house in order but also will garner the full 
support of the american people 
secondly this week we reached an agreement with the japanese on 
the structural impediments initiative thats going to help to 
open markets and create new opportunities for business and 
commerce next we took an important step toward increasing jobs 
opportunity and economic prosperity throughout our own hemisphere 
enterprise for the americas an innovative and i think visionary 
plan for increased trade and investment with latin america and the 
caribbean and the response from south of our border has been 
overwhelmingly positive and this included a new proposal on 
official debt in the hemisphere which will help our neighbors in 
latin america and the caribbean resume the process of growth 
we developed a plan for protecting our coastal resources this 
ocs decision while also endeavoring to protect energy 
independence and as i leave for the 4th of july holiday and then 
from there to the nato summit and then to the houston economic 
summit i just wanted to assure you that the america america will 
squarely face the challenges of leadership that are before us both 
domestically and in terms of international affairs 
q mr president id like to ask you about your reversal on 
no new taxes do you consider that a betrayal of your promise 
and what do you say to republicans who complain that youve robbed 
them of the same campaign issue that helped get you elected 
bush well i dont i think what i consider it is a necessary 
step to get stalled budget negotiations moving and i am very 
encouraged with the approach taken now by republicans and democrats 
in this in these important discussions that are going on im not 
going to discuss details what ill accept and what i wont accept 
but things are moving and i think that much more important today 
is getting this deficit down continuing economic expansion and 
employment in this country so thats the way id respond to it

lawyers for former gov arch a moore 
jr said he was pressured into pleading guilty to five federal 
corruption charges and wants to withdraw the pleas 
the justice department will ask us district judge walter 
hoffman to deny moores request to rescind his guilty pleas and 
sentence him july 10 said us attorney michael carey on thursday 
moores lawyer filed a motion thursday claiming prosecutors gave 
moore one day to consider a plea bargain and threatened to lodge 
at least 28 charges against him if he didnt agree 
the former threeterm republican governor pleaded guilty may 8 
to extortion mail fraud tax fraud and obstruction of justice 
moore 67 admitted extorting more than 500000 from beckley 
coal operator h paul kizer in return for a 23 million refund 
from the states black lung fund which provides benefits to coal 
miners he also admitted trying to block a federal grand jury 
investigation into corruption in his administration 
moore could get 36 years in prison and 12 million in fines if 
the guilty pleas are upheld officials said 
hoffman was brought in to handle moores case after west 
virginias federal judges asked to be excused officials said 
in a sixpage motion filed by lawyer william g hundley moore 
claimed prosecutors told him at 10 pm on may 7 the day before he 
pleaded guilty they would charge him under federal racketeering 
laws if he did not plead guilty to the five counts 
the motion noted moores pleas were not entered immediately 
after he signed an agreement to admit guilt but these time 
pressures alone are sufficient to warrant the withdrawal of the 
pleas 
but hundley in the motion acknowledged that he had advised 
moore in the strongest of terms to enter the guilty plea after 
the government revealed surreptitiously recorded tapes 
hundley did not describe the tapes but moores indictment said 
he met secretly last february with former 1988 campaign manager 
john leaberry to discuss how they would both lie to a federal grand 
jury 
the government said the meeting allegedly held in a gas station 
parking lot was secretly recorded by fbi agents and leaberry who 
was wearing a hidden microphone 
moore was governor from 1969 to 1977 and again from 1984 to 1988

washington to it 
q well what do you say to can people trust politicians if 
they make statements and are willing to break them 
president bush well you know i recall a previous flurry when 
i was vice president and there was some economic plans proposed 
back in 1982 that caused a furor something like were hearing now 
and the president in my view did what was right and so i i 
think that i think that were on the right track and i think 
that the arrows have been flying front back sideways but thats 
what i get paid for and i think i think were on the right track 
now and i think well have strong support from both sides of the 
aisle 
q mr president do you will believe it will hurt your 
credibility 
bush no not in the long run 
q why not a lot of people are already 
bush because what people are interested in are jobs economic 
growth people know this deficit is bad people know that we are 
going to have to take some action and thats why i think not 
q but what will you say to american people who said you may 
have promised not to no new taxes not 
bush ill say i take a look at a new situation i see an 
enormous deficit i see a savings and loan problem out there that 
has to be resolved and like abraham lincoln said ill think anew 
im not but im not violating or getting away from my fundamental 
conviction on taxes anything of that nature not in the least but 
what i have said is on the table and lets see where we go but 
weve got a different weve got a very important national 
problem and i think the president owes the people his his 
judgment at the moment he has to address that problem and thats 
exactly what im trying to do 
and look i knew id catch some flak on this decision just 
those two words but ive got to do what i think is right and then 
ill ask the people for support but more important than posturing 
now or even negotiating is the result do we continue to provide 
jobs for the american people and do we continue to provide economic 
growth and do we try to stop saddling the generations on the way 
up and the young people with absolutely unacceptable deficits 
q what will you do with the savings and loan situation is 
there any way to do a budget with that still coming out of general 
revenue or do you have to push the whole issue off to the side 
bush well were we cant push it off to the side weve got 
to solve the problem my interest on that one incidentally is to 
protect the depositor put the people that broke the law in jail 
and that is exactly what the policy that we proposed did we came 
in here 18 days after taking office initiated a very important 
savings and loan policy and the size of the savings and loan 
problem is terrible and we are trying very hard to go after the 
criminals and to have in place rules and regulations so that this 
will never happen again and to protect the depositors 
those are the three key elements of what im trying to do 
q but where do you pay for it is it out of the taxes the 
government takes in every year from the american taxpayer 
bush well we have to people are going to have to pay for it 
and thats it goes as a part of all our expenditures im talking 
about there has got to be a remedy 
q mr president on another subject prime minister shamir has 
sent 
bush good michael i was hoping wed get to 
another one 
q well we can go back to these taxes later but prime minister 
shamir has sent you a what appears to be a pretty tough letter 
ruling out flatly talks with any palestinian with any sort of 
authority do you feel the peace process is deadlocked and are you 
concerned that the hardliners the voices of extremism now have the 
upper hand throughout the region

stormie jones the worlds first heartliver 
transplant recipient is battling a perplexing infection attacking 
her second transplanted liver but isnt likely to need a third 
transplant soon doctors said 
we have no silver bullet for this type of hepatitis we dont 
have a specific drug that we can give dr andreas tzakis of 
childrens hospital of pittsburgh said thursday 
at this moment shes not at a great risk of 
transplantation tzakis said the damage is such that she can 
completely recover shes not jaundiced shes feeling well shes 
actually bored being here in the hospital 
stormie 13 of white settlement texas received her first 
injections wednesday of a proteintype substance that bolsters the 
immune system to fight the unknown type of infectious hepatitis 
that threatens to destroy her liver 
she was released from the hospital late thursday but doctors 
said they want her to stay in pittsburgh until the infection is 
controlled her mother will continue giving stormie the injections 
every three days 
doctors slightly reduced the antirejection medication that 
suppresses the immune system so her body can combat the hepatitis 
if the antirejection medication is reduced too much though it 
may lead to the organ rejection stormie has struggled with in the 
past 
shes not in imminent danger of losing her life said 
tzakis shes well shes eating she wants out of here but six 
months from now we want to make sure shes well if we let this 
continue it will destroy her liver 
doctors have determined stormie developed the same type of 
hepatitis that damaged her first transplanted liver in february 
how she contracted the disease is a mystery said dr john fung 
stormie received the worlds first heartliver transplant in 
february 1984 at the age of 6 she received a second liver 
transplant six years later but returned to childrens hospital last 
month after routine tests showed she apparently was rejecting that 
liver 
doctors gave her more of an experimental antirejection drug 
approved for use by the us food and drug administration only at 
childrens and nearby presbyterianuniversity hospitals 
she returned to pittsburgh on saturday after tests showed higher 
enzyme levels indicating infection stormie also felt fatigued

washington has been 
q mr president if it was so comforting and good for the 
country why didnt you do it a year ago 
bush because weve got a problem that is of far greater 
magnitude today because weve had a much slower economy than 
anybody predicted and that has meant revenue shortfalls and that 
means bigger budget deficits and that means more burden for future 
generations of americans and unacceptably high interest rates and 
so that is why i 
q are you saying the economy then is in some kind of trouble 
now that these problems are 
bush im saying the economy is sluggish and i think a deficit 
package that takes care that is seen to be a real one will have 
an ameliorating effect on that and hopefully will result in lower 
interest rates and thus have a more vibrant a more robust economy 
q you talked about the next nato summit as a milestone next 
friday what are we going to see are we going to see a totally 
different nato how different will it be 
bush no but were going to see a nato that makes very clear to 
the world one that its purely defensive and two that it has a 
broadened agenda beside just military building on article ii of 
the nato document the founding document thats what youll see 
and i cant help you with the details because we obviously havent 
even met yet 
q will there be any american proposals there on nato 
bush well i was asked the other day at a meeting with some 
foreign journalists whether there would be i thought i dont 
know if they used the word bombshells but big surprises i 
dont anticipate that but lets wait and see what happens when we 
get there but i dont our the nato goal at this juncture 
should be to convince president gorbachev that a reconstituted 
nato with germany as a full member is not a threat to the soviet 
union but rather is a provides stability for europe and thus will 
guarantee the continuance of the longest peace that europe has had 
in its history 
q mr president youre a great student of the american 
electorate have you concluded that the american public is more 
willing to consider and accept new taxes to deal with the deficit 
bush not particularly if you say to a guy do you want to 
pay more taxes i havent found anybody that would say that but 
i think if we do our job properly and they understand the magnitude 
of the problem at hand in terms of this deficit and then we make a 
proposal that is fair on the revenue side on the spending side 
and then on the reform side so that we dont get in this mess again 
and im going to restrain myself from putting the blame on 
congress because its hard to constrain spending so we need some 
reform then i think if they see all three of these things and they 
see its fair that people will support this 
q would you under any circumstances consider increasing income 
tax rates 
bush ive said and told the leaders that im not going to go 
into the details they are not going into the details of what they 
will or wont accept and the only way to accomplish a negotiation 
is to keep faith with that approach and they are doing that 
republicans as well as democrats so im not going to go into the 
details 
q income taxes are on the table too 
bush im not saying whats on or off ive made my statements 
on that and im just going to go forward ive got preferences 
stronglyheld preferences that people are familiar with but im 
not going to reiterate them because more important than my 
posturing or protecting from arrows coming from one direction is 
getting a deal thats fair and good for the american people 
q mr president i wonder if you can try to explain today why 
you made the no new taxes promise in the first place at the 
time the deficit was absolutely horrendous the savings and loan 
situation was absolutely horrendous and most people greeted your 
promise with a fair amount of cynicism saying taxes were 
eventually going to be needed to bring down the deficit can you 
sort of blame people for now 
bush no i dont want to blame anybody 
qim just saying can you blame people for looking back and 
saying well maybe he didnt really mean it the whole time 
bush i can understand people saying that i think its wrong 
but i can understand it im presented with new facts im doing 
like lincoln did think anew and im thinking anew 
ive still got the principles that underlie my political 
philosophy and havent changed my view about whether you know 
taxes but weve got a major problem facing this country and i 
have the responsibility leading the executive branch to get 
things moving to get a solution 
and the budget deficit is bigger far bigger i thought i could 
do a better job on getting spending down and perhaps getting the 
reforms of the budget process that i also talked about so were 
not talking about just in the campaign talking about one aspect 
i was talking about reform i was talking about spending 
constraints and not having everything go exactly my way now weve 
got to address ourselves to a worse problem maureen than any of 
us visualized back then 
q r president throughout the 88 campaign 
bush ill come back 
q you kept saying and this was a quote the surest way to 
kill economic growth in this country is to raise taxes now 
youre telling us that the reason youre thinking anew about 
raising taxes is to make sure that you sustain economic growth and 
yet you also told us that youre not changing your views about 
taxes exactly what are your views about taxes and what are 
bush wait till you see the agreement that comes out that will 
be my views as to what has to happen hopefully within a month 
of 1990 that will be my views faced with a problem very different 
than the problem facing the presidency in the end of 1988 
q well do you believe that taxes kill economic growth or do 
you believe that higher taxes

president vaclav havel today 
proposed deep cuts in the nations army and urged the first freely 
elected parliament in four decades to help create a modern 
democratic state 
the disintegration of totalitarian systems in our part of 
europe allows dramatic reductions in our army shortening of 
mandatory military service finally abolishing it altogether and 
adoption of the principle of a small but highquality professional 
army havel said 
he said those reforms would occur in such a short time that 
all those who know about these things will be amazed however he 
gave no time frame 
havel addressed the two chambers of parliament six months to the 
day after being inaugurated as president following the peaceful 
revolution in november that overthrew communist rule 
we want to build a modern democratic state havel said in a 
90minute speech in the realm of freedom of speech association 
and assembly room must soon be created for real political 
pluralism 
before speaking havel swore in the new 16member cabinet of 
prime minister marian calfa for the second time in two days in 
response to charges by some deputies that the initial ceremony late 
wednesday was unconstitutional 
according to the statute the government can only be sworn in 
after the first session of parliament has ended extensive 
procedural debate wednesday delayed proceedings until late in the 
evening government members slipped out of parliament for the brief 
swearingin ceremony 
the regional government of the czech republic was also appointed 
today the slovak government was announced wednesday 
calfa had been scheduled to deliver his governments program to 
parliament today but he asked for time until tuesday to finish 
preparation of the document expected to outline an ambitious 
program of economic reform 
the 300member national parliament chosen in the first free 
balloting since 1946 is to elect a new president wednesday havel 
told the state ctk news agency today he would accept the candidacy 
when he is sure parliament accepts the government and its program 
and considers him most suitable 
havel termed the planned economic reform expected to be a 
testing ground of the new governments competence fundamental 
he dubbed the interim cabinet the government of national 
understanding and made clear he expects calfas new cabinet to 
have different priorities referring to it as the government of 
national sacrifice 
the introduction of a market economy is a process which has no 
historical precedent something that has not been fully 
accomplished in any country so far havel said 
other east european countries have embarked on market reforms 
but none has yet developed a model for economic transition 
havel also emphasized the importance of developing education 
culture and spiritual values in a country where these areas were 
suppressed or bent to suit the precepts of totalitarian rule

washington higher taxes 
bush i think taxes wrongly applied can kill economic growth 
and yes i do think that so i think weve got to be very careful 
as to how we get this formula to see that we dont kill off 
economic growth youve got to look at the overall gross national 
product when you talk about that too 
q mr president why didnt you say that during the campaign 
then 
bush well i dont think anybody did such a good penetrating 
job of questioning and because the problem is different the 
problem is quite different owen today than it was then 
q some members of congress and some members of your own staff 
are saying that your three able negotiators as you just described 
them have signaled one important possible deal and that is if you 
if the democrats will give you your capital gains tax cut youre 
prepared to go along with eliminating the bubble on the high end of 
the tax rate scale is that a fair 
bush were going to leave all no its not a fair and im 
not sure your dope is correct either but the i just dont want 
to violate this concept of confidentiality while were in the 
negotiating stage and so i cant respond to it but i wouldnt put 
too much trust in that one 
q mr president if your statement here this morning represents 
your latest thinking why is it that a whole block of conservative 
republicans have already disavowed your position considering it a 
tacit request that you know taxes will be increased 
bush well for the same reason that that that same response 
occurred in 1982 john and we have people who feel very strongly 
on this question and im one of them but ive got to make the 
case for the broader addressing ourselves at this problem here 
but i can understand that 
q it doesnt give you any pause that this fall youre going to 
be out campaigning for republican candidates who disagree with you 
on taxes 
bush no 
q abortion and perhaps other issues 
bush no weve already had weve always had differences with 
me on all those issues one way or another one side or another 
but we also have a matrix of a party that is opposed to 
taxandspend who wants to constrain spending and who wants 
reform and i still feel a fundamental part of that even though 
were talking now about an agreement that will hopefully cover all 
three aspects of that if it if it doesnt there wont be an 
agreement i guess 
q mr president secretary uh president 
bush you have a message for me this is going to work out 
dont worry about it 
q yesterday the secretary of state mr baker seemed to duck 
questions that encompassed two of your dilemmas one is the specter 
of taxes but the other is pressure from the allies which youll 
see in nato and then again in houston to help the soviet union to 
give them some actually more than technical aid have you changed 
your thinking are you moving towards some sort of agreement with 
the allies 
bush we have some differences in the alliance on this question 
youre talking about on just strictly the aid to the soviet 
union ive tried to be very frank and upfront not only with the 
allies but with the soviets on the difficulties we have at this 
juncture because there has got to be economic reform there market 
reform and all kinds of changes that i believe gorbachev wants to 
see take place but they have to be in place for the united states 
to go forward 
then we have a political agenda that weve tried to be very 
frank about secretary baker has presented it in considerable 
detail to mr shevardnadze and i had a chance to touch on it with 
president gorbachev 
and you see it is hard for the american people to say why 
put xbillions of dollars of money into the soviet economy when 
its not reformed when theyre spending 18 percent of their gross 
national product on military and when theyre spending an 
estimated 5 billion in cuba we have some of our allies might 
not be as concerned about that last point as we are im very 
concerned about it 
so we want to try to be of assistance in reform we can do a 
lot in terms of helping institutionally the ebrd in which we are 
a partner a participant now has in place some a facility for 
future lending but i dont want to misrepresent this to our 
allies nor to the soviets and thats why i say weve got 
difficulties with this that perhaps transcend the difficulties that 
others have 
q you will not oppose the allies giving direct aid though 
bush well i want to talk to them about it but i dont think 
we should we should tell mr kohl what his lending policy or 
finance policy should be its understanding hes a neighbor 
theyve got quite different problems with the soviet union than we 
do but normally its best to have the alliance act in concert and 
i expect well be talking about this not only at houston but 
perhaps at the summit at nato 
q mr president do your believe that we reporters are being 
somewhat naive when we suggest in our stories that 
bush yeah because i didnt recognize you i recognized him 
bush ill come back to it frank 
q okay thank you 
bush go ahead 
q oh okay a senior economic advisor in the last 
administration was fond of telling us that economic expansions 
dont die bad policies kill them now that youre admitting that 
the economy is growing sluggish enough that tax revenue increases 
are needed what policies went wrong why do we need this budget 
agreement so badly now

five prisoners hijacked a backhoe in an attempted 
jailbreak today but were foiled by a guard who blocked their path 
with a truck authorities said 
other guards overpowered the prisoners in handtohand fighting 
that left at least four officers injured they said 
the incident at wandsworth prison in south london happened 
when the five prisoners grabbed an officer leading a work force 
through the exercise yard stole his keys and got into a sealed 
area near the perimeter wall according to terry mclaren secretary 
of the guards trade union the prison officers association 
the driver of the backhoe or mechanized digger was forced out 
of his cab the inmates got the backhoe moving apparently hoping 
to break through the wall but a guard jumped into a dump truck and 
blocked their path mclaren said 
when the alarm was sounded some of the 150 other inmates in the 
yard formed a protective semicircle around the wouldbe escapees 
one of the guards who moved in to seize the offenders had his 
arm broken and another was hit on the head with a bottle mclaren 
said both were hospitalized he said 
order was restored after 20 minutes he said adding that the 
escape appeared to have been planned because the inmates all 
maximumsecurity prisoners jailed for armed robbery had hoods and 
masks 
mclaren said seven officers were injured prison governor graham 
clarke said four officers and the digger operator a noninmate 
were injured 
wandsworth a victorian prison with 1389 inmates is famous for 
its tough regime last year it was criticized in an official report 
for failing to meet basic standards of humanity and decency 
judge stephen tumim the chief inspector of prisoners wrote 
that twothirds of the inmates have no work and many are locked in 
cells for 23 hours a day and allowed to shower twice a month at 
most 
inmates wait up to nine weeks to visit the library the central 
bath house is a ghastly place with an atmosphere of an earlier 
century and the kitchens show evidence of mice and cockroaches 
tumim wrote 
mclaren warned of possible trouble during the weekend when only 
95 officers would be on duty half the normal number he said 
todays incident was the third in 10 days involving assaults on 
staff 
in one incident two prisoners tied up a catering manager took 
his keys and locked him in a refrigerated room but were stopped 
just before they got away he said 
last weekend inmates failed in a bid to grab a guards keys 
mclaren said

environmental officials worked behind closed doors 
today to reach a compromise on an agreement to ban chemicals that 
destroy the earths fragile ozone shield 
a major issue is a proposal that would ban a broad range of 
chemicals and establish a global environmental fund to help 
developing nations switch to technology that would protect the 
environment 
when the meeting opened june 19 there appeared to be broad 
consensus on many recommended changes to the montreal protocol of 
1987 
the international treaty controls chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
and other ozonedepleting chemicals used in electronics foam 
blowing fire extinguishers aerosols and refrigeration 
scientific evidence has left little doubt that the ozone layer 
which shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays is eroding 
virtually all of the nearly 100 countries at the meeting recognize 
that the problem is global and lifethreatening 
prospects for agreement seemed good but coming negotiations on 
global warming will be more complex and the current conference was 
viewed as a dress rehearsal 
delegates said that in working sessions countries often 
appeared more concerned about defending their own interests and 
that a conflict was emerging between developed nations of the 
northern hemisphere and poorer southern countries 
there was definitely more northsouth rhetoric here than in 
montreal said richard benedick who headed the us delegation 
at the montreal conference and is in london as an observer 
participants from china a major cfc consumer said it would 
recommend that beijing sign the treaty but india issued an 
ultimatum saying it would sign only if developed nations 
guaranteed to make alternative technology available 
maneka gandhi indias environment minister said the new global 
ozone fund predicted to be worth at least 160 million was not 
enough 
money is irrelevant if we dont have access to knowledge 
survival is about the spread of knowledge she told western 
reporters we did not destroy the ozone layer you have done that 
already dont ask us to pay the price 
the montreal protocol signed by 56 nations called for halving 
the use of eight chemicals including cfcs by 1996 
participants at the current conference were expected to agree to 
a ban on other chemicals including halons and carbon 
tetrachloride both used in firefighting by the year 2000 when 
cfcs are to be phased out entirely 
the united states and environmentalists were united in their 
wish to add to the protocol the new chemical substitutes being 
developed to replace cfcs these chemicals called hcfcs also 
destroy ozone although at a much slower rate 
the european community led by britain france and spain are 
all heavily involved in hcfc production and opposed adding them to 
the treaty 
conference sources said agreement had been reached to mention 
the cfc alternatives in a nonbinding resolution 
still this will be an extraordinary achievement said 
benedick a senior fellow of the conservation foundation and world 
wildlife fund on assignment for the state department 
the environmental fund is a tremendous breakthrough we know 
ultraviolet radiation will kill millions and millions of people 
so progress toward saving the ozone shield is not a trivial 
achievement

this proof 
bush yeah i think weve got slower economic growth than had 
been anticipated and thus fewer revenues thus a bigger deficit 
we have a law requiring us to get the deficit down to certain 
levels and so youve got a combination the discipline that 
grammrudmanhollings causes and economic growth not being as 
robust as we predicted and that is why weve got to do something 
right now 
q mr president in your research of whats happened to others 
have you concluded that were naive to suggest that the public 
takes campaign promises seriously 
bush no i think people are people are smarter than a lot of 
us think they are including me and i think theyre fair and i go 
back to the experiences of previous people that have been in this 
office who say one thing in a campaign come in and keep their 
keep that pledge if youre talking about taxes for quite a while 
and then see that theres an enormous problem facing the nation 
that requires a bipartisan answer and if i could if i had 
control of this congress both houses we might not even be talking 
about this today but theres a different feeling here and ive 
got to see the country go forward and ive got to take the heat 
that comes from certain quarters political and other and im 
prepared to do that because i think im on the right track and i 
think in the final analysis the american people will understand 
that 
q and you think the public understands this and takes this into 
account when they hear campaign pledges 
bush well ive seen ive seen polling figures that indicate 
that but i dont want to i dont want to suggest that all 
politicians are cynical certainly when i was making making 
comments of that nature i was convinced that i could stay the 
course and we did for a long time and we may now but lets see 
where we go on this negotiation because more important than how 
people look at what ive said is what happens to the economy what 
happens to jobs what happens to economic growth so when you 
when you make a change that people see as a dramatic shift youve 
got to batten down the hatches and take the heat 
but i really im not trying to misrepresent my position i 
feel comfortable about that because ive gone back and done a 
little research and seen these firestorms come and go people who 
feel just as strongly on one side or another of an issue as i do 
and havent gotten their way exactly thats the american system 
and ive got to work with it congress can they can go out 
everybody up there can go out and take a position but its only 
the president that has the responsbility for you know for the 
whole executive branch approach to it 
q mr president how do you explain to the country why youre 
treating this as essentially a washington insiders game right now 
why not explain to the public what your list of priorities are 
within the spending and tax issues are there no longer any lines 
to be drawn in the sand based on your convictions on these areas 
bush yeah and they will be drawn in the negotiations but then 
id im going to do exactly what youre talking about im going 
to tell the american people why this bipartisan agreement which 
im still hopeful well get is essential to the national interest

officials have ordered nine utahbased 
wilderness therapy programs to bring their 400 young clients out of 
the desert heat in the wake of the death of a florida girl the 
second death in six weeks 
the body of the 16yearold girl was taken to the utah medical 
examiners office for autopsy after she collapsed wednesday while 
hiking on the kaiparowits plateau a desert bluff about 300 miles 
south of salt lake city 
the medical examiners office was checking on the girls medical 
history and the autopsy report was not expected to be made public 
for a day or two 
the girl christen chase of ponte vedra beach fla died while 
participating in the in the controversial challenger wilderness 
program said kane county sheriff maxwell jackson 
challenger founder and director stephen cartisano a former army 
ranger said the girl had been in the program only four days 
he said she was nearing the end of a 4 mile hike when she 
became dizzy and collapsed unconscious he said that even though a 
challengerowned helicopter was on the site within half an hour 
she never regained consciousness 
charles brofman the programs attorney said miss chase was 
absolutely not hiking in the heat of the day he said counselors 
watch weather reports and hike around the high temperatures 
miss chase is the second participant in a utah wilderness 
program to die in may 15yearold michelle sutton of pleasanton 
calif collapsed and died while hiking in northern arizona with 14 
other patients in the summit quest program based in st george 
utah an autopsy showed she died of dehydration due to exposure 
said mojave county ariz sheriffs spokeswoman jewell potter 
temperatures in utahs southern desert have peaked near 110 
degrees for the past week although it has not been determined 
whether the heat played a role in the most recent death 
utah department of social services spokeswoman terry twitchell 
said directors of the nine utah wilderness experience groups will 
be called to a meeting to try and establish stringent 
guidelines on their activities 
meantime she said the departments division of licensing has 
ordered that all of the groups bring their charges into base camps 
with food water and supervision 
it would seem to me common sense would tell you that when the 
heat gets this high you have to be careful about hiking she 
said thats why we took immediate action until we can determine 
what exactly happened 
twitchell said utah has been flooded with the wilderness 
groups which promise to tame unruly teenagers by teaching them 
survival skills and responsibility for inappropriate behavior 
in most cases the youngsters are taken into the desert with 
minimal equipment such as clothes and a sleeping bag and are 
forced to forage for their survival under the supervision of 
counselors 
part of the reason is because we have a lot of wilderness 
said twitchell another reason is you can make a lot of money at 
them theres not a lot of overhead 
challenger for instance charges 15900 for a 63day 
experience

washington national interest 
q the republicans have gotten a lot of mileage in the last 
several elections out of what the democrats think has been 
shameless demagoguery on the tax issue by assuming that you get 
this bipartisan agreement havent you basically undercut that 
argument for your party hasnt your party now lost that issue 
bush some will say so but not if i go out and do my part and if 
i remind them of history take a good look at the reaction in 1982 
and it didnt have that kind of an adverse effect 
q mr president 
bush sarah sarah you thought id never 
q thank you herethink you can solve your 
problem research shows youre going to nato and youre going to 
try to reform it but research shows that you can save 150 billion 
to 160 billios a way sir i n by cutting out the support that we give 
to other 
foreign countries by preparing for their defense of europe now 
why in the name of god dont you cut down the spending that 
youre putting on nato when were really paying this for other 
countries that are going to a summit with you 
bush because i believe that a strong nato is in the national 
security interests of the united states i think it is in our 
interest that europe has kept the peace for 40some years s got to go 
forward and i convinced it im convinced that it if he has 
done something wrong the system will so state and if it hasnt i 
hope its fair enough to say hey the boy did nothing wrong 
q have you discussed this issue with him 
bush only in that broad parental way but making clear and he 
would be the last to ask me in any way to get involved in any side 
or the other i do think that those who allege misconduct ought to 
speak up and say what it is 
but its not been easy for him hes probably the most sensitive 
of our four boys maybe second most sensitive i cant quantify 
this for you with all four of them but hes a good kid and its 
not easy hes held his head up he too has taken a few shots on 
this but hes had some good defenders from both sides of the 
aisle and the system is going to work whether its the 
presidents son or somebody else and to suggest that it doesnt 
undermines the basic integrity of the american process the 
american system but its not easy for him but hell do okay 
thank you 
q mr president 
bush the last one sandy last one and then ive 
got to go 
q mr president have you seen the marion barry tape and 
whats your reaction 
bush i thought id get asked that and i am simply not going to 
get into that matter it is not appropriate its a matter for you 
know in the courts and please forgive me for not commenting on 
that one 
thank you all very much

east germanys top prosecutor has opened a 
murder probe against former communist leader erich honecker 
stemming from the deaths of people who tried to flee the country 
the nations news agency said today 
honecker is believed to be the first hardline communist leader 
ousted in the prodemocracy revolutions that swept eastern europe 
to be targeted in a murder investigation romanias former leader 
nicolae ceausescu was executed on christmas day after a quickly 
arranged trial on genocide charges 
honecker could receive a life prison term if he is formally 
charged and convicted of murder charges 
whether honecker is ever brought to trial however is unclear 
because of his failing health he has been suffering from kidney 
cancer and other problems and is in a hospital in the east german 
town of beelitz 
acting chief prosecutor guenter seidel also is investigating 
soldiers suspected of having killed wouldbe escapees according to 
the news agency adn 
more than 200 east germans were shot to death or killed by land 
mines as they tried to escape from east germany and east berlin 
under more than 40 years of communist rule 
bringing those responsible to justice has been one of the most 
bitterly debated issues in east germany today 
the 77yearold honecker whose hardline regime was toppled in 
a peaceful revolution in october already is the target of other 
criminal probes including a west german one for allegedly 
harboring west german terrorists 
meanwhile in czechoslovakia the trial of miroslav stepan the 
former prague communist party boss charged with abuse of power by a 
public official was opened to the public today after four days of 
closeddoor proceedings 
stepan 44 the first communist to be put on trial in 
czechoslvoakia after last years peaceful revolution toppled 
communist rule was accused of instructing former prague police 
chief bohumil carda to use water cannons and tear gas against 
demonstrators in pragues wenceslas square on oct 28 1988 
stepan was also charged with ordering the transport of 195

the fbi frantically tried to keep marion barry 
in a hotel room with exmodel rasheeda moore to avoid the collapse 
of its undercover sting operation against the mayor barrys lawyer 
said today in federal court 
r kenneth mundy zeroed in on the fbi videotape which was played 
thursday at barrys cocaine and perjury trial showing the mayor 
smoking crack cocaine jan 18 at the vista hotel 
on the tape when barry announces that he was preparing to leave 
moores hotel room an female fbi undercover agent telephones moore 
you told the agent you were coming downstairs and the agent 
said no no dont suggested mundy 
thats correct said moore 
the plan was to keep mr barry in the hotel room said mundy 
that is correct said moore 
the plan was not to let him get down to the lobby said 
mundy moore agreed 
after the agents call the undercover agent known as wanda 
moore delivered crack to the room and barry smoked it wanda was 
posing as a friend of moores 
mundy suggested moores testimony against barry has been bought 
and paid for by the fbi mundy brought out that even the clothes on 
her back used in the sting operation were purchased by the 
government 
as a model you know what a wardrobe is dont you inquired 
mundy 
clothes for the operation were provided by the fbi admitted 
moore 
mundy also focused on moores efforts to coax a reluctant barry 
up to her hotel room to begin the sting 
who gave you instructions that you had to get mr barry into 
the hotel room mundy demanded to know 
i was told by the fbi said moore 
but in testimony earlier to a grand jury she said the opposite 
mundy said 
the fbi told you not to persuade mr barry to come up to the 
hotel room said mundy referring to her earlier grand jury 
testimony 
thats correct i was told not to be persuasive admitted 
moore such instructions would indicate the fbi was being careful 
to avoid accusations that it was entrapping the mayor 
when mundy suggested she was either lying now or had lied to the 
grand jury she said she was confused by his questions 
assistant us attorney judith retchin objected several times to 
mundys questioning saying the defense attorney was interrupting 
the witness before she could answer us district court judge 
thomas penfield jackson overruled the objections 
barrys lawyer depicted moore as a downonherluck exmodel who 
had lied about her own drug use as recently as january she had 
been introduced to freebasing crack cocaine in the summer of 1987 
she told the grand jury 
you didnt want the grand jury to know that you had been 
freebasing crack cocaine for 14 years mundy told her 
that was not the case mr mundy replied moore she 
admitted she had been freebasing for that long but said that for a 
period leading up to the summer of 1987 she had not done it 
it was inaccurate she said of her grand jury testimony but 
i was not choosing to be dishonest 
in the videotape played thursday in court the female fbi agent 
posing as moores friend brings a bag of crack cocaine to the hotel 
room 
barry told moore i dont smoke no more honey and the 
undercover agent left the room but barry told moore to call her 
back 
go get some go get it the mayor told moore and the deal 
was consummated with barry paying for the drugs 
barry and moore each wanted the other to be the first to smoke 
the crack 
i thought you bought this because you wanted to take a hit 
moore told barry on the videotape 
aw naw you do it the mayor replied 
if you dont do it im not going to do it said the mayor 
who finally walked over to a dresser and inhaled twice deeply from 
an fbisupplied crack pipe 
moments later as barry and moore prepared to go downstairs fbi 
agents burst into the room and arrested the mayor 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor 
cocainepossession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy 
charge and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his 
alleged drug use one possession charge stems from the night of his 
arrest on jan 18 
barry acknowledged a month ago that he smoked crack that night 
and said federal prosecutors were trying to kill him by providing a 
potentially lethal dose of the drug

an error in the grinding and polishing of the 
main mirrors aboard the hubble space telescope has been pinpointed 
as the cause of a focus flaw that crippled the 15 billion 
orbiting observatory 
an official of hughes danbury optical co which manufactured 
the mirrors said thursday night that experiments with signals from 
the hubble have confirmed that a mistake was made in the tedious 
threeyear process of making the primary and secondary hubble 
mirrors 
with fairly high certainty we have concluded that the 
shape of one of the mirrors is not correct said terence facey a 
hughes danbury engineer who helped nasa isolate the source of the 
hubble focusing problem 
he said it was not known which mirror is flawed but that may be 
discovered by searching the connecticut companys records of tests 
conducted during the months of grinding and polishing required to 
turn footthick spherical glass blanks into the telescope mirrors 
those records and equipment used in making the mirrors have been 
impounded by nasa as the first step in an investigation of what 
went wrong with the expensive satellite the agencys chief 
scientist lennard fisk told a senate committee today 
but fisk said he was somewhat concerned that we are going to 
try and reconstruct an event that took place a decade ago and he 
sought to put the best face on the problem telling sen al gore 
dtenn that much excellent scientific work will be unaffected 
we will adjust the observing program to emphasize the things 
that hubble does well today such as ultraviolet imagery fisk 
said 
two senators who oversee the space program meanwhile reacted 
angrily to news of the hubble focusing flaw and ordered hearings on 
the mistake 
im very outraged at what has happened to hubble said sen 
barbara mikulski dmd they have had 10 years to put this 
together and spent 28 billion to be able to get it right 
now we find that the hubble telescope has a cataract she 
said 
the national aeronautics and space administration has said the 
telescope cost 15 billion plus 600 million for operations and 
maintenance 
sen albert gore dtenn chairman of the senate subcommittee 
on science technology and space called a hearing on the hubble 
problem for today with nasas chief scientist lennard fisk as 
the lead witness 
mikulski said she and rep bob traxler dmich also plan an 
investigation 
nasa engineers discovered the focusing flaw in hubble after they 
were unable to coax the telescope into capturing crisp clean 
photos of distant stars 
facey said he assisted the space agency in the tests and helped 
to confirm that the problem was in one of the two mirrors it was a 
tough job he said in a telephone interview its always 
difficult to conclude that youve made a mistake 
meanwhile the new york times reported in todays editions that 
nasa decided against using topsecret groundbased military 
testing equipment that likely would have detected the problem 
before the hubble was launched the times quoted a scientist 
involved in the agencys deliberations who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
facey said that although the main hubble mirror can be adjusted 
slightly from the ground by moving actuators that cause the glass 
to flex the system will not correct the focus enough to eliminate 
the problem he said only about 10 percent of the focus error could 
be corrected 
nasa has started a formal investigation of the hubble problem 
lew allen head of the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
calif was named chairman of an engineer review committee that 
space agency officials said will include outside experts 
meanwhile astronomers are scrambling to find ways to salvage 
some use from the hubble despite the loss of precise focus 
ed weiler a nasa scientist said three of the five instruments 
on board will be able to get 50 to 75 percent of their planned 
scientific studies 
two of the instruments are spectrometers which can measure the 
temperature composition and movement of stars another instrument 
a photometer will be able to measure stellar brightness and to 
look for black holes 
most seriously hurt by the loss of focus are two cameras 
designed to capture visual images of distant stars galaxies and 
other objects 
the 40 million widefield planetary camera will be of only 
small use without a precise focus and weiler called it a 
significant loss 
a replacement widefield camera is scheduled to be installed in 
hubble in june 1993 weiler said a new optical lens which will 
correct the focus flaw from the mirror will allow the new camera 
to take sharp pictures 
the fifth hubble instrument a faint object camera that can 
gather images in invisible ultraviolet light will be able to do 
about 50 percent of its planned studies he said 
weiler said that though the focus flaw causes big problems for 
hubble the error actually is minute he said the telescope misses 
precise focus by a distance of only 4 percent of the diameter of a 
human hair

the communist partycentral committee today cleared 
the way for an important party congress on monday the tass news 
agency indicated tass also warned of disaster if the party 
ousts mikhail s gorbachev as its leader or derails his reforms 
the policymaking central committee tentatively approved a 
report president gorbachev will deliver at the 28th congress of the 
soviet communist party 
however the 249member committee ordered the politburo to 
rework it taking into account the discussion that took place 
during a fivehour closeddoor meeting in the kremlin said 
alexander kapto head of the central committee ideological 
department 
boris n yeltsin the president of the russian republic and 
some fellow reformers had urged the committee to postpone mondays 
party congress until autumn to stabilize the political 
situation 
but other reformers as well as hardline communist foes of 
gorbachev opposed a delay 
the central committee ended its meeting today without discussing 
the proposals to delay the congress meaning it will proceed as 
scheduled on monday tass reported that the meeting will open 
monday and will last for about 10 days 
reformers say gorbachevs foes could dominate the gathering 
undermine him as he tries to pull the country out of a deep 
economic and political crisis and force progressives to quit the 
party 
tass warned today in a sharply worded commentary that ousting 
gorbachev as head of the communist party or derailing his reforms 
could spell disaster 
at the congress gorbachev is expected to come under renewed 
pressure from hardliners who say he should not hold both the post 
of party chief and the soviet presidency 
tass commentator andrei orlov was highly critical of those 
seeking to unseat gorbachev as party head or undermine his reform 
efforts 
there is an obvious discrepancy between the correct decisions 
and open resistance to reforms on the part of some party 
functionaries who are increasingly aware of the real challenge to 
their once undisputed power he wrote 
a lapse or a deliberate rejection of perestroika is fraught 
with disaster and not for the party alone he said 
a day earlier communist reformers struggled to find common 
ground to unite them against a resurgent traditionalist wing that 
is sharply critical of gorbachevs economic and political changes 
radicals of the democratic platform faction said thursday they 
expected to walk away from the partys congress of 4700 delegates 
in reality despite the many statements of leaders the 
communist party has shown it is simply incapable of reforming 
itself said vladimir lysenko a leader of the democratic 
platform 
lysenko told reporters democratic platforms 100 delegates will 
fight for its program but if it proves impossible there will be 
a statement that either the communist party has split or a new 
party is starting 
leaders say a poll of party members indicates about 40 percent 
identify themselves as supporters of democratic platform but they 
acknowledge many people support the faction not because of its 
program but simply because it represents a formal challenge to the 
party bureaucracy 
the proposed split in the communist party would be the first 
since 1922 and gorbachev has warned it would divide and weaken the 
forces struggling for reform 
gorbachev speaking last week to a congress of communists from 
the russian republic warned a split in the party would be a 
gift to opponents of reform 
in a nationally televised debate fyodor burlatsky a respected 
lawyer and editor of the literaturnaya gazeta newspaper appealed 
for unity between radical reformers or leftists and moderates 
led by gorbachev 
there are no fundamental differences between the center and 
the left he said the center is no longer afraid of a 
regulated market economy a multiparty system a new treaty between 
the republics 
despite arguments that gorbachev is not moving fast enough with 
economic reforms and restructuring of the political system or that 
he is moving closer to the traditionalists burlatsky said 
decisions made in recent months prove the soviet leader is pushing 
hard for reform 
however new party documents fall far short of democratic 
platforms demands that the party give up its claim to try to 
organize soviet society and party cells at workplaces in the 
army the police and the kgb 
if the right wing at the communist party congress presses for 
the election of their man as general secretary then the center and 
the left should counter by supporting gorbachev burlatsky said 
instead of reformers like democratic platform members splitting 
off it could be the traditional hardliners or right wing who 
leave the party he said 
burlatsky is known as an influential and loyal backer of 
gorbachev his remarks could signal a trend among influential 
moderates to seek common ground with radicals to counter the 
traditional sovietstyle communists who dominated a gathering of 
party members from the huge russian republic last week

an unidentified youth shot and killed a 
moslem official and suspected moslem separatists killed two hindu 
women in kashmir state today witnesses and officials said 
additional deputy commissioner abdul aziz khan a senior civil 
administrator was shot in the abdomen as he walked out of his home 
in a srinagar suburb said a neighbor who witnessed the attack 
the youth who fired only one shot with a revolver escaped down 
a side street after khan fell to the ground said the neighbor 
mala begum 
mrs begum said she summoned help and took khan to a hospital 
where he died about four hours later 
in neighboring pulwama district suspected moslem militants shot 
and killed two women said state government officials who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules they identified the women as 
rupavati and her daughterinlaw babli only their first names 
were available 
it was not immediately clear why the women were killed both 
were hindus 
moslem militants usually attack security forces but are 
increasingly turning their guns on hindus in their campaign for 
secession of the kashmir valley from hindudominated india 
sixtyfour percent of jammukashmir states 6 million people are 
moslem making it the only state in india with a moslem majority 
nationwide moslems account for 12 percent of indias 880 
million people and hindus comprise 82 percent 
at least 655 people have been killed in kashmir since jan 20 
when the government began a crackdown on the separatist movement 
most of the victims have been militants or their supporters shot 
while defying curfew restrictions 
the separatism movement has been simmering since 1947 but flared 
last winter with a wave of bombings and assassinations 
kashmir was a princely state that opted for merger with india 
when the britishruled indian subcontinent was divided into india 
and pakistan 
kashmiri separatists earlier wanted union with pakistan an 
islamic country but have lately demanded independence and the 
status of a neutral country

a former police chief who once said he 
was possessed by cocaine was sentenced to 10 years in prison 
for stealing the drug from an evidence room 
richard j sproules a 22year police veteran is believed to be 
the highest ranking massachusetts police officer to be charged with 
drug offenses 
plymouth superior court judge suzanne v delvecchio sentenced 
sproules on thursday to two concurrent seven to 10year state 
prison sentences for the cocaine offense and for embezzling city 
funds 
delvecchio also sentenced sproules 46 to concurrent sentences 
of three to five years on two counts of intimidation of a witness 
and on one count of attempting to get another person to commit 
perjury 
in a plea for leniency sproules told the judge my actions 
are inexcusable for all the youngsters who looked up to me im 
ashamed 
you look at me a ruined and destroyed man but theres no one 
to blame but me he said as his voice shook with emotion 
a grand jury indicted sproules last year on charges of larceny 
of cocaine attempting to get another person to commit perjury 
obstruction of justice larceny of more than 250 and two counts of 
intimidation of a witness 
the same grand jury indicted him on a charge of embezzlement 
last march 
police arrested sproules who was once a leader in the fight 
against drugs in brockton in his office oct 24after his arrest 
he admitted to a fiveyear cocaine addiction that he said 
possessed me 
sproules arrest shocked this city of 95000 people located 
about 23 miles south of boston he was proclaimed the citys best 
hope in the fight against drugs when he was appointed police chief 
in 1987 
prosecutor john kivlan said the perjury charge arose from an 
incident in which sproules tried to persuade one of his detectives 
to testify that a cocaine package sproules had partially used and 
resealed was in the same state as it had been when it was seized 
from a suspect 
sproules was charged with intimidation of a witness after trying 
to get two detectives not to testify against him and telling them 
evidence from the case was not available kivlan said 
prosecutors said in court thursday that 75000 in city funds 
controlled by sproules are still unaccounted for but sproules 
attorney said all but a small amount of the money was accounted for

the global total to 266098 since the start of recordkeeping in 
1981 
in its monthly update published friday who said new reports 
from north and south america were largely responsible for the 
increase 
the un agency said the united states registered 1453 new 
cases in june this raised the official number of us victims to 
133889 since reporting began in 1981 brazil was the secondworst 
affected country in the americas with 11070 cases reported who 
said 
worldwide uganda has the secondhighest aids toll behind the 
united states by the end of last year it reported 12444 aids 
victims followed by neighboring zaire with 11732 
at the end of may the global total of registered aids cases 
stood at 263051 but who officials estimated the real figure is 
closer to 700000 
the who reports cover only victims of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and not people infected with the virus that causes the

americas space shuttle fleet has been 
grounded until engineers can correct a hydrogen leak that has been 
found on a second spacecraft officials said today 
william lenoir nasas space flight chief said that the agency 
has no choice but to stop space shuttle launches and allow 
engineers to study the leak problem and fix it 
we cant fly until we can get hydrogen in the tank and were 
having a problem with that right now said lenoir at a news 
conference from the kennedy space center in florida 
the announcement came after engineers conducted a leak check on 
space shuttle atlantis which is on the launch pad awaiting a 
planned midjuly launch 
the test involving pumping up to 200000 gallons of liquid 
hydrogen into atlantis giant external tank was intended to 
establish confidence in the hardware nasa spokeswoman lisa 
malone said 
malone said a concentration of hydrogen was found near a 
fourinch disconnect valve in the area of a 17inchdiameter valve 
the same that appeared responsible for the leak that grounded 
columbia 
the leak was detected by one of two sensors mounted between the 
orbiter and the tank about 18 minutes after the test began an 
additional 21 sensors had been installed in the orbiters aft 
compartment to sniff for leaks 
before the leak was discovered nasa had hoped to launch 
atlantis on a secret military mission in midjuly 
the leak check was ordered as a precaution after a similar 
hydrogen leak stopped the countdown for the shuttle columbia six 
hours before its intended launch may 30 columbia is now grounded 
until at least midaugust 
the leak was spotted moments after the slow filling of the tank 
was switched to fast pumping at precisely the point in the tanking 
where columbias leak was discovered 
nasa officials including launch director bob sieck and kennedy 
space center director forrest mccartney were monitoring the test 
from the firing room 
the tank only about 5 percent full at the time the leak was 
sensed was to be filled further in an effort to isolate the leak 
malone said

the lithuanian parliament agreed today 
to put a 100day freeze on its declaration of independence in 
return for an end to the kremlins economic blockade and the start 
of negotiations on secession 
the move could end the breakaway baltic republics 3monthold 
standoff with moscow over its drive toward independence 
if the agreement is approved by moscow it would resolve one of 
the most contentious regional disputes facing president mikhail s 
gorbachev as he prepares for a key national communist party 
congress monday 
the resolution accepting a proposed compromise was approved by a 
vote of 69to35 with two abstentions 
it called for the 100day moratorium to begin simultaneously 
with the start of negotiations with the soviet government 
the deal was worked out at two meetings between president 
mikhail s gorbachev and lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
this week according to lithuanian officials 
but there was no immediate comment from soviet authorities on 
whether the lithuanian vote would be sufficient to end the embargo 
and start talks 
it also was not clear when those negotiations could begin 
because gorbachev was expected to be tied up with the national 
party congress where his reform effort is expected to be attacked 
by hardliners 
we had hoped that it would end today prime minister 
kazmiera prunskiene who also had backed the compromise said of 
the embargo 
the move by the parliament came hours after landsbergis reversed 
his position and endorsed the compromise plan on the march 11 
declaration 
two years ago we chose the peaceful route to independence 
the route of negotiations landsbergis told the republics 
lawmakers now the condition for negotiations is a moratorium 
the lithuanian president said he changed his mind because the 
draft resolution does not support an immediate or unconditional 
moratorium 
it proposes declaring a moratorium in some conditions he 
told reporters after speaking to parliament 
under the plan talks would begin on a date agreed to by both 
sides the moratorium would freeze all the legal actions of the 
independence declaration itself but under the resolution laws 
passed by the lithuanian parliament since the declaration of 
independence will remain in effect including the replacement of 
the soviet constitution with the lithuanian one 
the moratorium could be prolonged or canceled by the lithuanian 
parliament and would be automatically be rescinded if the 
lithuanian parliament for some reason were unable to perform its 
duties 
landsbergis and mrs prunskiene were expected to fly to tallinn 
estonia later today for the opening of a festival they were 
expected to meet the leaders of the other baltic republics estonia 
and latvia to discuss the status of their talks with the kremlin 
outside the lithuanian parliament earlier today protesters 
criticized the compromise 
a moratorium is the death of independence read one sign 
lithuania was an independent country between the world wars but 
was occupied by soviet soldiers in 1940 and absorbed into the 
soviet union 
about 50000 workers have lost their jobs since the kremlin cut 
all oil most natural gas and other raw materials and manufactured 
goods 10 weeks ago 
the blockade is barely visible in vilnius the lithuanian 
capital most workers still are earning vacation pay hot water is 
flowing and there is no need for heat but mrs prunskiene told 
parliament it must accept a deal because the west is demanding a 
compromise and the economic blockade could turn lithuania into a 
disaster area by winter

often lavish to the extreme the japanese wedding 
isnt just ceremony its theater 
enter a prince dressed in black and red silken robes with the 
curved black tailpiece of his royal cap bobbing with every step and 
a mace held straight up before his chest 
a few steps behind a princesstobe her hair coiffed in 
ancient court fashion her kimono a rainbow of nearly a dozen 
layers colored green burgundy maroon and orange 
the stage a quiet mysterious shrine tucked away in a small 
wood behind the moat and high stone walls of the imperial palace 
then there is a cinderella plot line the sipping of sacred rice 
wine and the reading of solemn vows to a sun goddess 
it is the ultimate in japanese nuptials the royal wedding 
on friday the 1 million affair was for prince aya emperor 
akihitos youngest son and his college sweetheart 23yearold 
graduate student kiko kawashima only the second commoner to marry 
into japans imperial family 
while on a smaller scale many wedding customs practiced by the 
average japanese reflect those of the imperial family 
possibly because the wedding was the first for an imperial 
family member since 1984 and the first for a prince of ayas 
status in nearly three decades japans media rushed to chronicle 
it and the trends it spawned 
newspaper readers have been informed of hurried engagements of 
famous entertainers booming sales of pearl necklaces like the one 
princess kiko was wearing and rising prices for stock shares in 
bridal companies 
a rental business even sprang up for the bulky junihitoe 
style kimono that princess kiko wore the traditional japanese 
attire now is reserved mainly for special occasions 
the rental fee for the kimono makeup and wig is 2600 only a 
fraction of the 58000 the average japanese will spend on a 
wedding and honeymoon says the japan institute for social and 
economic affairs 
miss kawashima began friday in a pink dress and hat became 
princess kiko in the multilayered kimono and then greeted her 
imperial inlaws in a white evening dress replete with 
diamondstudded tiara and necklace 
most brides in japan change clothes at least once during their 
reception often beginning with a kimono and switching to a 
cocktail dress the reappearance made as a mist from dry ice 
spreads across the hall adds a theatrical touch 
after the end of world war ii nearly all weddings were 
performed at shrines to the gods of shinto japans indigenous 
religion sakesipping before the shinto gods however ancient it 
may sound was an innovation made for the wedding of ayas 
greatgrandfather in 1900 
shintostyle weddings still are the most popular accounting for 
55 percent to 60 percent of the total says keiko shimizu of the 
private wedding advice center but they may be on the way out 
young women these days prefer church weddings not because of 
any particular religious beliefs but because they want to wear 
wedding dresses ms shimizu said they are used to 
westernstyle clothes and just dont feel comfortable in kimono any 
more

wilson who keeps track of marriage and divorce statistics for the 
government 
june is the most popular month for weddings she explained 
saturdays are the most popular day with the last saturday in june

the fact that next wednesday is the independence day holiday 
adds to the number of marriages this weekend by giving people a 
chance to have a holiday honeymoon she added 
the average bride is expected to be about 245 years old and the 
bridegroom 264 this year wilson said 
and if current statistics hold true about half the couples who 
tie the knot this week will untie it by the turn of the century 
on occasion st valentines day falls on saturday and when that 
happens it usually jumps into first place in marriages that 
happened in 1987 but wont occur again until 1998

yale university will shelve a 
79yearold literary tradition this fall when the yale review falls 
victim to budget concerns 
the magazine the oldest literary quarterly in the country has 
featured works by eugene oneill edith wharton virginia woolf 
wallace stevens and leon trotsky 
author john hersey who taught at yale and whose essay first 
job was published in the review called the decision 
symptomatic of what is happening in publishing where money has 
become more important than words 
yale president benno c schmidt jr announced thursday that the 
review will cease after the issues in progress go to print he 
cited the magazines deficits that the university must absorb its 
limited readership and the absence of any direct tie to yales 
academic programs 
the time has come either to make significant changes in the 
magazine or to discontinue its publication in a dignified way 
schmidt said i have chosen to do the latter 
the review began in 1819 as the christian spectator and became 
the yale review in 1911 it is considered the grandparent of other 
literary journals including the kenyon georgia southern and 
suwannee reviews 
over the years the magazine has showcased a blend of criticism 
essays poetry and fiction by known and emerging writers 
poet john hollander who is the a bartlett giamatti professor 
of comparative literature at yale called the decision deplorable 
i hope that the university can change its mind hollander 
said 
the news is depressing because it seems on the whole part of 
the american problem with illiteracy said robert giroux senior 
editor of farrar straus and giroux publishers in new york it is 
an antiliterate action 
schmidt said he talked with many faculty members and did not 
reach the decision without misgiving but he said he was not 
convinced yale could raise 1 million from donors to endow the 
quarterlys annual costs 
the yale university press publishes the quarterly which has a 
paid circulation of about 4200 
editor penelope laurans said she was saddened by the reviews 
end 
the yale review is a cultural institution which has linked the 
university to a world of art beyond it she said

a judge deferred sentencing for at least a year 
after a teenager pleaded guilty to slashing actress viveca 
lindfors and another victim in january 
peter bedfords guilty plea thursday to one count of 
firstdegree assault would ordinarily mean a mandatory prison term 
of up to 15 years said gerald mckelvey a spokesman for the 
manhattan district attorney 
but acting justice renee white promised the 18yearold brooklyn 
man that if he met conditions set by the court during the year he 
would be allowed to plead guilty to seconddegree assault that 
charge does not mandate prison time

cheek as she was walking with friends the actress also suffered 
scrapes and bruises after she was knocked her down 
minutes earlier mckelvey said bedford had encountered dennis 
beale and slashed him from the right ear down to the chin

anonymous tip 
the judges conditions include bedford getting psychiatric 
treatment remaining employed or in school and not committing any

the city council vote 113 today to censure an 
alderman who ignited a poisoned sausage scare and has threatened 
violence through a black militant group he has started 
the council failed to approve a weaker resolution that would 
have repudiated michael r mcgee but not censure him the motion 
failed 86 on the first vote 
mcgee who earlier this week resigned his council committee 
assignments over the sausage incident left the meeting with 
several members of his black panther militia and refused to speak 
to reporters 
this hearing means nothing to me whatsoever whoever votes for 
this i could care less he said during a speech from the floor 
it just confirms my statements of how racist this city is 
about 15 militia members attended the council meeting holding 
up signs and applauding frequently when mcgee spoke 
the resolution approved by the council also called on mcgee to 
temper his future statements to promote the good of the city 
one of the three council members who opposed the resolution 
alderman john kalwitz said mcgee had been found guilty without due 
process or trial 
the vote to censure was the first of its kind in the council 
city clerk ronald d leonhardt said 
the censure vote was a criticism of the way mcgee handled and an 
anonymous phone call he said he received from a militant 
underground group claiming that products of usingers famous 
sausage inc had been injected with rat poison 
the warning forced uingers a centuryold familyowned 
business to recall 80000 pounds of meat from 150 stores a 
preliminary inspection has found none of the meat was tainted 
usingers and other downtown companies have opposed mcgees 
proposal to rename all of third street for the late civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr segments of the street are already 
named for king 
mayor john o norquist and some city council members said they 
want to punish mcgee for what they say is an unsubstantiated threat 
and malicious prank 
at a news conference norquist called mcgee a demented 
person who fabricated the warning to gain media attention 
its a hoax its phony norquist charged what hes 
really doing is scaring the hell out of people which feeds racism 
and bigotry 
mcgee one of only three blacks on the 16member city council 
earlier this year started a black panther militia group which he 
says will use violent terrorist strikes beginning in 1995 if inner 
city conditions in milwaukee dont improve mcgee has claimed his 
militia already has about 500 members including many young street 
gang members 
censure is a symbolic action with no legal or practical effect 
other than to rebuke a members actions the failed motion to 
repudiate mcgee was similar but used less strong language 
mcgee did not take part in the censure vote of the other two 
blacks on the council one voted against censure and the other was 
not present

former east german leader erich honecker will 
be investigated for murder in the deaths of people who were shot or 
killed by land mines as they tried to escape communist rule the 
state news agency said friday 
acting east german chief prosecutor guenter seidel also is 
investigating individual soldiers suspected of having killed 
wouldbe escapees according to east germanys adn news agency 
more than 200 east germans were shot to death or killed by land 
mines as they tried to escape from east germany and east berlin 
during more than four decades of communist rule bringing those 
responsible to justice has been one of the most bitterly debated 
issues in east germany since the fall revolution toppled the 
communist government 
honecker is believed to be the first communist leader ousted in 
eastern europes prodemocracy movement to be targeted in a murder 
investigation romanias former leader nicolae ceausescu was 
executed on christmas day after a quickly arranged trial on 
genocide charges 
if convicted the 77yearold honecker could receive life in 
prison however it is unclear whether he will ever be brought to 
trial because of his failing health he has been suffering from 
kidney cancer and other problems and is in a hospital in the east 
german town of beelitz 
honecker already is the target of other criminal probes 
including a west german investigation for allegedly harboring west 
german terrorists 
the personal guilt of honecker for the deadly shootings at the 
berlin wall and the germangerman boundary is to be investigated 
said seidels spokesman dieter plath at an east berlin news 
conference carried by adn 
he added that honeckers poor health has made it impossible to 
interrogate him he also said many records of the old east german 
leadership were destroyed by the secret police when it became clear 
the honecker regime was crumbling 
this makes the investigation very difficult plath said it 
also makes it difficult to determine when the investigation might 
be completed he said 
for months there have been growing demands for legal action 
against honecker who was ousted in october 
honecker supervised construction of the berlin wall in 1961 and 
maintained shoottokill orders after taking over as the countrys 
leader in 1971 
however even before honeckers ouster the land mines and 
automatic shooting devices on the germangerman border had been 
removed and honecker claimed the shoottokill orders had been 
lifted 
the chief prosecutor filed a criminal complaint against 
honecker that procedure institutes a criminal investigation that 
could lead to an indictment and trial 
one reason for this complaint at this time is to counter 
speculation about an amnesty for those responsible for the 
shootings plath said 
east germans have been infuriated by a military prosecutors 
decision to rule out courtmartials for those involved in the 
shootings the prosecutor col karlheinz boesel said it was too 
difficult to pin down exactly who fired the deadly shots 
the shoottokill orders formed one of the major sources of 
tension between east berlin and bonn for years they were also the 
primary reason why successive us administrations refused to 
invite honecker to washington 
in other developments friday 
shopping ground to a halt in east germany as stores closed to 
take inventory and restock almost empty shelves with western goods 
just two days before the introduction of the west german currency 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere predicted full 
german unification by the end of the year that is the same 
timetable outlined earlier in the week by the west germans 
the bonn government said chancellor helmut kohl will visit 
moscow on july 15 and 16 to discuss economic support for the 
kremlin west german officials said agreement was reached with the 
kremlin on financing the costs of the 380000 soviet troops in east 
germany for the second half of this year

american cyclist kevin foster dodging startled 
guards who wanted to arrest him whizzed down the last stretch of 
the great wall to reach the ocean friday completing his endtoend 
journey on the ancient monument 
four people who were waiting to greet foster were questioned for 
about an hour including two american businessmen who helped 
sponsor his journey 
it was kind of an exciting ending but not the ending i 
planned a sunburned and scratched foster said after returning to 
beijing by train the scratches came from bushes along the last 
stretch of wall 
he said the guards at shanhaiguan where the wall ends at the 
ocean were startled to see him and a chinese companion come 
shooting down the wall from a direction other than the ticket booth 
and turnstile for tourists 
foster said he ducked out of sight while the guards questioned 
professor li wenyan of the chinese academy of sciences institute 
of geography fosters chinese sponsor a chinese television 
reporter and bill and laroy van dyke brothers and top officers of 
the usbased bikeomatic company the company helped sponsor the 
trip 
foster 30 a parttime actor from ojai calif set out may 11 
to become the first person to bicycle on top of the wall from one 
end to the other 
he started at the walls westernmost pass jiayuguan in gansu 
province but had to skip a large stretch of wall that traverses a 
closed military area he walked alongside other portions of wall 
that are in ruins altogether bicycling 11748 miles of the 
3700milelong wall 
foster is the first person to bicycle any substantial distance 
on the monument which chinas emperors built more than 2000 years 
ago to keep out foreigners 
i was the first to do it that was the dream he said if 
someone else wants to do what i just did good luck 
the last few days ive been thinking not just about ending it 
but about taking a shower he added 
the 12 days he spent bicycling from beijing east to the ocean 
were the toughest he said because the wall snakes through 
mountainous terrain in places the manmade wall simply stops and 
yields to sheer cliffs 
i carried the bike more than rode it foster said there 
were a couple of times i went to take a step and there was a 
20foot drop i was able to grab the bushes and hold on 
he also encountered the worst bureaucratic barriers of the trip 
when local police began demanding he obtain a separate travel 
permit for each county he passed through they also said he could 
not sleep in villages near the wall but had to travel each night to 
the county seats 
i didnt enjoy the authority part he said meeting the 
people along the wall those were the best times 
foster said he is thinking about writing a book about his 
experiences 
chinese all along the route were fascinated by his custombuilt 
aluminum mountain bike much lighter than the black steel bicycles 
that are the main mode of transportation in china 
he is hoping his journey will be included in the guinness book 
of world records

a 71yearold vermont supreme court 
justice is stepping down from the bench after successfully fighting 
against the states mandatory retirement law 
justice louis peck said he has notified gov madeleine kunin of 
his intention to retire effective oct 1 
the state decided earlier this month not to appeal a federal 
court ruling upholding pecks right to remain despite a 
constitutional provision that all judges in vermont retire at age 
70 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled this spring that a 
federal law restricting mandatory retirement covers appointed state 
judges 
when peck turned 70 in december 1988 he refused to retire 
i felt strongly that if a person is in good health that person 
ought to be allowed to remain on the bench peck said thursday 
i kind of have mixed emotions my primary motivation was to test 
the law 
i have done that and now i feel i can retire he said 
the federal appeals court decision allowed peck to remain on the 
bench until his term ends in three years 
peck is considered the most conservative member of the states 
highest court he has written several stinging dissents to court 
decisions that he felt unfairly usurped the power of the 
legislature 
peck was appointed to the court in 1981 by thengov richard 
snelling a republican at the time peck was vermonts chief 
assistant attorney general 
his decision to retire means that kunin a democrat can appoint 
his replacement before she leaves office in january in doing so 
kunin will have named three of the courts five justices 
peck said his decision was prompted in part by early retirement 
incentives being offered in state government the program is part 
of an effort to reduce the number of state employees

police smashed open a door of the 
agriculture ministry with a sledgehammer tonight and stormed into 
the building to end a threeday sitin strike by farmers seeking 
guaranteed prices for their goods 
officers broke open a locked ministry door shortly before 730 
pm and scores of uniformed officers entered the building in 
central warsaw 
the move came after efforts to persuade the farmers to leave of 
their own volition failed it was not immediately known if officers 
encountered any resistance inside or if there were any arrests 
the government steadfastly had refused to negotiate with the 
protesters while the occupation continued 
earlier in the day police who had ringed the ministry withdrew 
after the 600 farmers had agreed to admit employees 
the police wagons had roared off on a ranking officers signal 
as the ministry workers filed in through an iron gate hung with a 
strike banner a parliament delegation also was admitted to meet 
with the farmers 
the growers are demanding minimum prices for their products as a 
shelter from the governments shock economic reform program they 
occupied the ministry wednesday afternoon following a protest march 
through warsaw they shut the building to employees on thursday 
agricultural minister czeslaw janicki and his deputies were 
permitted in this morning as the workers waited outside two dozen 
police vehicles then surrounded the building 
the government conditioned the start of serious negotiations on 
the farmers allowing the resumption of normal work at the ministry 
and ending their sitin 
the farmers who clustered in several ministry conference rooms 
said they would not conduct talks until the police were removed 
but they appeared divided over whether to agree to admit the 
workers and reversed their decision several times before allowing 
them in at midafternoon 
polish peasant party chairman roman bartoszcze met with the 
protesters late thursday to report on his discussions with prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki president wojciech jaruzelski and 
solidarity leader lech walesa 
walesa who was to return tonight from vienna said he would be 
available to help resolve the conflict bartoszcze said 
the solidarity leaders personal appeal won suspensions of the 
two other serious challenges to the mazowiecki reform program a 
strike by railway workers that disrupted transport across northwest 
poland in may and a blockade of the main warsawgdansk highway by 
dairy farmers in midjune 
mazowiecki will not give up on issues linked with guaranteed 
minimum prices and there will be no talks as long as farmers are 
occupying the ministerial building bartoszcze said according to 
the official pap news agency 
the farmers seek the governmentset minimum prices as a buffer 
against the effects of postcommunist polands drive to create a 
market economy out of the centralized socialized system of the 
last four decades 
a complex web of economic factors has pushed down farm prices 
one problem is that consumption has fallen in the face of price 
increases of up to 1000 percent in a year there is also a 
competitive glut of food donations from western nations who rushed 
to offer support to the new government 
the mazowiecki cabinet has repeatedly rejected demands for 
special treatment of any sector of the economy it has also refused 
to speak with railway workers or dairy farmers under the pressure 
of strike saying yielding once would produce a torrent of requests 
from other groups 
the government compares demands for minimum farm prices to the 
system of subsidies that the communist regime used to satisfy 
farmers while keeping consumer prices well below the actual cost of 
production 
the reform program cut most subsidies lifted price controls 
let interest rates rise to reflect the level of inflation and 
opened the economy to private ventures

president hashemi rafsanjani challenged 
antiwestern radicals in the government friday and said iran should 
be thankful for foreign aid for earthquake victims even if it 
comes from irans foes 
i dont think we see the people who are under the debris 
saying no we dont want foreign aid the president said at a 
moslem prayer gathering at tehran university 
his comment rebutted an editorial that appeared last week in the 
newspaper jomhuri islami the newspaper said people buried under 
rubble from the june 21 quake would still chant death to 
america and refuse aid from irans enemies such as the united 
states 
logic says if our people have no tents and the weather is bad 
we should accept foreign aid rafsanjani said the response and 
activities of the foreigners were really good and acceptable he 
added 
aid has poured into iran from dozens of countries since the 
temblor which measured 73 to 77 on the richter scale devastated 
cities and towns in northern iran the epicenter was about 125 
miles northwest of tehran and mainly affected the provinces of 
gilan and zanjan 
the iranian red crescent has put the casualties at 40000 dead 
and 60000 injured the official islamic republic news agency said 
three more aftershocks were felt thursday night one measured 5 on 
the richter scale 
nations that have offered relief help include the united states 
britain saudi arabia israel and other countries considered 
irans foes british author salman rushie condemned to death by 
iranian leaders last year for allegedly insulting islam in his 
novel the satanic verses also has contributed money 
hardliners in irans parliament last week said the offers of 
help should not lead to improved ties with the west antiwestern 
radicals in the government oppose any form of foreign assistance to 
the islamic republic 
newspapers aligned with differing factions in the government 
have debated whether the aid should be accepted 
so far iran has only rejected aid from israel and south africa 
rafsanjani did not comment friday on whether iran should improve 
relations with the west but he called for an end to criticism of 
the earthquake relief effort 
if someone comments only about the negative issues it will 
disappoint the people who have been working hard in the relief 
effort he said 
on thursday an iranian diplomatic official told the associated 
press that iran wants to improve its ties with all nations except 
for archenemies israel and south africa but he said the us 
government had spoiled an opportunity for better relations by 
giving only 295000 for quake relief 
its the amount of one house in california he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states announced wednesday it would send another 
shipment of emergency supplies bringing the total us government 
contribution to about 760000 
western diplomats in iran believe the quake aid will provide 
rafsanjani with the lever gradually to introduce more western 
investment in iran rafsanjani seeks foreign investment as a means 
of gaining technology to rebuild irans economy which was badly 
damaged by eight years of war with iraq 
he made no link friday between western aid and the release of 
western hostages held by proiranian groups in lebanon but iran 
has said western gestures of good will could prompt iran to further 
help obtain hostages freedom 
in washington on friday state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said aid from private american groups exceeds 4 million 
in addition to the government aid she denied she was volunteering 
the figures in response to iranian officials allegation that 
washington had not sent enough aid and refused to comment on that 
criticism 
the us government aid is still less than other countries 
sweden has donated 3 million and north korea announced it would 
give 1 million 
the president praised the relief efforts and noted the iranian 
people were also generous in their donations despite the hard 
conditions in the country due to the 198088 iraniraq war 
thousands of people kneeling in rows under a canvas to ward off 
the sun listened to rafsanjani they cheered and thrust their 
fists in the air when rafsanjani praised the iranian people and 
their sacrifices for the islamic revolution 
in other parts of the campus tens of thousands of others 
including women with their heads covered and wearing fulllength 
black chadors listened over a public address system 
rafsanjani also said iran should be better prepared for future 
earthquakes 
a quake is a natural phenomenon and of course everything is 
done by god rafsanjani said but that does not mean we should 
confine ourselves to prayers alone 
many buildings were destroyed which were not built according 
to specific scientific plans in this respect the president 
said in the future engineers and masons should keep these 
factors in mind 
rafsanjani pointed out that losses in california where a major 
earthquake struck in october were much reduced by such 
preparations 
the oct 17 earthquake in the san francisco bay area killed 68 
people it measured 71 on the richter scale 
shoddy construction was also blamed for the high death toll in 
the december 1988 earthquake in soviet armenia that quake measured 
69 on the richter scale and killed an estimated 25000 people

a woman walking her dog found 
frame sections from one of three stolen van goghs but police said 
friday they had no solid leads to the third van gogh theft from 
dutch museums in 25 months 
a 25member police task force was questioning museum staff 
friday although police said they believe thursdays postmidnight 
theft from the noordbrabants museum was not the work of insiders 
weve gotten tips in from all over the country and were busy 
checking them out right now said police spokesman jacques 
brummans but the golden tip still hasnt come in 
the thieves police believe there were three jumped several 
fences and smashed through a reinforced groundfloor window to gain 
entry to the museum 
a sophisticated alarm system was not functioning in the gallery 
where the paintings were kept 
stolen were three early preimpressionist works by the 
19thcentury dutch artist the sitting farmers wife the 
digging farmers wife and wheels of the water mill in gennep 
the museum in this city 53 miles south of amsterdam set the 
total worth of the paintings at between 27 million and 54 
million 
it was the third theft of van gogh works from dutch museums 
since may 1988 
four paintings stolen earlier from the kroellermueller museum 
in otterloo in the eastern netherlands and amsterdams municipal 
museum have all been recovered 
police arrived at the scene of thursdays theft within minutes 
of receiving phone calls from neighbors who reported hearing glass 
shatter 
the museum said two separate security systems to detect 
intruders seismic sensors to measure movement and infrared eyes 
to measure body heat failed 
peter veenland the museums deputy director said thursday 
there were indicators that should have signaled the faults in the 
systems and those indicators failed as well 
a 24yearold art student told police she found pieces of the 
van gogh picture frame early thursday in a street behind the 
museum brummans said 
police confirmed the segments were from one of the stolen 
paintings 
it didnt look so nice so i just left it there anita van de 
ven told amsterdams de telegraaf newspaper 
brummans said police were investigating the womans report that 
she saw a white mercedes speeding by her near where she found the 
frame pieces

its chili in dallas sourdough in san francisco 
pizza in chicago and jambalaya down new orleans way but in this 
new england city clam chowder is whats famous and having the best 
is a restaurateurs dream 
thats why chefs were slaving friday over steaming 150gallon 
vats of soup for this weekends annual chowderfest whose winner 
will be judged by about 15000 amateur tasters 
having the best chowder in boston pays off big said manager 
steve bidgood of the chart house which won last year our 
chowder business went up by 50 percent last year 
of course youve got to take the risk before reaping the return 
entering this competition which is in its ninth year requires 
hundreds of dollars and hours of work 
it cost close to 2300 last year said bidgood whose 
restaurant is part of a nationwide chain and that doesnt 
include the 250 entry fee or the insurance binders for employees 
in case one of them gets hurt 
his chef john doherty requires among other things 30 pounds of 
bacon 50 pounds of onions eight cases of heavy cream 100 pounds 
of potatoes a rowboat full of clams and a very very big pot 
dohertys product will be among a dozen entries sunday at city 
hall plaza where for 6 each everyday folk become instant judges 
and fill their bellies with chowder to boot 
their votes are scribbled on ticket stubs and tallied by the 
accounting firm ernst amp young we take this seriously said 
spokeswoman toni pollak of boston harborfest a weeklong festival 
featuring the chowder challenge 
restaurant managers and their staff become carnival barkers of 
sorts wooing votes with smiles songs and of course creamy clam 
chowder 
theres quite a bit of rivalry pollak said it hasnt 
gotten cutthroat yet but the hawking sometimes gets pretty loud 
a lot more than a silver revere bowl is at stake 
restaurants use it for marketing throughout the year because 
obviously its nice to say youve got the best in boston pollak 
said 
we were very disappointed coming in only second last year when 
we were number one in 1988 said debbie allen who manages the 
last hurrah at the 134yearold omniparker house 
so what exactly is in the brew restaurateurs will give you the 
basics but admit with a sly smile that just a couple of secret 
touches might be omitted 
for the whole story you might try turners fisheries which was 
taken out of the competition and inducted into the chowderfest hall 
of fame after taking consecutive victories in 198486 
turners fisheries prints its recipe on the backs of menus that 
disappear at a rate of about 20 a day the restaurant will give out 
samples but wont compete sunday 
i think they were getting a little upset with our sweeping 
three years in a row said ellen lynch spokeswoman for the 
downtown westin hotel that houses the restaurant 
but its the peoples choice afterall 
when you come to new england you want that thick creamy 
clammy lot of clams chowder bidgood said people are 
picky theyll tell you if they think your potato chunks are too 
big

east germans tried to unload their communist 
currency friday on enough food to get through a historic weekend 
but stores shut down to wait for the fatter profits of the free 
market 
stores all week have been clearing shelves and closing doors to 
wait for western products that they can sell to east germans who 
will suddenly have western currency 
the trend has created severe shortages of food and household 
products a situation that peaked in east berlin and other cities 
friday 
east germany ends four decades of socialism and its economic 
autonomy as a nation sunday when it merges its economy with west 
germanys 
the cornerstone of the economic union is the conversion of east 
germanys nearly worthless marks into west german marks 
banks will be open sunday so east germans can withdraw their 
first convertible cash and stores will open monday filled with 
products from the west 
east berliner johanna suska said she was spending the last of 
her east german currency on enough food to get through the first 
week of the economic union 
our local department store is completely empty she said 
there is just some bread and milk sugar and flour 
mrs suska a mother of five said she welcomed the economic 
union even though she already has been laid off from her job at an 
agricultural research firm 
analysts predict that 1 million to 4 million east germans will 
lose their jobs as their inefficient enterprises face competition 
from the west 
west german officials sought to assure east germans that the 
widespread factory closings and joblessness expected in the coming 
weeks will coincide with a surge in western investment 
east german economics minister helmut haussmann said 500000 new 
jobs could be created in the shortterm future and that an east 
german boom is imminent 
long lines continued at banks as people filled out applications 
to convert their savings 
east german lawmakers tried to prevent former communist 
officials who may have accumulated large amounts of money from 
benefiting from the currency conversion 
parliament voted friday to require the east german state bank to 
report the names of east germans with more than 100000 marks in 
their bank accounts the average bank account has between 5000 and 
10000 marks 
officials are encouraging east germans to be thrifty with their 
new west german marks economists fear a mass spending free will 
dilute the strength of the mark and lead to inflation 
sigfried guterman a spokesman for the west german central bank 
the bundesbank said there are early indications that east germans 
will save their money 
people who have been filling out the currency conversion forms 
are required to list the size of their initial withdrawal the 
average amount east germans plan to withdraw is about 800 marks or 
500 guterman said 
people seem to be quite thrifty he said the figure is 
far below what was expected we do not expect a spending spree 
stores have been snubbing both the old communist currency and 
the electronics equipment household goods and food produced by 
their countrymen 
at a paint and wallpaper shop in the city of bernau north of 
berlin owner rainer selch said he shut his store this week to 
renovate and keep from accumulating east german marks 
he was expecting a delivery of west german paint on monday and 
said he had no qualms about cutting his orders for east german 
paint 
people want the west products he said 
if you try to keep these factories when they should fail it 
will only harm people more he said radical fast change is 
best going slow will only be worse

president bush expressed concern friday over 
the deadlock in the middle east peace process and said the united 
states has no intention of abandoning its pursuit of a settlement 
despite recent setbacks 
were not going to sit here and do nothing bush told a news 
conference the united states will persist even if the yearlong 
effort to set up israelipalestinian talks gets totally 
stiffarmed bush said 
bush refused to characterize a letter he had received thursday 
night from israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir in response to an 
earlier message the president had sent state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler also refused to comment 
but reports from israel said shamir in his letter expressed 
renewed interest in opening a dialogue with palestinians 
i am concerned about a deadlock in the peace process bush 
said his letter to shamir inquired about the israeli leaders 
intentions now that the political paralysis in that country has 
ended with the formation of a new government 
we will be analyzing the shamir response very very carefully 
and hopefully bush said he added that he places high priority 
on finding enough flexibility in the letter to get talks started 
it is essential the status quo is unacceptable to 
everybody bush said the opening of talks between israel and the 
palestinians he said has to happen 
according to sources shamir in his response reaffirmed his 
commitment to his own proposal for elections among palestinian 
arabs on the west bank and gaza strip he also said he continues to 
support efforts by secretary of state james a baker iii to 
implement the plan 
a key stumbling block has been whether to exclude palestinians 
who had been deported by israel from participating in proposed 
israelipalestinian discussions on the election plan 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the prime 
minister did not specifically exclude palestinians deported from 
the territories israeli radio meanwhile quoted shamir as saying 
he disagrees with the participation of deportees and arabs from 
jerusalem in the talks 
israel has opposed participation by a representative from east 
jerusalem because to do otherwise might suggest that the status of 
the city was open to negotiation 
the israeli radio broadcast said shamir also told bush he is 
ready to continue to cooperate with secretary baker to advance a 
dialogue with a palestinian delegation that will be composed on a 
namebyname basis 
israeli television said shamir ruled out participation by 
deportees chosen by the plo 
there were published accounts friday that shamir had rejected 
us proposals for israelipalestinian talks in apparent response 
to those reports the 21nation arab league issued a statement 
accusing shamir of intransigence and an irreversible 
commitment to stonewalling 
the statement said the united nations should send a security 
council team to the occupied territories and should start preparing 
for an international conference this is the only course 
available to salvage the peace option in the middle east it said

president mikhail s gorbachev warned top 
communist party leaders on friday that they must avoid a split at 
next weeks key congress that is to plot the partys future course 
a spokesman said 
gorbachev and his allies argue that disintegration of the 
partys proreform movement would weaken it against conservatives 
who dominated last weeks founding congress of the communist party 
of the russian republic 
the central committee the policymaking body of the 19million 
member party tentatively approved a report that gorbachev will 
deliver monday at the 28th congress of the soviet communist party 
where conservatives will be strongly represented 
but the 249member committee ordered the politburo to rework 
it taking into account discussion during a threehour 
fortyminute closeddoor kremlin meeting said alexander kapto 
head of the central committee ideological department 
as the national congress approached gorbachevs moderate and 
reformist allies appeared to be on the offensive the state news 
agency tass warned that dumping gorbachev as party leader could 
spell disaster and a politburo member said hardliners were 
pursuing a suicidal course 
gorbachev was also trying to head off a split threatened by the 
radical democratic platform whose members want faster reforms 
within the party and have instructed their delegates to walk out 
speaking to reporters at a news conference after the plenum 
kapto quoted gorbachev as saying the crucial issue is to ensure 
the consolidation of party members 
the congress also will debate whether the president should be 
allowed to also serve as party leader as gorbachev does now 
conservatives want gorbachev to give up his party job 
the moderates appeared to be having some success stemming the 
conservative tide before the congress 
the most prominent hardliner on the politburo yegor k 
ligachev said in an interview with the rabochaya tribuna newspaper 
that he had absolute confidence in gorbachevs authority and 
that the congress would focus on the fate of the country and the 
party rather than on individuals 
in the weeks leading to the congress the party has been in 
increasing disarray kapto said 130000 members had recently quit 
the party but declined to specify over what period 
the 4683 delegates to the congress will vote on party 
leadership posts including the general secretary and central 
committee and it might vote on whether to change the name of the 
senior post to chairman and create two new jobs vice chairmen 
kapto said 
the committee did not discuss the question of postponing the 
congress as proposed this week by reformer boris n yeltsin in 
order slow the conservative thrust its inaction means that the 
congress will proceed as scheduled monday 
yeltsin later told state television that all of our arguments 
are ahead of us 
delegates spent the day registering for the congress kapto said 
the meeting was expected to last about 10 days but could end when 
the delegates wanted 
the congress is to assess the state of economic reform 
relations between the party and trade unions as well as the results 
of last weeks congress of the communist party of the russian 
federation by far the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
conservatives lambasted gorbachev at the congress and its 2700 
delegates will represent the republic at the soviet party congress 
moderates originally had scheduled the congress as a means of 
cleaning hardliners out of leadership posts but conservatives 
controlled delegate selection and were threatening to dominate the 
session 
a gorbachev ally yevgeny primakov a nonvoting member of the 
politburo which runs the party on a daytoday basis accused the 
conservatives of suicide policies 
and to oppose perestroika is suicidal for any political leader 
now said primakov who is also a member of gorbachevs advisory 
presidential council 
the strength of conservatives in the party has raised threats of 
a walkout by radical reformers who support gorbachevs 
perestroika reforms aimed at restructuring the economy by 
introducing market mechanisms and greater political freedoms 
the congress also was to discuss the partys falling influence 
among the workers that is supposed to represent kapto said

newhome sales last month rose a meager 04 
percent at an annual rate but were still at virtually their 
lowest level since the economy emerged from its last recession 7 
years ago 
the government said friday that the increase from an annual 
sales rate of 530000 homes in april to a rate of 532000 homes 
last month was the first gain in six months since the despite 
their first increase in six months 
most analysts attributed the continuing sales weakness to 
doubledigit mortgage rates but some said flagging consumer 
confidence also has become a major factor as the job market weakens 
and wage growth slows 
the commerce department reported new home sales totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 532000 units in may after 
falling 52 percent the previous month 
but the april decline was even worse than the 16 percent drop 
first reported last month and the rate of sales in both months was 
the lowest since 521000 rate in december 1982 the 198182 
recession ended that november 
the pace of sales during the first five months of 1990 was down 
96 percent from the same period last year actual sales in 1989 
totaled 650000 down from 676000 units in 1988 
analysts also expressed concern over the high inventory level 
while mays 82month backlog slipped from the 84month inventory 
in april it matched the 82month level of july 1982 during the 
last recession 
the backlog suggests that were going to have some problems 
down the road until sales pick up a little bit said thomas 
holloway an economist with the mortgage bankers association 
robert villanueva forecasting director for the national 
association of home builders said the uncomfortably high level 
of unsold houses also suggests that housing starts will continue 
to be weak in order to bring starts in line with demand 
the national association of realtors which monitors existing 
home sales reported earlier this week that resales of 
singlefamily homes had declined 12 percent in may to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 329 million existing home sales have 
fallen every month this year except for march when they were 
unchanged 
but holloway and other analysts predicted falling mortgage rates 
will stimulate home sales in the months ahead 
rates have fallen about half of what they went up and that has 
to have some positive effect on sales david berson chief 
economist with the federal national mortgage association said 
they may not go up by much but they will go up over the course 
of the year 
mortgage rates peaked this year at 1067 percent at the 
beginning of may before falling to 1033 percent at months end 
according to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
martin regalia an economist with the national council of 
savings institutions cited consumer caution as another reason for 
the weakness in the housing market 
when consumer uncertainty increases big discretionary 
purchases big new cars big new houses those kinds of things 
that can be delayed are the first to get delayed he explained 
the commerce department said the median price of a new home in 
may was 128500 down 37 percent from the april cost the median 
means half of the homes cost more half less the average price of 
a new home was 150400 down 25 pecent from the previous price 
sales in the sluggish northeast market which had risen 93 
percent in april fell back 56 percent in may to 84000 units at 
an annual rate some analysts had said the april pace could not be 
sustained 
sales also fell in the south down 10 percent to 199000 units 
sales rose elsewhere they were up 79 percent to 96000 units 
in the midwest and 48 percent to 152000 units in the west

nasa is impounding decadeold equipment and 
records as it begins investigating design defects that have 
crippled the 15 billion hubble space telescope a senior agency 
scientist told a senate panel friday 
but the official lennard a fisk said he was not certain that 
all of the vital information would be found and the chairman of 
the senate subcommittee looking into the situation said it was 
symptomatic of broader problems at the space agency 
sen albert gore jr dtenn accused nasa of having an 
attitude that emphasizes big exciting new projects at the expense 
of the mundane work necessary to make sure old ones are carried out 
properly 
nasas eyes are bigger than its stomach gore charged 
later he added we have been assured now for 12 years that 
everything was all right we owe it to the taxpayers to find out 
what went wrong how to fix it and make sure it never happens 
again 
fisk the senior nasa scientist told the senate commerce 
science subcommittee that the agency has assembled a review board 
of worldrenowned experts led by lew allen head of the jet 
propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
he promised ultimately to give as clean a possible answer as 
we can but he also said i am somewhat concerned that we are 
going to try and reconstruct an event that took place a decade 
ago 
in further troubles for nasa while fisk answered questions 
about the problems of hubble engineers at the kennedy space center 
discovered a new problem with the space shuttle 
a hydrogen leak in space shuttle atlantis was found during a 
special test and nasa space flight chief william lenoir said the 
shuttle fleet was being grounded until the leak was corrected 
the leak was similar to a leak that led to postponing a flight 
last month of the space shuttle columbia 
lenoir said nasa will not launch any of the shuttles until 
engineers have isolated the leak corrected it and tested to make 
sure it is fixed 
scientists are virtually certain the telescopes problem is that 
images collected by its two main mirrors do not focus precisely 
enough an error caused in the grinding of the mirrors that work 
was done by the hughes danbury optical co of connecticut between 
1979 to 1981 fisk said 
in the context of putting together a very complex observatory 
we did not expect this to be part of the problem fisk said 
achieving precise specifications in mirrors is a routine part of 
an optical system 
the mirrors were tested individually but were never tried as an 
assembly in what nasa calls an endtoend test he said the 
endtoend test was judged not to have a good costtobenefit 
ratio fisk said 
and he reminded gore that was a very turbulent time in the 
history of the hubble space telescope replete with cost overruns 
and management problems 
fisk sought to put the best face on the problem saying that 
while some kinds of scientific work have been seriously 
compromised other valuable work can still be accomplished until 
1993 when the problem might be repaired by a space shuttle mission 
we will adjust the observing program to emphasize the things 
that hubble does well today such as ultraviolet imagery fisk 
said 
he said the telescopes effectiveness should be measured by its 
discoveries over its entire 15year lifespan and promised you 
will marvel at the discoveries that are going to come from the 
observations hubble is capable of today do not assume that 
hubble is crippled from doing firstclass worldclass science that 
cannot be done in any other way 
but hervey stockman deputy director of a baltimorebased 
consortium of university astronomy departments said the problem 
has already caused a change in the underlying philosophy that 
governs what the telescope should be used for 
plans had been for the most critical exacting and potentially 
valuable explorations to be made during the hubbles first year of 
operation in case something were to go wrong later many of those 
projects involved deepspace imaging of complex or dim formations 
those programs naturally have suffered stockman said 
he said the consortium the space telescope science institute 
was heartened that 50 percent of the current program remains alive 
and that correction of the hubbles problem should be relatively 
simple

portauprince haiti ap the independent electoral council 
on friday proposed general elections be held nov 4 about two 
months later than had been anticipated 
the council published its longawaited draft electoral law 
establishing the ground rules for haitis first free and fair 
balloting since popular protests toppled the regime of jeanclaude 
baby doc duvalier in february 1986 
the draft was presented at a press conference and delivered to 
political parties which were invited to propose changes a revised 
law will be given within a week to president ertha pascaltrouillot 
for official proclamation 
jean casimir secretary general of the council told a press 
conference the 162article law will reconcile a divided nation 
by ensuring equality of rural and urban voters guaranteeing equal 
chances for all candidates and providing for voter security 
the united nations and organization of american states will 
provide technical and voteverification assistance in this 
caribbean nation of 55 million residents he said haiti is one of 
the poorest countries in the western hemisphere with an annual per 
capita income of about 330 
many haitians doubt credible elections can be held this year due 
to an upsurge in violent crime that began with the installation of 
the ninemember electoral council on may 2 
haitis last attempt to hold independent elections on nov 29 
1987 was aborted when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked 
to death at least 34 voters at polling stations 
last weeks attack on the council of state which governs 
alongside pascaltrouillot cast further doubt on plans for general 
elections which some politicians had said would be held in 
september 
two human rights organizations said this week that the 
military continues to function without any control of civilian 
authority 
a visiting delegation from the americas watch and the national 
coalition for haitian refugees both based in new york stated 
the dangerous combination of massacres in the countryside 
arbitrary criminal violence in portauprince and now the direct 
attack on the council of state threatens to transform future 
elections into a mere voting formality rather than a manifestation 
of the will of the people 
jeanrobert sabalat president of the governing council told 
reporters friday the army had ensured the security of council 
members earlier in the week he had complained of the lack of 
police protection 
since the ouster of president jeanclaude duvalier in 1986 
haiti has been ruled by five successive governments mrs 
pascaltrouillots caretaker government subject to council veto 
power was established on march 13 after a popular uprising 
toppled dictator lt gen prosper avril

the space shuttle fleet is grounded the 
hubble space telescope is crippled but hey how about some good 
news the observatory still may search for other solar systems that 
might harbor alien life 
its entirely possible we can still do that despite a flaw 
that prevents proper focusing of the telescopes mirrors said jim 
westphal principal scientist in charge of research using the 
hubbles main camera we should know a week from now 
if this is true it is both welcome news and an indication 
that science can progress even while the big parts of the hubble 
program and the space program in general are down said louis 
friedman executive director of the planetary society space 
exploration advocacy group 
the national aeronautics and space administration announced 
friday it was grounding the nations space shuttle fleet because a 
hydrogen leak was discovered in a second shuttle two days earlier 
the agency said an apparent error in manufacturing one of the 15 
billion hubble space telescopes mirrors left them unable to focus 
light correctly 
three of the telescopes five instruments will be able to do 50 
percent to 75 percent of their planned studies but the main camera 
the widefield and planetary camera will be of little use until 
shuttle astronauts make repairs in 1993 said ed weiler a top nasa 
scientist the faintobject camera will be able to conduct about 
half its planned research he said thursday 
westphal said later however that the widefield camera still 
may be able to carry out plans to study six to eight nearby stars 
for several years to see if they wobble a sign they are being 
tugged by gravity from orbiting planets 
for that purpose we dont really care how sharp the image is 
because the telescope simply must accurately determine the stars 
position relative to stars around it westphal said by phone from 
maryland where he was helping nasa officials deal with the 
hubbles troubles 
if lots of stars have planets then the chances that some of 
those planets might have life on them is better and ultimately the 
chance there might be intelligent life somewhere is greater he 
said 
the hubble couldnt detect life on other planets even if it 
worked perfectly but westphal said that by finding planets it 
could bring scientists one step closer to the answer to one of 
the most interesting of all questions is there anybody else out 
there 
the search potentially has enormous implications for 
understanding our evolution and the evolution of planetary systems 
ultimately leading one day to learning whether there are 
inhabitable planets around other stars friedman said the key 
question here is whether life is unique 
during the past decade astronomers found indirect evidence that 
more than three dozen stars seem to be surrounded either by 
flattened disks of dust possibly young solar systems in the 
process or forming planets or by planetlike objects known as 
brown dwarfs 
the stars westphal hopes the telescope can observe are much 
closer and are considered nearby or within 10 light years of 
earth thats almost 60 trillion miles 
trying to see a jupitersize planet orbiting a nearby star often 
has been compared to a person trying to see a speck of dust miles 
away when that speck is sitting next to a 1000watt light bulb 
despite the focusing problem the hubbles main camera still 
should be able to search for planets outside our solar system five 
times more effectively than any telescope on earth westphal said 
test photographs show about 85 percent of the light that enters 
the camera is not properly focused but about 15 percent is where 
it belongs and makes a nice little sharp image he explained 
so we anticipate that we can probably use that little sharp core 
to watch for stars to wobble

city council on friday censured an alderman who 
was accused of fabricating a poisoned sausage scare and has 
threatened to terrorize the city with a black militant group he 
formed 
the councils symbolic action approved 113 rebukes alderman 
michael r mcgee for his past statements and asks him to promote 
harmony and understanding in the city 
mcgee 40 who earlier this week resigned his council committee 
posts over the sausage incident wore the black fatigue uniform of 
his black panther militia to the meeting which he called a 
lynching 
this hearing means nothing to me whatsoever whoever votes for 
this i could care less he said during a speech from the floor 
it just confirms my statements of how racist this city is 
the censure was urged after mcgee reported june 22 he received 
an anonymous phone call from a militant underground group claiming 
that products of usingers famous sausage inc had been injected 
with rat poison 
the warning forced usingers to recall 80000 pounds of meat 
from 150 stores an inspection by the company found none of the 
meat was tainted 
usingers and other downtown companies along third street have 
opposed mcgees proposal to rename all of street for the late civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr segments of the street are 
already named for king 
mayor john o norquist and others alleged mcgee fabricated the 
scare to gain media attention the mayor called the alderman a 
demented fool and said the sausage scare was a hoax 
mcgee has said he will sue norquist for slander but during 
fridays meeting he withdrew a motion asking the council to 
censure norquist and other aldermen for their statements against 
him 
earlier this year mcgee started the black panther militia 
which he says will use terrorist strikes beginning in 1995 if 
conditions in milwaukees inner city including segregation 
unemployment crime and teenage pregnancy dont improve 
mcgee one of three blacks on the 16member council has 
repeatedly cited studies showing milwaukee is one of the worst us 
cities in terms of teenage pregnancy and black neighborhood 
isolation 
he says his militia has about 500 members including many young 
street gang members 
the censure vote was the first in milwaukee history city clerk 
ronald d leonhardt said 
norquist on friday said the censure saying mcgee should have 
been punished for his reckless calls for violence against his 
community 
mcgee did not vote one of the other blacks on the council voted 
against censure the other was not present 
one of the three alderman to oppose the censure john kalwitz 
said mcgee had not been given due process and the censure would not 
help poor residents in mcgees district 
no amount of censure or reprimand condemnation or 
denouncement will change the stark reality of alderman mcgees and 
others assessment of the social and economic conditions we find in 
the city of milwaukee kalwitz said

supporters expect sales of the coins to raise 35 million which 
will be split equally between the mount rushmore memorial society 
and the us treasury 
the society plans to use the money for repairing the stone 
carvings and renovating the visitors center at the base of the 
mountain 
extreme temperatures in the black hills of south dakota have 
caused cracks in the sculpted faces as the rock expands and

in a move widely believed aimed at rightwing 
leader jeanmarie le pen the national assembly approved a strict 
antiracism law friday that would bar anyone convicted of promoting 
racism from holding elected office for five years 
the law also would require news media that report racist 
statements to give targeted groups the right to respond and it 
classifies as a crime the propagation of revisionist history 
questioning the existence or extent of the holocaust 
the bill now goes before the senate which refused to consider 
an earlier version but the assembly has the power to enact it into 
law if the senate rejects it a second time 
in france the debate about racism has been closely linked with 
debate over immigration it took another twist last month after the 
discovery of desecrated graves in a jewish cemetery in carpentras 
southern france 
le pen leader of the farright national front has advocated 
deportation of north african immigrants and called the nazi gas 
chambers a detail of history his party and the mainstream 
centerright parties have accused the socialists of failing to 
control immigration 
the socialists have accused le pens party of creating a climate 
of racial animosity but the government has bowed to public opinion 
by proposing tighter curbs on immigration and shelving a plan to 
give immigrants voting rights in local elections 
under the racism bill anyone convicted of practicing or 
promoting racial discrimination could be barred from holding any 
elected office or government job for five years 
the bill passed on a 308265 vote supported unanimously by the 
governing socialist party and the communist party and opposed 
unanimously by centrist and conservative lawmakers 
le figaro a leading conservative newspaper denounced the bill 
as an infringement on freedom of the press and freedom of opinion 
faced with this proposition the infinite silence of 
practically all jurists and practically all historians is 
frightening le figaro said 
le pen has also called the proposed law undemocratic 
he was charged with racial defamation thursday for a remark 
about international jewry in a newspaper interview 
le pen said he was being prosecuted for one sentence in an 
interview published by the daily newspaper present in august 1989 
he said that international jewry plays a nonnegligible role in 
creating an antinational spirit 
meanwhile liberation a leftofcenter daily said friday that 
france ranks as the no 1 offender in a survey of western european 
racism to be published next month by a european parliament inquiry 
commission 
trailing france in order were britain italy belgium and west 
germany liberation said among european community members racism 
was least prevalent in ireland but that was likely due to the 
minimal presence of immigrants from outside europe the newspaper 
said 
germans and belgians were the most likely to describe themselves 
as racist the reports author glyn ford was quoted as saying 
but the violence and racial hatred in these two countries is 
nothing compared to the level in france britain and italy 
quoting ford a british member of the europarliaments socialist 
group liberation said france had recorded 20 racist murders since 
1986 
too often the penalties imposed or steps taken against these 
killers were so light that immigrants felt there was no justice for 
them ford was quoted as saying 
according to liberation the upcoming report expresses concern 
about farright sympathizers in the french police who may have 
colluded with perpetrators of racist attacks

a controversial bill that could allow tens of 
thousands of hong kong residents to enter britain when the colony 
comes under chinese rule in 1997 passed its most important 
legislative hurdle in the house of lords on friday 
the british nationality bill approved 15 days ago by the 
elected house of commons had a second reading in the unelected 
upper chamber of parliament it will now go through the house of 
lords committee stage 
the second reading is traditionally the most important stage for 
a bill in the house of lords because that is the point at which it 
is most likely to get killed 
the lords can approve bills amend them with the commons 
approval or reject proposed legislation 
the chinese governments bloody crackdown on prodemocracy 
students in beijing in june 1989 led many of hong kongs nearly 6 
million people to worry about what might happen to them when they 
come under chinas rule 
but when the possibility was raised in london of granting 
british residence to the 325 million people in hong kong entitled 
to british passports there was a revolt by some members of the 
governing conservative party 
foreign secretary douglas hurd has said he wants key people to 
remain in hong kong after the handover and the best way to do that 
is to give them the security of knowing they have a british 
passport if they dislike the realities of communist rule 
under the bill 50000 hong kong residents and their households 
would be selected on a point system from a wide variety of fields 
to receive british passports estimates have been made that the new 
law could give the right of settlement to a total of 225000 people 
during the lords second reading dr john habgood the 
archbishop of york said he had recently visited hong kong and 
found that church congregations had dropped by 30 percent because 
citizens were leaving the colony 
we did not find very much trust in the british intentions 
habgood said it was sad to find the word betrayal used over 
and over again 
habgood said fears of a mass exodus to britain were groundless 
because many hong kong residents found british society too 
restricted 
most people are not interested in coming here they dont 
particularly like britain if they had to live elsewhere they would 
rather go to australia canada or the united states habgood 
said adding that he supported the bill as it represented the most 
that was politically possible 
liberal democrat lord bonhamcarter called for other countries 
to grant hong kong residents the right of abode 
i believe that we should also appeal to our partners in the 
united states and the commonwealth to join us in providing an 
insurance policy he said 
an opposition labor party member lord mishcon said he realized 
britain could not grant the right of abode to all of hong kongs 6 
million citizens but the government should do more to guarantee 
democracy 
we must use all the pressure we can to get agreement to it by 
chinas government he said

a mixup of two patients with the same 
last name caused the wrong man to receive the aidsinfected blood 
of the other hospital officials said 
this is an absolute tragedy we are devastated by this said 
dr darwin palmer chief of infectious diseases at veterans 
administration medical center 
the error was discovered within an hour he said 
if this patient who is very ill lives long enough he will 
unfortunately have a good chance of developing the aids virus 
infection palmer said 
the hospital immediately notified the patient about the error 
wednesday and offered him highdose antiviral therapy including 
the drug azt in an effort to stave off infection palmer said 
the hospital said it would not release either mans identity or 
name the ailment the wrongly injected man suffered from 
the male patients had recently undergone a rare blood test 
within 24 hours of each other palmer said 
the blood test an indium white blood cell scan uses a 
radioactive tracer to find sources of infection blood samples are 
taken and treated with the chemical indium then returned to the 
patient to see where the trace element shows up in the body 
usually a patients name identification number and armband are 
checked and the patient is questioned about the test before 
injection palmer said 
i have to assume they did all these things but they didnt 
look closely enough said palmer also a professor at the 
university of new mexico school of medicine 
the question of liability remains undetermined but it appeared 
several people were involved in the mistake palmer said 
we are investigating very hard to see where the slipup 
occurred to see it doesnt occur again he said

the lithuanian parliament on friday 
agreed to a 100day moratorium on its declaration of independence 
in an exchange for an end to the economic blockade ordered by 
mikhail s gorbachev 
lithuanias president vytautas landsbergis said he expects the 
10weekold blockade by the kremlin on all supplies of oil and most 
natural gas to the breakaway republic to be lifted on saturday 
further negotiations between gorbachev and lithuanian leaders 
over the status of this baltic republic of 38 million residents 
are to continue under fridays compromise 
asked if he was happy with the result of the long debate 
landsbergis told reporters no its too complicated earlier 
in the day he backed off his reservations about accepting a 
compromise to endorse the moratorium 
the 100day moratorium passed by a vote of 6935 will take 
effect at the start of negotiations with moscow landsbergis would 
not say how soon those talks could begin 
supporters said the deal allows soviet president gorbachev to 
save face while giving lithuania its freedom 
top lithuanian officials said in two facetoface meetings with 
landsbergis this week that gorbachev gave up his demands lithuania 
completely rescind the march 11 declaration of independence and 
return to the soviet union fold subject to the complex soviet 
secession law 
gorbachevs willingness to work out a deal with the lithuanians 
comes just days before a critical communist party congress where 
there may be a challenge to his party leadership by traditionalists 
the moratorium will cover only the declaration of independence 
itself and none of the laws passed since then legislator jonas 
tamulis said the moratorium will have little effect because its 
provisions are repeated in the subsequent legislation 
soviet officials have not commented on lithuanian reports about 
details of the agreement but lithuanias leadership assured 
deputies the main elements had been approved by gorbachev 
landsbergis said in answer to deputies questions that gorbachev 
made it clear his only demand was a moratorium on the declaration 
itself the final wording of the resolution was not significantly 
different from the draft presented to gorbachev on wednesday night 
lithuanian deputy audrius rudys warned parliament to act before 
the congress because conservatives are on the attack 
we may be at that historic point in time where we could decide 
the whole future of lithuania rudys said we need to think 
what would happen if another person came instead of gorbachev 
would he be better disposed toward lithuania what if its 
polozkov 
communist party conservative ivan k polozkov was elected leader 
of the huge russian republics communist party two weeks ago the 
russian republic is the largest and most populous of the soviet 
unions 15 republics 
the soviets in midapril began blocking all oil and most natural 
gas shipments authorities also cut off supplies of sugar fish 
coffee tea and dried and citrus fruit lithuanians officials said 
about 50000 of the estimated 11 million workers in lithuania 
lost their jobs due to the shortages of fuel and raw materials 
despite the damage done to lithuanias economy by the embargo 
it is in evidence only slightly in the capital city of lithuania 
many workers are still earning vacation pay heat is unnecessary 
in summer and a thriving black market is providing plenty of 
gasoline for private cars at five times the official price 
because of this many lithuanians opposed the moratorium 
i think we lost said alexandra vasiliauskiene a retiree 
who was demonstrating against the moratorium outside parliament 
the blockade will not be lifted 
another demonstrator ona butkiene 58 burst into tears when 
she heard the parliaments decision the communists have won 
she said 
several opponents of the resolution said they feared they were 
being tricked 
legislator klemas inta said if the kremlin has not removed the 
blockade by monday he will demand the resolution be rescinded 
parliament was sharply divided on the issue of trusting 
gorbachev to follow through on the deal 
opponents delayed the vote by arguing over minute wording 
changes some wanted to see what direction the communist party 
congress in moscow would take before they voted 
many legislators gave their approval only after landsbergis 
dropped his own longstanding doubts shortly before the vote 
two years ago we chose the peaceful route to independence 
the route of negotiations landsbergis told parliament now the 
condition for negotiations is a moratorium 
the resolution adopted by the parliament suspends legal 
actions flowing from this act but it made clear other decisions 
adopted after the declaration will remain in force that includes 
replacement of the soviet constitution with a lithuanian document 
the resolution also says the lithuanian parliament can prolong 
or cancel the moratorium it says the moratorium will expire 
automatically if parliament is unable to fulfill its duties 
that was a reference to some legislators fears that the 
compromise offer would give soviet authorities an opening to 
replace the legislature 
lithuania and its baltic neighbors latvia and estonia were 
independent from moscow between the two world wars but were 
absorbed back into the soviet union by josef stalin in 1940

more than 1200 inmates who live by a 
brutal code of each man for himself in prison stood together friday 
as trained firefighters against southern california blazes that had 
killed one of them 
despite the danger the inmates say they prefer the job over the 
alternative 
its better than doing time behind the wall you eat better 
its less violent there are better surroundings said inmate 
firefighter william r marcott 
on wednesday 16 inmates were overrun by a wildfire in riverside 
county victor f ferrara 22 serving time for assault with a 
deadly weapon died thursday night at a san bernardino hospital 
said state prison spokesman tip kindel four remain hospitalized 
one in critical condition 
in arizona a blaze tuesday killed five inmate firefighters and 
a supervisor 
hearing about the others makes you wonder it scares you 
getting killed crosses your mind especially when you go on a 
bigcampaign fire said marcott 30 who is serving time at green 
valley conservation camp near sacramento for assault with a deadly 
weapon 
marcott fought a los padres national forest fire last year 
during which an inmate firefighter was killed the first fatality 
in the california inmate firefighting program since it began in 
1946 
the state prison system and the state department of forestry and 
fire protection jointly operate the program 
its one of the most highly praised programs it gives inmates 
the chance to pay something back to the community said 
department of corrections spokeswoman christine may 
the inmates also benefit by developing an esprit de corps that 
theyve never had before except maybe in gangs said lt dm

white palestinian flag and praised nelson mandela after the african 
national congress leaders rally at tiger stadium 
anc plo fight apartheid dont let go odeh and friends 
chanted as the sellout crowd of 49000 left the stadium thursday 
night 
hundreds of propalestinians stood at their seats clenched 
fists thrust skyward in salute to mandela many carried posters of 
mandela embracing palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafat 
racial segregation in south africa and life in the 
israelioccupied territories are parallel oppressive situations 
said members of the detroitareas 250000 arabamerican community 
arabamericans worked alongside black leaders for mandelas 
17hour visit to detroit they sold and bought rally tickets 
picked youngsters to meet with mandelas wife winnie during a 
childrens reception and felt the same pride of recognition as 
detroits 750000 blacks 
arabamericans feel the fight in south africa is their 
fight said ismael ahmed director of the arab community center 
for economic and social services 
he could have just spoken about the african cause but hes 
upheld the struggle for palestine ahmed said six of every 10 
arabs here have lived here less than 10 years its not theory 
here apartheidlike activities are very real to these people 
mandela who was released in february after serving 27 years of 
a life sentence in south africa for sabotage never mentioned 
palestine during his detroit stop earlier during his us tour he 
praised arafat libyas moammar gadhafi and cuban leader fidel 
castro for their support of the african national congress 
those comments wiped none of the shine from mandelas detroit 
appearances as they had earlier thursday in miami 
mayors of the miami areas major cities refused to greet mandela 
upon his arrival at miami international airport about 300 
antimandela demonstrators mostly cubanamericans waved placards

mandela addressed union leaders 
ahmed said that while there are differences between the black 
and arab communities in detroit they have worked to overcome them 
in miami dade county commissioner charles dusseau said there is 
less tolerance between blacks and cubanamericans 
there is a lot of friction in miami because the cubans and the 
blacks are fighting for the same piece of the pie said terry 
ahwal a board member of the americanarab anti discrimination 
committee in dearborn 
though mandela never mentioned the snub he received in miami he 
praised the lovein detroit held for him 
i dont think we could have gotten a better reception than we 
did mandela said friday before departing for los angeles it 
has been warm and flattering in fact we could stay here and not

a chapter of a book published friday in a 
newspaper suggests prime minister yitzhak shamir wanted mordechai 
vanunu killed before the former nuclear technician could spill 
israels atomic secrets to the world 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner dismissed the report as pure 
gossip 
a chapter of the book threeway treason by american 
journalist louis toscano was printed friday by the daily newspaper 
maariv the book has not been published 
vanunu 36 a former technician at the dimona nuclear reactor 
is serving an 18year jail sentence for treason and espionage for 
his revelations which were published by the sunday times of london 
in 1986 
his case has been championed worldwide by human rights groups 
who consider him a hero for the antinuclear cause 
vanunus information suggested israel had stockpiled 100 nuclear 
weapons and could produce neutron and hydrogen bombs giving it 
the worlds sixthlargest nuclear arsenal israel has always 
declined to answer directly allegations of its nuclear capacity 
most of the proceedings against vanunu in israel have been 
shrouded in secrecy including details of how he was brought to 
israel for trial 
maariv and its editors noted that toscano who once worked in 
israel for the united press international news agency was denied 
interviews with vanunu and all the israeli leaders connected to the 
affair 
the newspaper said toscano based his story on discussions with 
sources in the united states england israel great britain italy 
and australia 
according to toscanos book israels secret mossad intelligence 
agency tracked vanunu in sydney australia before he sold his story 
to the british paper vanunu had moved to sydney after being laid 
off from the reactor in october 1985 while in australia he made 
contacts with journalists 
the book says israeli officials initially were skeptical about 
intelligence reports coming from sydney concerning vanunus 
contacts doubting he could do much damage because he had been only 
a lowlevel technician 
but after obtaining some of the photographs vanunu was trying to 
sell the mossad dispatched a sevenmember squad to follow him in 
australia the excerpt says 
the prime minister of israel at the time shimon peres of the 
leftofcenter labor party learned of vanunus attempts to sell 
information to the times in sydney in august 1986 the book says 
peres promptly convened with shamir then foreign minister and 
the defense minister yitzhak rabin to discuss the case it adds 
shamir was quoted as voicing dismay that vanunu had been allowed 
to work at the reactor despite his alleged past links with far 
leftwing groups 
peres is quoted as respondingbut lets concentrate on what we 
do now 
shamir is said to have shrugged and replied it is clear it 
isnt it and after a moment of silence peres said no we 
dont kill jews 
vanunu is a traitor shamir allegedly insisted and there 
is only one way to handle this type of person rabin is quoted as 
saying it was too late for such a solution 
the excerpt says the israeli leaders later decided to let 
vanunu tell his story to the world and take action later 
despite shamirs objections 
the excerpt indicates the decision may have been taken in view 
of an israeli intelligence report in 1985 that suggested israel 
should inform neighboring arab countries of its nuclear potential 
as a deterrent

a photograph of a nude father and son is 
pornographic say federal officials who seized the print and want 
to destroy it even though it has been widely exhibited and 
published as a work of art 
its not an obscene photograph not even close said robert 
e mittel a portland lawyer who is fighting to get the picture by 
photographer walter chappell out of the hands of authorities 
us attorney richard s cohen has a different view of the black 
and white print called father and son which was taken in the 
early 1960s and shows chappell in the nude with an erect penis as 
he holds his infant son 
im not an artist cohen said friday im generally very 
liberal on these things but i do personally find it quite 
offensive 
the signed picture of chappell who lives in el rito nm was 
seized this winter by us customs officials at the canadian border 
crossing in houlton 
two friends of the owner birgit lenderink were trying to take 
the picture from ms lenderinks old home in canada to her current 
home at a meditation center in vermont mittel would not say where 
his client lives because she does not want to be bothered by 
reporters 
once the picture was confiscated assistant us attorney 
jonathan chapman filed an action titled united states of america 
v one obscene photograph chapman is seeking permanent federal 
custody of the print so it can be destroyed 
the defendant is a mounted and framed photograph which is a 
lascivious exhibition of adult male genitals touching a young 
child says chapmans filing which calls the picture obscene 
and immoral 
at the museum of modern art in new york a curator of 
photography found the federal action disturbing 
this picture has been around for nearly 30 years peter 
galassi said by telephone in the photographic world its a 
picture thats been known for a long time along with other 
pictures by chappell its very surprising to see all of a sudden 
that the us government is upset by this picture 
the print has appeared in a coffeetable picture book of 
american nude photography published by harper amp row mittel and 
galassi said 
harper amp row does not publish pornography mittel said 
no court dates have been set cohens office has sent a copy of 
the photograph to the obscenity unit at the justice department to 
see what officials there think 
chappell did not immediately return a phone message that the 
associated press left on his home answering machine in el rito a 
farming community about 40 miles north of santa fe the artist did 
not want to discuss the controversy but might issue a statement in 
a few days said art dealer andrew smith who handles much of 
chappells work 
the case in maine comes as other issues of expression have 
stirred nationwide controversy including flag burning the lyrics 
of the rap group 2 live crew and the sexually explicit photographs 
of the late robert mapplethorpe mapplethorpes work often has been 
cited in the debate over proposed restrictions on the types of art 
that can receive federal funding 
proving the chappell picture is obscene might be difficult in 
maine where voters in 1986 rejected a statewide obscenity 
ordinance observers say 
its an interesting case in light of the other issues that are 
looming nationally in terms of censorship and other issues 
affecting art grants said dick dyer a maine arts commission 
spokesman who called chappell a legitimate artist 
he is a nationally recognized photographer dyer said the 
idea of obscene art is really an oxymoron if its art it cant be 
obscene

a physicians group went back to court friday 
seeking to block fatal government experiments on three monkeys 
seized in a 1981 raid on a maryland laboratory 
meanwhile spokesmen for a california congressman and the 
interim head of the national institutes of health said their bosses 
would meet july 10 to discuss the experiments 
the physicians committee for responsible medicine filed an 
appeal friday with the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia seeking review of a lower court judges 
denial of a temporary restraining order to halt the experiments 
the monkeys are being cared for at tulane universitys delta 
primate research center in covington la 
the physicians group has sued the national institutes of health 
alleging scientific fraud and misconduct involving the experiments 
on the monkeys 
the nih said it would conduct no further experiments on the 
monkeys until the appeals court rules it said until the 
experiments are conducted the animals will be allowed to live 
unless their conditions deteriorate to such an extent that the 
researchers ability to obtain accurate data would be compromised 
the three monkeys are among seven remaining animals seized from 
a silver spring md laboratory in 1981 they were part of a study 
of stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation financed by nih 
researchers had cut the sensory nerves to the left arms of the 
animals 
unable to feel pain the monkeys have bitten and otherwise 
injured their arms sometimes severely according to officials at 
tulane where the monkeys were moved in 1987 
researchers want to anesthetize the monkeys remove portions of 
their skulls and monitor their brain responses to certain 
activities the animals would be put to death while under 
anesthesia 
scientists want to learn whether the parts of the monkeys 
brains that ordinarily would sense feeling and movement in the arms 
have taken over other functions 
the july 10 meeting was scheduled for acting nih director dr 
william f raub and rep tom lantos dcalif to discuss the 
experiments spokesmen for both said neither knew specifics of the 
planned session

democratic party leaders on friday tied 
their hopes for reclaiming the white house in 1992 to a populist 
economic appeal and an effort to score significant gains in crucial 
state races this year 
democratic leaders admit such optimism may appear unfounded 
given president bushs record high popularity and the shortage of 
democratic presidential candidates 
yet the democratic state chairmen who are gathered in portland 
this weekend for a twoday conference maintained that issues are 
breaking in ways favorable to democrats the dearth of democratic 
presidential contenders could work to the partys favor in the long 
run they say 
the best news is we dont have people running around the 
country running for president said ohio democratic chairman 
james ruvolo president of the state chairs in 1990 the action 
is in the states its not in washington 
ruvolo said both parties hopes for 1992 and the entire decade 
rest with winning state and local elections that will decide who 
benefits from the postcensus redrawing of legislative and 
congressional districts 
victories in major redistricting battlegrounds the 
gubernatorial races in florida california texas and the midwest 
would give the party the local leaders and grassroots organizations 
needed to upset bush in two years he said 
how we do in 1990 is more important than whos running for 
president ruvolo said sounding a theme repeated by other state 
party leaders if we do our job in november the outlook for a 
democratic candidate in 1992 will be that much better 
the absence of declared democratic presidential candidates has 
left the job of shaping the partys message largely to the national 
party apparatus 
national party chairman ronald brown is using this weekends 
meeting to lay out an economic agenda he believes can get democrats 
out from under the tax and spend label pinned on the party 
during the 1980s 
its clear to me that were on a roll as a party brown told 
the state chairmen when you take two issues the cold war and 
taxes away from the republican party they dont have much to run 
on 
until clear candidates emerge brown is resting the partys 
hopes on a populist message blaming republicans for the burgeoning 
savings and loan crisis and other alleged mismanagement he says has 
been billed to low and middleincome voters 
we have decided to take the gloves off on that issue said 
brown he was dedicating a major speech saturday to shaping the 
democratic attack on the sampl issue 
the upbeat talk was tempered by the realization that bushs 
favorability ratings in polls surpass even those of reagan still a 
party pollster maintained that bushs support is wide but thin and 
that democrats could use the right economic message to break a 
dismal record in recent national campaigns 
many of the state chairmen said bushs reversal on taxes and 
growing public anger at the cost of the sampl bailout have given the 
democrats sudden hope for 1992 
bush is extremely vulnerable in 92 said paul goldman 
chairman of the virginia democratic party and a close adviser to 
gov douglas wilder a hot prospect for the national ticket in 1992 
or 1996 the credibility of the republican party on fiscal 
matters is rapidly eroding and the american people are taking 
notice

about 2000 victims of the 1984 bhopal 
gas disaster gathered near the home of prime minister vp singh on 
friday and demanded money and medical relief 
i want justice i want something 60yearold azghar ali 
cried feebly his voice lost in the crowds shouting 
the victims once again came from their central indian hometown 
to demand faster economic relief and medical aid to help them fight 
the debilitating effects of methyl isocynate gas 
the chemical leaked from a pesticide plant of union carbide 
corp in bhopal on dec 3 1984 killing more than 3000 people and 
injuring about 20000 others in the surrounding slums most of the 
victims were poor laborers 
ali a sign painter lived near the factory and was sleeping 
when the gas enveloped his shantytown 
today ali a bundle of bones and mottled skin cannot work 
because he cannot walk 100 yards without wheezing uncontrollably 
he lives in a tin shed survives on the charity of his neighbors 
and waits for government relief 
compensation suits against the usbased multinational have 
been held up for six years because of litigation in indian courts 
and changing government policies the victims have received only 
88 from the indian government that was distributed immediately 
after the disaster 
the government of rajiv gandhi singhs predecessor reached a 
supreme courtsupervised settlement with union carbide in february 
1989 and agreed to accept 470 million as compensation for the 
500000 claimants 
the government orginally sued union carbide for 3 billion 
several newspapers and political activists called the 1989 
settlement a sellout subsequent petitions in the supreme court 
delayed disbursement of the money 
singhs government which took office in december said it will 
challenge the 470 million settlement and reopen the case in an 
effort to pin criminal responsibility on union carbide criminal 
charges were withdrawn when the gandhi government accepted the 470 
million settlement from the company based in danbury conn 
on march 5 singhs government said it would pay interim 
compensation of 12 per month to each of about 500000 people 
living near the site of the gas leak the supreme court later asked 
the government to pay an additional 44 as monthly compensation to 
3110 totally disabled people 
but that has not helped ali yet 
the speed of disbursement is so slow that at the current pace 
it will take at least two years before all the victims start 
getting relief said abdul jabbar khan who organized the 
protesters train journey from bhopal 355 miles south of new delhi 
khan who has organized dozens of protest marches in bhopal and 
visits to new delhi said only 42000 beneficiaries have received 
money so far 
on friday khan convener of bhopal gas affected womens 
industrial group presented a memorandum at the prime ministers 
residence the marchers were stopped a halfmile away by a police 
barricade they camped on the road waiting for singhs reaction 
we just hope to get something from vp singh the rest is on 
allah said parveen jahan 25 whose only child died in infancy a 
few months after the gas leak 
she said she suffered a miscarriage a month ago because the gas 
has made me incapable of bearing children 
other women rushed to mrs jahan as she began sobbing silently 
her tears falling on crumpled medical records of her dead baby and 
of her miscarried fetus

a top government official said 
friday that a postapartheid political system might include two 
houses of parliament one elected directly and the other weighted 
in favor of minorities 
constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen told 
government television that a new constitution could have one 
chamber elected by a simple oneman onevote system 
a second chamber would give equal voting power to different 
groups even though the groups may be unequal in size viljoen told 
the south african broadcasting corp 
the second chamber could have veto power on major policy 
decisions viljoen said he did not say if the groups would be 
defined along racial lines or by other means 
viljoens comments on friday and a speech he delivered thursday 
night provided new details of the governments thinking as it 
prepares to negotiate a new constitution with black opposition 
groups 
those goals include 
equal voting rights for all citizens 
a bill of rights 
a strong independent judiciary with welldefined powers to 
uphold the constitution 
a system that does not allow minorities to paralyze the 
normal course of government 
viljoen said the whiteled government was not wedded to any 
particular constitutional model but he said any new system must 
prevent the 28million black majority from dominating minorities 
such as the 5 million whites and the countrys nearly 4 million 
mixedrace and asians 
experience worldwide has simply taught that proper recognition 
of minority interests in the context of heterogenous states is in 
the interest of all he said late thursday 
president fw de klerk has said that a simple oneperson 
onevote majorityrule system would replace white domination with 
black domination he wants a constitution that allows whites and 
blacks to share power 
however the african national congress and other leading 
antiapartheid groups want a oneperson onevote system with no 
special privileges set aside for whites or other minorities 
the government and the anc the largest opposition group held 
their first talks in may 
the anc says that before fullscale constitutional negotiations 
begin the government must allow an estimated 20000 anc exiles to 
return and also release from prison about 3000 activists convicted 
of politically motivated crimes 
under the current apartheid system whites control politics and 
the economy blacks have no voice in national affairs

the senate intelligence committee has voted to 
cut off covert us aid to the noncommunist alliance fighting 
cambodias vietnambacked regime government sources said friday 
the action first reported by the wall street journal reflects 
growing congressional concern that us support is at least 
indirectly helping the khmer rouge the strongest military force in 
the alliance and the party that was responsible for the slaughter 
of more than a million cambodians in the 1970s 
the committees move came during a closeddoor session on 
thursday to draft the central intelligence agencys budget for 
1991 the united states has for several years provided covert 
military aid to the resistance according to sources 
sen alan cranston dcalif said friday he hoped to begin a 
public debate over us policy toward cambodia by holding hearings 
in his foreign relations east asia subcommittee next month 
well be discussing the whole us policy toward cambodia and 
examine the lunacy of working with people allied with the khmer 
rouge cranston said in an interview i think we have a moral 
imperative to be more constructive than weve been 
but several sources said that support for the covert program is 
much stronger in the house than in the senate and that it may 
ultimately be preserved for another year 
a surprisingly strong majority of the house voted 260 to 162 on 
wednesday to continue a 7 millionayear program of overt 
nonlethal aid to the noncommunist resistance the covert military 
program is believed to be two to three times that size 
rep stephen solarz dny argued that it is in the us 
interest to sustain the elements of the resistance that are 
militarily weaker such as the faction led by prince norodom 
sihanouk which the united states supports 
and house foreign affairs committee chairman dante fascell 
dfla argued that it was useful to maintain even the figment 
that there is a political alternative to the khmer rouge available 
if peace talks can lead to elections 
the provision the house approved contains a directive that the 
overt aid be cut off to any group engaged in a pattern of 
military cooperation and coordination designed to assist the khmer 
rouge 
but intelligence sources said us information about what 
actually happens inside cambodia is sparse primarily depending on 
what can be learned through the military in thailand and through 
the members of asean the regional defense alliance

federal coordinators friday scrambled to 
keep on top of the wildfires in the west 
weve got a substantial level of activity but weve still got 
lots of resources ready to go boise interagency fire center 
spokesman arnold hartigan said 
the center is a joint effort of the us forest service bureau 
of land management national park service bureau of indian affairs 
and national weather service it monitors wildfire activity on 
public land nationwide and coordinates logistical support for 
firefighting efforts 
hartigan said about 7600 firefighters and 3000 support 
personnel worked on fire lines friday in california arizona 
colorado and western texas near the new mexico line they were 
battling blazes sparked by arsonists and some 49000 lightning 
strikes recorded throughout the west in the previous 24 hours 
hot dry conditions were hampering efforts but hartigan said a 
wetter than normal may delayed onset of the regions fire season 
and moist air moving into the southwest held the promise of relief 
for fire crews over the weekend 
were hoping for the start of the monsoon season in arizona 
and new mexico sometimes this weekend or next week but to the 
north that increases the chance of thunderstorms with dry 
lightning in colorado utah nevada and southwest wyoming he 
said 
hartigan said the fire season is expected to extend until 
october throughout most of the west but could last until november 
or even early december in southern california 
the major problem there is urban interface people building 
homes right in the trees and up into the brush and wildlands he 
said cedar and woodshake shingles also are a big problem and 
too many people still dont clear brush away from their homes

publicly imposed excommunication has become a 
rare penalty in roman catholicism but its considered automatic 
for those who unrepentantly obtain abortions 
sociological studies indicate it likely applies to hundreds of 
thousands of catholics in such circumstances 
it also has become a potentially explosive issue between bishops 
and politicians 
the penalty barring a church member from holy communion and 
benefits of other church rites and prayers were formally imposed 
this month on an abortion clinic director in corpus christi texas 
such individually specific punishment is seldom decreed in the 
church these days it certainly is not commonplace said sister 
sharon ewart a canon law expert of the us catholic conference in 
washington dc 
however there was a 1986 case in providence ri in which a 
planned parenthood director was publicly named as automatically 
excommunicated 
other cases may seem similar yet are different its a complex 
variously conditioned process 
last november san diego bishop leo maher barred from communion 
a prochoice state senate candidate lucy killea but ms killea 
who was subsequently elected wasnt excommunicated from other 
church involvement 
that also is the case for an estimated 5 million to 6 million 
divorced and remarried roman catholics those in that category had 
been automatically excommunicated until a change made in 1977 
at that time us bishops with approval of the late pope paul 
vi revoked an 1884 decree by the american bishops automatically 
excommunicating divorced remarried catholics 
although that no longer applies such catholics still are barred 
from communion unless they secure an annulment of previous 
marriages or some other pastoral resolution of their cases 
current church canon law no 1398 prescribes automatic 
excommunication of those who secure an abortion and do not 
afterward change their stance meaning that they repent and seek 
absolution 
another canon no 1329 provides for automatic excommunication 
of accomplices to abortion that is those who enable someone 
to obtain an abortion who could not have done so without their help 
that canon was applied in the corpus christi and providence 
cases and there is considerable debate over its implications in 
reference to politicians who uphold laws permitting abortion 
new yorks cardinal john oconnor touched off a recent furor in 
saying such politicians were skirting grounds for excommunication 
persons excommunicated remain baptized church members and 
except in certain severe cases traditionally invoked by the pope 
may continue to attend church and associate with other members 
the penalty can be lifted through confessional repentance and 
determination to change conduct

a french company announced plans friday to launch 
the soviet unions first instant lottery hoping the lure of 
big prizes will sell hundreds of millions of tickets for the 
benefit of a charity group 
the lottery is scheduled to begin by the end of july with an 
initial distribution of 200 million tickets said georgesrobert 
parisot president of the international section of the societe 
internationale des jeux the company that runs the french national 
lottery 
he said the tickets are to be sold in the soviet union by the 
soviet childrens fund which was established several years ago to 
look after the interests of children the fund is officially 
independent but has close ties to the government 
parisot told the associated press the biggest prizes in the 
instant lottery would be 25000 rubles equivalent to 42000 at 
the standard exchange rate or 4200 at the tourist exchange rate 
he said the tickets will sell for five rubles apiece 830 at 
the standard rate or 83 cents at the tourist rate 
although the first order is for 200 million tickets parisot 
said he expected billions would be sold in the soviet union which 
has a population of almost 300 million he said 57 percent of 
ticket sale proceeds would be paid back in prizes with the 
remainder going to the childrens fund and administrative costs 
the french company which will print the tickets and run the 
lottery will keep a percentage of the administrative costs 
there has been a longstanding lottery in the soviet union but 
the best prizes are often appliances or infrequently 
automobiles 
an accord signed by parisot and an official of the soviet 
childrens fund proposed the creation of a joint frenchsoviet 
company by march 1991 to expand lottery operations in the soviet 
union and to establish a facility for printing lottery tickets in 
the soviet union by 1993 
in an instant lottery a participant learns immediately whether 
he or she is a winner by scratching away a covering over part of 
the ticket in traditional lotteries the ticket purchaser must 
await some sort of drawing to determine if he or she has the lucky 
number

rasheeda moore testified under 
crossexamination friday she repeatedly steered marion barry onto 
the subject of drugs after the mayor said he did not want to use 
cocaine the night he was arrested in an fbi sting operation 
moore denied a suggestion by barrys lawyer that she trapped the 
mayor in the sting operation or that her motive for working with 
the fbi was because barry had abandoned her for another woman 
moore broke the fbis instructions and tried to persuade the 
mayor to use drugs she admitted under a second day of questioning 
by defense attorney r kenneth mundy 
midway through the fbi videotape of the sting operation moore 
asks the mayor if he wants to use drugs 
no not tonight barry replies on the tape but moore brings 
the subject back to drugs repeatedly after that 
you felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade 
influence coerce or beguile barry into using drugs asked mundy 
i did said moore 
why did you do that asked mundy 
moore said she got overcarried in performing her duties for 
the fbi that night 
in your zeal to get mr barry mundy said accusingly for 
all you knew he had been off drugs since may 1989 when moore 
went to california 
not in my zeal insisted moore i was not out to get mr 
barry 
what was your intent asked mundy 
working this operation with the fbi replied moore 
mundy suggested moore had been badly treated by the mayor 
was she angry at mr barry because he didnt return her calls 
throughout an eightmonth span in 1989 mundy asked no moore said 
was she angry because the mayor was involved with another woman 
maria mccarthy or because barry had slapped moore when they broke 
up their romantic relationship asked mundy 
no she wasnt moore insisted each time 
on the videotape barry tells moore at one point that maria 
is interested in having sex with the mayor 
walking up to the witness stand mundy stood next to the former 
model and showed her a segment of the transcript of the recorded 
conversation during the vista sting 
the former model inexplicably shouts oh maria maria just 
before fbi agents and police detective crash into moores hotel 
room to arrest barry for cocaine possession 
if there was no vengeance on your mind why would moore say 
such a thing inquired mundy 
i have no idea responded moore suggesting it was out of 
nervousness 
had moore been scorned a reporter asked mundy after the days 
court session 
mundy agreed immediately and quoted the old proverb hell hath 
no fury like a woman scorned 
moore insisted that barry repeatedly used code language about 
drugs in carrying on their conversation and she said he acted on 
his own in buying crack cocaine from an undercover fbi agent and 
smoking it 
he was comfortable he was being himself during the visit 
she said 
moore the governments star witness in barrys drug and perjury 
trial testified previously that she and the mayor used drugs 
together over 100 times and had an intimate relationship from 
shortly after their 1986 meeting until mid1988 
the jury spent much of thursday watching a videotape showing 
barry arriving at moores hotel room last jan 18 eventually 
smoking the drug and being arrested 
mundy is pursuing an entrapment defense contending the mayor 
was illegally lured to the downtown washington hotel room that 
exmodel moore was staying in as part of her cooperation with 
federal authorities 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use one of 
the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation 
at the vista hotel 
during the day us district judge thomas penfield jackson 
barred the rev george augustus stallings from attending the trial 
stallings a barry supporter broke with the vatican by starting 
his own africanamerican catholic church saying rome has not been 
serving the needs of black catholics 
mundy and the american civil liberties union asked the us 
circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia to overturn 
jacksons exclusion of stallings and his thursday order turning 
away nation of islam leader louis farrakhan 
jackson said the presence of stallings or farrakhan could be 
disruptive

hazardous but added

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday he 
hoped his latest letter to president bush on the peace process 
would open a new chapter for the middle east an aide to shamir 
said 
the letter is viewed in israel as the rightwing governments 
first formal acceptance of certain proposals by secretary of state 
james a baker iii aimed at holding israelipalestinian peace talks 
in cairo 
sources in the bush administration said officials are taking a 
close look at shamirs letter and may set up a meeting between 
baker and israeli foreign minister david levy 
at issue is the future of the 17 million palestinians living in 
the west bank and gaza strip that israel captured in the 1967 
middle east war 
shamir sent the letter in response to one from president bush 
inquiring about the prime ministers intentions now that he has 
formed a new government the last israeli government headed by 
shamir collapsed in march in disagreement over whether to approve 
bakers formula for israelipalestinian talks 
israel has proposed holding elections for palestinians to select 
negotiators for an interim peace settlement of limited selfrule 
bakers proposals were raised last year as a way to start 
implementation of the plan but negotiations became mired in 
israels objection to talks with the palestine liberation 
organization which israel considers a terrorist organization and 
palestinians consider their legitimate representative 
pazner said shamirs very lengthy sevenpage document to 
bush this week proposed a new method for choosing palestinian 
negotiators acceptable to israel 
shamir wrote that every palestinian living in the territories 
can take part in a palestinian delegation on a namebyname 
basis pazner said 
that formula is seen as a possible way to sidestep israels 
objections to speaking with representatives of the plo and israels 
refusal to allow representation for east jerusalem arabs 
east jerusalem was captured along with the west bank during the 
1967 war israel annexed east jerusalem and declared an undivided 
jerusalem its eternal capital 
shamirs proposal would apparently permit the inclusion of 
palestinians who are formally registered as residents of the west 
bank or gaza strip but who also maintain residence in jerusalem 
mr shamir expressed today his hope that his letter and the 
forthcoming answers and reactions from the united states will open 
a new chapter in the peace process in the middle east and will 
make possible further contacts in order to move things forward 
pazner said 
earlier friday levy shamirs leading rival in the rightwing 
likud bloc took a tougher stance toward the united states 
accusing washington of trying to dictate middle east policies to 
israel 
we really want a friendship with the us but we will not 
overlook the potential dangers we face he said in an interview 
with the yediot ahronot daily newspaper 
we will not be good children and will not agree to let them 
dictate to us what to do with our lives and remind us that we are 
small and dependent said levy 
asked whether the annual 3 billion in us aid influenced 
american attitudes toward israel levy said he feared americans had 
forgotten israel was a valuable ally and begun to think of it as 
a parasite

goons out 
michener the author of centennial told about 100 people on 
thursday the state needs to resist the temptation to corrupt its 
natural resources and prevent incursions on yellowstone or grand 
teton national parks 
michener who spent some time in wyoming in the 1970s 
researching centennial said steps are needed to preserve the 
states natural beauty one of his suggestions was buying a ranch 
and preserving it so children in 50 years will be able to see what 
ranch life was like 
i said a few years ago i would build a wall around wyoming to 
keep the goons out he said i guess i still think that 
michener 83 was in wyoming at the invitation of its first 
lady jane sullivan to help the state celebrate its centennial 
we should keep this as a treasurehouse for the rest of the 
country he said 
wyoming will become increasingly popular as a haven from the 
accelerating pace of life michener said

cabinet ministers from at least 12 countries pointing to recent 
scientific studies on the speed in which the ozone layer is being 
destroyed urged a ban on halons and chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
by 1997 
the united states japan and the soviet union insisted the 
deadline for such a ban be the year 2000 delaying the ban for 
three years would allow the release of 11 billion more tons of 
chemicals into the stratosphere environmentalists said 
the 1987 protocol had called for a 50 percent cut in the 
chemicals by 2000 
like that protocol fridays actions have no penalties for 
violations and no enforcement powers 
the new treaty bans chcs by that year and increases the list of 
controlled chemicals from eight to 20 
we believe it is necessary and possible to do better than this 
timetable said west german environment minister klaus topfer 
unfortunately three countries refused to go along 
william reilly administrator for the us environmental 
protection agency said he was pleased with agreement 
i think it was a very successful conference he said when 
the treaty parties meet again in 1992 they will see if a case can 
be made for accelerating the schedule he said 
the conference agreed to a phaseout schedule that would cut 
cfcs by 20 percent in 1993 and 50 percent in 1995 before the final 
ban the 30page amendment to the montreal protocol also banned 
carbon tetrachloride by the end of the century and eliminated 
methyl chloroform by 2005 
in another move the conference approved an unprecedented 240 
million fund to assist developing nations build industries that do 
not rely on chemicals that deplete the ozone 
the fund sponsored by developed nations is seen by many as a 
model for solving other more costly environmental problems 
china and india will each receive 40 million over the next 
three years after they sign the protocol which they have said they 
will do bringing those two populous countries into the treaty was 
considered vital 
the fund will be controlled by an executive committee made up of 
developing and industrialized nations that will each serve 
threeyear terms 
cfcs used in refrigeration insulation cleaning solvents and 
as aerosol propellents rise into the stratosphere where they break 
down in constituent chemical parts one of these chlorine 
destroys the thin shield of ozone that filters out harmful 
ultraviolet rays and helps preserve the earths flora 
about 100 countries attended the twoweek conference only the 
56 parties to the montreal protocol were allowed to vote on the 
agreement 
the conference was seen as a precursor to more difficult 
negotiations that will take place soon on global warming and 
reducing the use of fossil fuels

nasa is grounding its three space shuttles 
until engineers can find and fix a hydrogen leak that has now been 
detected in two of the winged spacecraft the agency announced 
friday 
engineers conducting a test loading of hydrogen rocket fuel into 
the propellant tank of space shuttle atlantis found the second leak 
early friday morning a similar leak found on columbia last month 
forced postponement of its astronomy mission 
nasa spaceflight chief bill lenoir said atlantis which had been 
scheduled for launch in midjuly now will be rolled back to the 
hangar so engineers can remove its fuel tank and try to locate the 
leak 
columbias leak also was found while it was on the launch pad 
just six hours before its scheduled may 30 liftoff it too was 
rolled back to the hangar 
lenoir said the agency had no choice but to keep the space 
shuttle fleet on the ground until the problem is fixed he 
designated leonard nicholson deputy director of the space shuttle 
program at nasa headquarters in washington to take charge of the 
leak investigation 
we cant fly until we can get hydrogen into the tank and were 
not going to put hydrogen in the tank until we can do it safely and 
weve got a problem getting over that hump right now lenoir said 
in a news conference at the kennedy space center in florida 
lenoir said he would hesitate to use the word grounded in 
reference to the shuttle fleet but he added theres no question 
that we wont fly until we understand it the leak have it fixed 
have tested it verified it and were ready 
the nasa executive said that the leak problem could be resolved 
in two weeks but that it could take longer if engineers determine 
a new design is needed for what is called the umbilical of the 
space shuttle this is an assembly of pipes and valves that directs 
the flow of propellants into the tank from a ground supply and at 
launch from the tank to the shuttle engines 
crews drained liquid hydrogen from the shuttle tanks and left 
them open to evaporate any remaining hydrogen before a purge with 
inert helium to carry away any remnant 
the vertical service structure was to be wrapped around the 
shuttle on saturday pending further work on monday 
nasa launched space shuttle missions in february and april and 
was planning for six more this year atlantis midjuly mission was 
to be a secret military flight columbias mission in may was to be 
a 10day flight with a cargo of astronomical instruments that 
mission was postponed until august other flights had been set for 
august october november and december 
but the hydrogen leak problem already was causing a reshuffling 
of the schedule and some missions seem certain to slip into next 
year 
lenoir said the first priority is correcting the leak to assure 
the safety of the space shuttles 
if that costs us a flight im sorry he said 
even as engineers were searching for the shuttle leak other 
nasa officials were being grilled in a senate hearing about the 
focusing flaw discovered this week in the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope 
sen al gore dtenn suggested at the hearings that nasa had 
not maintained a good system of quality control and was more 
interested in getting funds for new projects than efficiently 
completing projects already underway 
nasas eyes are bigger than its stomach gore charged 
on the hubble problem the senator noted we have been assured 
now for 12 years that everything was all right we owe it to the 
taxpayers to find out what went wrong how to fix it and make sure 
it never happens again 
in florida lenoir said that because the hydrogen leaks on 
columbia and atlantis occurred while the vehicles were being fueled 
on the launch pad it seems likely that these are related and of 
a similar class 
this puts into question the safety of the umbilical system on 
discovery the third shuttle 
discovery is scheduled to carry a science spacecraft called 
ulysses into orbit in october a delay in that mission could cause 
the craft to not be launched for years because its success depends 
upon the alignment of other planets ulysses is scheduled to go 
into a polar orbit of the sun 
robert crippen chief of the shuttle office at nasa said the 
leaks are coming from umbilical parts that have proven reliable 
through 31 shuttle flights liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are 
the propellants used in the space shuttles main rocket engines

in a rare show of unity quebecs premier and a 
provincial opposition leader agreed friday to establish a 
nonpartisan parliamentary commission to map out quebecs political 
future 
at a crucial time in its history quebec is united premier 
robert bourassa said following a 90minute meeting with the head of 
parti quebecois jacques parizeau 
the meeting was in response to the defeat of the meech lake 
accord which would have designated quebec a distinct society 
all 10 provinces and the federal government had to ratify the 
constitutional amendment by saturday midnight but newfoundland 
suspended debate on the issue and the accord expired 
the accord was an attempt to gain frenchspeaking quebecs 
signature on canadas 1982 constitution it had little practical 
impact but became a symbol of enormous importance to the 65 
million quebecois who make up onefourth of canadas population 
what we have done is an important first step in defining what 
quebec wants not as far as the rest of canada is concerned but 
what quebec wants as far as quebec is concerned said parizeau 
the parliamentary commission will be composed of representatives 
of labor business universities municipalities and members of 
political parties 
the leaders of the two parties will meet with their caucuses 
july 10 to set guidelines for the commission which will travel 
around the province to sound the opinions of quebecois on a variety 
of issues that include some quebecers desire to secede from canada 
the leaders said they hoped the commission would begin work this 
fall and produce a nonbinding report by the end of the year 
both leaders said it would be up to bourassa to use the 
commissions recommendations as a basis for a referendum an 
election or as a bargaining chip to resume negotiations with the 
federal government over possibly reconsideration of a special 
status for quebec within canadas federation

rebels in battles friday and the bodies of 14 policemen were 
discovered in a mass grave military officials said 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said two 
soldiers were also killed in the renewed round of fighting in sri 
lankas sevenyearold civil war which has engulfed the island 
nations north and east where the ethnic tamil minority 
predominates 
the latest deaths raise to 1764 the number of combatants killed 
since fighting between tamil guerrillas and government forces

been manhandled by sinhalese police 
at least 850 policemen were captured by the tamil tiger rebels 
officials have said at least 330 of the policemen have been 
killed and the fate of the others is unknown 
government forces launched an offensive after the police 
stations were captured forcing the rebels to retreat into the 
jungles and swamps in the east military officials believe the 
tigers retreat may be a tactical move to launch a protracted 
guerrilla war 
in the north at least 13 rebels and two soldiers were killed in 
a gunbattle in the district of vavuniya the officials said 
fighting also continued around jaffna fort an army installation 
in the heart of rebel territory the officials said 
at least 225 policemen and soldiers have been holed up in the 
fort since the fighting started 
loss of the fort would be a major blow to the government which 
now has only four military installations in the north under its 
control 
in the east authorities clamped a curfew on batticaloa and 
began housetohouse searches for rebels residents said 
a tamil doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
soldiers ordered all males aged 12 to 50 to report to military 
officials in the predominantly tamil town once a rebel stronghold 
while thousands of men gathered at schools churches mosques 
and temples the soldiers conducted housetohouse searches said 
another resident who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
the sri lankan army and police are dominated by sinhalese whom 
the tamils accuse of discrimination 
ethnic sinhalese who are mostly buddhists comprise 75 percent 
of the population while the predominantly hindu tamils comprise 18 
percent of the country 
at least 12700 people have been killed since the rebels took up 
arms in 1983

some 250000 pregnant women and infants can 
remain on a federal nutrition program aimed at giving a healthy 
start in life for babies from poor homes under a bill approved on 
friday by the senate 
this is about children said rep tony hall dohio 
chairman of the house select committee on hunger every dollar we 
spend on the wic program saves 3 later in health care costs 
the senate voice vote after midnight followed house approval of 
a bill to boost from 1 percent to 3 percent the amount states can 
borrow against next years allocation for the special supplemental 
feeding program or women infants and children known as wic that 
sends the bill to the president 
the 3 percent borrowing capacity would infuse 66 million into 
the program which provides food or vouchers that can be used to 
buy food at local stores 
the states administer the program using federal funds but 
unexpectedly high food prices absorbed so much of the 21 billion 
appropriated nationwide for this year that some states started 
cutting all but the most desperate participants from the program 
the national association of wic directors said earlier this week 
that 250000 women and children would be eliminated by the end of 
the fiscal year sept 30 if 72 million were not added to this 
years appropriation 
this is probably the most important bill weve passed in the 
last few months because it directly goes to feeding women and 
children and it directly helps people who need help said hall 
about 45 million women and children are enrolled in the 
program hall said thats only half the number that could be 
getting help under the laws eligibilty requirements if the 
government were willing to provide the money 
sen patrick leahy dvt sponsor of the senate bill said wic 
is universally acclaimed as one of our nations most successful 
nutrition programs

police used a sledgehammer to break into 
the agriculture ministry on friday and ended a 3dayold sitin by 
hundreds of farmers demanding guaranteed prices for their products 
officers broke open a locked ministry door shortly before 730 
pm scores of police carrying truncheons then entered the building 
in central warsaw 
several hundred farmers walking in a peaceful procession came 
out about a halfhour after police entered they carried a protest 
banner and were singing the patrioticreligious hymn rota and 
the national anthem 
a few demonstrators had to be pulled out but police said in 
general they did not encounter resistance they said there were no 
arrests or injuries 
the protesters later marched about a halfmile to a statue of 
preworld war ii peasant leader wincenty witos before dispersing 
the government said in a communique that it resorted to force 
only after efforts to persuade the farmers to leave of their own 
volition failed 
earlier in the day the estimated 600 protesters agreed to allow 
ministry employees to enter the building but the government 
steadfastly refused to negotiate with the farmers as long as they 
remained inside 
this form of protest is violating elementary principles of 
order in the country a government communique said 
the farmers are demanding minimum price guarantees for their 
products as shelter from the governments economic reform program 
which is turning polands centrally controlled socialist economy 
into a marketdriven system they occupied the government wednesday 
after a march through warsaw and closed the building to employees 
thursday 
agricultural minister czeslaw janicki and his deputies were 
permitted inside friday morning as the workers waited outside two 
dozen police vehicles then surrounded the building 
the farmers who clustered in several ministry conference rooms 
said they would not conduct talks until the police were removed 
but they appeared divided over whether to agree to admit the 
workers and reversed their decision several times before allowing 
them in at midafternoon 
curious spectators sometimes breaking into debate waited 
outside the entrance to the blocksquare ministry signs hung 
outside proclaimed there is no freedom without justice and 
we will never abandon the soil of our roots 
solidarity leader lech walesa returned to poland from vienna on 
friday and said he would be available if asked to help resolve the 
conflict 
the solidarity leaders personal appeal won suspensions of two 
other challenges to the reform program a strike by railway 
workers that disrupted transport across northwest poland in may 
and a blockade of the main warsawgdansk highway by dairy farmers 
in midjune 
the economic reform program cut most subsidies lifted price 
controls let interest rates rise to reflect the level of 
inflation and opened the economy to private ventures 
it has led to price increases of up to 1000 percent in a year 
leading to a drop in consumption there is also a glut of food 
donations from western nations which rushed to offer support to 
the new solidarityled government 
nearly half of polands 25 million private farms are plots of 
about 12 acres or less and farmers say they have neither the time 
nor the transport to seek competitive markets for their products 
polands leaders have repeatedly refused demands for special 
treatment by various sectors of the economy saying that yielding 
once would produce a torrent of requests from other groups 
the government compares demands for minimum farm prices to the 
system of subsidies that the communist regime used to pay farmers 
and keep consumer prices well below the actual cost of production

president bush said friday he knew he would be 
skewered for flipflopping on tax increases but comparing himself 
to abraham lincoln declared im thinking anew for the good of 
the country 
bush said he had changed course on the politically explosive 
issue to break a deadlock in deficitreduction talks with the 
democraticcontrolled congress 
look i knew id catch some flak on this decision said 
bush who has been harshly criticized by many republicans for 
abandoning the readmylips nonewtaxes slogan that helped 
him win the presidency 
ive got to do what i think is right and then ill ask the 
people for support bush said 
justifying his change the president said the economy was slower 
and the deficit now was worse than any of us visualized when he 
made his pledge two years ago 
however the congressional budget office estimated in march 1988 
that the fiscal 1991 deficit would be 159 billion very close to 
what the administration now says is the case 
bush made his comments at a news conference before departing for 
a long holiday weekend at kennebunkport maine and trips to london 
and houston for two summit meetings with western allies 
his last piece of business was to veto landmark legislation 
guaranteeing workers up to 12 weeks of annual unpaid leave for 
childbirth adoption or family illness 
i strongly object to the federal government mandating 
leave policies for americas employers and work force bush said 
questions about his reversal on taxes dominated bushs news 
conference but he also emphasized his opposition to giving cash 
aid to moscow to bail out the sickly soviet economy 
it is hard for the american people to say why put xbillions 
of dollars of money into the soviet economy when its not reformed 
when theyre spending 18 percent of their gross national product on 
military and when theyre spending an estimated 5 billion in 
cuba bush said 
some of our allies might not be as concerned about that last 
point as we are bush added 
he also said he was reviewing a letter from israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir proposing severe restrictions on which 
palestinians jerusalem would negotiate with 
im concerned about a deadlock in the peace process he 
said theres got to be discussion with the palestinians 
bush suspended an 18monthold dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization last week until the plo condemns a failed 
terrorist raid on an israeli beach 
bush also made a determined defense of his son neil the target 
of a conflictofinterest investigation by federal regulators in 
the collapse of a colorado savings and loan 
i have what dad wouldnt full confidence in the integrity 
and honor of my son and i will stay out of anything to do with the 
investigation but this is a fine young man the president said 
while many republicans roasted bush for his decision on taxes 
democrats hailed him as a statesman 
hes starting to act like a president rep daniel 
rostenkowski dill and chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said after bushs news conference 
sen jim sasser dtenn and chairman of the senate budget 
committee objected to bush comparing himself with lincoln 
that would be an overstatement in my judgment sasser said 
bush was asked by reporters if his reversal on taxes would 
damage his credibility 
no not in the long run bush said 
acknowledging the heat he has taken for his decision bush said 
i think that the arrows have been flying front back sideways 
but thats what i get paid for 
weve got a very important national problem and i think the 
president owes the people his judgment at the moment he has to 
address that problem bush said and thats exactly what im 
trying to do 
in light of his change bush said he could understand why voters 
might charge that he had never intended to keep his nonewtaxes 
promises 
i think its wrong but i can understand it im presented with 
new facts 
im doing like lincoln did think anew and im thinking 
anew he said 
bush did not elaborate on his reference to lincoln but was 
apparently referring to lincolns second message to congress on 
dec 1 1862 one month before the emancipation proclamation took 
effect 
emphasizing the need to free the slaves and keep the union 
intact lincoln said as our case is new so we must think anew 
and act anew and then we shall save our country 
bush also likened himself to former president reagan who after 
winning major tax cuts in 1981 had to go back to congress the next 
year for the largest tax increases ever he said reagan did what 
was right and so i think that were on the right track 
if i had control of this congress both houses we might not 
even be talking about this today he said 
without a deficitreduction agreement bush said automatic 
spending cuts totaling 100 billion could take effect oct 1 with 
draconian reductions in defense and domestic programs such as 
student loans 
bushs declaration earlier this week that tax revenue 
increases were an essential element of any deficitreduction 
package was an important impetus for the budget negotiations with 
congress 
the negotiators met again friday and searched for savings in 
pentagon spending but reached no agreements 
the presidents statement directly contradicted his 1988 speech 
in accepting the republican presidential nomination bush said then 
and im the one who will not raise taxes my opponent 
wont rule out raising taxes but i will 
and the congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no 
and theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again and ill 
say to them read my lips no new taxes

it has taken william finn nearly a decade to 
complete his musical trilogy about marvin a sexual sad sack who 
when we last saw him nine years ago had left an angry wife and a 
confused young son for a male lover 
but judging from the show that has found its way onto the tiny 
stage of offbroadways playwrights horizons the wait has been 
worth it the new 80minute musical which opened thursday is 
called falsettoland and its a compelling hugely entertaining 
piece of contemporary musical theater directed with energy and wit 
by james lapine 
but falsettoland is something more too darker and deeper 
than in trousers and march of the falsettos the first two 
marvin musicals this final installment of finns tale about modern 
manhattan life deals among other things with death and more 
specifically aids and finn with the help of the everresourceful 
lapine has pulled off the balancing act between satire and 
seriousness brilliantly 
the characters are much the same group finn brought to life in 
march of the falsettos 
the musical begins in 1981 where march of the falsettos 
ended theres marvin still as indecisive as ever equivocating 
over his relationship with whizzer that lover of yesteryear 
theres trina marvins embittered exwife and their son jason 
who has problems trying to accept his fathers sexual preferences 
and theres mendel marvins psychiatrist a man who had eventually 
married trina in march of the falsettos talk about confusing 
relationships 
finn has added two more characters marvins nextdoor 
neighbors two lesbians one is a doctor the other a caterer of 
kosher cuisine both occupations it turns out of increasing 
importance as the plot unfolds 
the story revolves around jasons bar mitzvah or rather his 
unwillingness to have a bar mitzvah and his parents squabbling 
over the celebration intertwined with their arguments is whizzers 
illness a fact finn faces unflinchingly 
as in the other two musicals marvin stands at the center of 
falsettoland in march of the falsettos marvin grew up 
or at least tried to in falsettoland he goes a step further 
accepting life and death his philosophy is anchored in one of 
finns more poignant lyrics we laugh we fumble we take it day 
by day what more can i say 
it turns out finn has a lot to say and some of it is very 
funny he has captured perfectly the frenzied selfcentered 
neuroses of new yorkers at work and play 
and without being didactic he deftly condenses as well as 
personalizes the history of aids in new york there are somber 
moments in the musical but they are never ponderous 
finns gift for melody overflows enhanced by michael starobins 
evocative orchestrations the composer jams some 17 numbers into 
the short musical which is mostly all sung finns lyrics are 
appropriate too sometimes surprisingly simple but affecting and 
at other times sassy and sophisticated 
as marvin michael rupert who also appeared in march of the 
falsettos turns nebbish into charming not an easy task 
ruperts marvin is a sympathetic appealing character instead of 
just a nerd 
faith prince handles the role of the exasperated exwife with 
skill a woman who could come off as the villain of the musical 
but instead earns our admiration as someone trying to keep sane 
while the rules keep changing 
chip zien as the psychiatrist serves as the evenings voice of 
reason and common sense he actually is the one person attuned to 
everyones problems stephen bogardus who has the shows best 
voice is fine as whizzer and danny gerard is surprisingly 
unaffected as the troubled but precocious jason heather macrae 
and janet metz offer distinctive portrayals as the solicitous 
nextdoor neighbors 
playwrights horizons long a champion of new plays is on 
something of a roll with musicals its last production once on 
this island was the best musical of last season that show moves 
to broadway next october and stephen sondheims new musical 
assassins opens at playwrights in november meanwhile its 
audiences will have much to savor in finns fascinating

allegations that a washington official ordered a delay in the 
seizure of the sampl thrift office spokesman william fulwider said 
at a white house news conference bush said he had full 
confidence in the integrity and honor of his 34yearold son he 
sympathized with his predicament describing him as probably the 
most sensitive of the four boys maybe the secondmost sensitive 
its not been easy for him but hes a good kid hes 
held his head up the president said 
at the same time bush promised not to interfere with 
regulators who are examining conflictofinterest allegations 
concerning the younger bush neil bush served on the board of 
directors of silverado banking savings and loan association of 
denver from 1985 to 1988 
the institution which collapsed at a cost of 1 billion to 
taxpayers made loans which were not repaid to several of neil

silverado he did not say who made the call the thrift was seized 
in december 1988 after the november presidential election

cost of the sampl crisis as a key reason for his willingness to 
accept a tax increase as part of a deficit reduction package in 
fiscal 1991

will so state if he hasnt i hope its fair enough to say hey 
the boy did nothing wrong bush said the system is going 
to work whether its the presidents son or somebody else

a federal appeals court on friday allowed an 
imprisoned member of the irish republican army to reapply for 
asylum in the united states to avoid deportation to northern 
ireland 
joseph doherty 35 has been imprisoned in new york for seven 
years he faces a life sentence in northern ireland for the 1980 
slaying of a british army officer and for a prison escape 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals overturned a june 1989 
ruling by us attorney general dick thornburgh denying doherty an 
asylum hearing 
the decision gives doherty the chance to try to prove his crimes 
were political that he faces severe persecution in northern 
ireland and should be granted refuge in the united states 
he is entitled to a hearing on his claim for political asylum 
and he may well be entitled to political asylum said dohertys 
attorney mary pike mr doherty is not going anywhere anytime 
soon certainly not to the united kingdom 
deborah corley a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office in 
new york said the government was reviewing the decision and had no 
immediate comment 
immigration laws allow political asylum if a foreigner can 
demonstrate a wellfounded fear of persecution on political 
religious racial or social grounds 
withholding deportation a separate action from asylum is 
mandatory if a person can show his life would be threatened in the 
other country 
doherty fled to new york in 1982 after several years on the run 
in ireland he was arrested by the fbi in 1983 and the british 
government requested his extradition 
a federal judge barred extradition in 1984 because dohertys 
crimes were political doherty has admitted that he took part in 
killing the army officer but said he did so for political reasons 
doherty has won decisions before two federal appeals courts two 
federal judges an immigration judge and three immigration appeals 
courts 
but the immigration court decisions were overturned by 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii and thornburgh 
the appeals court said the justice department intervention 
apparently was the first on grounds that asylum or deportation 
would endanger us foreign policy interests 
the threemember appeals court ruled that thornburgh exceeded 
his discretion in denying dohertys claim to asylum 
doherty in september 1986 asked to be deported to the republic 
of ireland where he faced a 10year prison sentence rather than 
life in prison in northern ireland the request was granted by a 
us immigration judge and upheld by an immigration appeals board 
despite objections by the justice department 
but meese in december 1988 overturned the request to be deported 
to ireland the federal board of immigration appeals subsequently 
allowed doherty to apply for asylum but not to change his 
designated country for deportation 
the appeals court friday also upheld meeses action but that 
ruling has less impact since doherty withdrew his request to be 
deported to ireland in 1986

the crazy horse saloon pariss most celebrated 
striptease nightclub seems an unlikely venue for a fashion show 
but its first parade of swimwear and bodystockings was a hot 
success 
the styles may not set the fashion world on fire but the 
strippers won over the audience when they showed off the new 
crazy horse line tuesday night to the beat of countryrock 
music 
on display were 38 bathing suits and bodies as the french 
call bodystockings by nicole olivier a lyonbased lingerie 
manufacturing firm 
strippers with stage names such as akie masterpiece and vanity 
obelisk modeled revealing swimsuits including one monokini 
baring the bosom others were decorated with sequins and 
ballfringes had daring cutouts or trailed suggestive metal 
tails 
nicole olivier formerly known for lingerie has 300 outlets 
throughout the world according to spokeswoman arlette colomb 
then our marketing department came up with this crazy horse 
idea to boost our sales said ms colomb so we set up a 
franchise with the nightclub 
one of the worlds most famous nude cabarets the crazy horse 
has built a reputation for highclass entertainment during 39 years 
of existence 
im delighted with the swimsuits and the association said 
crazy horse owner alain bernardin who founded the club in 1951 on 
the posh avenue george v 
the original was truly saloonstyle recalled bernardin he 
also garnered ideas from a visit to canada where he heard about an 
indian called crazy horse and admired spiffy redcoated royal 
canadian mounted police genial mounties still preside at the 
crazy horse front door 
bernardin gradually increased his showbiz techniques with 
sophisticated lighting attractive women and top choreographers 
and lured dancers from the paris opera to prance on his stage 
by the mid1970s the show was so popular that bernardin 
converted the saloon into a conventional theater with red carpeting 
and comfortable seats 
we like to consider our show a form of art said bernardin 
who recently married one of his former star dancers lova moor 
commercially the crazy horse is far from crazy last year it 
sold 225000 tickets ranging in price from about 75 to 120 or 
more depending on seating and choice of drinks 
the crazy horse sells tshirts and other souvenirs and now the 
risque new swimwear can be bought in stores around the world at 
about 120 a suit or bodystocking

chinas most famous dissident fang lizhi 
likely will move to the united states after a transition period in 
england to appease chinese authorities us officials said friday 
the officials also said chinas decision to let fang and his 
wife leave the country after a yearlong standoff reflects a 
victory for moderates within chinas leadership 
fang was allowed to leave china last sunday after spending one 
year as a fugitive with his wife at the us embassy in beijing he 
went to england where he will be a visiting fellow at cambridge 
university 
us officials have declined to discuss any detail of the 
agreement they helped arrange between fang and chinese authorities 
for the astrophysicists departure fangs decision to go to 
england was his own and there was no pressure on him to choose 
england over the united states said one official 
but the official speaking on condition he not be named said 
fangs choice of england likely made it easier for the chinese 
to let fang go given the enmity they felt toward the united 
states for granting refuge to the fangs 
meanwhile it was learned that richard nixon twice pressed 
chinese leader deng xiaoping last october and in april to release 
fang as a gesture of goodwill according to documents made 
available to the associated press on friday 
fang was wanted by chinese authorities in connection with his 
alleged role in fomenting prodemocracy demonstrations last year 
that culminated in a sweeping crackdown which left thousands dead 
or imprisoned 
the physicists son fang zhe will be leaving china within days 
to come to the united states said the official fang apparently 
insisted on assurances that his son an undergraduate at beijing 
university be allowed to leave the country 
fangs other son is a student at wayne state university in 
detroit 
fang has a sixmonth permit to stay in england which could be 
extended if he wished the us official said 
but fang will probably feel more comfortable here with two 
sons in the united states and the many friends he has here said 
the official 
us officials say they see some evidence that the decision to 
let fang leave was the result of a struggle within chinas 
leadership which was won by more moderate officials 
hardliners within the leadership had argued that sanctions by 
japan and the west to protest the chinese crackdown would soon be 
lifted and would not affect the countrys economy said one us 
official 
the hardliners position appears to have been undermined largely 
by a deterioration in chinas economic performance the cia 
reported to congress this past week that china was in the worst 
economic slump of a decade with rampant urban unemployment a drop 
in foreign investment and a 1 billion decline in tourism revenue 
as a result of the crackdown 
fangs release appeared timed to reach out to the seven major 
industrialized countries whose leaders will be meeting in houston 
texas on july 9 for their annual summit japan is expected to 
propose an easing of the sanctions against china 
in addition the us congress is debating whether to approve an 
extension of trade benefits to china ordered by president bush last 
month despite misgivings in congress lawmakers are unlikely to 
muster sufficient votes to overrule bushs decision

the late world war ii army officer accused of 
stealing priceless german art treasures at the end of the war 
stumbled onto them during a battle and simply shipped them home in 
a plain brown wrapper a friend says 
owen hunsaker a college classmate of joe t meador said his 
friend agonized over whether to return the stolen medieval 
artworks but loved them too much to part with them the dallas 
morning news reported friday 
he said meador was running for cover during fighting near 
quedlinburg germany when he ended up in a mine shaft and 
discovered an aladdins cave 
the army lieutenant filled his jacket with as many treasures 
as he could hold hunsaker said he then mailed the artworks home 
in a box wrapped in plain brown paper and marked old books 
hunsaker 71 of new york said meador told him the story during 
a visit in 1948 they had been college classmates in the 1930s and 
kept in touch until a few years before meadors death in 1980 
the religious treasures stored in the mine shaft for safekeeping 
from retreating nazi forces disappeared in april 1945 they 
belonged to quedlinburg cathedral 
lawyers for the quedlinburg church contend meador stole the 
treasures and kept them in his hometown of whitewright texas a 
tiny town about 60 miles north of dallas 
the church wants the treasures returned and has asked a federal 
judge to prevent meadors heirs from moving or disposing of the 
artworks believed to be stored in nearby bank vaults 
hunsakers account is the first offering an explanation of how 
meador allegedly discovered and shipped the artworks that include a 
bejeweled goldcovered manuscript crucifixes and ancient coins 
the artworks were gifts to the church from germanys earliest 
kings 
during hunsakers 1948 visit to whitewright meador took the 
socalled illuminated manuscript wrapped in an old texas quilt 
from a bedroom closet he said 
it was unbelievable said hunsaker i knew i was touching 
ancient history 
he said it had an elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels 
highlighted with a silver figure of christ with his hand risen in 
blessing 
hunsaker said he frequently urged meador to turn over the 
artwork to authorities 
when he looked at it hed get a dreary transported look on 
his face because he knew what he had he loved it and he 
couldnt part with it he struggled with that a lot hunsaker 
said 
meador considered taking the artworks to mexico to obtain phony 
ownership papers but abandoned the plan because he feared border 
police he said 
joe knew he had a hot potato hunsaker said he couldnt 
let everybody know about it and he certainly couldnt sell it

strikers shut down honduras only 
oil refinery friday in solidarity with a walkout at the usbased 
chiquita fruit company and a company official said the country 
would be out of fuel in three days 
union leaders at another major us company castle and cooke a 
subsidiary of standard fruit of new york threatened to strike 
monday if chiquita brands doesnt accede to its workers 
demands said mauro gonzalez a union leader chiquita and 
standard fruit control virtually the entire honduran banana 
industry 
late friday chiquita notified a special labor relations board 
it was willing to start negotiations saturday to end the strike a 
leader of the banana workers union said in an interview 
the fourmember board consists of two congressmen deputy labor 
minister porfirio gomez and deputy interior minister roque pascua 
the situation is improving said union president rene 
ayestas 
workers shut the gates of the refinery in puerto cortez at 6 
am after working all night to get out a final shipment of 
gasoline said manuel crespo head of texaco caribbean inc a 
subsidiary of texaco inc of harrison ny 
if there isnt a rapid resolution to the strike honduras will 
be out of fuel in three days he said 
the head of the refinery workers union roberto zaldivar said 
the refinery is paralyzed and the fuel supply is cut as of 
today 
both zaldivar and crespo spoke in telephone interviews from 
puerto cortez 186 miles north of the capital near the coastal city 
of san pedro sula 
texacos 2000 workers are the second wave of what could become 
a nationwide strike on thursday 10000 chiquita employees went on 
strike for higher wages affiliated unions representing tens of 
thousands of workers have said they may join the strike in 
solidarity 
president rafael leonard callejas said he had been in nearly 
constant contact with union leaders for days in a bid to stave off 
a crippling national strike 
i hope there will be a satisfactory resolution today for the 
good of the country the president said in a brief interview 
callejas has been plagued by labor unrest since he took office 
in january but the current strike is the most serious the 
president said friday he has asked other unions not to join the 
walkout 
there are fears protracted labor unrest could destabilize 
honduras one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere with 
a yearly per capita income of 740 
juan ferrera president of the chamber of commerce and industry 
appealed to the government to refrain from using force to end the 
strike 
political talent and negotiation should predominate in this 
moment of crisis in the government not repression he said 
a presidential commission has been in la lima headquarters of 
chiquita for days trying to negotiate a settlement la lima is 
near san pedro sula 
the strikers want a 60 percent raise their last raise was in 
1984 and honduras has suffered annual inflation of about 50 percent 
since then 
but chiquita has said it wont give its workers who make an 
average of 1532 a day any more money 
the strike is illegal it doesnt make sense we arent going 
to pay higher salaries to our workers chiquita vice president 
eduardo aragon said thursday the cincinnatibased companys full 
name is chiquita brands international inc 
the head of chiquita brands in honduras karl f koch said 
friday the company would dock strikers pay 
bananas are honduras most important crop export and chiquita 
controls 60 percent of the market the company formerly united 
brands and before that united fruit has enjoyed a near monopoly 
on honduran bananas since 1912 
texaco enjoys a complete monopoly in addition to running the 
nations only refinery it controls all 100 service stations in 
honduras texaco refines 8000 of the 12000 barrels a month the 
nation consumes and imports the rest already refined 
honduras was the first central american nation to be dubbed a 
banana republic because of the vast influence of the us fruit 
companies although that influence has declined this impoverished 
indebted nation of 48 million residents still heavily depends on 
its neighbors to the north

administration officials told congress on 
thursday the vietnamese government can account for hundreds more of 
2302 american service people still missing from the indochina war 
but there is no compelling evidence that any americans still 
live in captivity in southeast asia they said 
from evidence that the vietnamese stored the remains of us 
casualties and carefully collected their identification documents 
we must conclude that a serious effort on their part could result 
in an accounting for many hundreds more of our men rear adm 
ronald f marryott deputy director of the defense intelligence 
agency testified to a house panel 
the agency independently confirmed 10yearold information that 
vietnam stored 400 or more us remains in a warehouse said 
marryott this was first reported more than a decade ago by a 
vietnamese mortician who said he personally prepared more than 260 
bodies for storage he said 
in addition us experts found that a substantial number of 
the remains repatriated by the vietnamese showed signs of longterm 
storage the admiral told the foreign affairs subcommittee on 
asian and pacific affairs 
captured vietnamese documents described how americans who died 
or were killed were to be buried while their personal effects and 
documents along with the exact location of burial to be forwarded 
to hanoi marryott said 
this provides convincing evidence that the vietnamese can be 
much more forthcoming than they have been in accounting for missing 
americans i think you will agree we are justified in expecting 
them to provide this documentation he added 
we believe the vietnamese government has information in its 
possession that could help resolve the fate of a significant number 
of missing americans testified assistant secretary of state 
richard solomon

iraqi president saddam hussein reiterated in an 
interview broadcast thursday his threat to use chemical weapons 
against israel if it ever used its nuclear weapons against his 
country 
in the interview on abcs primetime live hussein was asked 
to explain an earlier declaration that whoever threatens us with 
the atomic bomb we will annihilate him with binary chemical 
weapons 
i said clearly this if israel were to attack iraq or the 
arabs we shall respond back hussein said 
you are saying that only if israel threatens nuclear weapons 
would you respond with chemical weapons anchor diane sawyer 
asked 
yes this is what i said 
he refused to say whether he was seeking nuclear weapons himself 
i say to you clearly now that iraq is not in possession of 
nuclear weapons hussein said 
and in search of the technology 
i shall not answer that he replied but i say also 
clearly that it is the right of every nation and every people to 
defend itself 
hussein also said he his country did not want a war because 
iraq knows what war means so if we expect an adventure we expect 
it from israel 
the wall street journal on thursday quoted hussein as saying war 
was inevitable unless the united states blocks what he perceived as 
israels aggressive policies 
he added that other countries are mistaken if they believe iraq 
is too tired from eight years of fighting with iran to indulge in 
a new war 
their assessment is totally wrong he said we shall 
respond to an israeli attack whenever it comes and wherever 
in the abc interview sawyer also asked hussein about the cult 
of personality he has built around himself including a law that 
authorizes the death penalty for insulting the iraqi president 
in your country the law does not punish whoever tries to 
insult the president hussein asked 
no it certainly does not sawyer replied half the 
country would be in prison three quarters of the country 
and no measures would be taken against anybody insulting the 
president 
to the contrary they get their own television show

a jury found a 19yearold woman innocent 
thursday of recruiting her former boyfriend to kill her tyrannical 
mother 
the jury acquitted karin aparo on a charge of accessory to 
murder and declared it was hopelessly deadlocked on a second less 
serious charge of conspiracy 
superior court judge thomas h corrigan declared a mistrial on 
the conspiracy charge the verdict came after 35 hours of 
deliberations over nine days 
as the jury filed into the courtroom foreman richard meister 
winked at aparo she broke into a smile hugged her attorney 
hubert santos and started to cry as meister announced the verdict 
she later hugged two of the jurors saying i owe them my life 
aparos father michael aparo embraced her outside the 
courthouse and smiled broadly 
meister and other jurors said they didnt believe the testimony 
of dennis coleman aparos former boyfriend he confessed to the 
murder was sentenced to 34 years in prison and agreed to testify 
against aparo 
i found it personally hard to believe that somebody would kill 
for a girl that was twotiming him said juror michael ward 
he said jurors doubted colemans motives in testifying 
he was very sly he was very calculating he said of 
coleman it could be revenge it could be parole revenge 
considering he was sold out by her struck me right away 
aparo testified during the fourweek trial that although she had 
fantasized about killing her 47yearold mother joyce aparo she 
had nothing to do with the murder 
aparo insisted coleman acted alone out of misguided jealousy 
when he broke into the glastonbury condominium she shared with her 
mother on aug 5 1987 strangled mrs aparo in her bed drove her 
body to bernardston mass and dumped it under a highway bridge 
aparo said coleman blamed her mother for destroying their 
relationship and believed mrs aparo had encouraged karin to have 
an affair with another man 
this boy was already twisted in my mind and he had enough 
motive all of his own for the murder said the jury foreman 
assistant states attorney james thomas portrayed aparo as a 
cold and manipulative woman who was the driving force behind the 
murder plot 
during four days of testimony coleman said the teenager had 
begged him to kill her mother for more than a year 
theres not a whole lot of justice in what happened today 
coleman told wfsbtv in a telephone interview from jail you want 
to call somebody shrewd you want to call somebody a liar that 
would be her 
to have found aparo guilty of accessory the jurors would have 
had to find that she asked coleman to kill her mother or somehow 
helped him commit the crime on the conspiracy charge the jury 
would have had to find that aparo had an agreement with coleman to 
kill her mother 
aparo had faced up to 60 years prison term on the accessory and 
up to 20 years on the conspiracy charge 
hartford states attorney john bailey said his office will 
decide within two or three weeks whether to try aparo again on the 
conspiracy charge

an error in the grinding and polishing of the 
main mirrors aboard the hubble space telescope has been pinpointed 
as the cause of a focus flaw that crippled the 15 billion 
orbiting observatory 
an official of hughes danbury optical co which manufactured 
the mirrors said thursday night that experiments with signals from 
the hubble have confirmed that a mistake was made in the tedious 
threeyear process of making the primary and secondary hubble 
mirrors 
with fairly high certainty we have concluded that the 
shape of one of the mirrors is not correct said terence facey a 
hughes danbury engineer who helped nasa isolate the source of the 
hubble focusing problem 
he said it was not known which mirror is flawed but that may be 
discovered by searching the connecticut companys records of tests 
conducted during the months of grinding and polishing required to 
turn footthick spherical glass blanks into the telescope mirrors

police groups who have campaigned against 
semiautomatic assault rifles are getting the credit following a 
narrow vote by the senate to maintain curbs on nine such weapons in 
an omnibus anticrime bill 
why we won is that law enforcement did a better lobbying job 
than the national rifle association sen dennis deconcini 
dariz said thursday after the senate voted 5048 to maintain the 
curbs 
tougher penalties for federal firearms violations sexual abuse 
of children and selling the new narcotic drug ice also went 
into the bill as senators worked past midnight this morning 
the senate also rejected efforts to drop numerous death penalty 
provisions in the anticrime bill it did vote to let indians decide

spring is poppypicking time and 
schools around this ancient roman city put up signs reading 
closed for the opium season 
principals teachers and students go into the fields of east 
lebanons fertile bekaa valley to harvest the afyoon the opium 
poppies whose sap is the base for heroin sold in the united states 
europe and the middle east 
we have to make a living said a school principal working in 
the fields who identified himself only as hussein how can i 
support a family of six on 50000 pounds 80 a month 
the bekaa once was the breadbasket of lebanon but traditional 
agriculture has given way to more profitable crops 
about 20000 bekaa residents including 700 students as young as 
8 earn 4 a day each for harvesting the sap from poppies during 
the monthlong season 
farmers said 40000 kilograms of the extract would be refined 
this year into 4000 kilos of heroin worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars at street prices in the united states a kilo equals 22 
pounds 
burma the worlds leading opium producer is expected to 
harvest at least 40 times as much as lebanon 
sources in baalbek said there were up to 10 heroinprocessing 
laboratories in the bekaa three run by frenchmen they said 
several westerners were seen regularly at the homes of the areas 
drug dealers 
the bekaa has long been a major source of narcotics for years 
it produced large quantities of highgrade hashish that lebanons 
private armies christian and moslem smuggled to make money for 
weapons 
after 15 years of civil war the central government has become 
almost powerless to curb the drug trade and hashish has given way 
to opium 
farmers said hashish made from marijuana was less profitable 
and more difficult to transport because of its greater bulk 
growers can sell a kilogram of opium extract for 100 to the 
clans who run the narcotics business in the bekaa but a kilo of 
hashish fetches only 8 to 20 depending on quality 
farmers in baalbek said this years yield was their best yet 
which reduced the price of raw opium to half the 200 a kilogram it 
brought last year 
drugdealing clans have longstanding links to the militias and 
to the syrians who occupy the bekaa so the civil war rarely 
touches the valley the clans sell heroin to major drug cartels for 
about 350000 a kilogram 
western narcotics agencies say the lebanese heroin trade is 
worth about 14 billion a year but banking sources in western 
europe where much of the drug money is laundered give estimates 
of up to 5 billion 
interpol the international police agency based in paris 
estimates global narcotics profits at 500 billion a year 
a recent us state department report described lebanon as a 
key processing and transit point for heroin but its narcotics 
production is far short of colombia pakistan afghanistan and the 
southeast asias golden triangle 
antidrug agencies are concerned about lebanon because militias 
control much of the country and operate illegal ports that are one 
of the main conduits for smuggled drugs 
syrian army officers in the bekaa valley profit from the trade 
and protect it the state department report said 
about 25000 of the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon are based in 
the bekaa and north lebanon 
no one bothers us not the syrians nor the lebanese said 
mahmoud shallash a syrian who works in the poppy fields this is 
a free zone 
along with the bekaa villagers hundreds of syrians mostly 
women cross the border with their families to work with the 
afyoon 
ihab 13 said he was doing it to buy a bicycle 
did his parents know what he was doing they grow the stuff 
themselves ihab said 
jazieh alali left her husband behind in a village near aleppo 
in northern syria to work in the fields 
she and two of her six children make 390 a month her husband 
a government employee is paid 214

the loopy overthetop 1940s screen comedies of 
screenwriterdirector preston sturges have a manic energy and 
ironic style that identifies them even without a screen credit 
its fitting that american masters the distinguished pbs 
documentary series on american creative artists opens its fifth 
season tonight with the littleknown life of the first screenwriter 
to establish himself as a director 
a colleague frank capra said sturges was a strange guy 
carried his own hill with him i tell you 
where capras movies exalted the decent common man sturges 
lampooned a public willing to believe anything it was told 
his farces are filled with press agents politicians and 
confidence men who traffic in american values without believing in 
them despite their comic invention his plots always contained a 
savage bitter truth 
in the great mcginty brian donleavy plays a cynical bum who 
rises to wealth and political power through a corrupt system only 
to be tossed back into the gutter when he becomes an honest man 
in sullivans travels joel mccrea plays an idealistic film 
director who travels incognito to experience poverty and suffering 
then gets an overdose of it 
in the miracle at morgans creek betty hutton is a young 
woman who gives birth to sextuplets without knowing who their 
father is the wildly factitious story wrote critic james 
agee makes comic virtues of every censordodging necessity 
thanks to these devices the hays office has been either hypnotized 
into a liberality for which it should be thanked or has been raped 
in its sleep 
agee also wrote that sturges life read as dizzily as his 
screenplays 
the son of a chicago stockbroker preston had a miserable 
childhood trailing his flighty mother on a marathon of european 
museums and theaters 
his mother mary desti an intimate chum of isadora duncan gave 
the ballerina the long scarf that snagged on a sportscar wheel and 
broke her neck she also founded the paris cosmetics firm where 
sturges worked as a teenager 
after serving in the army air corps in world war i he returned 
to cosmetics and invented a kissproof lipstick he then worked as 
a freelance inventor and was a complete failure by age 30 when 
his appendix ruptured 
after six weeks in the hospital he decided to become a 
playwright he discarded his first play his second written in six 
days and called strictly dishonorable was a big hit on 
broadway and ran for 557 performances 
sturges went hollywood after writing 13 screenplays paramount 
studios let him direct his screenplay of the great mcginty 
which became the sleeper hit of 1940 and established him as 
hollywoods wonder boy 
it was an uneasy success for it threatened the studio system 
and made others in the industry jealous sturges as prodigal with 
his talent as his money made a string of great films and a string 
of bad ones 
he left paramount to work with howard hughes beginning the 
precipitous decline of his career by 1950 he was spent he died 
of a heart attack at the algonquin hotel in new york city on aug 
6 1959 
the sympathetic portrayal on american masters is a terrific 
introduction to sturges it is liberally intercut with clips from 
his greatest pictures and includes telling interviews with his 
friends and contemporaries 
the series has a promising lineup for the summer months next 
week american masters examines the career of actor and 
director john cassavetes on july 16 the series profiles director 
martin scorsese in addition to an extensive biography and 
interviews the scorsese profile looks at his new film good 
fellas the adaptation of nicholas pileggis wiseguy 
other masters profiles scheduled are composer cole porter 
newsman edward r murrow musician charlie parker record producer 
john hammond and author isaac bashevis singer

when president bush needs a surefire applause 
line to spark up a lackluster speech he can count on his wife 
barbara 
its not that she offers snappy comments its the mere mention 
of her name that evokes applause 
on his many politicking sorties out of washington the president 
increasingly brings greetings from bar relays her regrets that 
she couldnt be there praises her dedication to the cause of 
literacy brags about her wellesley graduation speech or gripes 
about her affinity for the vegetable he hates broccoli 
his most recent and best crowdpleasing boast is about the first 
ladys triumph in the wellesley commencement address flap 
mrs bushs june 1 speech to the graduates generally was 
acclaimed as a smash hit when she first was announced as the 
speaker some students objected strongly arguing that she is well 
known largely because of her husband rather than her own 
accomplishments 
afterward bush immediately began gloating about the warm 
response to mrs bushs simple direct talk he was reminding 
audiences about it recently 
i thought it came out pretty well bar bush seven 
wellesley you know what he said at a charlotte fundraising 
dinner for sen jesse helms rnc 
and noting a lively batch of antihelms protesters outside the 
fundraising dinner he commented theyre upset because they 
think that the only reason i was invited to speak this evening is 
because im barbara bushs husband 
that brought a roar from the helms loyalists 
bush even has taken to quoting his wife 
at a recent ribboncutting for a childrens facility at the 
national institutes for health in bethesda md the president 
cited the wellesley speech 
the devotion that led to the new nih home for seriously ill 
children and their families he said reminded him of mrs bushs 
sentiment that family is the key to everything 
she told the graduates there you will never regret not 
having passed one more test not winning one more verdict or not 
closing one more deal you will regret however the time not spent 
with a husband a friend a child or a parent 
the nih crowd applauded but then the audiences always warm to 
the mention of the first lady whose popularity surpasses even her 
husbands high public opinionpoll ratings 
early in his presidency bush used to tell audiences that he was 
pleased to learn they requested a visit from the most popular and 
wellknown person in america but sorry he would tell them 
barbara couldnt make it today 
on a trip earlier this month to several midwestern states bush 
worked mrs bushs birthday into a series of fundraising speeches 
benefiting republican candidates 
i wish that barbara were here on her birthday the hero of 
wellesley he told an omaha neb luncheon im very very 
proud of her he added 
talking about his wife also gives the president a chance to poke 
fun at himself a technique that tends to go over well 
for example bush would like to golf a lot better than he does 
and made note of it while playing in a tournament in kingwood 
texas barbara wanted to be here he said but didnt want to 
see her husband cry

many of the old scenes of summer kids with 
fireworks families huddled in cars at drivein movies the good 
humor man and his truck are fading from the american landscape 
but while summer is different now the lust for fun be it in a 
video arcade on or a hang glider is ever strong 
in the 1950s the status of your vacation was determined by 
how far you could drive and still survive says michael marsden 
a professor of american studies at bowling green state university 
in ohio now its how much you can pack into it people go away 
for vacation and come back exhausted 
americans jaded by a world where science fiction quickly 
becomes fact are starved for intense experiences that feed all 
their senses marsden says 
we just dont sit around on the front porch anymore he 
says were not interested in that were interested in living 
life 
as society becomes more frenetic summer might be the only time 
left for families to be together 
but dualincome families have less time summer or winter to 
spend together and households headed by single parents usually 
lack the funds and time to take even brief summer breaks 
the situation could worsen as recreation becomes more hightech 
and summer activities that once promoted togetherness disappear 
movies always have been an important summer ritual in america 
once carloads of families and amorous teenagers congregated 
almost religiously at driveins on humid summer nights 
now weeds grow over the driveins and moviegoers drive to chilly 
cinemas in shopping malls where they can choose from a dozen or 
more blockbusters 
fireworks the kind launched by dad at a july 4th picnic once 
exploded across the summer sky then were mostly extinguished by 
stringent federal bans 
now kids fire off explosions themselves albeit by computerized 
laser cannons on nearly lifelike video games 
even the good humor man and his ice cream truck melted away when 
the vendors in spiffy white uniforms were replaced by college 
students in tshirts and jeans 
there used to be a nostalgia with the trucks and the uniforms 
they were wellreceived by the community laments alice durocher 
head of durocher eterprises a chicagobased ice cream distribution 
firm 
alas in the healthconscious 1990s such a demise might have 
been inevitable ice cream is fattening after all and its easier 
to get frozen yogurt in the mall after the movie at the multiplex 
so in the brave new world of the hightech summer where those 
long lazy days are no longer so lazy what is the fast fun we 
seek 
summer still is movie time especially since jaws and star 
wars showed hollywood that megabucks could be made from colossal 
science fiction and adventure films 
lowtech driveins though couldnt match the picture and sound 
of cinemas in screening the new special effects extravaganzas and 
slid into decline says beth cameron who researches the fiscal 
health of leisure industries for smith barney in new york 
theme parks ever popular are being updated once preeminent 
disney world in florida faces competition from new universal 
studios florida 
the tour employs a multimedia approach to create realistic 
scenes that can frighten and thrill audiences unlike disneys more 
gentle approach 
they want to shock the pants off people cameron says 
people apparently want to be shocked amusement parks and their 
daredevil rides continue to draw summer crowds america it seems 
is undergoing a roller coaster renaissance 
whats happening is rides in general and coasters in 
particular are getting bigger faster wilder and yet safer than 
ever before says paul ruben editor of rollercoaster magazine 
i think everyone seeks adventure ruben says a great 
roller coaster ride will make your heart pound your adrenalin 
pump it will make you feel alive 
some summer pleasures remain simple that most hallowed of 
summer pastimes baseball still fascinates americans little boys 
and girls still sign up for little league and their parents still 
play for softball teams sponsored by local businesses 
and despite television attendance figures for major league 
games are good marsden says 
sporting goods and camping equipment continue to sell briskly 
americans snapped up more than 44 billion in sports gear last 
year says glenn bischoff a spokesman for the national sporting 
goods association in chicago 
but the implements of fitness like everything else have grown 
more complicated than a wooden louisville slugger 
ten years ago you had barbells and stationary bikes says 
bischoff now you have stairclimbers treadmills and rowing 
machines people are always willing to pay for more bells and 
whistles 
americans marsden observes want to tie up their summer 
recreation with hightech gadgets fun thats too simple might not 
be so much fun he says 
tennis become popularized and accessible and then no one 
wanted to play marsden says now weve got bigger rackets 
complex alloys its become fancier and more costly so now people 
want to play again 
the next hightech summer thrills gadget may lie literally on 
the horizon 
para gliding a cheaper and simpler version of hang gliding is 
just sailing into this country from europe 
for about 2000 an enthusiast can purchase a pack that 
contains a sophisticated nylon parachute that billows out into a 
wing when filled with wind put simply the user dons the pack 
runs downhill and into the wind and becomes airborne 
this says peter zimmerli president of the american para 
gliding association is going to be big

america has gone goofy this summer and 
mickey and king kong and shamu 
the tourist behemoth that includes orlando and its environs 
draws 13 million visitors a year and this summer should cement 
central floridas reputation as the nations favorite vacation 
destination 
universal studios florida a glitzy hightech version of the 
california attraction opened officially june 7 and is expected to 
be a strong competitor to the yearold disneymgm studios 
either of the two movie parks would be the largest attraction 
almost anywhere else but here they stand in the shadow of disney 
world with its epcot center and stand shoulder to shoulder with 
sea world cypress gardens and other older tourist attractions 
of course not everyone can go to disney world if they did 
the lines would rival the queues that form for just about any 
staple in moscow 
so come vacation time this summer some will go to their nearest 
beaches some will flee to the mountains some will stay at home 
and avoid doing the home projects they had planned 
but some will join the crowds who flock to the popular vacation 
spots 
what follows is a tour of a few of those spots as selected by 
voit gilmore president of the american society of travel agents

to 5 percent in the number of visitors says gene cotter of the 
hawaii visitors bureau 
this is not ascribed to any new attractions no one has built a 
kilauea adventure ride with mock lava spewing on appreciative 
mainlanders 
firsttime visitors about 47 percent of the traffic usually 
zero in on oahu the main island and possibly one other island 
cotter said their agenda is sightseeing luaus are still big 
and some beach time 
the outer islands are prized by repeat visitors there are few 
tourist attractions instead vacationers must be satisfied with 
the lush beauty of tropical islands 
they really are beautiful places says mike foley of the 
polynesian cultural center

forget yosemite forget yellowstone great smoky mountains 
national park is the most popular national park in the country 
drawing 85 million visitors last year 
this partly due to an accident of geography the park is within 
a twoday drive of half the nations population 
but it also is testament to the parks 520000 acres straddling 
the tennesseenorth carolina border its 16 6000foot mountains 
its 975 miles of hiking trails including 70 miles of the 
appalachian trail and 700 miles of fishable streams 
it is hard to believe that a park of this size could be crowded 
but spokeswoman nancy gray said popular campsites are fully booked 
on weekends a month in advance and traffic on the two main roads 
is growing 
a high percentage of our visitors are the kind who stay in the 
car and do a windshield experience she said

center and times square but thats not all they have a hankering 
to visit the new york stock exchange 
everyone wants to see that said jack macbean a spokesman 
for the new york convention and visitors bureau i guess because

in new york theyre flocking to see the market that crashed in 
1987 in alaska vacationers are boarding sightseeing boats that 
will take them to the site of another disaster bligh reef where 
the tanker exxon valdez went aground last year 
the resulting spill frightened the alaskan tourist industry 
visitors had declined by 40000 a year in 1987 and 1988 and there 
was reason to believe tourism would join wildlife and the shoreline 
as victims of the black goop 
it didnt happen exxon poured thousands of dollars into tourism 
advertising to counteract the pictures of polluted alaska and the 
state launched a successful campaign to explain the size of alaska 
and point out the many uncontaminated places 
tourism rebounded to the level of 1986 when more than three 
quarters of a million visitors came to alaska 
more than half of the alaska visitors arrive with a package or 
charter tour 
typically these include lodging at anchorage a train ride 
north to denali national park to see north americas highest peak 
mount mckinley a prince william sound boat tour to see glaciers 
flightseeing seeing alaska by air from small planes and 
fishing excursions to the kenai river or south central bays

blacks are winning historic nominations for 
key state offices as more experienced candidates enter the fray 
but few analysts expect them to make more than minimal gains in the 
november elections 
black candidates are a couple of election cycles away from 
winning a lot of things but one or two wins are within reach in 
1990 said democratic political consultant bob beckel 
one of the races being watched most closely is the north 
carolina senate race where black democrat harvey gantt is 
challenging republican sen jesse helms in another highprofile 
contest andrew young is vying for the democratic gubernatorial 
nomination in georgia 
currently the nation has one black governor no black senators 
and 24 black us house members 
most of the primary election victories for blacks have come in 
the south where the black population is the greatest the pattern 
there seems to be following that of virginias l douglas wilder 
who last year became the nations first black elected governor 
like wilder many in the current crop of black democratic 
candidates and nominees cut their political teeth in local office 
or government appointments wilder who had served in the state 
legislature ran and won as an incumbent lieutenant governor 
these are mostly black political leaders who were not in the 
civil rights movement who came into politics through elected 
offices starting at local city council and mayors and on up 
beckel said 
i just think its a process of finally coming into their 
own he said 
cheryl miller senior researcher at the joint center for 
political and economic studies a black thinktank doubts there 
will be any significant victories this year among the black 
statewide and primary runoff winners 
but she said the early primary votes signal the glass ceiling 
is not continuing to be an obstacle in the movement toward 
statewide candidacies by blacks and give encouragement to others 
who might consider running for statewide office 
in north carolina gantt the former twoterm mayor of 
charlotte defied conventional wisdom in last months runoff 
election and became the nations first black democratic senate 
nominee 
gantt faces a formidable opponent in seeking to unseat helms 
who raised 17 million in his 1984 race and already has sounded the 
financial alarm to his supporters 
but democratic leaders say helms is vulnerable and point to 
polls showing support for his reelection at just 28 percent to 33 
percent and early surveys showing gantt gaining on or leading helms 
we see north carolina as one of the best opportunities for a 
democrat in 1990 said democratic senatorial campaign committee 
spokeswoman anita dunn 
im a betting man and i think people who write off gantts 
chances in north carolina are wrong said beckel that race 
looks as difficult now as one doug wilders race looked about eight 
or nine months before the election 
democratic state sen theo mitchell won his primary and earlier 
this month became south carolinas first black gubernatorial 
nominee for a major party since reconstruction but he is 
considered a distant longshot in his general election campaign 
against popular gop gov carroll campbell 
opinions are divided on whether andrew young will emerge from a 
democratic primary and likely runoff to become the partys 
gubernatorial nominee in georgia 
young whose roots are in the civil rights movement of the 
1960s faces a strong challenge from lt gov zell miller and 
others in the july 17 primary young the former mayor of atlanta 
has angered some blacks by breaking ranks and refusing to join a 
lawsuit filed by blacks seeking to abolish runoff elections in the 
state 
additionally said pollster claiborne darden andy has not 
cemented a moderate to conservative image like wilder 
on the republican side kenneth muskie harris beat out a 
white supremacist to get the nod for the lieutenant governors spot 
on the gop ticket in arkansas it marks only the second time a 
black has been a majorparty nominee for a constitutional office in 
the state 
harris who runs a government grant program has never held 
elected office but is getting assistance from the republican party 
and expects a real boost after a visit from vice president dan 
quayle early this month 
republican party spokeswoman leslie goodman acknowledges the 
party is playing catchup in recruiting blacks but said the gop is 
working vigorously to fulfill party chairman lee atwaters 
political and moral imperative to include minorities 
the gop also is fielding black statewide candidates for 
lowerlevel offices in oklahoma and rhode island but most of the 
partys outreach energy is aimed at congressional campaigns 
former federal housing aide kenneth blackwells drive to fill 
the congressional seat left open by retiring ohio democrat thomas 
luken is a top target for republicans according to republican 
national committee cochairman jeanie austin the former cincinnati 
city councilman and mayor is up against lukens son charles 
in another race being closely watched black businessman al 
brown is challenging democratic rep romano mazzoli in louisville

its been a long haul from a shotgun house on 
a tennessee cotton farm to the country club hills address of koko 
taylors new home 
born and raised in a long narrow cabin on a sharecroppers farm 
outside memphis taylor 61 moved last month into a new home in 
the posh chicago suburb of country club hills between addresses 
spans a lifetime of the blues 
the latest chapter includes the release in april of a new album 
jump for joy on alligator records and her appearance in wild 
at heart director david lynchs new black comedy which won the 
golden palm award as the best film at the 43rd cannes film festival 
they called up alligator and wanted a woman blues singer to 
sing two songs taylor said in a recent interview as she prepared 
to move from her south side bungalow 
and i went out there to los angeles to do the part and man 
i aint stopped grinning yet because i was so happy about it and 
im still happy about it i cant wait for the movie to come out 
because i think im going to be the first one at the theater first 
time i had ever been live in a real movie 
taylor filmed a scene in the movie in which she appears with a 
band in a nightclub where a fight breaks out she performs two 
pieces written by lynch and described by taylors manager and 
alligator president bruce iglauer as 
grotesquecabaretbluesinfluenced ballads 
neither taylor nor iglauer plan to make movies a new direction 
for a career that started with family jam sessions on homemade 
instruments in tennessee although iglauer said he would like to 
see taylor portray herself in a film performing the blues is the 
staple that keeps taylors life together 
the only thing i have in mind is to keep on doing what im 
doing and making people happy all over the world with my music is 
my dream and what i enjoy doing most taylor said 
that dream was nurtured in tennessee cotton fields 
i used to listen to the radio and when i was about 18 years 
old bb king was a disc jockey and he had a radio program 15 
minutes a day over in west memphis ark and he would play the 
blues and i would hear different records and things by muddy 
waters bessie smith memphis minnie sonnyboy williams and all 
these people you know which i just loved 
my oldest brother made himself a guitar by putting hay bailing 
wire tying it on a nail in the back of our little shotgun house 
and my little brother made hisself a harmonica out of a corn cob 
and of course i was the vocalist and we would all get together 
and jam and sing and play music and entertain ourselves she said 
also in the meantime my dad said everybody in the household 
had to go to church so every sunday i went to church and i grew 
up singing gospel i would sing in the church choir every sunday 
so what it amounted to was you know we would sing gospel on 
sunday and blues on monday 
taylor began adding the blues to the rest of her week after 
coming to chicago with richard pops taylor her husband of 35 
years who died last year they set up house on the south side home 
to a bustling music scene and cradle of the rawedged urban sound 
of chicago blues the roster of local bands playing in the 1950s 
and 60s in this clubland was a whos who of blues talent muddy 
waters howlin wolf elmore james buddy guy and others 
i started going to these local clubs me and my husband and 
everybody got to know us taylor said and then the guys would 
start letting me sit in you know come up on the bandstand and do 
a tune 
that was for fun the blues as a business began about 1963 when 
composer willie dixon working for chess records at the time heard 
her singing with howlin wolfs band 
he said you know you can really sing the blues he said 
i never heard a woman sing the blues like you sing the blues he 
said thats what the world needs today is more womens to sing the 
blues he said we got plenty men singing the blues but its 
more women 
taylors bestselling record to date was wang dang doodle 
written by dixon and recorded reluctantly by taylor in 1964 
i thought it was the silliest sounding song i had ever heard 
talk of she said acknowledging now that the records success 
got her career rolling 
it is still rolling along taylor still tours nine months a 
year doing mostly onenight stands she has recorded 12 albums 
and jump for joy her sixth for alligator is winning critical 
acclaim shes been nominated for a grammy award for seven of her 
last eight records and won for best blues recording in 1984 
the thing with koko is the combination of the talent as a 
musician and the talent as a performer because in blues you cant 
really separate them iglauer said and the third part of that 
is kokos professionalism and by that i dont just mean showing 
up on time i mean its her willingness to perform 
in addition to performing one of taylors other interests for 
the future is to return to the book she is writing to chronicle her 
life 
i dont know if the book will ever be published or not but if 
it dont ill just know i wrote it and ill enjoy doing it she 
said 
theres been a resurgence in the popularity of the blues and 
taylor is reaping the benefits 
i believe that the blues are going all the way to the top 
because right now blues is getting more recognition than it has 
ever gotten in the past and thats all it needs and thats all it 
takes because the blues never got the recognition she said

simon mahlathini delicately replaced the 
halfsmoked camel in its pack the growling singer of south 
africas township jive would save the cigarette until after the 
interview 
the gesture was indicative with worldwide acclaim coming to his 
group 26 years after its founding mahlathini still has the thrift 
born of life in south africas deprived black townships he and his 
three mahotella queens still cling to their identity as the musical 
heartandsoul of township music 
nothing has changed said mildred manxola the boisterous 
anchor of the trio that accompanies mahlathini white people are 
enjoying our music they dont understand the words but they hear 
the beat for us to see them dancing means they really 
understand it 
founded in 1964 the group fell on rough times in the 1970s 
while funk and disco flourished and broke up but they reunited in 
the early 80s and started traveling the world testing other 
styles finding new audiences and reigniting interest in 
mbaqanga a relentless dance music that blends traditional zulu 
rhythm and words street music and international pop 
the 53yearold mahlathini born simon nkabinde is called the 
lion of soweto for his raspy singing the queens manxola 
hilda tloubatia and nobesuthu shawe all in their mid40s are 
called mahotella for the many hotels theyve graced over the 
years the four are backed by their producers eclectic makgona 
tsohle band 
the group is now nearing the end of its second north american 
tour a 50city whirlwind in 2 months their first venture last 
year had a modest halfdozen stops 
im very excited that our music has been accepted said 
mahlathini a softspoken almost shy man who started performing 
at age 12 
even at home the music is getting bigger now they are 
going back to our roots in the life of south african music he 
said in an interview 
the music cooked up in the caged environment of south africas 
townships racially segregated cities where the majority black 
population lives has elements of reggae soul and even gospel in 
addition to african the driving bass lines joyous percussion and 
wailing saxophone join with the queens playful sometimes 
dissonant harmonizing to make an uplifting sound designed for 
dancing 
mahlathini quiet and reserved offstage becomes a spry 
performer onstage with his rumbling voice and staccato 
expressions all four clad in native zulu leopand skins and 
headdresses spice the music with nonstop choreographed dance 
steps 
but maintaining the style may be something of a challenge as 
they face western audiences the demand for incorporating western 
sounds into african music has increased since compatriots ladysmith 
black mambazo gained wide attention in the west on paul simons 
graceland album 
collaboration with the british group art of noise already has 
left a definite electronic mark on mahlathinis latest album 
parissoweto 
even producer west nkosi who helped refine mbaqanga in the 60s 
and discovered ladysmith black mambazo envisions using more 
western styles and pitches the practitioners of township jive as a 
doanything ensemble 
we will never say no to anybody who wants us to do something 
together because we want to show them we are a 
jackofalltrades that we can do anything said nkosi whose 
band name in zulu is translated the band that knows eveything 
mahlathinis 1987 parissoweto album distributed by 
celluloid in europe and polydor in the united states featured a 
redo of its trademark tune yebo with art of noises driving 
bass beat and electronically created yelps 
whatever the approach it hasnt overrun the groups native 
sound which is raking in wildly receptive audiences in japan 
australia europe and the united states 
we thought the americans would enjoy our music to our 
surprise we find that theyre going mad they wont let us go off 
the stage nkosi said in an interview this music is there to 
relieve anything that might have disturbed you mentally or in your 
heart you find that you are offending yourself if you listen to 
this music sitting down 
the group sees its music as psychological aid for its listeners 
much like it was in the townships during the worst of apartheid 
our people were unprivileged the only freedom they had was in 
this music nkosi said we design it to educate our children 
how to live with other people and whats happening presently to 
them and how to respect one another 
londonbased emi records produced mahlathinis first album of 
township music in 1952 then nkosi spotted him in 1964 playing 
weddings nkosi enlisted the queens in durban and produced the 
groups first album in 1964 under the whiteowned south african 
label gallo 
but getting the music out was and remains a problem he said 
blacks couldnt go into white stores to buy the albums and few 
black stores existed township radio stations were on the air only 
a few hours a week and white clubs were restricted forcing the 
group to find its audience personally 
we used to go to record stores and play in front and then 
give the record number to the audience nkosi said we went 
to the mines to find people coming from all over south africa 
nkosi split with gallo and later in 1987 took the group to 
europe where it recorded parissoweto featuring the delightful 
kazet and the raucous yebo 
but no matter where the popularity will take mahlathini and the 
mahotella queens the group will never forget where it came from 
from the very beginning it was for the people nkosi said 
it was for the struggle

health care and computers are up and banking is 
down as wall street investors appraise the economic and business 
outlook for the early 1990s 
at least thats the verdict they rendered via their choices of 
stocks to buy and sell through the first six months of the year 
medical and biotechnology stocks ranked no 1 among the 80plus 
industry group indexes calculated by dow jones amp co with a 2859 
percent gain for the first half through june 22 
others in the top 10 included software and processing stocks in 
the technology sector up 1848 percent pharmaceuticals up 1020 
percent and computers up 959 percent 
the healthcare groups prospered in part because spreading 
recession fears sent money managers at investing institutions 
scrambling after growth stocks with limited exposure to the 
business cycle for example drug manufacturers 
computer and other technology stocks meanwhile benefited from 
a rally after a languishing spell in the late 1980s 
that meant dramatic bounces in a good many smaller depressed 
hightech issues but it also promoted strong showings by such big 
names as international business machines corp and compaq computer 
corp 
ibm which traded as low as 93rsqb last december climbed past 120 
in june to help lift the dow jones industrial average to record 
highs 
for the longest time institutions thought ibms earnings were 
suspect said william lefevre an analyst at advest inc 
but there came a time when ibms earnings picture cleared up 
and when its stock price got down to the point where its dividend 
provided a 5 percent yield that institutions began buying ibm 
again 
the stocks comeback will have to continue a lot longer 
however if it is going to top the peak of 175 it reached in 1987 
before the market crash of that year 
for its part compaq hovered around 120 in late june sporting a 
gain of 50 percent since new years 
many bank and thrift institution stocks started the 90s where 
they left off in the late 1980s trying to heal the wounds of bad 
realestate loans and what many observers described as a credit 
crunch 
the list of the biggest percentage losers among nyse issues 
included bank of new england far west financial american savings 
bank of new york citytrust bancorp and southeast banking all down 
50 percent or more 
furthermore bank stocks frustrated fans got no fresh 
encouragement this spring when american telephone amp telegraph made 
a flashy foray into credit cards which have been an oasis of 
profits in the banking business 
in the hindmost ranks of the dow jones industry groups through 
june 22 moneycenter banks showed a loss of 1263 percent and a 
composite of regional banks was down 1671 percent 
by sector of the country eastern banks fell 2634 percent 
southern banks 1880 percent central 925 percent and western 
247 percent 
faced with weak real estate markets and crimped credit 
conditions homebuilding stocks also suffered falling 1990 
percent 
stock traders who sought safety from that kind of financial 
stress in goldmining stocks also took a pounding dow joness 
precious metals group fell 1650 percent

life is getting better in the 
slums of rio which symbolized the worst of third world poverty for 
decades 
brick homes are replacing wooden shacks modern services even 
banks are becoming part of the scene 
few wealthier brazilians are aware of this because they wouldnt 
have the courage to set foot in a favela as the slums are 
called 
most people think this place is overrun with bandits and drug 
dealers and that i live in a rundown shack said antonio trajano 
of rocinha the largest shantytown in latin america they dont 
believe it when i tell them im not afraid to go out at night 
in a nation where half the 150 million people have had to get 
along on less than 100 a month the poorest of the poor crowded 
into makeshift slums that ring the major cities 
city governments generally ignored the shantytowns leaving them 
without plumbing running water and electricity gunfights between 
police and drug traffickers became commonplace 
conditions were especially hard in rio where nearly onefifth 
of the metropolitan areas 105 million people live in slums areas 
of abject poverty remain but many of the larger slums have changed 
dramatically in recent years 
in jacarezinho a large shantytown across the city from rocinha 
elias lima said the neighborhood looks nothing like it did when he 
was born there 41 years ago 
the streets were dirt the houses were so slipshod they blew 
away with a major storm and there wasnt even a store to buy a loaf 
of bread he said now jacarezinho has concrete buildings as 
tall as five stories and i can buy anything i need at a store right 
here in the neighborhood 
lima who owns a party supply shop called magic balloon put up 
a twobedroom brick home with the help of neighbors a common way 
of building in the favelas 
trinidade carneiro 28 who works in a nearby pharmacy said a 
friend from a wealthy neighborhood came to visit and was amazed 
she didnt know we had schools restaurants and clubs here 
and she was surprised to see i lived in a comfortable brick house 
with indoor plumbing ms carneiro said 
major improvements in rios shantytowns began when populist 
leonel brizola was governor in 19821986 power water and at least 
partial sewerage networks were installed in the bigger slums and 
the main streets were paved 
more than 90 percent of slum homes now have electricity and 
about 80 percent have running water said licia valladares a 
sociology professor at the university research institute of rio de 
janeiro who is an expert on the favelas 
she said most new houses in the larger older slums are built of 
brick and concrete 
the new favelas that spring up are in primitive condition but 
many of the older ones are almost completely urbanized ms 
valladares said 
much of rocinha a hillside community of 200000 with a sweeping 
view of the ocean now resembles a workingclass neighborhood more 
than an outpost of the dispossessed 
butchers bakers doctors lawyers appliance stores 
pharmacies furniture stores and day care centers are plentiful 
rocinha even has its own theater group boca aberta open mouth 
which performs on a regular schedule 
we have the same quantity and quality of goods available here 
as in most middleclass neighborhoods said trajano who is 68 
and owns a small grocery 
rocinha which means little farm is the first favela with 
banking services a branch of the bank of the state of rio de 
janeiro opened last november 
not only is it safe here but weve got the best clients in 
the city said robson antonio viana the manager we havent 
had a single bounced check since we opened which is unheard of 
many residents say they suffer discrimination because of where 
they live 
when you go to look for work theres no problem until you say 
youre from rocinha said romildo marques dos santos 32 a 
security guard now unemployed thats enough not to get the job 
dos santos said the police are especially hard on slum residents 
i left here one evening in my car to buy some toothpaste and i 
forgot my documents he said the police stopped me and were 
convinced i was involved with the drug trade and held me in jail 
for three days 
similar stories are told in jacarezinho 
lucia ferrenho da silva 17 said she kept her address secret 
from her last boyfriend a middleclass rio resident she met at a 
soccer game 
i told him i lived in a neighborhood near here and always met 
him downtown she said i would only have told him i lived here 
if we had gotten serious 
life is not idyllic in rocinha and jacarezinho the possibility 
of drugrelated violence is constant garbage pickups are irregular 
and the sewer system is incomplete 
rep benedita da silva of the leftist workers party who grew up 
in the chapeu mangueira slum and is the only favelado in the 
570member national congress said 50 billion would be needed to 
modernize all the slums in brazil 
many favela residents say their neighborhoods need only a few 
improvements 
if the government spent a little bit of money to fix things 
up this would be the perfect place to live trajano said

june 1986 shao yanxiang a poet says it is the best period 
of literary creation in modern chinese history anyone can 
write the way he wants and the 100 flowers concept of free 
expression introduced by mao tsetung in 1956 has finally come 
true 
mao may have expressed the concept but those who took his 
advise and spoke out were persecuted 
maos successor deng xiaoping allowed a brief flirtation with 
free expression in the 1979 democracy wall movement some who bared 
their souls are still in prison

sylvia fidgeted with an unlit cigarette 
telling how she has spent 35 of her 49 years firing heroin into 
her veins lately she said its been harder and harder to find 
decent quality heroin 
theres only manmade chemicals out there said sylvia 
which is not her real name tugging a robe closer to her thin 
frame if there were better stuff out there word would get 
around 
yet the drug enforcement administration says there is better 
stuff out there that bumper crops of opium overseas are flooding 
the united states with pure cheap heroin 
if thats so no one seems to know where the drug is going 
health care workers for example say the number of people who 
wound up in emergency rooms and morgues because of heroin actually 
decreased last year and officials at another federal drug control 
office say theres no evidence of a heroin epidemic 
its possible that emergency room doctors and medical examiners 
may not yet be seeing the effects of purer cheaper heroin 
another theory holds that because of the drugs increased 
purity people are getting high by smoking and snorting it those 
methods are less likely than injection to cause overdoses that 
require medical care so more people could be using the drug 
without coming to the attention of authorities 
a third possibility is that the influx of heroin could be 
overstated 
the dea doesnt think so the heroin situation is booming 
said felix jimenez who heads the agencys heroin desk its 
here its absolutely here 
his predecessor ed heath said the dea is not being alarmist 
it just wants to be prepared we dont want to play catchup like 
we did with cocaine 
but david tell deputy chief of staff of the office of national 
drug control policy said such warnings are an exaggerated 
gloomanddoom prediction 
is more heroin coming into the country maybe said tell 
are more people using that heroin i would guess quite the 
opposite 
sylvia for one has given up her search for better heroin she 
recently entered the detoxification program at the francis scott 
key medical center part of the johns hopkins health system here 
if heroin on the streets is now more pure one might expect more 
addicts to accidentally overdose landing in the emergency room or 
the morgue 
however the number of heroin users who died or who required 
emergency room treatment last year leveled off in most us cities 
and even decreased in some thats according to figures compiled by 
the governments drug abuse warning network which had tracked 
steady increases during the 1980s 
only two of the 21 cities surveyed regarding emergency room 
visits bucked the downward trend the number nearly doubled in san 
francisco and increased 10 percent in baltimore 
even in new york city which has the nations largest 
concentration of heroin addicts the number of heroinrelated 
emergency room visits declined the last two years 
the number of heroinrelated deaths fell in many cities 
including boston detroit new york philadelphia and washington 
dc but the preliminary report from a panel of medical examiners 
found some startling exceptions in chicago the number of 
heroinrelated deaths skyrocketed 655 percent from 1987 to last 
year in san diego the number rose 77 percent 
another way to track new drug trends is by monitoring people 
whove been arrested but tests of arrestees nationwide found no 
noticeable change in heroin use from 1988 to the fall of 1989 
according to justice department drug use forecasting studies 
no one knows exactly how many people use heroin in the united 
states the 1982 official estimate of 500000 heroin addicts has 
never been updated 
a 1988 household survey of drug use found 19 million americans 
aged 12 and older said they had used heroin at least once said 
mona brown spokeswoman for the national institute on drug abuse 
which conducted the survey but that number is considered 
conservative because the survey does not cover the homeless or 
people in jail 
its unclear whether there are lots of new users 
dr don c des jarlais director of chemical dependency research 
at beth israel hospital in new york said heroin today is mostly 
used by people who have used in the past 
heroin users calling the washington area council on alcoholism 
and drug abuse hot line are 28 years old and older said 
epidemiologist dr michael stoil of the council that tells me it 
is not being picked up heavily among the youth 
the dea is concerned that street heroins high potency could 
attract new users who can get high just by smoking or snorting it 
without using dangerous intravenous needles 
about 75 percent to 80 percent of heroin users at francis scott 
keys adolescent detoxification unit smoke the drug said dr 
archie golden who runs the program fifteen percent snort it and a 
few inject it 
many are likely to turn to needles eventually warned diana 
potter a nurse with the adult unit 
sometimes the kids come in and theyll say oh im never 
going to use a needle you know potter said with a knowing 
laugh we tell them a little bit down the road you keep this 
up you will be using a needle 
the dea cites several reasons for arguing that there is an 
influx of heroin studies show global opium production is on the 
rise and even though the amount of heroin seized by federal 
agencies is increasing the street price is going down 
the state departments international narcotics control strategy 
report estimates worldwide opium production this year will total as 
much as 4734 metric tons about double the 1986 estimate 
dea tests of street samples in a halfdozen cities found that 
the cost per milligram of pure heroin dropped from 301 in 1988 to 
179 last year average purity increased from 236 percent to 252 
percent compared with single digits a decade ago 
though the amount of heroin confiscated can fluctuate from year 
to year the trend recently has been toward much larger seizures 
from 1982 through 1987 the dea and customs service each 
confiscated 200 to 440 kilograms of heroin a year since 1988 the 
annual seizures have ranged from 279 to 829 kilos 
but even huge seizures didnt cause a ripple in the market 
heath said case activity is going up jimenez said 
quantities are going up in every seizure 
he rejected the notion that drug agents may simply be doing a 
better job 
this means more heroin is coming into the country jimenez 
said 
dr donald jasinsky who runs francis scott keys adult 
detoxification program suggested that there simply may be a lag 
between the influx of heroin and hospital and morgue cases 
you may have to have drug users using for awhile before 
you see an increase in public health and social problems 
jasinsky said

a policeman in the medellin cartels 
hometown goes to work each day with an assault rifle a bulletproof 
vest and a prayer the drug lords will pay 4300 to anyone who 
kills him 
so far this year more than 130 have been slain 
policemen say they live on nerve and in fear of being the next 
victim 
some routinely arrive home with pistol drawn in case an assassin 
lurks in the shadows dozens of of the victims were murdered while 
off duty 
police in medellin are part of a national force of 80000 men 
which is part of the military and under defense ministry 
jurisdiction 
the government which declared war on drug traffickers last 
year has sent 1800 reinforcements in recent weeks to augment the 
normal force of 2600 the killings continue at an average of one a 
day in this city of 3 million colombias secondlargest 
if the same percentage of police officers was killed in new york 
city which has a force of 26000 the total would surpass 1000 
an associated press reporter talked with 30 medellin policemen 
and accompanied seven on a patrol of a dangerous part of medellin 
an officer pointed out the spots where six comrades had been killed 
in the past two months 
i get scared out here one said i see a movement in the 
shadows or hear a motorcycle moving toward me and the hair stands 
up on the back of my neck i wonder if this is it i wonder if im 
the next victim 
none wanted his name used figuring it would be a death warrant 
highranking medellin police officials refused to be interviewed 
about the dangers their men face the patrolmen said the drug 
cartels tactics had caused 300 police resignations in three months 
and recruiting was difficult 
im ready to quit if i dont get a transfer out of here 
soon a 20yearold policeman said were just statistics 
he and the others said they were frightened and exhausted by 
working up to 18 hours six days a week but most said they would 
not quit 
you can die of hunger too a 12year veteran commented 
their families are destroyed along with the policemen an 
officers widow gets only half his 95 monthly salary as a pension 
said a spokesman for the national police in bogota 
three widows said they could not support their children on that 
my children dont get milk they dont get meat they dont 
know what eggs taste like ruth duque said when they get sick 
we just pray there isnt any money for medicine 
mrs duques situation is even worse because she gets no pension 
at all her husband was killed march 23 1988 before the pension 
law was passed 
she said she makes the equivalent of about 102 a month working 
in a drugstore she feeds her son and daughter aged 4 and 3 one 
meal a day of rice and beans 
colombias minimum wage equals about 100 a month a quart of 
milk costs 75 cents and a onepound loaf of bread 1 
unemployment is over 30 percent in medellin according to 
sociologists at the local university the government says the rate 
is 10 percent but doesnt count thousands of people who mow lawns 
work as sidewalk peddlers or have other parttime jobs 
ive been looking for a job ever since my husband was 
killed said socorro rua her husband was killed may 19 by a man 
who stuck a gun in his ribs on a crowded bus 
her 15yearold daughter liliana turned her head away and 
tears coursed down her cheeks mrs rua also has a 6yearold son 
carlos 
they live in an apartment complex built by the government for 
policemen the shabby threeroom apartment costs only 20 a month 
but even that may be out of reach because officials have told her 
the pension paperwork will take a year 
another widow carmen montoya said she had high hopes for their 
children when her husband was alive but now we just try to get 
by day to day my little boy wanted a toy car for his birthday i 
cried when he asked me because i knew i couldnt afford it they 
dont get anything at christmas 
my little girl used to chatter and sing all the time before 
her daddy was killed she said now she just stares and hardly 
says a word 
i asked the police department to pay for a psychologist to see 
her but they told me there is no money for that 
mrs montoya has two children lina 5 and alexander 3 she 
receives about 80 a month because her husband had 20 years on the 
force

conservatives led by chief justice william h 
rehnquist maintained their controlling grip on the supreme court in 
the 198990 term but defections in some key cases slowed the 
courts rightward march 
in the big cases with occasional forays off the reservation 
the conservatives still carried the day said american university 
law professor herman schwartz but when the liberals had control 
back in the 60s they didnt win them all either 
in the justcompleted term the court refused to let family 
members assert a right to die and end lifesustaining treatment 
for permanently comatose relatives whose wishes are not clearly 
known made it harder for girls under 18 to get abortions without 
notifying their parents allowed students to meet in public schools 
for prayer and worship and condoned police roadblocks to check for 
drunken drivers 
not all the decisions had such a conservative thrust 
the court enhanced federal judges power to supervise school 
desegregation efforts eviscerated the political patronage system 
upheld government affirmative action programs attacked as 
discriminatory against whites and struck down a federal law that 
banned flag burning 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy both 
conservative sided with three liberal justices to overturn the law 
banning flag burning justice byron r white another conservative 
joined four liberals in the affirmative action and the political 
patronage decisions 
its a precarious majority and disappointments occurred when 
one or another justice jumped off the conservative ship john 
scully of the conservative washington legal foundation said we 
definitely need the appointment of one more conservative justice to 
solidify our gains 
justice sandra day oconnor joins rehnquist scalia kennedy and 
white in the fivemember conservative majority 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens are the courts liberals 
blackmun in an interview in the terms waning days said the 
conservatives this year have control of the court completely and 
are making the most of it 
voting statistics for the term appear to confirm blackmuns 
perception 
in the 129 signed decisions the five conservatives cast a total 
of 83 dissenting votes while the four liberals cast 168 
one decision can yield in addition to a majority opinion 
several dissenting and concurring opinions 
of the 37 decisions reached by a 54 vote the 
conservativeliberal split held in 19 
some of the 54 rulings had no ideological heat schwartz 
said and there were a few significant crossovers 
if the court can be said to have an ideological center it is 
the domain of white oconnor blackmun and stevens who depending 
on the issue are most likely to leave the respective conservative 
or liberal camps 
here in summary form are the major decisions of the courts 
198990 term

the writer the aps southeast regional reporter 
based in atlanta followed nelson mandelas american tour through 
its first four cities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in harlem nelson mandela unleashed a river of cash 
and mandela wasnt even there the crowd of 100000 most of it 
black was waiting for the south africans arrival listening to a 
warmup speaker describe the needs of mandelas african national 
congress i dont want this man to leave here without a piece of 
you going with him he said 
suddenly hundreds of bills 1 5 10 were passed 
handtohand overhead coursing through the crowd to the speakers 
platform 
i would like to stand here and cry for a thousand years 
malcolm xs widow betty shabazz told the crowd 
it was a striking moment on 125th street but not an isolated 
one it was like that all along mandelas eightcity 11day tour 
of the united states which ends sunday black america has given 
mandela joyful tears and dollar bills and he has given them hope 
and pride and exultation 
at receptions and rallies from lamppost perches in harlem and 
corridors in the us capitol they spoke of an almost mystical 
aura a power from above said a 75yearold new yorker ormond 
duncan 
at the same time the 71yearold mandela was a kind of 
cheerleader for black america a badly needed one many said 
morale is enormously lifted said georgetown university law 
professor eleanor holmes norton after greeting mandela at 
washingtons national airport 
black businessmen at a wall street power breakfast and 
schoolkids in atlanta shared a wish that the stately steadfast 
south african would bring a better understanding of blacks and 
with it basic respect still withheld by some 
other people are going to look at black people especially 
black business owners differently said bill howell who runs a 
petroleum products company in brooklyn 
here said so many was a hero you could see and touch even cry 
over 
i just let it out said 23yearold bernard johnson who 
wept at the sight of mandela at a school rally in bostons largely 
black roxbury section which has considered seceding from the city 
and renaming itself for the antiapartheid leader 
a massachusetts legislator byron rushing sought to explain the 
powerful feelings some people consciously and i think almost 
everybody unconsciously is thinking this could have been in 
america that malcolm could have lived or that martin could have 
lived 
people wanted to reciprocate the gift of mandelas visit 
said coretta scott king the widow of the rev martin luther king 
jr who met privately with mandela in atlanta 
for him to actually come its like a dream that you had 
harbored in your bosom she said shortly after mandela arrived 
in the united states 
i would hope that most people of goodwill would see it as a 
triumph of good over evil but she added not an ultimate one 
because theres so many struggles left 
in the crowds that cheered mandela at every stop people talked 
of personal struggles and many said thats why theyd come they 
took time off work many traveled hours by bus ophelia abney of 
charlotte nc even rescheduled her husbands heart surgery so 
that she could attend an atlanta rally 
resting against the iron fence at the white house where mandela 
was meeting with president bush the rev robert craghead 58 put 
the occasion in a personal perspective 
i grew up in a segregated situation the back of the bus 
restricted places where blacks could fraternize he said 
as a young minister in rural virginia 30 years ago craghead 
worked to desegregate public schools to register black voters 
once he said he had to dissuade young black men from going home 
to get guns when klansmen harassed participants in a courthouse 
registration drive 
in the 1960s he marched wearing a sign that said simply i am 
a man and now waiting at the white house gate his sign bore 
mandelas picture and the legend freedom fighter 
ive seen tremendous change in my lifetime craghead said 
but ive also seen a regression in many areas 
perhaps he said mandelas visit will reenergize the civil 
rights movement in this country it can he said i dont 
know if it will 
yes it will insisted david jordan a mississippi delta 
activist buoyed by meeting mandela those of us whove been 
scratching the surface trying to make things better it does give 
us inspiration 
jordan president of the greenwood miss city council was a 
guest at a congressional black caucus breakfast with mandela 
invited by rep mike espy 
the first black elected since reconstruction to represent 
mississippi in congress espy knows washingtons famous and 
powerful meeting mandela however was on another level to 
listen to him to shake his hand to get his autograph 
after years of effort against statesponsored apartheid in 
mississippi to a great extent the barriers that we have to 
overcome now are less racial and more economic espy said 
calling mandela an inspiration a galvanizing figure 
in mandelas reverberating calls to keep the pressure on 
south africas government many black americans heard encouragement 
for efforts closer to home 
supporters of statehood for the district of columbia circulated 
petitions at mandela rallies there comparing their lack of 
representation with south african blacks i dont see a lot of 
difference said krys bailey 
roslyn bacon who climbed the base of a street lamp to cheer 
mandela in harlem said his visit should stimulate blacks toward 
action on local issues 
for example if you say keep the pressure on that means keep 
the pressure on the boycotters she said referring to a protest 
over a confrontation between a korean store owner and a haitian 
customer in brooklyn 
and if you dont make the connection said ms bacon a new 
york city schoolteacher then mr mandelas trip here doesnt 
mean anything 
for others working with kids in poor minority neighborhoods 
his appearance among them alone may make a difference 
in roxbury bernard johnson said some gang members helped with 
the school rally 
oh yeah they were inside and heard mandela urge them to 
stay in school to become leaders said johnson who works with a 
community group called free my people 
it will deter some of them some of em it wont some of em 
dont see the hope 
roaming the mobbed outfield of yankee stadium taking pictures 
two days earlier ricardo wright 30 said hed use the photos to 
convey the excitement and the message of the mandela rally to the 
kids in his varsity sports academy in the bronx 
the message you can fight for something he said you can 
believe in something it can come true

the anc has been criticized by some other south african groups 
for letting whites play too large a part others have called the 
group marxist and have faulted mandela for praising such leaders as 
muammar gadhafi of libya fidel castro of cuba and yasser arafat of 
the palestine liberation organization 
espy a democrat said mandela wants americans to understand 
that our enemies the enemies of the united states or so theyve 
been portrayed by some members of the administration are not the 
enemies of the anc and thats something that we have to 
understand 
he noted reports that a cia tip led to andelas arrest weve 
sort of been on the wrong side on a lot of these struggles and 
im glad to see now some moderation in our stance and some 
reflection of a legitimate struggle 
said mrs king i think that the anc today and as ive seen 
them over the last few years has enunciated a policy that they 
would like to negotiate they are talking about peaceful 
negotiations and a peaceful settlement 
as for mandela for tactical reasons i would assume he 
continues to talk about the armed struggle but then he goes on 
to explain what hes talking about and everything hes talking 
about is being achieved through peaceful means she said 
mandela represents not mindless violence but the ability 
to defend oneself said vicki rawls of atlanta standing in the 
crowd across the street from kings tomb 
martin luther king used weapons she said they werent 
artillery they used their bodies as weapons their minds when 
youre chased by dogs bitten and beaten youre using your body as 
a weapon 
standing in the same crowd under the same fierce sun richard 
smith raised a placard topped with a large peace symbol 
we have a double sometimes multiple standard when it comes 
to violence smith said there are people wholl tell you to be 
peaceful no matter what but while theyre telling you that theyre 
denying your rights denying you access 
will mandelas aura and message endure here like kings 
i bet its going to anchor in with people here a bit like the 
1963 march on washington said henry hampton who created the 
pbs television series on the civil rights movement eyes on the 
prize 
the us crusade encouraged south africans and mandelas visit 
to this country represents a closing of the circle he said 
when mandela and kings widow met irene morrison sensed that 
the circle was closing in other ways that the future and past of 
the civil rights movement were coming together 
she had escorted a group of high school students from newark 
nj to atlanta on a college tour under a program called upward 
bound 
i think dr king is here ms morrison said a part of him 
is here in all the people

lace is making a comeback as a fashion 
staple but it may be too late to save the industry in new england 
the painstaking tradition of making fine leavers lace is the 
most recent new england craft facing extinction a generation of 
weavers who honed their skills for decades are approaching 
retirement and mills cant find young workers willing to spend 
years learning the craft 
the latest victim is the deep river lace company which closes 
its doors today after 56 years in business 
its unfortunate its coming to an end the way it is said 
leo denette 70 one of the mills four owners who started as an 
apprentice weaver at deep river lace in 1941 six months before 
pearl harbor 
deep river lace was the last company in connecticut and one of a 
handful in the country making the intricate leavers lace perfected 
in nottingham england in the early 1800s 
it takes three years to learn to operate leavers looms and deep 
river lace could find no young people to take the place of its last 
five workers who are all in their late 60s or early 70s 
so the company is shutting down the last of its 16ton looms 
closing the doors of its red brick factory and becoming a part of 
new englands industrial past 
stanley jakiel 79 another deep river weaver and owner traced 
the mills decline to the casual fashion trends of the 1960s 
demand for lace fell then so the company never found the need to 
train new workers 
the lace business went over the falls when ladies started 
wearing jeans he says 
lacemaking survives in the united states today but it has 
moved south and adopted modern technology a type of cloth called 
rachel lace is produced on machines that take only two or three 
months to master 
but jakiel say leavers lace is more intricate and better quality 
than the cheaper rachel variety 
it really takes 20 years before you know what youre doing 
said jakiel who has been in the lace business for 60 years its 
all experience theres no book on this 
the huge leavers machines stand 9 feet 6 inches tall and are of 
a design essentially unchanged from the prototype built by john 
leavers an english lace worker in 1813 
each loom contains 4600 bobbins which have to be threaded 
individually with thread as fine as a strand of hair the threads 
are woven into lace by the rocking bobbins and metal bars that 
determine the pattern 
only about 150 leavers looms are still in use in the united 
states compared with 800 in the late 1940s and early 1950s said 
john w hughes manager of the textile engineering division of 
bridgeportbased american fabrics co 
more will fall silent when rhode island lace works in great 
barrington ri closes its doors in august 
hughes helped build two of deep river laces cast iron looms 
more than 30 years ago when he was an apprentice in nottingham 
today he brokers the sale of old machines like the four deep 
river lace looms that already have been shipped to mills in calais 
france 
hughes says the craft is alive and well in europe and japan 
where apprentices are eager to learn how to operate the complicated 
looms and designers are placing big orders 
lace is the hottest item in fashion right now says lita 
konde a professor at the fashion institute of technology in new 
york city 
today the european lace houses cant even keep their orders 
filled she said the dress designers are using it everything 
from cocktail and evening wear to swimsuits 
france has always been the leader in lace production and french 
fashion houses like christian dior and yves st laurent have 
incorporated the fabric into their spring and fall lines konde 
said 
but the latest fashion craze wont benefit deep river lace the 
owners only hope now is to preserve the mill as a museum 
certain oldfashioned values should not be forgotten said 
charlotte d boline who is trying to sell the mill to the state as 
a museum the traditions of new england should be carried on so 
our children can see how things were done

verbal sniping between the federal agencies 
that oversee the securities and futures markets is heating up again 
commodity futures trading commission chairman wendy gramm says a 
study by the rival securities and exchange commission on last 
octobers 190point stock market plunge is misleading and 
imprecise 
sec chairman richard c breeden says the cftcs study of the 
1989 market minicrash had significant methodological defects 
he also likened it to saying except for the period of time 
between 7 am and noon pearl harbor day was a good day 
we stand by our report and every word in it breeden told a 
small group of reporters thursday 
his sharp comments came in response to a letter gramm sent to 
the chairman of a house subcommittee that oversees the cftc 
both the sec which regulates stocks bonds and the exchanges 
that trade them and the cftc which oversees the futures markets 
have been locked in a war of words over which agency has 
jurisdiction over financial products that share aspects of both 
securities and futures contracts 
the bush administration is pushing legislation that would strip 
the cftc of authority over stock index futures and give it to the 
sec 
in the wake of a 190point plunge in the dow jones industrial 
average a key market indicator last fall both regulatory 
agencies studied the causes of the trading slide which occurred 
shortly after ual corp announced financing for a managementled 
leveraged buyout had fallen through 
last month both agencies released their reports the cftc 
concluded that index arbitrage a computerized program trading 
strategy blamed by many for exacerbating the 1987 stock market 
crash was not a major factor in the stock slide 
it also found no evidence of stock index futures market 
manipulation 
stock index futures often used in program trading strategies by 
large institutional investors like pension funds let investors 
trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without having to buy 
the underlying stocks 
the sec and other critics of index arbitrage claim it causes 
wild price swings or volatility index arbitragers try to take 
advantage of small price differences between the stock and futures 
markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while 
selling in the other 
the sec study released last month found that index arbitrage and 
other program trading strategies accelerated the 69 percent market 
drop an unusually high percentage of volume during the 90minute 
slide was conducted through computerprogram trading the sec study 
concluded 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the panel that oversees 
the cftc asked gramm to explain the discrepencies between the sec 
and cftc reports 
in a ninepage letter to english gramm said the two reports 
agree on most of the facts the secs report is misleading because 
it leaves some critical information out of its analysis 
the most obvious case is their emphasis on sell volume and 
only perfunctory mention of contemporaneous buy volume by the same 
trader groups gramm said 
breeden however insisted the sec report was more accurate 
because it focuses on the days trading after the ual announcement 
also breeden said the sec report looks at the pattern of net 
activities both buying and selling 
the cftc report chose to analyze the level of index arbitrage 
averaged over the entire day thats a little bit like saying that 
except for the period of time between 7 am and noon pear harbor 
day was a good day and on average there werent many problems 
breeden continued there was a specific event it began at a 
specific point in time and to try and disguise the developments 
that occurred during that period of time by averaging them in over 
a period of time that is totally irrelevent demonstrates the 
significant methodological defects of the cftc report

the jury deciding the fate of former wall street 
pro john a mulheren jr got the same request from prosecution and 
defense lawyers believe my witness 
the language the two sides chose to convey that message was 
slightly different 
in measured tones assistant us attorney alfred pavlis said 
mulheren had greater motive to lie than the governments main 
witness convicted felon ivan boesky who already has served prison 
time 
in an often fiery threehour summation thursday mulherens 
lawyer thomas puccio called boesky a pile of human garbage 
boeskys testimony was a sick joke the admitted inside trader 
is the most incredible witness whos ever taken the stand in this 
country 
he has lied so many times that he doesnt even remember how 
many times hes lied puccio said 
the attack on boeskys credibility was puccios main tactic 
throughout the trial in us district court in manhattan now in 
its seventh week the defense maintains boesky lied partly because 
he agreed to cooperate with the government partly because its his 
nature 
mulheren 41 is charged with 30 counts of conspiracy 
securities and mail fraud and keeping false books and records in 
connection with allegedly illegal securities transactions with 
boesky in 1985 and 1986 
the case expected to go to the jury today centers on 
allegations that mulheren manipulated the price of gulf amp western 
inc stock and concealed the ownership of other securities to help 
boesky cheat on his taxes and evade federal securities laws in 1985 
and 1986 
pavlis on wednesday portrayed mulheren and boesky as close 
friends and colleagues who schemed to break the law puccio said 
none of the trades mulheren executed with boesky were illegal 
puccio denied existence of a criminal conspiracy saying 
mulherens firm even lost 50000 on one series of trades with 
boesky indicating it was fully at risk to the whims of the market 
puccio cited the testimony by a parade of defense and some 
government witnesses who praised mulherens honesty and integrity 
and then compared that with boeskys reputation 
during his crossexamination of boesky last month puccio had 
the onetime stock speculator admit he lied to government 
prosecutors and paid for inside information with cashfilled 
suitcases 
puccio attacked the deal under which boesky pleaded guilty to 
one count of lying to the securities and exchange commission and 
paid 100 million in cash and securities to settle his charges he 
was released after serving two years of a threeyear sentence 
mulheren is the first of several prominent wall street 
professionals implicated by boesky to take his case to trial 
others involved in the governments fouryearold investigation 
have pleaded guilty receiving sentences ranging from probation to 
four years in prison 
mulheren had close dealings with boesky for several years at 
one point helping boeskys firm avoid insolvency boesky later 
named mulheren as a trustee for his children which the government 
has sought to use as evidence of their close ties 
but the relationship between the men soured after boeskys plea 
deal was announced in november 1986 in 1988 after learning that 
boesky had implicated him in wrongdoing mulheren was arrested 
carrying an assault weapon supposedly on his way to shoot boesky 
mulherens lawyers have said the incident was related to 
mulherens condition as a manic depressive the incident was not 
revealed to the jury at mulherens trial 
mulheren testified in his own defense and denied any wrongdoing 
also charged is leonard destefano 34 a former trader at 
mulherens firm jamie securities co he is accused of conspiracy 
and recordkeeping violations for allegedly inflating payments to 
boesky to pay back profits from the alleged illegal deals 
both men face up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine on 
each count

copyright protection on lotus development corps 
popular 123 software extends beyond the computer programs 
innerworkings to keyboard commands and onscreen images that 
confront the user a federal judge has ruled 
a spokesman for paperback software international which lost the 
case along with subcontractor stephenson software ltd said the 
company would appeal thursdays decision 
if the decision is upheld in an appeal it will have a 
serious affect on the software business michael burdick 
paperback vice president of sales and marketing said he would not 
comment on specifics of the lengthy ruling 
the decision could make it more difficult for programmers to 
create software competitive with successful programs a lawyer not 
involved with the case said 
in the future if theres a product that becomes the accepted 
product in the industry it will be very difficult to create a 
program that competes with it without being willing to retrain 
users extensively jack russo a palo alto calif copyright 
lawyer told the new york times in reacting to the decision 
in his 115page decision us district judge robert keeton 
wrote that the user interface of 123 is its most unique element 
and is the aspect that has made 123 so popular that defendants 
went to such trouble to copy that element is a testament to its 
substantiality 
the attorney for lotus praised the decision 
in bringing this case we sought to protect the original 
creative expression that is a very large part of what people value 
in our product said tom lemberg vice president and general 
counsel of cambridgebased lotus 
during the nonjury trial which began in early february lotus 
product managers displayed three video screens to show the 
similarities in commands among paperback softwares vpplanner and 
mosaics twin classic program 
because the attorney representing mosaic fell ill during the 
trial keeton chose to concentrate only on paperback software as 
the defendant it was not immediately clear thursday if the ruling 
would also apply to mosaic 
defense attorneys had argued that the lotus commands represented 
instructions for a machine rather than the expression of an 
idea 
the ruling would not affect programs that have different screen 
images and keyboard commands like microsofts excel software 
lotus executives said 
lotus officials also said the ruling would not affect companies 
that publish programs that are compatable with lotus files the 
company has no intention of trying to claim copyright infringement 
over compatable files officials said

the communitys image is probably the best its been in 100 
years city planner ray forgianni jr said the closing was 
almost like a catalyst the handwriting was on the wall the 
economy needed to diversify 
this city of 77000 on lake michigan has erased many of the 
bitter memories of the december 1988 closing 
among the planned or already opened new facilities a 
multimilliondollar recreation marina taking shape just beyond the 
plants lakefront site a 45 million greyhound race track a food 
company warehouse and a navy research center 
john bechler director of the kenosha area development corp 
said some 15 manufacturing companies either opened or announced 
plans to do so in the past 12 months the openings will mean about 
1350 jobs he said 
but hundreds of former chrysler workers remain unemployed and 
many new jobs do not pay the same high wages and benefits 
autoworkers enjoyed for decades 
ron danowski a state labor department spokesman said the 
average wage at chrysler was 1422 former plant workers are now 
averaging 1018 he said 
about 3250 workers sought jobplacement assistance or job 
training through union programs said jack ward state coordinator 
for the uaw job development training corp about 1200 are employed 
and an additional 650 are in school or retraining programs he said 
not everyone therefore will celebrate the smokestack 
destruction 
for all the people who got screwed out of their jobs its a 
very sad day said rudy kuzel president of united auto workers 
local 72 despite all their hoopla about economic development 
they havent begun to do anything to help the people who lost their 
jobs 
the plant was bought in 1917 by nash motors predecesor of the 
american motors corp at its height in the early 1960s it employed 
more than 16000 
chrysler acquired the plant when it bought amc in 1987 and 
chrysler offiials implied they would keep it open for at least five 
years the aging plant was too inefficient however and it was 
closed 
chrysler which employs 1100 workers at another plant here 
provided a 25 million trust fund for displaced workers and offered 
to give the empty buildings to the city chrysler agreed to level 
the complex after the city declined

the dawn of a united german economy with a 
common currency holds out hope to millions of east germans and a 
challenge to the rest of the world 
sundays economic and monetary union of the two germanies should 
give a big growth spurt to what is already the thirdlargest 
capitalist economy in the world and the powerhouse of europe 
east germany brings to the union more than 16 million consumers 
an educated work force and a gateway to other eastern european 
countries that are turning to the west for help in shedding more 
than 40 years of socialism 
germany longterm is one of the most attractive markets i can 
think of in the 1990s says heiko thieme an analyst at deutsche 
bank capital corp 
therein lies the challenge 
germany rivals japan as the biggest surplus country its export 
earnings have been a critical source of capital for the world 
economy especially debtors like the united states 
now the money will be needed at home to overhaul roads 
factories and the social welfare network in the east increased 
german borrowing to meet those needs will drive up interest rates 
at home and a sharp reduction in german capital exports could mean 
higher rates around the globe 
david hale chief economist at kemper financial services inc 
estimates that upgrading east germanys public infrastructure alone 
could cost 400 billion to 500 billion getting the countrys 
manufacturing and service industries into competitive shape could 
cost even more he says 
the diversion of german excess savings from london paris and 
new york to rebuilding the east will increase the world level of 
interest rates not just german borrowing costs hale says 
longterm german interest rates already have reacted to the 
expected surge in borrowing they rose as high as 9 percent this 
spring from 7 percent when the berlin wall fell 
although they have eased slightly to around 8 percent german 
rates remain above us rates currently ranging around 8 percent 
for the first time in more than a decade 
that trend could persist says nicholas sargen international 
fixedincome analyst at salomon brothers 
german rates are likely to remain in the 9 percent region while 
us long rates ease toward 8 percent later this year because of 
the economys weakness he predicts if it werent for the 
increased competition from germany for capital us rates probably 
would fall another half percentage point he says 
reunification heralds a seachange in global finance in the 
1990s just as the reagan revolution of the 1980s transformed the 
united states from the worlds biggest creditor into its biggest 
debtor sargen says 
the big us budget deficits helped fuel the longest peacetime 
boom in history in contrast europe in the 1980s was marked by 
sluggish growth and relatively high unemployment spawning the term 
eurosclerosis 
todays europe stands to be revitalized by german reunification 
the transformation of other eastern european economies and the 
creation of a single market in western europe in 1992 he says the 
debthobbled us economy however has turned sluggish 
europe and the united states basically traded positions 
sargen said europe becomes the most exciting part of the world 
deutsche banks thieme also sees better growth prospects for 
germany but he believes concerns about higher interest rates are 
misplaced 
thieme says german rates reflect a fear that swapping the bulk 
of east germanys almost worthless ost marks for west germanys 
strong deutsche mark will fan inflation thats not likely because 
the bundesbank west germanys central bank is keeping monetary 
policy tight he says 
whats more east german labor costs are low and should help 
restrain inflation while boosting growth thieme says 
the unification is less inflationary interest rates will come 
down worldwide he says 
how should the united states compete with the new german 
juggernaut by imitation thieme says 
mexico he says is the uss east germany a freetrade 
agreement with mexico would give the united states access to a 
market several times larger than east germanys and with labor 
costs that are even lower he says

some 60000 labor federation 
members threatened to strike today if us banana giant chiquita 
brands international inc did not answer its workers wage hike 
demands 
chiquitas 10000 union employees who are members of the 
federation struck for a 60 percent salary increase on thursday 
paralyzing operations 
the president of the national legislature rodolfo irias navas 
said the labor unrest could destabilize honduras the poorest 
nation in the hemisphere after haiti with an annual per capita 
income of only 740 
the crisis created by unionism is putting the stability of the 
government in danger he said in a telephone interview 
workers at chiquita make an average 1532 a day and have not 
had a raise for six years while inflation has climbed at 50 
percent annually 
their union asked the company for a higher pay in october its 
members include banana cutters railway workers and administrative 
personnel 
company officials calculated the raise would cost 46 million a 
year and had not made a counterproposal thursday after four days of 
negotiating 
the strike is illegal it doesnt make sense we arent going 
to pay higher salaries to our workers chiquita vice president 
eduardo aragon said in a telephone interview 
company officials refused to comment further on the strike 
the federation to which the union belongs said members of other 
unions would begin walking off their job today beginning with 
2000 texaco refinery workers the refinery supplies the entire 
nation 
bananas are honduras leading export and the cincinnatibased 
chiquita formerly united brands is one of the most powerful 
institutions in this nation of 48 million people 
other labor groups including the 600000member workers 
confederation have said they will strike if chiquita refuses to 
negotiate 
president rafael leonardo callejas was trying thursday to stop 
the strike from spreading 
he sent a highlevel delegation to the northern coastal town of 
la lima headquarters of chiquita to mediate talks between union 
and company officials he also kept in close telephone contact with 
union leaders military officials and key advisers 
callejas said he was sympathetic to the strikers calling their 
demands for higher pay just but he said there was no need for a 
strike 
the unions are a fundamental piece of our democratic 
process he told the associated press in a phone interview but 
with me there is no need to strike because the unions can achieve 
their goals through dialogue without resorting to force 
the strike is the latest and potentially most serious labor 
unrest to hit callejas 5monthold administration 
about 4000 health care workers have been on strike since june 
11 to protest the privatization of support services in six of the 
nations 19 public hospitals 
the honduran private enterprise council aligned itself thursday 
with chiquita 
the strike is illegal said the councils president richard 
zablah the government has to decide if we live in a regime of 
law or of anarchy 
chiquita which owns the countrys only railroad has enjoyed a 
near monopoly on the banana business here since 1912 it currently 
controls 60 percent of the bananas exported from honduras 
usbased castle and cook controls the other 40 percent 
the 70000member national federation of workers unions 
honduras most powerful labor federation includes the banana union 
and the refinery union among its 54 individual unions 
although most of the major labor groups in honduras proclaimed 
their solidarity with the federation the head of the 30000member 
workers general central felicito avila said his people would not 
join a sympathy strike 
he said the current wave of labor unrest was creating a 
dangerously unstable climate and urged the company to negotiate 
with the union

a planned nationwide protest by canadian 
truckers fizzled today when just six dozen trucks quietly lined 
roads at three border crossings into the united states 
the planned blockade was to be the second demonstration in five 
weeks over high taxes and government policies the truckers say 
threaten their livelihood 
about 45 truckers brought their rigs to a halt at the ambassador 
bridge between detroit and windsor but police said the trucks were 
off to the side and were not blocking regular traffic 
a brief scuffle broke out at 130 am between protesters and 
two american truck drivers who tried to cross the border but 
police stepped in and restored order 
there is nowhere near the number we had last time said 
windsor police staff sgt joseph monteleone theyre just sitting 
there off to one side cars can still get back and forth 
if the protest doesnt pick up steam i would expect a lot of 
the truckers will go home 
the drivers say they are losing work to us truckers who pay 
less for fuel and have lower taxes and insurance costs 
the canadian transit company which owns the ambassador bridge 
is considering applying for an injunction that would declare the 
work stoppage illegal and send the truckers on their way 
meanwhile about 24 trucks parked along the peace bridge between 
fort erie ontario and buffalo ny shortly after midnight 
theyve been coming and going all night said customs 
official rick wellman there are a few on each side of the 
bridge and theyre asking others to join them 
another four trucks showed up at the queenstonlewiston bridge 
in queenston ontario by about 9 am police said 
despite the truckers call for a nationwide border protest no 
other blockades were reported along the 4000mile uscanadian 
frontier 
canadian transport minister doug lewis met with nonunion 
truckers in ottawa on wednesday and later met with three union 
leaders representing 150000 unionized truckers 
the union leaders agreed to participate with federal and 
provincial governments and industry leaders in a study of the 
problems facing the industry but wayne whitney a leader of the 
nonunion truckers refused to take part because the study wont be 
complete until august 
these truckers dont have that kind of time he said 
whitney said lewis rejected demands for a reduction in the fuel 
tax a fiveyear tax exemption on new and used equipment and a 
shorter depreciation period on rigs for tax purposes

president bush said today he jettisoned his 
nonewtaxes campaign pledge in hopes of reaching an accord with 
the democratcontrolled congress on a plan to reduce the deficit 
and reinvigorate a sluggish economy 
i knew id catch some flak on this decision said bush who 
has been sharply criticized by many lawmakers in his own republican 
party but ive got to do what i think is right 
speaking at a white house news conference bush said budget 
talks with congressional leaders are a make or break effort at 
responsible government he said the negotiations are going well 
and expressed hope there could be an agreement within a few weeks 
bush won the white house in 1988 by campaigning as an ardent foe 
of new taxes read my lips no new taxes was the most 
memorable line of his successful drive for the presidency 
but the president today likened himself to abraham lincoln 
ill think anew he said when faced with a deficit he said was 
worse than any of us visualized when he made his plegde 
republican congressmen have made it clear they feel betrayed by 
the presidents reversal on a winning campaign issue 
arrows have been flying back front sideways but thats 
what i get paid for he said i can totally empathize with what 
theyre going through 
bushs declaration earlier this week that tax revenue 
increases were an essential element of any deficitreduction 
package jumpstarted budget negotiations with congress 
the president spoke shortly before leaving for a brief vacation 
at kennebunkport maine next week he travels to london for a 
meeting with nato leaders then on to houston for the annual 
economic summit of industrialized nations 
asked about a western package of economic aid for the soviet 
union bush cited the difficulties we have with such a 
proposal there has got to be economic reform there all kinds 
of changes i believe soviet president mikhail s gorbachev wants 
to see take place but they have to be in place in order for aid to 
go forward 
the president also defended his son neil whose connections with 
a failed colorado savings and loan have come under scrutiny by 
federal regulators and congressional investigators i have what 
dad wouldnt full confidence in the integrity and honor of my 
son he said 
the news conference was dominated by questions about the 
volatile tax issue 
if i had control of this congress both houses we might not 
even be talking about this today he said 
without a deficitreduction agreement bush said automatic 
spending cuts totaling 100 billion could take effect oct 1 with 
draconian reductions in defense and domestic programs such as 
student loans 
the deficit for next year could total 150 billion not counting 
the cost of cleaning up failed sampls 
in accepting the republican president nomination in 1988 bush 
said 
and im the one who will not raise taxes my opponent 
wont rule out raising taxes but i will 
and the congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no 
and theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again and ill 
say to them read my lips no new taxes 
bush was asked how he could have made his notax pledge in 1988 
when the deficit was already at record levels the budget deficit 
is bigger far bigger i thought i could do a better job of getting 
spending down he said 
bush refused repeatedly to discuss specific tax increases 
im not saying whats on or off he replied when asked 
whether he would consider an income tax rate increase 
i have got strongly held preferences that people are familiar 
with he said more important than my posturing or protecting 
from arrows coming from one direction or another is getting a deal 
that is fair and good for the american people 
bushs decision earlier this week was embraced by congressional 
democrats but sharply criticized by many republican members of 
congress 
since bush issued his statement negotiators have said their 
talks have gone well although few details of the negotiations have 
been disclosed 
democrats have proposed cuts in the 1991 defense budget five 
times greater than bushs original proposal the two sides also 
have discussed cuts in politically popular benefit programs such as 
medicare and social security accordin to officials involved in the 
talks

president bush promised today not to interfere 
in thrift regulators investigation of his son neils involvement 
with a failed savings and loan in colorado 
citing the thrift crisis as a key reason for his willingness to 
consider new taxes bush also renewed his pledge to pursue 
vigorously invidivuals guilty of defrauding sampls 
my interest is to protect the depositor put the people 
that broke the law in jail the size of the savings and loan 
problem is terrible and we are trying very hard to go after the 
criminals and to have in place rules and regulations so that this 
will never happen again he said 
the president offered a warm personal assessment of his 
34yearold son he described neil bush as probably the most 
sensitive of the four boys maybe the second most sensitive and 
expressed full confidence in the integrity and honor of my son 
i will stay out of anything to do with the investigation but 
this is a fine young man he told reporters at a white house news 
conference 
im convinced that if hes done something wrong the system 
will so state if he hasnt i hope its fair enough to say hey 
the boy did nothing wrong bush said the system is going 
to work whether its the presidents son or somebody else 
the president also challenged those that allege misconduct 
to speak up and say what it is 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision which is 
pursuing administrative sanctions against the younger bush has so 
far refused to release its charges against him 
some members of the house banking committee have accused him of 
having a conflict of interest while serving from 1985 to 1988 as a 
board member of silverado banking savings and loan association 
denver the sampl which collapsed at a cost of 1 billion to 
taxpayers made loans to several of his business partners which 
were not repaid 
meanwhile members of congress prodded by angry taxpayers are 
moving swiftly to give the president even more money than he wants 
to pursue savings and loan crooks 
the house banking subcommittee on financial institutions voted 
450 thursday to endorse legislation authorizing spending of 152 
million a year in 1991 and 1992 up from 50 million this year 
subcommittee passage came less than a week after bush announced 
at a campaignstyle appearance at the justice department that he 
would seek 100 million 
however democrats immediately branded that amount as too 
little too late pointing out that the fbi has said it needs 
another 200 agents and the justice department another 100 attorneys 
assistant attorney general edward sg dennis jr testifying 
before the vote refused to endorse the higher amount but he 
assured members we can spend it responsibly republicans went 
along with the higher amount 
the legislation also would make it easier for the government to 
prosecute sampl fraud and recover swindled money 
meeting beneath a huge banner reading put the sampl crooks in 
jail several panel members said they noticed growing anger among 
taxpayers about the thrift mess 
this is an election year annunzio warned if you have 
a challenger he is going to try to make an issue of the sampl 
scandal he is going to try to paint you with a brush we all are 
in that same position 
republicans noted that the banner had temporarily displaced a 
portrait of fernand j st germain dri former chairman of the 
house banking committee st germain was defeated for reelection in 
1988 amid allegations that he improperly benefited from investments 
arranged by savings and loan interests 
dennis who announced thursday he was leaving as head of the 
justice departments criminal division to join a philadelphia law 
firm defended the administrations antifraud effort he noted 
that since 1987 it has convicted 52 sampl defendants in the dallas 
area alone he said 530 failed institutions are under 
investigation up from 206 in 1986 
rep stephen neal dnc countered that the department has 
received more than 21000 referrals of suspected fraud cases 
which are just lying there 
one provision of the legislation sent to the full banking 
committee would require the justice department to investigate half 
of the cases by the end of this year and all of them by the end of 
1991 
other provisions would 
create a new federal crime concealing assets from banking 
regulators 
authorize prosecutors to seek courtapproved wiretaps to 
investigate bank fraud 
allow regulators to undo personal asset transfers by 
whitecollar criminals trying to avoid liability for abuses at 
financial institutions 
permit regulators to revoke or limit golden parachute 
contracts that provide lucrative severance packages to executives 
of failed institutions 
give courts power to appoint a trustee to oversee the assets of 
individuals accused of fraud that is aimed at preventing them from 
dissipating the money before a judge can order them to repay the 
government 
prevent bankruptcy courts from discharging debts owed to the 
government by individuals who caused financial institution losses 
in fraud cases override state laws that allow individuals just saying 
whats what we my 
you know whats everythings on the table we may have to do 
something here and but if i were going to go back and say do 
it my way wed figure out a way that would be somewhat less 
controversial than this approach has been 
more

congressional and white house budget 
negotiators resumed bargaining today in what president bush 
described as a make or break effort to reduce the deficit 
in a 40minute news conference bush told reporters the 
negotiations are going well and expressed hope there could be an 
agreement within a few weeks things are moving he said 
the president defended his remarks tuesday that tax revenue 
increases were needed to reduce the deficit saying what i 
consider it is a necessary step to get stalled budget negotiations 
moving 
bush called the talks with congressional leaders a make or 
break effort at responsible government 
he spoke a day after democratic budget negotiators suggested 
dramatic cuts in pentagon spending that would be more than five 
times deeper than the reductions bush prefers 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta offered a plan on 
thursday to limit the 1991 defense budget to about 290 billion no 
decisions were made at the budget summit which resumes today 
the plan would cut defense spending next year 16 billion below 
what it would need to keep pace with inflation the 1991 budget 
bush presented in january cut military expenditures by 3 billion 
were convinced the situation in eastern europe is continuing 
to move in a progressive way toward peace argued panetta 
dcalif after thursdays bargaining session between congressional 
leaders and administration officials in addition the deficit 
situation is spinning out of control 
republicans said the cut would be much too deep 
i truly believe it is way too draconian and cant be 
achieved said a gop negotiator sen pete domenici of new mexico 
the reduction would surpass the 13 billion in defense cuts 
approved last month by the senate budget committee and the 115 
billion in military reductions passed by the house 
panetta said that to achieve the suggested savings he would 
rely more heavily on cuts in weapons systems pentagon management 
and other overhead and combat readiness than the administration 
prefers 
as they were discussing defense cuts budget negotiators from 
the bush admiistration and congress received added pressure 
thursday in the form of a warning from treasury secretary nicholas 
brady 
in a letter to congressional leaders brady warned that the 
governments authority to borrow money will have to be renewed 
before lawmakers recess for their august break 
the federal debt is currently about 31 trillion the 
government expects to spend about 176 billion this year on 
interest payments on that borrowing about 17 percent of the 
federal budget 
legislation extending the governments borrowing authority 
though routine must be passed because the alternative is a 
firsttime ever government default 
the measure is considered an excellent vehicle to which any 
budget pact could be attached thereby making it difficult for 
members to vote against negotiators would like to finish their 
work in time to attach it to the debt limit bill

the company urged owners to carefully monitor oil levels in the 
meantime as described in owners manuals of sixcylinder models 
and in special booklets mailed last fall to owners of fourcylinder 
models 
owners should have the cars checked immediately if they notice 
overheating vibration or power loss harris said 
in 1987 gm recalled 125000 fourcylinder fieros produced in 
the 1984 model year for alterations that included boosting oil 
capacity to four quarts from three the company also urged owners 
to check the engine oil every time they bought gas

soybean futures prices surged this morning on the 
chicago board of trade amid active buying in reaction to a 
reduction in the agriculture departments estimate of soybean 
planted acreage 
corn and wheat futures were mostly lower in early trading 
in a report released after thursdays close of the market the 
usda pegged soybean plantings at 58 million acres about 14 
million acres below the agencys march projection and 16 acres 
below trade expectations 
the usda also lowered its corn acreage estimate by 200000 acres 
to a higherthanexpected 746 million reflecting planting delays 
caused by heavy spring rains in the midwest 
many analysts had expected a corresponding increase in soybean 
acres to show that some farmers unable to plant corn switched to 
soybeans 
william biedermann research director with the futures brokerage 
allendale inc said the reports underlying survey which was 
conducted during the first two weeks of june might have been done 
too early to reflect the expected shift from corn to soybeans 
at any rate he said crop production ultimately will depend on 
weather more than plantings 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 2 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in july at 328 a bushel corn 
futures were 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with july at 293 
a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with july at 
135 a bushel soybeans were 9 cents to 11 cents higher with 
july at 617 a bushel 
cattle futures were lower but pork futures were higher in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 03 cent to 20 cent lower with august at 7297 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 12 cent to 35 cent lower with 
august at 8407 cents a pound live hogs were 02 cent to 18 cent 
higher with july at 6067 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
30 cent lower to 55 cent higher with july at 5950 cents a pound

president bush today vetoed a bill that would 
guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks unpaid leave for childbirth 
adoption or family illness 
i strongly object to the federal government mandating 
leave policies for americas employers and work force bush said 
setting the stage for a major confrontation with congress 
in a written statement before leaving for a vacation bush said 
parental leave is an important benefit for employers to offer 
workers however he said we must insure that federal policies 
do not stifle the creation of new jobs nor result in the 
elimination of existing jobs 
the issue of parental leave is a politically charged one the 
republican sponsor of the bill that bush vetoed rep marge roukema 
of new jersey has said it is a bedrock family issue that could 
backfire on republicans 
in vetoing the bill bush said america faces its stiffest 
economic competition ever 
if our nations employers are to succeed in an increasingly 
complex and competitive global marketplace they must have the 
felxibility to meet both this challenge and the needs of their 
employees he said 
judith lichtman president of the womens legal defense fund and 
head of a coalition of groups that lobbied for the bill said 
im stunned by the cynicism that this veto reveals president 
bush doesnt care about american families he really only cares 
about big business 
it was bushs 13th veto to date congress has not been able to 
muster enough votes to override him 
the bill passed comfortably in the house although the margin 
fell 46 votes short of the twothirds majority that would be needed 
to override a veto 
senate passage came without a recorded vote sponsor christopher 
dodd dconn said he was within two or three votes of a 
twothirds majority 
the new legislation would require business and government 
employers to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical 
leave or with leave so they could care for a newly born or adopted 
child or an ill child parent or spouse 
employers would have to continue health coverage and then 
restore a returning employee to his or her previous job or an 
equivalent position 
ms lichtman said bush seemed to support such family leave 
provisions during his presidential campaign 
i held out hope he meant what he said in the campaign and he 
really did want to do something she said 
she said supporters still hoped they could muster the required 
votes in the house to override bushs veto

the state oil monopoly petroleos de 
venezuela sa said friday it was obeying opec quotas but did not 
explicitly deny reports that it was pressing the government to take 
venezuela out of opec 
pdvsa complies and will continue to comply at all times with 
the guidelines of oil policy laid down or that will be laid down 
by the national government said a fiveline statement faxed to 
the associated press 
the daily el nacional newspaper reported friday that pdvsa wants 
venezuela to leave the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
officials of the government party democratic action confirmed 
to the ap that pdvsa president andres sosa pietri met with the 
partys excutive national committee tuesday and told them that opec 
quotas were against venezuelas best interests 
at the meeting sosa pietri said there was no reason why 
venezuela should continue to follow opec since other cartel members 
were flouting them openly according to the sources who asked to 
remain anonymous 
so far there have been no comments from the energy and mines 
ministry 
both venezuelan president carlos andres perez and energy 
minister celestino armas are staunch opec supporters 
but pdvsa executives have been chafing under opec quotas for 
months complaining that they hamper the venezuelan oil industrys 
expansion increasingly pdvsa executives have said sometimes not 
so privately that venezuela should not respect quotas if other 
opec members are openly violating them

interest rates

expand its plant here a university of north florida researcher 
says 
maxwell house is part of the star of the crown of the citys 
economic base louis woods associate professor of economics and

congress is considering a resolution that would 
direct the federal reserve to reduce inflation gradually to zero 
but says a critic there is a major defect in the effort 
the defect says richard w rahn is that the resolution would 
so to speak appoint the fox to guard the chicken coop the federal 
reserve he says is the cause of inflation not its cure 
rahn doesnt equivocate to him the issue is clear the 
central bank and only the central bank causes inflation and as 
you probably know the fed is the central bank of the united states 
you might perceive something convoluted in such thinking but 
oddly says critic rahn the convoluted thinking is the 
conventional thinking 
the whole notion that the central bank should be the economys 
designated inflation fighter has the world upside down says 
rahn whose professional position might suggest he is a defender 
rather than critic of convention 
rahn is vice president and chief economist of the us chamber 
of commerce 
in testimony on house joint resolution 409 to establish price 
stability as a national objective rahn instructed congress that 
the nation has a fiat money system controlled by government and 
outside the control of the rule of law 
government he said retains a monopoly over money by spending 
it and then forcing the fed to accommodate the spending by 
manipulating the money supply and attempting to keep it from 
inflating the market economy 
i believe that as long as the government maintains a monopoly 
over money and relies on an unaccountable government central bank 
to manage that monopoly inflation will persist he told members 
of congress 
in seeking to accommodate that government spending he said the 
fed whipsaws the economy between inflation and recession rather 
than pursuing a longterm policy consistent with stable economic 
growth 
sustained inflation is always a monetary phenomenon and 
trends in the real economy when divorced from changes in monetary 
growth have little bearing on past present and future 
inflation he said 
in short if government kept spending in check and if the fed 
didnt feel compelled to accomodate that spending thered be no 
inflation 
you could detect additional outrage in rahns testimony fed 
board members he remarked are political appointees who once 
appointed are left unaccountable for their decisions when they 
testify before congress he said they are sometimes purposely 
vague even given to misinformation 
in economics statistics speak the wholesale price index rahn 
said stayed generally level from 1795 to 1913 then what happened 
in that year the federal reserve was established 
from then until 1951 when the fed became fully independent the 
rate doubled by last year said rahn the rate had increased 
ninefold from 1913 
the fact of the matter said rahn is that monetary policy 
call it fed policy cannot offset finetune counterbalance or 
reserve the adverse economic effects of improper fiscal and 
regulatory policy 
if congress spends and borrows too much the economy must pay 
the price in underinvestment reduced output and increased 
unemployment he said fed policy he said can do nothing to 
shelter the economy 
when the fed seeks to counteract these policy mistakes he said 
it merely exacerbates the consequences 
inflation will be the direct result and then ultimately a 
recession will be induced as the fed further reacts to the 
inflation it created by its original attempt to offset bad policy 
rahn would establish a monetary rule to limit fed discretion and 
govern monetary policy require that fed policy be set and 
implemented in public not behind closed doors and limit its 
authority in foreign currency markets 
moreover so that monetary policy wouldnt gyrate to accommodate 
government overspending he would commit congress to restrain 
spending to no more than the inflation rate

the canadian corporate parent of the federated and allied 
department store companies friday reported a loss of 80 million 
for the first quarter up sharply from a 67 million shortfall a 
year earlier 
the quarterly deficit for the distressed campeau corp came 
after a huge deterioration in its financial condition last year 
torontobased campeau lost 17 billion in 1989 after losing 34 
million in 1988 
campeau said the bankruptcy filing by federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp in january impaired revenue 
growth 
the cincinnati divisions which operate strings of us 
department stores including bloomingdales burdines jordan marsh 
and others filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy code on jan 15 
revenue from campeaus department store operations was virtually 
flat at 159 billion in the three months ended april 30 compared 
to 16 billion in 1989s first quarter 
total firstquarter revenue for campeau amounted to 226 
billion up 13 percent from a year earliers 223 billion the 
total included revenue from campeaus real estate operations as 
well as from ralphs grocery co a west coast supermarket chain 
that is not part of the bankruptcy case 
ralphs which added 10 supermarkets during 1989 and completed 38 
major remodeling projects was the star performer for campeau in 
the first quarter it had an 84 percent quarterly revenue gain to 
621 million from 573 million 
campeaus real estate revenue shrank to 50 million in the first 
quarter from 59 million 
in a separate announcement friday allied said it has reached 
agreement with chemical banking corp on new credit arrangements 
giving it continued access to capital to finance operations while 
it reorganizes under court supervision 
one of the two arrangements provides for borrowing power up to 
700 million over three years it will enable allied to raise money 
through the commercial paper market marking the first time a 
company in chapter 11 has tapped this market allied said 
the other arrangement extends an existing 300 million working 
capital financing agreement for two years until may 5 1993

it was too hot and dry to grow corn and 
soybeans in 1988 so farmers charles kerchenfaut and rob read 
decided to raise shrimp on the prairie 
more than 3000 freshwater shrimp now comb the bottom of a 
1000gallon tank to forage for commercial feed or hide from their 
cannibalistic cousins in a homemade shrimp condo structure 
its just a research project right now said kerchenfaut 
weve got to learn it before we can make a profit 
but two who are longtime friends and neighbors have harvested 
about 300 shrimp up to six inches long and sold them to pet shops 
for use in aquariums the shrimp sell for 5 to 7 each retail but 
the men declined to say how much they receive wholesale 
if we get the volume it would be nice eventually to supply 
the food market most shrimp now come from overseas said read 
we could hit the organic market these shrimp are 100 percent 
pure raised in water without any toxins 
the men said they got into shrimp production out of curiosity 
and because they had little else to do during the 1988 drought 
read raises grain on 2800 acres with his brother kerchenfaut 
farms 1200 acres 
the green plastic tank where the shrimp are raised is inside an 
old garage on kerchenfauts farm in ford county in eastcentral 
illinois 
water is filtered continuously to remove waste temperature and 
oxygen levels are monitored feed is added twice daily water 
quality is tested daily 
the farming begins when weekold shrimp are shipped in plastic 
bags from suppliers in places like puerto rico and hawaii 
theyre small said read pull out an eyelash thats 
what theyd be like 
they do not grow at the same rate but in three to four months 
many have reached market size several inches in length 
one of the biggest challenges the men faced was the lack of 
information about raising freshwater shrimp in tanks they read 
everything they could find about shrimp and called other producers 
and researchers 
we spent about 1000 on equipment said read the phone 
bills were probably our biggest expense 
read visited scientists at southern illinois university where 
chris kohler is conducting research at the fisheries research 
laboratory to develop better feed and better ways for producers to 
raise shrimp 
just about all the shrimp you eat are marine salt water 
shrimp kohler said the freshwater shrimp often are called 
prawn i think they are quite tasty and they bring a premium 
price 
the farmers learned that shrimp are cannibalistic hence 
adequate commercial feed and the condos for vulnerable molting 
shrimp to hide from the others 
they also learned that temperatures below 62 degrees are fatal 
to shrimp so when electricity was lost during the february ice 
storm a generator was used to heat the shrimp building 
the house was cold but the shrimp were warm kerchenfaut 
chuckled 
neither man has sampled the shrimp but read says he plans to 
get one pretty quick they are considering a summer cookout for 
neighbors featuring homegrown sweet corn and shrimp 
a lot of our neighbors are curious about what were doing 
said read i suppose some of them just think were nuts 
not the local chapter of future farmers of america adviser 
richard long who teaches at ford central high school said about 
35 ffa members will raise freshwater shrimp next fall kerchenfaut 
and read will share their experiences

its been described as the largest current civil 
engineering project a multibillion dollar link that will help 
revolutionize europes economy and physically end britains 
historic isolation a dream born in napoleons day 
the chunnel between britain and france is halfdug and 
scheduled to open on time in three years but the threetunnel 
thoroughfare under the english channel is almost 60 percent over 
budget embroiled in a contractor dispute and scrambling for more 
investment money 
the project also has raised increasing hostility among many 
britons who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the 
continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals 
we will have the money to finish the project says alastair 
morton british deputy chairman of eurotunnel the privately owned 
anglofrench company overseeing the work 
the chunnels june 15 1993 scheduled debut will come six months 
after the 12nation european community formally drops remaining 
trade barriers and becomes a unified marketplace of 320 million 
consumers but the projects success hinges on much more than just 
finishing the undug part 
while the french are forging ahead with a highspeed rail link 
to their end of the tunnel for example stateowned british rail 
is dragging 
britain becomes branch line of europe a guardian newspaper 
headline declared after the government announced june 14 that it 
would not fund a highspeed rail link between london and the 
british end of the tunnel 
its not the first time the idea of a tunnel has irritated 
britains island identity the british resisted an undersea bond 
with the continent envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a french 
engineer named albert mathieu napoleon wanted to build it but 
britain warned him off tunneling actually was started in 
subsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974 but they were scrapped 
the chunnel project also has been marred by eight accidental 
deaths on the site 
the british public demonstrates little enthusiasm for the 
chunnel random samplings elicit fears that it will import rabies 
terrorists invading armies 
there is an attitude in france that this is a great project in 
the national interest in this country the attitude to these 
projects tends to be the reverse morton told a recent news 
conference 
eurotunnel chairman andre benard said the company has provided 
for any foreseeable problems but stressed we always made it 
very clear that this was a risk project 
giant boring machines are digging three tunnels toward each 
other from folkestone england and calais france with the first 
underground meeting expected in november in the service tunnel 
between the rail tunnels 
tunneling is three months ahead of schedule on the french side 
a week behind on the british as of midjune workers had dug 532 
of the total 919 miles 
chunnel trains will carry passengers cars and freight between 
london and paris in about three hours roughly the same time as a 
flight including ground travel and at least twice as fast as a 
carferry journey 
eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent 
of britains nonoil trade will pass through the tunnel in the 
first year the civil aviation authority says the tunnel should 
divert 5 million out of 53 million air passengers annually 
this past wednesday shareholders approved a sale of an extra 
906 million worth of stock to existing shareholders who already 
have bought 17 billion worth that step could clear the way for a 
bank syndicates approval of additional credit eurotunnel has 
requested from 86 billion to 12 billion 
assuming banks approve the project would have a total of about 
146 billion in debt and equity financing the company most 
recently estimated it would cost 131 billion to complete vs 
83 billion forecast initially 
history dictates that that will not be the last figure we 
hear but the order of magnitude of increase will slow down said 
richard hannah a transport analyst with the london investment firm 
ubs phillips and drew he expected the extra financing to come 
through 
its one of these situations where the more money you put in 
the more you have to spend or else youre walking away from 
billions of pounds hannah said 
eurotunnel says it doesnt expect to p end of 
the century and probably wont pay shareholders a dividend until 
1999 four years later than envisioned 
but stockholders havenrofit before thet fared badly the shares first 
traded 
in november 1987 at about 6 have traded recently at 855 the 
more urgent worries for eurotunnel have been costs creditors and 
contractor feuds 
in october concern about the rising pricetag drove eurotunnels 
banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months until the 
company reached a truce with transmanche link the consortium of 
10 british and french contractors doing the construction over 
responsibility for 17 billion in overruns 
the problems led to eurotunnels second management shakeup since 
1987 
the british governments refusal to finance a rail link has 
presented another big obstacle 
eurotunnel says is can survive without a new link but cnt that she 
wont spend taxpayers money on a rail link 
the french government on the contrary is spending roughly 28 
billion building 210 miles of rail from paris to the tunnel with a 
branch to brussels where the ec is headquartered trains capable 
of 190 mph will link the tunnels freight and passengers to another 
planned highspeed system 
one reason the french are enthusiastic is that the tunnel 
surfaces in one of the most depressed areas of france 
on the other hand residents of kent in englands rural and 
prosperous southeast have campaigned strenuously against having 
highspeed trains screaming through their back yards

soybean futures prices climbed sharply friday on 
the chicago board of trade in the wake of an agriculture department 
report that unexpectedly reduced the governments estimate of 
soybean plantings 
corn futures ended narrowly mixed while most wheat futures 
retreated 
in a report released after thursdays close the usda pegged 
soybean plantings at 58 million acres about 14 million acres 
below the agencys march projection and 16 million below trade 
expectations 
the usda also lowered its corn acreage estimate by 200000 acres 
to a higherthanexpected 746 million reflecting planting delays 
caused by heavy spring rains in the midwest 
many analysts had expected the usda to report a corresponding 
increase in soybean acres confirming trade perceptions that 
farmers unable to plant corn had switched to soybeans 
the soybean rally also reflected some private forecasters 
predictions that hot dry weather will move into the corn belt late 
next week 
people were talking about putting a premium into the beans 
just in case we have a drought this summer said victor 
lespinasse an assistant vice president of dean witter reynolds inc 
at the close wheat futures were 4 cents lower to 4 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in july at 325 a bushel 
corn futures were cent lower to 1 cent higher with july at 296 
a bushel oats were 1 cents lower to cent higher with july at 
135 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents to 18 cents higher with

the group said its consumer confidence index for june stood at 
1025 percent down almost five points from may the year 1985

jobs were plentiful a 3 percentage point loss from may in 
addition those who fear there will be fewer jobs over the next six 
months outnumber those who expect more jobs continuing a pattern 
of the past few months linden said 
still while the measure of consumer confidence is now lower 
than it has been in more than 2 years there are no indications of 
impending recession linden said

campbell soup co said friday it would sell 
its us and canadian fresh foods and fresh produce businesses 
closing or selling a score of plants in a strategy of focusing on 
the companys more profitable units 
the restructuring the third in the past year affects about 
3000 jobs and includes the sale of businesses with annual revenue 
of more than 300 million 
the moves will result in aftertax charges of 247 million 
against net income for the fiscal year ending july 29 although the 
company did not say whether it would post an overall profit for the 
year 
we are clearing the decks of unprofitable and nonstrategic 
businesses while bringing our plant capacity more in line with 
manufacturing requirements campbell chief executive officer 
david w johnson said in a news release 
campbell stock jumped 137 a share to 5787 in late new york 
stock exchange trading 
pavlos m alexandrakis an analyst with argus research in new 
york said the restructuring was no surprise on wall street he 
noted that johnson was brought in from gerber products co in 
january because of his experience in turning around beleaguered 
companies 
campbells sluggish recent performance and depressed stock price 
have made it the target of frequent takeover rumors some members 
of the founding dorrance family which owns a major stake have 
urged a sale of the entire company 
campbell posted a profit of 131 million or 10 cents a share 
in fiscal 1989 down from 2741 million or 212 per share a 
year earlier largely because of previous restructuring costs 
revenue rose to 567 billion in fiscal 1989 from 487 billion 
the company has tried to remain independent by divesting 
underperforming businesses and by closing plants cutting costs and 
laying off hundreds of workers in moves earlier this year 
campbell eliminated about 8000 jobs 
david johnson is doing what he has to keep the company 
independent said john m mcmillin a food industry analyst with 
prudentialbache in new york hes selling off the bad pieces of 
campbell and trying to earn more with the good pieces 
campbell has been described as a laggard in the food industry 
slow to update facilities and products the companys dominance in 
the soup market has dropped in recent years and campbell has 
struggled to gain an upper hand in the fastgrowing dry soup market 
our strategy for strongly focused growth is exemplified by our 
decision to concentrate our efforts on our highmargin dry grocery 
and frozen foods business said herbert m baum president of 
campbell north america 
baum said it was a tough decision to exit the fresh foods and 
fresh produce businesses because they had strong potential 
however those businesses were not yet profitable enough to keep 
the fresh food group to be sold includes facilities in blandon 
pa dudley ga fennville mich hillsboro texas howe ind 
jackson ohio pescadero calif and west chicago ill 
the company also announced it plans to sell mrs giles 
refrigerated salads based in lynchburg calif and maries salad 
dressings which has a plant in thornton ill 
campbell plans to sell its sumter sc frozen poultry 
operation which employs about 1200 people it plans to close 
plants in fremont neb with 240 employees a pepperidge farm inc 
plant in grand prairie texas with 50 employees and an equipment 
manufacturing center in moorestown nj which employs 51 people 
also to be sold are domsea farms inc a salmon processor based 
in pocatello idaho the win schulers cheese business in marshall 
mich and the mckellar watt chilled food operation in govan

on its freshbake foods operations in the united kingdom

amp c spa of italy campbell seafoods division which operates in 
the united kingdom and belgium the vegetable division of campbell

that may eventually lead to a central ec banking system and a

but the road to economic and monetary union or emu in ec 
jargon will be bumpy

bank one communitywide monetary policy 
to make that palatable to skeptics notably british prime 
minister margaret thatcher the emus final form has been left 
ambiguous 
the ec executive commission has drafted a threestaged plan 
under the first stage starting sunday the ec nations will more 
closely coordinate their economic and monetary policies and lift 
remaining barriers to capital movements 
all ec currencies will join the european monetary systemss 
exchange rate regime which limits currency fluctuations also ec 
states will encourage greater private use of the european currency 
unit a quasicurrency now used mainly as an accounting unit in ec

they say the takeover boom is over but if 
thats so how do you explain philip morris cos decision to buy 
swiss candy maker jacobs suchard for 38 billion or conagra incs 
134 billion purchase of beatrice co 
easy the mergers and acquisitions business hasnt died it has 
evolved into another stage dealmakers are doing a new kind of 
buyout one that harks back to the days before the junk bond binge 
but has a few novel twists 
if you ask investment bankers about the deals theyre doing 
these days two words keep surfacing strategic and global 
philip keevil a managing director at sg warburg amp co the 
us arm of the british investment firm says it has been swamped 
in recent months handling mostly transactions that are started 
by strategic acquirers 
in a strategic deal a company seeks to expand through 
acquisition of a firm in a similar or related industry this is a 
far cry from the buyouts that dominated the merger wave of the 
1980s because they are undertaken by companies interested in 
running a business not investors looking for quick profits 
strategic transactions also differ from the megadeals of the 
80s because they do not involve the sale of the risky junk bonds 
that helped finance and in some cases undermine big buyouts 
the acquiring companies are putting up much more equity to finance 
their transactions 
so far the biggest deals of 1990 have been strategic when food 
giant conagra bought beatrice it picked up wellknown labels 
including swifts meats butterball turkeys and wesson oil philip 
morris another food company found a candy maker in jacobs suchard 
that would broaden its base 
even some recent hostile bids were strategic including georgia 
pacific corps 5 billion purchase of rival paper producer great 
northern nekoosa corp and torchmark incs failed 634 billion 
offer for another insurance and financial services company 
american general corp 
the emphasis on strategic moves is similar to the late 1970s and 
early 1980s before junk bonds came into vogue most of the deals 
done in the old days were by firms looking for opportunities to 
expand 
now they want to expand not only in their own countries but 
overseas todays market is global and more acquisitions are what 
dealmakers call crossborder transactions 
among warburgs recent deals was reckitt and colman plcs 
purchase of the boylemidway division of american home products 
corp for 125 billion 
reckitt and colman a british firm had already bought us 
businesses including durkee foods and airwick air fresheners the 
purchase of boylemidway a consumer products business represented 
a further move into the us market 
now every business looks at their competitive position on a 
worldwide basis said a prominent us investment banker who 
asked not to be identified you cant be in the car industry 
without looking at the worldwide car industry 
american companies are joining in philip morris purchase of 
jacobs suchard for example offers international expansion to a 
us firm 
youre seeing more american companies doing business in the 
uk and the continent said john cutts executive director for 
european mergers and acquisitions with the british investment firm 
samuel montagu amp co ltd 
at the same time you cant be a global company and not be 
present in the states cutts said 
if this sounds like the mergers business has found renewed 
vigor it hasnt there is still plenty of evidence that in spite 
of so many strategic and global opportunities the business has 
shrunk 
us merger transactions fell 50 percent over the first half of 
1990 from a year earlier the financial research firm securities 
data corp says through june 26 there were 2110 transactions 
including mergers spinoffs share repurchases and minority stake 
purchases valued at 882 billion down from 22420 deals worth 
193 billion in the first six months of 1989 
theres proof beyond the numbers in june bankers trust new 
york corp said it was reducing the corporate finance staff by 10 
percent the latest financial services company to cut personnel 
because of the dropoff in mergers 
several days later one of the most prominent takeover 
strategists of the 1980s the investor group coniston partners 
said it was disbanding because of scarcity of financing and 
worthwhile targets conistons three founding partners said they 
had to be realistic about the changing market for takeovers 
these events can be traced back to the collapse last fall of the 
junk bond market prices for the risky highyield securities 
plunged after the 67 billion debtfinanced takeover of federated 
department stores inc began to stumble its tough to sell junk 
bonds when there are few buyers 
the change has forced investors and dealmakers to adapt 
investment bankers who have sought crossborder deals are 
flourishing shearson lehman brothers inc is expanding its mergers 
staff and so are warburg and samuel montagu 
conistons founders said they would still seek acquisitions but 
via new forms of financing they said theyre also branching out 
into areas they hadnt focused on such as real estate 
paul tierney one of the three coniston partners said he felt a 
little nostalgic about the end of the investor group 
but when asked about the future he responded i feel great

energy futures finished mostly lower friday 
after an attempted rally failed to gather momentum in thin trading 
wholesale unleaded gasoline prices bucked the trend and the 
contract for july delivery closed sharply higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
but the gain reflected maneuvers associated with the last day of 
trading for the expiring july contract rather than an improvement 
in demand 
the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil sagged 8 cents to 1707 a 
42gallon barrel after jumping 47 cents on thursday contracts for

a second trial to decide how much ford motor co 
should pay for infringing on intermittent windshield wiper patents 
began thursday with the patent holder asking less than half the 
325 million he first sought 
an attorney for inventor robert kearns told a us district 
court jury in opening arguments that the former wayne state 
university engineering professor should receive 141 million 
i thought i had a better chance to persuade the jury it was 
right the attorney paul janicke said later 
a federal court jury said in january that ford on infringed 
kearns patents for the intermittent wiper system 
in the damages phase of the lawsuit us district judge avern 
cohn declared a mistrial may 9 after a jury failed to agree on how 
much ford should pay 
robert crandall of the brookings institute in washington 
testified in the first damages trial that based on a formula 
involving fords profits on the wipers kearns should receive 325 
million 
janicke said thursday that ford made 27 on each of 206 million

argued that kearns was entitled to 685 per system 
ford attorney paul wheeler said kearns should receive about 5 
cents per system or just over 1 million wheeler said 140 
million is more than ford or gm or any car company paid for 
royalties on all inventions combined

traders said the dollar lost ground amid anticipation of lower 
us interest rates 
the dollar is once again in a vulnerable position vis a vis 
the european countries which have a demand for capital said ron 
holzer chief dealer at harris trust and savings bank in chicago 
because the demand for capital is high overseas european 
interest rates have been edging up and in turn attracting 
investors to european securites 
president bushs announcement that taxes must be raised to help 
offset the nations budget deficit also served to push the dollar 
lower to many market players new taxes and a reduced budget 
deficit fuel the notion that interest rates will head lower 
because lessening federal borrowing needs would reduce demand for 
credit

the threat of mining strikes in south africa and the soviet 
union helped muster the depressed gold market to its strongest 
oneday advance in nearly three months friday on new yorks 
commodity exchange 
on other commodity markets silver futures also advanced 
soybeans surged while grain futures were mixed livestock and meat 
futures were mostly lower and energy futures slipped 
gold futures rose 580 to 590 in new york with the contract 
for delivery in august settling at 35990 a troy ounce the thinly 
traded july contract ended at 35790 
it was golds most muscular rally since april 6 when futures 
prices jumped 590 across the board 
silver futures settled 71 cents to 78 cents higher friday on 
the commodity exchange with july at 4887 a troy ounce 
analysts said the rally partly reflected trade buying to secure 
supplies ahead of a threatened general strike next week in south 
africa and a threatened soviet miners strike a week later 
further buying interest was stirred when the august topped 356 
triggering a wave of technically inspired buy orders 
bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber inc 
said south african gold miners were unlikely to join the threatened 
general strike in large numbers because union participation is not 
strong among mine worker there 
he also saw the soviet strike threat as weak but said gold 
prices could advance another 5 on technical factors especially if 
the dollar continues to weaken against other major currencies 
soybean futures climbed sharply on the chicago board of trade in 
the wake of a report in which the agriculture department 
unexpectedly reduced its estimate of planted soybean acreage 
corn futures ended narrowly mixed while most wheat futures 
retreated 
in a report released after thursdays close the usda pegged 
soybean plantings at 58 million acres about 14 million acres 
below the agencys march projection and 16 million below trade 
expectations 
the usda also lowered its corn acreage estimate by 200000 acres 
to a higherthanexpected 746 million reflecting planting delays 
caused by heavy spring rains in the midwest 
many analysts had expected the usda to report a corresponding 
increase in soybean acres confirming trade perceptions that 
farmers unable to plant corn had switched to soybeans 
the soybean rally also reflected some private forecasters 
predictions that hot dry weather will move into the corn belt late 
next week 
but in a sixto10day forecast released late friday the 
national weather service predicted normal to abovenormal rainfall 
in the midwest july 59 
wheat futures settled 4 cents lower to 3 cents higher with 
july at 325 a bushel corn futures were cent lower to cent 
higher with july at 295 a bushel oats were cent to cent 
lower with july at 135 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents to 19 
cents higher with july at 623 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower ahead of the 
usdas quarterly hogsandpigs inventory which was released after 
the close 
the report showed 544 million hogs and pigs in the united 
states as of june 1 3 percent less than on the same date a year 
ago the number was near expectations and was expected to have 
little effect on futures prices monday 
live cattle futures settled 10 cent lower to 13 cent higher 
with august at 7307 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 
35 cent lower with august at 8402 cents a pound live hogs were 
37 cent lower to 20 cent higher with july at 6040 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 97 cent to 155 cents lower with july at 
5820 cents a pound 
energy futures finished mostly lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange after an attempted rally failed to gather momentum in thin 
trading 
the july gasoline contract bucked the trend though and closed 
sharply higher 
west texas intermediate crude oil finished 8 cents to 23 cents 
lower with august at 1707 a barrel heating oil was 36 cent to 
79 cent lower with july at 4867 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 60 cent lower to 165 cents higher with july at 6258 cents a 
gallon

alleging its advertising is false and misleading 
chemlawn services corp can no longer advertise its lawncare 
applications as safe or nontoxic under the agreement with 
the state of new york attorney general robert abrams announced 
chemlawn also must pay the state 100000 in costs under the 
agreement approved by state supreme court justice leonard cohen 
although new york is the only state to prohibit chemlawn from 
making the advertising claims abrams said i am hopeful that 
todays agreement will have an impact on the way lawncare services 
are marketed and sold in other parts of the country 
under the agreement chemlawn based in columbus ohio is 
prohibited from claiming that it does not and will not use 
products that are known or probable human carcinogens 
the company admits to having used chlorothalonil maneb and 
mancozeb all of which are classified as probable human 
carcinogens or cancercausing agents 
chemlawns vice president of environmental affairs stephen 
hardymon said he understood the three chemicals are under 
advisory review by the environmental protection agency but 
havent been classified as carcinogens at this time 
he said none of the advertising at issue contained in brochures 
touting the safety of chemlawns products was false 
we did not admit any false and misleading advertisements 
hardymon said the settlement does not say that we did 
he said chemlawn settled the suit because its cost us an 
awful lot of money and we just wanted to get this behind us and 
move forward

federal securities regulators said thursday 
that a linkage system for the longdelayed multiple listing of 
options could be up and running by the end of the year 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden 
said four of the nations five options exchanges have reached 
agreement on a system for linking the various trading marketplaces 
breeden and sec market regulation division director richard g 
ketchum said however that the proposed system would have to go 
through the timeconsuming sec approval process before it could 
begin operation 
its not a long period i think we could still be looking at a 
linkage system being up by the end of 1990 or early 1991 of the 
type agreed to by the four exchanges said ketchum 
neither official would say what action the sec will take later 
this month when a voluntary delay in multiple listings ends 
we would have to reserve official judgement until we see a 
filing for a linkage system by the exchanges said breeden 
he said only the philadelphia stock exchange has not agreed to 
the proposed linkage system 
since january at sec request the nations options exchanges 
have delayed their phasein of multiple listings for options 
already being traded until june 30 that was to allow extra time to 
come up with a linkage system 
we wanted to take the time from january until june 30 to have 
an intensive review of whether a linkage system is feasible said 
breeden in an interview in his sixth floor office we have 
concluded that it is unquestionably feasible we have a specific 
system that four of the exchanges have agreed is a good one and 
should be built the next step now would be moving toward 
implementation of a system he added 
an option contract is the right to buy or sell a certain 
security at a specified price for a set period of time options are 
traded on stocks listed on exchanges or traded overthecounter via 
computer 
until earlier this year most options on the stocks listed on an 
exchange could be traded only in one marketplace at a time the 
privlege for trading a specific option assigned by lottery is not 
permitted on any other exchange 
but a rule passed by the sec last year abolished the limitations 
on multiple trading of options all new options listed for trading 
after january can be traded on any options exchange 
but breeden asked the heads of the american stock exchange the 
chicago board of options exchange the new york stock exchange the 
pacific stock exchange and the philadelphia exchange to 
voluntarilly refrain from multiple listing of existing options 
until june 30

bond prices finished higher friday for the 
fourth straight day after president bush repeated his comments that 
a tax hike may be necessary to prod the stalled budget talks in 
congress 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose 1532 point or 469 
per 1000 face amount the 30year bond had risen 1313 in the 
three previous sessions 
its yield which falls when prices rise slipped to 840 percent 
from 844 percent late thursday 
the bond markets climb began tuesday after bush reversed his 
longtime opposition to a tax increase he said tax revenue 
increases must be part of a broader budget agreement that would 
include spending cuts to reduce the federal deficit 
on friday bush expanded on his earlier comments saying he knew 
he had to change course to break a deadlock in congress justifying 
the change the president said the economy was slower and the 
deficit was now worse than any of us visualized when he made 
his pledge two years ago 
the market was in a slight downward correction prior to his 
comments said bob sbarra a senior vice president at the 
investment firm carroll mcentee amp mcginley inc while he didnt 
say anything new i think what the market concluded was that he 
clearly wanted action 
sbarra said the financial markets believe that if a budget 
accord that includes spending cuts is reached the federal reserve 
will ease interest rates to counter the potentially negative 
economic impact of the cutbacks 
lower rates usually boost the prices of fixedreturn investments 
such as bonds 
traders said the market had little reaction to two reports 
indicating continued weakness in the economy though the reports 
added to the price firmness a weakening economy often prompts the 
fed to ease interest rates 
the commerce department said sales of new homes inched up 04 
percent in may while this marked the first increase in six months 
home sales remained at their lowest level since the economy emerged 
from its last recession 
in addition the department revised downward its figure on new 
home sales for april from a 16 percent decline to a 52 percent 
drop 
meanwhile the chicago purchasing managers group said its index 
of corporate purchasing activity fell to 533 in june from 560 in 
may a figure above 50 generally means the economy is expanding 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were up by lsqb point to 732 point intermediate 
maturities advanced by between 316 point and 1332 point and 
longterm issues were up as much as point according to telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 246 to 116253 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 798 percent as the 
discount slipped 1 basis point to 773 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills fell to 8 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 760 
percent yields on oneyear bills dropped to 801 percent as the 
discount fell 4 basis points to 746 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 7 percent down from 8 
516 percent late wednesday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 316 point to 91 the average yield to

a jury friday awarded 159 million to an inventor 
who claimed gte products corp pulled the plug on his fledgling 
lighting business by stealing his idea for a cool lamp used in 
movie studios 
a us district court jury agreed with george panagiotou a 
former rock band manager turned lighting entrepreneur who said he 
got the idea for his socalled cool light during his years as a 
boston nightclub manager in the early 1970s 
panagiotou had charged that trade secrets for his cool light 
were unfairly appropriated by the danvers massbased lighting 
giant which then manufactured a similar product and sent 
panagiotous own company into ruin 
the jury found that panagiotous invention of a reflector that 
cut the heat from movie lights was a trade secret improperly 
obtained by gte a division of gte corp of stamford conn and 
that gte officials falsely told panagiotou they could make the 
reflectors needed for the lamp 
but the jury also found that gte did not use the secret to 
advance its own business interests and did not profit from 
panagiotous cool light secret 
edwin mccabe panagiotous lawyer said the award would come to 
about 25 million with interest 
panagiotou who has since started a successful home video light 
company in los angeles said he was elated by the verdict 
i feel fantastic i feel great because its over its behind 
us he said we certainly triumphed 
vincent dalessandro a gte spokesman said the firm would 
appeal 
were disappointed by the verdict dalessandro said our 
contention is that weve done nothing wrong there was no secret 
we didnt break a contract and we contend there should be no 
damages 
panagiotou born in romania of greek descent came to boston at 
age 16 started working in the citys nightclubs and eventually 
helped form the rock band aerosmith and managed such groups as rush 
he said in court records that he started developing the cool 
light when he realized how uncomfortable performers were under the 
wilting heat of the performance lights of the 1970s 
cool light was used in the production of tv programs popular in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s including lou grant police 
woman switch and little house on the prairie 
panagiotou filed the suit in california in 1984 the trial began 
last month and attracted such stars as ed asner and michael landon 
to testify on panagiotous behalf 
according to court documents celebrities such as robert wagner 
refused to act without cool lights once they had used them 
lawyers for cool light panagiotous firm argued that 
panagiotou was tricked into a gentlemans agreement with gte 
under the pact panagiotou would give gte his production 
secrets gte would manufacture a special reflector for the lights 
panagiotou would place the reflector in the light fixtures at his 
expense at his own plant and then distribute it to customers 
but soon after he revealed the unpatented secret gte 
discontinued the outside contracting of products made with some 
materials including those used for the reflector gte stopped 
supplying cool light with reflectors mccabe said 
cool light consequently folded while gte started distributing 
products made with the secret mccabe said 
gte had maintained that panagiotou failed to show there had been 
any trade secrets or that there had been a breach of contract 
since panagiotous company shut down other types of lights have 
been used in hollywood mccabe said 
but panagiotou said he planned to once again make the cool light 
were certain we will produce the cool light again he said 
no one has filled that gap in the market this time they will be 
improved

atlantic richfield co said friday it had 
paid 800 million to the internal revenue service to settle a 
dispute over windfall profit taxes on alaska oil lifting a 
longstanding cloud over the company 
the payment settles a claim for back taxes and interest that 
totaled 18 billion believed to be the largest claim ever 
presented to a company by the irs in settling the dispute arco 
admitted no wrongdoing 
arco the secondbiggest producer of alaska crude oil said the 
payment will resolve all irs claims for additional windfall profit 
taxes including interest on its north slope production from 1980 
to 1985 
arco had set aside reserves since the mid1980s to cover 
settlements of disputes over alaska oil it said those reserves 
covered the huge payment 
arco is adequately reserved so the setlement payment will have 
no impact on earnings said spokesman al greenstein 
arco disclosed in july 1988 that the government had presented it 
with a 11 billion backtaxes bill in the dispute over how the 
company valued oil that it produced in alaska from 1980 to 1983 
the bill consisted of 577 million in taxes plus interest 
this april the company said it was also subject 212 million 
plus interest for 1984 and 1985 
all told the irs had been demanding 18 billion in taxes and 
interest greenstein said 
the irs started investigating arco in the mid1980s after rival 
oil companies complained its internal pricing policies were 
unjustifiably minimizing its taxes allowing it to charge less for 
gasoline than rivals in the competitive california retail market 
arco denied the allegations 
the dispute settled friday centered on the value assigned by 
arco to crude oil it pumped from north slope wells the irs 
contends arco assigned the oil a value lower than it should have at 
that point lessening the windfall profits tax which is based on a 
benchmark price derived from past production on a given oil field 
that lower windfall profits tax let arco ultimately set prices 
lower on the retail gasoline it sold at the pumps other oil 
companies complained 
the settlement was the latest in a series of similar cases 
dating back to the mid1980s for arco and other oil companies 
in 1986 for example arco agreed to pay the state of alaska 
243 million as part of a tax settlement covering the companys 
production on the north slope and cook inlet fields still 
unresolved from that time is a dispute with alaska over royalties 
paid on the same production alaska is demanding 320 million in 
that case greenstein said 
also that year arco agreed to pay 315 million in restitution 
and fines to settle allegations of violating federal oil price 
controls in the 1970s and early 1980s

time warner inc sued pathe communications 
corp for 100 million friday contending pathe broke a contract 
giving time warner inc distribution rights to pathe and united 
artists films 
the lawsuit was the latest development in the struggle by 
giancarlo parretti the italian financier who owns pathe to finnce 
his proposed 13 billion buyout of mgmua communications co 
time warner agreed april 9 to lend pathe 650 million toward the 
purchase in return for distribution rights to new pathe and united 
artists films and the valuable united artists movie library time 
warner also got a lien on the library as collateral 
but time warner insisted that pathe provide the rest in equity 
at least 450 million of that from pathes own sources rather than 
borrowed money 
pathe had been trying to renegotiate the equity part of the 
deal but announced thursday it had reached an impasse with time 
warner pathe said it would continue to talk with time warner but 
also would seek alternate sources of financing 
time warners lawsuit filed in los angeles superior court 
alleges that pathe acted as if the contract gave pathe a oneway 
option to decide which of its obligations it would honor which 
time warner rights it could ignore and which conditions it would 
satisfy 
pathe spokesman craig parsons said no one at beverly hillsbased 
pathe had seen the lawsuit and thus could not comment on it 
asked if it was a surprise he said things had not in our 
view gotten that hostile so im at a loss to explain it at this 
point 
the lawsuit asserts that pathe is creating a smokescreen to 
obscure the actual fact that pathe was unable or unwilling to 
perform under the april 9 letter agreement and as an excuse to seek 
alternative financing 
mgmuas stock price fell friday on the news that the main 
source of financing for pathes offer was in jeopardy 
the stock which fell 62 cents per share to 1725 on the new 
york stock exchange already was trading far below the level 
expected if investors believed pathes 2150pershare offer would 
be completed as scheduled on oct 23 analysts said 
under parrettis latest agreement with kirk kerkorian the 
billionaire who controls mgmua 4 per share of the 2150 is to 
be paid to mgmua shareholders on july 20 
parretti already has put 200 million into escrow which will be 
used toward the distribution he is to kick in another 53 million 
to get to the 4pershare level 
many of those buying mgmua stock dont believe the deal will go 
through said jeffrey logsdon an analyst with crowell weedon inc 
in los angeles 
instead he said theyre gambling that they can pocket the 4 
then get the rest of their money back and more when kerkorian sells 
the studio to another buyer at a lower price 
pathe spokesman parsons noted that the company already has the 
200 million in cash down payments invested in the deal he said 
the company was looking at a broad universe of options for 
raising the rest of the money 
the lawsuit filed friday by time warner inc and time warner 
home video inc accuses pathe of breaching theatrical and home 
video distribution agreements for pathe films with respect to the 
video rights agreement the lawsuit says pathe entered into the 
agreement without telling warner it already had previously granted 
the rights to another company
