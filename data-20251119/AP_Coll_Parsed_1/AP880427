the irancontra trial judge accused the reagan 
administration wednesday of intentionally holding back classified 
documents needed by the defense and warned that charges would be 
dismissed if the stonewalling continues 
us district judge gerhard a gesell blamed the dilemma not on 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh but on an interdepartmental 
task force that has control over hundreds of thousands of secret 
documents that may be needed in the case 
a stone wall is being built up between this court and the 
trial gesell said at the end of a daylong pretrial hearing 
noting that walsh has tried to get the documents for the 
defense the judge said the responsibility lies with the 
attorney general and the white house i want to find out promptly 
what is taking place and what is going to take place 
gesell said the case has encountered a serious obstacle because 
of the administrations intentional withholding of documents 
necessary for the defense 
he also has said the case cannot go to trial unless the 
administration declassifies relevant documents that may be 
introduced into evidence 
justice department spokesman patrick korten said there is 
certainly no attempt being made to impede the process in any way 
were talking about a large volume of material here that needs 
careful examination the task force with justice department 
involvement is working as fast as they can to process the 
documents he said 
korten noted that the task force is not something totally 
within justice department control its something that involves a 
number of different agencies including the white house the state 
department the defense department and the cia it is not a 
process that works quickly 
gesell said we cannot satisfy the maximum desires of the 
interdepartmental committee and added he was not interested in 
trying to summarize contents of masses of documents 
we are not going to sit around in court in a series of secret 
hearings and rewrite the documents and get them ready for trial 
that is not the way to conduct a trial in this country he said 
the question of the classified documents to be discussed at a 
hearing thursday and defense accusations of improper 
evidencegathering by the prosecution dim chances of an early trial 
date although gesell did not address the date directly 
he said there would be hearings on those two matters through 
may gesell originally sought a july trial date while the defense 
has said it will not be ready until next march walsh said he is 
ready to go to trial in july 
gesell said he was gravely concerned about the classified 
documents sternly warning prosecutors the case will have to be 
dismissed if the records are not turned over to defendants oliver 
l north john m poindexter albert hakim and richard v secord 
walsh said 24597 classified government documents are now 
available for review by the defense team only slightly more than 
the 24000 pages that walsh said were ready two weeks ago 
gesell has ordered walsh to make up to 300000 pages of 
classified documents available to the defendants 
the judge said i was extremely disturbed by the 
implications of a motion filed tuesday by hakim who complained 
that walsh was trying to limit his access to the most sensitive 
documents gathered in the investigation 
at a previous hearing gesell said all defendants and their 
lawyers must have access to the records including hakim a 
businessman who never has been granted a security clearance 
the other three defendants have had long military careers 
north in the marine corps poindexter in the navy and secord in the 
air force during which they frequently handled classified 
materials 
gesell said he wants to break what appears to be a very 
serious logjam over the records 
the defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the united 
states by illegally diverting money from secret us arms sales to 
iran to the nicaraguan contra rebels when such assistance was 
banned by law 
the 23count indictment also accuses north hakim and secord of 
improperly benefiting financially from the arms sales profits 
which it says belonged to the united states 
north is the former national security council staffer who 
directed the iran and contra assistance operations poindexter who 
approved norths activities was president reagans national 
security adviser and secord and hakim were businessmen recruited 
by north to handle logistics and finances in both operations 
the problem of prosecution evidencegathering results from 
congressional grants of limited immunity for north hakim and 
poindexter when they testified before congress on the irancontra 
affair last summer secord testified without immunity 
immunity grants bar walsh from using testimony of the three 
defendants in prosecution against them except in cases of perjury 
the defense has accused walsh and his assistant prosecutors of 
using just such evidence with north attorney brendan v sullivan 
jr saying the prosecutors procedures to avoid taint were 
laughable on their face 
gesell ordered this weeks limited hearing on the immunity 
question to determine if he would need a much longer pretrial 
session on the subject he decided wednesday that the expanded 
hearing would be necessary before trial 
were a long way from any resolution of the question gesell 
said i want the benefit of a full argument on both sides it 
ought to be clear there is a problem he acknowledged that 
the difficulty was caused by congress decision to grant the 
immunity 
as he did in a hearing on monday walsh took the witness stand 
wednesday to describe the precautions he and his staff took to 
avoid exposure to testimony given under immunity 
walsh testified that judith hetherton an associate counsel on 
his staff had to cut off a justice department official who had 
started to convey to her testimony from north to the housesenate 
irancontra committee last summer 
she had to really be forceful with him to get him to stop 
he testified 
the washington post quoted a justice department spokesman as 
saying that the official was assistant attorney general william 
bradford reynolds but that his remark to ms hetherton was only a 
brief inadvertent reference to a segment of norths testimony 
hetherton was one of the prosecutors who questioned reynolds 
when he appeared before a grand jury earlier this year for 
questioning about his role in the november 1986 investigation of 
the irancontra affair 
in addition to general instructions to his staff the 
independent counsel said he took extraordinary steps at times 
even ordering staffers to take a twoweek vacation after poindexter 
began to testify walsh did the same 
even so he said there was the day he turned on the lights in 
his hotel room to sign for breakfast and accidentally saw a banner 
headline in the newspaper on poindexters testimony 
another time walsh testified his daughter called him after 
norths testimony to say she didnt realize how difficult his 
job was i learned there was enough of an impact from the 
congressional testimony to have her call he said 
and gesell indicated that it was impossible for anyone to avoid 
the impact of the case pointing out that he saw a north for 
president sticker on the way to his virginia farm

israeli analysts trace the reconciliation of 
yasser arafat and president hafez assad of syria to assads desire 
for more influence in israelioccupied lands and the plo chiefs 
need for syrian help in lebanon 
if the arab rivals settle their differences the results would be 
more violence against israel isolation of jordan and the end of 
the us peace plan for the middle east already criticized by both 
israelis and arabs the analysts predicted 
one said he did not expect the reconciliation to last because 
distrust between arafat and assad is so profound 
the two met on monday in damascus capital of syria syrian and 
palestinian sources said they discussed the us peace plan and the 
arab rebellion that began nearly five months ago in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
it was arafats first visit to damascus since syria expelled him 
june 24 1983 during a mutiny against his leadership by plo 
factions backed by assad 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said israels response to the 
meeting would be to heighten its alert along its borders and in the 
west bank and gaza which israel has occupied since the 1967 
arabisraeli war 
since the rebellion in the territories began dec 8 
palestinians have tried 11 times to enter israel from lebanon in 
the latest attempt tuesday two israeli soldiers and three 
guerrillas were killed 
whenever you have an arab consensus it will always be 
directed against the security of israel shamir said on israel 
radio therefore we have to be vigilant 
according to the analysts the reconciliation effort was 
prompted by assads desire for more influence in the occupied 
territories where most palestinians support the palestine 
liberation organization and by arafats need for free movement for 
his fighters in lebanon 
syria has 25000 soldiers in lebanon and is the main power 
broker in a nation factionalized by 13 years of civil war 
a significant element in arafats decision was the weakening of 
his mainstream fatah movement by the assassination april 16 of his 
deputy khalil wazir better known as abu jihad military analyst 
zeev schiff said in an interview 
wazir who was buried in damascus last week was popular with 
both arafat loyalists and prosyrian plo dissidents 
israeli sources have said israeli commandos killed wazir but 
the government has not acknowledged it 
the abu jihad killing hurt arafats supporters and may have 
been an impetus for this meeting said schiff a correspondent 
for the daily haaretz arafat wants to appear more radical this 
meeting shows the plo leader is like a pendulum moving from one 
position to another 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said either syria or the plo must 
compromise if an alliance was to be achieved and assad would not 
moderate his position 
instead the syrians will demand from him arafat extreme 
positions that will pull him away from jordan from egypt rabin 
predicted on israel television 
yossi olmert a middle east specialist at tel aviv university 
said a plosyrian alliance probably would isolate king hussein of 
jordan because he is more moderate than assad and willing to 
discuss solutions to the middle east conflict 
olmert said the meeting also was bad news for the united states 
this is the last nail in the coffin of the us peace 
proposal he said its yet another insurmountable difficulty 
for secretary of state george p shultz at least at this 
juncture 
in predicting the arafatassad alliance would collapse he said 
the plo and syria both want to keep pressure on israel from 
the territories and from lebanon and they both are not eager to 
make concessions for peace 
but even though we see them kissing now at the end of the day 
syrian suspicion of the plo and plo distrust of syria is so 
profound that i cant see how it can last 
he and others predicted the shortterm impact of the 
arafatassad meeting would be negative 
the sulha in damascus will fuel further unrest in the 
territories correspondent uzi machnaimi wrote in the daily 
yediot ahronot using the arabic word for a reconciliation meeting 
palestinians in the occupied lands applauded the meeting 
we palestinians have been waiting for this moment said 
elias freij a palestinian christian who favors jordan and is mayor 
of bethlehem 
former mayor bassam shakaa of nablus said the plosyrian 
reconciliation will double the power of the uprising the fighting 
spirit of the palestinians will soar

evangelist billy graham is hardly a household 
name in this officially atheist nation where spreading the gospel 
to nonbelievers is against the law 
but his whirlwind tour has left behind some unlikely images 
when the southern baptist met with premier li peng he urged the 
leader of the worlds largest communist nation to study the life of 
jesus christ 
when he toured the great wall he led a group of schoolchildren 
in a chorus of jesus loves the little children 
although the visit has received little publicity in the national 
media chinese christian leaders say it shows that the current 
official attitude toward religion is the most relaxed its been 
since the communist takeover in 1949 
it shows that out state leaders recognize the great influence 
of religious leaders in other countries said shen yifen pastor 
of shanghais community church and vice president of the 
stateappointed china christian council which is in charge of all 
protestant churches 
i think his visit will help more people understand 
christianity and also the place of christianity in any society 
he said 
christians form a tiny minority among chinas more than 1 
billion people the official protestant church has an estimated 4 
million members as does the official catholic church which does 
not recognize vatican authority 
the 69yearold graham who concludes his 16day visit on 
thursday is regarded as a leading figure in the protestant church 
and has preached in nearly 70 countries but his name is unknown to 
most chinese 
many chinese however are curious about christianity and its 
influence on politics in the west even if they have no religious 
beliefs themselves 
at a news conference in shanghai on monday 15 chinese reporters 
peppered graham with questions for nearly an hour on such topics as 
the role of religion in world affairs 
graham has said repeatedly during his visit that he senses a 
desire for spiritual renewal in china 
in talking with leaders about religion and freedom and human 
rights i have found a very warm and favorable response graham 
told the news conference 
some leaders brought the subject up themselves each one i 
think without exception said we recognize the problems we are 
trying to do something about them 
during the 196676 far leftist cultural revolution all 
religious activity was banned in china and places of worship were 
destroyed or turned into factories warehouses and schools 
in recent years some churches have reopened and controls have 
relaxed but religion still is subject to close state supervision 
any efforts to convert nonbelievers outside of church are banned 
graham refused after his meeting with li to say whether they 
discussed the continued imprisonment of christians for their 
religious activities several roman catholic priests have been 
jailed for years for refusing to renounce loyalty to the pope 
asked in shanghai why he wasnt raising such hard issues 
grahams only response was who says i didnt 
he has not commented in public on the reported arrest of a 
christian preacher who had come to beijing to hear graham speak 
the preacher xu yongzhe escaped several years ago from a 
detention center where he had been held for spreading the gospel 
according to the chinese church research center in hong kong 
the center has links to protestants in china who worship in 
unofficial house churches rather than the official church 
members of grahams group were enthusiastic about the impact of 
his visit one calling it a very important breakthrough for 
china 
carol lee hamrin a chinese affairs specialist who accompanied 
graham said the visit led to a lot of consciousnessraising 
among officials who met with graham and would not otherwise have 
thought about religion 
graham himself said only that he hoped to build bridges of 
understanding between china and the united states 
another more modest goal that he fulfilled was to visit the 
birthplace of his wife ruth who accompanied him on the trip along 
with their eldest son franklin 
mrs graham the daughter of a missionary surgeon was born in 
eastern chinas jiangsu province and lived there until age 17 the 
town was the grahams first stop after leaving beijing

the stunning performance of extreme rightist 
jeanmarie le pen in the presidential elections first round 
indicates a major split among french conservatives that could put 
them in the minority for years 
the national front leader surpassed all predictions sunday 
winning 144 percent of the vote he nearly matched the 165 
percent gained by former centerright premier raymond barre and was 
not far behind conservative premier jacques chirac who had 195 
percent 
sundays winner with 341 percent of the vote was president 
francois mitterrand a 71yearold socialist who built a moderate 
image in the waning years of his first sevenyear term chirac 55 
will face him in a runoff may 8 and attracting le pens supporters 
appears to be the premiers only chance 
the right which is in the majority today in france risks 
being in the minority in two weeks said pascal perinot of the 
center for french political studies chirac is caught between two 
blocs demanding different things 
chiracs conservative rally for the republic party is allied 
with the centerright union for french democracy which backed 
barre in the first round but the alliance is not always an easy 
one 
some of barres centrist backers are expected to cross over to 
mitterrand and that seepage could become a flood if chirac makes 
overtures to le pen 59 who has emerged as a major force after 20 
years on the margin of french politics 
his goals repeated often and eloquently are to rid france of 
third world immigrants save jobs and welfare benefits for the 
french and crack down on crime which he also blames on immigrants 
chirac has pledged not to make a deal with le pen for support 
leaving him with the problem of how to lure national front voters 
without their leader 
whatever chirac does the traditional conservative parties risk 
the same political trap in which the left was caught during much of 
the past three decades 
for years the socialists had the communist party representing 
20 percent to 25 percent of the vote in the 1960s and 1970s 
looming over their shoulders and frightening moderate voters only 
with the decline of the communists in the 1980s did the socialists 
come to the fore 
that same phenomenon could be facing the right 
for a quarter of a century the left was kept out of power 
because of the power of the communist party political analyist 
alain duhamel wrote in a commentary if the present parliamentary 
majority doesnt watch out the existence of an influenctial 
national front could constitute a similar handicap 
simone veil a leading centrist politican and former president 
of the european parliament said if jacques chiracs language 
borrows the themes of the national front he will lose much more 
from the center than he will gain from jeanmarie le pens voters 
she said her vote would be one of those lost to chirac in such a 
case 
pierre mehaignerie another centrist leader said jacques 
chirac has two weeks to answer and give these centrist voters the 
assurances they are seeking 
mitterrand who was visiting the french antilles was quick to 
grasp the national front stick and thrash chirac with it 
i would not like to see the formation of an anomalous 
coaltion the incumbent declared 
i hope that no responsible candidate will allow himself to go 
so far as to discuss with deal with or foresee a future government 
with a political movement which with regard to racism shows so 
much indulgence it is on this kind of political act that one will 
judge real intentions and that one will judge on may 8 
perinot said the traditional right will no longer be credible 
among voters unless it ends internal quarrels and finds a way to 
weaken the national front 
chirac must pick up a part of this electorate but he will not 
get it all because in this election there was a large amount of 
protest of hostility toward the political class perinot said 
the extreme right vote was an antipolitical demonstration 
national front voters tend to be young and male largely from 
the class of shopkeepers artisans and small businessmen a similar 
movement led by pierre poujade succeeded in electing 53 deputies to 
the national assembly in 1956 among them le pen but faded in the 
next election 
although the national front appeals to many of the same voters 
it also attracts the working class which makes up about 20 percent 
of its support 
in the 1950s and 1960s the french never gave a durable vote 
to the extreme right because of the vichy experience said 
perinot referring to the wartime government that collaborated with 
the nazis now most of the young have forgotten history and the 
extreme right has emerged

levar burton and louis gossett jr will 
recreate their roles as kunta kinte and fiddler in a television 
movie roots christmas 12 years after work started on the 
original roots production 
the abc movie was scheduled to go into production here today 
production started on roots alex haleys epic of a black 
familys journey from africa to slavery to freedom on april 28 
1976 in savannah ga 
roots christmas dramatizes the inherent lust for freedom 
that motivated early mass escapes of slaves which paved the way 
for the underground railroad haley said at a news conference 
tuesday at burbank studios 
the setting for the tale is christmas 1770 the underground 
railroad was a system of safe houses set up by abolitionists to 
move slaves to freedom in the years before the civil war 
in the course of researching roots there was such a breadth 
of things that i could only select some of them for the book 
haley said one of the things that intrigued me was the sporadic 
undisciplined efforts of the slaves to run away i had been reading 
about the underground railroad and felt this would work well with a 
christmas setting 
haley noted that such first generation slaves as kunta kinte 
were usually moslem and strongly held on to their religious beliefs 
even though they were surrounded by christians he said kunta 
kinte who came to be called toby married a christian woman belle 
and that fiddler also was a christian influence on him 
the movie which will be filmed in los angeles and nashville 
tenn also stars michael learned shaun cassidy avery brooks 
jerry hardin as the plantation owner and kate mulgrew as hattie 
carraway a female slave catcher whose character is based on a real 
person said haley 
kevin hooks will direct the movie from david eyres screenplay 
executive producer david wolper said the twohour movie will be 
filmed in 18 days at a cost of 4 million the cost for all 12 
hours of roots was 65 million 
gossett said kunta kinte and fiddler have entered american 
folklore they are important characters and i feel its a 
comfortable cloak for me to wear i think its very important to do 
a story like this for christmas when this country needs healing of 
all sorts 
haley said he would be leaving soon on a series of freighter 
voyages to write a book about madam cj walker a poor black woman 
who became the first black millionaire and helped spark the 
socalled harlem renaissance 
haley a former coast guardsman does all his writing on long 
ocean voyages aboard rented cabins on freighters 
roots which ran for eight nights in january 1977 is still 
ranked as one of the most watched dramatic presentations in 
television history more than 100 million people watched the final 
night 
the sequel roots the next generation was broadcast over 
seven nights in february 1979 and also received high ratings

us diplomats negotiating in geneva on an 
international pollution agreement demanded a right for the united 
states to emit 20 percent more of a key ingredient of acid rain 
than it produced last year the washington post reported wednesday 
we started controlling emissions long before the europeans 
thought about it sheldon meyers the environmental protection 
agencys acting associate administrator for international 
activities told the newspaper 
we have a program in place that has affected the lives of most 
us citizens and we feel like we should get credit for it 
meyers said 
a highranking canadian official who was not identified by the 
post said us diplomats told canadian officials tuesday that they 
would not accept an alternative proposal offered by canada earlier 
this month 
under that compromise proposal canada agreed to a provision 
that would have resulted in smaller increases in us discharges of 
nitrogen oxides as long as they did not result in increases of the 
pollutant moving into canada the paper reported 
instead the us diplomats said they would press a demand for 
provisions that would increase nitrogen oxide emissions by 4 
million tons annually the post quoted the canadian official as 
saying 
it was a total rejection the canadian was quoted as saying 
we were hoping for some progress and theres no progress at all 
the main problem is it could result in a significant increase in 
the flow of nitrogen oxides across the border into canada 
the united states canada the soviet union and western and 
eastern european nations have been negotiating since 1983 to try to 
solve air pollution problems that cross national borders 
the united states has insisted that it should get credit for the 
steps it took before other countries got involved in air pollution 
control such as controls on auto tailpipes and smokestack 
emissions that have resulted in a 14 percent reduction in nitrogen 
oxide pollution in the past 10 years 
the new us position came on the eve of a visit to washington 
by canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
the two countries in addition to participating in the 
international negotiations have been working on a bilateral 
agreement on ways to reduce acid rain emissions a senior 
administration official predicted tuesday that the two countries 
will not reach agreement on that before the reagan administration 
leaves office

an agency trying to preserve the character 
of massachusetts rural towns has published a guide on how those 
municipalities can retain their charm 
the 183page manual titled dealing with change in the 
connecticut river valley was unveiled tuesday by the center for 
rural massachusetts and is designed to help selectmen and planners 
corral development that can destroy the very characteristics that 
make rural areas desirable 
anthony yaro the centers director and an author of the manual 
pointed to connecticut as an example of what not to do that 
whole state is close to turning into one large commuter suburb 
he said 
the legislature created the center for rural massachusetts in 
1985 when lawmakers became aware of farmlands vulnerability to 
development 
the center is based at the college of food and natural resources 
at the university of massachusetts in amherst which has developed 
guidelines for rural landscape protection 
some of those guidelines defy conventional wisdom which 
dictates that new homes must be built on big lots 
the booklet recommends that houses and businesses sit in 
clusters well back from the road and the land between the buildings 
and the road be filled with native trees and wildflowers rather 
than the junipers and bark mulch ubiquitious in suburbia 
it is ironic that the traditionally tightly knit village 
pattern so typical of rural new engand is illegal to reproduce or 
emulate in many if not most rural massachusetts communities 
today the manual said 
randall g arendt the centers associate director said he was 
appalled to see the haphazard way development has sprung up in new 
england towns and cities after spending seven years studying in 
england where growth is strictly limited to tasteful clusters of 
homes in villages leaving precious farmland untouched 
planning here is almost a futile exercise he said 
he said roads with businesses lining both sides are becoming 
commonplace in western massachusetts he compared them to 
hardening of the arteries these are strips of commercial ribbons 
that dont allow traffic to move swiftly and safely 
but he blamed zoning laws not businesses for the clogged roads

john heinz in the fall 
with 73 percent of the vote counted vignola had 398751 or 51 
percent to 252378 or 31 percent for former potter county 
commissioner susan sullivan kefover who ran a surprisingly strong 
second

steven douglas were trailing far behind douglas with 97539 votes 
and logue 53968 
vignola was backed by gov robert p casey philadelphia mayor 
w wilson goode and the democratic state committee 
former potter county commissioner susan sullivan kefover 
villanova university professor john logue and larouche democrat 
steven douglas also sought the nomination 
heinz said he would run very hard on his record and his agenda 
our job in pennsylvania is to move ahead without leaving 
anyone behind heinz said in a television interview 
asked about the task of taking on the wealthy incumbent in the 
fall vignola replied if i were making ketchup perhaps it would 
be difficult im not making ketchup im running against a 
lackluster us senator 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
pennsylvania democrats have not elected one of their own to the 
us senate since joseph clark narrowly gained a second term in 
1962 
heinz who faced no opposition in the primary refused to be 
drawn into any exchange with vignola who contended heinz has lost 
touch with his constituency 
ask me after the primary heinz said when asked if he would 
debate vignola 
vignola 38 a lawyer called on heinz to limit campaign 
spending to 2 million 
heinz 49yearold heir to the hj heinz food empire is one of 
the senates wealthiest members and has raised more than 5 million 
in his previous two senate campaigns 
heinz has about 2 million in his campaign fund for november 
while vignola has raised about 200000 
vignola has cited his philadelphia rowhouse roots saying 
pennsylvania needs a senator to represent the people on main 
street not wall street 
he has said he would focus on heinzs voting record for aid to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels the spacebased missiledefense 
system and the mx missile and his opposition to costofliving 
increases in social security 
i am carrying the democratic agenda he said an agenda 
which educates our children puts our people back to work cares 
for our senior citizens provides a viable defense for our nation 
and uses every day to build for a better tomorrow 
heinz spokesman richard bryers said during the campaign that it 
was unfair to portray the senator as a republican fat cat who 
ignores his constituency 
the senators basic approach is that the way you get 
reelected is to do your job for the people bryers said hes 
got an agenda for pennsylvania the senator is reaching out to 
broaden the base of his support with the working people

additional warnings and new packaging to discourage use by pregnant 
women a government panel says 
since its introduction in 1982 the drug accutane has carried 
specific and explicit warnings that there is a high risk it will 
cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy 
those warnings have been strengthened in intervening years but 
food and drug administration officials are concerned too many women 
and perhaps their doctors are ignoring them 
against that backdrop an advisory panel convened by the fda on 
tuesday concluded that the medication the only one that cures the 
severe scarring type of acne it is intended to treat is too 
valuable to deny to thousands of patients solely to provide added 
protection to those who would abuse it 
moreover panel members noted that the drug marketed by roche 
laboratories of new jersey also is available in 40 other countries 
and probably would find its way onto a us black market if made 
illegal 
after concluding unanimously that the benefit of the drug 
outweighed the risk of its misuse the panel recommended a number 
of steps to strengthen the warnings to doctors and patients against 
its use by women who are pregnant or at risk of becoming pregnant 
one of those recommendations embraced a proposal by roche to 
sell accutane only in a socalled blister package in which explicit 
patient warnings including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a 
red x drawn through it would be sealed at the factory to make 
sure the patient would see them 
the panel also recommended that the fda try to find a legal way 
to partially restrict distribution perhaps by saying only 
dermatologists could prescribe it and that two doctors would have 
to agree that the patient needed the drug and would not become 
pregnant during the four to five months the drug is typically taken 
although the agency frequently follows the advice of the 26 
advisory panels it maintains to review new drug applications and 
monitor existing drug use those recommendations are not binding 
fda commissioner frank young told the panel the agency has not 
found legal justification in the past for partial restriction of 
any drug approved for sale but he promised to ask lawyers to 
restudy the question 
it may be that when we revisit this we will get a different 
opinion young said 
however he acknowledged later at a news conference that an fda 
attempt to implement distribution and prescribing restrictions 
probably would be tied up in court for years by legal challenges 
from physicians 
court opinions over the years have reinforced the fdas 
traditional position that it has little legal authority over how 
doctors prescribe a drug once it is approved for sale 
under federal law regulation of the practice of medicine is 
left exclusively to the states and the longstanding legal 
interpretation is that prescribing drugs is part of the practice of 
medicine 
the daylong meeting of the fdas dermatologic drugs advisory 
committee was convened to recommend ways to avoid misuse of 
accutane 
the fda has received reports of 66 birth defects associated with 
the drug since 1982 
fortyfive of the defects were in the first two years of the 
drugs use when warnings were less severe there have been 21 
reports since 1985 when labeling cautions were strengthened 
several members of the advisory committee said they had no doubt 
the problem of misuse leading to birth defects was greater than 
reported to the fda 
however they questioned the validity of a projection based on a 
study of medicare patients in michigan which concluded that there 
may have been as many as 1300 instances of birth defects related 
to the drug nationwide 
those projections were based on a series of statistical 
projections based on just three actual cases of accutanerelated 
birth defects among michigan medicaid recipients over a threeyear 
period

irancontra defendant oliver north still 
controls nearly 3000 pages of topsecret notes he made while 
working at the white house and has never fully shown them to 
federal investigators says a senator who wants the papers for an 
international drug trafficking probe 
sen john kerry dmass said the notes which north made during 
the years he oversaw a clandestine resupply effort for nicaraguas 
contra rebels remain in the possession of norths lawyer brendan 
sullivan kerry said they have been shared with authorities only 
after north and sullivan blacked out large portions deemed by them 
to be secret or irrelevant 
kerry said tuesday that his congressional panel is subpoenaing 
the notes taken by north the former national security council aide 
who is under indictment on conspiracy charges growing out of the 
irancontra scandal 
i will not accept any determination of relevance made by 
sullivan or north kerry said as the senate foreign relations 
committee voted 161 for the subpoena kerry said he would only 
accept unexpurgated copies of the notebooks 
he has no right to be telling us what is or isnt relevant 
he added 
one of the themes of norths defense is that forcing him to 
stand trial will make public some of the nations bestkept secrets 
about covert operations 
kerry said he was making no claim that the deletions were 
inappropriate or that sullivan and north are hiding anything in the 
classified documents 
the issue is one of investigation he said vowing to pursue 
the subpoena in court if necessary 
kerrys narcotics subcommittee has been investigating 
allegations that the contra resupply network was connected to a 
latin american drugtrafficking network and that us officials 
condoned the illicit activity because they were intent on keeping 
the contras in food and weapons 
the irancontra committees were given access to norths 
notebooks but only after 1269 of the 2848 pages were fully or 
partly blacked out by north and sullivan or later by white house 
censors 
kerry released 74 heavily censored pages from the notebooks on 
tuesday sprinkled throughout were references to drugs the us 
drug enforcement agency and the cia there are mentions of 
panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio noriega who has been indicted 
in the united states on drug charges and of others connected with 
nicaragua who are alleged to have been involved in drug trafficking 
and there are references to kerry and members of his staff 
indicating north seemed to be aware of and concerned about the 
congressional investigation 
because of the extensive deletions however it is difficult to 
know how significant the passages are 
for example an entry from the may 12 1984 says cia latin 
american chief duane clarridge had called and indicated that 
name deleted contact indicates that gustavo is involved with 
drugs it is unclear to whom gustavo refers 
a july 24 1984 entry states clarridge paragraph deleted 
arturo cruz jr get alfredo cesar on drugs 
the entrys meaning is unclear cruz is the son of a former 
member of the directorate of the united nicaraguan opposition at 
that time the contra political umbrella cesar now a member of the 
contra political directorate was at the time associated with a 
contra group which was at odds with uno 
on the foreign relations panel only sen jesse helms rnc 
voted against issuing the subpoena saying he did so because he 
believed that north already bears too heavy a legal burden

children who need permanent homes and people 
who long to be parents often miss each other in the morass of red 
tape and expense of the adoption process witnesses told a 
congressional panel 
the result is youngsters who spend years in foster care 
especially those who have special needs such as minorities the 
handicapped or carriers of the aids virus 
faith daniels a cbs news correspondent who is a coanchor of 
the networks morning news program said at tuesdays hearing by 
the congressional coalition on adoption that federal help is needed 
to make the process easier for children and adults 
given what has happened in the world of adoption today my 
parents probably could not have been able to afford to adopt me 
she said i might have found a wealthier home but i couldnt 
have possibly found a more loving one 
ms daniels was born in a home for unwed mothers spent six 
months in an orphanage and was adopted at the age of seven months 
by steve and mary skowronski of washington pa 
her adoptive mother died last september and ms daniels spoke 
through tears as she described her parents there are no better 
parents than two people who make the commitment to adopt 
according to federal statistics more than 140000 children are 
adopted each year but there are more than 280000 supported by 
federal and state foster care funding of those 36000 are legally 
free and waiting for adoption nearly half of those are blacks 
hispanics native americans or children with special needs 
increasingly social service agencies face the problem of 
children who carry the aids virus said sister maureen joyce 
executive director of community maternity services in albany ny 
those children who often languish for months in hospitals will 
need services for the rest of their lives she said 
an estimated 2 million couples of childbearing age are seeking 
to adopt in addition to about 1 million single people according 
to the department of health and human services 
ernesto loperena president of the north american council on 
adoptable children in new york said that children in new york 
often wait six years in foster homes before being adopted he 
attributed the problem to getting families through the system 
and adoption agency workers who often have ingrained ideas about 
what constitutes an ideal family 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo noted that the cost of 
adoptions runs between 5000 and 10000 and can go much higher 
the expenses are not tax deductible 
she said she supports legislation to ensure unpaid but 
jobprotected leaves of absence for parents following the adoption 
of a child in addition she said families should not be barred 
from adoption because both parents must work 
many agencies require one of the parents to be home for a 
while to go through the bonding process with the child the 
problem is weve got so many women in the workplace not because 
they want to be but because they have to pay the mortgage she 
said

four days 
jeremy tubb and john fischer beat the previous record of 110 
hours 40 minutes at 740 am tuesday and ended their streak at 
336 pm after 118 hours and 36 minutes said daniel macalpine a 
college spokesman 
the two had planned to toss the disk until 5 pm tuesday but 
were beginning to hallucinate because of lack of sleep macalpine 
said 
tubb of oklahoma city and fischer of maplewood nj played 
catch on a green between two dormitory buildings during daytime 
hours and moved inside a student center building between 9 pm and 
6 am 
they were entitled to a fiveminute break every hour but 
accumulated their time to take a nap at 6 am each morning 
the old record was set by jamie knerr and keith ziery between 
aug 2327 1981 in allentown pa according to the guinness book 
of world records 
to beat the record they had to make a 45foot toss at least 
13282 times within the time period the rules permitted record 
challengers to drop the flying disk but no one could help them 
retrieve it 
cyd smith assistant editor of the guinness book in new york

between paris and istanbul will be taking a 12400mile 23day 
sentimental journey from paris to hong kong next fall the longest 
train ride in history 
a japanese television network announced tuesday that it will 
charter the venerable train for a jaunt into the record books with 
stops in cologne east berlin warsaw moscow novosibirsk irkutsk

the worlds longest train trip according to spokesmen for the fuji 
television network 
guinness lists the nineday journey from lisbon to khabarovsk in 
the soviet union as the longest rail journey on record 
orient express 88 is being sponsored by fuji in honor of the 
networks 30th anniversary publicists for fuji said the 16car 
train will depart paris on sept 2 and is scheduled to arrive in

worker benefits are growing at a higher rate 
than wages with escalating health insurance costs accounting for 
most of the increase the government says 
basic wage rates over the past 12 months have risen 26 percent 
for union workers and 35 percent for nonunion employees the 
bureau of labor statistics said tuesday 
but when benefits are included the overall hourly cost of labor 
in private industry increases at 39 percent for union members and 
4 percent for nonunion members 
some of these benefits have turned into entitlements and just 
like the government a lot of businesses have lost control of 
them said richard belous a labor economist for the conference 
board a business research house 
benefit increases in the 12 months ending april 1 have average 
58 percent overall in private industry double the 29 percent 
increase of the previous 12 months said the labor department 
statisticians 
and among bluecollar workers benefit cost increases have 
nearly tripled from a 23 percent gain a year ago to 68 percent 
the past 12 months in manufacturing noncash worker benefits rose 
7 percent in the past year compared with just 15 percent a year 
earlier 
the us chamber of commerce estimates that employee fringe 
benefits such as pension and health and dental insurance plans now 
comprise an average 40 percent of a companys labor costs 
the government said tuesday that the bulk of the increase in 
those costs in the past year was escalating health insurance 
premiums with a smaller portion coming from increased social 
security contributions by employers 
for a while it looked like many employers were containing 
health care costs said belous but in the last year a lot of 
the solutions have unraveled with mandatory health insurance on 
the horizon a lot of companies are going to have to go back to the 
drawing board 
john zalusky an economist for the aflcio said the stock 
market crash last october explains much of the difference in the 
size of benefit increases between union and nonunion workers 
union employers tend to have defined benefit pension plans 
which means that when the market crashed they had to put more 
money into the kitty he said nonunion employers have 
switched more to defined contribution plans in which the 
beneficiaries absorbed the brunt of the crash 
however zalusky acknowledged that unions also are being sent 
signals from their members to get more benefits and job security 
rather than cash at the bargaining table despite nominally lower 
tax rates 
just last month officials of the teamsters union were told by 
180000 members to take back a contract just negotiated with the 
trucking industry and swap some of the pay increase for bigger 
employer contributions to health and pension plans 
many of those benefits such as training programs and profit 
sharing bonus and employee stock ownership plans dont show up 
fully in the governments collective bargaining and employment cost 
figures zalusky said 
the worker retraining programs negotiated with ford general 
motors and atampt now constitute the largest privately endowed 
education program in the country he said and they are nowhere 
reflected in the data 
in a separate report the labor department said firstyear pay 
increases in major union contracts negotiated in the first three 
months of 1988 averaged only 21 percent excluding costofliving 
adjustments cola and lumpsum bonuses 
however excluding the 20 percent who agreed to wage freezes 
often in exchange for profitsharing stock ownership or bonus 
arrangements the average increase under the new contracts was 27 
percent the department said 
including the cola payments and lumpsum or profitsharing 
bonuses from other older contracts the average effective wage 
increase over the past 12 months under collective bargaining 
agreements has been 38 percent the government said 
that compares favorably with both the 24 percent effective wage 
increase a year earlier for union members and the 35 percent gain 
the past 12 months for nonunion workers 
earlier government data showed that union workers last year 
maintained a roughly 36 percent wage advantage over nonunion 
workers 465 a week vs 342 in 1987

sen bob dole says reporters covering the 1988 
presidential election treat democrats better than republicans 
because the journalists see the world through liberalcolored 
glasses 
the kansas republican said in a floor speech tuesday that 
there has long been a double standard when it comes to political 
coverage 
why the double standard well look at the newsrooms dole 
said lets face it they tend to be liberal in all honesty how 
many republicans are out there covering the candidates or 
congress 
dole who has dropped out of the race for the gop presidential 
nomination said reporters try to be objective but try as they 
do they just cant help but see the world through liberalcolored 
glasses 
maybe its all the result of the vietnam years or watergate 
fallout or some kind of generational distrust of republicans 
dole said 
dole said a usa today study of television news reveals that 
republican candidates received far more negative treatment than the 
democratic candidates 
this trend however was not limited to the tv screen dole 
said in my view it was prevalent in the major newspapers and 
the weekly news magazines too 
he said overall coverage of the primaries has been issueless 
and negative 
unfortunately the american people are not getting what they 
want at least not from the news media dole said 
its a shame the media cant keep up with the people he 
said what i witnessed generally on my own campaign plane was an 
aircraft filled with reporters who became each others best 
audience it was an ultrainsiders game of gossip and nitpicking 
that turned presidential campaign coverage into trivial pursuits 
it was a daily spin from the experts on the state of the 
campaign whether it came from a reporter who had been on board for 
one month or one stop dole said it didnt matter 
preconceived notions prewritten stories and premeditated cliches 
were all confirmed regardless of the facts

the chairman of the national transportation 
safety board says inspections are urgently needed for bridges built 
like the new york state thruway span that collapsed last year 
killing 10 people 
we know there are 43000 bridges around the country that have 
not been inspected even in the last two years ntsb chairman jim 
burnett said tuesday many of those that have been inspected 
during that period may not have gotten underwater inspection 
we believe there are many other bridges perhaps thousands 
in the country that were built basically as the schoharie creek 
bridge was 
burnett recommended that the federal highway administration 
require the states to inspect such bridges as quickly as 
possible 
burnett made his remarks after the board completed its yearlong 
investigation into the collapse of the schoharie creek bridge on 
the gov thomas e dewey thruway about 40 miles northwest of 
albany ny 
the span fell april 5 1987 after days of heavy rain and 
flooding four cars and one tractortrailer truck plunged into the 
creek and one body has never been recovered 
the board concluded that the probable cause of the disaster was 
failure by the new york state thruway authority to replace riprap 
or large boulders around bridge piers 
some of the boulders washed away leading to severe erosion in 
the creek bed beneath the bridge footings thatin turn caused a 
pier to buckle and the entire bridge to give way a report by the 
ntsb staff concluded 
the ntsbs conclusion differed from that of the state disaster 
preparedness commission last december primarily in that the 
federal agency pointed a finger at the state thruway authority the 
riprap problem had been uncovered during investigations and 
hearings last year 
the thruway authority had not yet seen the report and would not 
comment spokesman arthur isabel said from albany ny

projects selected from 203 proposed by agency scientists in 
laboratories and research centers across the country she said 
the 100 new research associates will be offered salaries ranging 
from 27716 to 33218 per year 
our associates provide a steady flow of new ideas and 
techniques to help us solve significant problems in food and 
agriculture carter said for example thanks to one of the 
first research associates were about to test a new cattle vaccine 
in cooperation with a california biotech firm that researcher now 
works at our us livestock insects laboratory in kerrville 
texas 
each year an award is given by the agency for the most 
outstanding project proposal this years was won by animal 
physiologist lawrence a johnson who is working on selecting the 
sex of livestock before birth at the agencys animal reproduction 
laboratory beltsville md 
other projects selected for the research associate program 
include

cold wet weather has slowed spring planting 
and crop development in a large part of the nations farmbelt says 
the governments joint agricultural weather facility 
precipitation slowed planting in the central and southern 
great plains delta and southeast the facility reported tuesday 
the cold weather slowed wheat growth in the northern and central 
great plains and corn belt 
dry conditions continued to hamper winter wheat growth in the 
northern plains while disease and insects were the main problems 
in central areas 
the facility which is operated by the departments of 
agriculture and commerce said corn planting was about 15 percent 
completed in the major producing states by april 24 ahead of the 
11 percent pace of a year ago and the longterm average progress of 
9 percent by this time 
planting was under way in all states except michigan and south 
dakota the report said seeding surpassed the average in 
nearly all states although belownormal and sometimes freezing 
temperatures slowed planting in some corn belt states

the cure for almost all of the 20 million 
american men suffering from impotence is in the doctors office 
not on the psychiatrists couch according to a boston specialist 
dr irwin goldstein associate professor of urology at the 
boston university school of medicine said at a seminar tuesday 
that the most frequent cause of impotence is blood circulation 
problems that do not allow patients to acquire or retain an 
erection 
in almost no cases he said is the problem exclusively in the 
mind a concept that has long been a popular belief 
whether there is a freudian subconscious thing that can cause 
penile insufficiency i really doubt that goldstein said at a 
national kidney foundation seminar for the most part 
psychological factors are usually secondary to other problems 
in most clinical treatments he said the urologist has 
replaced the psychologist and psychiatrist as the treatment 
specialist for impotence 
an erection goldstein said is essentially a function of 
hydraulics following appropriate inspiration a neurotransmitter 
substance is secreted to start the sequence next blood flowing 
into the penis is prevented by muscle action from flowing back out 
structures called the lecunar space then fill and force enlargement 
of the organ 
the process can be blocked by three general mechanisms a 
failure to initiate caused by impaired release of the 
neurotransmitter substances a failure to fill caused by impaired 
blood flow into the organ and a failure to store caused by an 
impairment that does not allow the blood to fill the lecunar space 
and force enlargement 
goldstein said injection of a medication that triggers muscle 
action to prevent blood from flowing out of the penis has been 
successful in overcoming impotence in 350 patients at his clinic 
he said patients or their spouses routinely learn how to administer 
the injection and the technique has been generally successful in 
appropriate cases 
another solution involves the surgical repair of arterial blood 
flow goldstein said this can involve removing blockages from the 
cavernosal artery that supplies the penis or in the case of 
injury reconnecting severed arteries still another solution is to 
surgically alter the return flow of blood which would enable it to 
pool and cause an erection 
if such solutions fail or are inappropriate goldstein said 
there is the penile implant a mechanical device that will force an 
erection he said this has been effective 90 percent of the time 
infection and device malfunction have been the only major 
problems 
vascular problems the same kind that cause heart disease are 
by far the major cause of impotence he said 
impotence may be the first indication of cardiovascular 
disease goldstein said 
this means he said that a lifestyle such as smoking and 
highfat diets that can lead to heart disease may first lead to a 
disappointing sexual life 
cigarette smoking and a high cholesterol diet are all bad for 
sexual function he said

congress must soon raise military salaries or 
accept a decline in readiness as more officers and enlisted 
personnel decide against reenlisting because of financial 
uncertainty the navys top officer says 
its a problem that i think this country is going to have to 
wake up to pretty soon if theyre going to maintain their ready 
forces said adm carlisle ah trost the chief of naval 
operations in an interview 
trost acknowledged that he was running up against congressional 
efforts to cope with the national deficit by trimming the budget 
but he said 
the big thing that people do not understand is that when you 
dont retain a trained person you dont save money by bringing in 
an untrained person it costs you several times anywhere from two 
to 10 times as much to retrain a replacement than it does 
to provide the special bonuses that were required to retain the guy 
you had on board 
congress is also cutting the budget for operations and 
maintenance to inadequate levels the fourstar admiral said 
readiness is a hard thing to measure trost said you 
dont put a dollar figure on readiness generally because no one can 
appreciate that 
what they appreciate is the fact that in last weeks 
engagements with iran for example everything went right for our 
guys and wrong for the other guy he continued 
had it been the other way around you can imagine the hue and 
cry wed hear in this town right now he said and the only 
solution would be to hack off the heads of a few people like me 
rather than blaming anybody who had any responsibility for the 
budget cuts that might have led to such a situation 
trost the navys military leader for almost two years now was 
interviewed in his pentagon office tuesday on other topics the 
58yearold admiral 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
expressed great satisfaction with the fleets performance in 
the persian gulf on april 18 when six iranian vessels were sunk or 
crippled without a single american ship being hit but he warned 
that us warships could never be expected to counter all iranian 
attacks on merchant ships in the gulf 
agreed that pentagon officials were surprised the iranians came 
out to fight last week after the united states destroyed two 
offshore platforms in retaliation for the mining of the frigate 
samuel b roberts 
disclosed that the three sailors missing from last sundays 
explosion and fire aboard the diesel submarine bonefish were on 
watch in the ships control room and were last seen there 
so it may well be that they simply ensured that everyone got 
clear and they themselves didnt make it 
in discussing military salaries trost dismissed a recent 
general accounting office report suggesting servicemen were better 
paid than civil service workers 
the average civil servant in washington is earning a 
considerably higher salary than the guy who deploys for six months 
at a time or the guy whos just had his ship mined or the guy whose 
submarine just exploded trost said

placido domingo one of the biggest draws in 
opera has pulled out of the title role in wagners lohengrin 
this summer at the royal opera house covent garden the management 
said 
domingo was to have sung in five performances from june 20 
through july 6 and covent garden was depending on him to be the 
big attraction of its season 
his appearance also was to be a sendoff for sir john tooley 
the retiring general director for whom domingo has sung in each of 
his seasons since 1970 
an opera house statement issued tuesday said domingo decided to 
withdraw lohengrin from his repertoire for the moment 
he reached the decision with great regret but since he has not 
sung it on stage recently he would need more time than he has 
available to reprepare the role the statement said

thousands of aliens are jamming us immigration centers as the 
amnesty programs deadline loomed a week from today and officials 
warned immigrants not to count on an extension of the cutoff date 
in houston there was standing room only tuesday inside the 
immigration and naturalization service office texas busiest and 
a line of applicants snaked around the building throughout the day 
officials processed about 1600 applications monday and another 
1600 tuesday about 100000 people were expected to apply for 
amnesty through the houston office by may 4 twice the number 
initially predicted 
theres too much people standing in line said marco 
canamar an applicant standing in line i dont think they have 
enough time to process all the people 
immigration officials likened the filing frenzy by aliens 
seeking legal status to the mad rush by lastminute tax filers on 
april 15 
these applicants are just like anyone else when it comes to 
procrastinating just like you and i on tax day said john roark 
an ins spokesman in dallas 
nationwide officials originally projected up to 4 million 
undocumented aliens would apply that estimate fell to 2 million 
so far the ins has received 12 million general amnesty 
applications and 400000 applications under the more liberal 
seasonal agricultural worker program 
under provisions of the immigration reform and control act of 
1986 illegal immigrants must prove they have lived in the united 
states continuously since before jan 1 1982 in order to be 
eligible for legal residency status 
the us house of representatives has passed a measure to extend 
the cutoff date from midnight may 4 to nov 30 but the bill faces 
strong opposition in the senate and a possible presidential veto 
ins officials oppose an extension of the yearlong program 
it would be sending the wrong signal that would encourage 
people not now in the country to enter the country roark said 
we would see another big surge in november if the deadline is 
approved 
democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson on tuesday urged 
congress to support an extension 
surely our great nation can find it in our hearts and souls to 
give six months more for freedom jackson said lincoln is 
watching martin luther king is watching give freedom a chance 
until recent weeks ins officials had been disappointed by the 
low number of applicants and launched a media blitz to promote the 
program the effort included radio shows a parade float street 
parties bumper stickers and billboards 
the number of applicants jumped as the deadline approached 
prompting immigration offices nationwide to extend their hours and 
stay open on weekends to process applications 
in boston 352 illegal aliens applied for amnesty during the 
week of april 10 and 400 applied last week 
those were both record weeks for us said roger nye 
director of the ins amnesty program in boston so far 7583 people 
have applied for amnesty and the office has recommended approving 
more than 95 percent of them 
immigrants from more than 100 countries requested amnesty in 
boston with about half hispanic a fifth haitian and a sixth 
chinese he said adding that the list included 101 irish 
nationals 166 nigerians 110 liberians and 100 poles 
in recent weeks the number of applicants has doubled in the ins 
western district comprised of california arizona nevada hawaii 
and guam 
on april 18 the western region processed 3521 new applications 
for legalization on monday it received 6802 applications said 
joyce leonard ins acting assistant director for immigration reform 
in los angeles 
in arizona alone 42247 people have applied for amnesty with 
21311 seeking legalization and 20936 applying under the special 
agricultural workers program said richard perry ins regional 
deputy director in phoenix 
im pleasantly surprised that we have had such a dramatic 
increase in the past two months perry said already we have 
received more applications in april than in any month since the 
program began

attorney general edwin meese iii says everyone 
who is arrested should be tested for drugs and then should be 
subject to followup tests before trial 
i would like to see the day where every person arrested is 
subjected to a urine test to determine suitability for pretrial 
release meese told mayors and police chiefs tuesday at the us 
conference of mayors 
he said once defendants are back on the street they should be 
subject to random drug testing to dissuade them from committing 
crimes while awaiting trial meese added he would like to see 
mandatory drug testing results taken into account in sentencing by 
judges 
meese later told a reporter a proposal embracing such an 
approach is a part of our user accountability strategy that is 
being developed at the present time by the national drug policy 
board a cabinetlevel panel which meese chairs 
if the proposal is adopted it would take legislation to 
implement the plan said justice department spokesman patrick 
korten 
meese also said mandatory drug tests ought to be administered to 
users in drug treatment programs to make them accountable 
meese said such approaches are part of the reagan 
administrations philosophy of recognizing that the user is not a 
victim as some would suggest but rather that the user is a vital 
participant in drug trafficking 
meese claimed that the proposals dont present constitutional 
problems but didnt elaborate civil liberties groups vehemently 
disagree saying that under the constitution defendants are 
supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty 
a constitutional challenge to pretrial testing of criminal 
suspects in the district of columbia is before a us district 
court in washington 
ira glasser executive director of the american civil liberties 
union denounced meeses comments in a telephone interview from his 
new york city home tuesday night 
all of meeses statements over the years are designed to sound 
tough on crime but are not tough on crime glasser said 
he should understand as well as anybody that being a suspect 
youre not guilty of anything 
regarding the proposal for workplace drug testing glasser said 
these proposals threaten the innocent more than they do the 
guilty 
despite his tough talk meese came under sharp questioning from 
several democratic mayors who questioned whether he is doing an 
adequate job of directing the nations war on drugs 
the mayors and police chiefs say more federal aid for drug 
education and law enforcement is needed to combat trafficking and 
that the united states should stop sending foreign aid to countries 
that continue to allow drugs to flow from their nations to the 
united states 
the policy by the federal government isnt a policy 
providence ri mayor joseph paolino complained to meese 
we dont see how the federal government is really working in 
partnership with the communities said paolino maybe it is on 
paper maybe it is in structure but it isnt in reality 
meese responded that the reagan administration is working on 
drug eradication and interdiction programs with governments in 
several south american countries in an attempt to cut the supply of 
cocaine into the united states by up to 50 percent over three years 
meese said justice department officials will be glad to meet 
with the mayors and city police chiefs as often as you want to 
discuss drugfighting strategies 
new orleans mayor sidney j barthelemy argued the federal 
government should appoint a drug czar whose sole responsibility is 
to direct the attack on drug trafficking and use 
i have the same power with regard to narcotics and the 
national drug policy board as the surgeon general has with regard 
to aids replied meese 
meese told the group that 33 congressional panels have 
jurisdiction over the drug problem 
those generals that youre talking about are spending more of 
their time testifying before a variety of committees in congress 
than they are leading the charge against narcotics said meese

a knock on the door in the middle of the 
evening then the dreaded words sanitation police 
new york may have trouble educating its children or maintaining 
its bridges but when the city says post no bills it means it 
the sanitation department has embarked on a campaign to enforce 
a law against placing posters on public property including any 
gutter flagstone tree lamppost awning post telegraph pole 
telephone pole public utility pole garbage bin bus shelter 
elevated train structure highway fence barrel box or hydrant 
not to mention city hall 
a team of sanitation police has been going from door to door 
issuing summonses with fines between 50 and 250 
during the past six months the city has issued more than 15000 
summonses and collected about 142000 in fines according to vito 
turso sanitation department spokesman 
sanitation officers do not carry guns only summons pads and 
twoway radios which theyve had to use to fend off some 
offenders turso said there hasnt been any violence but 
theyre treated like the grim reaper 
one of those served was michael barry a music teacher whose 
home was visited by three sanitation policemen one night in 
february they left behind 61 summonses worth 50 each for guitar 
and piano lesson ads tacked to utility poles in manhattans east 
village section 
through newspaper ads barry reached other alleged offenders and 
formed the victims of poster police to fight the sanctions a may 4 
demonstration is planned outside sanitation headquarters 
the city administrative code provision passed in september 
differs from the previous law in that it imposes strict liability 
for the posters on whoever is named on them in the past 
authorities had to catch someone in the act of posting 
but kenneth lo a brooklyn kung fu instructor said he was fined 
1000 for 22 leaflets tacked up by a 10yearold student he 
claims he wasnt even aware they were being put up 
illegal posting charges are considered by the citys 
environmental control board which has dismissed quite a few of 
the cases according to board spokeswoman tina casey 
barry said the fines are unfair and the law is an 
unconstitutional restriction on expression 
turso was unsympathetic these people are visually polluting 
new york city he said they should consider buying billboard 
space 
a billboard may not be a realistic medium for music teachers or 
palm readers but turso said the posters environmental impact must 
be considered 
they not only tack or tape them to telephone poles they glue 
them he complained that makes it almost impossible to get 
off

vienna austria if seven independent oilproducing nations and 
opec adopt a proposal to cut their exports by 5 percent they could 
reverse the recent decline in oil prices caused by excess supplies 
an analyst said 
if they agreed to it it would be very positive for the oil 
market said paul mlotok an analyst for the investment firm 
salomon brothers inc who was in vienna to observe talks between 
the two groups 
the proposal was made tuesday if it is adopted it will be the 
first such accord with outside oil producers in opecs 28year 
history 
on the new york mercantile echange on tuesday contracts for 
june delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude 
closed 20 cents higher at 1860 per barrel partly in reaction to 
reports of the proposal 
mexicos oil minister fernando hiriart said he conveyed the 
offer to representatives of the 13member organization of petroleum 
exporting countries on behalf of mexico and six other independent 
oil producers egypt china colombia malaysia oman and angola 
speaking through an interpreter hiriart told reporters the 
suggested cutbacks would be for may and june only he added that 
the basis for calculating the reductions would be the average oil 
export level of each country over the past six months 
hiriart said his government shares opecs objective of 
driving prices back up to the cartels official target of 18 per 
barrel most opec oil currently is selling for 14 to 15 a barrel 
rilwanu lukman of nigeria the president of opec called the 
offer a good beginning 
the independent producers presented their offer at a meeting 
with six opec members the two groups were scheduled to meet again 
this afternoon for a final day of closeddoor deliberations 
venezuelas oil minister arturo hernandez grisanti told 
reporters the six opec officials were not authorized to make any 
decisions on the nonopec offer he said details of the proposal 
would be passed on to all opec countries at a meeting in vienna on 
thursday 
hiriart declined to say what mexico or the other independent 
producers would do if opec did not agree to the offer 
we are ready to implement these measures when we find the 
adequate proportional response from opec hiriart said adding 
that this meant a volume cut equivalent to 5 percent of its 
exports 
he said a 5 percent cut by the nonopec group would amount to 
about 200000 barrels a day he added it was unclear exactly what 
the 5 percent reduction for opec would amount to in barrels per day 
opec exports about 14 million barrels of its collective oil 
production of between 175 million and 18 million barrels a day a 
5 percent cut would appear to mean an export reduction of 700000 
barrels daily 
opec itself is sharply divided about whether to reduce its 
production although it has long welcomed collaborative efforts by 
independent oil producers 
one of the main obstacles to an opec agreement on reducing its 
oil output is iraqs refusal to cooperate iraq is not party to an 
existing opec productionlimiting agreement because its demand for 
a production quota equal to that of iran was denied the two 
nations have been at war since 1980 
iraq is believed to be pumping at least 25 million barrels 
daily more than any other opec member except saudi arabia iran 
produces roughly 2 million barrels daily 
a further complication for opec is saudi arabias decision 
tuesday to break diplomatic relations with iran although this was 
not expected to stop the oil ministers of both countries from 
sitting together at the opec negotiating table it could cast a 
shadow over efforts to agree on cartel policy moves 
regardless of the outcome of opecs talks with the independent 
producers members of both groups said the meetings were important 
for the longterm development of the world oil market 
it is the beginning of a new stage of cooperation between a 
large number of oilproducing countries hiriart said it is 
hoped that other countries will join in the effort

the metropolitan opera filed a lawsuit seeking 
to ring down the curtain on a bebop jazz band that calls itself 
the metropolitan bopera house 
in its trademark infringement suit against the jazz quintet the 
met claimed the virtually identical name is likely to cause 
confusion deception mistake 
but john marshall one of the founding members of the 
metropolitan bopera house called tuesdays lawsuit pretty silly 
because were no threat to them in any way after all were playing 
different kinds of music 
bebop is a form of improvisational swing popularized by charlie 
bird parker and dizzy gillespie said marshall 
henry w lauterstein general counsel for the met declined to 
comment further saying hed let court papers call the tune 
the lawsuit filed in us district court seeks a restraining 
order against metropolitan bopera house to keep them from 
unfairly competing with the met 
after playing smokefilled dates and struggling to assert 
itself in the rough jazz business it is difficult for our group to 
see how we could possibly threaten the opera which seems to feel 
it has exclusive rights to the word metropolitan said 
marshall a 35yearold trumpeter from brooklyn 
the opera house also wants the bopera house to turn over all 
their records labels advertising and anything else with the 
offending name for destruction 
according to the lawsuit the metropolitan opera has been the 
metropolitan opera since 1883 and even registered that name and 
met as trademarks the met also sought an accounting of 
metropolitan bopera houses profits and unspecified damages for 
alleged willful and wanton unfair competition and unfair 
business practices 
the lawsuit claimed the boppers obviously intended to connote 
a connection or association with the met and were stealing its 
name good will and reputation 
not so said marshall noting that his band founded 100 years 
after the met took its moniker from a nickname for the royal 
roost a popular manhattan jazz club of the 1940s

the reagan administration is trying to 
negotiate an agreement under which panamas gen manuel antonio 
noriega would retain power for a time rather than go into immediate 
exile a published report says 
the washington post reported today the compromise plan was 
presented last week to the military strongman by michael kozak 
deputy assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
the report which cites unidentified us and diplomatic 
sources says the plan backs away from administration demands for 
noriegas immediate ouster as commander of the panamanian defense 
forces 
state department spokeswoman ellen bork had no comment on 
kozaks trip to panama but said there has been no change in the 
administrations position that noriega has to step down and leave 
panama unconditionally at once kozak did not return telephone 
calls to his residence late tuesday 
in another development white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said tuesday the administration was considering some exemptions to 
the order prohibiting payments to panama by us citizens and 
companies operating there 
the spokesman in remarks to reporters described them as 
hardship case exemptions and denied the administration was 
considering a sweeping reduction of its sanctions directed against 
noriega 
as part of its attempt to oust noriega the administration cut 
off all economic and military aid last year earlier this year it 
withheld fees for use of the panama canal and barred us banks 
from transferring fees to the noriega regime 
noriega is under indictment in florida on drugtrafficking 
charges 
on april 8 reagan invoked the international emergency economic 
act which barred us citizens companies and their subsidiaries 
from making any payments to the panamanian government 
fitzwater said no decision had yet been made on exemptions to 
the act and he could offer no timetable for one 
the spokesman said the exemptions would allow payments for such 
things as rent and garbage bills so as not to make conditions 
unduly hard on us small businesses and citizens operating in 
panama 
asked if the exemptions amounted to an admission by the 
administration that its sanctions had not been able to force 
noriega from office fitzwater said this is a signal to noriega 
that the other sanctions are staying this means were 
settling in for the long term 
he said that when the april 8 decision was announced the 
administration said it would consider exemptions to the order

michael dukakis showed new strength in the 
pennsylvania primary drawing support from elements of the 
democratic party as disparate as jesse jackson voters and the 
reagan democrats of 1984 exit polls say 
the massachusetts governor for the first time tuesday found a 
majority of his backers supporting him strongly the polls said 
dukakis whose margin of victory was better than 21 won every 
group but blacks who favored jackson almost unanimously 
still twothirds of jacksons voters said they would support 
dukakis as the nominee against george bush in november an abc 
newswashington post poll said and a cbs newsnew york times poll 
said 58 percent of jacksons backers expressed a favorable view of 
dukakis 
if i were in dukakis campaign id be jumping for joy said 
cbs news pollster keating holland hes going to have a good 
strong candidacy hes not going to be a default candidate by any 
means 
while many jackson voters showed a willingness to support 
dukakis so did democrats at the other end of the spectrum those 
who voted for president reagan in 1984 twothirds of them in the 
cbstimes poll and threequarters in the abcpost poll said they 
would back dukakis over bush in november 
what were seeing here is dukakis showing an ability to pull 
together the democratic electorate said abc poll analyst doug 
muzzio hes bringing democrats back home from reagan and even 
though the electorate is bifurcated hes showing an ability to pull 
jacksons supporters to him for november 
the democratic electorate still was divided sharply along racial 
lines with jackson drawing support from about 95 percent of the 
blacks and less than 15 percent of the whites his share of the 
white vote was well under the 20percentplus range he reached in 
wisconsin connecticut and vermont 
dukakis backers were wary of jackson in the cbstimes poll 59 
percent of them viewed jackson unfavorably and in the abcpost 
poll only 24 percent of dukakis voters said they would support 
jackson as the nominee against bush fortythree percent favored 
bush and 33 percent said they would not vote 
in another measure an nbc news exit poll found white democrats 
split on whether jacksons candidacy was good for the party 
thirtysix percent said jackson helped the party by running and 36 
percent said he hurt it 
dukakis has to be very careful about embracing jackson because 
hes got a lot of people who dont like him said ia lewis 
pollster for the los angeles times dukakis has a tightrope hes 
walking here he has to be careful not because of the blacks 
but because of his own supporters 
whatever his future problems pollsters said dukakis newfound 
strength was a striking feature of the pennsylvania vote the 
cbstimes poll found that 52 percent of his voters said they backed 
him strongly the first time more than half his support was strong 
while onefifth of dukakis voters said they were backing him 
chiefly to stop jackson that was well down from onethird in the 
new york primary last week the abcpost poll said and it said 
dukakis had moved in for the first time on some of jacksons issues 
dukakis won half the voters who cited the poor and elderly as 
their chief concerns groups that jackson won strongly in earlier 
contests muzzio said dukakis also edged jackson among voters who 
cited strong leadership and ability to make a change groups that 
jackson usually won previously 
dukakis is consolidating his support and its coalescing hes 
moving into jackson issues muzzio said hes making rather 
dramatic inroads into issues of concern to what had been jackson 
voters 
nbcs poll said 80 percent of democrats think dukakis will be 
the partys nominee and even 49 percent of jackson voters expect 
dukakis to win in all roughly threequarters of democrats said 
they viewed dukakis favorably 
hes emerging as the consensus candidate lewis said the 
next step is going to be binding the wounds pulling the party 
together and getting it directed against the republicans 
the nbc and cbstimes polls had a margin of sampling error of 2 
points the abcpost poll 3 points

compared to 58 for runification 
the new democratic republicans an opposition party led by kim 
jongpil a former prime minister won 35 seats in the new assembly 
democratic justice had been expected to maintain its control of 
the legislature because of divisions among the opposition parties 
opposition control of the assembly will have added impact under 
a new constitution that took effect in february when roh started a 
fiveyear term after winning office in december balloting with 36 
percent of the vote 
under the constitution adopted after antigovernment

southern cheju island with 39 percent of the vote 
the station part of the mbc network said the report 
accidentally went on the air during a rehearsal for tuesdays 
election coverage 
the station apologized to the nation and said two employees had 
been fired and four suspended prosecutors said they were 
investigating to determine if election laws had been violated

government had manipuated votecounting computers before any 
ballots were cast 
in the actual count tuesday hyun led at first but then trailed 
cheju news reports said an estimated 1000 people demonstrated 
after the polls closed shouting nullify the elections 
yonhap said that earlier in the day 600 protesters attacked a

was burned as riot squads fired tear gas at the demonstrators

hes a loudmouthed whining pitchman in his 
television commercials but auto dealer jolly john pulsifer has 
bigger plans than just sending you home in a creampuff 
having parlayed 2000 and a memorable television persona into 
the areas fastestgrowing auto dealership network pulsifer is 
planning a chain of 20 or more dealerships stretching from bangor 
to bucharest romania that is 
pulsifers flailing arms elastic face and loud nasal whine 
and such trademark lines as youre gonna love it and im not 
jolly unless youre happy have made him a familiar figure on tv 
screens across southern maine 
his local dealerships however are just part of a longterm 
plan to expand throughout the region and beyond 
we will be the largest megadealer or chain operator in new 
england as early as this year pulsifer says projecting his 
sales could grow to between 120 million and 150 million in 1988 
from 80 million in 1987 
the 51yearold portland native who worked for a halfdozen 
dealers during a 20year career as a car salesman opened his own 
used car business in 1979 with 2000 in severance pay from his 
last employer 
he opened his first new car dealership six years ago in this 
southern maine city of 14000 taking over a faltering ford 
franchise during the depths of the last recession 
in 1985 he added a lincolnmercury dealership and a used car 
outlet and in the past few months has bought a subaru and 
volkswagen dealership and opened a 25000squarefoot truck center 
pulsifer says his six saco dealerships which sold roughly 9000 
new and used cars last year attract customers from a 100mile 
radius many of them in response to his radio and tv ads 
not everybody is going to be willing to hold themselves up to 
ridicule but hey why take yourself that seriously i mean 
thats stupid he said in an interview his voice rising in pitch 
as he warmed to the subject 
i mean am i a nuclear physicist no im just a car 
salesman 
jolly john has announced plans for the regions first auto mall 
a 15 million to 20 million 245acre complex housing seven 
dealerships a restaurant a 400seat auditorium and a sixstory 
headquarters building here 
he also is negotiating to acquire existing dealerships in the 
portland and bangor markets and operate them under the jolly john 
name the first in a regional chain he plans to extend into new 
hampshire 
the growth of pulsifers businesses mirrors what analysts call a 
nationwide trend toward auto dealership consolidation as the profit 
margin shrinks on cars cramping the smaller singleline dealer 
its really forcing those smaller dealers to take other 
costcutting measures and part of that is selling out to a 
megadealer who can do it a whole lot easier says jean 
pellegrino administrator of dealer services for jd power 
associates in agoura hills calif 
although goofy ads and free jolly john masks at his dealerships 
have drawn buyers in maine pulsifer will tone down his marketing 
style for a jolly john ford dealership he plans to open in downtown 
bucharest in the next year or so 
he is negotiating that deal through his participation in a joint 
venture with the communist government to import a fourwheeldrive 
utility vehicle known as the aro pulsifer a member of a 
mainebased group involved in the aro project has been named us 
distributor for the vehicle 
the bucharest dealership will use the jolly john name but steer 
clear of his personalized pitchman image instead pulsifer will 
team up with the romanian national soccer team serving as a team 
sponsor and erecting billboards in its home stadium

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis another landslide behind him will now turn his campaign 
to a twotrack strategy of running in primaries while focusing 
attention on his general election battle against george bush 
he intends to spend some time campaigning in texas during may 
even though the primary was held there in march the state will be 
a critical one to his election chances in the fall 
and he is considering a commencement address at a predominantly 
black college as a way of beginning to expand his meager support 
among jesse jacksons black constituency whose voters he needs to 
be elected in the fall 
a trip or two to washington is also likely next month so dukakis 
can be seen conferring with democratic leaders of congress just as 
vice president george bush intends to summon republican experts to 
his home in kennebunkport maine during june 
bush has been running this sort of twoinone campaign ever 
since he routed his republican rivals more than a month ago by 
winning the final few delegates needed to mathematically clinch his 
own nomination he is free to pick up president reagans formal 
blessing the most coveted republican endorsement of all 
even before the votes were counted in pennsylvania tuesday 
night bush had begun stirring his antidemocratic rhetoric with an 
antidukakis elixir the vice president said the democratic 
frontrunner lacks foreign policy experience 
that will be a major issue in the fall said the former cia 
director un ambassador and head of the us delegation to the 
peoples republic of china 
he added in an interview with the washington post the 
country does not want to move left they do not want to go back to 
the malaise days of jimmy carter so long as it works 
republicans enjoy trotting out the former president as a campaign 
whipping boy never mind that dukakis has no known relationship to 
carter 
bushs campaign manager lee atwater more pungent than his boss 
summarizes the republican campaign message with a single 
wellturned phrase americans he says dont want a 
northernfried jimmy carter 
dukakis whose caution is legendary publicly resists any 
attempt by bush or anyone else to portray him as what he is the 
prohibitive favorite to gain the democratic nomination most 
probably on the first ballot at a unified convention 
in the hour of his pennsylvania landslide more lopsided than 
the one accorded him at home in the massachusetts primary he 
pointed out that walter mondale stumbled four years ago after 
winning primaries in new york and pennsylvania 
but for all the public disclaimers he and his aides have begun 
to pencil in a schedule for the month of may designed to appeal to 
a nationwide audience rather than a singlestate primary 
constituency 
in an associated press interview last week he worked to blunt 
bushs foreign policy offensive by resurrecting last winters 
rhetoric about a failed and illegal reagan administration 
policy in central america as well as criticizing the irancontra 
affair and policy in south africa 
the massachusetts governor also is expected to speaking about 
education and the environment two areas in which bush has sought 
gingerly to set himself apart from the reagan record 
dukakis also intends to begin fundraising for the democratic 
party nationally and the state parties in the coming weeks 
dukakis begins that phase of his campaign after next weeks 
primaries 
he intends to divide his time this coming week between the 
statehouse office in boston and upcoming primary states ohio and 
indiana his aim is to avoid a surprising defeat next tuesday that 
would raise fresh doubts about his candidacy just as democratic 
party leaders begin climbing aboard the bandwagon 
in the process he also hopes to roll up a lead of several 
hundred democratic national convention over jackson thus paving 
the way for amassing a nominating majority by the time the 
primaries end in california and new jersey on june 7 
jackson is conceded his victory in the district of columbia next 
week but the dukakis campaign expects it to be the last contest 
the massachusetts governor loses 
after the three primaries next tuesday the election calendar 
offers a natural break before the finale june 7 dukakis intends to 
campaign in may primary states such as nebraska west virginia and 
oregon but not with the intensity that marked his efforts in the 
states thus far 
instead he will turn his attention to amassing the support of 
party leaders who will be delegates at the democratic national 
convention and who hold the votes needed to assure his nomination 
delegates backing the suspended candidacies of sens paul simon and 
albert gore jr will also be targets

mayor bill boner donned a fake beard 
dark glasses blue jeans and a bulletproof vest to cruise the 
streets and buy illegal drugs from dealers peddling their wares a 
few miles from his home 
i had no idea how accessible drugs were in our community 
boner said tuesday the two areas where we made the buys are less 
than two or three miles from where i live 
boner 43 said the pushers who sold him cocaine and dilaudid 
an injectable painkiller are still at large if they police 
can go back and find them they will be arrested boner said 
the mayor said he sought out the pushers as part of an 
undercover police operation and promised to do so again to focus 
attention on nashvilles problems the city needs to do more he 
said 
we have willing buyers anxious sellers who will chase a car 
down a busy street waving drugs in the air and too few police 
officers he said 
during the three hours he was undercover last friday boner 
bought the drugs with the help of a pair of police informants 
while undercover officers in vans videotaped the deals and listened 
through an electronic bugging system 
the two informants a man and a woman in their 20s rode with 
him they were told he was an undercover police officer trying to 
learn the ropes 
going undercover is not really part of the game plan but it 
has already brought me to a higher level of understanding about the 
drug culture and how we can combat the problem of street sales to 
people who buy drugs like families driving up for hamburgers at a 
drivein restaurant boner said 
assistant police chief john ross said undercover officers were 
close by at all times to protect the mayor 
but we were relieved when it was over ross said these 
people can be very dangerous weve had a number of shootings and 
stabbings in these areas 
it was not the first time boner has disguised himself to learn 
more about the citys problems 
in june 1984 boner then a congressman went unshaven for a 
week and spent two days and nights among the homeless to learn 
about their plight he ate at the union rescue mission slept in a 
parking lot and talked to street people

austria has formally protested the united 
states refusal to cooperate in a lawsuit brought by austrian 
president kurt waldheim against a prominent american jewish leader 
according to austrian sources 
the us representative in vienna michael habib was called to 
the austrian foreign ministry last week and handed a protest note 
an austrian official said tuesday in washington 
austria also sent a letter to the us justice department said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the austrian government had asked the justice department for its 
help in questioning edgar bronfman a wealthy businessman and the 
head of the world jewish congress waldheim is suing bronfman over 
his remark last may that the austrian president was part and 
parcel of the nazi killing machine 
the united states has barred waldheim from entering this country 
because of his nazi past as an officer in the german army a 
commission of historians appointed by the austrian goverment 
concluded earlier this year that waldheim was in close 
proximity to nazi atrocities in the balkans and lied about his 
actions 
explaining its refusal to comply with the austrian request the 
justice department said that because department officials had 
developed the us case against waldheim it would be a conflict 
of interest and inappropriate for them to assist in the libel 
suit spokesman john russell said 
russell said the department had advised austria to retain a us 
lawyer to obtain the sworn depositions it wanted from bronfman 
an austrian embassy official said austria views this explanation 
as not legally based but rather politically based

a measure sought by the small aircraft 
industry to set up federal standards for accident liability is 
moving to the full senate after approval by a committee 
the measure approved by the senate commerce committee on a 
voice vote tuesday would establish federal standards for 
determining liability in an accident involving aircraft that seat 
fewer than 20 people and not flying scheduled passenger routes 
the measure would replace what industry officials and private 
plane owners complain is a hodgepodge of conflicting state laws 
manufacturers say their insurance costs have multiplied 
fivefold since 1981 as a result of that and rising court 
judgments they say number of private planes produced in this 
country has declined from a record 17000 in 1979 to 1085 last 
year

a government review panel has cleared a 
married couple at the department of health and human services of 
violating federal travel rules or taking unauthorized trips at 
government expense 
the departments ethics review board found the trips by terry 
and paget hinch had been authorized and did involve government 
business according to a report in todays washington post 
the panel said mrs hinch apparently had arranged three 
legitimate business trips so she could be near her husband at the 
resort area of orlando fla and over thanksgiving near his 
familys home in the san franciso area 
the board said the trips raised an appearance of impropriety 
and said it had sought and received voluntary reimbursement of 
3264 for some costs related to the trips

unexpected delays in assembling 
discoverys solid fuel booster rockets probably will hold up the 
first postchallenger shuttle mission at least 10 days beyond the 
planned liftoff nasa says 
the space agency will not officially make a decision on a new 
date until after the assembly process is further along said arnold 
d aldrich shuttle program director 
but he said tuesday at the 25th space congress in nearby cocoa 
beach were down probably 10 days on the projected aug 4 launch 
date 
several weeks ago the national areonautics and space 
administration set the date as an internal launch target in 
announcing that it planned an august liftoff for discovery with a 
fiveman crew 
as technicians encountered more and more delays in assembling 
the first of two booster rockets officials at the kennedy space 
center here unofficially moved the internal date to aug 13 
aldrich said that it would be later in may before a firm date 
could be established but he expressed confidence discovery could 
be launched sometime in august 
a faulty booster rocket joint that allowed flames to escape 
caused the explosion of challenger and the deaths of its seven crew 
members on jan 28 1986 the three remaining shuttles have been 
grounded while the joint and other booster components have 
undergone extensive redesign and testing at the same time 
procedures for assembling the rockets here have become more 
complicated as each step is carefully monitored 
each of discoverys two boosters is made of four solid fuel 
segments and other components that are shipped here separately from 
a morton thiokol plant in utah 
assembly of the left booster began here early this month and 
stacking of both rockets was to have been completed by this week 
but so far only three of the segments of the left booster have 
been fitted and extra time built into the schedule for problems 
has disappeared 
stacking those segments is a lot more time consuming than we 
thought it would be aldrich said everyone as you can imagine 
is being very cautious to make certain they understand all the new 
procedures and to check each move 
he said the newest projection for completing the booster 
assembly is may 22 according to that schedule he added discovery 
would be mated to the rockets and an external fuel tank on may 31 
the complete assembly would be transported to the launch pad on 
june 9 and a 20second firing of the shuttles liquidfuel main 
engines would be conducted on the pad on july 1 
leonard nicholson manager of shuttle operations at the johnson 
space center in houston said that if the discovery launch slips 
past aug 31 or if the second postchallenger mission that of 
atlantis set for oct 27 is delayed past nov 17 the third 
flight a discovery jan 19 liftoff would have to be put off 
indefinitely 
such delays would crowd the launch schedule and make it 
impossible to launch atlantis on april 27 with a magellan probe to 
venus there are only a few days in which venus is in position and 
if that launching is missed the flight would have to be put off a 
year

city counci resolved a ticklish problem by 
approving an amendment that allows members of one sex to massage 
feet of the other 
the problem came up when denise sewell opened the foot rub inn 
figuring that she could turn a buck by rubbing some of this west 
texas citys million feet 
but she learned that because of a city ordinance regulating 
massage parlors and turkish baths she could rub womens feet but 
not mens without a doctors prescription 
the council on tuesday chopped the ordinance off at the ankles 
making it legal to charge for a massage below that joint 
the original ordinance aimed at banning massage parlors with a 
penchant for providing illicit pleasures on the side prohibited a 
woman from giving a man a rubdown for pay and vice versa 
so the council members decided they didnt want to go on record 
favoring digital discrimination 
not every council member was wholeheartedly in favor of the 
amendment at least not without some clarification 
well how far up do feet go asked member suzie azar 
as far as the ankle and that was all the council removed from 
under the citys antimessage parlor ordinance 
i just believe its good for the bodys organs and just plain 
feeling good said sewell who charges 15 for a halfhour rub 
were all born with gifts and that happens to be one of mine 
im good with my hands 
councilman ed elsey says hes all in favor of foot massage 
my wife does it at no charge he said shes the best foot 
rubber in the country someone whos never participated in foot 
rubbing just wouldnt know how relaxing it is 
elsey admitted however that he had never discussed his love 
for foot rubbing in public before 
i have a lot of conservative people on the east side and they 
wouldnt understand he said

prime minister brian mulroney is fond of 
referring to canada as americas best friend and ally 
yet theres an issue left off his agenda in talks with president 
reagan that raises doubts about the depth of that friendship 
possible us opposition to canadas acquisition of nuclearpowered 
submarines 
mulroneys conservative government announced a major defense 
buildup last year including 8 billion 65 billion us for 
canadas first fleet of nuclearpowered but not nucleararmed 
submarines 
the plan is to contract for either britains trafalgarclass 
submarine or frances smaller rubisamethyste design but to build 
the majority of the 10 to 12 vessels in canada over the next 
quarter of a century 
the defense department is scheduled to make a recommendation by 
the end of may but theres a problem 
the british vessel contains us nuclear technology and the us 
congress would have to approve its transfer to a third party even 
when that third party is canada a nato and norad partner 
france which is not a military member of nato has its own 
nuclear technology and is willing to share it 
canadian officials hint at a preference for the trafalgarclass 
submarine which is slightly larger and more powerful than the 
rubis and easier to blend into a fleet that works with us and 
nato forces 
however adm kinnaird mckee director of the us navys 
nuclear propulsion agency is raising objections to the british 
transfer and sen john warner a former navy secretary is among 
capitol hill politicians who may demand hearings if the sale goes 
ahead 
us nuclear submarines now enjoy unfettered operational access 
under the arctic ice and the pentagon hoped ottawa would opt for 
conventional dieselpowered submarines 
us secretary of state george p shultz said in january that 
the reagan administration would cooperate with canadian plans but 
only under the right circumstances which he did not define 
holding up the british transfer makes canada a supplicant to its 
chief ally and that has stirred resentment in a country with a 
chronic fear of being overwhelmed by its american neighbors 
columnist jeffrey simpson of the toronto globe and mail asked 
if the americans will not trust the canadians and assist the 
british just whom will they help the paper quoted rear adm 
john anderson chief of the submarine acquisition program as 
saying it is ironic one navy thwarting another 
during a weekend interview with american correspondents 
including the associated press mulroney said he did not plan to 
discuss the issue with reagan i dont know adm mckee i never 
heard of him in my life he said 
he revealed however that prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain had intervened in hopes of securing a lucrative contract 
for vickers shipyard builders of the trafalgarclass submarine 
all i know is that mrs thatcher and the united kingdom have 
spoken to the united states and well see what happens mulroney 
said 
behind the impasse is an emotional dispute over ownership of the 
northwest passage through the canadian arctic 
defense minister perrin beatty opted for costlier 
nuclearpowered submarines because they can patrol for long periods 
in a vast region now open to intruders 
washington contends the northwest passage is an international 
waterway but mulroney says canada owns it lock stock and 
iceberg and has the right to control its use 
the issue flared in 1985 when the us icebreaker polar sea 
challenged canadian sovereignty by sailing through the passage 
followed by the appearance of us nuclear submarines around the 
north pole 
a truce was reached last january when canada conceded access to 
us icebreakers provided they give prior notice before a voyage 
but the sovereignty question was not resolved

a national democratic ticket that 
includes jesse jackson would lose in michigan and could even cost 
the party some congressional seats lt gov martha griffiths says 
griffiths told the local league of women voters in a speech 
monday night she believes the strongest ticket for the democrats in 
november would be massachusetts gov michael dukakis and sen sam 
nunn of georgia 
jackson cant be on the ticket if so he would lose us some 
seats griffiths said 
in the march 26 democratic caucuses in michigan jackson beat 
dukakis by a 2to1 margin and captured 76 national convention 
delegates to dukakis 53 
griffiths said however that by the end of the 1990s or into 
the next century we will see both a black and a woman in the white 
house 
there will come a time when there will be a black candidate so 
experienced and competent that they will not be able to deny him

high school principal joe clark urged newspaper 
publishers to consider the plight of blacks shortly after a panel 
of experts urged the executives to offer more opportunities to 
minority journalists 
clark principal of the primarily black 3000student eastside 
high school in paterson nj who has been both lauded and 
criticized for strict discipline of his students said president 
reagan has denied opportunity to blacks during his administration 
but doing so has spurred them to improve their lives said 
clark who is black 
reagan has played a key role in the evolution of black 
folks clark told about 1500 people gathered here tuesday for 
the 102nd annual convention of the american newspaper publishers 
association 
what ronald reagan did was take the handout away from black 
people and make us work for ourselves he said adding that the 
result was massive voter registration by blacks 
the threeday convention which ends today has attracted 
attracted newspaper executives representing 90 percent of the daily 
newspaper circulation in the united states 
clark said the us welfare economy had made blacks unproductive 
weve lost a generation of black folks to drugs weve lost a 
generation to illegitimacy he said 
the way to reverse the decline is to provide role models to 
bring successful blacks back into the ghettos to provide 
inspiration he said 
where are the dwight goodens of science where are the michael 
jordans of mathematics clark asked theyre out there he 
said but must return regularly to the inner city to encourage 
those left behind 
clark had a more physical solution for fighting crime 
i think a few lynchings are in order he said adding that 
the drug problem in the unites states was so severe that sometimes 
violence against drug dealers was the only answer 
such tough attitudes and his habit of carrying a baseball bat 
through the halls of eastside high have angered civil libertarians 
and others who say clark is all talk and little action he counters 
that he has the support of his students and their best interests in 
mind 
clarks emotional and loudly applauded speech contrasted sharply 
with an earlier orderly panel discussion on the status of minority 
workers 
but the message was often the same along with encouragement 
minorities need educational opportunities to help them compete in 
the work world 
panelist gerald adolph a principal with the new york management 
consulting firm booz allen amp hamilton inc said minorities and 
women should be judged on their individual merits not considered 
universal representatives of their race sex or culture 
judge people on their own merits and give them a chance to 
succeed as individuals he said 
adolph who is black advised minority applicants not to try to 
fit into a white mold but to emphasize our diversity try to 
find companies that value our diversity 
david lawrence jr the publisher and chairman of the detroit 
free press moderated the discussion which also included roy 
roberts general motors corp vice president for personnel 
administration and development barbara f cox executive director 
for human resources at us west business resources inc of 
englewood colo and daisy chinlor an area director of human 
resources for avon products inc 
lawrence said newspapers staffed predominantly by white males 
risked ignoring the needs of many readers and becoming irrelevant 
to them 
he said a 1986 survey by the american society of newspaper 
editors found that nearly 60 percent of newspapers in the united 
states employ no minority journalists and that minorities accounted 
for less than 7 percent of newsroom professional staffs nationwide 
its hard for a newsroom full of white male editors to fake 
the insight you need to relate to a diverse community of readers 
he said 
roberts said the economic survival of businesses including 
newspapers depended on staff diversity 
companies that fail to consider minorities in their marketing 
strategies will be the companies that lose the competitive 
race he said

the only socialist government in 
canada the new democratic party administration in manitoba 
province was resoundingly defeated in a provincial election 
but tuesdays vote failed to produce a clear winner 
with most results tabulated the canadian broadcasting corp 
forecast the progressive conservative party would win 25 of the 57 
seats in the provincial legislature the liberal party was set to 
take 20 seats while the new democrats slumped to third place with 
just 12 seats 
the outcome left conservative leader gary filmon 45 in 
position to lead a minority government but he could be forced 
right back into an election campaign unless he can convince the 
liberals or new democrats to support him on crucial votes 
outgoing new democrat premier howard pawley was forced to call 
an early election when his government lost a vote of confidence 
last month 
pawley chose not to run for reelection and his successor as 
party leader gary doer failed to win much support pawley ran 
into trouble after approving a 24percent increase in rates under 
the provinces governmentrun auto insurance plan 
the biggest surprise tuesday was the 22 percent gain in support 
for the liberal party led by sharon carstairs 
the result has national implications federal prime minister 
brian mulroney a progressive conservative has to call a national 
election within the next year and looked to manitoba for a 
convincing conservative win 
filmon backs mulroneys two major initiatives the free trade 
agreement with the united states and the meech lake constitutional 
accord bringing quebec into the 1982 constitution as a distinct 
society of frenchspeakers 
however carstairs and the liberals oppose both initiatives and 
could prevent a minority conservative government from implementing 
their provisions 
the new democrats who have governed manitoba for 15 of the past 
19 years also oppose the free trade agreement and the meech lake 
accord

president joachim chissano blamed 
south africa for mozambiques devastating civil war but sent an 
emissary on a goodwill mission to the whiteruled nation raising 
the possibility of a summit meeting 
chissano spoke harshly of south africa at the opening of a 
conference convened tuesday by his marxistoriented government and 
the united nations to address mozambiques emergency relief needs 
for the coming year 
mozambique says 6 million of its 145 million people need 
emergency food aid it has appealed for 900 million tons of donated 
food as well as other assistance with a total cost of 380 
million 
mozambique attributes most of its problems to the insurgency 
waged since 1977 by the mozambique national resistance which it 
says is backed by south africa in violation of a 1984 
nonaggression treaty 
but as the conference began chissano dispatched cooperation 
minister jacinto veloso with a conciliatory message for south 
african president pw botha south africas foreign ministry said 
veloso met with botha conveyed chissanos interest in improving 
relations and discussed a possible summit meeting between the two 
leaders 
the foriegn ministry quoted botha as offering to promote 
regional development and saying the two countries should stop 
accusing each other of breaching the 1984 nonaggression accord 
in the treaty mozambique and south africa pledged to halt 
assistance to insurgents fighting the other countrys government 
there is widespread international support for mozambiques claim 
that south african security forces continue to provide logistical 
aid to the mozambican rebels despite the treaty 
the conference in maputo was attended by about 200 delegates 
from un agencies relief organizations and foreign governments 
a us delegate deputy assistant secretary of state roy stacey 
accused the mozambican rebels of one of the most brutal 
holocausts against ordinary human beings since world war ii 
stacey said the rebels supporters wherever they may be 
cannot wash the blood from their hands unless all support for this 
unconscionable violence is stopped immediately without 
specifying figures he said the united states intended to make 
mozambique its largest aid recipient in subsaharan africa 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar in a message to 
the conference said mozambique remains the target of externally 
supported acts of destabilization 
this continued reign of terror has increasingly involved 
random and brutal killings pillaging of the population widescale 
destruction and sabotage he said 
in his speech chissano said south africa was engaged in a 
criminal and irresponsible strategy to weaken blackruled 
southern african states 
he said the rebel movement has its command in south africa 
where it receives all kinds of aid 
a swedish official sten rylander urged the international 
community to provide security assistance as well as emergency aid 
in order to protect relief projects 
despite the strains between mozambique and south africa there 
have been signs of increasing cooperation 
the two governments have engaged in negotiations aimed at 
rehabilitating a major hydroelectric project in mozambique that has 
been frequently targeted by rebel saboteurs 
on monday the chairman of south africas largest conglomerate 
held talks with chissano and other mozambican officials in maputo 
on the possible involvement of anglo american corp in developing 
mozambiques natural resources anglos chairman gavin relly said 
his company might be interested in forestry agriculture and 
natural gas projects

convention with a look at issues facing the asiapacific region 
scheduled speakers today are gennady gerasimov the chief of the 
information department of the soviet unions ministry of foreign 
affairs admiral ronald j hays commander in chief of the united 
states pacific command and fredrick f chien a representative of 
the coordination council for north american affairs in taipei 
taiwan juan bautista sosa panamas ambassador to the united 
states is also scheduled to speak 
on tuesday the publishers were urged to hire more minorities 
controversial new jersey high school principal joseph clark 
delivered an emotional speech on the plight of blacks in america 
and nbc news senior commentator john chancellor said jesse jackson 
was not up to the demands of the vice presidency and did not want 
the job anyway 
hes the least vice presidential type of person you ever met 
in your life i mean you have to work chancellor said after his 
luncheon speech 
jackson has said he is a tree shaker not a jelly maker 
chancellor said vice presidents dont even get to make much jelly 
and they never get to shake the tree 
chancellor said jackson would be wise not to accept the vice 
presidential spot because if the democrats lose he would be 
blamed the 46yearold jackson is young enough to seek the top 
spot in 1996 chancellor said 
assuming jackson does not get the democratic presidential 
nomination chancellor said america will be left with two 
uncharismatic candidates republican vice president george bush and 
democrat michael dukakis 
it looks as though well have a grilled cheese sandwich 
running against a chocolate milk shake this fall he said 
chancellor told the newspaper executives president reagans 
administration will end in about nine months in an orgy of 
sentimentality a great gushy farewell to the gipper 
clark black principal of eastside high school in paterson 
nj who has been criticized and lauded for his strict 
disciplinary tactics said reagan has denied opportunity to blacks 
during his administration but by doing so has spurred them to 
improve their lives 
reagan has played a key role in the evolution of black 
folks clark said because his record on civil rights and 
domestic programs caused a massive voter registration by blacks 
clarks emotional and heartily applauded speech followed a panel 
discussion on the status of minority workers 
panelist gerald adolph a principal with the new york management 
consulting firm booz allen amp hamilton inc said minorities and 
women should be judged on their individual merits not considered 
universal representatives of their race sex or culture 
judge people on their own merits and give them a chance to 
succeed as individuals he said 
adolph who is black advised minority applicants not to try to 
fit into a white mold but to emphasize our diversity try to 
find companies that value our diversity 
david lawrence jr publisher and chairman of the detroit free 
press who moderated the discussion said newspapers staffed 
predominantly by white males risked ignoring the needs of many 
readers and becoming irrelevant to them 
its hard for a newsroom full of white male editors to fake 
the insight you need to relate to a diverse community of readers 
he said 
earlier tuesday susan and martin tolchin authors of buying 
into america how foreign money is changing the face of our 
nation said foreigners were buying property and businesses all 
over the country without the federal government investigating the 
longterm effects 
foreign investment is happening to us quicker than we can 
absorb it ms tolchin said

ohio state university is giving its 
business students 5 million to invest in a test of whether 
students can outperform the standard amp poors index and the 
universitys regular money managers 
the students will never have their hands on the money or stock 
certificates but they will make the decisions said university 
treasurer james nichols 
the performance of the students would be judged against the 
performance of the market and that of professional investment 
managers nichols said 
if over time the students dont do well against the market 
and the professionals the program will be terminated he said 
he said he knew of no other university using such an amount of 
money in similar programs he said other universities involve about 
50000 in their programs 
under the program announced this week students would act as 
investment managers as part of an advanced investments course for 
undergraduates they will be expected to follow the same procedures 
as professional investment managers 
the money would come from the universitys endowment which is 
about 245 million the fund consists of donations and doesnt 
include money from state subsidies or student tuition 
investments probably would be made on the new york stock 
exchange and the american stock exchange and be consistent with 
the universitys conservative investment policies nichols said 
we are always looking a appreciation on longterm 
investments he said we try to steady and over time that has 
paid off 
the course probably will be offered during the fall and winter 
quarters the next school year it is scheduled for a trial run this 
summer 
stephen buser a professor of finance said the investments 
would add a new dimension to education this program will give 
students a view of the real world from the classroom he said 
the program was suggested by osu trustee john j barone a 
toledo lawyer

a woman accused of killing her husband and a 
woman by putting cyanide in excedrin capsules had discussed copying 
the chicagoarea tylenol poisonings that killed seven the 
defendants daughter testified 
stella nickell also failed in an attempt to kill her husband 
bruce by putting black seeds she believed were toxic into capsules 
and giving them to him with his morning vitamins her daughter 
cindy hamilton said tuesday 
hit men were dismissed as too expensive and putting cocaine in 
his iced tea also was abandoned as a possible murder ploy ms 
hamilton told a us district court jury 
prosecutors have portrayed mrs nickell as an unhappy wife in a 
marriage beset by financial problems who plotted her husbands 
death to gain his insurance benefits and needed a second random 
death to divert suspicion 
mrs nickell suggested the 1982 tylenol episode in which 
victims died from capsules laced with cyanide would be very easy 
to reenact safer and less expensive than other means of killing 
nickell ms hamilton said 
in her mrs nickells own words it would have been easy 
because they were looking for people shoplifting and taking things 
from the store not for putting something back ms hamilton 
said 
with tears streaming down her face ms hamilton said she didnt 
warn nickell her stepfather because she didnt think he would 
believe her 
i had nothing i could take to him and present him with the 
truth she said how do you make your stepfather who has only 
been close to you real close to you for four years believe that 
his wife of almost 12 years who is supposed to love him is going 
to kill him how do you approach somebody with that 
prosecutors contend mrs nickell not only killed her husband but 
placed several cyanidelaced excedrin bottles on shelves of drug 
stores near her home they say susan katherine snow 40 of 
suburban auburn died from ingesting capsules from one of those 
bottles 
tuesdays testimony came in the seventh day of the nations 
first trial of anyone charged with causing death by tampering with 
overthecounter medicine the chicago case has not been solved 
mrs nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product 
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in 
extrastrength excedrin and anacin3 bottles that were recovered in 
stores in auburn and nearby kent 
prosecutors say mrs nickells plan began to unravel when ms 
hamilton challenged her attempt to make the june 1986 deaths of 
nickell 52 and ms snow appear to be random murders 
in other testimony tuesday roger m martz an fbi chemist said 
he found cyanide in capsules in an excedrin bottle from the snow 
residence two excedrin bottles from the nickell home one bottle 
at a kent supermarket and in an anacin3 bottle from an auburn drug 
store 
the average cyanide dosage in the capsules was 700 milligrams 
which is lethal martz said 
in each of the tampered capsules he also found green specks that 
were identified as algae destroyer a product used to eliminate 
algae in fish tanks martz testified 
in testimony last week a pet store employee said mrs nickell 
was a tropical fish enthusiast who bought the product 
there was no scientific reason for the algae destroyer to be 
mixed with the cyanide martz said 
carl e collins an fbi fingerprint specialist testified that 
he found mrs nickells fingerprints on three library encyclopedias 
with references to cyanide and on a library book about poisons

the us dollar rose in quiet european trading 
this morning after strengthening earlier in asia foreign currency 
dealers said gold prices also rose 
dealers said the dollar received some psychological support from 
its rise against the japanese yen which lost ground on signs the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries and seven nonopec 
producers meeting in vienna may be able to agree to substantive 
production cuts 
the yen is particularly sensitive to oilprice developments 
because of japans heavy dependence on oil imports 
dealers said the dollar was also buoyed by continued market 
uneasiness about developments in the middle east particularly 
saudi arabias announcement tuesday night that it was severing ties 
with iran and giving iranian diplomats one week to leave the 
country 
the market often views the dollar as a safe haven currency 
in times of political tensions 
in tokyo the dollar rose 042 yen to a closing 12499 after 
breaking through the psychologically important 125 yen level during 
trading later in london it was quoted higher at 12520 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late tuesday 
16785 west german marks up from 16747 
13895 swiss francs up from 13860 
56991 french francs up from 56875 
18798 dutch guilders up from 18765 
124630 italian lire up from 124400 
12285 canadian dollar down from 12289 
in london the british pound was quoted at 18730 cheaper for 
buyers than 18760 late tuesday 
gold firmed in moderate trading in london on news of the opec 
meeting higher oil prices are seen as inflationary and often 
result in higher gold prices since gold is seen as a hedge against 
inflation 
at midmorning londons five major bullion dealers fixed a 
recommended price of 44910 a troy ounce little changed from the 
opening bid but up from late tuesdays 44750 
in zurich the bid price was 449 up from 448 late tuesday 
earlier in hong kong gold rose 103 to close at a bid 45097 
silver was quoted in london today at a bid price of 637 a troy 
ounce compared with tuesdays 636

a senior united nations official 
predicted washington would ignore a world court ruling that said 
the united states violated a un treaty by trying to close the 
plos new york office 
in an advisory opinion issued tuesday the international court 
of justice as the court is formally known ordered the united 
states to submit to arbitration in its dispute with the united 
nations over the palestine liberation organizations observer 
mission to the united nations 
the court is the judicial arm of the united nations it has no 
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its 
rulings 
the reagan administrations dispute with the un arose from 
legislation signed into law by the us congress in december that 
classifies the plo as a terrorist organization and bars it from 
operating on american soil 
the us government maintains that the antiterrorist law takes 
precedence over any international agreements 
carlaugust fleischhauer of west germany the un 
undersecretarygeneral for legal affairs told reporters after 
tuesdays ruling that he doubted the united states would submit to 
arbitration 
we want harmonious relations with our host country 
fleischhauer said we are ready to go to arbitration it is now 
basically for the united states government to decide what 
conclusions it draws from this ruling 
it is a pleasure to be proved right fleischhauers boss 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said of the ruling 
during a press conference in new york 
although the court took pains to dodge the question of whether 
washingtons attempt to close the plo office is legal the ruling 
was seen in vienna as an implicit condemnation of the us effort 
the court said the us justice departments shutdown order 
violated the headquarters agreement by not submitting the issue to 
arbitration first that 1947 pact between the truman administration 
and the un guarantees diplomats unimpeded access to un 
headquarters in new york 
the united states is bound to respect the obligation to have 
recourse to arbitration said the courts 15 judges 
the headquarters agreement mandates independent arbitration of 
any disputes arising from it but the united states has rejected 
any such arbitration 
the opinion marked the second time in two years the court has 
ruled against the united states in the previous case brought by 
nicaragua the united states boycotted the proceedings and ignored 
the courts order to halt its support for rebels trying to 
overthrow the managua government 
the plo was granted permanent observer status by the un 
general assembly in 1974 and its un mission has been operating 
ever since out of an office in manhattan its information office in 
washington dc was closed prior to the passage of the 
antiterrorist legislation 
early this year the us government said arbitration of the plo 
mission issue was premature and noted that the antiterrorist law 
would only come into force on march 22 
when the plo refused to comply with us attorney general edwin 
meese iiis march 22 order to close its new york operation the 
us government filed suit in a new york federal court that 
lawsuit is pending 
washingtons attempt to close the plo office has been condemned 
by every un member nation except israel

the nato defense ministers today opened 
a twoday session to review the longrange nuclear arms strategy of 
the western alliance 
the session involves an assessment of how nato must adjust its 
nuclear arms after a 1983 decision to remove 1400 nuclear warheads 
from europe and the signing in december of the superpower accord to 
scrap hundreds of intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
nato officials said us defense secretary frank c carlucci 
briefed his counterparts on preparations in the united states and 
the soviet union for an elaborate 13year inspection system to 
check compliance with the intermediate nuclear forces or inf 
treaty 
carlucci also gave an update on moscows efforts to modernize 
its nuclear arms sources reported 
carlucci arrived tuesday and met with us gen john galvin 
natos top military commander in europe and nato secretary general 
lord carrington in advance of the ministerial meeting 
it is the first session of defense ministers since the dec 8 
signing of the ussoviet accord to eliminate two classes of 
groundlaunched nuclear missiles 
the ministers meeting comes as hopes have dimmed that an 
eastwest treaty to cut strategic nuclear arms by 50 percent can be 
signed at the may 29june 2 meeting in moscow between president 
reagan and mikhail s gorbachev 
us secretary of state george p shultz said in brussels this 
week said it would be extremely difficult to get a treaty by 
the end of may 
but shultz said the reagan administration will keep negotiating 
beyond the moscow summit for a strategic arms reduction treaty that 
he said has broad bipartisan support in the united states 
the ministerial meeting was moved to the nato headquarters from 
denmark because of a political crisis there over nuclear arms 
policy 
the danish government was defeated april 14 on a parliamentary 
motion demanding visiting warships be told they cannot bring 
nuclear arms into danish ports nato officials have complained that 
the motion if implemented would undermine natos defense strategy 
for denmark 
us and british warships which would play a key role in 
defending denmark in times of crisis or war never say if they 
carry nuclear arms 
britain already has suspended royal navy visits to denmark 
because of the crisis which led the minority centerright 
government to call for early elections may 10 
the defense ministers will review their longterm nuclear arms 
planning in light of the goals nato has set for itself in recent 
years said allied officials 
nato has 4600 nuclear warheads in europe 2400 fewer that it 
had in 1983 it studies adjustments to its nuclear deterrent 
through arms modernization and redeployment without raising the 
number of warheads the studies deal with developing a new 
shortrange lance groundtoground missile a tactical 
airtoground missile and improved nuclear artillery shells 
the idea of modernizing shortrange nuclear arms most of which 
are based in west germany has stirred opposition there 
the west german government fears that as mediumrange missiles 
disappear under the inf treaty the improved shortrange arms will 
make west germany a more likely target for soviet attack 
west germany prefers shortrange nuclear arms talks in tandem 
with conventional arms talks scheduled to start in vienna this 
fall 
so do its allies but they notably the united states and 
britain say the shortrange arms still must be modernized by the 
mid1990s under a decision made in 1983 to meet the deadline the 
us congress must approve initial funds for the new weapons by 
1990

the united states is airlifting 
emergency arms supplies to afghan moslem guerrillas to replace 
weapons destroyed when a pakistani ammunition depot exploded this 
month a us official said today 
measures will be taken or have been taken to make sure that 
an arms shortage doesnt happen a major effort to airlift to 
compensate for the loss is under way the official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said the airlift was being 
done on an urgent emergency basis 
us and pakistani officials have been tightlipped about the 
contents of the depot that was destroyed in a gigantic explosion 
april 10 showering an estimated 40000 rockets grenades and 
artillery shells on the pakistani capital and the neighboring city 
of rawalpindi 
more than 100 people were killed and nearly 1300 were wounded 
according to official figures hundreds of people reportedly are 
still missing 
about 280 pakistani and three us military ordnance teams have 
worked almost nonstop to destroy unstable unexploded weapons at 
the depot 
the sound of the explosions set by the teams are still heard 
daily in the twin cities which have a combined population of 5 
million 
islamabad has promised to make public a report on the blast 
possibly within a week officials have hinted the blast may have 
been sabotage by afghan communist agents 
there has been speculation that a major portion of the ordnance 
was earmarked for the guerrillas fighting afghanistans communist 
government and the estimated 115000 soviet troops who back it up 
unconfirmed reports said the depot contained a huge stockpile of 
sophisticated weapons including us stinger antiaircraft 
missiles which washington had sent in anticipation of a peace 
accord that might include a cutoff of us aid to the guerrillas 
the united states soviet union pakistan and afghanistan signed 
an agreement on april 14 in geneva 
the agreement provided for a complete soviet troop withdrawal 
beginning may 15 to be completed within nine months it left out 
the question of continued us support of the guerrillas and soviet 
aid to the kabul government 
the us official said there were no plans to cut supplies to 
the guerrillas when the pullout begins he added that even if it 
appears moscow is stopping supplies to kabul it will take time to 
verify and reciprocate 
you cant close a pipeline on a daytoday basis the

a veterinarian with the state department of fish and game 
the female bear was killed with a lethal injection of

into residential areas where it stole chickens and a duck it even 
visited the home of mayor john doble and took a nap under a back 
yard deck

where it took refuge from a clapping crowd of police and citizens 
hunter said the bear was tranquilized monday evening near a 
public storage area and that an ear tag identified it as the bear 
captured in cloverdale 
the bear wandered into yards rummaged through garbage cans and

she never harmed anyone but at times she showed aggression 
toward humans hunter said if she had come across a little kid 
she might have caused some harm

rep charlie rose whose 7th district includes robeson county 
said he contacted rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house 
judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice after talking to 
constituents

of minority groups called for outside investigations 
one man has been charged with firstdegree murder in the

jimmy earl cummings an indian who was shot to death in november 
1986 by deputy sheriff kevin stone the son of sheriff hubert 
stone a coroners jury ruled cummings death as either self

hearings or turn the information over to the us justice 
department for possible indictments

a japanese cabinet ministers claim that his 
country was not the aggressor in world war ii is astonishing and 
very regrettable a chinese foreign ministry spokesman said today 
seisuke okuno japans national land agency director said in a 
speech friday that japan fought in the war to protect itself at a 
time when the white race had turned asia into a colony 
the remarks drew stern reaction in china japan set up the 
puppet state of manchukuo in northeast china and waged war against 
chinese communist and nationalist troops from 1937 to 1945 
its astonishing and very regrettable to us that a minister of 
japan made such discourteous remarks in this regard of historical 
facts chinese foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said at a 
weekly news briefing 
his remarks will not only hurt the feelings of the chinese 
people and the people of other asian countries that were subjected 
to aggression but will also impair japans image in the world li 
said 
japanese foreign minister sosuke uno who is to visit china at 
the end of the week said tuesday in tokyo that okunos remarks 
were regrettable and that friendship with china is very important 
okuno spoke after he visited the controversial yasukuni shinto 
shrine in tokyo during spring memorial services 
china and other asian countries objected when former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone and other japanese leaders visited the 
shrine which honors japans war dead including convicted war 
criminals 
in his speech okuno said that china should not try to stop 
japanese leaders from attending the memorial services and said 
it is a crying shame that chinese leader deng xiaopings remarks 
shake and disturb all of japan with such repercussions 
last week deng told masayoshi ito a special envoy for prime 
minister noboru takeshita of japan that he was alarmed by 
rightwing militarists in japan 
taking them on an individual basis such things are not so 
big but when grouped together they then represent a kind of 
tendency and a kind of force which could easily sabotage 
sinojapanese friendship the official xinhua news agency on 
tuesday paraphrased deng as telling ito who was in beijing to 
prepare for takeshitas visit to china in august

the copilot of a commuter plane that crashed 
near durango in january claiming nine lives was not under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident 
authorities say 
blood and urine samples taken from the body of ralph d harvey 
42 turned up nothing out of the ordinary alan pollock of the 
national transportation safety board said tuesday 
an earlier toxicology report showed traces of cocaine in the 
body of stephen e silver pilot of continental express flight 2286 
that crashed in a snowstorm on jan 19 
federal authorities had earlier reported that harvey suffered 
bouts with alcoholism in the 1970s and early 1980s and had failed 
to report a 1977 drunkendriving conviction and a 1972 
publicintoxication conviction 
family and friends said the results were proof that harvey had 
overcome his alcoholism and had abstained from drinking during the 
three years before his death 
im glad that everyone will know that his toxicology was clean 
and that he was an upstanding citizen who did care and help a lot 
of people said rusty eccher a friend of harvey 
the ntsb also announced tuesday it would not have a public 
hearing into the durango crash 
an investigator may feel that a hearing wont reveal any new 
information pollock said 
he did not know when authorities would issue their report on the 
durango crash such investigations usually take about one year he 
added

michael dukakis on track to the democratic 
nomination after a terrific win in the pennsylvania primary 
today responded to george bushs criticism that he lacks foreign 
policy experience saying its not how much time you spent living 
in washington that matters 
i dont know what good experience is when you sit there next 
to the president and do nothing while we trade arms to the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for hostages when you go to the 
phillipines and commend former president ferdinand marcos for 
his commitment to democracy while you continue to support a failed 
and illegal policy in central america dukakis said on cbstv 
bush who captured enough delegates in the pennsylvania primary 
to clinch the republican nomination recently has focused his 
attacks on dukakis the likely democratic nominee after big wins in 
wisconsin new york and pennsylvania 
the vice president has charged that the massachusetts governor 
lacks the experience in foreign policy to run the nation 
dukakis said its not how much time you spent living in 
washington that makes the difference its your values its the 
quality of the people you pick your ability to work with the 
congress and the american people to shape a foreign policy that 
reflects our foreign policy and principles 
dukakis said if he won the nomination he would debate bush on 
those issues bush said today he would ask dukakis what the 
democrat would do about the hostages and about keeping persian gulf 
sea lanes open 
on tuesday night dukakis refused to claim the nomination 
although he scored a better than 21 win over rival jesse jackson 
and widened his delegate lead 
im in every single primary and im going to be campaigning in 
every single primary he said 
i want to say thank you to the people of pennsylvania for a 
terrific victory he told reporters 
the massachusetts governor would not say he has clinched the 
nomination 
remember i am someone people are just getting to know he 
said 
but with the major victory dukakis faced a new barrage of 
questions about his choice for the vice presidential spot dukakis 
repeated his claim of not worrying about that until the primaries 
end june 7 
however he talked about potential running mates saying he 
would consider jackson as well as sen sam nunn of georgia 
nunn the chairman of the senate armed services committee has 
been frequently mentioned as a possible no 2 dukakis said thats 
possible 
he is certainly somebody who ought to be considered by the 
nominee dukakis said 
he repeated his stance that jackson should be considered as a 
possible vice presidential choice sure i wouldnt rule him 
out 
cbs news said it talked to democratic party officials in 46 
states for their choice for the second spot on the ticket a total 
of 22 named nunn and five name sen albert gore jr 
asked if he would give a vice president a cabinet post as some 
have suggested for nunn dukakis did not answer directly 
i am someone who has always involved my lieutenant governor 
actively in my administration and given that person real 
responsibility and i would expect to do the same as 
president dukakis said 
the first and most important criterion is that that person can 
be a firstrate president if something happens to the president 
pick that kind of person and i have no doubt there will be very 
important responsibilities he said 
asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his dukakis 
refused to claim the crown yet referring to democratic nominee 
walter mondales problems in 1984 
i reminded many of you that fritz mondale won new york and 
pennsylvania and then lost a whole string of primaries he 
explained 
ill be campaigning just as hard and just a vigorously in 
the primaries to come he said were going to work very hard to 
win every one of them

voters stunned the governing party in 
a national election by stripping it of a parliamentary majority for 
the first time in south koreas 40year history 
president roh taewoo who took office in february said the big 
gains by opposition candidates in tuesdays national assembly races 
would make it difficult for him to govern 
stock prices plunged to record lows after the upset after 
election results were announced the composite stock price index 
fell 2458 points to 6201 the previous record drop was 2169 on 
feb 26 
final returns released today showed that 164 candidates from 
three main opposition parties were assured of seats in the 
299member national assembly rohs party won 125 seats 
independents captured nine and one race still was undecided 
earlier returns based in part on projections had 166 opposition 
seats and and 123 governing party seats 
the previous national assembly had 276 seats 160 held by the 
governing party and 87 by the three main opposition parties 
the election was the first test of public confidence in the roh 
government which in december narrowly won the countrys first 
direct presidential elections in 16 years 
balloting was marred by violent demonstrations that left at 
least two people dead protesters backing opposition candidates 
marched in the streets battled riot police and accused roh forces 
of vote tampering scores of protesters were detained 
roh said the election has left many things for us to think 
deeply about but i would humbly accept the outcome and do my best 
to fulfill my promise to the people 
roh won the presidency with just 36 percent of the vote when the 
two main opposition leaders kim daejung and kim youngsam ran 
separately and split the antigovernment vote in december 
both kims won seats in the national assembly on tuesday 
kim daejungs party for peace and democracy emerged as the 
strongest opposition force with 70 seats he said lawmakers should 
consider releasing all political prisoners and demand a probe into 
the bloody suppression of the 1980 kwangju protest in which 200 
people died 
officials of the governing party said it was considering ways to 
absorb or align with some independent members or moderate 
opposition members 
rough sailing is expected in the national assembly with the 
emergence of a strong opposition said park sungbum of the kbs 
state television network 
under the nations new constitution the assembly has an 
expanded role in governing it is now empowered to investigate 
state affairs and the president can no longer dissolve it 
kim youngsams reunification democratic party won 59 seats the 
new democratic republican party a conservative group headed by 
former prime minister kim jongpil controls 35 seats 
kim daejung said the results showed that his party is best 
qualified to challenge rohs administration kim 62 was often 
imprisoned by past regimes for his political activity 
but he also promised to cooperate with roh if he delivers 
democratic reforms 
our party will not be a party always opposed to the government 
policy he said 
of the 299 assembly seats 224 were up for election from 
singlemember districts the other 75 were allotted according to 
the proportion of votes each party received assembly members serve 
fouryear terms 
officials estimated 726 percent of the 262 million registered 
voters cast ballots down from 892 percent in the december 
presidential election 
kim youngsam and kim jongpil were elected in the direct 
voting while kim daejung will take a seat in the assembly through 
the proportional allotment 
democratic justice party secretarygeneral shim myungbo 
expressed shock at the defeat voting trends based on localism 
really hurt us regional support is too onesided and took many 
seats away from us 
the new assemblys first priority is expected to be an 
opposition demand for an investigation of corruption under former 
president chun doohwan chuns younger brother kyunghwan was 
recently arrested and charged with embezzling millions of dollars 
as head of a semiofficial development agency

jim and tammy bakker say salary figures 
used by the irs to revoke the taxexempt status of ptl were 
exaggerated and in any case it is not up to the government to set 
salaries for ministers 
grossly inflated figures have been given for our personal 
income and then used by the ptl trustee to continue to discredit 
us bakker said in a news release sent from his home in palm 
springs calif 
the irs revoked ptls taxexempt status friday and said 
contributions to the financially troubled television ministry are 
no longer tax deductible an irs report in december concluded that 
the bakkers and their aides profited excessively from donations 
made to the ministry 
whether you agree on how much we should or should not have 
been paid never before in history has the federal government set 
the salary of a minister of the gospel bakker said just as 
never to my knowledge has the united states government appointed 
the head of a church ministry as it has now done at ptl 
the bakkers apparently were referring to david clark the 
courtappointed bankruptcy trustee for ptl 
i could not believe when i heard the trustee say on a recent 
ptl telecast that my income alone for 1987 was 2977018 when in 
fact tammy and i together took home 200554 from ptl that year 
in the last three years he said we made over 8000000 when 
according to our accountant together we took home an average of 
531000 per year for those three years 1985 1986 and 1987 
bakker said 
bakker also disputed the internal revenue services conclusion 
that much of ptls heritage usa theme park operations were 
commercial rather than ministerial 
the bakkers also repeated that they wanted to return to save the 
ministry they founded they left the ministry following revelations 
of a sexual encounter between jim bakker and a former church 
secretary 
on april 15 when ptl officials told him they couldnt raise the 
57 million needed by may 7 to comply with the bankruptcy 
reorganization plan judge rufus reynolds said it looks like the 
end of the road for the ministry 
its definitely a liquidation said reynolds the federal 
bankruptcy judge who is handling the case its just a matter of 
how orderly a liquidation

when robert ellsworth dusted off his rolodex 
and started work on the bob dole campaign he didnt waste much 
time worrying that george bush was invincible far from it 
ellsworth is a longtime friend and adviser to dole and like 
many other republican activists he thought the senate gop leader 
could surprise the vice president and win the republican nomination 
as republican party chairman frank fahrenkopf said this week 
many thought at the outset of the presidential campaign that 
georges support was a mile wide and a quarterinch deep 
today dole has long since dropped out of the race leaving 
former tv evangelist pat robertson to offer token resistance in a 
few caucus states 
today the nomination belongs to bush his victory in tuesday 
nights pennsylvania primary gave him the delegates to clinch it 
ellsworth says bush had hidden strength in his race for the 
white house 
bush had been working in the field of republican politics for 
all his adult life and the field of reagan politics for eight 
years he put together a smart sophisticated and wellfinanced 
campaign organization that steered him through some rough 
midwestern waters 
republican consultant john deardourff said bush had built such a 
foundation of support before the 1988 gop race that it was 
impossible for anyone to chip away at it 
when these other people began to go around and look for 
help he said they had to build from scratch dole in 
particular the word was that doles people were having trouble 
just making contacts with the republican party establishment in 
the states 
i had people calling me all the time from all over the 
country ellsworth recalls these people knew me well and 
said look your man dole is a good man but we like bush 
former white house political director mitchell daniels said bush 
won the gop contest by capitalizing on natural advantages 
accumulated over a number of years he did it with the crucial help 
of gov john sununu in new hampshire 
in fact governors played an instrumental role in bushs 
success carroll campbell of south carolina and jim thompson of 
illinois provided crucial personal support and put their campaign 
organizations to work for the vice president 
daniels said there has been much talk of bushs southern base as 
the firewall protecting the vice president against early 
campaign setbacks 
the real fire break was in new hampshire he said 
said gop consultant eddie mahe jr the single biggest factor 
had to be that his campaign team was capable and was allowed by him 
to do longrange comprehensive planning and to then execute the 
plans 
to hear the republican establishment talk about it now there 
was little serious doubt about bushs prospects despite his 
thirdplace finish in iowa and an unfocused stump speech that 
hampered the early going 
i think a lot of people misjudged george bushs strength 
said fahrenkopf some in the party said at the outset that 
georges support was a mile wide and a quarterinch deep it turned 
out that his support was a mile deep 
bushs main challenge was to cash in on a quartercenturys 
worth of good will as a party organizer and onetime chairman and 
avoid any critical mistakes gop officials and consultants said 
they added that remaining loyal to reagan helped bush among most of 
the republican primary voters 
because bush mostly stuck to the script his rivals dole 
robertson jack kemp pete du pont and alexander haig were 
virtually doomed from the start republican observers say now 
bush finished behind both dole and robertson in iowa a dismal 
showing that shook the candidate and his campaign organization the 
vice president would subsequently write off the iowa performance as 
a testimonial to dissatisfaction in the farm belt with reagan 
if he would lose iowa on the reagan coattails the polls said he 
won in new hampshire the same way but he didnt wait for the 
granite state to fall in his lap when he got there bush sat down 
with his advisers and came out with a new campaign look 
he had a week to recapture the momentum from dole 
when he came into the state he had to do well and when the 
vice president got here he did what he should have done in 
iowa said elsie vartanian head of the new hampshire republican 
party he rolled up his sleeves and went out and campaigned among 
the voters 
bush continued the mixandmingle campaign style posing with 
voters at their places of work and in a host of settings well 
after winning new hampshire 
he altered his strategy in new hampshire to directly attack dole 
in television advertisements accusing him of supporting tax 
increases 
mahe the gop consultant said that bush delegated authority to 
his campaign aides and that dole did not he said that bush seemed 
gracious in defeat while dole came off as mean and vindictive 
by accusing the vice president of lying about my record 
the outburst came during a live tv interview that reminded super 
tuesday voters that dole sometimes comes across as mean or angry 
bush returned to his basic stump speech for the super tuesday 
campaign in the southern and border states that pitch emphasized 
bushs support for a strong defense bringing the federal deficit 
under control spreading the cause of democracy around the world 
and giving new emphasis to education and the environment 
once hed disposed of dole and robertson in south carolina bush 
capped the republican race with a 16state primary sweep on super 
tuesday that marked the collapse of bushs republican opposition

a woman has been sentenced to 30 days in 
jail after pleading guilty to unlawful imprisonment of her 
8yearold stepgrandson who was kept in a box for two years 
retha skyles 54 had said she felt she had done nothing wrong 
but pleaded guilty in pierce county superior court because she 
could see there was enough evidence to convict her she was 
sentenced tuesday 
the maximum sentence would have been 90 days in jail two years 
probation and paying for indefinite counseling for the boy deputy 
prosecutor barbara coreyboulet said 
ms coreyboulet recommended the sentence of 30 days in the 
county jail and one year probation that judge thomas swayze jr 
imposed 
letters from fourth grade students were read aloud in court 
tuesday in which the children said swayze should impose a sentence 
equal to the time the child the son of ms skyles stepdaughter 
was confined 
but swayze said that although he understood that reaction was 
typical of public sentiment in the case he would stay within the 
sentencing guidelines he said the woman did not pose a criminal 
threat and 30 days would be more than enough 
in a handwritten statement ms skyles said i restrained him 
the boy during my sleeping hours in order to keep him from 
destroying property my judgment may not have been proper but my 
judgment as to the amount of restraint seemed proper to me under 
the circumstances 
she was charged with keeping the boy in a playhousesized box 
from may 1 1985 to may 1 1987 allowing him out only to defecate 
or attend church the box often was locked and contained a jar in 
which the boy was expected to urinate the charges said the boy 
was not allowed to attend school 
an anonymous referral tipped off state child protective services 
workers on april 29 1987 and they took the boy and his 
11yearold sister into custody 
when the boy was removed from the home he had a severe case of 
head lice and said he was surprised to learn that all little boys 
werent kept in boxes a court affidavit said 
the children are living with foster parents state officials 
said 
one of ms skyles adult sons has said the confinement was a 
temporary way to handle the tantrumprone boy he said the family 
believed the child was braindamaged because his mother had abused 
drugs and wouldnt properly care for him 
the natural mother who lives in california denied she was a 
drug abuser state officials have said there were no plans to 
return the children to their mother

here then threatened to kill his hostages beginning with the 
ones he did not know they said he told them to barricade the doors 
with desks and cabinets and to put their keys and wallets in a 
trash can and demanded cigarettes and soft drinks 
at first they thought he was joking said classmate jason burke 
17 
hes a jokingtype person and we didnt know if he was serious 
or not at first he said 
but that changed when the shot was fired then i was scared 
like everyone else burke said 
at one point school officials called the classroom to say they 
would be late in delivering the soft drinks and cigarettes cox 
allegedly told them a 7eleven store was 10 minutes away adding he 
planned to start shooting students in 9 minutes and 40 seconds if 
the delivery was late 
but burke said cox told the students i dont have any 
intention of killing anyone i dont think i can do it 
the crisis was not revealed to the schools 3200 other students

the chauffeur arrived on schedule in the ninth 
inning ready to take disc jockey bob rivers home and in the 186th 
hour of his vigil waiting for a baltimore orioles victory the 
limousine left empty again 
ok rivers sighed drawing it out as fred lynn popped up 
tuesday night to end the 42 loss to minnesota its business as 
usual which means at least 24 more hours at the wiyy 98 rock 
microphones for him waiting for a win 
rivers will pass the 200hour mark today day nine he is 08 in 
his wait that is not as bad as the orioles burdened by an 019 
record one loss short of the american league mark four away from 
the modern major league record and seven away from the alltime 
record 
the only records that interest rivers are the ones he spins he 
is not in the marathon broadcasting business 
i thought this would go one or two days he said i 
wondered if we should even bother with it because i thought it 
would be over so quickly do you know i havent driven in a week i 
havent been out of this building in a week 
he catches catnaps during taped music shows but the sleep is 
limited he looks a little worn and yawns frequently but seems to 
have kept his sense of humor 
i stuck my neck out he said and here i am 
this exercise in endurance began casually after the 11th 
straight oriole defeat rivers and another wiyy dj were at the game 
a 10 extrainning loss to cleveland that ended with the bases 
loaded for baltimore when the idea was hatched 
once it began stretching beyond a day or two rivers became 
something of a cult hero his dentist offered to bring his 
equipment to the studio a nurse visits daily to take rivers blood 
pressure hes had massages from chiropractors and calls of support 
from among others baltimores mayor marylands governor and 
orioles general manager roland hemond who confided that he wasnt 
sleeping either 
the element of chance makes it scary rivers said i dont 
know when i can leave 
for a while it seemed like rivers would escape tuesday night 
the orioles led 20 going into the bottom of the sixth and rivers 
admited being cautiously optimistic 
wiyy was playing hopeful selections like tonights the 
night by genesis but when kent hrbek and randy bush hit home 
runs for minnesota to put the twins ahead 32 rivers went to 
aint too proud to beg by the rolling stones 
were in serious trouble he said grimly 
and when hrbeks second homer of the game made it 42 he said 
it looks like we may have to hang out one more night 
at least 
the cramped studio from which he works is festooned with orange 
and black balloons pennants and pictures of happier oriole times 
the stations staff wears free bob rivers tshirts in oriole 
orange and black of course 
rivers is waiting this thing out in a wiyy 98 rock shirt that 
happens to be black he swears it is not because he is mourning 
over the woes of the os 
we will stay here until the orioles win rivers said 
resolutely 
each night his family visits the studio when lynn hit a 
leadoff home run tuesday night fueling the early hopes rivers 
missed it he was busy reading a bedtime story to his two sons 
5yearold keith and andrew who is 3 
rivers does not buy the theory that this streak cant go on 
forever and that the longer the birds lose the more likely it is 
that they will win 
if you flip a coin 3000 times and it comes up heads every 
time he said the next time you flip the odds for a tails are 
still 5050 
that is not encouraging talk and at the moment the dj needs 
all the encouragement he can get 
rivers is scheduled to throw out the first pitch when the 
orioles return home monday if they keep losing however that will 
be a problem since he has pledged not to leave the studio without a 
win he has a solution though 
ill stand on the roof toss the ball to a van and they can 
drive it to memorial stadium he said

americans personal incomes propelled by 
profitsharing payments in the auto industry shot up 08 percent 
in march the biggest increase in three months while consumer 
spending posted a healthy advance as well the government said 
today 
the commerce department said consumer spending rose 07 percent 
after an even stronger 08 percent rise in february 
the spending and incomes report provided further evidence that 
the key consumer sector was continuing to power economic growth 
despite the fears that had been raised following the october stock 
market collapse 
in a report tuesday the government said consumer spending 
after adjusting for inflation climbed at an annual rate of 38 
percent from january through march providing most of the strength 
for overall economic growth of 23 percent during the first quarter 
todays report said the 08 percent increase in incomes in 
march which followed a revised 06 percent february gain was the 
biggest monthly improvement since a similar 08 percent rise in 
december 
however much of the strength came from profitsharing payments 
made to autoworkers during the month which supplied more than half 
of the 123 billion growth in the key wages category 
without the profitsharing bonuses and shifts in farm subsidy 
payments incomes would have risen 02 percent during march 
in all personal incomes rose 296 billion to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 392 trillion while personal consumption 
spending which includes virtually everything except interest 
payments on debt rose 218 billion to an annual rate of 319 
billion 
disposable or aftertax incomes were up as well climbing 06 
percent in march following a 08 percent february increase 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income dipped slightly last month to 45 percent compared to 47 
percent in february 
the spending advance came in the categories of nondurable goods 
and services durable goods items such as cars which are expected 
to last at least three years edged down 300 million during march 
after a huge 92 billion rise in february 
but purchases of nondurable goods were up 98 billion while 
purchases of services which include housing costs rose 122 
billion

the judge in the irancontra case told 
prosecutors today he would be forced to dismiss the charges against 
marine lt col oliver l north and three codefendants unless key 
classified documents are turned over to the defense 
there seems to be an absolute stultification of informal 
discovery of key documents in the case which if are not turned 
over will mean the case will have to be dismissed us district 
judge gerhard a gesell said 
the judge said he wanted both sides to work to break a very 
serious logjam caused by the refusal of government agencies to 
release classified documents to the defendants 
gesell said he was extremely disturbed by the implications 
of a motion filed tuesday by defendant albert hakim complaining 
that independent counsel lawrence e walsh was trying to limit his 
access to the most sensitive documents gathered by the 
investigation 
under the procedures proposed by walsh lawyers for hakim and 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord would have to obtain 
court permission before showing these documents to their clients 
the proposed restrictions would not apply to the other two 
defendants charged with conspiring to illegally divert usiran 
arms sale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
north who was fired as a national security council aide and 
former national security adviser john m poindexter were privy to 
the nations most closely guarded intelligence and military secrets 
before they left the white house in november 1986 
they presumably saw or generated much of the material being 
reviewed by an interagency task force before it is turned over to 
the defense 
but hakim an iranianborn us citizen never had access to 
classified government documents secord his former business 
partner no longer has the security clearances issued when he was a 
topranking pentagon official 
hakim and secord brokered the usiran arms sales through swiss 
comopanies that also were used to funnel money to the contras 
hakims attorney n richard janis claimed in court papers that 
the proposed procedures directly contravene gesells order 
granting all the defendants access to classified documents being 
compiled by walsh 
gesell ordered walsh to give the defense 300000 pages of 
classified documents to enable the lawyers to determine if the 
material would help their cases 
the interagency task force is reviewing the documents to 
determine what sensitive secrets they contain 
between 5 percent and 10 percent of those reviewed thus far 
contain information that walsh does not want to allow hakim and 
secord to see without court permission according to court papers 
walsh said these documents contain secrets that if released 
could compromise us intelligence sources sensitive us military 
plans and foreign policy initiatives their release might also 
jeopardize the lives of hostages being held in the middle east 
according to court papers 
janis said walshs attempt to withhold this information from 
hakim and secord violates gesells order 
the pronouncements of this court make it clear that the 
government must now give mr hakim access to the information in its 
possession or face dismissal of the indictment against mr hakim 
janis brief said 
at an april 12 hearing janis was assured by gesell that hakim 
would get access to the documents even though hakim never had 
security clearances he has no less a need than the other 
defendants to see the material janis told gesell 
under the classified information procedures act secret 
documents must be declassified before they can be introduced into 
evidence 
walsh cant force government agencies such as the cia or the 
national security agency to declassify documents he or the defense 
wants to use at trial 
if no acceptable substitute for a document can be found such as 
a summary of facts it would show the judge could be forced to 
dismiss the case 
the judge also signaled a shift in his plans to examine the 
problems caused by the immunized congressional testimony of north 
hakim and poindexter 
we are a long way from any resolution of the pretrial 
kastigar problems gesell said referring to the 1972 supreme 
court ruling that says prosecutors must obtain their evidence 
independently from the defendants immunized testimony 
north poindexter and hakim contend their fifth amendment rights 
against selfincrimination would be violated if they are forced to 
stand trial because they gave testimony to congress that inevitably 
aided walshs investigation 
under the kastigar decision walsh must show that his 
investigation did not rely on any of the immunized testimony or 
leads derived from it 
gesell said he wanted to resolve the issue before the trial 
begins saying i have no interest in undertaking a 
fourtosixweek trial for no purpose only to throw it out at the 
end

chicagos ohare international airport has 
regained the title of worlds busiest that it held for many years 
according to the federal aviation administration 
a drop in the number of flights at hartsfield in the first three 
months of the year was responsible officials said 
hartsfield had edged ohare in the rankings for the first time 
in 1987 when hartsfield handled an estimated 797037 flights to 
ohares 794921 according to figures kept by controllers at the 
atlanta airport 
with 192211 flights in january february and march hartsfield 
fell into the no 2 position behind chicago which logged 196589 
flights in the quarter according to the faa 
that represents a 3 percent decrease in overall traffic at 
hartsfield compared with the same period last year when the 
airport recorded 197657 flights according to the faa 
ohare also had the highest delay rate with 55 delays per 1000 
flights while hartsfield had far fewer delays during the first 
three months of 1988 compared with last year faa figures showed 
through march hartsfield international recorded 9393 flight 
delays of 15 minutes or more for a rate of 49 delays per 1000 
flights compared with a rate of 84 per 1000 last year according 
to figures reported by the atlanta constitution today 
much of the reduction apparently is due to eastern airlines 
cutting back on flights to atlanta although hartsfield officials 
pointed out that the first quarter of 1987 set records that would 
be hard to match 
weve had record growth for three years in a row but its not 
going to continue forever even with the decrease those are still 
healthy traffic figures maybe weve just hit a plateau said

george bush challenged michael dukakis to 
fire away at him on the irancontra affair today and dukakis 
did just that after impressive pennsylvania victories clinched the 
gop presidential nomination for bush and gave democrat dukakis 
another big boost 
jesse jackson a distant second to dukakis in tuesdays 
pennsylvania primary said today i keep struggling against the 
odds and ive always struggled against the odds and succeeded 
this campaign will remain alive and will go right down to the 
wire 
in television interviews the vice president and the 
massachusetts governor set a combative tone for the summer campaign 
dukakis said of bushs involvement in the iranian 
armsforhostages dealing he sat there and did nothing while we 
engaged in one of the worst and one of the most misguided 
adventures in the history of american foreign policy 
bush said he would ask dukakis in debate what he would do about 
hostages in the middle east do you really care when a man like 
buckley is being tortured to death he said he would ask a 
reference to william buckley the cia official who died after being 
taken hostage in lebanon 
let him fire away bush said of dukakis in an interview on 
cbstv 
bush prodding the democrats on another sensitive issue said on 
nbctv he might pick up substantial support from blacks if they 
decide jackson wasnt given a fair deal by his party 
if hes not treated fairly a lot of people are going to be 
openminded and if i campaign properly with the way i feel in my 
heart about openness and inclusion we might surprise people 
there bush said 
with the nomination in hand for bush president reagan free at 
last drop his neutrality was meeting with his vice president today 
i am sure the president will offer his congratulations and 
discuss how he can help in the campaign said white house house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
ohio indiana and the district of columbia were the next 
battlegrounds each holding primaries next tuesday 
hes coming in with a head of steam ohio democratic party 
chairman james ruvolo said of dukakis but he also cautioned 
against washington insiders trying to end the race before its 
over 
it certainly looks now as though governor dukakis will be the 
nominee said john livengood the indiana democratic party 
chairman 
jackson vowed to remain positive and continue running 
through the final primaries on june 7 
you cant finish the race until the race is over he said 
we need to win this race in november so i will remain positive 
solid as his lead appeared dukakis insisted his race against 
jackson was by no means over 
im going to campaign as hard as i can in the primaries 
between now and june 7 dukakis said im going to campaign in 
every single primary 
he repeated his assertion that he didnt want to think about a 
running mate until after the primary season although he indicated 
he would consider jackson or sen sam nunn of georgia 
network interviews with voters at polling places found signs of 
growing strength for the massachusetts governor for the first 
time more than half his supporters said they backed him strongly 
in a reverse of the results in earlier primaries dukakis outpolled 
jackson among voters who cited the poor and elderly as their chief 
concerns as well as among who cited strong leadership and ability 
to make a change 
were almost getting down to the main event declared bush 
who got 79 percent of the pennsylvania popularity vote and also won 
more than enough delegates to lock in the 1139 he needed for a gop 
convention majority 
with 99 percent in the democratic pennsylvania vote was 
dukakis 1002198 or 67 percent 
jackson 409774 or 28 percent 
on the republican side with 99 percent of the vote in it was 
bush 686803 79 percent 
dole 105735 12 percent 
robertson 79581 9 percent 
the gop delegate count was far slower than the popular vote by 
the associated press delegate count bush needed to win at least 58 
of the 78 delegates at stake to clinch the 1139 needed to 
nominate and he did early today 
dukakis won a separate landslide in the election of democratic 
delegates taking 163 to jacksons 14 one was uncommitted that 
brought dukakis national delegate total to 1264 compared to 852 
for jackson it takes 2081 to clinch nomination 
as they needled each other with an eye on the fall campaign 
bush said dukakis doesnt know much about foreign affairs and 
declared that will be a major issue in the fall 
the massachusetts governor ridiculed bush on taxes comparing 
the vice president to gilbert and sullivans captain of the hms 
pinafore who after saying im never never sick at sea 
finally concedes hardly ever 
when bush announced for president last year he said im never 
going to raise your taxes period but two days later in an 
interview on cable news network the vice president said he might 
raise taxes as a last resort 
dukakis position on a tax increase has been that weve got to 
find new revenue i dont any responsible candidate for the 
presidency can rule out new taxes i cant make that judgment at 
the present time

the us embassy evacuated four of its 
13 american staffers this week because of a threat following a 
usiran confrontation in the persian gulf a western source said 
today 
we are on the highest state of alert i have ever seen here 
an embassy staffer said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the remaining staffers moved out of their homes and into the 
embassy compound on monday one brought her siamese cat which 
wandered in and out of diplomats offices on the second floor 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
embassy received information that an attack might be planned on the 
embassy which sits across the street from the building housing 
khad the afghan special security police 
he declined to say whether such an attack might be carried out 
by iranians or by iranianbacked afghans 
us embassies in the middle east have periodically evacuated 
staffers since the 1979 islamic fundamentalist revolution in iran 
but the source said this threat was aimed specifically at the 
embassy in kabul 
on april 18 the us navy attacked iranian oil platforms and 
ships in the persian gulf in retaliation for the planting of mine 
that damaged an american missile frigate and injured 10 sailors 
the united states blamed iran for the mining 
the us embassy has had a skeleton staff since shortly after 
the soviet unions 1979 military intervention in afghanistan to 
prop up a communist regime the soviet union is scheduled to start 
withdrawing its estimated 115000 soldiers on may 15 
the united states and most western nations withdrew their 
ambassadors in 1980 to protest the soviet intervention since then 
the us embassy has been headed by a charge daffaires who is 
among the staffers remaining 
security outside the walls surrounding the embassy grounds is 
provided by afghan paramilitary forces armed with automatic rifles 
a small contingent of us marines standard for all american 
embassies is inside the embassy 
a nonamerican diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
said iran has provided political support to some of the afghan 
moslem guerrillas fighting president najibs sovietbacked regime 
but has offered little in the way of money or arms 
he said iran was so completely obsessed by its hatred of 
america that it preferred to see the soviet union retain influence 
in afghanistan they are so much afraid that american influence 
will come back in afghanistan he said

church membership was a major concern of both 
lay and clerical leaders of the united methodist church meeting 
here today in its quadrennial general conference 
joan nagle a lay leader from murrysville pa said today that 
laity must become more involved in the decisionmaking process she 
said that making a commitment as a disciple means not only agreeing 
to principles of christian faith but also taking action 
bishop jack m tuell of los angeles in an address to open the 
twoweek conference monday said the church has lost more than 10 
percent of its membership over the last 20 years due to 
disagreements over church theology 
the church the secondlargest protestant denomination in the 
united states is down to about 97 million members from nearly 11 
million in 1968 tuell said 
tuell told the 966 church delegates that membership in the 
united methodist church is falling because the denominations most 
notable trait is that everyone disagrees with everyone else 
tuell who is slated next year to become president of the 
churchs council of bishops said uncertainty over united methodist 
doctrine has been responsible for the decrease in membership 
there is no evangelistic appeal to join a group whose 
principal identifying mark is that everyone disagrees with everyone 
else tuell said the time has come to say the last rites over 
the notion that the defining characteristic of united methodist 
theology is pluralism 
tuell said he hoped that reports to be heard from three study 
commissions during the conference can help us in this task of 
selfdetermination 
he said the church has seen improvement in the areas of racism 
and sexism but that much remains to be done 
nagle a senior engineer for westinghouse electric corp was 
chosen from four finalists and more than 300 entrants in february 
by the national association of annual conference lay leaders to 
give the laity address 
discipleship may mean doing for love what we would never dream 
of doing for money nagle said discipleship means coming early 
and staying late this is upholding by our presence 
the delegates half laypeople and half clergy from america 
europe africa and the philippines will consider more than 2650 
petitions during the convention which runs through may 6 
among the delegates are 290 women including more than half the 
american lay delegates and 14 percent of the clergy delegates 
central issues during the conference are the issues of 
homosexuality in the church genderless names for god and changes 
in the churchs official hymnal 
the commission on the status and role of women is supporting a 
proposal that would have church publications substitute the words 
creator for father and our savior or redeemer for 
his only son 
other groups are seeking those changes plus a change from holy 
spirit to sustainer to move united methodism away from roman 
catholicism 
some church members see a move to tighten the reins on 
interpretation of the scriptures as a reaction to liberalism that 
cropped up in the 1960s

a tiny california condor chick that scientists 
say represents the salvation of its species pecked a hole in its 
eggshell today officials said 
keepers at san diego wild animal park are keeping a 
roundtheclock vigil over the egg the first produced by captive 
california condors under a program started 15 years ago to save the 
nearly extinct species spokesman tom hanscom said 
the chick should win its struggle to break out of the the 
bluegreen shell within the next three days he said it began 
using its lungs for the first time sunday when it pushed its beak 
into an air pocket at the eggs narrow end 
the chipping of a small hole in the shell or pipping begins a 
critical phase in the birds development hanscom said 
we have a remote tv camera on the egg monitoring it 
constantly hanscom said and every hour the egg is physically 
tapped by a keeper to provide the same outside stimulation one 
might expect from a natural mother in the nest 
if the chick fails to hatch itself by saturday morning keepers 
and veterinarians will step in and help it get out hansom said 
the chick will be handraised by keepers using a puppet resembling 
an adult condor for feeding 
the chick is especially susceptible to infection and exhaustion 
now that it has broken through the eggshell hanscom said 
the california condor north americas largest land bird with a 
wing span of up to 10 feet once ranged along the pacific coast 
from canada to mexico 
only 27 california condors are known to exist today all in 
captivity at the wild animal park and the los angeles zoo the last 
wild bird having been captured last year 
the fertile egg laid march 3 was the culmination of an 
elaborate courtship dance and mating of a young male designated ac4 
and his older mate un1 the egg was removed from the parks 
condorminium and placed in an incubator 
exhaustion from trying to break the shell could kill the chick 
but keepers must allow 72 hours to pass before intervening hanscom 
said if they step in too early they could cause the chick to 
bleed to death by rupturing a membrane of blood cells that the 
condor needs to absorb he said 
we dont want to be pessimistic but we are very anxious at 
this time hanscom said 
thirteen of 14 condor eggs taken from nests in the wild have 
hatched in captivity all with human assistance he said 
the chicks parents have continued to mate raising hopes for a 
second egg at the los angeles zoo two other potential mating 
pairs have failed to begin the courtship dance 
hanscom said the pairs may not have adjusted to captivity or may 
be incompatible 
these birds mate for life and here we are chosing mates 
artificially for them he said that might not always take the 
birds may not always decide to follow our magic making 
scientists sought to begin the condor capturebreeding program 
during the 1950s but were delayed by opposition by the national 
audubon society and others 
the opponents eventually were pacified by assurances that the 
condors natural habitat would be protected and that a wild 
population eventually would be reestablished 
federal and state agencies have joined the multimilliondollar 
effort to regenerate the birds 
the success of the program wont be known for years as the 
oldest bird hatched in captivity is 5 years old and condors reach 
maturity at age 7 hanscom said 
the eggs parents were taken from the wild and the male only 
reached maturity last summer but hanscom is convinced condors born 
in captivity also will produce eggs such as the one now watched 
intently 
the chick that hatches from this egg represents the 
regeneration of this species he said captive breeding is 
their only hope for survival

saudi arabia announced it was 
breaking diplomatic relations with tehran and the iranian 
government today said the saudis acted under pressure from the 
united states 
in kuwait an explosion ripped through the office of saudi 
arabias national airline today and injured one guard witnesses 
and officials said kuwait often has blamed bomb attacks inside its 
territory on iranianbacked saboteurs 
saudi arabia said tuesday it decided to sever its ties with iran 
because of a riot by iranians in mecca a raid on the saudi embassy 
in tehran and iranian attacks on commercial shipping in the persian 
gulf 
the government also ordered all iranian diplomats to leave the 
kingdom within a week 
tehran radio quoting a foreign ministry spokesman said saudi 
arabias cooperation with americas conspiracies in the persian 
gulf and its help for the zionist regime of iraq was a reason for 
cutting ties with iran 
earlier this month the us navy attacked iranian oil platforms 
and vessel in retaliation for the planting of a mine that damaged 
an american frigate and injured 10 sailors 
the radio said the saudi decision also was designed to divert 
the attention of moslems from saudi crimes during last years 
pilgrimage to mecca and its decision to limit the number of iranian 
pilgrims permitted to attend the pilgrimage this july the report 
was monitored in nicosia cyprus 
in vienna irans oil minister also blamed the united states 
this saudi decision in my personal view was made under the 
pressure of the united states kazempour ardebili told the 
associated press he was in vienna for a meeting of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the saudi statement translated by the associated press said 
king fadhs government had sought to normalize relations despite 
iranian terrorism and subversion 
but the iranian side persisted in perpetrating hostile 
practices it said 
iranian speedboats attacked a saudiowned tanker in the strait 
of hormuz on sunday just hours after president reagan warned iran 
to stay clear of neutral ships hormuz is the narrow gateway to the 
gulf at the waterways southern end 
reagans warning to iran came after the us navy sank or 
disabled six iranian naval vessels in battles in the persian gulf 
the clashes occurred after the navy destroyed two iranian offshore 
oil facilities to retaliate for a mine explosion in the gulf on 
april 14 that damaged a navy frigate and wounded 10 american 
sailors the united states said iran sowed the mine 
iran which has been at war with iraq since september 1980 
routinely raids commercial ships in the gulf to retaliate for iraqi 
attacks on iranian vessels iraqs attacks on ships owned by or 
doing business with iran are aimed at cutting irans oil revenues 
which help finance the war 
saudi arabia and most other arab countries support iraq in its 
war with iran iran is a moslem nation but its people are persian 
not arab 
iran and saudi arabia have made critical statements about each 
other since riots in mecca on july 31 1987 in which 275 iranian 
pilgrims were killed and the subsequent looting of the saudi 
embassy in tehran a saudi diplomat died of injuries suffered in 
the embassy raid 
saudi officials said 402 saudis and iranians were killed in a 
stampede after a political demonstration by iranian pilgrims in 
mecca became violent iran said saudi police caused most casualties 
by shooting into the crowd 
mecca birthplace of the prophet mohammed and medina site of 
his tomb are the holiest places for the worlds 850 million 
moslems they are in a region of western saudi arabia called hijaz 
and under the custodianship of the saudi royal family 
following the riots iranian leaders called on moslems to 
overthrow the saudi royal family seize its vast wealth and strip 
it of custodianship of the islamic shrines iranian leaders often 
have threatened to export their fundamentalist revolution to saudi 
arabia and other gulf nations 
two weeks ago khomeini said 150000 iranian pilgrims would 
travel to mecca this year and demonstrate against the united states 
and israel 
saudi government officials had said saudi arabia would reduce 
the number of pilgrims traveling to the holy city this year but 
have not given figures iran reacted by threatening to boycott the 
annual pilgrimage

the supreme court today cleared the way for 
the reinstatement of a postal service letter carrier from garden 
city ny fired for failing to deliver more than 3500 pieces of 
mail 
the court let stand an arbitrators ruling that edward hyde is 
entitled to his old job 
hydes case under study by the nations highest court since 
last december was dismissed in a onesentence order 
the justices who had been urged by reagan administration 
lawyers to rule that hydes reinstatement would be contrary to 
public policy said they made a mistake when agreeing to review 
the case 
the court without explanation dismissed the governments 
appeal as improvidently granted automatically upholding a 
federal appeals court ruling that in turn had upheld the 
arbitrators ruling 
in a 1987 ruling the justices unanimously ruled that an 
arbitrators award may be overturned on public policy grounds only 
when the award creates an explicit conflict with laws or legal 
precedent 
in that decision the court stopped short of agreeing with a 
unions contention that such court action is justified only when 
the award itself violates a law or when it forces an employer to 
act illegally 
the justices also did not say how if at all the power of 
federal courts to overturn arbitration awards differs from their 
power to refuse to enforce contracts on public policy grounds 
in hydes case justice department lawyers had argued that he 
should not be reinstated no matter what the standard to be used in 
cases involving private employers 
a general policy of deference to arbitral awards cannot 
override the need to protect the basic public mission of the 
postal service the governments appeal had argued 
police and postal inspectors in 1984 searched hydes car and 
found more than 3500 pieces of undelivered mail addressed to 
residents on his delivery route some of the mail was more than a 
year old 
hyde pleaded guilty to unlawful delay of the mail and was 
sentenced to 18 months probation the postal service fired him 
the national association of letter carriers filed a grievance 
and took the postal service to arbitration over hydes firing 
the arbitrator ordered that hyde be reinstated without back pay 
after taking a 60day medical leave of absence a condition of 
hydes probation on his criminal conviction was that he complete a 
rehabilitation program for compulsive gamblers 
lawyers for hydes union said he is now completely rehabilitated 
chief justice william h rehnquist previously had postponed the 
effect of the appeals court ruling in hydes favor blocking his 
reinstatement until supreme court action on the governments appeal 
todays order presumably will set aside rehnquists order 
the case is us postal service vs national association of 
letter carriers 8759

ten students have been arrested in 
connection with at least 47 automobile burglaries most of them 
committed with tools they made in a high school shop class police 
say 
the arrests were made tuesday at metamora township high school 
no names were released because all 10 two girls and eight boys 
were juveniles when the crimes occurred police said 
charges against the teens aged 15 to 17 include vehicle 
burglary and conspiracy to commit vehicle burglary police have 
linked the group to 47 burglaries 33 in peoria and 14 in tazewell 
and woodford counties 
i guess you could call it a burglary ring said peoria 
police capt lawrence burwell two individuals were making tools 
for their friends to gain entry to vehicles 
burwell said the tools made in shop classes resembled 
slimjims used by police to enter locked cars the tools were 
used in most of the burglaries although some vehicles were entered 
by using coat hangers or breaking windows he said 
they were just driving around and scouting until they saw 
something that looked good burwell said 
money radar detectors and stereo equipment were the most common 
things stolen he said 
stephen eakle the police officer who coordinated the 
investigation said there is evidence some of the students parents 
may have known about the burglaries and possibly bought some of the 
stolen property however he said there was not enough evidence to 
prosecute them 
burwell said the thefts began in late january and the burglary 
ring was discovered by police about a month later metamora police 
finally interrupted a burglary in progress and that arrest led to 
the groups arrest he said

a divorced parent may be held in civil 
contempt and jailed for failing to pay child support even if not 
proved financially able to do so the supreme court ruled today 
by an 80 vote the justices said such a finding of civil 
contempt does not violate constitutionally protected dueprocess 
rights 
but the court said a finding of criminal contempt sparking a 
jail sentence or fine would be unconstitutional without proof the 
parent is able to pay the child support 
todays ruling sends back to state courts a california case in 
which five justices could not determine whether a divorced father 
had been held in civil or criminal contempt for failing to make 
childsupport payments 
philip and alta sue feiock were divorced in orange county 
calif in 1976 as part of the divorce judgment feiock was 
ordered to pay 225 a month in child support for his three children 
after he failed to make any payments a court hearing was held 
in 1984 in which he was ordered to make monthly payments of 150 a 
second hearing was held in 1985 after mrs feiock complained about 
not receiving any child support from her exhusband 
in that hearing state prosecutors proved feiocks knowledge of 
the earlier court order and his failure to comply with it 
feiock testified that he had been unable to pay the child 
support 
a state judge ruled that feiock was in contempt of court and 
gave him a 25day suspended jail sentence feiock was placed on 
three years probation and ordered to begin making the childsupport 
payments or be jailed 
feiock appealed and a state appeals court threw out the 
contempt citation 
the state court said the states childsupport law creates an 
unconstitutional mandatory presumption that a parent is able to 
make the payments thus relieving prosecutors of proving that fact 
in sending the case back to the california courts justice byron 
r white said the high court is uncertain whether feiock was cited 
for civil or criminal contempt 
people may be jailed for either form of contempt of court 
under civil contempt which is considered coercive the jailing 
is indefinite and freedom is granted as soon as the offender 
complies with the underlying court order 
criminal contempt is intended to be punishment and normally 
involves a specific jail term unrelated to compliance with the 
court order 
white said that if feiock would purge his jail sentence by 
making up his missed payments then his proceeding is civil in 
nature and the state law presumption would not violate 
dueprocess rights 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens joined whites opinion 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor and antonin scalia voted to reinstate feiocks contempt 
citation saying his proceeding clearly was civil not criminal 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the case 
in other action the court 
raised the possibility that states may deny unemployment 
benefits to workers fired for using the hallucinogenic drug peyote 
during religious ceremonies 
in a 53 ruling involving two men from oregon the justices 
stopped short of deciding whether there is a constitutional right 
to take peyote as a religious practice 
cleared the way for the reinstatement of a postal service 
letter carrier from garden city ny fired for failing to deliver 
more than 3500 pieces of mail 
the court let stand an arbitrators ruling that edward hyde is 
entitled to his old job 
ruled that a railroad worker is not entitled to be represented 
at an employers disciplinary hearing by his own union when a 
different union is the official collective bargaining agent for 
employees 
the 90 ruling rejected arguments by paul g landers an 
engineer who has worked for amtrak since 1983 on passenger trains 
in the northeast 
the child support case is hicks vs feiock 86787

a bomb exploded today along the kabul 
river in the center of the capital and shattering windows in a 
twosquareblock area six people were killed and 49 injured an 
afghan official said 
the vehicle in which the bomb was planted was destroyed in the 
explosion at 1240 pm 410 am edt but it appeared to have 
been a truck or a small bus three buses and two taxis also were 
damaged 
col gen saifullah who is in charge of security in kabul said 
the dead included four men a woman and a young girl he said 27 of 
the injured were hospitalized 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass reported earlier that 
preliminary information indicated four people were killed and seven 
were injured 
investigating authorities said the truck which arrived in 
kabul from pakistan must have carried an estimated 330 pounds of 
explosives tass said 
foreign journalists were visiting kabul for the 10th anniversary 
of afghanistans marxist revolution which was observed tuesday 
with a massive military parade 
it was not clear whether the vehicles were occupied when the 
explosion occurred 
the explosion was likely the work of anticommunist rebels 
fighting the promoscow government of president najib 
afghan soldiers and police prevented the foreign journalists 
from getting closer than 100 feet to the bombed vehicle whose 
charred chassis lay on the river bank then drove them away 
two of the journalists jonathan landay of united press 
internationals new delhi bureau and japanese photographer 
yasusuke ota were held by police for more than an hour before 
being released 
the police sealed off the densely populated area of the capital 
and warned passersby that there was a danger of other explosions 
the vehicle in which the bomb was planted apparently was parked 
along a gravelly stretch of river bank across a street and about 
200 feet from the nearest building 
afghan shopkeepers spent the afternoon sweeping broken glass and 
rubble from buildings along a twoblock stretch of both sides of 
the river 
western diplomats said earlier this week that rocket strikes on 
the city have become less frequent in recent months as najibs 
troops and soviet soldiers have gained a stronger hold over the 
capital 
but car bombs have been set off by the guerrillas with 
increasing regularity to show opposition to the current government 
and the soviet presence 
a rocket also hit the eastern hills of kabul on the morning of 
the revolution day celebrations 
thousands of soldiers workers and weapons coursed for more than 
two hours on tuesday through ideghi square after a night of 
unusually heavy rifle fire najib led dozens of afghan officials 
and a soviet delegation to the parade about 500 guests and 
visiting journalists were clustered under striped awnings on a 
reviewing stand 
insurgents supported by pakistan the united states and other 
countries have been fighting the afghan government since april 
1978 when a sovietinspired revolution brought a socialist 
government to power 
soviet soldiers entered the war in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 remain to bolster najibs government 
under an agreement signed in geneva on april 14 the soviet 
troops will begin a withdrawal on may 15 that is expected to be 
completed by the end of the year

liberaces attorney said he made more 
than 400000 in legal fees for working on the late entertainers 
estate but testified that the payments were anything but a 
windfall 
beverly hills attorney joel strote on tuesday defended the fees 
as reasonable for work he did in 1987 as executor of liberaces 
estate and trustee for two trusts set up by the famed pianist 
this was a very difficult job that took up almost all of my 
waking hours for all intents and purposes it was my only client 
said strote who billed the estate for 58475 in one month alone 
strote also acknowledged that liberace had provided a separate 
trust for his seven dogs mr liberace loved his dogs and wanted 
to provide for their care after his death strote said 
testifying in a civil suit in state district court brought by 
five liberace associates strote said he charged 250 an hour he 
estimated the value of liberaces estate at 11 million 
strote said he plans to bill the estate the same 250 an hour 
for defending himself in the suit including the three days he has 
spent on the stand 
the five plaintiffs are seeking to remove strote as trustee of 
two trusts and executor of liberaces will claiming strote has 
mismanaged the assets strote was named executor by liberace only 
days before the entertainer died feb 5 1987 
the five include liberaces sister angie his longtime manager 
seymour heller housekeepers dorothy mcmahon and gladys luckie and 
cary james liberaces livein companion for the last seven years 
of his life 
under questioning strote said he had not paid the five 
plaintiffs as provided in the liberace will setting aside their 
money pending the outcome of the current litigation 
strote said the dogs had the run of liberaces homes while the 
entertainer was alive but he had ordered them restricted to certain 
areas when liberace died he said some carpets had been ruined by 
the dogs 
i realized the dogs should be kept in an area where they 
couldnt do any damage so the property could be kept in 
pristine condition strote said 
strote said he had not replaced carpets soiled by the dogs 
because i feel people want the home like he lived in it 
he compared the homes to a classic car saying some people would 
want a cars old worn interior because it was authentic 
strote said the stained carpets were not replaced before the 
houses were shown because i felt this enhanced the value

the may 4 deadline for illegal aliens to 
request amnesty will not be extended says an author of the new 
immigration law 
you have until may 4 and after that there will never be 
another extension since any belief in that would only serve to 
increase illegal immigration sen alan simpson rwyo said in 
a speech tuesday 
although there is considerable pressure on congress to extend 
the deadline simpson noted the house and senate will be in recess 
when the deadline passes and there is no way it will be extended 
the new law gave aliens who had been in this country since 
before 1981 from may 4 1987 through may 4 1988 to sign up for a 
legalization program simpson said the immigration and 
naturalization service has been approving 95 percent of the 
applications 
simpson said aliens who cannot get immediate documentation that 
they have been in the united states for the required period should 
report to the ins before the deadline and they will be allowed to 
furnish documents later

solidarity leader lech walesa called today 
for nationwide pressure on authorities during a massive strike by 
steelworkers and the government said unrest was spreading 
government spokesman jerzy urban said the number of strikers at 
the lenin steel mills outside krakow grew to at least 2000 since 
the strike began tuesday he said a bus drivers strike in 
bydgoszcz on monday ignited demands for drivers pay increases in 
other cities 
ewa kaberna a solidarity activist in stalowa wola in southeast 
poland announced a call for a strike at the start of the first 
shift friday at the 18000worker heavy machinery plant there for 
pay increases of 50 a month 
in a statement issued in gdansk walesa said our union 
appeals to all living social forces for the undertaking of 
united actions to put pressure on the authorities 
at the moment we need a new policy which would fully answer 
the questions worrying polish families and which would restore 
societys rights he said millions of people are waiting 
for restoration of the rights of their trade union solidarity 
the labor unrest appeared to be the most serious in poland since 
the december 1981 martiallaw crackdown suppressed the solidarity 
independent labor federation which remains banned although its 
leadership is still active 
strikes over higher prices have a long tradition in postwar 
poland and caused government shakeups in 1956 1970 and 1980 when 
a wave of strikes helped give rise to solidarity 
urban in a telephone interview said the government has 
predicted payrelated conflicts so it is true that the strikes 
may spread 
the situation in poland is getting hotter and hotter anything 
can happen any place walesa told reporters tuesday in warsaw 
the steel strike began one day after a strike by 2800 transit 
workers in the western city of bydgoszcz shut down buses and trams 
for 11 hours and won a 60 percent increase in hourly wages 
urban said city transit workers in lodz torun and grudziadz 
asked for raises in the wake of the bydgoszcz settlement and that 
nationwide talks were planned with official transit union 
representatives thursday 
he said about 2000 people were on strike at midday at the lenin 
mill in a peaceful and matteroffact atmosphere opposition 
spokesmen estimated the number of strikers as 70 percent to 80 
percent of the 10000 firstshift workers 
workers rejected an offer broadcast over loudspeakers at the 
start of the afternoon shift for a 50 monthly raise to be phased 
in by october solidarity adviser jacek kuron said in warsaw 
workers originally sought increases of 30 a month but later 
raised their demands to an immediate 50 percent raise kuron and 
other opposition activists said monthly pay now averages about 
105 union activists said 
the talks also concern the economic condition of retirees and 
the state of the national health service said zbigniew lenyk an 
opposition spokesman in krakow 
urban said negotiations were taking place between worker 
representatives and plant management 
in his statement read over the telephone by solidarity national 
spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz walesa said solidarity has been 
calling attention to the lack of improvement in the economy for 
months 
growing feelings of harm and hopelessness are causing strike 
actions he said solidarity fully supports actions in defense 
of living standards 
in addition to higher wages a strike committee formed at the 
32000worker plant in nowa huta demanded amnesty for strikers 
news coverage of the walkout and reinstatement of workers fired for 
past union activities 
the staterun news agency pap on its englishlanguage service 
today carried its first report on the nowa huta strike and said 
plant managers should resist the strikers demands there were no 
polishlanguage media reports on the strike 
stanislaw sitkowski the head of the officially sanctioned union 
at the lenin works today said many members of his union were 
taking part in the strike we are of the opinion that wages are 
too low he said 
the steel mills comprise the main industry in nowa huta a city 
built outside krakow after world war ii as a model of socialist 
society 
prices climbed 42 percent in this years first quarter the 
government says mainly as the result of a government economic 
reform program that aims to make prices more realistic in part by 
reducing subsidies for staples 
but the higher prices have led to demands for pay raises

george bush today celebrated his early lockup 
of the republican presidential nomination and declared i cant 
wait to debate whomever the democrats nominate president reagan 
edged closer to a formal endorsement of his vice president 
reagan asked by reporters if he was ready to end his official 
position of neutrality replied im going to have to arrive at 
that if there are no others in competition for the nomination 
the vice president who stood virtually alone after his five 
rivals for the nomination folded or froze their campaigns coasted 
to a mathematical victory in the republican contest tuesday with a 
final push from the voters of pennsylvania 
he said he would keep campaigning in the gop primaries since 
i dont want to project an overconfidence or an arrogance that i 
dont feel and that i have no reason to feel 
bush in brief interviews said on nbctv that he was prepared 
to debate massachusetts gov michael dukakis or whomever else the 
democrats might nominate and he challenged dukakis on cbstv to 
fire away on the irancontra issue 
he said his vice presidential running mate will have to be 
someone he feels comfortable with since i wouldnt want to look 
over my shoulder wondering if the vice president in his moral 
outrage would be carving me up every day building his own agenda 
or her own agenda 
bush noted that the democratic party has won most blacks votes 
for decades but he said that could change if jacksons supporters 
dont like the way he is treated as the campaign plays out 
if hes not treated fairly a lot of people are going to be 
openminded and if i campaign properly with the way i feel in my 
heart about openness and inclusion we might surprise people 
there bush said 
bush who won the pennsylvania gop primary with 79 percent of 
the vote early today surpassed the 1139 delegates needed to win 
the partys presidential nomination according to the associated 
press delegate count 
the vice president met briefly in the morning with reagan and 
white house chief of staff howard baker but reagan told reporters 
later that bushs clinching of the nomination was so recent i 
havent even congratulated him yet which im going to do about 
his going to the top 
but already bush was beginning to focus on the fall election 
he took the opportunity tuesday to attack democratic frontrunner 
dukakis saying the massachusetts governor lacks the experience 
needed to handle foreign policy 
that will be a major issue in the fall bush said 
what may not be an issue is charisma with bush and dukakis both 
battling an image of being lackluster campaigners 
whats wrong with being a boring kind of guy bush said 
running for president is serious business anyway he added 
i kind of think im a scintillating type of fellow 
bush entered the republican race as the partys frontrunner and 
got off to a shaky start with a thirdplace finish in the iowa 
caucuses in february he bounced back with a victory eight days 
later in the new hampshire primary 
all through the campaign bush managed to stay on top of the 
race for national convention delegates despite a strong early 
challenge by kansas sen bob dole 
bush turned the nomination battle into a rout by sweeping his 
partys 16 super tuesday primaries on march 8 
clinching the delegates prompted bush to acknowledge he had won 
the nomination with the gop convention in new orleans still four 
months distant and with former tv evangelist pat robertson still 
offering token resistance 
robertson issued a statement late tuesday saying i 
congratulate george bush today on his magnificent victory i 
plan to suggest that he and i meet together in the near future to 
discuss ways that i and my supporters might be helpful 
bush plans to summon republican governors and experts on foreign 
policy and economics for a weeklong session in june at his home in 
kennebunkport maine to help him shape issues for the fall 
campaign according to spokesman peter teeley 
the session will take place while reagan is attending the 
ussoviet summit in moscow teeley said

navy salvage workers who boarded the uss 
bonefish as the abandoned submarine drifted in the atlantic today 
found the bodies of the three men missing after explosions and fire 
rocked the ship navy officials said 
a navy salvage crew boarded the submarine tuesday but had to 
pump out toxic gases swirling through the hull before they could 
enter the ship which had been adrift since sunday 
the dead were identified as lt ray everts jr 30 of naoma 
wva petty officer 1st class robert w bordelon jr 39 of 
willis texas and petty officer 3rd class marshall t lindgren 
21 of pisgah forest nc 
chief petty officer terry d borton a spokesman at atlantic 
fleet headquarters here said two of the bodies were found at their 
stations in the control room of the ship and a third was found in 
an administrative compartment 
the rest of the 92man crew escaped serious injury when they 
abandoned the 219foot 30yearold vessel which was drifting 
alongside two salvage ships 160 miles east of port canaveral fla 
the navy anticipates towing the vessel to its homeport of 
charleston sc said chief petty officer joseph c mowery 
another fleet spokesman the salvageships uss petrel and uss hoist 
are assessing the safety and manner of towing the ship back to 
port he said 
the causes of death would not be known until a full medical 
report was done borton said the salvage crew entered the vessel 
shortly after midnight to test for toxic gases left by the fire in 
the dieselelectric subs forward battery compartment 
lt michael langston chaplain at the asheville naval reserve 
center in asheville nc said he was told to notify lindgrens 
mother and brother in nearby pisgah forest shes pretty 
distraught he said of mrs lindgren 
everts sister cynthia williams said the navy had sent someone 
to their house this morning to announce that everts body had been 
found the navy gave no further details said williams of naoma 
wed really rather not say anything yet said williams 
adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval operations said 
tuesday in washington that the three men were on watch in the subs 
control room and may have died at their posts as they made sure 
everyone got clear 
another sailor said however that the men were newly assigned 
to the ship and may have gotten lost in the smoke and gas that 
filled the hull 
avery thought maybe they got confused and got turned around in 
the smoke alice causey mother of petty officer 1st class avery 
causey said tuesday 
causey said he himself was blinded by the smoke and was only 
able to escape because a wave washing over the ship guided him to 
an open hatch 
even though the emergency lights were on he couldnt see 
them none of the drills they do could have prepared them for 
what happened said mrs causey who is from jacksonville fla 
causey 30 was one of 89 of the bonefishs 92 crewmen evacuated 
sunday after explosions and fire filled the vessel with smoke and 
toxic gases three of 22 injured crewmen remain hospitalized 
the bonefishs captain cmdr mike wilson praised the heroism 
of his crew it was a very harrowing experience we went through 
out there he said upon arrival tuesday in charleston sc his 
ships home port 
wilson would not comment further because an investigation of the 
fire is pending said lt cmdr john tull public affairs officer 
at the charleston naval base 
the navy said the first explosion hit the bonefish on sunday 
afternoon as it was running at periscope depth engaged in training 
exercises with surface vessels 160 miles off florida 
the crew was able to surface the bonefish and wilson ordered the 
evacuation crew members abandoned ship and were taken to shore by 
the aircraft carrier john f kennedy and the frigate uss carr 
a fiveman salvage crew aboard the bonefish waited for strong 
winds and rough seas to subside tuesday afternoon then conducted 
tests that found high concentrations of toxic gases inside said 
lt fred henney a spokesman for the atlantic fleet in norfolk 
theyre pumping air through the ship to get the toxic gases to 
leave he said henney said he did not know what type of gases 
were in the vessel 
a civilian submarine expert said the 30yearold bonefish one 
of the navys last remaining dieselelectric subs was probably 
full of toxic chlorine gas created by fire in the shipss forward 
battery compartment 
the typical accident happens when hydrogen builds up in the 
battery compartments while the sub is charging the batteries 
said norman friedman author of submarine design and 
development 
the sub is powered on the surface by diesel engines but when 
submerged it uses electric motors powered by two battery 
compartments the batteries are recharged by a generator when the 
ship is surfaced or at periscope depth 
a spark ignites the hydrogen and remember the ship is full 
of electric motors and you have an explosion followed by a fire 
and that fire produces the chlorine gas friedman said 
the navy would neither confirm nor deny that the submarine was 
charging its batteries at the time

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
april 21 
the providence ri journal on the democratic presidential 
race 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts is now the likely 
presidential nominee of the democratic party in 1988 
he is likely to be the nominee but for reasons that may not 
serve him so well in november 
he clearly appeals to a wider range of democrats than jesse 
jackson but somehow lacks the capacity to generate enthusiasm 
among potential supporters 
he has not sprinted to his frontrunner status but worn his 
opponents down to the governors way of thinking this may 
constitute a hidden advantage after eight years of charisma he 
suggests perhaps competence will appeal to voters 
perhaps it will but with a moscow summit at the end of next 
month another armscontrol agreement apparently in the works with 
the economy booming unemployment declining a stabilized dollar 
shrunken inflation peace talks in managua and the russians 
backing out of their afghan war its an uphill journey for any 
democratic candidate

los angeles daily news on the kuwaiti airliner hijacking 
the 16day hijacking of a kuwaiti jumbo jet ended without 
the kuwaiti government capitulating to the hijackers demands for 
the release of 17 proiranian terrorists 
it wasnt a total victory the hijackers after all got away 
with murder but give kuwait credit for setting the right example 
the terrorists set out to free their cohorts and they came away 
emptyhanded 
kuwait apparently had to give ground in two ways first in 
return for surrendering the jetliner and their hostages the gunmen 
received safe passage out of algeria second unconfirmed 
reports indicated that the kuwaiti emir agreed to commute the 
death sentences of three of the 17 imprisoned terrorists to life 
 
kuwait and other nations including the united states should 
now spare no expense in their efforts to track down and arrest 
those responsible for the hijacking 
after all the hijackers commandeered a jet killed two innocent 
people terrorized dozens of others focused world attention on 
their cause and then slipped back under their rocks no worse for 
wear 
kuwait meanwhile should not delay in carrying out the death 
sentences against the three terrorists who were sentenced to death 
for the bombings of the us and french embassies in december 1983

farmington nm daily times on the airline smoking ban 
airline passengers on domestic flights lasting two hours or less 
are breathing easier 
thats because a new faa rule that took effect saturday 
prohibits smoking on those flights 
the hazards of cigarette smoking and breathing secondhand 
smoke have been well documented 
we believe that those who choose to smoke should have the right 
to do so as long as that action does not infringe on the rights 
of nonsmokers to breathe clean air 
with smokers now in the sizable minority its not too much to 
ask that they cease their habit for two hours or less for the 
comfort of nonsmoking travel companions

the mcpherson kan sentinel on attorney general meese 
if president reagan is keeping attorney general edwin meese on 
the job out of loyalty to an old friend he certainly doesnt need 
any enemies 
nearly every day a new report pops up detailing the mans lack 
of judgment lack of common sense ineptitude or shameful disregard 
for ethics in government 
todays report for example comes from former assistant 
attorney general lawrence wallace who says that meese participated 
in justice department deliberations affecting telephone companies 
in which he owned stock 
obviously with those kinds of ethics meese shouldnt be this 
nations number one law enforcement officer and reagan should fire

the kansas city mo times on the trade bill 
the comprehensive trade bill approved by the house of 
representatives is an improvement over the overly protective 
measure that existed just two months ago but thats not saying 
much 
the trade bill as now written includes several provisions that 
could allow the united states to take retaliatory action with 
quotas and tariffs against other nations 
funny usually when these goods enter the united states 
americans buy them because they are built well or because they are 
less costly than usmade goods 
if the senate doesnt water down this measure reagan should

individual losses incurred might be more equitable it is 
impractical almost 50 years after the fact 
money of course cannot compensate these americans and their 
families for the loss of their homes jobs and businesses 
nor can it make up for the shame and sorrow they suffered at the 
hands of a government which did not see the error in violating the 
constitution at the same time it was fighting a war to defend it 
 
the nation cannot repay the 77000 american citizens of japanese 
ancestry and the 43000 legal and illegal aliens for depriving them 
of their rights but conscience demands that it make this 
longoverdue gesture of heartfelt regret

north jersey advance flanders nj on larry speakes and 
presidential quotes 
whether or not former white house spokesman larry speakes 
committed some cardinal sin by attributing quotes to 
president reagan that he did not utter is debatable 
but it is a fact that reagan either tolerated his doing so did 
not know about it or alas does not remember again 
reagan sidestepped the question did you approve of the 
process and would you continue to allow that to happen in your 
white house 
reagan responded that he just learned it recently as all the 
rest of you did 
he went on to speak of his lack of affection for the kiss and 
tell books 
in seeking to deflect the question the president all but 
admitted that he had condoned what speakes did it was the telling 
not the kissing that he found objectionable

the rapid city sd journal on the conservation reserve 
program 
the recent drought has made blowing topsoil more visible in 
south dakota but its nothing new 
easily erodible soil is best left undisturbed depleting soil 
destroys a resource that we depend upon for life itself 
thats why the success of the federal conservation reserve a 
program that pays farmers to return easily eroded croplands to 
undisturbed tree and grassland sanctuaries for wildlife is 
encouraging this is part of the federal farm program that makes a 
great deal of sense 
considering the values promoted by the conservation reserve and 
alternatives it is a remarkably worthwhile federal initiative 
the conservation reserve program does cost some money 
so did the dust bowl

the knoxville tenn newssentinel on sen robert byrd 
the old fiddle player from west virginia sen robert byrd is 
trading in his senate democratic leadership for the chairmanship of 
the appropriations committee 
its fitting that byrd 70 should step aside and let younger 
blood into the leadership 
in announcing his intention to give up the democratic 
leadership byrd said it has been a 30yearold goal of his to head 
the appropriations committee hes entitled but there is something 
disconcerting about his reason for wanting it 
even the chairman of the state republican party welcomed the 
news with the comment in west virginia we may oppose pork 
barrel projects as a concept but by god if they are going to 
come to west virginia were not going to oppose them 
west virginia deserves a fair share from the washington till 
but lets hope that after byrd takes over the committee the 
federal government wont suddenly start moving those rugged west 
virginia mountains around for the big defense implacements and that 
multibilliondollar canals and dams wont begin to sprout among the 
hills

the duluth minn newstribune on the supreme courts 
alcoholism decision 
everybody knows that if you want a medical opinion you go to a 
doctor and not a lawyer 
yet four us supreme court justices rendered what is widely 
interpreted as a medical opinion that could have a negative 
effect on attitudes toward alcoholism for years to come 
while insisting it was not directly addressing the question of 
whether alcoholism is a disease or a weakness of character the 
court erred on the side of imprudence when it ruled two veterans 
who suffered from alcoholism cannot qualify for certain government 
benefits because their drinking was the result of willful 
misconduct weakness of character 
this diagnosis has come from the field of law and not 
medicine recognition of alcoholism as a disease has led to 
breakthroughs in treatment of afflicted individuals and in the 
treatment of those individuals by society particularly in the 
courts excepting now the supreme court 
if alcoholism is not a disease in the eyes of the federal 
government then how long will it be before jail becomes the 
principal treatment center at the local level and the town drunk 
is reinstated as an object of ridicule

the times gainesville ga on attorney general meese 
attorney general edwin meese got another whack across the ears 
last week when yet another choice to be his top deputy said no 
most mules pay a little attention after a few whacks how long 
how many before meese understands 
all of the numerous probes into his activities may show him to 
be perfectly innocent of any criminal wrongdoing he is entitled to 
that presumption 
but he is guilty of tremendously bad judgment in hanging on to 
his office when doing so is eroding public confidence in the 
departments integrity destroying morale within the department and 
eroding support for the president he serves 
the only worse judgment weve seen in this affair is that of 
president reagan in not telling him its time to go

former us rep john jenrette who was 
convicted eight years ago in the federal abscam investigation 
announced today that he will not seek his old congressional seat in 
this years elections 
jenrette calling it one of the most painful decisions i have 
ever had to make said he will not be a candidate because of his 
inability to settle legal claims arising from former business deals 
he also said federal judge has declined to terminate his parole 
for his abscam conviction a condition of that parole was that he 
not leave the state without checking with his parole officer 
the failure to be relieved of probation and the inability to 
settle these old but just and legal claims causes me to be in a 
much different position than i had expected to be as a candidate 
he said at a news conference 
jenrette who represented the 6th district for six years was 
convicted in october 1980 of conspiracy and accepting a 50000 
bribe from an fbi agent posing as an arab shiek 
the 51yearold former congressman a recovering alcoholic and 
disbarred attorney has set up a public relations firm in florence 
and in recent months has been testing the political waters for a 
challenge of popular incumbent congressman robin tallon a fellow 
democrat 
jenrette lost to republican john napier the month after his 
abscam conviction tallon defeated napier two years later and has 
held the seat since 
jenrette said he owed 175000 to the myrtle beach air force 
base credit union to settle claims arising from the old heritage 
shores development project he said he has paid 75000 of that and 
had hoped to exchange a piece of property to settle he rest of the 
claim 
but credit union officials did not agree to that arrangement 
in february the state attorney general ordered jenrette to pay 
more than 100000 that investors lost in timesharing rights at an 
edisto island resort 
ninetyfive people lost investments of up to 6000 apiece when 
loans for club oristo were defaulted in 1980 before construction 
was completed on the property 
i cannot ask my friends to make the sacrifices necessary until 
such time as i might be able to get my personal and business 
affairs in order i will not be a candiate in 1988 jenrette said 
asked if he would be a candidate for public office in the 
future jenrette said i dont know about that i hope to be able 
to contribute in some way 
he added that he expects tallon to be the democratic nominee and 
that he would support the nominee of the party 
the story of john and rita jenrette made headlines across the 
nation during the early 1980s jenrette along with six other former 
members of congress were convicted in the abscam probe 
rita jenrette later posed in playboy magazine and wrote an 
expose about life in congress including an account of the two 
making love on the capitol steps and their acrimonious divorce

a man whose pregnant wife took the state bar 
exam for him after he flunked was sentenced to three years 
probation in a ruling decried by his nowdivorced wife as too 
lenient 
morgan lamb 35 of los angeles was also ordered tuesday to 
perform 500 hours of community service in connection with his 
january conviction on three felony counts of forgery and false 
impersonation 
lambs exwife laura beth salant 32 was put on probation last 
year after pleading no contest to a pair of felony false 
impersonation counts her conviction was subsequently reduced to a 
misdemeanor 
ms salant who attracted attention by finishing the test with 
grades ranked third among 7668 applicants contended she was 
physically and emotionally abused until she agreed to take the 
threeday test for lamb 
lamb who had failed the bar with marks in the bottom fifth of 
his test group claimed it was all his wifes idea 
i dont see how any reasonable judge could not give him a jail 
term ms salant said but then its not reasonable to expect 
that morgan lamb would tell the truth about what happened 
los angeles superior court judge judith chirlin refused to take 
sides during lambs sentencing saying both parties should be 
considered equally to blame since both are law school graduates 
but a probation report said lamb wasnt sophisticated enough to 
have devised the test fraud scheme calling ms salant the brains 
behind the deception 
the couple met while they were law students at the university of 
california los angeles and ms salant went on to become a highly 
praised lawyer with the federal securities and exchange commission 
she lost her sec job after the test fraud allegations surfaced 
and could be disbarredr

troops tracked down and killed two arab 
guerrillas who infiltrated israel attacked an israeli truck with 
guns and a hand grenade and wounded its driver today the army said 
it was the second day in a row arab guerrillas from lebanon have 
clashed with soldiers inside israel the new attack occurred about 
two miles from tuesdays border clash in which two israeli 
soldiers and three palestinian guerrillas were killed military 
sources said 
it was not immediately clear if the guerrillas infiltrated 
israel today or came with the group that entered from lebanon 
tuesday 
in beirut george habashs marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine one of eight factions in the palestine 
liberation organization and the lebanese communist party headed 
by george hawi claimed responsibility for todays attack 
the army closed roads in northern israel and ordered women and 
children in the dozen settlements north of kiryat shmona to stay 
indoors while troops searched for the guerrillas by foot and 
helicopter police in northern israel said 
the guerrillas armed with light weapons and other hand 
grenades evaded troops for three hours until they were discovered 
and killed in a nearby dry riverbed military sources said 
the truck driver danny dahan was attacked at tank 
junction where a ruin of a soviet tank used by the syrians in 
the 1967 middle east war stands as a memorial the sources said he 
was shot in the hand and taken to nearby safed hospital where he 
was operated on a doctor at the hospital said 
after the truck attack israeli men from the settlements were 
ordered to take up arms and go to assigned guard posts said zvi 
yuval 37 from kibbutz senir about three miles south of the 
border during the search he heard continuous gunfire including 
shots from helicopters yuval said in a telephone interview 
we fear there will be more attacks this summer the vegetation 
is like a jungle giving guerrillas places to hide yuval said 
it was the 12th penetration or infiltration attempt since nov 
26 when a lone guerrilla landed a hang glider in northern israel 
and killed six soldiers before he was shot to death himself 
earlier in the day a un source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the the army fired artillery and flares early today 
near where the israeli soldiers and guerrillas clashed tuesday 
army radio reported explosions in the area overnight but it 
gave no details 
also today a 14yearold palestinian girl died of wounds 
suffered a day earlier after israeli troops opened fire on arab 
protesters in a village in the occupied west bank army officials 
said 
the death brought to 174 the number of arabs killed in 
antioccupation unrest in the west bank and gaza strip which 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war two israelis also have 
died since the rioting began dec 8 
in syria palestinian officials said yasser arafat chairman of 
the palestine liberation organization plans to escalate the 
5monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied territories the 
officials spoke on condition of anonymity after arafat finished 
talks with syrian president hafez assad and headed for iraq 
in beirut the democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
claimed responsibility for the border attack on tuesday the 
statement was accompanied by what the group said were photographs 
of the three slain guerrillas 
gen yossi peled head of the armys northern command said the 
guerrillas had planned to attack israeli settlements israel 
television said they had carried a map of settlements in the area 
the army said tuesday the soldiers spotted the infiltrators 
footprints and tracked them it said the guerrillas hid in thick 
bushes inside israel and opened fire when the army unit approached 
but an earlier report from a lebanese police spokesman said the 
guerrillas were apparently ambushed before launching a 
crossborder raid into northern israel 
in arab east jerusalem most stores remained closed after 
merchants voted tuesday night to extend a strike through thursday 
to protest the arrest of 14 shopkeepers who violated police orders 
arab reports identified the dead palestinian girl as arish 
ismail daoud adik 
the reports said two dozen soldiers in five jeeps on tuesday 
entered kufr dik a village 20 miles southwest of nablus to break 
up a demonstration by teenagers who blocked roads with stones and 
hung outlawed palestinian flags from utility poles 
troops chased the teenagers to the yard of the village mosque 
and opened fire and miss adik was struck by a bullet to the head 
the reports said 
the armys chief education officer brig gen nehemiah dagan 
also said today israeli soldiers commit an average of 200 
excessive acts against palestinians in the occupied territories 
each month 
dagan in remarks to israeli educators did not elaborate on 
what he meant by excessive acts but said he was concerned about how 
five months of confrontation with palestinian protesters would 
affect young soldiers moral values 
the soldier stands there with a club in his hand and gets a 
rock thrown in his face the daily hadashot quoted dagan as 
saying two thousand years of life in exile pour into the hand 
holding that club

the top official of the organization of 
american states has told secretary of state george p shultz that 
us food shipments to nicaraguan rebels based in honduras are 
illegal the oas said wednesday 
oas secretary general joao baena soares a member of the 
commission assigned to verify compliance with the temporary 
ceasefire agreement between the contras and the sandinista 
government stated his position in a letter sent to shultz on 
monday the oas said 
the dispute involves 479 million in humanitarian assistance 
approved by congress four weeks ago after the contras and the 
sandinistas signed their agreement 
the us agency for international development was assigned the 
task of managing the aid program and has sent 1256 metric tons of 
food by truck to contra camps in honduras starting last week 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega accused the united states 
last friday of concealing weapons and ammunition in the shipments 
aid denied that allegation asserting the trucks were inspected 
and found to be free of lethal equipment by members of the honduran 
clergy before the trucks departed the honduran capital of 
tegucigalpa 
in his letter to shultz baena soares said he believes the 
shipments do not fall within the provision of the instruments 
which regulate the deliveries of humanitarian assistance 
the temporary truce signed at sapoa nicaragua a month ago 
permits the rebels to receive humanitarian assistance but the 
sandinista government has said deliveries can be made to the rebels 
only after they resettle in designated ceasefire zones in 
nicaragua 
the contras and the sandinistas have reached agreement on the 
location of the zones but differences remain over ground rules 
governing activities inside these areas meanwhile the contras 
have not resettled in them 
an aid official speaking wednesday only on condition of 
anonymity said there was nothing in the sapoa agreement or the 
legislation which would preclude delivery of assistance to rebels 
in honduras 
the administration also has been worried about signs of 
increasing hunger among the thousands of rebel fighters many have 
crossed into honduras from nicaragua in recent weeks in search of 
food 
the nicaraguan position is that the verification commission is 
the only body authorized to assure that aid shipments are 
restricted to humanitarian items it maintains that the commission 
can begin verifying compliance with the agreement only when the 
rebels have resettled in the ceasefire zones 
baena soares is one of two members appointed to the commission 
at the sapoa talks the other is nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando 
y bravo who has not yet passed judgment on the legality of the aid 
deliveries officials said 
talks between the sandinistas and the contras on the aid issue 
and other topics resume thursday in managua 
baena soares left washington for managua on wednesday to take 
part in the talks

mayor edward i koch said he stands by his 
criticism of the rev jesse jackson before new yorks democratic 
primary but says he regrets that his belligerent style and sharply 
worded attacks offended jacksons supporters 
in a statement released hours after police commissioner benjamin 
ward called on the mayor to apologize for his divisive remarks 
koch said he had articulated my concerns in a way that 
regrettably offended a large number of people both black and 
white 
i would hope they will look beyond my style to the substance 
of what i said which i believe was fair political criticism 
the words i used were too sharp these are words i have used 
for years because of the particular sensitivity of this situation 
i should have been more careful in my choice of words 
it was highly unusual for ward the citys first black police 
commissioner and a koch appointee to comment on political matters 
that did not directly involve the police department but he said he 
felt the need to do so because he was being asked regularly about 
kochs antijackson efforts 
in a letter that appeared in todays editions of the new york 
times koch said it was never my intent to draw political lines 
with racial or religious borders 
ward said today he was absolutely satisfied that the mayor 
never intended to insult the black community 
kochs attacks on jackson have brought a continued backlash and 
have prompted early efforts to form a coalition to defeat the mayor 
next year when it is expected he will seek a fourth term 
when asked if koch was apologizing to jackson as well as his 
supporters the mayors press secretary george arzt responded 
whatever the letter says were not going beyond it

a barrier was built at center stage a symbol 
of the split between arab and jew so volatile was the mix so 
tense the topics that nobody was quite sure if all the panelists 
would show up 
but it happened almost as planned and officials at abc said 
they were pleased after bringing palestinians and jews together 
wednesday for a marathon nightline session live from the holy 
land 
it worked anchor ted koppel told reporters after the nearly 
3hour show at the jerusalem theater we got israeli jews and 
palestinians to sit together in public and hold a dialogue 
thats unusual 
the dialogue was not always pleasant the panelists four 
israeli legislators and three palestinian academics took turns 
angering sections of the crowd made up of both jews and arabs 
but koppel said the fact that nobody came to blows was an 
achievement 
there was a real concern that these deep emotional feelings 
would erupt into violence koppel said so in that respect 
alone this was a big success 
the show expanded from its normal one hour was called a town 
meeting by abc and was planned as the highlight of a week of 
nightline broadcasts from israel 
the network filled the theater with a handpicked audience of 
750 including about 150 palestinians from the occupied 
territories the palestinians many of whom wore checkered arab 
scarves sat on the left side of the theater the israelis many 
wearing knitted skullcaps sat on the right 
most of the palestinians arrived at the theater a plush complex 
behind president chaim herzogs residence in buses provided by the 
network 
nightline executive producer richard kaplan said defense 
minister yitzhak rabin had intervened to make sure the buses passed 
quickly through army checkpoints 
during much of the show koppel straddled a barrier separating 
the palestinian panelists from the israelis he said the barrier 
built hastily the night before was demanded by the arab 
participants 
they meant to show they were not talking directly to the 
israelis they were talking to me koppel said the arab 
panelists never focused on the israelis looking only at koppel or 
the audience 
the barrier only was part of the delicate diplomatic 
maneuvering needed to recruit arab panelists kaplan said adding 
that until shortly before the show the network was not sure if it 
had a panel 
koppel opened the show at 630 am 1130 pm edt with a plea 
to the audience to keep cool 
i know you will have strong opinions but please have enough 
respect for each other to express them in the form of a dialogue 
he said 
tensions ran high throughout the program starting when hanan 
mikail shwari a dean at bir zeit university in the west bank 
called arab stonethrowing a symbolic act many israelis 
guffawed in disbelief or hissed loudly 
they reacted angrily again when saib erekat a professor at 
nablus an najah university said the arab uprising carries a 
message of peace 
palestinians booed when eliahu ben elissar a rightwing 
legislator from prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc said 
conditions were better for arabs under israeli rule 
the arabisraeli dispute was not the only cause of friction at 
one point israeli legislator haim ramon of the centrist labor 
party tangled with his likud counterparts prompting one viewer to 
call out we need another barrier 
koppel took breaks from the dialogue to screen brief tv spots 
in one report an arab family cowered inside their house in the 
west bank city of nablus as israeli troops fired tear gas and 
rubber bullets outside 
a second showed a night patrol by an israeli soldier who spoke 
of being attacked with huge rocks by hostile arabs who hate us 
a third report which recounted past palestinian terror attacks 
left some jews in the audience in tears another examined israeli 
tactics against arabs such as deportations and house demolitions 
mubarak awad a palestinian who advocates nonviolent resistance 
to israels occupation said the show helped to break images 
i think palestinians saw israelis could be civilized and 
israelis saw palestinians could be civilized he said 
an israeli viewer adam hanover said the show would have been 
more useful if it pitted palestinian leaders against israeli 
leaders its too bad we didnt have the plo here hanover said

maybe the new federal tax law isnt so 
confusing after all 
the internal revenue service said wednesday that the number of 
taxpayers who asked for automatic fourmonth extensions of the 
april 15 filing deadline was 184 percent below last years mark 
slightly over 5 million extensions were requested last year and 
because of the new law the irs had anticipated 62 million this 
year 
we dont know how to interpret that 184 percent reduction 
irs spokesman jeff krasney said he added however that since the 
agency was concentrating on processing returns before handling 
extensions statistics on the number of extensions may not be 
totally up to date 
next weeks figures might give a truer picture of 
extensions he said 
through april 22 the irs had received 949 million returns up 
11 percent over the same period of 1987 krasney said the agency 
had processed 6412 million up 05 percent 
the irs said 79 percent or 5066 million of the processed 
returns qualified for refunds down from 796 percent or 5077 
million at the same time last year the average refund this year is 
842 up 07 percent from the 837 last year

president reagan today gave his permission for 
canada to buy tightlyheld us nuclear submarine technology but 
he and canadian prime minister brian mulroney appeared to make 
little headway in settling a dispute over acid rain 
the leaders met at the white house for an hour to discuss their 
differences over the acid rain pollution problem but nobody 
tried to bridge the disagreements a senior us official said 
the official said that during a halfhour private session 
mulroney presented some new ideas on the issue but further 
discussions between experts will be required before it can be 
determined if the proposals are palatable to the united states 
the canadian government is considering the purchase of 10 or 12 
nuclearpowered attack submarines either from britain or france 
since the british trafalgar class subs use american power 
plants us permission will be required if the canadians pick the 
british design 
the official said reagan informed mulroney that he would approve 
the technology transfer making canada the first nation outside 
britain to be eligible to acquire the technology 
congressional approval also is necessary 
mulroney with reagan standing beside him at a welcoming 
ceremony on the south lawn of the white house reminded the 
president that they had pledged during a meeting in canada to work 
together on the acid rain problem 
this as you said in quebec city mr president is a problem 
that belongs to both of us we must continue and we shall to work 
together for an equitable solution to this important challenge 
mulroney said 
reagan in his welcoming remarks asserted that progress had 
been made in improving air quality 
smoke from cannons that boomed out a salute wafted over the 
white house grounds as mulroney stood at reagans side 
reagan said the agreement would lead to an unshackling of 
uscanadian trading relations 
im confident that the legislatures of both countries will 
vote favorably on this historic free trade agreement reagan said 
mulroney was quoted last week as saying that us acid rain 
emissions are similar to the united states dumping garbage in 
canada 
asked at a brief photo opportunity before his meeting with 
reagan if he stood by the comment mulroney said 
i think it is very clear the acid rain has that effect in the 
eastern united states and canada yes i think thats a normal 
fact 
on friday the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said it was unlikely the two countries would reach an accord on 
acid rain by jan 20 when the reagan administration leaves office 
the official said no i dont it is a difference in approach 
canada wants the united states to set specific targets and 
timetables for the reduction of emissions causing acid rain the 
us official insisted that scientists have not yet discovered a 
way to judge the success of such an effort 
if you are going to put a lot of money into something you had 
better make sure you have the right technology the official 
said you had better know there is a direct relationship between 
what you are doing and where the acid deposition is coming from 
asked if the reagan administration is concerned about the cost 
of a cleanup the official said it is too dear if you are using 
the wrong technologies and when you get all done you havent solved 
the canada problem people are just simply very reluctant to say 
here we go full tilt and when you get done you havent solved 
the problem as it addresses itself in the uscanadian 
relationship 
underscoring the differences us diplomats negotiating in 
geneva on an international pollution agreement this week demanded a 
right for the united states to emit 20 percent more of a key 
precursor of acid rain than it produced last year this allowance 
would be in the form of credits for the achievements of us 
control progams in place since 1975 which have reduced nitrogen 
oxide emissions 85 percent since the peak year of 1978 
canada had agreed to a draft that would have permitted increases 
in us nitrogen oxide emissions as long as they did not result in 
increases of the pollutant moving into canada said sheldon meyers 
acting associate administrator of the environmental protection 
agency for international programs 
meyers said the united states told canada it did not believe 
northbound flows of nitrogen oxides could even be measured and 
theres no way we could agree to such a provision in light of 
projected increases in us emissions 
although most attention has been focused on sulfur oxides 
emitted by coalburning power plants and other sources nitrogen 
oxides emitted by those plants by motor vehicles and by other 
sources are believed to generate a third of the extra acidity of 
acid rain in the eastern united states and canada 
the reagan administration has generally adopted the line that 
more research is needed northeastern states which like canada 
have noticed damage to their forests and lakes have sided with 
their northern neighbor in calling for tough limits on pollutants 
from coalburning plants and other sources of acidcausing 
emissions 
maine new hampshire vermont connecticut massachusetts new 
york pennsylvania and new jersey are suing the environmental 
protection agency seeking new emission controls similar to those 
sought by canada

former investment banker arthur k 
salomon was sentenced today to 1 to 4 years in prison for 
shooting a teenager after a dispute on a highway 
salomon told the court that last june 19 the day he shot 
gianluca cotugno was a day id like to forget as much as the 
cotugno family he said he had been under a lot of stress due to 
the death of children of family friends 
i dont expect the cotugno family to ever forgive me said 
salomon 53 of pound ridge and manhattan 
under a plea bargaining agreement salomon had pleaded guilty to 
assault for the shooting off the hutchinson river parkway 
state supreme court justice nicholas colabella who had 
originally indicated he would sentence salomon to two to six years 
said he had received numerous letters describing him as an good 
and decent person 
he also said it was lucky that the bullet had missed vital 
organs and that the young man was still alive 
salomon is the grandson of one of the founders of the salomon 
brothers investment firm he was surrounded in court by family 
members including his wife lisa and son tony 
according to authorities salomon and cotugno 19 were both 
driving south in the left lane cotugno tried to pass but salomon 
refused to pull his mercedes into the right lane 
cotugno of larchmont exited in scarsdale and salomon pulled 
onto a grassy knoll then saw cotugno get out of his car with his 
hands waving he said

swearing but that as he approached the car he saw salomon 
pointing a gun at him took down the license plate number and told 
salomon he was going to notify police 
salomon placed the car in gear started it toward mr cotugno 
and shot mr cotugno once in the chest said bolen adding that 
he wanted the remarks to set the record straight as to what the 
prosecution believed happened 
neither cotugno nor family members were in court but the family 
lawyer stephen heard said the youths 20 million civil suit 
against salomon would proceed in state supreme court in manhattan 
with a conference next month

an army inquiry said today that a jewish guard 
accidentally shot and killed a teenage settler during a stoning 
attack by palestinians on the occupied west bank 
but the report blamed arab residents of beita for the april 6 
confrontation in which two palestinians and the young jewish woman 
were killed and the guard was seriously wounded 
a senior military spokesman told reporters that villagers had 
been planning to attack jewish settlers for days before the 
clash with the jewish hikers in beita 
the confrontation stirred strong emotions in israel it pitted 
jewish settlers against the army after leaks from the military 
investigation said 15yearold tirza porat was killed with the 
guards gun 
it came as the israelis have been trying to put down a 
palestinian uprising against their occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip territories they seized in the 1967 middle east war 
since dec 8 israeli soldiers have killed 174 arabs and one other 
israeli has been killed 
todays report criticized hike organizers saying they were 
negligent in failing to coordinate their activities with the army 
it also said the wounded guard 26yearold romam aldubi showed 
negligence in operating the weapons ignoring common sense 
precautions and overhastiness in pulling the trigger 
the military spokesman col raanan gissin said aldubi had been 
hasty in opening fire at villagers who threw rocks at the 
hikers while they walked through a valley near the village 
the way in which aldubi used his arms throughout this 
incident there was clearly negligence and perhaps violation of 
safety precautions gissin said 
the wounded guard was in critical condition at jerusalems 
hadassah hospital 
the first reports said the girl was shot to death later 
reports had indicated that arabs killed the teenager with a rock 
after attacking the 16 teenage hikers and their two adult guards 
near beita 
despite the army leak jewish settlers have maintained the 
teenager was shot by a villager using a sovietdesigned 
kalashnikov rifle 
the report disagreed porat was shot by aldubis gun 
apparently after he reacted instinctively to the rock thrown at his 
head

jesse jackson has been saying michael dukakis has 
picked up some of his issues but im the real thing now 
jackson with nomination hopes dimming is pressuring the 
democratic frontrunner to adopt even more of his positions 
in speeches debates and interviews jackson seems to be 
shifting his focus from winning the 1988 democratic presidential 
nomination to trying to shape the partys platform and moving 
dukakis to the left on spending issues in that way he still could 
affect the policies of a dukakis administration should the 
democrats win in november 
but dukakis has not been moved by jacksons prodding on such 
issues as doubling federal spending on education allocating 3 
billion in new money to head start and laying down a complete 
federal budget outline 
hes doing his thing and im doing my thing dukakis said in 
langhorne pa on monday 
the massachusetts governor has simply stuck to his own call for 
new education initiatives some without price tags and his general 
support for other social service programs and he says he hasnt 
adopted jacksons positions 
these are issues that have been of great concern to me all 
during my political career dukakis said wednesday adding that 
he and jackson share more than issues we share a lot of the same 
goals and values we disagree on some things too but weve always 
done that in a friendly way 
jackson has been careful to keep the focus on the issues and not 
to criticize dukakis personally 
as i seek to make this world better to bring jobs at home and 
justice and peace in the world were going to show the difference 
between politics as usual and politics of change jackson said 
wednesday the debate will show differences but not division 
in cincinnati on tuesday jackson said dukakis had followed his 
lead on a number of issues 
for example he said people have told me that dukakis is 
going into the schools now talking about drugs well that just 
ratifies my leadership people say youre talking about the same 
things whats the difference well its butter or margarine im 
the real thing 
jackson laid down the challenge to dukakis to adopt more of his 
positions in a pair of pennsylvania debates before tuesdays 
primary 
ive put the numbers together to pay for my dreams jackson 
told dukakis on saturday night in mundall pa i commit myself 
to doubling the education budget its the best investment i 
want to add 3 billion to head start and the war on drugs 
its going to cost 
when dukakis replied without giving specific dollar figures 
jackson chided him that is not a commitment to add to head 
start 
and on day care and housing jackson has said he has specific 
plans and dukakis does not 
jackson also pressed dukakis to toughen his stance against south 
africa suggesting that that countrys government be designated a 
terrorist regime dukakis promises tough action against south 
africa but he would not adopt jacksons stance 
the massachusetts governor said later during the weekend that 
jacksons call for him to put out a proposed federal budget is 
absurd 
one thing i have learned very painfully is that you cant be 
drawing up budgets today for next year no candidate knows exactly 
what youre going to confront dukakis said 
referring to his first year as governor when he had to renege 
on campaign promises on the state budget he was emphatic i had 
to eat an awful lot of crow and im never going to make that 
mistake again 
dukakis said he would continue to talk about the specific 
spending measures he wants to discuss 
ill lay out where im going to make the cuts ive done that 
in great detail ill lay out where i think we ought to do some 
investing ive done that in great detail he said on sunday 
dukakis issues adviser tom herman says pointedly jackson has 
not put out a budget either

with a little help from interpol a roman 
statue displayed here is going back to the french museum from which 
it was stolen in 1914 
the bronze a sixinch statue of hypnos the god of sleep was 
given to the st louis art museum in 1953 
the museums board of commissioners voted tuesday to give it 
back to the musee des beaux arts et darcheologie in besancon 
france 
french police may come to st louis this summer to claim the 
statue one of six bronze objects stolen in 1914 a french museum 
official said 
the statue was given to the st louis art museum by the late j 
lionberger davis a lawyer art collector and museum patron said 
james burke museum director 
burke said the statue was neither a particularly valuable nor 
important work and was worth no more than 5000 he said the 
statue has not been displayed at the museum for at least 20 years 
the statues ownership came into question as it was about to be 
auctioned at sothebys in new york last year a few days before the 
auction two scholars who had seen the statue in a catalog 
questioned its authenticity and suggested that it might be a copy 
of the missing besancon bronze burke said 
a day before the auction interpol the international police 
force notified sothebys that the statue was believed to be the 
stolen bronze itself and the statue was withdrawn from the sale 
the authenticity of the statue was determined when a plaster 
cast made from a 160yearold mold of the besancon bronze was 
compared to the statue in the st louis collection the plaster 
cast and the st louis bronze were identical down to a crack in 
the left arm and scratch marks on the buttocks burke said 
sidney m goldstein associate director of the st louis museum 
said he had no reason to believe that either davis or his dealer 
had known that the object had been stolen he said he had planned 
to take the statue to the besancon museum himself as a gesture of 
good will but a french museum official said the statue must be 
turned over to the french police

here are some basic points in the disagreement 
between the united states and canada over acid rain 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what is acid rain 
although rain is naturally somewhat acidic acid rain refers 
to the additional acidity added by pollutants sulfuric acid 
formed from coalburning power plant and factory emissions and 
nitric acid from power plant factory and motor vehicle emissions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
why is it important 
environmentalists say in eastern north america the extra acid 
is killing fish and other aquatic life in lakes and streams also 
they say it corrodes buildings bridges and monuments adds to 
stress on declining forests and in the form of acidic haze 
reduces visibility and threatens health 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what can be done 
new coalfired power plants already must meet strict emissions 
standards but few are being built these days its the large 
plants in the us midwest built generally in the 1950s through the 
mid1970s that people are concerned about especially since they 
are lasting longer than most people figured 
new coal plants generally use scrubbers to remove the acid 
in the smokestack although 146 scrubbers are in service fitting 
them to old plants would be expensive several estimates say 5 
billion a year 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
why hasnt something been done 
in part because the reagan administration and congressional 
delegations from heavy coalproducing states maintain that more 
research should be done first they say not enough is known about 
the scale of the damages to justify such massive expense 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
why is canada concerned 
half the acid rain that falls in canada originates in sulfur 
dioxide emitted by us sources 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what does canada want 
canada us states in the northeast and environmentalists have 
pressed for a roughly 50 percent cut in sulfur dioxide emissions 
various bills in congress to accomplish this have failed 
most recently canada proposed a treaty that would commit the 
united states to a 44 percent reduction in the northbound flow of 
sulfur dioxide 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what about canadian emissions 
canada contributes minor amounts to us acid rain perhaps 25 
percent because of wind patterns in the adirondack mountains of 
new york state canada has embarked on a program aimed at cutting 
its own sulfur dioxide emissions 50 percent by 1994

president reagan today described as totally 
inaccurate a published report that some of his close friends and 
advisers have mounted a campaign to force attorney general edwin 
meese iii from office 
asked about the report in the wall street journal which said 
that first lady nancy reagan supports the effort to oust meese 
reagan said 
i shouldnt answer the question but i have to tell you no 
im not aware of such a move 
during a picturetaking session in the oval office with visiting 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney reagan reacted heatedly to 
the journal report the story was totally inaccurate he said 
asked what circumstances might prompt him to get rid of meese 
the president replied well if he had a complete change of 
character 
the journal story in todays editions said that in addition to 
working for meeses ouster some white house officials have sounded 
out former defense secretary caspar weinberger as a possible 
successor to meese 
weiberger asked today about the possibility of taking over as 
attorney general said i think we have a good attorney 
general interviewed briefly in orlando fla weinberger said he 
had no desire for more government service 
while reagan repeatedly has indicated his support for meese the 
dumpmeese effort has just gone underground the newspaper 
quoted one unidentified white house official as saying 
reagan insiders including weinberger and longtime campaign 
consultant stuart spencer are convinced that ethical questions 
plaguing meese are threatening the republican party and damaging 
the justice department the newspaper said 
a spokesman for white house chief of staff howard baker was 
quoted as saying he denies any knowledge of any such effort to 
oust meese 
the advisers want to present reagan with a completed quickexit 
package similar to one that forced out former chief of staff 
donald regan the newspaper said 
under this plan meese would quit and be quickly replaced by 
someone with recognized stature and abilities so far a 
replacement hasnt been found the newspaper said 
aides to vice president george bush last week said meeses 
troubles have become a political liability to bush who now has 
enough committed delegates to secure the republican presidential 
nomination 
the aides who requested anonymity said bush would be relieved 
if meese resigned but has found it difficult to speak out on the 
matter 
bush and baker were both present last week when two resigned 
meese aides laid out their case against the attorney general to the 
president 
asked to comment on mrs reagans reported role in the meese 
ouster campaign elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary 
said she hasnt been making any telephone calls she hasnt been 
getting any telephone calls shes not involved in it 
mrs reagan who was believed to be instrumental in regans 
ouster also knows that meese has to go the newspaper said 
quoting a person familiar with the first ladys views 
asked about this mrs crispen replied its very difficult 
for me to respond to these ghost quotes i dont know if this 
person has talked to the first lady in the past year i do know 
that she hasnt been involved in any campaign to oust the 
attorney general

by the time they reach middle age americans 
born today could be sharing the planet with twice the current 
number of people a private population research group reported 
wednesday 
the worlds population which edged past the 5 billion mark just 
a year ago could double within 40 years the population reference 
bureau said in its annual world population data sheet 
weve been noticing for a couple of years now that the overall 
growth trend has not been following the standard projections 
carl haub an analyst for the bureau said in a telephone interview 
the anticipated decline in birth rates in many lessdeveloped 
nations has not been as great as hoped he said and it is likely 
that the sixth billion person will be added in just 10 more 
years 
while projecting the worlds population into the future requires 
assumptions about birth rates haub noted that the global 
population has been rising faster than previously anticipated 
it took all of human history to raise the worlds population to 
1 billion which occurred in the early 1800s during the 
presidency of thomas jefferson 
more than a century was required to add the second billion 
which occurred about 1930 according to the united nations fund for 
population activities the population rose to 3 billion by 1964 4 
billion in 1974 and 5 billion in 1987 
the next billion could be added by 1998 said haub 
there is a perception that world population growth is a problem 
of the 1970s haub observed so we thought it was time to point 
out that its still growing faster than had been projected 
the bureaus data sheet shows worldwide population growing at 
17 percent annually the united nations had projected growth of 
16 percent 
that doesnt sound like much haub said but in a world of 5 
billion inhabitants the difference represents 5 million more 
people per year 
population growth hasnt followed the smooth trend downward that 
had been expected in many deceloping nations haub said he noted 
in particular that china india pakistan and iran have high growth 
rates 
some of the larger countries have not followed a nice smooth 
path to the twochild family that we have been predicting said 
haub he pointed in particular to china and india where previous 
reductions in births have not been maintained 
the doubling of the world population in 40 years depends on 
growth continuing at 17 percent a rate that varies considerably 
from country to country and region to region haub said 
the more developed nations for example are growing at 06 
percent annually for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years 
the data sheet shows on the other hand the lessdeveloped nations 
could double in just 33 years at a growth rate of 21 percent 
increasing fastest are kenya and the disputed territory of gaza 
currently occupied by israel each of which is expected to double 
its population in just 17 years at current rates of increase 
at the other end of the scale five countries are not growing at 
all austria denmark hungary east germany and west germany and 
italy at its current rate would not double its population for 
3465 years 
changes are hard to anticipate as various nations progress 
economically toward what population experts call the demographic 
transition 
in early societies high birth rates are generally balanced by 
high death rates as economic conditions provide better medical 
care and nutrition death rates fall while birth rates remain high 
leading to rapid population growth 
eventually history shows birth rates also begin to fall in a 
transition to balance again as has happened in many more developed 
nations 
social religions and other differences among nations however 
keep this change from being a smooth curve and help lead to the 
many variations around the world

praise from the sierra club was cut from a 
television campaign commercial for sen pete wilson after the 
environmental group said the message falsely indicated it had 
endorsed the incumbent republican 
the television ad seen in the montereysalinas area during a 
weeklong test run quotes a 1984 letter from the club to wilson 
thanking him for supporting legislation that added 17 million 
acres to state wilderness land 
the commercial says wilson fought developers when they 
threatened the natural beauty of san diego where wilson was mayor 
during the 1970s he cites his opposition to offshore oil drilling 
proposals favored by the reagan administration and mentions his 
support of the 1984 wilderness bill 
the commercial ends with the words for the wilderness bill 
wrote the sierra club of america thank you senator wilson 
sierra club officials said tuesday they object to the use of 
their name in political ads by candidates they have not endorsed 
its the sort of thing where people arent always listening 
that closely to commercials and they hear sierra club and 
mistake it for an endorsement said joanne hurley the clubs 
national public affairs director 
the environmental group has yet to endorse either wilson who is 
seeking a second term or his democratic challenger lt gov leo 
mccarthy 
otto bos wilsons campaign manager said tuesday the offending 
language will be removed from the commercial but bos said wilson 
was angered by the clubs reaction to the commercial 
we felt we were justified in showcasing a letter that was 
freely sent bos said 
relations between wilson and the club have become strained in 
recent weeks over a bill pending in congress that would grant 
wilderness status to more than 9 million acres of california desert 
land the club strongly supports the bill but wilson has expressed 
reservations

pink floyd drummer nick mason says some 
scathing remarks by the groups erstwhile bassist and singer roger 
waters revived the 20yearold rock band and acted as a catalyst 
for their current platinum album 
roger was right when he said the band was creatively dead at 
the point at which he left mason said it was just that when 
he had gone we thought oh why not have another crack at it can 
we do anything about it or not when we started the album we made 
sure we werent committed to anything until we had done enough work 
to say it works or we think it works lets carry on 
the result was a momentary lapse of reason a 
millionselling lp that has produced the hits learning to fly 
and on the turning away 
mason 44 said a legal settlement of the groups differences 
with waters is near but a musical reconciliation is not waters 
left pink floyd to pursue a solo career because of differences in 
the making of the 1983 album the final cut

the house today voted approval of two 
democraticbacked arms control restrictions despite strong 
opposition by president reagan 
the chamber split generally along party lines as it passed 
252159 a ban on any star wars tests that would violate the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
later it voted 240174 to bar spending for any weapons that 
would violate the numerical limits on various categories of atomic 
weapons contained in the 1979 salt ii treaty reagan says the 
soviets are violating the unratified pact and thus he will no 
longer follow it when deciding which us weapons to build 
the votes came as the democraticcontrolled chamber began 
working on a huge bill authorizing the pentagon budget for the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 
in effect the first vote requires reagan to adhere to the 
socalled narrow interpretation of the abm pact even though the 
president asserts he has the legal right to move to a broad view 
that would allow expanded star wars testing 
this is unilateral disarmament of a benign but nonethless 
serious sort said rep henry hyde rill a critic of the abm 
restricton 
but rep john spratt dsc said what were talking about 
is simply the same intepretation of the abm treaty thats been 
taken by every president since it was ratified 
both amendments were added to last years pentagon budget bill 
on votes which went largely along party lines but they were later 
altered during the housesenate conference committee called to work 
out differences between the defense bills passed separately by the 
two chambers 
the abm fight arises from reagans contention that he can 
unilaterally change how a treaty is legally interpreted by the 
united states although reagan has asserted such a right legally 
exists he has chosen not to exercise it 
congressional democrats dispute reagans assertion arguing that 
a treaty cannot be changed without approval of the senate which 
must ratify such pacts before they become effective 
the fight has spilled over to the ratification of the separate 
ussoviet treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear forces 
the senate foreign relations committee on a 127 decision that 
generally went along party lines added an amendment banning the 
inf treaty from being reinterpreted unless the senate approves 
that amendment is expected to be the subject of a major fight when 
the senate considers ratification next month 
the arms control fights are the first of a series of debates 
that will stretch into next month as the house considers a bill 
authorizing the budget of the largest single agency in government 
the measure proposes to let the pentagon spend 2995 billion in 
the next fiscal year which is slightly less than the 300 billion 
authorized in the current budget 
the 2995 billion figure was set last december as part of the 
socalled budget summit between reagan and congressional 
leaders the overall spending package is designed to reduce federal 
budget deficits 
the defense figure was 33 billion less than the reagan 
administration thought it would receive for the pentagon next year 
and defense secretary frank carlucci ordered the services to make 
major budget cuts to meet the lower figure among the reductions 
were the early retirement of some smaller navy ships along with 
reductions in civilian employment by some of the services 
the bill that passes the house will eventually go to a 
housesenate conference committee to be reconciled with the measure 
that the senate will approve 
the senate is proceeding at a slower pace with its armed 
services committee meeting behind closed doors this week to write 
its version of the bill 
one major difference is the spending level for the strategic 
defense initiative as star wars is formally known 
reagan sought 48 billion for sdi next year compared with the 
current 39 billion budget the house measure proposes 40 
billion although that figure could be changed when the issue is 
debated next week the senate armed services committee is 
considering 46 billion

president roh taewoo on wednesday 
appealed for a spirit of negotiation after elections in which his 
party lost its legislative majority to a divided opposition 
strong provincial bases helped the opposition leaders of all 
parties expressed fear of regional conflicts in the 299member 
national assembly where rohs democratic justice party won 125 
seats and three opposition parties have a total of 164 
antigovernment groups had held sometimes violent protests 
before tuesdays elections claiming the government rigged them 
when the government lost they canceled demonstrations scheduled 
for wednesday 
the composite index of shares on the seoul stock market plunged 
a record 2458 points wednesday to 6201 the previous record was 
2169 on feb 26 
we can foresee many difficulties in the future because of the 
fact that the ruling party was not able to win a simple majority in 
the national assembly roh said 
after noting that the new constitution strengthened the 
legislatures powers he said political maturity and a 
willingness to engage in dialogue and negotiation have become even 
more important if the administration and the ruling party are to 
carry out their policies smoothly without a national assembly 
majority 
i will humbly accept the will of the people as reflected in 
the election and will do the best i can to duly carry out the 
administrations policies roh said 
he has pledged to continue democratic reforms begun after huge 
antigovernment protests last summer 
kim daejung leader of the main opposition party for peace and 
democracy promised cooperation if the government pursues reform 
and pledged his help in making a success of the 1988 olympics 
which begin sept 17 in seoul 
many divisive political matters are expected to wait until after 
the games opposition leaders said however they would press for 
more investigations of alleged corruption under chun doohwan 
rohs predecessor and for release of the more than 1000 prisoners 
they say still are held for political reasons 
opposition leaders reminded roh of the campaign pledge he made 
last year to seek a public evaluation of his performance after the 
olympics he has not said how he would do it 
roh won the presidency in december with 366 percent of the vote 
because opposition support was split between kim daejung and rival 
opposition candidate kim youngsam 
in tuesdays elections kim daejungs party won 70 seats and 
kim youngsams reunification democratic party got 59 thirtyfive 
seats and the potential swing vote went to the new democratic 
republic party of kim jongpil a conservative former prime 
minister 
independents and small parties won 10 seats 
many observers had expected tuesday to be a repeat of the 
december election in many districts where one government party 
candidate faced two or more from the opposition 
with new singlemember election districts however the 
government party was nearly shut out in some strongholds of 
opposition parties under the former system of sending two 
delegates to the national assembly from each district second place 
won a seat 
analysts in the south korean press said many voters shunned the 
government party because of a perception of corruption and pressure 
tactics in the campaign 
on the day before the election prosecutors reported finding 
thousands of envelopes ready for mailing each stuffed with 20000 
won 27 and leaflets for a government candidate the party 
expelled him 
there were violent protests when a television station broadcast 
a report monday of victory by a government candidate the station 
apologized saying it was a technical error during a coverage 
rehearsal 
protesters called it evidence that the government was 
manipulating votecounting computers the candidate lost 
roh said of the strong performances by parties in traditional 
regional bases in a divided nation the fact that regional 
schisms have become so deep is alarming to all of us 
divided nation was a reference to the peninsulas division 
for four decades into communist north korea and the capitalist 
south 
kim daejung said it was painful for the divided south to be 
further fragmented into east and west 
the reagan administration praised the elections with state 
department spokesman charles redman saying they showed that 
democracy in south korea is alive and well and getting stronger 
every day

the chief lobbyist for the national rifle 
association today gave a qualified endorsement to compromise 
legislation setting a minimum metallic standard for socalled 
plastic guns 
our opinion is its not a bad bill said the nras james j 
baker he said the nras position from the beginning was to ensure 
that legislation did not ban currently possessed firearms and did 
not ban firearms currently being imported into this country the 
compromise achieves those goals he said 
as long as were not banning any handguns i dont have 
serious problems said the nra lobbyist 
the compromise requires that guns contain material that would be 
as detectable by metal detectors as 37 ounces of stainless steel 
the gun could have less metal or a different kind of metal as long 
as it would be as detectable as the stainlesssteel standard 
baker said that i support it the compromise in principle 
but he said he had reservations about some details 
there still needs to be some minor tinkering he said 
adding that the nra was offering a qualified endorsement of the 
compromise 
police organizations and guncontrol advocates have insisted 
that a minimum amount of metal be required in a gun to ensure 
detection by the magnetometers used in airport and building 
security systems 
the nra has insisted that there should be no 
governmentestablished metal standard only a general requirement 
that any gun be detectable by existing equipment 
the compromise takes the law enforcement approach and sets a 
minimum metallic standard 
although differences over plastic gun legislation have triggered 
a new and ferocious guncontrol fight in congress sponsors of 
rival bills said tuesdays breakthrough could be a unifying force 
for lawmakers on all sides 
joseph a morris director of the justice departments office of 
liaison confirmed the agreement and said he hoped everyone can 
claim victory 
despite these optimistic comments however the general approach 
adopted in the compromise has been attacked bitterly in past nra 
statements as an attempt to take guns from lawabiding citizens 
attorney general edwin meese iii who at first publicly backed 
the nras legislative position now is committed to the compromise 
morris said 
the differences in the rival bills have never been 
insurmountable but they became magnified once the plastic gun 
issue became the vehicle for the latest debate over whether the 
government should control handguns 
almost lost in the bitter struggle was the fact that everyone 
embroiled in the dispute expressed the same goal making sure 
potential terrorist weapons of the future will never be smuggled 
onto airplanes or buildings with security requirements plastic 
guns are not yet in production in this country but there is 
general agreement the technology exists 
the gun control and police groups have argued that the nra 
approach would cause long delays in airports they contended that 
without a minimum metal requirement for the gun magnetometers must 
be used at settings so sensitive that they would constantly trigger 
alarms 
the nra has said that the minimum standards established in 
legislation would have banned a number of small metal handguns now 
manufactured and called one particular measure the first federal 
gun ban bill in america 
in a fundraising letter to its supporters just this month the 
nra said that bills with minimum metallic standards would grant 
unlimited power to government bureaucrats to ban millions more of 
your guns 
however those comments addressed bills with higher metal 
requirements than the compromise between the administration and a 
coalition of 11 police groups the law enforcement steering 
committee 
morris said no currently made gun would be banned under the 
compromise language the key provision would require that guns have 
enough metal to trigger an alarm set to pick up 37 ounces of 
stainless steel 
the nra has supported a bill by sen jim mcclure ridaho which 
would ban undetectable plastic weapons without setting a minimum 
standard mcclures approach however says that weapons must be 
detectable by existing magnetometers 
mcclure commenting on the compromise said he believes the 
proposal brings all sides closer together although he stopped 
short of an endorsement 
but he added that if it would not ban any existing guns there 
would be little substantive difference between the two measures 
what we were trying to make certain of is that this is a 
detection bill and not a confiscation bill mcclure said

inability to control urinary function puts 
millions of elderly americans into nursing homes even though 
virtually all such patients can be helped with new medical 
techniques a researcher says 
help is available and more help is on the way for 
incontinence one of the most common and difficult problems for 
aged americans said dr alan j wein professor of urology at the 
university of pennsylvania hospital 
speaking at a seminar sponsored this week by the national kidney 
foundation wein said half of the people in nursing homes are 
unable to control their urine flow and many people are placed in 
the homes simply because they are incontintent 
a recent estimate of direct and indirect cost of just 
incontinence in the elderly exceeds 8 billion a year he said 
a spokeswoman for the american health care association which 
represents the forprofit nursing home industry said recent 
studies actually show that more than half 55 percent of all 
nursing home residents are incontinent 
linda keegan the spokeswoman however said the average nursing 
home resident has four problems that are limitations to daily 
living 
incontinence may be the final factor to force the family to 
put a person into a nursing home ms keegan said many families 
cope successfully with problems such as feeding bathing and 
dressing an elderly relative she said but when incontinence is 
added it may make it impossible to handle them at home 
incontinence is a problem for a large number of people both in 
and out of nursing homes wein said 
he said there are estimates that 1 percent to 2 percent of men 
and 5 percent to 10 percent of women under age 65 suffer from the 
problem among older americans the estimates are 6 percent for men 
and 12 percent for women and for many he said incontinence is 
devastating 
they have to quit their jobs restrict their activities and 
stay at home to avoid embarrassment he said 
only about one in five adults with urinary control problems seek 
medical help wein said and many who do are told by uninformed 
physicians that nothing can be done 
many doctors regard incontinence as an inevitable consequence 
of age he said but it is not virtually all forms of 
incontinence are treatable 
incontinence is such a widespread problem that the sale of 
absorbent undergarments a type of adult diaper has become a 
billiondollar industry that uses national television ads as a 
marketing tool he said 
the fact that urine collection is a billiondollar industry is 
a sad commentary because there now are innovative and successful 
medical treatments to correct or improve the control of urinary 
function wein said 
sophisticated new measuring techniques now can determine the 
precise cause of incontinence and this enables specialists to 
apply a wide range of treatment techniques he said 
wein said these include 
scheduling simply voiding on a set timed pattern can solve 
some cases 
biofeedback this technique trains patients to use muscles to 
help strengthen the uninary sphincter a muscle that acts like a 
valve to control the flow 
drugs medication to increase sphincter resistance and to 
decrease bladder contractility have become extraordinarily 
effective 
electrical stimulation this system is under active study now 
to improve the function of both the bladder and the urinary 
sphincter 
surgery although considered a last resort surgical techniques 
have improved significantly in recent years as a result of more 
precise diagnosis ninty percent of women with stress 
incontinence an involuntary leakage while coughing sneezing or 
exercising are cured with surgery improved techniques also are 
solving most of the problems men have with urinary function as a 
result of an enlarged prostate wein said 
use of an artificial urinary sphincter when used appropriately 
is successful in 80 percent to 90 percent of the cases wein said

the state department entrusted millions of 
dollars in travelers checks to poorly paid clerks who kept them in 
unlocked cabinets and in stacks on the floor resulting in an 
operation so loose that 59000 was embezzled and 307780 has 
disappeared congress was told wednesday 
congressional investigators also told a house government 
operations subcommittee that controls on state department travel 
advances were so disorganized that 15 million in such payments are 
delinquent 
that total includes a 695 advance to fired white house aide lt 
col oliver l north which is four years overdue 
one committee member called the situation rotten ineptitude 
other officials said the state departments focus on foreign policy 
issues at the expense of management operations was to blame 
some of the names and social security numbers on the 
travelexpense accounts appear to have been replaced with 
fictitious names and social security numbers the investigators 
said 
one delinquent traveler is recorded as ludwig van beethoven 
the investigators said 
it seems to me the perpetrators even had a sense of humor in 
conducting what amounted to criminal activity said rep john 
conyers dmich 
sherman n funk the state departments inspector general said 
the travelers check problem was uncovered after a surprise audit 
last aug 21 of the departments principal cashier operations in 
its headquarters building here 
this audit was conducted as the result of an employee 
embezzling and cashing 59000 in travelers checks during the nine 
days she worked in the cashier operation funk said 
we found that an additional 307780 in blank travelers checks 
is missing but not yet cashed he said 
funk testified that the departments principal cashier oversees 
a constantly replenished 250000 cash fund and an average 3 
million in travelers checks it annually disburses about 625000 
in cash and 227 million in travelers checks 
but ronald spiers undersecretary of state for management said 
cashiers are typically gs3s one of the lowest federal job 
grades and are poorly paid making less than they could earn 
working in a gasoline station 
spiers said he had not been aware of the problem until reading 
the inspector generals and general accounting office reports he 
said that because the department is focused on foreign policy 
issues management issues do not get the attention they deserve 
funk added i would like to emphasize that in our opinion 
the most critical of all of the deficiencies noted was the 
departments lack of concern with administrative support 
the inspector generals formal report a copy of which was made 
available to the associated press said inspectors found there was 
no inventory of travelers checks no written operating procedures 
no controlled custody of funds minimal physical security in the 
cashiers office and improperly trained and supervised personnel 
the cashiers operation was so disorganized that state 
department records could not be used to determine how much money 
had been embezzled the report said instead investigators had to 
rely on the records of citicorp the issuer of the checks 
on aug 21 we observed travelers checks stored in an unlocked 
supply cabinet and on the floor in the cashiers office the 
report said all of the boxes of travelers checks 20 or more 
boxes had been opened and checks had been issued randomly out of 
the boxes rather than a firstin firstout system for issuance 
investigators have not been able to learn if the 307000 in 
missing travelers checks were embezzled misplaced or accidentally 
or intentionally destroyed the report said 
but it said that because the missing travelers checks are 
negotiable the state department remains liable for the missing 
amounts until the checks are accounted for 
some accountable department officers never knew that travelers 
checks had almost the same vulnerability as cash the report said 
frank conahan an assistant us comptroller general said a 
general accounting office investigation showed the delinquent 
travel advance situation is worse than it was two years ago when 
the department promised to correct it 
the number of overdue or delinquent accounts rose from 8100 in 
1985 to 19800 in 1987 with 300 accounts in excess of 10000 and 
two totaling 34000 each conahan said 
he said the total value of delinquent accounts rose from 10 
million in 1985 to about 154 million last year 
in testimony before the subcommittee in october 1985 the 
state department admitted that its travel operations were a mess 
and promised prompt corrective behavior said rep jack brooks 
dtexas the subcommittee chairman 
today we see the same rotten ineptitude he added

irancontra prosecutors have been unable to 
obtain marine lt col oliver l norths secret notebooks since 
learning about their whereabouts from norths former secretary 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said wednesday 
walsh testifying at a pretrial hearing in the irancontra 
conspiracy case said former national security council secretary 
fawn hall reported seeing the notebooks in the office of norths 
attorney brendan v sullivan jr 
fawn hall had seen the notebooks in your office and we were 
trying to get you to admit that you had them or that colonel north 
had them walsh said under questioning by sullivan 
we subpoenaed you and tried to get the information you 
resisted walsh said 
ms hall who was norths secretary at the nsc is cooperating 
with walshs investigation of the irancontra affair under a grant 
of immunity from prosecution 
she is listed as a prospective trial witness against north 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord no date has been set for the trial 
walsh did not explain why his office was unable to obtain the 
diaries 
norths nearly 3000 pages of diary entries are the subject of a 
fresh subpoena issued this week by the senate foreign relations 
committee to assist a subcommittee probe of alleged drug 
trafficking and money laundering 
subcommittee chairman john kerry dmass has said the 
possibility exists that the contra rebels profited from the drug 
trade to finance the purchase of arms and supplies 
the legal fight between walsh and sullivan is under court seal 
because it relates to the grand jury investigation but it is 
presumed that sullivan successfully invoked attorneyclient 
privilege in refusing to answer questions about the documents 
whereabouts 
walsh said his office had tried to determine if north had 
possession of the documents so we could subpoena them 
prosecutors then learned from fawn hall that the notebooks were in 
sullivans office walsh said 
the congressional committees that investigated the irancontra 
affair were given censored versions of 1269 pages of the 2848 
pages of norths diaries 
seventyfour heavily censored pages were released tuesday by 
kerry they were sprinkled with references to drugs the drug 
enforcement administration and the cia panamanian strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega who is under us indictment on drug 
charges was also mentioned

gravel bank below 
brig gen saifullah the kabul police commander blamed moslem 
guerrillas based in pakistan who have been fighting since the 
communist coup 
speaking to foreign journalists seven hours after the blast the 
police commander displayed what he described as a pakistani license 
plate from the truck 
the address of the driver of the truck and the owner of the 
truck have been found out he said they are afghan nationals 
he said no arrests had been made and the investigation was 
continuing

western sources said earlier this week they counted 22 bombs in 
kabul in march alone and 10 in february 
according to saifullah the years bombings killed about 35 
people and wounded five or 10 that reverses the usual death and 
injury ratio in bombings 
the western sources speaking privately said car bombings had 
increased in kabul while the number of rocket attacks by guerrillas 
was declining 
attacks did not slacken after the signing april 14 in geneva of 
an accord under which the soviet union will begin withdrawing its 
estimated 115000 soldiers from afghanistan by may 15 the sources 
said 
security in kabul was tightened this week because of 
preparations for the soviet withdrawal and celebrations of the coup 
april 27 1978 in which president mohammad daoud was killed and a 
government backed by the kremlin was installed soviet troops 
entered the country in december 1979 
police checkpoints stopped cars tuesday when a military parade 
was held to inspect trunks and glove compartments and check 
undercarriages but such precautions were less frequent wednesday

democrats chose former philadelphia 
controller joseph vignola to challenge twoterm republican sen 
john heinz and picked a backer of political extremist lyndon 
larouche in a us house primary 
the results of tuesdays primary in suburban philadelphias 5th 
congressional district left democrats embarrassed and the stunned 
loser declared wednesday that people better wake up 
the larouche follower drexel hill sales representative donald 
hadley edged businessman robert w houchins in a contest to 
determine which would challenge gop rep richard schulze in 
november 
houchins said wednesday that voters were not paying attention 
i feel some of the people in the party did not take donald 
hadley seriously enough the larouche threat is very real he 
said 
most voters houchins said dont care about what happens in 
this country charles manson could run for office and get elected 
former district justice mitchell g crane of west chester said 
hadleys victory shows the weakness of the democratic 
organization in the three counties it is a disgrace 
larouche is a presidential candidate who promulgates bizarre 
theories including support for quarantining aids victims and 
charging that the queen of england is a drug dealer 
with 99 percent of the votes counted hadley had 10667 or 53 
percent and houchins 9298 or 47 percent 
in the statewide senate primary vignola did not win by as wide 
a margin as had been expected endorsed by the democratic state 
committee he raised some 200000 to 5000 for opponent susan 
sullivan kefover a twoterm commissioner in rural potter county 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting vignola had 490079 
votes or 45 percent kefover had 371722 or 34 percent steven 
douglas of suburban philadelphia another follower of larouche had 
146050 votes or 13 percent and had 74843 votes or 7 percent and 
villanova university professor john logue had 74843 votes or 7 
percent 
lowman henry field director of the republican state committee 
said vignolas modest showing foreshadowed a big victory for heinz 
when an unendorsed county commissioner can get that many 
votes it shows that he vignola is not well known were looking 
for john heinz to be a big boost to the republican ticket 
pennsylvania voters also overwhelmingly approved a ballot 
question that will clear a 300 million bond issue to underwrite a 
program cleaning up the states water and sewer systems 
pennsylvania has been leading the nation recently in outbreaks of 
waterborne diseases

the ptl has asked a federal claims court in 
washington to review a decision by the internal revenue service to 
revoke its taxexempt status a spokesman said wednesday 
david west ptl spokesman said the appeal delays an irs 
decision last week that lifted the troubled television ministrys 
taxfree status making contributions no longer tax deductible 
until the review is completed donations of up to 1000 may be 
claimed as federal income tax deductions west said in a telephone 
interview from heritage usa the ministrys theme park in fort 
mill sc 
anyone who gives money and deducts it wont be asked by the 
irs for money back he said 
however a staff member in the irs regional office in atlanta 
referring to a statement prepared on the case by irs spokesman les 
witmer said past contributions by ptl supporters will remain fully 
deductible until april 22 the date of the revocation 
in revoking ptls taxfree status the irs cited its own report 
last december which concluded that jim and tammy bakker and their 
aides profited excessively from donations made to the ministry 
the revocation extends back to 1981 if allowed to stand the 
financially troubled ministry will also owe taxes on proceeds from 
heritage usa much of which the irs ruled came from commercial 
rather than ministerial operations 
west said the ministry would argue in claims court that if ptls 
taxexempt status is lifted the decision should apply only to the 
years in which the bakkers controlled the ministry from 1981 
through 1987 
moreover he said ptl which is undergoing reorganization under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code was expecting a decision 
in federal bankruptcy court on its application for a new 
nonprofit ministry 
if that status is granted the new ministry would not be held 
responsible for debts of the old one he said 
irs spokesman witmer was attending a meeting in washington 
wednesday afternoon and could not be reached by telephone for 
comment said the irs staff member who asked not to be identified 
west said he was unsure whether news reports of the irs decision 
were affecting contributions to the ministry 
itll be about 10 days it takes that long for mails to come 
in and for ptl to see if theres been an impact west said

to do with the money and hundreds more wanted some of the money 
for themselves 
suggestions ranged from pleas for funding for organtransplant 
candidates to a request by lawrence welk fans to rebuild his 
birthplace in north dakota 
i think we made some wonderful choices but im glad its 
over said chapman its very rewarding for all of us

unless a court decision strikes him from the 
ballot secretary of state evan bayh is favored to win the 
democratic nomination for governor next tuesday and stage a strong 
bid to break indiana republicans 20year hold on the office 
in the presidential primary massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
is expected to defeat jesse jackson in the democratic race and 
vice president george bush who sewed up the gop nomination this 
week with his win in pennsylvania faces no active opposition in 
the republican contest 
republican sen richard g lugar is unopposed for nomination for 
a third term he will face indianapolis attorney jack wickes a 
former campaign staffer for gary hart in november wickes is 
unopposed in the democratic primary 
bayh the 32yearold son of former threeterm sen birch e 
bayh held a 7to1 advantage over former kokomo mayor stephen j 
daily in recent opinion polls he also led his probable gop 
opponent in the november election 
but there is still the question of the state supreme court 
ruling on bayhs residency which could come any time 
the court is reviewing a shelby county circuit court decision 
that found that bayh meets the fiveyear residency requirement for 
a governor even though he lived in washington dc while working 
as an attorney in 1983 and 1984 
circuit judge charles d oconnor ruled that bayh maintained his 
ties to his native state during his absence and always intended to 
return to indiana 
the republicancontrolled state election board appealed the 
ruling arguing for a strict interpretation of the constitutional 
residency requirement 
bayh initiated the court case after retiring gop gov robert d 
orr instructed the election board to investigate bayhs residency 
bayh claimed he couldnt get a fair hearing before the board and 
charged that republicans were trying to deny voters a choice in the 
election 
we have a political dynasty here of 20 years and they see the 
real possibility the power will slip through their fingers and 
theyre willing to do about anything to keep that from happening 
said bayh who would be the states youngest in this century and 
thirdyoungest in history 
a recent indianapolis star poll showed bayh leading daily by 70 
percent to 11 percent he also leads twoterm lt gov john m 
mutz who is unopposed in the gop gubernatorial primary by a 4833 
margin 
orr who is retiring because he is limited to two terms under 
the state constitution said he wants the supreme court to rule so 
there will be no lingering doubts about bayhs eligibility 
mutz initially supported the residency challenge but said after 
the first ruling that he wished the case wouldnt be appealed so 
the campaign could focus on other issues 
a 20year veteran of the general assembly and executive branch 
mutz said the real issue is bayhs lack of experience he also 
questions bayhs performance as secretary of state since taking 
office after defeating robert o bowen son of former governor and 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen in 1986 
who is ready now for indianas toughest job said mutz a 
52yearold former indianapolis businessman i would submit that 
one of the first things you have to look at in that respect is our 
demonstrated ability to perform our demonstrated ability to get 
results results not rhetoric 
in a reference to bayhs age mutz said were not talking 
about electing somebody class president here 
bayh replies that he would take office at 33 which was sen dan 
quayles age when he joined the senate after defeating bayhs 
father in 1980 
age is not relevant bayh said its ability its ideas 
its where you hope to lead indiana 
the governors office is not just some kind of gold watch that 
someone is awarded after 20 years of service bayh said 
mutz has promised to continue orrs commitment to improving 
schools and attracting new jobs to the state as lieutenant 
governor mutz has headed the states economic development efforts 
bayh counters that the orrmutz administration has brought 
indiana its two largest tax increases in history 
also on the democratic gubernatorial ballot is senate minority 
leader frank l obannon bayhs choice for lieutenant governor 
the bayh campaign decided to put obannon on the ballot as a 
precautionary move in case bayh is ruled ineligible

saudi arabias split with tehran will 
heighten irans isolation in the arab world and likely deepen us 
involvement in the persian gulf region arab diplomats said 
wednesday 
one arab ambassador speaking on condition of anonymity also 
said the saudis took a calculated risk by severing relations with 
iran because of the potential for retaliatory attacks against the 
oilrich kingdom and its allies 
soon after the ambassador spoke a bomb exploded outside the 
saudi national airline office in neighboring kuwait wounding a 
guard kuwaiti officials reported 
the prowestern saudis cited iranian terrorism and 
subversion when they announced the break tuesday on staterun 
media 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus broadcast a statement by 
irans foreign ministry on wednesday that blamed saudi arabian 
cooperation with us conspiracies in the persian gulf for the 
saudi move 
it also accused saudi arabia of providing enormous financial 
aid for iraq its foe in the 7yearold gulf war 
the break of diplomatic relations is occurring at the same 
time as the aggressions of america in the persian gulf and prove 
that america is governing saudi arabia prime minister hussein 
musavi was quoted as saying in a later broadcast 
iraq called the saudi move a logical and brave decision 
the saudi split comes on the heels of two major setbacks for the 
iranians 
on april 18 us warships and planes sank or crippled at least 
six iranian naval vessels the previous day the iraqis recaptured 
the southern faw peninsula which the iranians overran in february 
1986 
arab diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said king 
fahds government consulted with the united states before severing 
relations with tehran 
the united states on wednesday denied iranian accusations that 
it pressured saudi arabia to make the move 
but arab diplomats said washington is tacitly committed to 
defend saudi arabia the americans main friend and ally in the 
arab world 
the us will find itself more involved than ever before in 
the gulf region and we do not exclude antiiranian military 
deterrent action by the us navy one said 
after all the united states has come to regard iran as 
expendable besides the growing saudi flirtation with moscow 
cannot be overlooked 
he said the imminent withdrawal of soviet forces from 
afghanistan will open the door for the soviets to establish ties 
with saudi arabia and perhaps play a wider role in the gulf 
in its statement cutting ties to iran the saudis criticized 
tehran for a july 31 riot by iranian pilgrims in the holy moslem 
city of mecca in saudi arabia the subsequent ransacking of the 
saudi embassy in tehran and attacks on merchant ships in the gulf 
many of them owned by or trading with saudi arabia 
saudi arabia seeking to avoid more bloodshed during this years 
pilgrimage sought to limit the mumber of pilgrims and asked iran 
to cut its usual turnout of 150000 by about onethird 
despite the break the saudi ambassador in turkey said 45000 
iranian pilgrims would be allowed to make the pilgrimage this 
summer 
the iranians have said they will send 150000 and also defy a 
saudi ban on political demonstrations 
one manamabased arab ambassador said the basic thrust of the 
saudi move was to avoid a recurrence of the mecca violence in 
which by saudi count 402 pilgrims were killed 
although the principle of severing diplomatic ties is very 
much against the saudis nature many of us think it was long 
overdue in view of the fact that saudi patience with iran was 
wearing thin said the ambassador who insisted on anonymity 
after the mecca riots iran called for the overthrow of the 
saudi royal family 
on sunday an armed iranian speedboat rocketed a saudiowned 
tanker the sea trader in the strait of hormuz that came only 
hours after president reagan warned iran it would suffer very 
costly consequences if it did not stop raiding neutral ships in 
the gulf 
its obvious the united states is getting sick and tired of 
iran as are the saudis the kuwaitis and other powers in the 
gulf said one arab diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
kuwait its shipping under constant attack by iran turned to 
the united states for protection last year and reflagged 11 of its 
tankers with the stars and stripes 
kuwait also has accused iran of complicity in the april 5 
hijacking of a kuwait airways jetliner in which two kuwaitis were 
killed

a project to produce eyeglasses with miniature 
color tv screens instead of lenses to help people with low vision 
is a spinoff from the development of space stations researchers 
said wednesday 
the system is expected to provide clearer and more defined 
vision than can be produced by conventional eye treatment it may 
help an estimated 25 million people whose vision cant be improved 
by other means 
the device will not restore sight to those who are completely 
blind or improve nearsightedness farsightedness or astigmatism 
researchers at johns hopkins wilmer eye institute said at a news 
conference to announce the project but it will enhance what vision 
is left in people who suffer from degenerative eye disease they 
said 
wilmer and nasas national space technology laboratories will 
spend 5 million in the next five years to develop the system said 
robert massof a hopkins ophthalmology professor working on the 
project 
ray gilbert manager of the national aeronautics and space 
administrations technology applications engineering section said 
the system comes from research that helped create space stations 
we can use that technology to enhance life on earth for a 
person with low vision gilbert said 
it is recognizing an image through a software program and 
applying those kinds of principles to the lowvision device 
gilbert said 
the device would be used by people who have poor vision as a 
result of diabetes aging and other causes 
it would not only magnify and enhance images but be able to 
zoom in on an object or distort it to improve the sight of people 
with tunnel vision massof said 
they will not look through the screens but at the screens 
massof said for a long time the only thing thats been done for 
people with low vision is provide them with a magnifier with the 
technology available we believed we could do more than simply 
enlarge it 
nasa scientists will adapt the technology for the glasses while 
researchers at wilmer will determine what the system has to do to 
alter a patients vision massof said 
the device would resemble wraparound sunglasses with small 
lenses in the frames connected by optical fibers to a 
batterypowered computer at the waist massof said 
the lenses would capture the field of vision and images would 
be conveyed to miniature solidstate television cameras in the 
waist pack he said the images would be processed by the computer 
and displayed on the color television screens where the lenses 
would be 
the breakthrough is the technology that made this all 
possible massof said we are not creating new components for 
this however the existing technology will have to be 
miniaturized and refined he said and researchers have set a goal 
of completing that work in five years 
about 11 million americans have vision defects that cannot be 
corrected the glasses could benefit about 25 million people who 
suffer from severe disabling impairment or low vision said dr 
arnall patz director of the eye institute 
those who would be helped by the glasses are still potentially 
productive people they can probably get around but are unable to 
read recognize faces or things may be very reduced in 
contrast so they look somewhat blank massof said 
for the patient who has reduction in sensitivity to contrasts 
where blacks and whites look gray we can sharpen up the 
contrast and make blacks much blacker whites much whiter he 
said 
he could not say what it would cost but said the eyeglasses 
could be assembled for less than 1000 it will be of no value 
unless it is made affordable for the person who is retired and on a 
fixed income he said 
researchers hope it would qualify for insurance coverage as a 
rehabilitative device he said

the pentagon has concluded that iran did not 
fire any of its large silkworm missiles against navy ships during 
last weeks persian gulf fighting defense officials said wednesday 
the officials who spoke only on condition they not be named 
stressed that pentagon analysts were not disputing that missiles of 
some type had been fired by iran against the destroyers joseph 
strauss and obrien and the frigate jack williams 
there were missiles fired which our ships successfully 
evaded one source said but there are strong indicators they 
werent silkworms 
while nailing down what type of missiles were fired might seem 
academic the defense sources said the matter had been 
exhaustively investigated 
they explained that any evidence proving silkworms had been 
fired would demonstrate that iran was raising the military stakes 
in the gulf the silkworm a chinesebuilt version of an old 
russian antiship missile is the most powerful missile in the 
iranian arsenal even though it has a fairly rudimentary guidance 
system the sources said 
most of the silkworms believed purchased by iran are designed to 
be fired from mobile ground launchers the sources continued 
meaning their use would suggest iran intends to go beyond reliance 
on gunboats to attack commercial shipping 
the united states has pledged to destroy any silkworm battery if 
it uncovers evidence a missile is about to be fired 
the question of the silkworms use arose in the aftermath of the 
fighting that erupted april 18 after the navy destroyed two 
offshore iranian platforms in retaliation for the mining of the 
frigate uss samuel b roberts 
six iranian ships were crippled or sunk during a wave of 
fighting that erupted around the southern gulf after those attacks 
on the two platforms during the confrontation the williams 
strauss and obrien operating in the strait of hormuz were 
fired upon with missiles they monitored electronically and which 
crewmen described to reporters as silkworms 
the defense sources refused to discuss all of the strong 
indicators that showed the missiles were not silkworms one 
official did say however that all known silkworm launch sites on 
the coast of iran and the naval base at bandar abbas where the 
weapons are stored had been under constant surveillance during 
the fighting 
if they had moved one out we would have seen it the 
official said 
another source disclosed there was some evidence a silkworm 
might have been fired that day during fighting on the ground at the 
northern end of the gulf along the faw peninsula iraqi forces 
staged a successful ground offensive to retake that area from iran 
as the naval battles raged in the southern gulf 
there was one longrange electronic sighting up north during 
the battle for al faw that could have been a silkworm the source 
said 
but weve pretty exhaustively investigated what happened in 
the gulf and reached the conclusion that no silkworms were fired at 
us

soviet broadcasting executives refused to air a 
usproduced television report exploring parallels in the problems 
of men who fought in vietnam and afghanistan an american tv 
journalist said wednesday 
jean enersen an anchor from kingtv in seattle said the 
program had been scheduled for wednesdays television program 120 
minutes as one of five usproduced reports to be shown this 
week on that show 
the segment featured glen webster a veteran of the vietnam war 
from snohomish wash who talked about the problems caused by 
the war including drug addiction suicidal tendencies and 
alcoholism said enersen 
enersen with a soviet crew interviwed several soviet veterans 
from afghanistan to seek their comments for the report to be shown 
on staterun tv 
however she said she was told on tuesday by pavel korchagin a 
producer in the foreign relations department of the soviet 
broadcasting authority gostelradio that the segment would not be 
broadcast 
he said it would cause too much pain for the soviet people 
and that theyre not ready to start dealing with these issues 
enersen said of korchagin 
instead another report prepared by enersen and her crew about 
economic reforms in the soviet consumer sector was broadcast 
wednesday she said 
she also said the soviet veterans she spoke to were less than 
forthcoming in their comments about social and readjustment 
problems caused by the afgahn war 
they were not interested in discussing those issues and the 
soviet government was not interested in broadcasting those issue 
she said 
enersen said she had been invited to moscow to film reports on 
any five topics she chose to be broadcast on 120 minutes and 
accompanied by her live commentary 
it was believed to be the first time a us journalist had been 
allowed to give live commentary on soviet tv and a clear 
manifestation of mikhail s gorbachevs drive for glasnost or 
greater openness 
however glasnost has only been spottily applied by the 
staterun media to the soviet military involvement in afghanistan 
and covernment officials have never said how many soviet soldiers 
have died there or even how many are fighting

on a clear day in crete the myth of 
daedalus and the reality of kanellos kanellopoulos drew uncannily 
close 
daedulus was a mythical greek hero who built wings from wax and 
feathers and flew across the aegean sea his son icarus tried to 
soar to the sun and fell into the sea 
kanellopoulos is a real greek hero a champion bicyclist who 
likes to draw pictures of birds on april 23 flying a fragile 
airplane powered by pedals pushed by his powerful legs he 
duplicated daedalus feat 
he flew farther than anyone else in a humanpowered plane but 
like icarus he has his sights on a goal he considers much loftier 
than flying from one place to another 
two days after his feat the tall laconic greek was training 
for the olympics in seoul 
its true the flight was something different but what ive 
really wanted all along is to win a place for the olympics he 
said 
i was just lucky lucky to have my turn as pilot that day 
and lucky to accomplish the flight 
kanellopoulos a greek cycling champion for 14 years and a 
specialist in endurance events has a reputation for coolness that 
showed at the end of the 74mile flight from crete to santorini 
when the plane the daedalus 88 crashed in the sea just 10 
yards offshore he stayed calm 
i knew the job was done so i unhooked my pedal clips and just 
walked through the wreckage to the beach he said 
the 72pound aircraft built of hitech fiber compounds and 
ultrathin plastic sheeting collapsed on impact 
kanellopoulos flight took just three hours 54 minutes at an 
average speed of 18 mph it broke the record of 372 miles for 
humanpowered flight set in january 1987 by glenn tremml who 
powered a daedalus 88 prototype around edward air force base in 
california it also broke bryan allens 1979 straightline record 
of 22 miles across the english channel 
kanellos is a really good athlete by the end of the flight he 
had his heart rate way down and he could have gone almost double 
the distance said steve k bussolari a massachusetts institute 
of technology expert on human aerospace factors who headed flight 
operations for the project 
kanellopoulos who turned 31 two days after the flight joined a 
group of four american athletepilots in the united states last 
year on the final sixmonth training period for the mit project 
he was exactly the right kind of athlete a longduration 
cyclist who could produce a lot of power for his weight and i 
judged he had the temperament for a project that took patience 
bussolari said 
for kanellopoulos humanpowered flying was a challenge that 
could be combined with his olympic preparations 
learning to fly wasnt hard and the training program wasnt 
so different from what i was planning to do in greece he said 
the other pilots described kanellopoulos as a dedicated athlete 
who quickly learned to handle the delicate daedalus prototypes 
despite his 6foot2 158pound frame 
kanellos speaks good english and he learned real fast hes 
the biggest and strongest of us and he sometimes had to ease off 
the power so he didnt break the plane said tremml 27 from new 
haven conn one of the planes pilots 
kanellos likes to play the cool tough guy but i could see how 
his knees were trembling when he was sitting in the plane waiting 
to take off tremml added 
in athens kanellopoulos a highschool physical education 
teacher who works for the government sports secretariat lives in a 
small apartment at the athens olympic stadium village 
the daedalus flight is unlikely to add to his renown 
his gold medals at two successive mediterranean games were a 
rare achievement for this small nation which doesnt have the 
resources to produce worldclass sportsmen despite its ancient 
athletic tradition 
like many modern greeks kanellopoulos takes the ancient glories 
for granted 
i first learned the daedalus legend as a kid at school but 
then were born with ancient ruins and mythology and we live with 
them all the time so they dont give us such strong feelings 
he said

the supreme court upholding a practice used 
in most states ruled wednesday that parents who fail to pay 
courtordered child support may be jailed even if their ability to 
pay is not proved 
by an 80 vote the justices said citing such parents for civil 
contempt and jailing them until they pay does not violate 
constitutionally protected dueprocess rights 
but the court said a finding of criminal contempt which also 
can spark a jail sentence would be unconstitutional without proof 
the parent is able to pay the child support 
sally goldfarb a lawyer for the national organization for 
womens legal defense and education fund called the decision an 
important victory because in most states such contempt 
proceedings are clearly civil 
one reason that contempt is such an important tool is that 
there are many absent fathers who are unwilling to meet their legal 
and moral obligations to their children unless they are threatened 
with jail ms goldfarb said 
many parents who claim they dont have a dollar to spare for 
child support suddenly come up with thousands of dollars once the 
jail cell door closes behind them she said 
in most states court orders withholding wages of parents 
delinquent in making childsupport payments are becoming 
increasingly available but ms goldfarb said jail is a 
particularly powerful remedy against selfemployed parents or 
those able to hide their financial assets 
in another decision the court raised the possibility that 
states may deny unemployment benefits to workers fired for using 
illegal drugs during religious ceremonies 
the justices ordered oregon courts to determine whether two men 
who used the hallucinogenic drug peyote during native american 
religious ceremonies may have a right to unemployment benefits 
the childsupport ruling sent back to state courts a california 
case in which five justices could not determine whether a divorced 
father had been held in civil or criminal contempt 
philip and alta sue feiock were divorced in orange county 
calif in 1976 as part of the divorce judgment feiock was 
ordered to pay 150 a month in child support for his three children 
after feiock failed to make any payments a state judge ruled he 
was in contempt of court and gave him a 25day suspended jail 
sentence feiock was placed on three years probation and ordered to 
begin making the childsupport payments or be jailed 
a state appeals court threw out feiocks contempt citation 
ruling that the states childsupport law creates an 
unconstitutional mandatory presumption that a parent is able to 
make the payments thus relieving prosecutors of proving that fact 
in sending the case back to the california courts justice byron 
r white said the high court is uncertain whether feiock was cited 
for civil or criminal contempt 
under civil contempt a person is jailed until complying with a 
court order criminal contempt is punishment and normally involves 
a specific jail term unrelated to compliance with the court order 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor and antonin scalia although agreeing with white that 
civil contempt may be imposed without a finding of ability to pay 
voted to reinstate feiocks contempt citation they said his 
proceeding clearly was civil not criminal 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the case

police commissioner benjamin ward who had 
called on mayor edward i koch to apologize for his remarks on 
jesse jackson said wednesday he was satisfied with the mayors 
explanation even though koch refused to call it an apology 
ward a koch appointee who is the top black official in the 
city added that koch is an outstanding mayor and vowed to put 
the matter behind him 
on tuesday ward denounced kochs blistering criticism of 
jackson as divisive and said the mayor should apologize 
but he said wednesday he had since learned that koch said in 
washington he was sorry that the stridency of his remarks 
during the new york democratic presidential primary campaign had 
offended some jackson followers koch also wrote a letter of 
explanation of his criticism to the new york times 
koch said in the letter it was never my intent to draw 
political lines with racial or religious borders 
when asked at a news conference on an unrelated matter if he was 
satisfied with kochs remarks ward said absolutely 
im not one to look back he added im not going to look 
back i think we ought to go forward 
koch was asked if his letter was an apology to jackson 
im not characterizing it he said he said he would let his 
letter speak for itself 
asked about his relationship with ward koch said hes one of 
the great police commissioners he is a very great friend of mine 
there is no breach between us if anything i suspect maybe the 
relationship is stronger 
koch had criticized jacksons stand on israel and said jews and 
other supporters of that nation would be crazy to vote for him

a group urging religious freedom in the soviet 
union said wednesday it had assurances from president reagan that 
he would press the issue at his summit with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
at a white house meeting monday the group gave reagan a 
petition signed by 240 prominent americans urging wider religious 
freedom as the russian orthodox church celebrates its 1000th 
anniversary 
the petition released at a news conference wednesday is 
addressed to gorbachev its publication was financed by the james 
madison foundation a private research group which says it is 
dedicated to world peace and against communism 
george weigel president of the foundation said reagan assured 
him that he would indeed make our cause part of the summit 
agenda 
the petition says human rights issues and paramount among 
them the fundamental human right of religious freedom or freedom of 
conscience are not peripheral matters on the ussoviet agenda 
weigel said 
white house aides said the petition may be presented to soviet 
officials during the may 29june 2 summit though probably not 
personally by the president earlier this week reagan said in a 
speech that irritated gorbachev that the soviets could never have 
truly normal relations with the united states as long as it 
violated human rights 
the petition calls for recognition of religious organizations 
legalization of the greek catholic ukrainian catholic church 
freedom to teach religion to children emigration for believers and 
a general amnesty for all religious prisoners of conscience 
it is signed by people from a broad range of religious and 
political opinion including members of congress educators 
journalists and religious organizations

civil rights activists said 
wednesday they expect severe conflict because of a government 
decision to get around a court ruling and merge of two black 
communities 
the transvaal rural action committee also protested the 
designation of oukasie a 55yearold black township as an 
emergency camp governed by strict new regulations it depicted 
tuesdays declaration as an attempt to demoralize the people of 
oukasie who have resisted efforts to force them out 
activists thought the merger dispute was resolved last month 
when south africas highest court said president pw botha 
exceeded his authority by incorporating the 120000member 
community of moutse into the adjoining homeland of kwandebele on 
dec 31 1985 
scores of people in moutse were killed in fighting that followed 
the incorporation 
chris heunis the constitutional development minister revived 
the issue tuesday by saying the government would introduce 
legislation to circumvent the ruling so the incorporation could 
proceed he did not elaborate 
a statement from the transvaal committee said it fears this 
latest announcement will once again cause severe conflict in the 
moutse area 
its going to leave the community devastated and bitter 
said joanne yawitch of multiracial private group which provides 
aid on legal and other problems to blacks in the northeastern 
province 
the community had absolute faith in the courts judgment yet 
they see the government has no repect for that she said 
most moutse residents belong to the north sotho tribe and 
opposed the merger they have great differences in language and 
culture with ndebeles who make up most of the 400000 people in 
kwandebele an impoverished district northeast of pretoria 
moutse residents also fear the government in pretoria will 
designate kwandebele as one of the nominally independent black 
homelands thus depriving its residents of south african 
citizenship 
kwandebele is one of six semiautonomous black homelands four 
other homelands have been declared independent but the status is 
not recognized abroad 
after the forced merger residents of moutse battled police and 
vigilantes aligned with kwandebele officials who had sought 
incorporation in order to help their bid for independence 
botha said tuesday it would serve no purpose to meet again with 
moutse community leaders since he already knew they opposed 
incorporation 
about oukasie field workers of the transvaal committee said the 
emergency camp designation meant it no longer was governed by 
regular municipal laws and might be vulnerable to abolition by the 
government 
about 5000 oukasie residents have complied with government 
efforts to relocate them 15 miles away but 8000 have refused to 
move 
under the new regulations governing oukasie residents must get 
permission to have overnight guests renovate their homes or keep 
pets 
activists say the government wants to demolish oukasie because 
whites in the town of brits say the township is too close the 
official reason for the proposed removal is that oukasie is a slum 
and renovating it would cost too much 
government officials said tuesdays declaration meant no new 
residents would be allowed in oukasie but denied it was a prelude 
to forced removal 
the committee called the designation a further attempt to 
totally demoralize and intimidate the community so that ultimately 
they move voluntarily 
field worker alan morris said what we see is maybe the final 
weapon in the states armory short of sending the bulldozers in

michael dukakis said wednesday he would be 
delighted to debate republican george bush in the fall on such 
issues as the irancontra affair but he insisted he has not yet 
wrapped up the democratic nomination 
the massachusetts governor doggedly promised to campaign in 
every primary state through california even after a smashing win 
in pennsylvania on tuesday over democratic presidential jesse 
jackson gave him a big lead in the nomination fight 
dukakis brushed aside concerns that jacksons attempts to set 
the policy agenda would split the democrats even as he fired again 
at bush the certain gop nominee 
i see very broad agreement in the democratic party he told 
reporters in a statehouse news conference i dont believe it is 
going to be very difficult to get a good strong platform 
the democratic hopeful spent most of the day on state business 
before going to springfield mass to highlight his support for 
plantclosing legislation nearing final passage in washington he 
took the occasion to fire a round at bush on whether bush supports 
president reagans promised veto of the bill 
i think the vice president would be well advised to stop 
criticizing others for a while and address some fundamental issues 
facing this country dukakis told the news conference where is 
he on the plantclosing bill doesnt he think it is the right and 
fair thing to let workers and their families know at least 60 days 
in advance that they are going to be thrown out of work 
bush said earlier wednesday that he was ready for attacks on the 
irancontra affair 
let him fire away bush said 
dukakis obliged he sat there and did nothing while we engaged 
in one of the worst and one of the most misguided adventures in the 
history of american foreign policy i cant imagine what they were 
thinking of when they proceeded to do business with a terrorist 
nation 
later he added thats going to be an issue in the campaign 
no question about it 
he also took a swipe at those who said a bushdukakis campaign 
would be a fight between dull politicians 
ive never been in a dull boring contest in my life and i 
dont expect this one to be one either he said 
dukakis was always careful to preface his comments about the 
fall campaign with the supposition that he would be the nominee 
after winning the tuesday primary he promised to campaign in every 
state primary between now and june 7 
that strategy is not only an effort to avoid an embarrassing 
loss for the frontrunner but also to build for the fall campaign 
we are working hard in california said dukakis campaign 
manager susan estrich california is also very important in the 
general election as much as we can do there now is also an 
investment for the fall 
dukakis heads back out on the campaign trail thursday to ohio 
which holds a primary next tuesday along with indiana and the 
district of columbia 
the six weeks between may 3 and june 7 will be busy ones for 
dukakis his aides say but less with campaigning and more with 
efforts directed at pulling the democrats together and getting 
ready for the fall 
he will return to states which have already taken part in the 
primary process such as texas make major speeches on education 
jobs and the environment he will travel to washington to meet with 
party leaders and perhaps make a commencement address on a black 
university campus to symbolize his reaching out to the black 
community that has been solidly behind jackon

when soviet soldiers leave afghanistan that 
nation could face civil war resembling the turmoil in lebanon and 
provide a tempting target for iran or other outside forces a 
pakistani opposition leader said wednesday 
it is urgent for the united states pakistan the united nations 
and others with potential influence to encourage formation of a 
stable broadbased future afghan government benazir bhutto told a 
news conference 
otherwise there is the threat of continuing civil war and the 
threat of fragmentation of afghanistan sucking in others she 
said 
pakistanis coping with an influx of more than 3 million afghan 
refugees who fled soviet occupation fear that instead of those 
refugees who are in pakistan returning maybe even more refugees 
will come because of continuing civil war in afghanistan said 
ms bhutto chairwoman of the pakistan peoples party 
the other fear is that afghanistan is in danger of 
becoming another lebanon with different factions holding sway in 
different parts she continued 
if there is a vacuum it will be difficult for pakistan to 
just ignore the situation on the other side there are 
persianspeaking afghans iran so far has not taken any deep 
interest in afghan internal affairs nonetheless it may find in a 
vacuum it is also tempted to exert its influence ms bhutto said 
it is certain that a vacuum being created in afghanistan is 
dangerous she said thus the united states pakistan or any of 
the countries in the world with influence should work together 
through un undersecretarygeneral diego cordovez or other 
auspices to try and form a coalition or leadership which is 
acceptable to the afghans 
cordovez is the ecuadorean un official negotiated the accord 
under which an estimated 115000 soviet soldiers are to begin 
leaving afghanistan next month he has announced plans to turn his 
efforts to the problem of transition from the marxist regime 
installed when the soviets arrived at the end of 1979 
ms bhutto said pakistanis expect the present afghan 
administration not to last after soviet withdrawal after its 
collapse she predicted various afghan groups although divided 
among themselves will all march unitedly toward kabul if some 
solution is not worked out beforehand then we can have these 
different factions fighting each other 
describing the united states as both pakistans principal aid 
donor and a source of influence toward democratization ms bhutto 
said it is of concern that us interest for pakistan and 
indeed the democratization process should not wane many of us 
fear that the democratization process could well be aborted after 
an afghanistan settlement she added 
ms bhutto said pakistans transition to full democracy 
could be difficult if president mohammed zia ulhaq runs for 
reelection because it is questionable whether he would permit 
opposition parties such as hers to contest for seats or to control 
parliament 
the peoples party was founded by ms bhuttos father the late 
prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto who was overthrown in a 
bloodless 1977 coup led by zia and was hanged two years later 
after being convicted of ordering a political murder

for 20yearold yuri mushnikov the 
end of the war in afghanistan is only seven days away 
on may 4 the native siberian will get his wakeup call for the 
flight back to the soviet union 
the sunburned blond soldier who has served two years without 
home leave says hes seen all the horrors of war and never wants to 
see any more 
this war is evil he said as he guarded a dusty outpost at 
kabuls southeastern perimeter no one needs this war 
for his comrades performing their internationalist duty by 
defending the government of president najib against anticommunst 
guerrillas the war is almost over as well at least it feels that 
way 
im ready to do my part and be among the first to leave 
joked sgt alexander sayenko a career soldier from krasnodar in 
southern russia 
after explaining to two american reporters that he wasnt 
authorized to speak for his regiment he confirmed that morale 
among the soviet troops in afghanistan has improved greatly since 
the signing april 14 of an agreement calling for withdrawal of all 
red army forces 
i havent seen my wife for 10 months of course we are excited 
about going home said sayenko all we can say is thank god 
none of the seven soldiers interviewed wednesday said they 
considered it a mistake for the soviet union to have come to the 
aid of the government forces in afghanistan but all expressed 
fatigue with their role in the war that has raged in this moslem 
country for 10 years 
everyone is very happy that we are going home soon said 
capt andrei dobrovolskz 31 of the moldavian city of rybnitsa 
but in any event our goals were accomplished here by the signing 
of the agreement in geneva 
while the accord sets out plans for soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan no one expects the fighting to end immediately that 
belief was underscored wednesday when a bomb exploded in kabul 
killing six people and injuring dozens more 
since the signing of the accord which sets a may 15 date for 
the start of a soviet pullout expected to be completed by the end 
of the year morale among the soviet troops has improved markedly 
the soldiers said 
the relaxed atmosphere was apparent in their readiness to talk 
openly without the approval of superiors and the general sense that 
for them the war is nearly over 
their candid disclosure that they had seen others die in battle 
and felt the pain of uncertainty about the soviet role was in sharp 
contrast with the past attitudes 
on previous visits to kabul foreign reporters approaching 
soviet soldiers were chased away before getting close enough to 
speak warning shots were fired over the heads of four american 
journalists who tried to photograph a unit near the airport in 
january 1987 
despite the improved atmosphere it is still unpleasant for 
soviets in afghanistan afghans close their eyes when they pass 
soviet soldiers in a sign of rejection and the soldiers have been 
ordered to stay out of public markets where troops have been 
stabbed by afghans opposed to their involvement in the war 
we want the russians to leave our country a student in his 
early 20s said in broken english adding that many would like to 
see a return of the king who lives in italy 
for the afghans the toughest battles may lie ahead after the 
115000 soviets in afghanistan leave najibs estimated 40000 
troops to fend for themselves against a factional but sizable 
guerrilla force 
the afghan soldiers cannot succeed without our help time will 
show that said mushnikov but everyone is sick of the war in 
afghanistan 
mushnikov from the siberian city of irkutsk said he had seen 
everything during battles to defend the southern city of kandahar 
against guerrilla attacks 
what happens to the afghanistan government is a matter for the 
afghans themselves to decide the soldiers said 
a private from the ukrainian city of donetsk who would identify 
himself only as sergei said it was none of the soviets business 
who leads the country and that the sooner they ended their 
involvement the better

38caliber revolver cotugno a student at iona college spent two 
weeks in the hospital recovering

forgive me 
the two pulled over at a scarsdale exit after an incident on the 
hutchinson river parkway in westchester county salomon maintained

the national school boards association on 
wednesday urged schools to take a more active role in identifying 
alcohol and drug abusers and in developing programs to help those 
students 
in a 60page report the association suggested that schools 
designate at least one person such as the school nurse or a 
specially hired drug counselor to serve as an adviser and liaison 
between students teachers parents and outside treatment programs 
the report also recommended that schools develop policies on 
substance abuse and teach students beginning in kindergarten 
about the effects of drug and alcohol and how to avoid peer 
pressure to use them 
the association said the education programs should start out 
with simple explanations in the early grades and gradually get more 
detailed in later grades starting drug prevention programs at the 
high school level is too late the report said 
while this problem of drug and alcohol abuse shouldnt be 
imposed on school systems schools werent created to deal with 
social problems this problem does affect education association 
president leonard rovins said in announcing release of the 
alcohol and drugs in the schools report 
rovins said that substance abuse can affect students ability to 
learn and can cause problems ranging from chronic truancy and 
falling grades to family violence and suicide 
he estimated that more than half of all school districts now 
have policies dealing with drug and alcohol abuse but warned that 
although student use of cocaine and marijuana is down use of crack 
and alcohol is up 
clearly he said the battle is far from won 
rovins said the report will be distributed to school boards 
across the country

the house approved a pair of arms control 
restrictions wednesday rejecting criticism that it might hurt next 
months ussoviet summit meeting 
the two provisions were added to the pentagon budget bill and 
were similar to restrictions added in each of the past two years by 
the democraticcontrolled chamber in votes which split largely 
along party lines 
the white house had lobbied against both restrictions as it had 
in the past and also opposes several other democraticbacked 
provisions scheduled to be considered by the chamber during the 
next three weeks 
first the house voted 252159 to ban any tests of star wars 
antimissile defense systems which would violate the narrow 
interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
then the chamber gave 240174 approval to a ban on spending for 
any weapons that would violate the numerical restrictions on 
various types of atomic weapons that are contained in the 1979 salt 
ii treaty president reagan says the soviets are violating the 
unratified treaty and he wont be guided any longer by its 
restrictions 
rep duncan hunter rcalif opposed the amendments and told 
democrats why you want to cripple ronald reagan three weeks 
before the summit is beyond me 
reagan will travel to moscow on may 29 to meet with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev it will be the fourth time the two 
leaders have met in the past three years 
democrats responded to hunter by noting that the limitations had 
been added to past pentagon budget bills and had not harmed arms 
control efforts 
this is the same kind of thing weve done before and there 
hasnt been a problem said rep norman dicks dwash chief 
sponsor of the salt ii provision 
the amendments were added to a bill authorizing 2995 billion 
in pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 the 
total is about the same as this years defense budget and it 
resulted from last decembers budget summit between reagan and 
congress which was designed to lower the federal budget deficit 
the bill that passes the house will have to be reconciled with 
the separate measure which will be passed by the senate that 
chamber is moving more slowly on the pentagon budget which is now 
being written by the senate armed services committee 
the abm restriction arises from a threeyear fight that has its 
roots in reagans assertion that he has the legal authority to 
unilaterally change how the united states inteprets the 1972 pact 
a broad interpretation would allow widescale tests of the 
strategic defense initiative the formal name of reagans star wars 
program 
but congressional democrats have disputed reagans claim and 
the white house has not pressed the issue none of the sdi tests 
scheduled for the next 18 months would violate the strict 
interpretation 
rep henry hyde rill called the restrictions unilateral 
disarmament of a benign but nonetheless serious sort 
but rep john spratt dsc were not doing anything more 
than what the administration says it is doing 
in another matter wednesday the house voted without dissent to 
name the navys next trident ballistic submarine after the late 
rep melvin price dill calling it a fitting tribute to the 
champion of the nations nuclear fleet 
price a 22term congressional veteran died friday of cancer at 
age 83 
price was chairman of the house armed services committee for 10 
years he also was a member of the defunct joint committee on 
atomic energy and was one of the chief congressional proponents of 
developing nuclearpowered submarines and surface ships

an israeli girl whose death raised a furor in 
the occupied lands was fatally shot by a careless jewish settler 
during a clash provoked by hostile arabs an israeli army report 
concluded wednesday 
tirza porat 15 the first jewish settler to die in the wave of 
unrest in the israelioccupied territories since dec 8 was a 
victim of an errant bullet and not an arab stone the report 
but the report placed the bulk of the blame on arabs from the 
west bank town of beita for triggering the april 6 fight with 
jewish hikers from the settlement of elon moreh 
miss porat and two arab villagers were killed in the clash 
romam aldubi 26 an israeli soldier on leave who was guarding the 
hikers was critically wounded by stones 
the report said aldubi who killed a fleeing arab by shooting 
him in the back acted overanxiously and negligently during the 
clash 
ms porat was shot by aldubis gun apparently after he 
reacted instinctively to the rock thrown at his head the report 
said the possibility that an additional weapon was used 
against the hikers was not proven 
the army report was meant to clear the air after conflicting 
versions of the incident caused nationwide controversy and anguish 
the army initially said the girl died from a stone thrown by 
palestinians prompting a wave of retaliatory violence by jewish 
settlers against arabs in the occupied territories 
subsequent reports indicated that the girl was killed by an 
israeli weapon some hikers contended that an arab had shot the 
girl 
the final army report placed most of the blame on the villagers 
the motivation and aggressiveness of the local residents who 
deliberately attacked jewish hikers was the major cause of the 
incident and led to the tragic conclusion the report said 
but it also criticized the settlers for hiking in the area 
without coordinating their movements with the army 
villages began throwing stones from afar when the hikers stopped 
for breakfast in a dry riverbed near beita the report said 
it said aldubi fired several warning shots and the group 
continued to walk along the riverbed until it encountered a large 
group of villagers who also threw stones 
aldubi fired again killing villager mussa salah daud who was 
shot in the back as he fled the scene the report said aldubi 
wounded a second villager taisir sallah adili in the stomach 
the report criticized aldubi saying negligence in operating 
the weapon ignoring common sense precautions and overhastiness 
in pulling the trigger were contributing factors to the escalation 
of events in this tragic incident 
after the shooting hundreds of villagers surrounded the 
israelis and forced them to walked into the center of beita 
in beita the sister of the man killed in the riverbed threw a 
rock at aldubi provoking a mass riot the report said villagers 
attacked the group with rocks clubs and anything that came to 
hand the report said 
the report said that aldubi was hit by the rock and 
instinctively fired several bullets while turning around 
he fired again when one of the villagers tried to grab his gun 
it was during these shootings that miss porat and the second 
palestinian were killed and another villager was wounded the 
report said 
we fully trust the final report uri ariel head of the 
council of jewish settlements in the west bank told israel radio 
but ariel called for additional punishment of beita villagers 
the army has destroyed 14 houses expelled six beita residents 
to lebanon and detained dozens for questioning 
bezalel reshef a leader of the leftwing peace now movement 
criticized the crackdown and said it had led to a serious 
deterioration of arabjewish relations the settlers used this 
event to incite the public and their leaders

a toxic chemical leak that threatened part of the 
capitals water supply has washed safely beyond a treatment plant 
authorities said wednesday 
it was an awfully scary feeling said eijiro motegi deputy 
director of the water department deadly chemcials were 
approaching while more than 2 million residents were about to go 
waterless 
the leak occurred monday when workers at diesel kiki cos 
sayama factory about 30 miles north of tokyo were operating a 
pump that processes toxic metalcoating chemicals the chemicals 
including 77 pounds of sodium cyanide enough to kill 350000 
people leaked into the iruma river police said 
fatal levels of sodium cyanide were detected tuesday near the 
spill site environmental officials said 1000 fish were killed 
but no residents fell ill 
authorities temporarily stopped taking water from one of their 
plants when sodium cyanide was detected nearby the tokyo 
metropolitan government which depends less heavily on the river 
for its water switched to another source 
authorities suspect the leak occurred when a worker forgot to 
shut a valve on the pump completely said masami takagi of sayama

on the west bank and gaza strip rocks and 
bullets are the projectiles of choice in the battle between 
israelis and palestinians in america the battle is waged with 
newspaper advertisements 
sometimes the only way to get what you want said into the 
newspaper is to pay for it said ruth popkin president of 
hadassah the jewish womens group that placed an ad calling for a 
dialogue between women in the mideast 
there are ads that call for an end to all aid to apartheid 
israel there are ads that say we stand with israelis in 
your hour of trial are confident in your essential decency and 
commitment to democratic values 
readers of the new york times and the washington post have grown 
accustomed to such ads through the years the christian science 
monitor the wall street journal the boston globe the nation 
harpers and the new york review of books also are favored media 
for issues ads 
now smaller newspapers like the santa barbara calif 
newspress have found that they too are serving as soapboxes for 
mideast matters 
robert rawls responsible for advocacy advertising at the 
washington post says the paper considers it an important source of 
revenue we particularly carry a lot of advertising on anything 
concerning israel or the middle east because those different groups 
have money to spend he said 
free speech is not cheap a fullpage ad in the new york times 
costs about 40000 a similar ad in the washington post costs 
30000 
though arabamericans have purchased some ads most have been 
initiated by jews and the ads divergent viewpoints reflect 
conflicts within the jewish community on israels policies in the 
occupied territories 
in march daniel benson and four other new york city 
professionals organized the ad hoc committee for middle east policy 
options 
benson said the five put up 36000 for the first of a series of 
ads in the times because they wanted visiting israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to know that some american jews support his 
position 
they joined the war of the ads as he called it to decrease 
the pressure on israel to trade territory for socalled peace 
we see the riots as just another phase in the campaign against 
israel in the war against israel said benson 
in contrast mark bruzonsky an attorney who used to work for 
the american jewish congress arranged an ad that advocates 
reducing us aid to israel as well as military and intelligence 
cooperation 
we as american jews dont want to be associated with what 
israel is doing said bruzonsky its both embarrassing and 
shameful that the united states continues to support these 
policies which are abhorrent 
it is no secret that the jewish lobby is extremely powerful 
members of congress are afraid of speaking out bruzonsky said 
that made it more important that american jews like ourselves 
have the courage to speak out 
michael lerner editor of tikkun magazine and an organizer of an 
ad campaign calling for an end to the military occupation said he 
has received death threats in the mail because of the ads 
but jack mondlak says his apartment has been inundated with mail 
supporting his fullpage ads in the times calling upon israel to 
maintain control over the territories 
it is not true what some people say that the american jewish 
community is divided over israel 99 percent are steadfast behind 
israel he said he has spent 300000 of his publishing fortune 
on ads in dozens of papers 
some advertisers seek to balance what they call biased news 
coverage the foundation for middle east peace ran an ad detailing 
a palestinian proposals for steps toward peace that it thought 
reporters had overlooked

travelers seem to have accepted the new curbs 
on cigarette smoking aboard commercial jetliners with no major 
incidents reported during the first few days of the restrictions 
airline officials report 
while many smokers have complained about the smoking ban on 
domestic lights of two hours or less they have made no attempt to 
challenge it said spokesmen for more than a halfdozen major 
airlines and the flight attendants union 
there has been no problem that im aware of i think most 
people were aware of the rule and took it in stride usair 
spokesman david shipley said wednesday smoking was prohibited on 
about 90 percent of usairs flights when the ban went into effect 
at 1201 am saturday 
cindy yeast a spokeswoman for the association of flight 
attendants which has 21000 members at most of the major air 
carriers said the smoking curb seems to be working well and 
she knew of no incidents 
at northwest airlines where the ban went beyond government 
requirements and includes all domestic flights except those to 
hawaii officials said they anticipated some challenges to the 
rule but have had none 
we didnt have a single incident where weve even had to chide 
anybody we anticipated more of a problem than there was 
said northwest spokesman bob gibbons 
spokesmen for other airlines made similar reports 
the regulation carries a penalty of up to 1000 for anyone 
violating the ban and up to 2000 if a passenger tampers with a 
smoke alarm in an aircraft lavatory in an effort to take some 
undetected puffs 
leslie roland a spokeswoman for the air transport association 
the airlines trade group attributed the smooth introduction of 
the restrictions to advance warning given passengers she also said 
introduction of the rule was made easier because it came on a 
weekend when air travel generally is less hectic 
frankly i was surprised she said 
its really been a nonevent said bill berry a spokesman 
for delta air lines where the smoking prohibition applies to about 
70 percent of flights for american its gone extremely 
smoothly said jim brown a spokesman for the airline 
some airlines provided smokers with hard candy or gum to ease 
their cravings 
at times there has been some confusion over what flights might 
be covered by the ban 
united airlines for example allows smoking on westbound 
flights between chicago and philadelphia but prohibits smoking on 
eastbound flights between the same cities because they take less 
than two hours 
but overall said united spokesman dan sheehy its really 
gone very smoothly it wasnt sprung on people there was 
plenty of warning 
the tobacco industry which is asking smokers to wage a campaign 
to restore smoking on all flights also said the first days of the 
ban seemed to have passed without any confrontations

former cbs news president fred friendly on 
wednesday had few good words to say about commercial television 
stations and supported a proposal to impose a fee on these money 
machines to help foot the bill for public broadcasting 
friendly testifying for more than an hour before a senate 
commerce subcommittee said congress has a duty to establish a 
stable source of money for the public tv and radio system it 
created 20 years ago 
he said commercial television has become tragically a money 
machine 
commercial tv makes so much doing its worst that it cant 
afford to do its best said the journalist who headed cbs news 
from 196466 
friendly said the deregulatory climate of the reagan 
administration that has resulted in fewer restrictions on the 
operations of broadcast stations is hurting the viewing public 
you cant go on letting the public airwaves be raped by people 
who dont give a damn about content but only care what they can 
sell the station for in two or three years he said 
friendly a professor emeritus at columbia university graduate 
school of journalism reminded members of the communications 
subcommittee that congress created public broadcasting but 
chastised them for failing to fulfill the promise of providing 
sufficient funds to operate the system adequately 
youve created an illegitimate child he said you have 
disinherited him and made him into a begging pauper 
friendly endorsed a proposal by sen ernest hollings dsc to 
impose a fee of 2 percent to 4 percent of the fair market value of 
a broadcast station upon its sale the higher fee would be imposed 
on stations sold within three years of acquiring the license 
such a fee would raise an estimated 275 million a year which 
would go into a trust fund to support public broadcasting 
commercial broadcasters oppose the proposal edward o fritts 
president of the national association of broadcasters said 
commercial stations free use of the spectrum is a fair exchange 
for their responsibilities to serve the public interest and provide 
free tv service to the public 
hollings added a similar measure to a spending bill last year 
except that the amount of the fee was tied to a stations 
compliance with the fairness doctrine a former federal 
communications commission policy that required broadcasters to air 
opposing views on controversial topics 
the fcc with the reagan administrations support abolished the 
policy last august and since then hollings and other democrats on 
capitol hill have been trying to revive the doctrine 
in a faceoff with president reagan in the waning hours of the 
budget debate last december democrats withdrew their fairness 
measure and the license transfer fees 
this time however hollings is drafting a measure that does not 
include the fairness doctrine and sen robert packwood rore a 
fairness doctrine opponent said the move greatly increases 
chances of passing the bill and of reagan signing it 
packwood however said he remains concerned about creating a 
trust fund that would put public broadcastings funding on 
automatic pilot without the system having to justify use of the 
money 
he warned commercial broadcasters though that some form of 
tax is going to be levied on spectrum users and he advised them 
to help devise a system rather than continue to fight it 
the administration opposes hollings measure and is proposing to 
use competitive bidding to assign licenses to certain portions of 
the radio spectrum the administrations proposal would not apply 
to commercial stations

an unemployed handyman who abused drugs and 
alcohol was convicted wednesday of killing seven women while having 
sex and leaving their bodies to rot in and near his apartment 
common pleas judge robert a latrone convicted harrison 
marty graham who waived a jury trial of seven counts each of 
firstdegree murder and abuse of a corpse latrone scheduled a 
sentencing hearing for thursday morning at which assistant district 
attorney roger king said he would seek the death penalty 
for us tomorrow is life or death said defense attorney 
joel moldovsky we intend to fight for his life 
graham wearing a dark blue jacket and dark blue pants sat 
unmoved during the verdict staring at the judge 
grahams mother lillian seated in the first row of the 
courtroom also sat quietly and refused to comment later 
he deserves everything he gets said camilia deshazor 
parker the mother of one of grahams victims robin deshazor i 
still hate him 
leroy artison the father of another victim sandra garvin 
said the way i feel is that theres nothing that can be done for 
my daughter she is gone 
but he also said i have no hate i have hurt he has to go 
before the international supreme court justice referring to god 
graham 28 did not testify during the trial which started 
march 7 
the bodies were found last aug 9 and 10 after graham was 
evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench police pried 
open a nailed door to find six rotting bodies in grahams bedroom 
leg and foot bones on the roof of his apartment house and a torso 
in the basement of a neighboring house 
graham surrendered to police aug 16 at his mothers urging 
the house is in a druginfested neighborhood where graham was 
known as a handyman 
moldovsky had claimed his client was mentally retarded and did 
not know right from wrong he also said graham might have killed 
the women accidentally or because of drug or alcohol use 
during closing arguments last thursday moldovsky suggested the 
women may have overdosed on drugs or that relatives of grahams 
landlord may have tampered with the murder scene 
but king said moldovskys scenarios were sheer fantasy he 
contended graham knew he was killing the seven women and knew it 
was wrong he called graham a serial killer whose acts were 
willful intentional and premeditated 
in a confession admitted into evidence during the trial graham 
told police the bodies began piling up in his bedroom and he began 
having problems with maggots he also said birds eating body parts 
on his roof made sleeping during the day difficult 
moldovsky had argued the confession was made in violation of 
grahams constitutional rights and that graham was beaten by police 
during 17 hours of interrogation

a commission formed by the major political 
parties said wednesday that four cities have been tentatively 
chosen for presidential debates this fall but that not all 
candidates have yet agreed to take part 
the cities and dates proposed by the 10member commission on 
presidential debates are annapolis md on sept 14 
winstonsalem nc on sept 25 omaha neb on oct 11 and 
pittsburgh on oct 27 
while commitments have not yet been received from allfrom all the 
presidential candidates to debate under the auspices of our 
commission we believe the commission is best situated to 
attract the candidates commission cochairmen paul g kirk and 
frank j fahrenkopf jr democratic and gop chiefs respectively 
said in a joint statement 
the commission has always recognized that the final decisions 
regarding debates lie with the candidates they said 
the parties commission faces competition for control of this 
falls presidential debates from the league of women voters which 
has said it will sponsor three debates of its own 
the league sponsor of debates for the past three presidential 
elections earlier accused the parties of trying to steal the 
debates from the nonprofit organization and argued that 
partysponsored debates would not be free of bias 
the campaign of vice president george bush who clinched the 
republican nomination tuesday has recently taken care to make 
clear it never promised the vice president would take part in any 
specific debates 
weve made no commitment to any particular sponsor forum 
date or location bush campaign spokeswoman alixe glen said 
wednesday obviously he will debate in the fall but we feel its 
premature to be confirming all those specifics 
bush himself when asked wednesday on abctv whether he would 
debate the democratic nominee said absolutely no question 
about it were going to negotiate on format number of debates 
time place all that but absolutely i cant wait 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis matched bushs eagerness 
for a faceoff this fall if and when the vice president agrees to 
debate him 
ive already agreed i dont think he has id be 
delighted the massachusetts governor told reporters wednesday 
i like debating

margaret thatchers government bowing to 
parliamentary revolts within her conservative party announced 
wednesday a string of concessions to help the poor 
opposition labor party legislators howled with derision as 
social services secretary john moore described changes restoring 
housing subsidies to more than 300000 people mainly elderly or 
disabled 
the concessions were aimed partly at stopping conservative 
dissidents from voting in favor of a labor party motion to censure 
the government over proposed welfare changes 
the motion which accused the government of causing 
hardship was later defeated by a vote of 324 to 228 
independent television news said no conservatives voted in favor of 
the motion wednesday night 
the concessions which moore said will cost the government 187 
million a year were widely regarded as the third significant 
aboutface by mrs thatcher in recent months 
the welfare system they the government have introduced has 
proved harsh in its social consequences and embarrassing in its 
political consequences declared opposition social services 
spokesman robin cook 
moore retorted that the government was responding to very 
sensible pressure 
he added nothing could better show the governments 
commitment to those who look to us for help 
the concessions included raising from 11200 to 14960 the 
amount of savings allowed before claimants lose all state housing 
subsidies 
last week conservative rebels slashed to 25 the governments 
101seat majority in the 650member house of commons in a vote on 
proposed changes in property taxation which critics say will be 
unfair to the poorest 
the backdown on housing subsidies followed a recent 15 percent 
pay hike for nurses and extra funding for the financially strapped 
national health service 
critics have charged that mrs thatcher is bent on dismantling 
the state health care system 
legislation altering the welfare system was passed in 1986 but 
the changes took effect just three weeks ago 
since then laborites and newspapers have highlighted individual 
cases of hardship for example cook on wednesday cited the case of 
an elderly widow whose weekly income after having to pay increased 
housing costs fell from 146 to 88 
mrs thatcer has said the welfare reforms which have not cut 
the 86 billion welfare bill are aimed at ending the dependency 
culture and funneling help to the poorest 
but a major aim was to reduce housing subsidies 
critics acknowledge that the changes in welfare payments 
affecting about 8 million people or one in seven britons have 
ended anomalies that often made it more profitable to be on welfare 
than to take a lowpaying job 
senior government sources noted most of the program remained 
intact but acknowledged mrs thatcher made the concessions because 
of worry among rankandfile legislators 
when you are doing all these things that intimately touch the 
lives of all 55 million inhabitants of britain then quite clearly 
you can understand that there is some uneasiness said a senior 
government source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the proposed property tax changes under which taxes will be 
levied against each adult in a home instead of the residence face 
possible defeat this summer in the unelected house of lords but 
the lords can at most only delay measures for up to six months 
legislation providing for the new tax system completed a stormy 
passage through the commons last week 
the government slashed the top tax rate this month from 60 
percent to 40 percent 
polls show mrs thatchers lead over labor narrowing but she 
remains about five points ahead of labor in most recent opinion 
polls

authorities investigating rapes and 
murders in at least five states are trying to unravel the life of a 
53yearold suburban pittsburgh businessman who committed suicide 
during a confrontation with police 
pennsylvania authorities are scheduled to meet this week with 
other police agencies to share evidence in their investigation of 
gary alan robbins a murrysville real estate and insurance salesman 
who was charged in 1971 with armed robbery in an ohio assault 
robbins shot himself to death april 14 during a confrontation 
with a pennsylvania state trooper in somerset county according to 
authorities 
less than an hour earlier robbins allegedly had tried to enter 
the brothers valley township home of mary marker 42 wife of state 
trooper david marker and allegedly shot her in the face with a 
handgun according to authorities the woman was able to call state 
police 
since the shooting police have been trying to determine if 
robbins had a role in various unsolved crimes during the past 
several years in pennsylvania maryland ohio michigan and iowa 
with which he has thus far been only loosely connected according 
to the pittsburgh postgazette 
authorities are rechecking the details of the torture and rape 
of a butler woman in 1985 the killing of a woman in reed city 
mich the rape of one woman and the killing of another near 
baltimore and the killing of a woman in chester wva in july 
according to the newspaper 
pennsylvania police also have received inquiries from mayfield 
village ohio and burlington iowa where murders of women fit the 
same pattern of an encounter with a short welldressed man with 
glasses who was involved with real estate sales the newspaper 
reported in each case he blindfolded his victims muzzled them 
with duct tape and tied them up with cord 
if he is the one theyre looking for now im glad hes dead 
not only for what he did to me and my daughter but what he did to 
others dorothy barkley of tallmadge ohio an early victim of 
robbins recently told the newspaper 
mrs barkley said robbins came to her suburban akron home in 
february 1970 identifying himself as a chicago doctor who was 
reclocating in the area and wanted to look at her home which was 
for sale 
she said robbins produced a handgun and forced her and her 
13yearold daughter into their basement where he blindfolded and 
bound them with tape and cord 
he was sweating and angry shouting at me constantly as he 
tied my hands and legs together behind my back she recalled she 
didnt resist robbins because he told me he would kill us both 
she said 
police said robbins did not molest or harm the woman or her 
daughter he took 5 from a purse and took several lace 
handkerchiefs before fleeing 
police said robbins was charged in 1971 with armed robbery in 
the 1970 incident with the barkleys and confessed to somewhat 
similar cases in youngstown salem and alliance ohio he pleaded 
guilty to assaulting the barkleys in exchange for five years 
probation with stipulations that he undergo continuous 
psychiatric counseling 
robbins who then lived in beaver pa told police he had 
deeprooted sexual problems 
tallmadge police lt donald drum said ohio authorities agreed to 
drop some of the charges against robbins because they viewed him as 
being mentally ill not criminal alliance police lt forrest barber 
agreed 
i think everyone allowed him to walk on these crimes because 
his psychiatrist at the time testified that he was undergoing some 
type of surrogate sex therapy and was going to be all right but i 
guess therapy might not have worked barber said 
during the rest of the 1970s court records in beaver and 
allegheny counties reveal no criminal or financial problems for 
robbins according to the postgazette police surmise that the 
intensive treatment he was receiving was working it reported 
in 1985 robbins agreed to forfeit his real estate license after 
admitting the theft of 10000 in down payments from prospective 
home buyers and in 1986 he was jailed over child support payments

hoarding by moonshiners and by consumers who fear 
a price increase is forcing sugarloving soviets to line up for 
hours to buy a product more plentiful here than anywhere else in 
the world 
sugar which was in constant supply for years when many other 
foods were hard to get has disappeared from store shelves from the 
western ukraine to siberia the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said 
wednesday 
the shortage could seriously embarrass soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev for two reasons he promised to improve food supplies to 
soviet consumers and he is responsible for tightening liquor 
supplies which encouraged moonshining 
a middleaged moscow woman said that tuesday afternoon for the 
first time she could recall she could not find sugar at several of 
her local food stores 
its as if a sugar fever has gripped the country in recent 
months komsomolskaya pravda said 
the soviet union produces more sugar than any other country in 
the world and increased its production by 10 percent in the first 
quarter of 1988 over a similar period in 1987 the newspaper said 
but demand for sugar increased by 22 percent in estonia 27 
percent in the ukraine and 63 percent in moldavia it said 
residents of kiev the ukrainian capital say stores have 
limited their hours for selling sugar to keep people from 
surrounding areas from coming into kiev and buying up the supply 
a western reporter who visited krasnodar in southern russian in 
early april saw at least 20 people lined up to buy sugar at a store 
that limited its hours 
in some areas sugar is rationed to one kilogram 22 pounds per 
person a month komsomolskaya pravda said 
it said readers complained people must start standing in line at 
6 am to buy sugar in some places and that elsewhere stores can 
only sell sugar to the first 200 people in a line of 500 
komsomolskaya pravda blamed the sugar fever on moonshiners 
who need it to produce alcohol people trying to accumulate stocks 
because of rumors of impending price increases and black marketeers 
trading in the white gold 
one reader i osintseva from the tambov region of central 
russia wrote that the price of a sack of sugar on the black market 
was more than her monthly salary 
but all the moonshiners buy it by the sack its 
profitable the paper said 
soviet officials have denied in the official press any plans to 
increase prices 
since gorbachev decreed an antidrinking campaign in may 1985 
moonshining has been on the rise to counter lowered production of 
vodka and spirits and higher prices in state stores 
in a meeting with farm workers last year gorbachev blamed the 
sugar shortage on moonshiners but said soviets eat far too much 
sugar anyhow an average of more than 40 kilograms 88 pounds a 
year about twice what americans eat 
many soviets add large amounts of sugar to their coffee or tea 
and serve it with cake or candy 
last year more than 10000 soviets died from drinking home brew 
or spirits and more than 500000 people nationwide were punished 
for moonshining 
economist nikolai shmelev said in an article in the april 
edition of the literary journal novy mir that gorbachevs 
antialcohol campaign was a total failure because it took money 
from alcohol sales out of the hands of the government and gave it 
to moonshiners 
komsomolskaya pravda said moonshiners had to be punished 
severely it said its readers also wanted order restored in the 
sale of sugar 
but it also suggested that the governments antidrinking 
campaign should be modified to cut down on moonshining 
its necessary to remove the causes that have provoked mass 
moonshining in the first place the endless lines at wine stores 
the newspaper said

tawana brawley will ignore a monday deadline 
issued by a state grand jury seeking her testimony and will tell 
her story to the public if no federal investigation is launched an 
adviser to her family said wednesday 
there is no way she will cooperate with bob abrams grand 
jury the rev al sharpton said referring to state attorney 
general robert abrams 
gov mario cuomo appointed abrams as a special prosecutor for 
the brawley case after the black teenager said she was a victim of 
a sexual and racial assault involving six white men one of whom 
flashed a policelike badge 
they can take whatever legal steps they want said sharpton 
who along with miss brawleys lawyers alton maddox jr and c 
vernon mason has presented the case as a civil rights issue 
unless there is an impartial federal grand jury ms brawley 
will not go and stand up in front of a bogus grand jury that has 
sought to protect immunize and sanitize her assailants 
he said the grand jury had written to miss brawley and her 
mother glenda asking the youngster to come forward and warning 
that the panel could take action to try to force her to tell her 
story if she refuses to cooperate 
the poughkeepsie journal reported wednesday that the letter 
contained a monday deadline 
its dumb glenda brawley of wappingers falls near 
poughkeepsie said of the grand jurys appeal weve been through 
all this before what makes them think were going to all of a 
sudden bring tawana down there and talk to them 
mrs brawley reaffirmed the pledges by the family and their 
lawyers that they will go to jail rather than force her to 
cooperate with the grand jury 
if a federal grand jury is set up she will cooperate with 
that or she will go public we still affirm those two 
options sharpton said 
abrams spokesman timothy gilles refused to comment saying 
grand jury matters must be kept secret 
miss brawley was found on nov 28 after a fourday 
disappearance huddled in a trash bag with racial slurs scrawled on 
her torso and feces smeared on her body

former vice president spiro t agnew has 
filed a 2 million federal lawsuit alleging that a 
telecommunications firm cheated him out of consulting fees for 
arranging a contract with the argentine military 
agnews suit also accused aydin corporation of fraud conspiracy 
to defraud and racketeering alleging that company officials 
promised argentine officials bribes and illegal kickbacks to secure 
a telecommunications contract with the argentine government in 1982 
agnew who now runs a marylandbased international consulting 
firm called pathlite inc charged that the firm did not pay him 
for introducing company officials to the military leaders who ran 
the country from 1976 to 1983 
the introductions enabled aydin to become a qualified bidder and 
eventually to win the contract according to the 37page complaint 
filed tuesday in us district court in philadelphia aydin had 
agreed to compensate agnew from the proceeds made on any contracts 
that resulted from agnews introduction the complaint said 
however ronald kidd a lawyer for aydin said there was 
absolutely no agreement at any time between aydin and agnew 
agnew filed a similar lawsuit in 1986 in federal court in new 
york against alicanto sa an argentine company that agnew said 
acted as the agent for aydin in the dealings with the military 
leaders in that suit agnew charged that alicanto had refused to 
pay him from a commission it was to receive from aydin 
on monday the us supreme court rejected an order sought by 
the plaintiffs in the 1986 suit to set aside about 340000 in 
alicantos assets attorneys said the money was sought to protect 
agnew and a coplaintiff in the case former alicanto vice 
president william woolverton jr if alicanto lost the 1986 suit 
and moved its assets out of the united states 
in each suit agnew said he was owed more than 2 million for his 
services each suit seeks triple that amount 6165 million or 
the 2055 million agnew says he is owed plus 5 million in 
punitive damages said his lawyer robert p knapp jr 
aydin a delaware corporation with headquarters in horsham 
employs more than 2000 workers and specializes in the manufacture 
and installation of largescale communications systems 
agnew the only vice president to resign in us history left 
office in 1973 just before pleading no contest to federal charges 
of tax evasion on 29500 he received in 1967 while governor of 
maryland agnew had been elected governor in 1966 
since returning to private life the former vice president has 
been chief executive officer of pathlite providing introductions 
for us companies interested in gaining international contracts

a highly contagious viral disease in poultry 
and other fowl has been found in pet birds in michigan and nevada 
the agriculture department said wednesday 
no domestic poultry has been affected by the outbreak said 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service 
but laboratory tests confirmed exotic newcastle disease in a 
threeweekold spectacled amazon parrot and in a young yellownaped 
parrot owned by private individuals he said 
the birds and a number of others that were exposed to the 
infected birds were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease 
glosser said the birds premises in west bloomfield mich and 
las vegas nev were placed under state quarantines federal and 
state authorities are tracing the disease to determine if 
additional birds or premises may have been exposed 
exotic newcastle disease can cause death rates of 50 percent to 
95 percent in poultry flocks officials say the disease poses no 
risk to humans who eat poultry or eggs but in some cases people 
who handle infected birds can contract the virus which in humans 
causes temporary eye inflammation and mild flulike symptoms 
the most serious outbreak in the united states was in southern 
california in the early 1970s where the disease spread from 
infected pet birds to commercial poultry nearly 12 million birds 
mostly egglaying hens were destroyed at a cost of 56 million 
before the the disease was eradicated

fourfifths of the nations privately owned 
housing for the poor could be lost in the next 15 years through 
owners defaulting on mortgage payments or paying off mortgages 
early to get around federal restrictions a commission warned 
wednesday 
to counter that trend the national lowincome housing 
preservation commission recommended spending an additional 113 
billion over the 15 years to keep owners from converting the 
housing into highrent apartments or condominiums and to help 
owners who are having trouble making mortgage payments an 
additional 64 billion would go toward continuing federal 
subsidies 
everyone talks about the homeless as the tip of the iceberg 
said linda parke gallagher executive director of the bipartisan 
commission we have described the iceberg we can see the crisis 
coming 
in a report called preventing the disappearance of lowincome 
housing prepared for the house and senate subcommittees on 
housing the commission generally takes the tack that preserving 
and even fixing up the current privately owned housing for the 
poor is cheaper than building new housing 
the average cost of saving a defaulting unit is 24000 
gallagher said the average cost of building new housing is 
70000 a unit 
most of the housing for the poor was built in the 1960s and 
early 1970s the problem of owner defaults is not new nor is the 
problem of increasing real estate values in big cities which puts 
pressure on owners of lowincome housing to prepay their mortgages 
and convert to more lucrative highrent apartments or condominiums 
but the commission concludes that both trends will accelerate in 
the next decade as federal rent subsidy contracts expire 
adding to the problem is the new federal income tax law which 
removed many of the tax incentives for investing in such housing 
the report said 
the commission specifically looked at properties subsidized by 
the department of housing and urban development with mortgages 
insured by the federal housing administration that amounts to 
about 645000 units 
unless the federal government takes a more active role owners 
of 43 percent or 280000 units will default and an additional 
38 percent representing 243000 units will prepay their 
mortgages in the next 15 years the commission said in its report 
everyone dealing with the project was surprised at the 
projected level of default gallagher said add that together 
with the prepayments and we see the number of units of lowincome 
housing going steadily downward 
we knew we had a problem but we were surprised at the depth of 
it 
thomas demery assistant secretary for housing and federal 
housing commissioner in hud said he supports the commissions 
basic premise that it is better to preserve existing housing for 
the poor rather than build new housing he said he also foresees 
the same troubles for the privately owned lowincome housing 
i share their concern and their desire to do something 
demery said their report is an excellent starting point

federal quarantine restrictions to prevent the 
further spread of tiny bee mites have been reduced in mississippi 
and washington the agriculture department said wednesday 
however the tiny killer mites varroa jacobsoni still remain 
a potential threat to the us bee industry officials said all or 
parts of 13 states remain under federal quarantine restrictions 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the revision for mississippi 
and washington retains only that portion of each state that must 
be quarantined to keep the varroa mite from spreading 
glosser said the statewide quarantine in mississippi was reduced 
to parts of adams franklin and wilkinson counties while the 
washington quarantine area was reduced to part of klickitat county 
varroa mites were discovered in the united states last september 
in a wisconsin apiary since then they have been found in 12 other 
states florida illinois maine michigan mississippi nebraska 
new york ohio pennsylvania south carolina south dakota and 
washington 
the original federal quarantine went into effect april 6 and 
restricted the interstate movement of bees and bee equipment from 
all 13 states 
glosser said the change in the original quarantine was partly 
because both mississippi and washington are enforcing restrictions 
on the movement of bees and bee equipment within their own borders 
we also have determined that the interstate spread of varroa 
mite from mississippi and washington will be controlled by 
maintaining the quarantine in those portions of both states that 
include all known infested apiaries as well as a border of about 
100 square miles surrounding each infested apiary he said 
the mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae or brood it causes decreased brood deformed 
bees and a weakening of the colonys ability o pollinate plants and 
produce honey infestation can occur so gradually that the mites 
may not be noticed until severe damage is done

president reagan congratulated george bush 
wednesday for clinching the republican presidential nomination but 
stopped short of a public endorsement meanwhile sources said 
reagan would strictly limit his role at the august convention to 
avoid stealing bushs thunder 
administration and party sources made the comments one day after 
bushs victory in the pennsylvania primary pushed him past the 
1139 delegates needed for nomination at the republican national 
convention in new orleans 
reagan will address the convention on opening night monday 
aug 15 but will not give the keynote address said one source 
commenting only on condition of anonymity 
that would vary the normal order for such conventions the 
source said but i think the presidents view is that this is 
going to be a convention for the next nominee of the republican 
party its the presidents view that wherever he goes he tends to 
be the focal point so he wants to do it this way 
reagan would leave for his california ranch on tuesday morning 
the source said 
another source said that there has been discussion of a reagan 
televised address to the convention on the night bush accepts the 
nomination but that no decisions have been made 
at the white house reagan said he was leaning toward endorsing 
bush but he said let us see when pressed by reporters to say 
when he would formally embrace bushs candidacy 
well im going to have to arrive at that since there are no 
others entering the president told reporters during an oval 
office picturetaking session with canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney 
during an interview taped for cable news networks inside 
politics 88 show wednesday night bush said weve got to 
discuss that whether it will be some formal endorsement 
but when there will be some formal endorsement ceremony we 
didnt have any agreement on that bush said in the interview 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there should be no 
doubt about reagans intentions although the president did not 
renounce the neutral stance he took at the outset of the primary 
season 
during a private lunch with bush reagan congratulated him on 
passing the magic number they discussed the political strategy the 
vice president will employ fitzwater said 
the spokesman said reagan and bush discussed a joint campaign 
appearance sometime soon and for the president to campaign for 
the vice president and for them to appear together would amount to 
an endorsement 
reagan has spoken warmly of bush several times in recent months 
but still has refused to break his vow of neutrality reagan has 
publicly called bush the best vice president in memory 
asked whether reagans remarks wednesday were tantamount to an 
endorsement fitzwater replied to me that seems fair although 
technically they are reluctant to do that but i dont why maybe 
because somebody might enter the race or something like that but 
for all practical purposes it does represent an endorsement 
reagan tossed in a plug for bush during a recent speech before 
the american society of newspaper editors convention here 
during the course of a wideranging speech and just before he 
began taking questions from editors reagan said the administration 
had made progress in fighting the flow of drugs into this country 
and let me say if you want to see effective leadership take 
a look at vice president bushs role in this the president said 
while others talked about leading the military into the fray 
against drugs the vice president has led 
reagans reference was to bushs chairmanship of a 
druginterdiction task force

the soviet union and its allies have a 
substantially greater capability to win a war in europe than 
nato according to a pentagon assessment which one senator said 
wednesday raises a new warning flag 
there is an imbalance in conventional weapons in europe and 
theres absolutely no doubt about it said sen dan quayle 
rind this is something that were going to have to consider as 
we debate the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty next 
month 
quayle based his comments on portions of the annual pentagon 
publication soviet military power which will be formally made 
public friday by the defense department 
some sections of the report have already been sent to capitol 
hill including the part which restates earlier comments by 
pentagon officials 
those officials as part of the senate hearings on the inf pact 
have warned that the north atlantic treaty organization needs to 
spend more money on nonnuclear weapons 
the assessment in soviet military power released by quayle 
said the warsaw pact has improved in a number of areas and now has 
growing leads over nato in a variety of weapons including numbers 
of tanks and artillery 
the conclusion of the inf treaty has heightened public 
awareness in the west of continuing imbalances and persisting 
deficiencies in certain critical categories of natos conventional 
forces the publication said 
the inf treaty will require both nations to eliminate all 
missiles with a range of 300 to 3400 miles 
the senate is expected to consider it next month and when it 
finally votes ratification is likely since leaders of both parties 
say 90 or more senators are expected to vote for it ratification 
requires the approval of 67 of the 100 senators 
the assessment also warned that although the soviet union is 
narrowing the technological gap the united states and its allies 
maintain the technological lead 
this lead will continue to diminish however unless the us 
maintains strong safeguards against the soviets sophisticated 
efforts to acquire technology the report forecast 
the united states still has advantages in a number of 
technological areas the report noted including biochemical 
technology computing capability some areas of directed energy 
and electronic materials and integratedcircuit manufacturing 
while the west leads in a number of research areas the 
soviets are methodically and efficiently transitioning new 
technologies into their vast arsenal oftentimes more rapidly than 
the west the report said 
the soviets already hold quantitative advantages and are now 
seeking better weapon system quality it said consequently 
the comparative technological level of deployed soviet systems is 
gradually improving this situation is the result of their forced 
application of technology in shorter development cycles than are 
typical in the west 
it also notes that the soviets may soon begin limited 
operational deployment of some stealth technologies the term 
used by the air force to describe a new generation of planes which 
are designed to be virtually invisible to radars 
the air force has said that its new stealth bomber will 
begin testing in the fall and there have been reports never 
formally confirmed by the service that the air force is also 
building a stealth fighter

the reagan administration and the oil industry 
won another victory over environmentalists wednesday as a house 
subcommittee voted to allow petroleum development in the arctic 
national wildlife refuge 
by a 179 vote the merchant marine subcommittee on fisheries 
and wildlife conservation and the environment approved legislation 
to authorize the interior department to sell oil leases on the 15 
million acre coastal plain of the refuge in northeastern alaska 
the issue has provoked a major struggle in the 100th congress 
between enviromentalists who want no drilling in the refuge and 
the administration and oil industry who say the plains 
potentially large reserves are needed to stem a growing national 
dependence on imported oil 
an interior department study says development can be carried out 
in an environmentally sound manner and could produce oil to rival 
the prudhoe bay complex about 70 miles to the west prudhoe bay 
accounts for about 20 percent of us production 
the victory in the subcommittee was the second straight for 
drilling advocates and is expected to be duplicated next week when 
the full merchant marine committee considers the proposal by its 
chairman rep walter jones dnc 
earlier this year the senate energy and natural resources 
committee voted 118 to allow oil rigs onto the refuge where 
opponents say development would spoil its pristine character and 
damage wildlife habitat the senate bill is awaiting floor debate 
jones plan would allow phased leasing with the first sale to 
occur no sooner than 21 months after enactment no more than 
300000 acres could be leased at sales occurring no more frequently 
than every two years 
the bill would bar surface development in a 260000 acre area 
that contains about 90 percent of the land used for calving by the 
180000head porcupine caribou herd which migrates between alaska 
and canada 
the refuge administration act of 1966 requires that development 
in such enclaves be compatible with the basic purpose of a refuge 
preserving wildlife habitat 
it is up to developers to convince officials of compatibility 
jones bill however would force opponents of developing the 
coastal plain to prove that such activity would have significant 
and adverse longterm effects on habitat 
the bill would prohibit export of any petroleum extracted from 
the coastal plain and would require any ocean transport of this oil 
to be done on ships registered in the united states 
the legislation also would create a new 235 millionacre 
teshekpukutukok national wildlife refuge to the west of prudhoe 
bay and place a fiveyear moratorium on any petroleum leasing in 
the new refuge 
drilling opponents repeatedly failed in attempts to amend the 
bill 
the merchant marine committee is only the first hurdle drilling 
legislation faces in the house at least one other committee 
interior has jurisdiction over the issue

the wildlife death toll from shell oils 
175000gallon spill rose wednesday to at least 130 birds and 
dozens of small animals as the thick crude oozed through fragile 
coastal wetlands 
larry kolb principal engineer of the state regional water 
quality control board called saturdays spill during the nesting 
season an ecological disaster in which damaged areas may take a 
year or more to recover 
the audubon society an environmental group said the worsthit 
marshes flanking peyton slough just below the shell refinery 
might take decades to recover 
the size of the spill was revised upward tuesday as waterborne 
skimmers and vacuum pumps working day and night recovered about 
44000 gallons said brian hunter regional manager of the state 
department of fish and game 
shell initially estimated 21000 gallons escaped through a 
damaged drain atop a shell holding tank 
hunter said 130 birds were dead including some of about 400 
rescued for cleaning at least two dozen turtles marsh mice and 
muskrats were also found dead 
coast guard helicopters assisted in spotting the unrefined oil 
which on wednesday stretched in pockets and spotty concentrations 
some 12 miles from ryer island east through carquinez strait and 
1 miles into san pablo bay 
more than 100 workers raced against natural deadlines to clean 
up the area on saturday an exceptionally high tide of 55 feet 
will spread whatever oil is left and predicted rain also could 
slosh the goo into clear water kolb said 
officials of the state department of fish and game expressed 
concern the oil might contaminate grizzly bay the bay is typically 
calm and warm making it a major incubator for fish and plants 
kolb said the spill could cost shell which has acknowledged 
responsibility 3 million or more in penalties in addition to 1 
million for the cleanup and hundreds of thousands of dollars for 
refinishing oildamaged boat bottoms

the federal communications commission has 
formally scrapped an unpopular proposal that would have raised 
telephone charges substantially for computer users 
in its order the fcc concluded this is not an appropriate 
time to levy interstate access charges on providers of 
information services because the industry is in a uniquely 
complex period of transition 
the commission which voted last week on the action and released 
the text of its order wednesday is considering plans by the local 
bell telephone companies to give equal access to information 
providers these plans could change the way information services 
are provided over the local networks 
it would be prudent to defer consideration of our proposal 
until we are more certain of the effects of the bell companies 
interconnection plans the fcc said 
the agencys plan would have added about 450 an hour to the 
cost for a computer user to link up electronically with an 
information provider that cost would more than double the hourly 
hookup price for some data bases 
the fcc proposal would have extended to computer users the same 
access charges now paid by longdistance companies for access to 
the local phone network the longdistance companies pass these 
charges along to callers in their rates 
the agency when it adopted the longdistance access charges in 
1982 exempted information service providers from the fees because 
of the fear that the new industry would not withstand the sudden 
increase in costs 
the commission found virtually no support for its plan computer 
users said the increased costs would drive many of them off the 
computer networks and crush a fledgling industry 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house 
telecommunications subcommittee said in a statement the fccs 
action will remove a serious threat to the health of the enhanced 
services industry

no hard feelings but veterans groups 
dont want soviet students marching in the memorial day parade next 
month even if it does fall during sovietamerican friendship week 
the parades organizers said wednesday 
about 20 members of the greenfield patriotic societies voted in 
a show of hands last week against letting 10 young soviet visitors 
march in the may 30 parade the group which sponsors the parade 
is a coalition of eigth veterans organizations 
coalition president mark fitzpatrick who was recently hired by 
this town of 18000 in northwestern massachusetts to help local 
veterans said the nearly unanimous vote reflected the personal 
feelings of those who fought against sovietaided enemies in the 
korean and vietnam wars 
there is no political statement made from this vote said 
fitzpatrick there is nothing other than a feeling that it is 
inappropriate for these kids to march 
fitzpatrick said the request to allow the teenagers to march 
was made by jennifer shikes who is coordinating their weeklong 
trip to the region for the traprock peace center in nearby 
deerfield 
shikes said she accepted the veterans decision adding that she 
realized only after making the request that the greenfield parade 
was predominantly for veterans not for all community groups a 
lot of the points brought up were well taken she said 
the students will be in the united states on an exchange program 
sponsored by international arts for peace that will also take them 
to boston and new york in honor of their visit greenfield 
selectmen voted to declare the week a time of friendship between 
the two superpowers 
international arts for peace is a nonprofit international 
student exchange organization based in brookline 
one of the purposes of the visit is for the soviet students to 
work with a group of american teenagers to write a peace statement 
to be delivered to the united nations in june shikes said the 
traprock center contacted the brookline group about serving as host 
for the western massachusetts leg of the visit 
the students will be staying in private homes in and around 
greenfield 
local veterans pointed out that at least 20 events have been 
planned in the county just for the visit including a barbeque and 
pizza party 
i love kids i work with them all the time its just the 
idea said william phelps commander of american legion post 81 
who was a green beret in the vietnam war let them have their own 
little parade but not on memorial day 
william peloskey commander of the veterans of foreign wars john 
f harrington post 417 agreed 
personally i have mixed emotions for the simple reason that 
theyre kids said pelosky who served in the pacific in world 
war ii when the soviet union was a us ally 
but he added as far as the unit is concerned because we have 
so many veterans from various wars definitely we will not let the 
youngsters march with us

the united states has told canada it wont 
agree to bar increases in northbound flow of nitrogen oxides an 
important cause of acid rain an environmental protection agency 
official said wednesday 
in united nationssponsored negotiations in geneva the united 
states is seeking the right to emit about 20 percent more nitrogen 
oxides than it now does said sheldon meyers epas acting 
associate administrator for international programs 
meyers said the united states wants credit for earlier 
unilateral efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions a 1979 
treaty calls for reductions in crossborder flows of air pollution 
taking into account the efforts already made 
the united states refused to seek such a credit in another treat 
last fall aimed at safeguarding the earths protective ozone layer 
the 20 percent increase in nitrogen oxide emissions would be 
compensation for the efforts and achievements of the existing us 
control program which has reduced groundlevel concentrations of 
nitrogen oxides by 14 percent since 1975 and emissions by 85 
percent since 1978 meyers said 
nitrogen oxide an important component of auto emissions later 
turns into nitric acid in the atmosphere and along with sulfuric 
acid from sulfur dioxide emissions creates the acid rain which 
environmentalists blame for the death of aquatic life in sensitive 
lakes and streams 
theres no question that absent our control program we would 
have much higher nitrogen oxide emissions and the united states 
believes other countries should catch up before it undertakes new 
commitments meyers said 
earlier negotiations resulted in international agreement in 1985 
to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 30 percent an agreement the 
united states has declined to join 
both sulfur and nitrogen oxides are emitted by coalburning 
power plants and factory boilers in the eastern united states and 
canada sulfur accounts for twothirds of the excess acidity in 
rainfall and has been believed more damaging to lakes and streams 
half of canadas acid rain originates in the united states and 
canada for years has pressed for additional us action against the 
precursors of acid rain 
due to auto emission standards imposed in the united states in 
1975 a new car today emits only onefourth the nitrogen oxides of 
cars made before that canada adopted us auto emission standards 
in 1985 and most european countries are only beginning to 
contemplate such controls 
but us emissions are expected to increase again around 1995 
because of more travel by more cars thus meyers said theres 
no way we can agree to a canadian proposal to accept the us 
position permitting higher emissions in exchange for a commitment 
not to increase crossborder flow of nitrogen oxides 
in fact said meyers the united states does not believe such 
flows can be measured canada he said uses a computer model 
we say is not accurate its very simplistic 
during talks leading up to the september international treaty 
calling for a 50 percent reduction in emissions of 
chlorofluorocarbon compounds that attack the ozone layer us 
negotiators declined to seek credit for emissions reductions 
resulting from the 1978 us ban on use of these chemicals as 
aerosol propellants 
the cfc negotiations were not comparable meyers said the 1978 
aerosol reductions were minor these nitrogen oxide reductions 
are not minor 
canada also has sought a treaty with the united states limiting 
us sulfur dioxide exports to 22 million tons compared with 
about 4 million tons today the united states has not agreed 
according to epa estimates the united states emitted 213 
million tons of nitrogen oxides in 1986 and 233 million tons in 
1978 the peak year canadian emissions were 9 percent of the us 
total in 1980 epa expects us emissions in the year 2000 to be 
above 22 million tons 
meyers revelation drew this criticism from rep james florio 
dnj a member of the house energy and commerce committee 
considering for the fifth straight year various measures against 
acid rain 
for too long the administration has talked about research when 
it was clear that what was needed was action now they are talking 
about increasing by 4 million tons a year the amount of nitrogen 
oxide that is released into the air it simply does not make 
sense

three of five nuclear regulatory commission 
members favor doing away with their own jobs and replacing the 
panel with a single administrator the agencys chairman said 
wednesday 
nrc chairman lando zech told the senate governmental affairs 
committee that he and two other commissioners believe a single 
administrator would enhance responsibility and accountability at 
the top of the agency 
we are before you in a sense recommending that our jobs be 
eliminated zech said the commission is functioning in a very 
good manner we simply think it could function a lot better were 
frustrated as you can tell 
nrc commissioner frederick bernthal said the current system is 
tying us in knots 
it leads to fragmented and ultimately flawed decisions said 
bernthal in my judgment the principle of checks and balances 
must be reintroduced and accountability has to be restored in 
order to remedy the situation 
commissioner thomas roberts also supports the idea of a new 
administrator but commissioners kenneth carr and kenneth rogers 
oppose it officials for the agency said 
a bill by sens john breaux dla and alan simpson rwyo 
would replace the nrc with a nuclear safety agency structured much 
like the environmental protection agency 
the new agency would be headed by a single presidentially 
appointed administrator who must be confirmed by the senate 
the legislation also would establish an independent inspector 
general to review allegations of fraud and abuse and a safety board 
to investigate accidents at nuclear power plants 
breaux said there is a crying need to reorganize the nrc in 
order to rebuild the confidence of the american people 
up to 90 percent of the commissions decisions are made without 
the commissioners even meeting together simpson said 
the notion of collegial decisionmaking is a myth an absolute 
myth he said 
the general accounting office also had endorsed the idea of 
abolishing the commission in favor an agency headed by one person 
instead of five 
dexter peach assistant comptroller general for the gao said a 
single administrator could respond more quickly and efficiently to 
daytoday regulatory problems and decisions 
zech said the commission does not oppose a nuclear safety board 
in a singleadministrator agency as long it remains part of the 
agency he said the commission also has no objection to a 
congressionally required inspector general for the nrc

george bush the apparent republican presidential nominee and 
his likely democratic opponent michael dukakis set a combative tone 
for the campaign wednesday with dukakis saying bush has some 
explaining to do on the irancontra affair 
let him fire away bush challenged 
both said they looked forward to debates 
the other democrat still in the race jesse jackson gamely 
looked ahead to the next round of primaries in ohio and indiana 
despite dukakis huge victory in pennsylvania on tuesday and 
growing delegate lead jackson said the race wasnt over 
i keep struggling against the odds and ive always struggled 
against the odds and succeeded jackson said on abctv this 
campaign will remain alive it will go right down to the wire in 
california and new jersey on june 7 
bush locked up the republican nomination passing the required 
1139delegate mark with an easy win in pennsylvania against a 
field that had long since withered 
he lunched privately with president reagan who indicated the 
time was nearing for a formal endorsement of his vice president 
administration and republican party sources meanwhile said 
reagan planned to strictly limit his role at the republican 
national convention in new orleans in august to avoid stealing 
bushs thunder 
reagan will address the convention on opening night monday 
aug 15 then leave the next day for california according to 
sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
both bush and dukakis said they would continue their 
primarycampaign efforts but they were already providing a preview 
of the fall general election campaign with a longdistance debate 
on foreign policy and other issues through network tv interviews 
dukakis the massachusetts governor opened fire on bushs role 
in the irancontra affair bush has suggested he would be a better 
choice as president because he has foreign policy experience that 
dukakis lacks 
the governor said all we know is that he sat there and did 
nothing while we engaged in one of the worst and one of the most 
misguided adventures in the history of american foreign policy a 
reference of the armsforhostages dealing directed by white house 
officials 
i cant imagine what they were thinking of when they proceeded 
to do business with a terrorist nation dukakis added theres 
somebody in the administration including the vice president whos 
got some explaining to do 
bush said he would ask dukakis in debate what he would do about 
hostages in the middle east do you really care when a man like 
buckley is being tortured to death he said he would ask a 
reference to william buckley the cia official who died after being 
taken hostage in lebanon 
bush said he would continue to campaign in the remaining gop 
primaries despite his clinching of the nomination i dont want 
to project an overconfidence or an arrogance that i dont feel 
he said 
he said he absolutely no question about it would debate the 
democratic nominee 
dukakis said ive already agreed to i dont think he has 
id be delighted i like debating 
at the same time a commission formed by the major political 
parties revealed plans for four debates between sept 14 and oct 
27 
while commitments have not yet been received from all the 
presidential candidates to debate under the auspices of our 
commission we believe the commission is best situated to 
attract the candidates commission cochairmen paul g kirk and 
frank j fahrenkopf jr democratic and gop chiefs respectively 
said in a joint statement 
the parties commission faces competition for control of this 
falls presidential debates from the league of women voters which 
has said it will sponsor three debates of its own 
 
jackson campaigning in ohio took on both men on an issue he 
has tried to bring to the forefront of the campaign i challenge 
mike dukakis and george bush to define south africa as a terrorist 
state that conducts and sponsors terrorism he said 
talk in both parties was of vice presidential nominees 
jackson appeared to indicate that conservative sen sam nunn of 
georgia supported for the ticket by many democratic leaders might 
not be acceptable he mentioned no names and framed his comments in 
terms of a running mate for himself making what seemed to be a 
reference to nunns opposition to some civil rights legislation and 
to the equal rights amendement 
whoever i would have on my ticket would have to have a good 
record in civil rights womens rights social justice and a real 
pronounced commitment to peace in this world jackson said 
dukakis called it too early to think about jackson or anyone 
else for a running mate 
bush suggested he saw no need to announce a running mate before 
the republican convention in august i want to watch and see what 
the democrats do he said 
arkansas gov bill clinton a dukakis ally said nunn or florida 
sen bob graham would be great on the ticket with dukakis and 
also suggested the name of arkansas sen dale bumpers 
asked about himself as a running mate clinton said in an 
interview i guess i could help him in the south and sing a good 
song but i think my hunch is hed be better off with a senator 
and i think thats what hell end up doing

americans personal incomes boosted by 
profitsharing payments in the auto industry posted the biggest 
gain last month since december while consumer spending jumped a 
healthy 07 percent the government reported wednesday 
the commerce department said personal incomes climbed 08 
percent in march after a 06 percent gain in february it was the 
best increase since an identical 08 percent advance in december 
analysts said spending and income figures showed that the 
consumer who cut back on purchases immediately following the 
october stock market crash had rebounded and was continuing to 
propel overall economic growth 
in reporting tuesday on the gross national product the 
government said the consumer was the biggest source of strength 
during the first three months of the year consumer spending rose 
at an annual rate of 38 percent after adjusting for inflation 
during the quarter 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity had declined by 25 percent in the final three 
months of 1987 raising fears that if americans stopped spending 
especially for bigticket items the nation could be pushed into a 
recession 
there is no serious consumer retrenchment going on people are 
still willing to buy said sandra shaber an economist with the 
futures group an economic forecasting firm in washington we 
shouldnt face any serious problem of a spending slump for the rest 
of the year 
ms shaber predicted that consumer spending would rise at a 
modest 2 percent annual rate for the entire year about the same as 
in 1987 
the 08 percent march increase in incomes would have been a much 
smaller 02 percent if special factors including an annual bonus 
for auto workers had been excluded 
the average 2500 payment to 108000 ford motor co employees 
accounted for more than half of the increase in wages and salaries 
last month which rose 05 percent in march the government said 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington 
mass said that with unemployment now at a nineyear low of 56 
percent the modest increase in wages for the month was good news 
he said it showed the economy is not beginning to see inflationary 
pressures from rising wage demands 
wages are rising at an annual rate of about 25 percent to 3 
percent which is still low by historical standards wyss said 
in all personal incomes rose 296 billion to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 392 trillion personal consumption 
spending which includes virtually everything except interest 
payments on debt rose 218 billion to an annual rate of 319 
trillion 
disposable or aftertax incomes were up as well climbing 06 
percent in march following a 08 percent february increase 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income dipped slightly last month to 45 percent from 47 percent 
in february although both months showed an improvement from the 
37 percent average savings rate in 1987 
the spending advance came in the categories of nondurable goods 
and services durable goods items such as cars that are expected 
to last at least three years edged down 300 million during march 
after a huge 92 billion rise in february 
but purchases of nondurable goods were up 98 billion while 
purchases of services which include housing costs rose 122 
billion

us and soviet teams began final negotiations 
wednesday on verification provisions for a 12yearold unratified 
treaty limiting the strength of nonmilitary nuclear explosions 
agreement on those provisions is intended to set the stage for 
an accord by fall on monitoring a 1974 treaty that sets limits on 
nuclear weapons tests 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union and 
secretary of state george p shultz approved plans for onsite 
monitoring last week in moscow 
they told negotiators to have a verification protocol to the 
1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty ready for signature by 
president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev at their moscow summit 
may 29june 2 
us negotiators expect both treaties to be ready for submission 
to the senate by midseptember said c paul robinson chief of the 
american team 
he said they will contain verification tools that cant be 
cheated on robinson said safeguards also were being designed to 
make sure neither side could obtain confidential data on the design 
of the others nuclear charges through testmonitoring devices 
both sides introduced proposed verification measures over the 
past month 
its got us moving very closely toward each other its quite 
encouraging robinson said theres very little time but weve 
gotten a lot behind us 
efforts to clear the last hurdles which robinson would not 
identify began wednesday after a break for the shultzshevardnadze 
meeting 
finishing work on the peaceful explosions pact got priority 
because negotiators agreed that data from joint experimental 
explosions at each countrys test site were not needed robinson 
said 
experience with each sides monitoring techniques will be 
awaited before the delegations complete a protocol on monitoring 
military tests for which both sides also have presented drafts 
the first experiment is scheduled for midjuly at the us site 
in the nevada desert the other is to be held at the soviet unions 
semipalatinsk test range in midaugust 
both the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 peaceful 
nuclear explosions treaty limit explosions to 150 kilotons 
neither was ratified by the senate because they were felt to be 
unenforceable both sides claim to have observed the agreements but 
the reagan administration says the soviets likely exceeded the 
limit on some tests 
the ussoviet negotiations began in november with a test ban 
as their longterm goal in the us view testing is needed as 
long as nuclear weapons exist

simon who has suspended his presidential campaign released a

disclosure issuing these statements since he first took office in 
1955 in the illinois house said simons press secretary david 
carle its a record that is unmatched and one of the things hes 
proudest of in his public service

sen dan evans rwash has given george bush 
some issues advice for his presidential campaign but a 
conservative activist says the vice president should ignore the 
suggestions 
evans advised bush in a letter to deemphasize some key reagan 
administration policies and strive to appeal to young moderate 
voters 
evans said monday that the letter did not urge bush to repudiate 
much of the reagan agenda but did advise bush that its important 
to ensure that the gop convention doesnt veer sharply to the 
right and embarrass you and the party as we move toward the 
november election 
evans letter said dont squander your credibility on issues 
like school prayer and a balanced budget amendment but rather 
focus on those programs which can bring new hope to people and new 
opportunity for our freeenterprise system 
in an april 5 response to evans bush called the letter 
superb and said i agree with most of the suggestions 
robert grant chairman of the conservative lobby christian 
voice issued a statement tuesday saying the proposals posed a 
serious threat to a gop victory in november 
he evans obviously doesnt understand that conservative 
platform planks got ronald reagan elected to two consecutive 
terms grant said 
if the vice president takes in this advice and abandons these 
reagan principles he will incur the risk of losing the 
enthusiastic support of the conservative wing of the republican 
party grant said

a federal judge on wednesday approved with 
several modifications proposed consent decrees to regulate 
allterrain vehicles blamed for nearly 1000 deaths and 300000 
injuries in the last five years 
the settlement between the consumer product safety commission 
and five manufacturers has been criticized by consumer groups and 
lawmakers as not providing adequate protection or compensation for 
owners of the vehicles known as atvs 
but gesell said no decree designed to protect consumers has 
ever gone this far in meeting such a massive national consumer 
problem 
the settlement was approved after the judge persuaded attorneys 
for the cpsc and the manufacturers to agree to several changes in 
the order that satisfy objections he made at an april 18 hearing 
the revised consent decree eliminates a provision that allowed 
the cpsc to initiate a general recall only if it found new and 
substantial evidence that the vehicles were hazardous 
it also bars the cpsc from initiating a socalled generic recall 
of atvs before dec 31 1990 the original decree empowered the 
agency to take such action a year after the agreement received 
court approval 
cpsc general counsel james v lacy said the change clarifies 
the evidentiary standard but provides a longer period of time to 
allow the agreement to work 
the elimination of the substantial evidence wording was 
hailed by katherine meyer an attorney who represented a variety of 
consumer and health groups including the american academy of 
pediatrics and the american public health association 
under the decree as it was previously written the cpsc could 
not do anything further unless it came up with new and substantial 
evidence of safety hazards meyer said such a standard 
excluded a failure to reduce deaths and injuries 
it was a major problem we had with the decree she said 
the consent decrees between the commission and the five 
manufacturers bans the sale of threewheel atvs unless the 
manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by 
the cpsc 
it also requires warning labels on fourwheel models 
distributors must provide training in the safe use of all types of 
atvs to owners who purchased the vehicles after dec 30 1986 
it also requires the manufacturers to spend 85 million to warn 
consumers about the hazards of atvs and promote the training 
there are an estimated 24 million atvs in use in this country 
including 15 million threewheel models 
cpsc chairman terrence m scanlon said in a statement that he 
was personally gratified that the federal district court agreed 
that the commissions allterrain vehicle settlement is in the 
public interest 
had the consent decree not been signed years of protracted 
and uncertain litigation would have followed he said 
with nearly 1000 atvrelated deaths and more than 300000 
hospital emergency room injuries already recorded many to 
children under 16 such a delay would have come at an unacceptebly 
high cost he said 
critics including members of congress and the attorneys general 
of 32 states contended the agreement was flawed because it didnt 
require the manufacturers to give owners a refund for atvs they 
decided they no longer wanted 
the settlement is only a beginning because it fails to include 
any real remedy for the million and a half people who are stuck 
with especially hazardous threewheel atvs rep james florio 
dnj said in a statement 
florio is sponsoring legislation that would require 
manufacturers to make refunds 
ms meyer said that although the groups she represents are 
pleased about the decree they will continue to lobby congress to 
enact a refund bill 
another modification requires the distributors to require 
dealers in new or renewed franchise contracts to warn customers of 
the hazards specifically to children of atvs and to ensure the 
vehicles bear the required safety labels 
the original decree had required the manufacturers to make their 
best efforts to get the dealers to implement these requirements 
other changes include a requirement that cpsc maintain a central 
repository of consumer complaints and other reports to enable the 
public and the agency to determine how the consent decree is 
working 
the agencys general counsel is also required to make a public 
filing to explain why he has granted any extensions in compliance 
deadlines that are longer than six weeks 
one consent decree is with four japanese firms and their 
american divisions honda motor co ltd yamaha motor co ltd 
susuki motors co ltd and kawasaki heavy industries ltd the other 
decree is with polaris industries a usbased manufacturer

fascist vermin sold to a graying gentleman in 
an elegant blazer a blonde in a chic chanel suit bid for long 
live the workers struggle 
an auction of 119 posters designed for the may 1968 student 
uprising drew hundreds of people to the drouot auction house where 
on wednesday a wellestablished crowd paid high prices for the 
antiestablishment works 
television cameras filled the back of the room nostalgia filled 
the air 
i came to buy the posters i had on my wall when i was a 
student said jeanclaude cosneau he was outbid by an art 
collector who paid 540 for the fascist vermine graphic of a 
mean and mangy rat 
i got that poster last time for free said cosneau 37 
shaking his balding head in wonder 
the brightly colored unsigned works some pierced with holes 
or marked by scotch tape brought up to 720 each 
auctioneer pierre cornette de saintcyr wearing jeans and a 
tshirt with the slogan we are all undesirable said the 
posters were beautiful graphics and not just documents of 
history 
the auction the first of two coincided with the 20th 
anniversary of the 1968 revolt a war of words as well as action 
at night students battled police in the left bank of paris by 
day they designed revolutionary art and scrawled slogans on the 
citys walls 
the general will against the will of the general 
imagination power and dozens of other phrases covered the walls 
of the sorbonne university and the subway 
although the graffiti was soon washed away many of the posters 
survived the best of these which combined youthful passion with 
humor and skill were auctioned wednesday many were the work of 
students at the ecole des beaux arts school of fine arts 
on may 8 1968 the usually apolitical students of the ecole des 
beaux arts went on strike as thousands of students across the 
country were doing students took control of the ecoles buildings 
six days later and set up the atelier populaire popular art 
studio 
every day a group would gather at the school to choose a few 
important themes and designers worked on sketches that were then 
critiqued 
these students rejected the idea of art for arts sake and 
denounced bourgeois culture and fame and fortune for artists 
art was to be put at the service of the struggle and should 
be anonymous they said 
thousands of posters promoting the revolution were 
silkscreened quickly and cheaply and distributed throughout the 
french capital 
to their dismay the protesters found their work was collected 
for its commercial worth 
collectors appreciated the grim humor of the works that 
juxtaposed familiar symbols one poster showed the press as a 
bottle of poison and bore the slogan do not swallow another 
which read return to normal was illustrated with a flock of 
sheep a third showed president charles de gaulle in a police 
helmet 
the students complained in a statement that using the posters 
for decorative rather than political purposes was a betrayal 
times have certainly changed 
louis aubry who now owns a gallery on the left bank designed 
one of the posters auctioned wednesday while he was a student at 
the ecole des beaux arts 
the crowd here today is evidence that the epoch was 
important said aubry and in a society that sells everything 
this is to be expected

an fbi specialist said wednesday that a library 
book about poisons entitled deadly harvest had 84 fingerprints 
of stella nickell who is accused of killing her husband and 
another woman with cyanidelaced excedrin 
carl e collins a fingerprint specialist said the prints were 
found on 47 pages of the book and in the poison subject entries of 
three encyclopedia volumes at the library 
collins testimony ended the prosecutions case against mrs 
nickell 44 who is the first person in this country to stand trial 
for causing death by tampering with overthecounter medicine 
a similar case involving tylenol in the chicago area resulted in 
seven deaths but has never been solved 
her attorney says the us district court jury hearing the 
8dayold trial will get to hear mrs nickell tell her own story 
attorney tom hillier began her defense with a doctor explaining 
the autopsy of 52yearold bruce nickell and a social worker who 
described mrs nickells behavior as her husband lay dying 
the defendant sobbed as dr dennis reichenbach of harborview 
medical center in seattle described details of the autopsy 
bruce w stone a former social worker at harborview said mrs 
nickell seemed withdrawn as she sat in the emergency waiting room 
but that this was not unusual 
after repeated questions from assistant us attorney joanne 
maida stone said he couldnt remember whether mrs nickell 
declined to go to her husbands bedside as he lay dying in june 
1986 
prosecutors have portrayed mrs nickell as an unhappy wife in a 
marriage beset by financial problems 
they contend she plotted to collect insurance money from her 
husbands death and spiked other painkilling capsules with cyanide 
so as to make his death appear the work of a random killer 
bottles of tainted painkilling capsules were placed on the 
shelves of drug stores near the nickells home prosecutors said 
mrs nickell is also accused in the death of sue katherine snow 
40 of auburn who also died in june 1986 after swallowing a 
cyanidelaced excedrin 
on tuesday mrs nickells daughter cindy hamilton testified 
that her mother discussed copying the tylenol episodes in the 
chicago area and also asked how to hire a hit man and where she 
could buy heroin 
ms hamilton 28 said her mother told her she had considered 
putting cocaine in nickells iced tea to make it appear he 
overdosed and that one murder attempt involving toxic seeds in a 
capsule failed 
i know my mother very well and basically i knew she was 
capable of it ms hamilton sobbed on the witness stand but i 
was hoping she wouldnt 
prosecutors say mrs nickells effort to make the deaths of her 
husband and ms snow look like randem murders began to unravel when 
ms hamilton went to authorities 
mrs nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product 
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in 
extrastrength excedrin and anacin3 bottles that were recovered in 
stores in auburn and nearby kent

george bush with the republican nomination in 
hand will use the summer months before the gop convention to 
broaden his appeal to the democrats who put ronald reagan in office 
and refine his message beyond loyalty to the president 
reflecting advice given by people outside the campaign bush 
will make a fullfledged effort to make sure the party is 
united lee atwater his top campaign aide said in an interview 
bush the day after clinching the 1139 convention delegates 
needed to win the nomination said in television interviews he was 
anxious to take on likely democratic nominee michael dukakis 
but in the next several weeks bush will be finetuning his 
message during appearances in states with remaining primaries and 
caucuses atwater said he would not however discuss specific 
strategy 
several republicans said in interviews they believe bush ran 
away with the nomination by exploiting longstanding commitments 
from gop officials and officeholders but they also said the time 
has come for bush to spell out his views more clearly 
the biggest mistake the republican party and its candidates 
can do is to go out and say look what weve done these past eight 
years said party chairman frank fahrenkopf voters 
appropriately have short memories he must not only build on the 
record of the past eight years but talk about the future 
fahrenkopf also said he hopes that bush will talk about some 
of the issues that have not gotten as much attention as foreign 
policy defense and economics 
he suggested that bush should work to broaden his appeal to 
women voters while the republican party has stood for protecting 
family values fahrenkopf said that doesnt mean that the 
republican party and george bush are not going to have to take a 
look at things like child care 
bush in a television interview on cable news network said he 
will debate his opponent during the general election campaign 
i think any candidate any nominee of his party should have 
the right to negotiate for when the debates should be who should 
sponsor them and all of that but i will have debates and i look 
forward to it he said 
bush is going to have to win over suspicious conservatives while 
working to attract such traditionally democratic and independent 
voters as bluecollar workers and ethnics who voted for reagan 
some analysts said 
i think he has a problem said gop consultant john 
deardourff in a certain sense he is not the master of his own 
destiny a captive candidate he cannot run away from any aspect of 
the reaganbush record he may be very uncomfortable bearing that 
burden 
hes not in a position to say i think the president was 
wrong to keep offering attorney general ed meese little shades of 
comfort here and there deardourff said 
even if that werent the case he is about to be the nominee 
of a bunch of delegates who are very conservative people theres 
little room for leeway there 
fahrenkopf however said he does not worry about bushs 
flexibility being limited by a party platform drafted at least in 
part by hardcore conservatives 
i dont look for any battles on the platform he said 
noting that bush supported the 1980 platform i think there will 
be strong support among conservatives for the vice president 
mitchell daniels a former reagan political adviser said that 
bush succeeded in winning the nomination by using an errorfree 
riskfree strategy which i think was a very wise approach for a 
vice president 
but daniels also said he felt that tactic would be a very 
hazardous approach in the fall election campaign 
bush in brief network television interviews wednesday 
acknowledged that he wants to improve his appeal to blacks other 
minorities and ethnic groups 
he noted that the democratic party has won most blacks votes 
for decades but he said that could change if jesse jacksons 
supporters dont like the way he is treated as the campaign plays 
out 
if hes not treated fairly a lot of people are going to be 
openminded and if i campaign properly with the way i feel in my 
heart about openness and inclusion we might surprise people 
there he said 
republican consultant eddie mahe jr said he thought talk of 
bushs need to broaden his appeal to groups outside the party has 
been exaggerated 
to the extent that broadening the base means moving to the 
left i dont think he has to do that mahe said i think 
george bushs bigger problem is to persuade critics that his 
sense of the world and the globe is very much the same as ronald 
reagans

a convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers 
sailed up the persian gulf wednesday after a oneday delay prompted 
by minehunting operations and poor weather a us central command 
spokesman said 
tanker convoys fell behind schedule after the us frigate 
samuel b roberts hit a mine on april 14 injuring 10 seamen and 
after about a dozen more mines subsequently were found in central 
gulf shipping lanes 
three kuwaiti tankers and a fourth usflagged ship were 
sighted proceeding north wednesday off the united arab emirates 
after moving through the strait of hormuz during the night four 
us warships escorted them 
in brussels where a meeting of nato defense ministers was being 
held britain belgium the netherlands and italy agreed on 
wednesday to step up cooperation among their minesweeping forces 
in the gulf 
last week belgian and other mine sweepers found newly laid 
mines in the waterway following us retaliatory strikes on iranian 
oil facilities the strikes were carried out after the roberts was 
mined 
us officials welcomed the european decision to work together 
more closely 
officials of the north atlantic treaty organization said the 
united states meanwhile was still considering extending its 
protection in the gulf to ships not flying the stars and stripes 
british defense secretary george younger said america is 
talking about the possibility of protecting other flags theyd 
restrict themselves to protecting friendly shipping from attacks 
by iran 
iran and iraq went to war in september 1980 and fighting between 
the persian gulf neighbors later extended to the gulf waters 
no reports emerged of activity by irans navy or missile 
batteries during the latest convoys passage through the narrow 
southern entry to the gulf 
iran said wednesday that 15 us marines were wounded in april 
18 skirmishes between us and iranian forces and were flown to 
west germany for treatment 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in manama 
said the wounded men were earlier hospitalized in bahrain adding 
that the us has not yet disclosed its casualty figures in the 
fighting 
a us central command spokesman was unavailable to comment on 
the iranian report the pentagon said earlier no american 
casualties occurred in daylong skirmishes that began with an attack 
by us warships on iranian oil platforms 
the kuwaiti daily alseyassah quoted a soviet military 
commander gen yuri markivov as saying in an interview wednesday 
that the presence of foreign fleets in the gulf implies a 
dangerous possibiliity of turning the war into a wider regional 
conflict 
marikov was quoted as saying the soviet union does not intend to 
use its weapons in the gulf because this would lead to the 
outbreak of a third world war 
he said the soviet union has three warships in the gulf for 
escorting soviet commercial ships the kuwaiti paper reported 
gulfbased shipping executives who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said the latest us convoy included the destroyers 
obrien and merrill the guided missile destroyer joseph strauss 
and the guided missile cruiser wainwright 
the tankers in the convoy included the 46723ton gas queen a 
liquefied gas carrier the oil products tankers chesapeake city and 
ocean city each 79999 tons and the golden monarch a 92854ton 
tanker 
an unidentified tanker flying the british flag was sailing 
alongside the singlefile convoy 
the convoy had turned back after originally starting out on 
tuesday because of a sandstorm that would have hindered helicopters 
and patrol craft in their efforts to scout for mines ahead of the 
ships 
the kuwaiti tankers were reflagged by the united states last 
year for protection from iranian attack

palestinian guerrillas crossed israels heavily 
guarded border from lebanon for the second day in a row wednesday 
and wounded a truck driver before soldiers caught them in a ravine 
and killed them the army said 
no israeli army casualties were reported 
israeli officials said the increase in crossborder raids 
appeared connected with nearly five months of violence in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
documents found on the two dead guerrillas showed they planned 
to take hostages and try to exchange them for arab prisoners held 
in israeli jails using us ambassador thomas pickering as a 
negotiator a military source said 
settlements in northern israel were put on alert during a 
threehour search for the guerrillas by foot patrols and 
helicopters roads were closed and men were told to stand guard 
with guns women and children were ordered to stay indoors 
on tuesday three guerrillas crossed the border at the same 
spot they and two soldiers were killed when an army patrol found 
them 
a 14yearold palestinian girl died wednesday of wounds suffered 
the day before when israeli soldiers opened fire during an arab 
protest in the occupied west bank the army and hospital officials 
said 
her death brought to at least 174 the number of palestinians 
killed since a rebellion began dec 8 among the 15 palestinians in 
the west bank and gaza which israel has occupied since the 1967 
war an israeli soldier and a jewish settler also have been killed 
the guerrillas crossed the border unnoticed and it was the 
truck driver who alerted troops after running away from the 
assailants said the military source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
while officials say violence in the territories has declined 
maj gen yossi peled said on israel radio there is an increased 
effort on the part of palestinians to reach northern settlements 
and this is certainly a change he is chief of israels 
northern command in charge of the border area 
defense minister yitzhak rabin appeared to blame syria saying 
that the last three attacks from lebanon were carried out out 
by prosyrian plo groups 
a joint statement issued in beirut claimed responsibility for 
tuesdays raid on behalf of lebanon communist party led by george 
hawi and george habashs popular front for the liberation of 
palestine a prosyrian faction of the palestine liberation 
organization 
but the military source said the guerrillas were members of the 
prosyrian palestine liberation front headed by mohammed abbas 
who was blamed for the 1985 hijacking of the achille lauro cruise 
ship in which an american was killed 
also on wednesday an army inquiry said the teenage jewish 
settler who died april 6 in a clash with palestinians in the west 
bank town of beita was killed by a bullet fired by an israeli 
guarding her hiking party 
it blamed beita residents for provoking the incident in which 
two palestinians also were killed and the guard was seriously 
wounded 
according to the army report on the incursion two guerrillas 
armed with hand grenades and light weapons crossed the border at 
midday wednesday within yards of the spot where the three 
palestinians infiltrated a day earlier 
they attacked truck driver dan dahan 24 near tank junction 
where a rusting ruin of a soviet tank used by the syrians in the 
1967 middle east war stands as a memorial 
suddenly they fired at me and threw a grenade dahan 
said on israel radio i jumped from the truck and it started to 
roll down and i hid behind it they fired at me while i crawled on 
the ground and i ran into the bushes 
dahan was shot in the hand and wounded in the back by grenade 
shrapnel 
zvi yuval a 37yearold civilian from kibbutz senir about three 
miles south of the border was among those who stood guard he told 
the associated press he heard constant gunfire during the search 
including shots fired from helicopters 
we fear there will be more attacks this summer he said 
thats when the vegetation is like a jungle providing cover 
for guerrillas 
border crossings often cause an uproar in securityconscious 
israel after tuesdays penetration prime minister yitzhak shamir 
sought to reassure israelis by declaring on israel radio we are 
paying a high price but the border is impenetrable for 
terrorists so it is and so it will be 
the prosyrian democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
claimed responsibility for tuesdays attack

a number of us attorneys concerned over 
attorney general edwin meese iiis inability to fill the justice 
departments no 2 post want one of their colleagues installed in 
the vacant position three department sources said wednesday 
a justice department advisory committee of us attorneys held a 
lengthy discussion about the vacancy tuesday and concluded in an 
informal vote that meese should chose robert ulrich the us 
attorney in kansas city to fill the post of deputy attorney 
general said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
ulrich is chairman of the advisory committee but was not in the 
room when the consensus was reached said the sources 
justice department spokesman terry eastland said he spoke to 
several us attorneys on the advisory committee and could find no 
evidence of any written or verbal petition that was delivered to 
the meese on the matter 
the sources said the us attorneys had not presented their 
views to meese who was in california on wednesday and that it was 
unclear whether they would do so 
the deputy attorney general post became vacant last friday with 
the departure of arnold burns who submitted his resignation march 
29 in a protest against meeses continued tenure burns reportedly 
felt meeses refusal to resign in the face of a nearly yearlong 
criminal investigation was damaging justice department operations 
the sense at the meeting was that the us attorneys wanted 
ulrich and wanted him as deputy because thats where their bread is 
buttered said one of the sources they want someone who knows

a soviet newspaper on wednesday credited nikita s 
khrushchev with planting the seeds for mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms 20 years later but said the late former premier caused 
his own downfall with his inconsistency 
the twopage article in moscow news was one of the most detailed 
evaluations to appear in the soviet press of the man who launched 
the destalinization drive by denouncing the dictators cult 
of personality in 1956 
it comes as soviet scholars and writers are trying to come to 
grips with the legacy of josef stalin during stalins almost three 
decades of rule millions of soviets died as a result of purges and 
crash programs of industrialization and collectivization of 
agriculture 
khrushchev consolidated his power after stalin died in 1953 but 
was forced out by other communist party leaders in 1964 
not one of his steps was made firmly enough not one of his 
beginnings was carried out to the end philosopher yuri levada 
and economist viktor sheinis wrote 
all the same the main result of the stormy and contradictory 
decade without a doubt was that a return to stalinism at least 
in its earlier classical forms was impossible unthinkable 
the writers said krushchev set the stage for new social and 
political thinking 
a new generation came into the life of society not knowing 
total fear able to learn to understand its society and restructure 
it after two decades these seeds bore fruit they said 
the writers said one major lesson of the khrushchev period was 
that the policies of any leader are insecure if they depend mainly 
on the division of power at the highest official levels 
it said democracy the rule of law and openness must predominate 
khrushchev became a nonentity in the official press during the 
leadership of president leonid i brezhnev who succeeded him 
but gorbachev criticized brezhnev for allowing stagnation and 
corruption to overcome soviet society and gave khrushchev a 
measure of praise in a speech last november marking the 70th 
anniversary of the bolshevik revolution 
wednesdays article was accompanied by three photos of 
khrushchev including one with party theoretician mikhail suslov 
and geneticist trofim lysenko 
lysenko dominated much of soviet agriculture in stalins last 
years and now is accused of having held back the study of genetics 
with baseless scientific theories suslov was a powerful member of 
brezhnevs politburo before his death in 1982 
moscow news said many of khrushchevs foreign policy moves were 
not well thought out but credited him and president john f 
kennedy with wise leadership during the 1962 cuban missile crisis 
it said khrushchevs boast to capitalist countries we will 
bury you fed western fears of soviet aggressiveness

president reagan reaffirmed his belief in 
attorney general edwin meese iiis honesty on wednesday asserting 
that only a complete change of character would force him to ask 
his longtime friend to resign 
reagan reacted heatedly when reporters queried him about a wall 
street journal report wednesday that said some of his friends and 
advisers had mounted an effort to oust the attorney general and 
that nancy reagan supported it 
i shouldnt answer the question but i have to tell you no 
im not aware of such a move reagan responded 
i thought the story was totally inaccurate he added 
asked what circumstances might prompt him to get rid of meese 
the president shot back well if he had a complete change of 
character 
meese attending a funeral in pasadena calif on wednesday 
said 
today ive had a number of phone calls to me directly and to 
my office by a number of people mentioned in the article they all 
said that its untrue the substance of the article as it pertains 
to them was untrue 
he added that he had not spoken with mrs reagan about the 
article but said the presidents comments showed that he still 
supported him 
vice president george bush the apparent republican nominee for 
president said in a television interview on cable news network 
ed meese will obviously make his determination at his time and 
in the rest of the time the system is moving forward and thats 
the way it ought to be 
i cant tell you it would help or hurt the bush presidential 
campaign the vice president said but he meese is entitled 
to a very objective determination as to whether he may have done 
something wrong 
i will not get into this particular case bush said i 
dont think its my role as a vice president to try to out there 
and suggest that mr meese ought to get out or stay 
in spite of meeses legal problems reagan has consistently 
defended his attorney generals ethics and his performance at the 
justice department 
however the department has been beset by the resignations of 
several toplevel meese associates and officials have been 
scrambling to fill a vacuum in the key posts 
two of those who resigned arnold i burns and william weld had 
a facetoface meeting last week with reagan in which they outlined 
their reasons for leaving and said they felt meese should resign in 
the face of an array of investigations weld told reagan that if it 
were up to him he would indict meese according to an 
administration source speaking anonymously 
independent counsel james c mckay has been examining meeses 
assistance to the scandalplagued wedtech corp and a proposed 1 
billion oil pipeline project also under investigation are meeses 
meetings with regional bell telephone company executives at a time 
when he owned 14000 in baby bell stock and the role of meeses 
longtime friend e robert wallach in securing a 40000ayear 
job for the attorney generals wife ursula meese 
last friday sen daniel p moynihan dny asked the general 
services administration to provide him with a full report on 
the signing in may 1987 of a 50 million lease on an office 
building for justice department workers 
a partnership headed by howard m bender owned the building 
which was sold for a 226 million profit 13 days after the lease 
was signed the bender family foundation pays mrs meeses 40000 
salary at the multiple sclerosis society 
despite meeses legal problems reagan consistently has stood by 
the man who has served him since his days as governor of california 
justice department spokesman patrick korten said meese was 
returning to washington on wednesday night to resume a full work 
schedule thursday 
the attorney general not only has a full schedule for the rest 
of the week but for the next couple of months he is preparing for 
events in july and august there is no question in my mind that he 
intends to fulfill his obligations as attorney general for the 
forseeable future 
korten said the wall street journals sources were engaging in 
fiction or perhaps wishful thinking and that the story does 
not come close to reflecting reality 
the journal story quoted a white house official it did not name 
as saying the dumpmeese effort has gone underground despite 
reagans repeated orders to halt any action against the attorney 
general 
the report identified longtime reagan campaign consultant stuart 
spencer as being one of the associates convinced that ethical 
questions plaguing meese had become a threat to the republican 
party as well as damaging the justice department 
the paper also said white house officials sounded out former 
defense secretary caspar w weinberger as a possible successor to 
meese but weinberger rejected the proposal 
weinberger was asked about the report wednesday in orlando 
fla where he was speaking to the american automobile association 
i think we have a good attorney general the former cabinet 
officer said adding that he had no desire to return to government 
service 
he later told cable news network the journal story was all 
wrong 
these things are not so weinberger said i did not have 
any suggestion that mr meese should leave and under no 
circumstances whatever would i even take the office if it should 
be offered its never been offered 
asked to comment on mrs reagans reported role in the meese 
ouster campaign elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary 
said she hasnt been making any telephone calls she hasnt been 
getting any telephone calls shes not involved in it 
mrs reagan also knows that meese has to go the newspaper 
said quoting a person familiar with the first ladys views mrs 
reagan was widely reported to have been unhappy with the 
performance of former chief of staff donald t regan a development 
that helped tip the scale against him 
asked about this mrs crispen replied its very difficult 
for me to respond to these ghost quotes i dont know if this 
person has talked to the first lady in the past year i do know 
that she hasnt been involved in any campaign to oust the 
attorney general 
meeses future drew a variety of comments from a group of 
senators who visited briefly with reagan during a private bill 
signing ceremony 
certainly you have to be concerned about how effective he can 
be in his job but i want to underscore that theres been a lot of 
accusations made and so far no proof i think we need to be 
very careful that we dont find people guilty before they are 
charged or tried said sen james a mcclure ridaho 
its a judgment question for the president and for him 
whether all the conversation about it and all the reports that 
swirl around him have impaired his ability to function mcclure 
added 
sen brock adams dwash a former transportation secretary 
under president carter said meese should step down 
i think resignations at times are necessary i think he 
should resign for the benefit of making the department of justice 
move well and swiftly

members signed the statement in which they pledged their troops 
would maintain the suspension of military operations in 
nicaragua 
the statement represents the first time the military has issued

san jose costa rica where they would spend the night before 
flying to the talks according to jorge rosales a spokesman for 
the rebels 
calero in an interview monday denied any attempt to fire 
bermudez but conceded that there were differences among the leaders 
and that two commanders had expressed disagreement with the talks 
he also acknowledged a shakeup in the military staff saying 
three civilian staff members had been fired and replaced by 
officers 
wednesdays statement by the military seemed designed to allow 
the contras to go into thursdays talks showing a united front 
the military reiterates its support to the directorate of the 
nicaraguan resistance in the process of negotiations initiated 
with an accord reached march 23 in sapoa nicaragua said the 
declaration issued by the contras miami headquarters 
the statement said five military leaders including four members 
of bermudezs general staff would attend the managua talks with 
the directors 
the commanders promised to maintain a suspension of offensive 
military operations in all of the national territory 
but they emphasized that the central american peace plan which 
led to the sapoa agreement has democratization as an essential 
condition for reaching peace and national reconciliation 
the contras have insisted that they will not lay down their arms 
until the sandinista government takes concrete steps toward 
democracy in the country

white house communications director tom 
griscom ordered a secret service officer to expel new york times 
reporter steven roberts from his office wednesday after an apparent 
heated exchange concerning news coverage of attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
neither participant would personally discuss the incident and a 
telephone call to griscom was not immediately returned 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he knew of no other 
occasion when a reporter was escorted against his or her will from 
the private offices in the west wing of the white house 
the west wing where the presidents oval office is located is 
mostly offlimits to reporters and they may visit there only when 
escorted by white house personnel 
the times washington bureau chief craig whitney confirmed the 
incident 
mr griscom called me saying hed taken offense at something 
steve had said regarding his truthfulness whitney said 
whitney said he did not know whether griscom asked roberts to 
leave before calling for the secret service officer all he 
griscom told me was he had had him roberts escorted out of his 
office whitney said 
however a senior white house official who spoke about the 
incident but asked not to be quoted said griscom had asked roberts

the national rifle associations chief 
lobbyist gave a qualified endorsement wednesday to compromise 
legislation setting a minimum metallic standard for socalled 
plastic guns 
the justice department and law enforcement groups worked out the 
compromise and it is being introduced in the senate by james a 
mcclure ridaho 
our opinion is its not a bad bill said the nras james j 
baker characterizing his support as a qualified endorsement 
baker said the nras main concern had been to ensure that 
legislation didnt ban currently possessed firearms or any firearms 
currently being manufactured in the united states or imported here 
the nra also wanted to ensure that government officials have no 
discretion to set standards that would lead to any ban the 
compromise would achieve those goals said baker 
the nras concerns with the compromise stem from the fact that 
there are law enforcement provisions attached to the new mcclure 
bill unrelated to plastic guns which the nra feels should be taken 
out and handled in separate legislation 
the new mcclure legislation would require that guns contain 
material that would be as detectable by metal detectors as 37 
ounces of stainless steel the gun could have less metal or a 
different kind of metal as long as it would meet the same 
detectability standard 
earlier the nra had insisted that there should be no 
governmentestablished metal standard 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio had offered legislation with 
a higher metallic standard than the compromise the nra said 
metzenbaums bill would have banned millions of handguns 
metzenbaum called the compromise very workable said it will 
keep undetectable weapons out of hands of terrorists he added 
that the compromise wont in any way infringe on legitimate 
rights of gun owners 
mcclure said the compromise assures the safety of travelers 
without being a piece of gun control legislation 
the nra and meese had supported mcclures earlier bill that 
would ban manufacture of undetectable plastic guns but not require 
a specific amount of metal 
at a news conference a justice department official said meese 
is not withdrawing his support from the earlier mcclure bill but 
we think this is a better bill said joseph morris director of 
the office of liaison services justice department spokesman 
patrick korten denied that meese had changed his position on the 
issue 
police organizations and guncontrol advocates have insisted 
that a minimum amount of metal be required in a gun to ensure 
detection by the magnetometers used in airport and building 
security systems 
the gun control and police groups have argued that not having a 
metal standard would cause long delays in airports they contended 
that without a minimum metal requirement for the gun magnetometers 
must be used at settings so sensitive that they would constantly 
trigger alarms

negotiations early thursday failed to 
bring a settlement to a strike by thousands of workers at one of 
polands biggest steel mills and strikers said management was 
threatening police intervention 
strikers at the sprawling lenin steel mill outside krakow in 
southern poland issued a statement declaring the economic policy 
of authorities of the polish peoples republic has led millions of 
workers and their families to the limits of poverty our faith 
in party reforms is exhausted 
solidarity chairman lech walesa earlier urged nationwide 
pressure on the authorities to bring about reforms 
the strike was the biggest industrial action in poland since the 
1981 crackdown on the nowoutlawed solidarity trade union movement 
and it posed the sharpest challenge yet to government economic 
reform policies 
another strike was threatened friday at the 18000worker 
stalowa wola heavy machinery plant in southeast poland and the 
government prepared to enter talks thursday with transit workers 
representatives seeking higher pay 
a midnight negotiating session with management officials at the 
lenin steel mill ended after just 15 minutes according to a strike 
committee member who was reached by telephone and spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the director said they were running out of possibilities of 
solving it politically and later the zomo riot police would take 
over said the strike committee member 
on wednesday the second day of the stoppage workers rejected a 
big pay raise offer 
we want our wages to assure us and our families a dignified 
life and a proper rest after work said the steel workers 
statement signed by 16 members of the workers strike committee 
and read over the telephone 
a strike committee member maciej mach said management hinted 
during talks earlier wednesday evening that force could be used to 
break the strike but he said this only strengthened workers 
resolve 
there is enormous pressure on us to stop he said various 
arguments are used including psychological arguments arguments of 
fear that december 1981 may be repeated 
on dec 13 1981 soldiers and police suppressed solidarity and 
arrested hundreds of union supporters 
mach said the strike committee decided not to ask walesa to join 
the talks partly out of concern for him 
let him remain in gdansk where he is safe he said 
strikers called on the government to double the 15 compensation 
paid for recent price increases to many groups including 
industrial workers retirees teachers and health workers 
they demanded an immediate 50 percent raise in the average 105 
paid monthly pay to the lenin plants 32000 workers and turned 
down a management offer of 50 in phasedin raises this year 
the strike committee firmly rejected the offer broadcast 
over loudspeakers to the workers wednesday in a bid to break the 
strike said jacek kuron a solidarity adviser in warsaw 
organizers said 12000 workers were on strike with many staying 
at the site after their shifts government spokesman jerzy urban 
said the number was 2000 
an earlier round of talks that began at 6 pm broke off before 
9 pm without results said a strike committee member who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
wieslaw mazurkiewicz another member of the hastily established 
strike committee reported the mood is great we are all decided 
to strike until our demands are fully met 
outwardly the plant appeared calm with no banners and little 
activity 
walesa lent his support to the strikers wednesday in a statement 
issued from his home in gdansk 
our union appeals to all living social forces for the 
undertaking of united actions to put pressure on the authorities 
he said millions of people are waiting for restoration of the 
rights of their trade union solidarity 
the strike began tuesday with 700 workers at the plant and then 
grew on monday 2800 transit workers in the western city of 
bydgoszcz staged an 11hour strike and won hourly wage increases of 
60 percent 
galloping inflation in poland has created widespread pressure 
for wage increases 
prices in poland shot up 42 percent in the first three months of 
1988 as a result of a government economic program to reduce 
subsidies on many consumer items part of the increase was 
compensated for automatically and the remainder was dependent on 
the profitability of enterprises 
the staterun news agency pap said wednesday that raises given 
without regard to an enterprises ability to pay would undermine 
the entire reform 
kuron said the strike poses a dilemma for the government 
if they give up at the lenin mill then everyone will line 
up for raises he said if they stay tough there could be a 
more violent confrontation 
urban in an interview said city transit workers in lodz torun 
and grudziadz requested raises after the bydgoszcz settlement 
the head of the officially sanctioned union at the lenin steel 
mill stanislaw sitkowski said many of his members were taking 
part in the strike and we do support these actions we are 
of the opinion that wages are too low 
after the banning of solidarity the government organized an 
officially sanctioned trade union alliance which claims 7 million 
members at its height solidarity said it had 10 million members 
in the country of 37 million people

plo chief yasser arafat will heighten the 
arab rebellion in the israelioccupied territories senior aides 
said wednesday after meeting with syrian leaders to cement a new 
strategic alliance 
vice president abdulhalim khaddam met until early wednesday 
with arafats aides president hafez assad and arafat took steps 
toward reconciliation earlier this week after a fiveyear feud 
farouk kaddoumi who serves as foreign minister of the palestine 
liberation organization led a delegation of three other top 
officials of fatah the plos main guerrilla component and arafats 
power base hayel abdelhamid mohammed rateb ghoneim and hani 
hassan 
the meeting ended at 2 am kaddoumi and abdelhamid left later 
for tunis the plo headquarters 
hassan and ghoneim remained in damascus for further talks on 
joint action against israel and the latest us peace proposals for 
the middle east 
george habash leader of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine the secondlargest plo faction after arafats fatah 
told reporters arafat and assad still differed on several points 
he said one was arafats continuing good relations with egypt 
which syria condemns for its 1979 peace treaty with israel and 
another was plo relations with some israelis habash a staunch 
ally of syria did not elaborate 
other points of conflict habash mentioned were the palestinian 
role in lebanon where syria is the main power broker and how to 
improve fatahs relations with prosyrian palestinian factions 
before leaving damascus kaddoumi said no differences remained 
between syria and the plo and only details had to be worked out 
arafat went to baghdad from damascus on tuesday plo officials 
in the iraqi capital said he would meet with his commanders to 
discuss ways of escalating the palestinian uprising 
attending will be members of the emergency committee set up in 
january to coordinate palestinian protests of israeli rule in the 
west bank and gaza strip that began dec 8 the officials reported 
at least 174 palestinians have been killed in the occupied 
terrotories 
plo military commander khalil wazir led the committee but was 
assassinated april 16 at his home in tunis apparently by an 
israeli commando unit 
the slaying of wazir widely respected by both arafat loyalists 
and opponents is seen as the catalyst that brought arafat and 
assad together arafat arrived sunday on his first visit to syria 
since assad expelled him on june 24 1983 
both leaders favor bolstering the palestinian rebellion against 
israeli occupation and oppose the us peace plan proposed in march 
by secretary of state george p shultz 
it calls for limited palestinian selfrule in the west bank and 
gaza far short of the independent state syria and the plo demand 
kaddoumi said the plo and syria will seek arab consensus on 
the us plan and on a strategy for the palestinian uprising at a 
special arab summit planned for early june in algiers

union spokesman 
he refused to speculate on the origin of the bug which he said 
was discovered by a security firm doing a routine sweep last 
week of the unions coral gables headquarters 
at this point in time i think it would be premature for us to 
make any accusations cole said

fbi agent al lamanna in miami said his office had not received 
any report of the alpa wiretap 
duty officers at the tallahassee and the miami offices of the 
florida department of law enforcement said they didnt know if 
their agency was involved in the investigation 
the bug was described by the union statement as a 
stateoftheart listening device it was found on the line 
most frequently used by jack bavis chairman of the alpa local 
cole said 
the sophisticated parasitic transmitter device had the 
capability to be accessed with a radio receiver up to several 
hundred feet away from the building the statement said 
cole said security experts could not yet tell how long it had 
been in place

the senate on wednesday rejected an attempt to 
bar federal spending on cleanneedle programs for drug addicts at 
risk of aids and braced for a series of controversial amendments to 
a bipartisan aids bill 
the vote was 6618 against the amendment offered by sen jesse 
helms rnc to a fiscal 1989 aids spending blueprint sponsored 
by sens edward kennedy dmass and orrin hatch rutah 
the amendment would have prevented the use of federal money for 
programs in which drug addicts trade in dirty hypodermic needles in 
exchange for clean ones so they dont spread the deadly aids virus 
the kennedyhatch aids research and information bill authorizes 
665 million for state and federal information and education 
campaigns home health care for aids patients new hiring at the 
national institutes of health and special projects targeted to drug 
abusers and minorities the bill also authorizes openended 
research spending expected to bring the total to about 1 billion 
the questions of aids testing confidentiality and 
discrimination are addressed in a separate bill that has not 
reached the house or senate floor 
but those and other inflammatory issues such as mandatory 
testing for marriage license applicants were likely to come up in 
amendments several senators planned to offer to the aids education 
bill 
the american people have a right to know where we stand on 
routine testing and on the use of taxpayers dollars to promote 
sodomy helms said i will strongly oppose the use of 
taxpayers money to advocate or condone sexual activity outside of 
monogamous marriage 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons and its chief victims have 
been homosexual men and intravenous drug users 
several senators said the helms amendment on clean needles was 
written so badly that it would have denied hospices hospitals 
nursing homes and researchers the use of hypodermics and syringes 
and they said the federal government shouldnt tie the hands of 
states cities and researchers trying to curb the spread of the 
fatal disease among intravenous drug users 
its only impact will be to destroy our ability to fight this 
disease and find a cure hatch said of the helms proposal 
however helms later said he had rewritten his amendment to make 
it more specific and won permission to offer it again thursday 
helms and others have condemned educational materials aimed at 
homosexual men saying they promote sodomy 
among the many amendments helms had on tap was a ban on federal 
money for education or information materials that promote 
encourage or condone homosexual activities a similar helms 
provision adopted last year on a 942 vote is due to expire sept 
30 
but at least one senator who voted for it last year said he had 
changed his mind and would vote against when it came up again 
probably on thursday 
sen alan cranston dcalif said he is convinced the amendment 
is having fatal consequences because aids service organizations 
have not received new money since last november he said the 
federal centers for disease control had asked them not to apply for 
funds until the situation is clarified 
promoting and encouraging homosexuality is simply not the 
issue before us cranston said what the government must do is 
its utmost to save lives we must oppose every attempt to censor 
vital lifesaving information about aids 
in action wednesday on another helms amendment the senate 
overturned the district of columbias ban on aids testing for 
insurance applicants 
helms said diabetics and many other groups of people are unable 
to get health insurance because of their conditions his amendment 
prevailed on a quick voice vote despite arguments by others that 
congress should not override a law passed by the disctrict of 
columbia city council 
as of april 21 aids had been diagnosed in about 59500 
americans of whom more than half or about 33000 have died since 
june 1981 according to the federal centers for disease control no 
one is known to have recovered from aids

intravenous drug users should be given free 
needles and condoms to prevent the spread of aids according to a 
report prepared for the canadian government and released wednesday 
the oneyear study by the royal society of canada urged federal 
and provincial governments across canada to spend 94 million 
us more each year on aids research public education and 
support services for victims 
i see a lot of human suffering on a daytoday basis and that 
suffering can only grow unless we take action today said dr 
chris tsoukas one of the authors of the report 
the study rejected proposals for mandatory aids testing for

annual convention of the american newspaper publishers association 
soviet journalists are now allowed to write about issues

dark pages he said

reagan gerasimov said as i understand it i will be standing 
right there at white house spokesman marlin fitzwaters side to

navy salvage workers found the bodies of 
three missing sailors at their stations aboard the drifting 
submarine uss bonefish on wednesday nearly three days after 
explosions and fire forced the evacuation of the vessel 
the navys top officer said the three crewmen may have died at 
their posts while their 89 shipmates evacuated the vessel filled 
with smoke and toxic fumes from an explosion in a forward battery 
compartment 
shortly after midnight the salvage crew went aboard and 
discovered the bodies said chief petty officer terry d borton 
a spokesman at atlantic fleet headquarters here two of the 
victims were discovered in the control room and the other in an 
administrative compartment 
the crewmen were identified as lt ray everts 30 of naoma 
wva petty officer 1st class robert w bordelon jr 39 of 
willis texas and petty officer 3rd class marshall t lindgren 
21 of pisgah forest nc 
borton said he did not know when or where the bodies would be 
returned to shore the cause of death would not be known until a 
medical examination was complete he said 
the 30yearold dieselelectric vessel was taken under tow by 
the salvage ship uss hoist headed for the subs home port of 
charleston sc chief petty officer joseph c mowery another 
fleet spokesman said late wednesday 
mowery said the trip would take two to four days depending on 
the weather 
on tuesday adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval operations 
said he believed the three died at their posts perhaps ensuring 
the safety of the other 89 sailors aboard the bonefish 
all three of those individuals were on watch in the control 
room and were last seen there so it may well be that they simply 
ensured that everyone got clear and they themselves did not make 
it he said 
crew members from the salvage ship uss hoist went aboard the sub 
tuesday to close a hatch that had been left open but no one 
entered the vessel until later in the day when the venting of the 
interior was completed a team sent belowdecks discovered the 
bodies borton said 
the first explosion hit the subs battery compartment at 440 
pm sunday the ship was cruising at periscope depth at the time 
but the crew was able to bring it to the surface 160 miles east of 
port canaveral fla once the ship surfaced the crew was ordered 
to evacuate 
they were taken off the bonefish by helicopter and whaleboat 
from the aircraft carrier john f kennedy and the frigate uss carr 
both of which were participating in routine exercises with the sub 
of the 22 crewmen injured in the incident 20 have been released 
from the naval hospital in jacksonville and returned to charleston 
nineteen of the injured were discharged monday after a night in the 
hospital 
explosions in battery compartments are one of a diesel 
submariners nightmares according to one civilian expert 
thats the typical way a dieselelectric submarine goes down 
the tubes in peacetime said norman friedman author of 
submarine design and development 
the 219foot bonefish is one of the navys few remaining 
dieselelectric submarines on the surface it is powered by diesel 
engines when submerged it runs off two electric motors powered by 
massive storage batteries fore and aft 
when these batteries are recharged when the ship is surfaced 
or running at periscope depth hydrogen and other battery gases 
are produced each of the batteries has a ventilating system to 
discharge the gases 
but said friedman if those gases are allowed to build up a 
spark can set off a hydrogen explosion and fire

president reagan told canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney on wednesday to make no mistake we are moving 
against environmental pollution but mulroney demanded more action 
to stop us acid rain from killing our lakes soiling our 
cities 
a senior us official told reporters mulroney gave reagan 
some private ideas on how they might reach agreement on the 
issue the official who spoke on condition of anonymity could 
offer no details on those ideas 
at a welcoming ceremony on the south lawn of the white house 
reagan told the canadian leader more can be done to protect our 
environment when science clearly points the way make no mistake 
we are moving 
the us government contends that more needs to be done in 
developing clean coal technology before targets and timetables can 
be set for reducing coalfired power plant emissions that canadians 
say are damaging their forests and lakes 
canada has been pressing for an agreement on a timetable to 
reduce emissions to specified levels in an interview before 
leaving ottawa mulroney likened the us acidrain emissions to 
this country dumping garbage on its northern neighbor 
asked about this as the two leaders posed for photographers 
before their meeting in the oval office mulroney said i think 
its very clear that acid rain has that effect on the environment 
in the eastern united states and canada yes i think thats a 
normal fact 
mulroney pleaded before a joint meeting of congress for what he 
acknowledged would be expensive programs to clean up us 
emissions which he said caused half the acid rain that has killed 
15000 canadian lakes and threatened or damaged 300000 more 
half of our acid rain comes across the border directly from 
the united states falling upon our forests killing our lakes 
soiling our cities mulroney told congress 
it is despoiling your environment as inexorably as our he 
said it is damaging your environment as inexorably as it is 
ours it is damaging your environment from michigan to maine and 
threatens marine life on the eastern seabord 
he said canadian acid rain wafting to the united states will be 
halved by his governments programs we ask nothing more than 
this from you 
we invite the administration and the leadership of congress 
to conclude an accord whereby we agree on a schedule and targets 
for reducing acid rain that crosses our border he said the 
cost of reducing acid rain is substantial but the cost of inaction 
is greater still 
what would be said of a generation of north americans that 
found a way to explore the stars but allowed its lakes and forests 
to languish and die 
reagan agreed later in a toast at a state dinner in mulroneys 
honor there is much still to be done on acid rain but said 
progress is being made 
the canadian prime minister called the occasion the last of 
our home and home visits and said he believed they had become 
part of the institutional relationship between canada and the 
united states 
the president asked what steps the united states was taking to 
meet mulroneys concerns said well weve been trying to work 
on it 
mulroney described the issue as a very complicated 
transboundary problem and said i hope we get a solution i 
dont expect anything within moments but we have been making 
movement and we hope to make a lot more 
in his response to reagan at the welcoming ceremony mulroney 
said this as you said in quebec city mr president is a 
problem that belongs to both of us we must continue and we shall 
to work together for an equitable solution to this important 
challenge 
the two leaders first met in 1985 in quebec city then followed 
up with meetings in washington in 1986 and in ottawa last april at 
that meeting reagan said he would consider the prime ministers 
proposal for a bilateral accord on acid rain canada however is 
dissatisfied with the us followup to this commitment 
the prime minister said he continues to believe that an accord 
should be possible and gave the president some private ideas on 
what might be in the accord the senior administration official 
said the official said reagans reaction in effect was we will 
look at them 
at wednesdays meeting reagan gave his permission for canada to 
buy tightly held us nuclear submarine technology ottawa is 
considering the purchase of 10 or 12 nuclearpowered attack 
submarines either from britain or france 
because the british trafalgar class subs use american power 
plants us permission will be required if the canadians pick the 
british design 
the official said reagan informed mulroney that he would approve 
the technology transfer making canada the first nation outside 
britain to be eligible to acquire the technology action by 
congress is also required 
reagan and mulroney also discussed the pending free trade 
agreement between the united states and canada and said they do not 
believe it will be endangered by reagans threatened veto of a 
trade bill being considered in the senate the official reported 
reagan addressed mulroney as brian throughout the welcoming 
ceremony the prime minister addressed reagan as mr president 
and saluted him as a leader of warmth and directness 
turning to the trade agreement now pending before the canadian 
parliament and to be submitted to congress in june reagan 
predicted that both legislative bodies would approve it 
protectionism is out he said trade expansionism is in 
mulroney said both countries stand to gain from the measure 
which would reduce tariffs

four of hollywoods union health 
insurance funds spent 68 million by early this year on medical 
care for 138 aids patients a representative of producers and 
studios said wednesday 
because some aids insurance claims may be reported as related 
diseases rather than aids im sure these statistics are 
understated said j nicholas counter iii president of the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers 
despite the costs of caring for the entertainment industrys 
aids patients and the prospect of even more patients it appears 
we do have the resources to deal with the problem and will not go 
bankrupt in doing so counter said at a conference titled 
managing aids at work 
counters remarks represent the first time anyone has attempted 
to compile statistics on the number of aids patients whose care is 
being paid by health insurance funds serving the entertainment 
industrys five major unions 
the insurer providing coverage for one of those funds the 
american federation of television and radio artists health and 
retirement funds refused to provide statistics on the number of 
aftras 22000 members with aids or the cost of their care said 
alliance government affairs specialist dan goldberg who compiled 
the statistics for counter 
they four funds that provided figures are the screen actors 
guildproducers health fund which covers roughly 25000 guild 
members the motion picture industry health and welfare fund which 
covers about 20000 members of the international alliance of 
theatrical and stage employees the writers guild of america 
industry health fund which covers 4000 guild members and the 
directors guild of america pension and health and welfare fund 
which covers about 3000 union members not all union members are 
covered by the programs 
goldberg said that as of midfebruary 72 aids cases had been 
reported to the sag insurance fund 43 to iatses fund 14 to the 
writers guilds and nine to the directors guilds for a total of 
138 patients many of whom have died 
some people have suggested the incidence of aids in the 
entertainment industry might be high because of a disproportionate 
number of homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers and a greater 
number of sexual partners 
but counter said i dont see that this problem is any worse 
or any less in our industry than in all industries 
the 68 million figure cited by counter for the cost of care 
for 138 patients works out to just under 49500 per patient 
with efficient case management and progressive insurance 
company policies the cost per patient can be held in the 
neighborhood of 35000 to 50000 which is roughly comparable 
with the cost of treating cancer and heart disease patients 
counter said

stella nickell accused of killing her husband 
and a woman with cyanidelaced excedrin tearfully testified 
wednesday that she never talked of murdering her husband and 
researched poison only after his death 
mrs nickell described bruce nickell 52 as a loving 
goodnatured husband with a sense of humor she denied telling 
family members her marriage was unhappy or had grown boring since 
they both stopped drinking in 1979 
i believe that my feelings grew a lot stronger after the 
drinking stopped the 44yearold mrs nickell said we got along 
a lot better 
she acknowledged periodic financial problems and stress 
including filing for bankruptcy in 1983 but denied that money 
arguments had threatened the marriage or that she saw collecting on 
nickells life insurance as an easy solution 
the trial is the first in the nation involving a person charged 
with causing death by tampering with overthecounter medicine 
defense attorney tom hillier gently led his client through an 
emotional recounting of her husbands collapse in 1986 she sobbed 
earlier in the day as a pathologist described nickells autopsy 
on the night of his death he took four excedrin she said when 
hillier asked her why she quoted her husband as saying because 
thats what i need 
a few moments later she said he told her he felt like he was 
about to pass out 
he squatted down shook his head he wouldnt answer me he 
stood up put his hands on the couch to brace himself and 
collapsed she said 
mrs nickell denied the testimony of her daughter cindy 
hamilton that she had discussed several possible ways to kill her 
husband 
mrs nickell said she researched cyanide only after nickells 
death because i wanted to know what it was that killed my 
husband 
asked about testimony by an fbi specialist that 84 of her 
fingerprints were found on a book on poisonous plants called 
deadly harvest mrs nickell said she was trying to learn about 
such plants to protect her granddaughter and children she babysat 
from any dangers around her suburban auburn home 
she acknowledged she signed her husbands insurance forms 
saying he despised paperwork she said she thought he had 
25000 in life insurance 
prosecutors who are expected to crossexamine mrs nickell on 
thursday contend she hoped to collect on as much as 176000 in 
insurance 
they contend she put cyanide in other overthecounter pain 
relievers in order to make her husbands death appear the work of a 
random killer 
she is also accused in the death of sue katherine snow 40 of 
auburn who died after swallowing an excedrin capsule containing 
cyanide in 1986

that five of the arrested workers were beaten up by police 
the 11 arrested were demonstrating to show support for a 
twomonthold strike by about 1500 construction workers and auto

the strikers workers without a class conscience and unclear 
political aims adding that they should be holding these 
protests outside the us embassy 
ortega has blamed nicaraguas economic ills on the reagan 
administrations economic sanctions against the country and its 
support of contra rebels the guerrillas fought the sandinistas for 
6 years but recently signed a ceasefire accord 
there can be no doubt that those who have been carrying out a 
repressive policy causing economic difficulties and murdering 
people and the nicaraguan workers with its criminal and terrorist 
policy is reagan ortega said 
the federation which claims a membership of 100000 workers is 
one of the countrys biggest labor organizations and is closely

when dorothy day founder of the catholic worker 
movement died in 1980 a reporter asked one of her followers 
what will you do now 
bury her he said 
it was an answer day would have liked for her faith was in good 
works not personal charisma 
but catholics to whom she was a heroine will not be comforted by 
a new study which implies that the workers are burying their 
founder figuratively as well as literally 
in beyond charismatic leadership sister michele teresa 
aronica a sociologist who teaches at st josephs college in 
maine accuses some of days followers of straying from her radical 
commitment to serve the poor and promote pacifism 
with no dorothy day to guide it and no program for teaching 
new members about her life and philosophy the new york catholic 
worker runs the risk of becoming simply another social service 
agency aronica warns 
aronica spent several months in 1984 at the workers houses of 
hospitality on the impoverished lower east side of manhattan she 
describes a group at once too hierarchical to satisfy days 
insistence on individual responsibility yet too unorganized to 
preserve her memory 
and in an increasingly hostile and stressful environment the 
lower east side was being flooded with homeless people many of 
them addicts or former mental patients these folks were very 
concerned with trying to maintain the organization even at the 
expense of serving the poor she said in a telephone interview 
the changes aronica observed included watereddown soup in the 
famous catholic worker soup line and the use of a personal computer 
to mail the catholic worker newspaper 
one unhappy worker complained that the catholic worker used to 
have the reputation of being the best soup in the city but these 
young people decide they are going to experiment and do it their 
own way instead of learning to make a good stew 
its hot water man one homeless man complained who the 
hell wants to wait in line for that 
the catholic worker newspaper the movements voice and primary 
source of income is issued less frequently with contributions 
from fewer workers and day who valued manual labor and 
mistrusted technology would have been appalled by the purchase of 
a computer to address subscriptions some insisted 
aronica also found the worker had only a token commitment to 
pacifism and disarmament even though day opposed every war from 
benito mussolinis in ethiopia to lyndon johnsons in vietnam 
friday night meetings once dedicated to discussing the thought 
of day and worker cofounder peter maurin instead feature lectures 
on a variety of subjects with the result that the founders ideas 
are not systematically or consistently presented or discussed 
within the group 
aronica warns if the spirit or the vision is not passed on to 
the membership the catholic worker runs the risk of becoming just 
another one of the many facilities which offer services to the 
indigent 
she also complains that the theoretically anarchical worker is 
in fact governed by a leadership elite which decides who comes 
and who goes in theory anyone can join the worker in fact 
aronica reports street people were served but not treated as 
equals 
asked about aronicas study tim lambert managing editor of the 
catholic worker newspaper admitted we fail constantly to live 
dorothys vision but were still trying and her vision is still 
alive 
the adjustment to a founders death is something every 
movement has faced lambert said but so much time here is 
spent answering the knock on the door in that way theres a 
continuity that wont go away thats where our life is centered 
the newspaper circulation has dropped because the workers 
stopped distributing copies that were going unread he explained 
as for the soup he said the quality varies every morning its 
something different 
whatever the workers problems in new york the movement appears 
healthy outside the city there are at least 100 other worker 
groups around the country twice as many as when day was alive 
about 500 workers gathered in las vegas nev late last year for 
her 90th birthday a celebration that included a demonstration at a 
nuclear test site 
at any rate those particularly interested in the movements 
traditional center are offered some sound advice by a young 
volunteer aronica interviewed the only way to really get a sense 
of the worker is to come and see it

the actors portraying the terror aboard an 
airliner hijacked to lebanon sometimes used jokes to get through 
the tense emotional scenes says lindsay wagner who stars as 
courageous flight attendant uli derickson 
there are moments of humor said wagner of the nbc movie 
the taking of flight 847 the uli derickson story nbc will 
televise the twohour movie monday 
it was the only way to survive aboard the plane and when we 
did the heavy scenes wed break up trying to get through it the 
emotions would become so overpowering you had to have relief 
to an extent she said that was also one way the reallife 
hostages aboard the twa jet coped with fear after two terrorists 
seized the plane june 17 1985 on a flight from athens to rome 
it was derickson who emerged as a heroine during the hijacking 
in which the plane was diverted to beirut flew to algiers then 
returned to beirut she helped get some passengers released and 
attempted to conceal the identities of the jewish passengers 
one passenger a young navy frogman named robert stethem was 
beaten then shot to death by the terrorists the other passengers 
and crew were eventually released derickson was among those 
released early 
she was very human said wagner she ended up doing some 
extraordinary things there were times when she was crying and her 
hands were shaking but she didnt freeze up she pushed through 
her emotions one terrorist made her sing patty cake in german 
then proposed marriage to her 
most of the movie was filmed in a mockup of the airplanes 
cabin a small and cramped space 
they were never allowed off the plane she said we shot a 
few scenes at los angeles international airport including one 
where we had to use the emergency chute exit the entire fire 
department at the airport came and watched theyd never seen one 
used before 
we sometimes lost track of where we were algiers or beirut 
we filmed mostly in that little space you dont realize how much 
youre influenced by visual stimuli we kept asking ourselves 
where are we now algiers or beirut 
derickson who is still flying with twa was a consultant for 
the film 
i asked her things like what it was like moment to moment 
said wagner she was on the set if i had any questions for 
some things you can simply use your own instinct but when you had 
a choice i wanted her input she also relayed some of the little 
anecdotes she was very good in helping me create moments 
she passed out aspirin to the passengers to keep their body 
temperatures down the air conditioning was off and the plane was 
very hot in the desert sun she told me she thought she was doing a 
good job looking cool when a woman grabbed her arm and said i 
think you should take some too dear 
wagner is best known for the bionic woman which ran on abc 
from 1976 to 1978 she and lee majors who was the six million 
dollar man made a reunion movie last year for nbc her last 
series jessie lasted only briefly in 1984 
she said shed consider doing another series if its a 
halfhour comedy 
i dont want to do another hour show she said we havent 
been able to come up with the right property yet usually you have 
too much thats been one of the ironies of my career 
wagner was also in the miniseries scruples and princess 
daisy her theatrical films include the paper chase and 
high risk a caper movie that has become something of a cult 
classic

independent texas bankers are upset the 
government is providing unlimited coverage for first republicbank 
corps depositors although many also say the problems of the 
state biggest banking company have brought them increased deposits 
the discrimination caused by the fdics fully insuring first 
republicbank is bleeding all texas banks that are fortunate enough 
not to be in a failing condition top officials of the 
independent bankers association of texas said recently in a letter 
to william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
in the letter association executive director f hagen mcmahon 
jr and president scott smith of shermans american bank protested 
the unlimited insurance provision and a greater willingness by 
regulators to close ailing small banks rather than rescue them 
they accused the fdic of slandering and threatening the 
management of independent banks closed by regulators while public 
statements about first republicbanks troubles blamed outside 
economic forces rather than management 
let us point out that our bankers live in the same economy as 
the bankers working for first republicbank smith and mcmahon 
wrote 
normally the fdic insures individual deposits up to 100000 
fdic spokesman alan whitney said the fullinsurance solution for 
first republicbank was the best one under the circumstances to 
ensure the safety of the texas banking industry but he 
acknowledged the guarantee causes disparity among the states banks 
texas has 1400 independent banks each averaging 44 million in 
deposits according to figures compiled by the banking association 
of the 71 texas banks closed in 1987 and 1988 all but a handful 
were independent so a slight influx in deposits from troubled 
larger banks is small comfort to most independent bankers 
i would say that the independent banking community for the 
lack of a better word has benefited or our deposits have 
increased due to the problems that the larger banks are having 
said mcmahon 
last month the associations bankers reported they not only 
were gaining deposits from the first republicbank system but 
people were also moving safedeposit boxes 
any time that a customer will go to the trouble of moving his 
safedeposit box that is a good indication that core deposits are 
flowing into our banks not just temporary hotmoney movement 
mcmahon said 
but those added deposits could be a mixed blessing as demand for 
loans continues to drop in texas said stephen skaggs a vice 
president at alex sheshunoff amp co a leading bank consulting firm 
in austin 
it could be an opportunity for a financially healthy sound 
bank which has loan demand to profitably make use of the deposit 
growth that comes from the troubled banks in the state skaggs 
said but growth in and of itself without having a way to deploy 
those deposits is not necessarily advantageous 
if you dont have anywhere to put the money and suddenly you 
grow by 20 million then whats really the advantage 
but where loan demand does exist larger independents with money 
to lend hope they can fill the lending void left by ailing holding 
companies 
outofstate lenders are scared to make loans or invest here 
and the major texas people have their hands tied said richard 
ware ii president of amarillo national bank one of the states 
biggest independents 
wares bank owned and operated by his family for four 
generations works with other independents to assemble large loan 
deals that his bank with assets of 6308 million would not be 
able to do on its own 
ware said while his banks profits are down the bank remains 
profitable because its loan portfolio lacks the heavy exposure in 
real estate loans that burned it bigcity counterparts 
the rush toward real estate lending by most holding companies 
illustrates a strength of independent banking independent 
thinking he said 
this concentration of lenders all starts thinking one way 
and they all went into real estate lending and it got em ware 
said so i think theres some strength in the independent concept 
in that youre diversified you have different management you have 
different deposit bases thats a strength that will allow us to 
get through this

the traditionally camerashy justices of the 
supreme court are the subjects of a pbs documentary starting monday 
that gives viewers a look behind the scenes of the most secluded 
branch of government 
the marble temple as the supreme court building is called 
holds the offices of eight men and a woman who occasionally give 
formal interviews but never before have allowed television cameras 
to film them talking to each other about their work 
you get some sense of how they interact with each other 
said steve york executive producer of the twopart series created 
for the public broadcasting service by wetatv in washington 
while the general public may not be duly impressed by such 
access said york to those who spend a lot of time really 
seasoned court watchers scholars and reporters it is a very big 
deal 
the twohour this honorable court will be shown in two 
parts the second on monday may 9 air dates and times can vary on 
local pbs stations 
the first segment explores the history of the court using 
archival film footage and interviews with legal experts to create 
an engaging story about its growth from seeming insignificance in 
the early days of the republic to a powerful and active third 
branch of government 
for the casual viewer it is the easier of the two segments to 
watch a concise history lesson that demonstrates how the court has 
changed itself and society 
one portion shows thurgood marshall now a senior justice as 
the young civil rights attorney who brought brown vs the board of 
education to the court and helped change forever the governments 
position on the treatment of blacks in public facilities 
the first hour also delves into the politics behind the 
appointment of the individual justices and the battles between the 
presidents and the court 
it covers the controversy over president franklin roosevelts 
effort to pack the court when it ruled against new deal 
legislation the attempt by president nixon to turn the warren 
court into a more conservative body and president reagans problems 
with his nomination of robert bork 
in the second hour the series takes on a deeply respectful tone 
and reporternarrator paul duke avoids controversy in his questions 
to the justices 
the justices do not talk about pending cases or the politics 
of the court said producer york when its a given they are 
not going to talk about it and you know they arent let them talk 
about what they will talk about there is enough there to give you 
a sense of how the court works that never has been discussed 
before 
indeed there is nothing in the series to rile the justices 
chief justice william rehnquist at a reception before excerpts 
of the series were previewed praised the producers for pursuing 
the program in an understanding thoughtful and careful way 
all of the members of the court family think that weta did a 
remarkably good job in making this film he said 
later after the viewing he said it has a sense of humanity 
about it 
im not a tv star retired justice lewis powell said while 
adding i think it will be very informative 
i thought it was all right i didnt mind it at all said 
justice byron white 
york credits rehnquist for making the court so accessible to the 
film crew and duke mentions that the chief justice has often been 
praised for bringing a new openness to the court 
generally the tone of the program is serious as the justices 
discuss their attitudes about their job but an occasional light 
exchange spills through 
york said that during the year he worked on the series he was 
impressed by the respect the justices show for one another despite 
deep differences in philosophy 
you realized the way the justices get along with each other 
does affect the process he said

but partner brian d young who joined odyssey two years ago 
pointed to the firms track record of holding onto its investments 
unlike other investment companies that might feel pressed to turn a 
quick buck 
odyssey will leave the running of the stevens businesses to 
division managers and no layoffs are expected young said 
the partnership has stakes valued at about 350 million in 50 
private and public companies that cover the waterfront from a bus 
manufacturer to a furniture retailer to supermarkets to real estate 
to an insurance company among others 
you will see mature businesses in the portfolio not 
startups and you wont see hightech said r todd lang a new 
york attorney who has had a 20year relationship with nash and levy 
indeed odysseys investment credo as stated in a privately 
circulated brochure is to avoid a company whose principal 
product it does not understand 
the partnership looks for strong management undervalued assets 
and a defendable market position the company says in its 1988 
brochure analysts agree that stevens assets generally fit the 
criteria 
they must be relying on a projection that these businesses are 
really going to take off said one source close to the stevens 
transaction 
analysts note that odyssey is familiar with the fabric and home 
furnishings industries the partnership owns 21 percent of leslie 
fay companies inc one of the largest makers of womens clothing 
in the united states and it has stakes in childrens apparel 
makers brinlaw co and mampl international co and liberty fabrics 
which makes knitted fabrics 
nash and levy met in the early 1950s at the new york investment 
firm oppenheimer amp co where they built up the mutual funds and 
brokerage operations in 1982 oppenheimer sold its subsidiaries in 
the financial services industry and left the duo with about 50 
million to set up their own investment boutique which they dubbed 
odyssey in an allusion to their risky journey into uncharted 
opportunities 
the firms 90 limited partners have seen an impressive return on 
their money the deal side is only part of odysseys business 
the partnership also manages about 500 million in marketable 
securities 
levy nash and their partners avoid the press were a private 
firm young said in a rare interview we all came from public 
firms and one reason were here is we like our privacy 
according to young we say what we are legally required to 
say but that doesnt mean people need to know what goes on at 
odyssey 
those who know them say levy 62 and nash 58 are perfect 
partners levy has been described as a visionary whose mind wanders 
out beyond the year 2000 while nashs feet are firmly planted in 
the hereandnow 
it was levy who five years ago spotted the chicago milwaukee 
corp parent of a bankrupt railroad the company emerged from 
bankruptcy and was pretty much dismembered leaving odyssey with 48 
percent of a company that now is comprised mostly of cash 
securities and real estate rumored to be valued at 400 million 
levy also singled out monarch capital corp a springfield 
mass financial services firm specializing in life and disability 
insurance because he was convinced variable life insurance was the 
product of the future 
we were the only public company out there in the variable life 
insurance business in 1983 said monarch chairman gordon oakes 
odysseys stake is valued at about 28 million oakes said 
preferring to work with management on friendly terms odyssey 
typically suggests leveraged buyouts but the partners have not 
always been met with open arms 
earlier this month odyssey reported to the securities and 
exchange commission that it might seek control of unc inc an 
annapolis mdbased defense firm in which it holds a 58 percent 
stake 
the filing came after the partners approached unc management 
about a leveraged buyout at prices that didnt seem to benefit 
shareholders said one source close to the company 
after the filing unc president dan colussy called odysseys 
statement about a potential takeover unfortunate adding that 
the company regards such statements as extremely disruptive and 
harmful to uncs business 
as for odysseys atypical entry into a bidding war with 
pepperell over stevens one source close to the partnership said 
most sophisticated money groups have to participate in these 
auctions or theres no deals to do these days 
friends of odyssey are still defending the companys skirmish 
with transworld corp which began in 1982 as ahead of its 
time 
at the time levy was talking about disaggregation a concept 
he described in a 1983 fortune magazine article as liberating a 
conglomerates operating companies as a way of realizing their 
values and improving their efficiency 
after an unsuccessful proxy fight in which odyssey proposed 
converting transworld divisions into independent companies the 
partners had lunch with thenchairman l edwin smart there was a 
degree of gentlemanliness to the meeting and a degree of wanting 
to throw another thought on the table smart recalled 
a year after its runin with odyssey the company spun off its 
airline subsidiary trans world airlines inc to concentrate on 
its food and lodgings operations the company which later sold 
other assets is now known as tw services inc 
though the proxy fight occurred years ago smart vividly 
remembers his encounter with odyssey obviously theyre very 
intelligent people and they are also very aggressive people he 
said

born poor in greenville sc 46 years ago 
jesse jackson has capitalized on his role as the nations most 
prominent black leader to maintain a comfortable lifestyle and 
accumulate sizable wealth all without holding elected office or 
drawing a regular paycheck 
he has kept busy even without his portfolio as leader of 
operation push the civil rights group he founded and led until 
before his 1984 presidential campaign 
in recent years his income has run into six figures and before 
his current campaign jackson traveled the world far and wide 
acquiring foreign policy experience during trips financed in large 
part by black church groups and business supporters and in some 
measure by sympathetic political groups or foreign nations 
the democratic contenders most recent financial disclosure 
form which presidential candidates are required to submit shows 
he had assets worth a minimum of 347010 and possibly much more 
he owns modest houses in chicagos sand to south korea where he visited 
dissident leader kim daejung who was under house arrest at the 
time 
rev joseph ahne a chicago pastor who helped organize the trip 
said the air fare and other expenses for jackson and five others 
were paid by a coalition of human rights groups from japan the 
south korean leg of the trip was paid for by that countrys 
national council of churches ahne said 
usually when we go abroad we are the guests of some human 
rights organization or some church or are at the courtesy of some 
government jackson said or if we must pay we simply target 
the money for that particular trip and raise it

during his 1984 presidential campaign for instance jackson 
raised the money for two major trips to latin america he traveled 
to mexico city in june 1984 and to panama el salvador nicaragua 
and cuba the following month 
neither trip was paid for by jacksons presidential campaign 
supporters were asked instead to donate to a humanitarian fund 
set up by campaign attorney edward coaxum jackson said 
coaxum a cleveland attorney didnt return repeated telephone 
calls seeking further information and jackson spokesman watkins 
said he didnt know how much the fund raised or whether it was 
incorporated 
it isnt unusual for public figures to travel abroad at someone 
elses expense foreign governments frequently invite congressmen 
by themselves or in delegations to visit and absorb the costs 
candidates sometimes use funds from their political action 
committees for trips that burnish their foreign policy credentials 
while jackson has traveled abroad extensively he apparently 
hasnt drawn a regular salary since stepping down as the head of 
push in 1983 to wage his first presidential campaign according to 
his financial disclosure forms and push financial records 
from 1978 through 1980 he was paid about 50000 a year as the 
national president of push he received 54615 in both 1981 and 
1982 the last year that he drew a salary from the organization 
according to push records filed with the illinois attorney 
generals office 
in 1983 jackson made about 115000 according to income tax 
returns that he released during his 1984 presidential campaign of 
that 1983 income jackson earned 37342 in speaking honoraria 
jackson has parlayed his charismatic style into a prominent 
source of income on the lecture circuit since his 1984 campaign 
according to his financial disclosure statement filed with the 
federal election commission 
in august 1984 he started personalities international inc a 
company run out of his chicago home to receive his speaking fees 
and other income according to his attorney john bustamante 
jackson was paid 192090 by personaliministration simply doesnt want 
a trade bill thats 
the long and the short of it senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva declared now the president can run but he cant 
hide hes going to get a bill 
senate passage of the bill produced by a housesenate conference 
committee was a foregone conclusion the question was whether 
democrats could win the twothirds support needed to override the 
threatened veto but there also was a question of whether that 
margin would hold up during a future vote to override president 
reagans veto 
the administration and the democratic leadership went down to 
the wire with lobbying efforts but the race appeared too close to 
call lawmakers said 
reagan renewed his veto threat and promised to work later for a 
milder version in a letter tuesday to senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan 
reagan called on lawmakers to finish the trade bill process in 
a way that serves americas interests not the special interests 
most administration fire has been directed at a provision that 
would require all but the smallest companies to provide their 
employees with 60day notice of plant closings and largescale 
layoffs 
sen edward m kennedy dmass defended the embattled 
plantclosings provision saying 40000 plants have shut down in 
this decade of increased foreign competition 
nearly 2 million people have lost their jobs each year 
kennedy said yet the administration does not want workers to 
know their jobs are in danger and to have time to plan for new ways 
to provide for their families 
the administration dangled the prospect of a slimmed down 
version of the bill minus the plantclosings and perhaps other 
provisions once congress has sustained reagans expected veto of 
the current measure 
but democratic leaders said this could be the last chance to 
support trade legislation before the fall election campaign 
the house passed the bill last thursday 312107 more than 
enough to override a veto 
the bill would overhaul the system under which the united states 
imposes import curbs and takes other steps to retaliate against 
international trade violations and other unfair practices 
authority to retaliate would be transferred from the president 
to the us trade representative retaliation would be mandatory 
but the bill provides five broadly phrased exceptions such as 
threats to national security 
main provisions also streamline the means by which the united 
states imposes import restrictions to protect american businesses 
threatened by surges in import competition 
but the 1000page measure contains hundreds of additional 
provisions ranging from billions of dollars in agricultural 
subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies 
government aid to workers left jobless by import competition 
would be expanded trade sanctions would be imposed on japans 
toshiba corp one of its subsidiaries and the norwegian company of 
kongsberg vapenfabrikk for sale of submarine silencing equipment to 
the soviet union 
the measure would assist americans in defending themselves 
against bribery charges brought under the foreign corrupt practices 
act because of payments made by their agents overseas it would 
ease some export curbs on hightech equipment subject to 
restriction because of its potential military uses 
a maze of minor provisions governs trade in everything from 
cranberries to canteloupes 
democratic leaders gave up efforts wednesday to win support from 
alaskas republican senators by unsnarling a dispute over the 
measures curbs on export of north slope oil byrd said attempts to 
resolve the matter ran into procedural roadblocks 
several republicans have expressed irritation at the 
administrations heavy focus on the plantclosings provision as the 
reason to oppose the bill 
frankly some of us think there ought to be a stronger 
reason dole told reporters wednesday it puts republicans on 
the side at least the perception out there of being against the 
poor working man and women who get only fourday notice 
the administration supported by a number of business groups 
has been contending that the measure would actually blunt the 
nations trade competitive edge rather than sharpen it

a little more than a year ago in the 
darkest days of winter laura lynn lazarovich lay in a hospital bed 
fighting for life 
her skull was fractured her right side paralyzed her right arm 
and collarbone snapped like twigs two front teeth had been gouged 
out both her hazel eyes were swollen shut dried blood caked her 
lips and her body was mottled with bruises from forehead to ankles 
a monitor watched over her heart intravenous tubes sprouted 
from her pitifully broken body 
laura lynn was 2 years old 
prosecutors say her tormentors were her parents 
moreover this was the childs third fractured skull in 28 
months laura lynn was a double victim not only of especially 
brutal beatings but also of a bureaucratic bungle that returned 
her home for the last almost fatal attack 
even as assault charges were pending in new jersey against her 
parents roger and janice lazarovich a family court judge there 
had ordered her returned from the temporary custody of her maternal 
grandparents to the lazaroviches in massachusetts 
now the law has caught up with the lazaroviches who had laura 
lynn and two sons over three years moved three times from three 
states and were divorced in february 
today both are in jail lazarovich 25 is serving 1520 years 
after his conviction for mayhem and assault his 23yearold wife 
who had been scheduled to stand trial on the same charges may 2 
won a delay last week and will be tried in september 
superior court judge charles alberti with 16 years on the 
bench said in sentencing laura lynns father i dont know if 
ive dealt with a case by virtue of this childs tender years 
where the child has been more brutalized 
the two still face extradition to new jersey on two counts of 
aggravated assault according to camden county prosecutor sam 
asbell 
the lazaroviches drove 20 miles through heavy snow that 
saturday jan 24 1987 to bring their unconscious daughter from 
their western massachusetts trailer home to a pittsfield hospital 
they said she had fallen off her potty seat according to court 
papers 
but prosecutors said she had been beaten for more than a week 
court papers said she was bitten choked and her head slammed 
repeatedly into a countertop from about jan 16 to jan 24 
laura lynns maternal grandmother pamela christopher could not 
recognize the battered child when she visited her in the hospital 
several days later she didnt look like the little girl who had 
left us recalled mrs christopher who with her husband arthur 
had cared for the girl about a year 
mrs christopher asked if she could hold her thinking it might 
be for the last time i questioned whether she would live she 
recalled they had to prop her up to put her in my lap 
laura lynn spent eight months in the hospital and a boston 
rehabilitation center upon her release in september the courts 
granted the massachusetts department of social services temporary 
custody of the girl and her brothers anthony 2 and timothy 1 
laura lynn was placed in a foster home in western massachusetts 
her brothers are together in another home in the same region the 
lazaroviches have not been granted visitation rights and say they 
do not know their childens whereabouts no allegation of abuse of 
the boys was ever raised 
laura lynn is doing remarkably well said joseph landolfi a 
spokesman for the social service department the boys are in very 
good shape 
medical experts testified that laura lynn suffered permanent 
damage in the beating including partial paralysis of her right arm 
and loss of peripheral vision in her left eye 
after her release from the hospital she began showing signs of 
post traumatic stress disorder which is most commonly seen among 
combat veterans who relive war experiences and exhibit anxiety 
irritability and rage 
in laura lynns case she took to hitting kicking and biting 
her foster parents in court records a psychologist who treated 
laura lynn last december quoted the child as saying i dont like 
mummy mummy hurts me mummy pinches me and kicks me and hits the 
wall with me of her father she was quoted as saying wheres 
my very bad daddy 
cynthia monahon the psychologist said laura lynns recovery 
from injury has been encouraging and she has made unexpectedly 
rapid developmental gains because of her resilience and 
extraordinary care by her foster parents she said laura lynn is 
severely traumatized and has just begun to deal with the 
psychological impact of her abuse 
while she has formed solid attachments in her new family and 
takes enormous pleasure in her new life laura remains an anxious 
demanding and at times oppositional little girl whose functioning 
ranges from 2to2 years of age the psychologist wrote laura 
lynn will be 4 on aug 19 
roger and janice lazarovich were each adopted at the age of 20 
months roger by john and marilyn lazarovich of norwood mass 
south of boston and janice by the christophers who live near 
camden nj across the delaware river from philadelphia both 
were bright but few other childhood similarities exist the 
christophers considered their daughters marriage a mismatch 
both roger and social workers describe his childhood as 
tumultuous he was given to exchanging blows and insults with his 
mother petty thefts and setting fires at home and at school

he was locked in his room at night to keep him from stealing 
ran away from home became a ward of the state and went through 
half a dozen foster homes he was sent to a juvenile center 
dropped out of high school joined the navy when he was 18 served 
only seven months and found work pumping gas and fixing cars 
i was not the most gregarious foster child disobeying the 
household rules or not getting along as well as expected or 
demanded he said in an interview 
mrs lazarovich declined to be interviewed but a new jersey 
social worker wrote in a january 1986 background report that she 
was raised by a strong assertive mother and successful businessman 
father 
according to janice the report said she was taught to be 
seen and not heard kept in a state of dependency and not allowed 
to grow up although jan speaks very intelligently she 
exhibits very little emotion 
according to another report from a massachusetts social worker 
janice tends to hold things in and then explode 
janice was the first of three adopted children the christophers 
also adopted a korean boy scott who will graduate from the us 
naval academy this year and his older sister holly lazarovich 
said his wife had felt that holly two years her senior got 
special treatment 
jan admitted that when you go from being the only child to the 
middle of three there are some problems arthur christopher said 
in an interview but she didnt have any outstanding problems 
and she loves both holly and scott in fact she was the big wheel 
she was their translator they arrived here neither one of them 
speaking english 
roger and janice met in the fall of 1983 while she was a 
freshman at wheelock college and dating a friend of his they 
married little more than a month later on nov 29 1983 janice 
18 and already pregnant with laura lynn was planning a career in 
child and family services when she dropped out in her first 
semester to marry roger then 20 
we saw a lot of ourselves in each other lazarovich said 
janice wasnt happy with her past i wasnt happy with my past 
we probably felt sorry for each other it was a marriage of pity 
almost from birth laura lynn was a tragic figure her skull was 
fractured the first time sept 22 1984 when she was 5 weeks old 
and the lazaroviches were renting an apartment in winslow township 
nj said asbell the camden county prosecutor 
four weeks later on oct 19 authorities determined her skull 
had been fractured a second time and that her left leg was broken 
the state placed laura lynn in a foster home 
some experts familiar with the case said they believed she 
suffered some developmental delay she received therapy at a 
haddonfield nj learning center until the summer of 1985 by 
which time she had been placed with her maternal grandparents 
criminal charges of aggravated assault and endangering the 
welfare of a child were filed against the lazaroviches on july 12 
1985 but the couple had already fled new jersey leaving laura 
lynn behind moving first to ossipee nh then to foxboro mass 
then to plainfield mass 
we ran away lazarovich said the excuse from the 
landlord was we werent getting along with our neighbors and we 
got an eviction notice it seemed to be fallout from what happened 
with laura word seems to travel pretty quick and undesirables are 
undesirables no matter how you look at it 
nine months later on april 9 1986 with sufficient evidence in 
hand the new jersey grand jury finally indicted the couple whose 
whereabouts nevertheless remained unknown when the lazaroviches 
failed to appear for their arraignment may 15 authorities issued 
fugitive arrest warrants 
three weeks earlier however judge robert gladden of camden 
county family court had already ruled that laura lynn could live 
with her parents in massachusetts although new jersey would retain 
official custody the hearing was held with the consent of the new 
jersey division of youth and family services but without the 
knowledge of asbell the prosecutor 
laura lynn was sent to massachusetts but mrs lazarovich had 
difficulty loving laura lynn after the 18month separation 
according to a social workers report the parents compared her to 
her brother tony and were much prouder of the boy the report 
said laura lynn was jealous 
asbell acknowledged the case fell through the cracks 
absolutely he said it was one of those situations where 
the right hand and the left hand are not working together when the 
judge had a hearing the division of youth and family services 
never notified us the judge also did not have the benefit of our 
investigation so he granted the return of the child that has 
subsequently been corrected so that there should be no 
communication screwups anymore 
lazarovich who maintains he is innocent says something 
positive has to come out of the tragedy 
child abuse is a cycle he said abused children become 
abusive parents and the cycle continues i dont want to read 
someday about a laura lynn smith or whatever her last name is 
going to be up on charges of mayhem herself

the last big trouble at the normally tranquil 
bowen homes housing project in northwest atlanta came in 1981 when 
a daycare centers boiler exploded and so did angry parents and 
other residents 
so when a rock and bottlethrowing melee broke out among people 
gathered to watch a runofthemill traffic arrest march 30 city 
hall knew something was very wrong 
at least four people all black in atlantas poorer 
neighborhoods have been shot to death by police in eight months 
prompting accusations of excessive deadly force 
residents already afraid of drugrelated violence are now 
growing fearful of a police force that is also trying to fight more 
crime with fewer officers some predict the resentment thats 
simmered for years in poor mostly black sections is about to boil 
over 
fueling the fire is the fact that although the police force and 
government of this shiny southern city are controlled by blacks 
there have been few prosecutions and no convictions in these 
incidents 
atlantas gonna explode said city council member hosea 
williams who has worked with the families and neighbors of police 
shooting victims its bad out there right now with police its 
explosive 
these people are talking about getting their guns out 
williams said theyve started ignoring me cursing me calling 
me an uncle tom they say we dont care theyre killing us 
anyhow 
tensions between blacks and police have risen this year 
elsewhere too 
in dallas a homeless mentally ill man shot a police officer to 
death with his own service revolver and later was killed by police 
in los angeles blacks living amid gang violence complained that 
police took no strong action against the gangs until a suburban 
woman was killed 
in the last six weeks in atlanta police cars were pelted with 
rocks and broken bottles in two housing projects and mayor andrew 
young was berated at two community meetings for neglecting the 
citys disadvantaged 
public safety commissioner george napper asserted that reports 
of growing dissatisfaction with police are rumors spread by drug 
dealers who want antipolice sentiment at a pitch so drug traffic 
can thrive 
it ends up with us right in the middle of a situation that we 
didnt create napper said in an interview what youve got is 
so many damned drugs out there in the street that its a moral 
shame 
theyre not doing anything but trying to use the drugs as a 
coverup williams said its a shame that we have a police 
department like we do here 
the rev joseph lowery president of the southern christian 
leadership conference says he is not surprised when residents in 
poorer neighborhoods vent frustrations on police there have been 
too many instances where the same officers are involved in 
disrespect and abuse he said 
he said his office tries to keep lists of officers whose names 
surface repeatedly in reports of excessive force against blacks 
but receives little cooperation from the police department 
one case of multiple offenses involved officer ridley watson 
who was fired last month after napper cited eight to 10 excessive 
force complaints filed against him 
watson was one of two officers involved in the sept 10 shooting 
death of eddie lee callahan in atlantas carver homes housing 
project callahan who was black was shot six times in the back 
and side at pointblank range as he struggled with watson over his 
gun watson and his partner both white were trying to arrest 
callahan on suspicion of car theft 
napper declined to comment in detail about watsons case which 
is being appealed to the citys civil service board his office 
would not be more specific about the number of complaints against 
watson 
they are trying to establish a fact in the minds of young 
blacks if we try to apprehend you and you resist or run we are 
going to shoot and kill you williams said and the police are 
killing young black males who are already the most repressed 
individuals in our society in a city that is controlled by 
blacks 
young received a 90minute tonguelashing from carver homes 
residents about safety and housing issues in april when he visited 
there for what was supposed to be an antidrug pep talk with 
children 
he was on the receiving end of a similar attack at a meeting in 
the poole creek neighborhood where baxter lee williams 23 was 
shot to death by police feb 27 police say williams pulled a 
pistol but no weapon was confiscated witnesses said williams was 
holding a beer can 
when you see people attacking the mayor like that they have 
completely lost faith in the police department williams said 
everybody know aint nobody gonna draw no beer can on no police 
so the police know they can kill a black man and not get indicted 
for it 
napper however strongly disagreed theres not one shred of 
evidence to suggest that people who are involved in any of the 
situations with the police was not doing anything they were doing 
something if theres any evidence to indicate that officers were 
just thumping on people for no reason at all then theres no room 
in this police bureau for that kind of behavior or for those kind 
of officers 
mary sanford president of the tenants association of perry 
homes a northwest atlanta housing project that was rocked three 
years ago when a resident died while in police custody said while 
relations with police in her community are not perfect there is 
not a lot of resentment 
theres a percentage thats antipolice about 2 or 3 
percent she said most of the people who commit crimes at perry 
homes are not residents she said 
napper said police plan to address community concerns in much 
the same manner as they always have with more meetings scheduled 
to start this month officers recently began a crackdown on drug 
activity in atlantas housing projects 
bowen homes resident brenda weems said she wasnt sure nappers 
planned meetings would be effective since people in her 
neighborhood do not cooperate with police 
i see police officers out here i see them at night most of 
the time and if you call them they usually come she said 
they just have to have some cooperation and i dont think they 
are going to get that out here

the government says the economys 23 percent annual growth rate 
in the first three months of 1988 should erase lingering 
predictions of a postcrash recession but financial markets 
apparently arent convinced this is good news 
strong spending by american consumers a surge in business 
investment and growing exports kept the gross national product 
rising despite declines in government spending and a housing 
construction slump the commerce department said tuesday 
it was the governments first look at overall economic 
performance this year and was widely anticipated because of 
earlier fears that the october stock market crash portended a 
severe economic slowdown 
so much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the 
first quarter said commerce undersecretary robert ortner 
whatever the impact of the crash was its pretty much behind 
us 
the gnp report substantiated other signs of strength that had 
accumulated through the quarter notably higher rates of 
employment factory production and exports of manufactured goods 
beryl sprinkel president reagans chief economic adviser told 
a white house briefing on the gnp report that the economy is on 
track for moderate further expansion and for restrained inflation 
in 1988 
but financial markets showed little enthusiasm for the gnp 
report partly because it did not alleviate fears that the economy 
might be growing too rapidly in the view of investors in stocks 
and bonds this means inflation is still a potential threat and 
could mean higher interest rates later this year 
in the bond market a key barometer of the direction in interest 
rates there was only mild reaction to the gnp number the price of 
the 30year treasury bond was unchanged and its yield which moves 
inversely to price stayed at 9 percent 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials crept up 
879 points to 204476 in light trading in foreign exchange 
dealings the dollar was mixed 
the administration which is looking for a sixth straight year 
of economic growth to boost chances for a republican presidential 
win in november has forecast that gnp will grow 29 percent for 
the full year 
in another report the government said that aftertax corporate 
profits rose 26 percent in the final three months of 1987 this 
was an upward revision from a month ago when the government had 
calculated a 16 percent increase

technical factors and talk of possible output 
cuts by opec and nonopec producers have boosted oil futures prices 
contracts for june delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude settled at 1860 per barrel up 20 cents 
from mondays close on the new york mercantile exchange 
among may contracts for refined products wholesale unleaded 
gasoline closed at 5242 cents per gallon up 037 cent while 
wholesale heating oil settled 083 cent higher at 5204 cents per 
gallon 
the move up stemmed mainly from technical factors according to 
chris mccormack an analyst at the drexel burham lambert inc 
securities firm 
he said trading was apathetic until the crude contract drifted 
higher than the market expected at which point buyers stepped in 
traders also nervously were watching meetings in vienna 
austria between officials of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries and rival producers over ways of tightening 
world supplies to boost prices 
buying increased somewhat after word hit the market that seven 
independent oilproducing nations had decided to offer opec a 5 
percent cut in their oil exports as a gesture of support mccormack 
said 
a 5 percent cut for all independent producers would amount to a 
reduction in exports of roughly 200000 barrels a day 
production cuts if implemented would be expected to push up 
oil prices at least temporarily by bringing supplies closer in 
line with demand 
the two sides consisted of opecs price monitoring committee 
comprised of the oil ministers of saudi arabia indonesia 
venezuela nigeria and algeria and representatives from noncartel 
producers mexico colombia egypt angola oman malaysia brunei 
and china 
the price committee was to present the proposal to the full

the associated press reported incorrect figures 
monday for the closing dow jones averages of 30 industrial stocks 
20 transportation stocks and the composite of 65 stocks the 
averages were incorrect because prices of two component stocks 
cocacola co and usair group inc were wrong 
the closing dow jones 30 should have been 203597 up 2088 
the dow jones transportation average should have been 85335 up 
568 and the composite of 65 stocks should have been 75821 up 
614 
the problem with the dow jones industrial average was that the 
new york stock exchange reported a trade of 1000 shares of coca 
cola at a price of 39 then erroneously corrected that to make the 
price 39 the actual price was 38 but the nyses dataprocessing 
subsidiary has no way to correct a correction automatically the 
correction was made manually which was not read by the ap computer 
that produces the stock lists and computes the dow jones averages 
the incorrect price of 39 was used in figuring the dow 
industrial average which caused it and the composite 65 to be 
wrong 
in the other error the nyse corrected a price of 33 for usair 
to put the trade into proper sequence that trade occurred at 402 
pm a trade of 34 a share took place two minutes later and in 
fact was the final trade of the day but the ap computer read the 
33 price as the last and that was used in figuring the dow jones 
transportation average and the composite 65

when evan andrews fell in love with 
businessschool classmate jesse moore he didnt discover until 
later that she was an illegal inside trader whats worse she got 
her illicit stock tips from his future boss 
cant you make an honest living he asked in a 
confrontation she replied you know that this kind of thing goes 
on all the time 
the fictional characters conflict is the subject of legal 
tender a new 20minute color video to be used in ethics classes 
at the stanford university graduate business school and possibly 
other schools 
its something that really hits home said stanford student 
alan jacobs who conceived and produced the film it features 
professional actors and cost 40000 to make with most of the 
money donated by corporate sponsors 
jacobs showed the video to a recent conference of graduate 
business students at northwestern university and got an 
enthusiastic response 
he said ethics professors at several other institutions have 
expressed strong interest in getting copies partly because they 
have little material for teaching business ethics a rapidly 
growing part of many mba programs 
virtually all the existing material is in the form of written 
cases jacobs 29 said in an interview they are good at 
providing the student with a wealth of detail about situations 
what theyre weaker at is conveying the emotion and pressure and 
confusion that goes with the situations 
thomas l dunfee an ethics professor at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton business school said jacobs project was 
part of a broader trend toward using video to dramatize ethical 
issues for student discussion wharton and harvard business school 
also have undertaken such projects he said 
i think that is a provocative way to do it i certainly will 
take a look at the one produced at stanford to see if it will work 
here dunfee said i think as part of a package it makes sense 
to show these kinds of things 
james kuhn a columbia business school professor who specializes 
in ethical issues said he had talked with jacobs and also was 
impressed with the questions raised by the video story 
the problem raised in legal tender is left unresolved 
intentionally to provoke class discussion about whether the 
fictional andrews should leave his girlfriend squeal on his 
prospective employer or keep quiet whether she is willing to 
change also deliberately is left vague 
jacobs who wants to get into the film business when he 
graduates said he devised the plot last year for a class 
assignment that asked students to describe an ethical dilemma in 
business he borrowed from events that range from the wall street 
insider trading scandal to company whistleblowers whove been 
fired and thought putting it on film was the natural next step 
jacobs even used a line that was once attributed to dennis 
levine the former investment banker whose insider trading 
violations spawned the scandal nearly two years ago when you 
work in a deli you take home pastrami 
shot mostly on stanfords campus the cast is a mix of business 
students and professionals including a paid director 
cinematographer and the main characters who are portrayed as 
attractive intelligent and ambitious 
in order to really care about a situation you really have to 
care about the people involved jacobs said what i think we 
were able to accomplish is to get the students involved enough in 
the characters so they can see themselves 
jacobs said he might sell legal tender for a small fee to 
get wider distribution but doesnt intend to profit from the film

a couple of milestones on the current calendar 
seem likely to pass without much celebration among american 
taxpayers 
one is the 75th anniversary of the federal income tax which was 
created in 1913 by the 16th amendment to the constitution 
the other is tax freedom day a calculation created and 
popularized by the tax foundation a nonprofit research 
organization in washington 
according to the foundations economists this year the 
average american would work from jan 1 through may 4 to furnish 
federal state and local tax collectors with the funds to pay all 
taxes if every cent earned from the first of the year went for 
taxes 
on may 5 americans finally start working for themselves 
as it happens may 5 is the latest date for tax freedom day 
since people began keeping records on this sort of thing counting 
the extra day in february that comes in a leap year it extends two 
days past 1987s may 4 
not all the tax money comes directly out of consumers 
pocketbooks or paychecks half the social security tax for 
example is nominally paid by employers rather than employees 
but the tax foundation counts the full amount reasoning that 
sooner or later the american worker ultimately pays the total 
tax burden including business taxes which are passed on to 
individuals in his or her capacity as an employee proprietor or 
investor 
psychologically the timing of tax freedom day 1988 is 
unfortunate coming just on the heels of the unpleasant surprises 
many people got in april as they settled their accounts with uncle 
sam for 1987 
when he saw the bottom line on his return raymond f devoe jr 
a professional financial analyst recalls thinking this cant be 
right we were supposed to have reform 
many commentators see a special irony in the tax foundations 
computations for 1988 the last of the eightyear presidency of 
ronald reagan after all reagan came to office on a wave of 
taxcutting hopes and promises 
but as the foundation notes the tax reductions of 1981 have 
been steadily whittled away by a parade of subsequent changes 
it observed the us taxpayer has now lost all the ground 
gained through the major cuts of the economic recovery tax act of 
1981 
with subsequent rule changes and increases in social security 
taxes it says like the cheshire cat in alice in wonderland 
nothing remains but the smile 
the frustration of course is compounded by the realization 
that the tax payments being made do not come close to covering the 
cost of government as reflected in the budget deficit 
sheldon jacobs publisher of a mutualfund advisory letter 
suggests that beyond what you have paid you owe the treasury 
1856910 thats every taxpayers portion of the national debt 
forecasts abound of further moves to increase federal taxes in 
the next year or two as the government struggles to get the budget 
under control 
if the tax burden is mounting that would seem to put added 
emphasis on careful tax planning for those on whom it falls but 
again thanks to tax reform some of the familiar tools used in that 
planning are no longer of much use 
when the accounting firm of laventhol amp horwath examined a 
sampling of 1987 returns it prepared for clients in four large 
cities it found that less than 5 percent made contributions to 
individual retirement accounts 
the tax deduction for those contributions has been reduced or 
eliminated for many middle to upperincome taxpayers 
all this is enough to prompt observers like devoe and jacobs to 
take a nostalgic look back at the first year of the income tax 
threequarters of a century ago the tax rate for all but the 
wealthiest americans was 1 percent and more than 99 percent of the 
populace had to pay nothing at all

republican votes to demonstrate the twothirds support required to 
override a presidential veto 
no hard counts were available but lawmakers were universal in 
saying that whichever side prevailed would have few if any votes to 
spare 
byrd also said lawmakers were deceiving themselves if they were 
certain that once reagan made good on his repeated veto threats 
there would be quick passage of a streamlined version minus the 
most controversial features 
another bill is not wired and those who are gambling on that 
are gambling on a weak reed byrd said 
reagan renewed the veto threat tuesday calling on lawmakers in 
a letter to dole to finish the trade bill process in a way that 
serves americas interests not the special interests 
meanwhile minority leader bob dole rkan told reporters he 
will continue to fight the bill but believes the president should 
have a stronger reason for his threatened veto than its requirement 
that business provide notice to employees of plant closings and 
major layoffs 
it puts republicans on the side at least the perception out 
there of being against the poor working man and women who get four 
days notice dole told reporters a few minutes before the senate 
resumed debate 
the legislation produced by a housesenate conference committee 
has been under debate in the senate since friday the alaska 
dispute surfaced monday as a final critical stumbling block 
this legislation discriminates very violently against my 
state sen ted stevens ralaska declared sen frank 
murkowski ralaska also said he was incensed over oil provisions 
affecting his state 
it is currently illegal to export any oil from the alaska oil 
pipeline although the state does export some 4000 barrels a day 
from cook inlet 
the bill would limit export of oil from new refineries to 70000 
barrels a day and 50 percent of output thus far there is only one 
new refinery in alaska at the port of valdez 
the bill also would permit export to canada of 50000 barrels of 
crude a day but require first sending the oil aboard american 
vessels for a stopoff at a us port presumably seattle before it 
went back north of the border 
a similar provision was included in the uscanada free trade 
agreement signed by president reagan and prime minister brian 
mulroney earlier this year it was included in both the legislation 
and the agreement at the urging of politically influential maritime 
unions concerned about the impact on jobs 
the house passed the trade measure thursday by a vote of 
312107 more than enough to override the threatened presidential 
veto 
the 1000page bill would streamline the system under which the 
united states imposes import restrictions and takes other steps 
against international trade violations 
it also would overhaul the conditions under which such 
restrictions are imposed to protect us industries threatened by 
surges in imports 
in recent weeks however these provisions have been placed in 
the shadow by debate on a host of other provisions ranging from 
huge new agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits 
tax on oil companies

the supreme court raised the possibility today 
that states may deny unemployment benefits to workers fired for 
using the hallucinogenic drug peyote during religious ceremonies 
in a 53 ruling involving two men from oregon the justices 
stopped short of deciding whether there is a constitutional right 
to take peyote as a religious practice 
the court ordered the oregon courts to study the case further to 
determine whether religious users of peyote an illegal drug may 
have a right to unemployment benefits 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said 
because we are uncertain about the legality of the religous use 
of peyote in oregon it is not now appropriate for us to decide 
whether the practice is protected by the federal constitution 
he noted that the federal government and some states exempt the 
relgious use of peyote from criminal prosecution 
but stevens said criminal conduct possession of peyote in this 
instance is not automatically entitled to constitutional 
protection just because it is part of a religious ceremony 
the court set aside a ruling by the oregon supreme court that 
denial of unemployment compensation to the two men violated their 
right of religious freedom 
in a dissenting opinion justice william j brennan said the 
oregon supreme court already has decided the issue that todays 
opinion urged it to address 
accordingly i must assume that the us supreme court has 
tacitly left the oregon supreme court the option to dispose of 
these cases by simply reiterating its initial opinion and 
appending and we really mean it or words to that effect 
brennan said 
he was joined by justices thurgood marshall and harry a 
blackmun the three said they would vote to uphold the oregon 
supreme court decision 
the case involves galen w black and alfred l smith who were 
fired from the douglas county ore council on alcohol and drug 
abuse prevention and treatment adapt in 1983 and 1984 
respectively 
both men members of the native american church took small 
amounts of peyote as part of a church sacrament 
peyote a cactus button containing the hallucinogen 
mescaline is an illegal drug under oregon law there was evidence 
that the amounts taken by black and smith were too small to produce 
any hallucinatory effect 
black who worked for adapt as a drug rehabilitation counselor 
was himself recovering from drug and alcohol addiction when he used 
the peyote in september 1983 he had not used drugs or alcohol 
since 1982 
smith an alcoholic who had not used alcohol since 1957 worked 
for adapt counseling alcoholics from 1982 until his firing in the 
spring of 1984 
smith is a klamath indian black is not an indian there was no 
dispute that both were members of the native american church and 
sincerely believed that peyote is a part of the churchs religious 
practices 
after smith and black were fired for refusing to take treatment 
as relapsed addicts state officials refused to pay unemployment 
compensation to them 
smith and black said using small quantities of peyote in the 
native american church is comparable to sacramental use of small 
quantities of wine in christian religious ceremonies 
stevens said today that the illegality of an employees 
misconduct may be relevant to a claim that religious rights were 
violated 
for if a state has prohibited through its criminal laws 
certain kinds of religiously motivated conduct without violating 
the first amendment it certainly follows that it may impose the 
lesser burden of denying unemployment compensation benefits to 
persons who engage in that conduct he said 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia justice 
anthony m kennedy who joined the court in february after the 
justices heard arguments in the case did not take part in the 
decision 
the case is employment division vs smith 86946

cadbury schweppes plc said wednesday it would 
strongly resist any attempt by general cinema corp to try to 
acquire the british candy and soft drink manufacturer 
general cinema said in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission that it plans to increase its 177 percent stake in 
cadbury to more than 25 percent general cinema also said it 
intends to meet federal regulations in a possible purchase of more 
than half of the british companys stock 
cadbury which makes canada dry and motts soft drinks as well 
as mounds and almond joy candy bars said in a statement issued in 
london that its attitude toward general cinema remains 
unchanged 
cadbury has been critical of brookline massbased general 
cinema since it announced its initial stake in january 1987 
while cadbury said general cinemas sec filing was too 
ambiguous to be capable of clear interpretation cadbury added 
that any attempted involvement or interference from them in the 
management of the business would be unwelcome and strongly 
resisted 
general cinema described its initial stake in cadbury as only an 
investment but in its sec filing tuesday general cinema said it 
no longer can be considered a passive investor 
industry analysts estimate cadbury could fetch between 28 
billion and 35 billion 
general cinema holds a 60 percent stake in neimanmarcus group 
inc and is a 7up bottler as well as a cinema operator

a group of opec and independent 
oilproducing nations declared today they had begun cooperating to 
control oil prices but had reached no specific accords 
james audu spokesman for the cartel read a joint communique 
following a short meeting between six opec and seven nonopec 
countries that was designed to consider collaborative action to 
shore up prices 
the statement said the six opec members would present to the 
rest of the cartel on thursday a proposal by the independent 
producers to cut the countries oil exports by 5 percent for two 
months the statement said the meeting represented a new stage of 
cooperation 
there was no immediate indication that the pec group either 
endorsed or rejected the proposal which opec president rilwanu 
lukman of nigeria earlier had called a good beginning for 
cooperation between oil producers 
iran which was not involved in todays talks declared its 
support for the exportcutting plan but most other countries gave 
little indication of their views 
analysts said the proposal if implemented would push oil 
prices higher 
the proposal was put to an opec ministerial committee tuesday 
night by a group of seven independent oilproducing nations 
including mexico and china 
the plan calls for members of both groups to reduce oil exports 
by 5 percent for two months beginning may 1 it would mean 
reducing exports by a total of about 800000 barrels a day 
the idea is to take enough oil off the world market to force 
prices up to at least opecs target level of 18 a barrel 
opec oil currently is selling for between 14 and 16 a barrel 
and last month was slightly lower than that 
the six opec ministers meeting today were to hold another 
session later in the day with the seven outside producers all 13 
opec members then were to convene thursday to consider the 
exportcut plan 
paul mlotok an analyst for the investment firm salomon brothers 
inc and an observer of the vienna meetings said the plan if 
implemented would have a very positive effect on the oil 
market which has been weakened by excess supplies 
most the opec members represented in todays talks withheld 
immediate comment on the proposal which the cartel had solicited 
the seven nonopec countries involved in the talks are mexico 
china egypt angola oman malaysia and colombia 
delegation sources said later that opec and the independent 
producers already were squabbling over terms of the proposal 
colombia participating in the talks on the nonopec side 
indicated it would not join in the export reductions said the 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
opec officials also had asserted privately that some of the 
independent producers had inflated the figures for their current 
exports in order to minimize the impact on their actual sales 
these sources said 
hisham nazer the oil minister of saudi arabia declined to say 
whether his country supported the proposed cut in exports he told 
reporters however that wed like greater participation by 
independent producers in export reductions he did not mention any 
countries by name 
kazempour ardebili the deputy iranian oil minister said in an 
interview that his government favored the plan 
we accept the extent of the cut in exports he said adding 
that iran hoped additional nonopec countries including norway and 
the soviet union could be brought into the plan 
ardebili also criticized saudi arabias decision to break 
diplomatic relations with tehran 
he said the move was not likely to interfere with the opec 
deliberations in vienna although it may have been intended to 
have that effect 
he also asserted that the united states was behind the saudi 
decision announced tuesday 
this is a justification for more us military presence in 
the persian gulf in the future ardebili said 
members of the saudi delegation to the opec talks were not 
immediately available for comment 
the proposal to cut oil exports was presented to the opec 
committee by mexicos oil minister fernando hiriart he said 
afterward that for the nonopec group a 5 percent reduction would 
amount to cutting exports by 200000 barrels a day 
he declined to say what mexico or the other independent 
producers would do if opec did not agree to the exportreduction 
offer 
opec is sharply divided about whether it should reduce its oil 
production although it long has welcomed the prospect of 
collaborative efforts by independent oilproducers 
any joint action would mark the first such accord with outside 
oil producers in opecs 28year history 
kent hance a member of the texas railroad commission which 
regulates that states oil industry said tuesday that he saw a 
5050 chance the vienna meeting would produce an agreement to cut 
oil output 
hance was not involved in the group meetings but was holding 
private talks with individual opec and nonopec officials to 
underscore what he called his states desire to see stable oil 
prices

chrysler corps decision to continue auto 
production at its plant in kenosha wis at least through the end 
of the year will buy the area valuable time to create new jobs 
wisconsin officials said today 
its just outstanding news rep peter barca dkenosha 
said referring to the no 3 automakers announcement today that it 
will delay closing the 5500worker assembly plant in kenosha 
this gives us much more breathing room to bring new production 
to that plant said james klauser the top adviser to wisconsin 
gov tommy g thompson this is very important its positive 
its significant but it doesnt mean the problem has gone away 
the problem klauser said is finding new jobs for the 5500 
auto workers who will lose their jobs when chrysler halts auto 
production in kenosha 
the extension until the end of the year is certainly a step in 
the right direction sen joseph andrea dkenosha said i 
hope at the end of the year they look at another extension 
the time is needed he said to develop kenoshas industrial 
park complete new business and commercial developments expand the 
local airport and compete for a dog racing track 
klauser and barca agreed that negative reaction to chryslers 
announcement that it was moving some production of its kcars to 
mexico was responsible for the reprieve at kenosha 
i think chrysler is embarrassed by the publicity of moving 
jobs to mexico klauser said 
their announcement of moving production to mexico hit the 
public like cold water early in the morning barca said

event that 20000 to 40000 more kcars are needed before phaseout 
that production would take place in january in mexico 
as scheduled the newark plant will be converted to production 
of a kcar replacement by early fall chrysler said 
the announcement came after the uaw threatened to scrap early 
contract talks aimed at implementing an industrypattern contract 
established last fall at general motors corp and ford motor co 
the early talks also were designed to cool tempers over the 
kenosha closing and chryslers failed attempt to sell its 
28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary 
chrysler attributed the decisions on kenosha and kcar 
production to betterthanexpected sales of all cars in the first 
quarter and to success in marketing the dodge aries and plymouth 
reliant along with the omni horizon as america vehicles 
under the america program chrysler has cut prices and added 
standard equipment on aging vehicles to boost sales

sales sizzled iacocca said in a statement he said several of 
the companys cars and trucks had record sales in the first quarter

from december to the beginning of april while sales of the aries 
and reliant rose 153 percent since their inclusion in the america

active workers in 15 states and 65000 retirees kenosha pacts

the de beers diamond cartel said wednesday it was 
increasing prices for rough gemstones by an average of 135 percent 
as worldwide sales sparkle despite last falls stock market crash 
sales of diamonds which are priced in dollars have benefitted 
from the drop in the us currency which makes them cheaper to 
holders of japanese yen and european currencies 
de beers consolidated mines ltd a johannesburgbased concern 
which controls 80 percent of the worlds rough diamond market 
through its londonbased marketing arm central selling 
organization said the price increases for a broad range of uncut 
diamonds would take effect may 3 
when de beers last increased its prices by an average 10 
percent on oct 5 it boosted its prices for the betterquality 
diamonds the most 
but spokesman richard dickson said the latest increases are 
not weighted toward any particular category de beers does not 
disclose actual prices 
the october price increase was the only price increase in 1987 
and followed an increase of 145 percent in two stages in 1986 
the wholesale price of a polished onecarat dflawless diamond 
the highest grade was more than 17000 in april 
the cartel which sets prices for rough diamonds only operates 
a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in africa and australia to 
dealers and cutters in the worlds major diamond centers antwerp 
bombay new york and tel aviv 
the rough market is strong the prices of polished diamonds 
are strong retail demand is good dickson said much of the 
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from japan and 
southeast asia 
de beers reported record sales of 3075 billion in 1987 up 23 
percent from sales of 25 billion in 1986 
diamond sales which slumped in the early 1980s jumped even 
though de beers cut supply after the oct 19 stock market crash 
dickson said 
jewelry sales generally were strong at christmas he said 
the mood is optimistic and we would look forward to 1988 being 
a good year dickson said but he declined to provide a forecast 
de beers holds about 10 sales for international diamond dealers 
a year dickson said 
most of the worlds diamonds are industrial diamonds used 
primarily for drilling because they are so hard between 10 percent 
and 20 percent are gems

california investor burt sugarmans bid for 
media general inc suffered a setback today with a ruling that 
prevents a simple majority of votes from deciding the fate of his 
16 billion offer 
us district judge richard l williams ruled sugarmans 
6150ashare offer would have to be approved by twothirds of 
each class of shareholders who must vote separately 
like a number of media companies media general has two classes 
of stock to keep control of the company in the hands of a few 
shareholders while there are fewer class b shares outstanding 
those shares are more powerful than class a shares 
edward brodsky sugarmans attorney argued that media generals 
charter allows a simple majority decision by a combined vote of 
shareholders representing the companys two classes of stock 
brodsky said he would appeal the ruling 
but r harvey chappell jr media generals attorney said the 
special voting provision applied only to acquisions by the company 
and not to a concern trying to acquire it 
this is not an acquisition by media general chappell said 
this is an acquisition of media general 
the family of media general chairman d tennant bryan has 
opposed sugarmans offer the bryan family owns 71 percent of the 
companys more powerful 559168 class b shares 
williams ruling however did not end the case sugarman also 
has proposed three candidates including himself for election to 
the companys 10member board of directors an election will be 
held at the companys annual meeting next month 
those three seats are elected by class a shareholders sugarman 
controls 10 percent of media generals 28 million class a shares 
williams withheld rulings on other aspects of the takeover 
fight including sugarmans contention that only classa board 
members should be allowed to consider his offer pending the 
outcome of the proxy battle on the board seats 
media general is the parent company of richmond newspapers inc 
publisher of the richmond timesdispatch and the richmond news 
leader the company also holds other newspaper interests and owns 
several television stations

former penn square banker william pattersons 
desperate efforts to save his failing bank led him to enlist two 
cashstrapped accomplices in a scheme to defraud continental 
illinois bank prosecutors say 
charged along with patterson are john lytle a former 
continental illinois national bank amp trust co vice president who 
headed the chicago banks energylending division for oklahoma and 
tulsa drilling contractor jere sturgis 
a federal court jury resumed deliberations this morning after 
failing to reach a decision during more than two hours of 
deliberations tuesday 
the government contends that lytle caught in spiraling personal 
debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle accepted kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for funding and attempting to fund highrisk 
energy loans from continental for penn square customers between 
july 1981 and july 1982 
lytle had become so financially tied to bill patterson he 
couldnt move without him assistant us attorney joseph duffy 
said in closing arguments and as long as the continental doors 
were open to bill patterson the penn square doors were open to 
john lytle 
common sense duffy added facing the jurors should tell 
you that he lytle couldnt serve two masters 
lytle and patterson are charged with wire fraud and 
misapplication of funds sturgis with wire fraud 
the indictment cited lytles involvement in 44 million in loans 
made by continental to 12 penn square customers many without any 
documentation 
it did not say how much was recovered by the giant chicago bank 
which came to the brink of collapse in 1984 in part because of its 
troubled energy loans 
penn square bank of oklahoma city collapsed in july 1982 under 
the weight of energy loans it could not collect in 1984 
continental needed a 45 billion government bailout to survive one 
of the largest runs on deposits in banking history 
why didnt john lytle a 20year employee review these loans 
the way hed been trained the way his staff had recommended 
duffy asked 
its simple because bill patterson wanted these made 
because he needed them to keep his bank afloat 
prosecutors also charged that lytle and sturgis engaged in a 
related buyback investment scheme in which sturgis inflated 
the return on lytles investment in sturgis operations threefold 
to improve his chances of getting a continental loan through lytle 
patterson who was a vice president at penn square was the link 
between lytle and sturgis said duffy 
bill patterson is the central figure in this case and john 
lytle and jere sturgis are like planets revolving around the sun 
said duffy 
john lytle and jere sturgis were completely financially 
dependent on bill patterson and penn square 
penn square was the only bank willing to extend lytle and 
sturgis additional funds at the time duffy contended and lent 
sturgis 3 million which enabled him to buy out lytles 150000 
investment for 475000 
the buyback scheme was devised as a way for lytle to clear 
much of his personal debt and for sturgis who was then being 
pursued by creditors for more than 100 million in business loans 
to find a new lending source said duffy 
attorneys for lytle and patterson contended in their closing 
arguments monday that continental was saddled with troublesome oil 
and energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy not 
because of a fraud scheme

that its firstquarter earnings jumped 19 percent largely because 
of record beer sales 
for the first quarter of 1988 earnings were 1524 million or 
51 cents a share compared with earnings of 1281 million or 42 
cents a share for the first three months of 1987 
firstquarter sales rose 73 percent to 226 billion from 211 
billion in 1987 
growth in earnings per share benefitted from lower federal tax 
rates and from having fewer shares outstanding as a result of the 
companys share repurchase program the company said

produced and sold 192 million barrels of beer during the first 
quarter a 48 percent increase over the 183 million barrels sold

a year ago the company said those figures are based on industry 
sales estimates including imports

fort collins colo and began shipping beer in late march 
campbell taggart the companys diversified food subsidiary and 
the second largest contributor to corporate profit also increased

to benefit from cost control programs and international operations 
experienced favorable exchange rates and improved margins the 
company said 
in addition the companys entertainment subsidiary busch 
entertainment corp increased its profit contribution the growth 
was mainly related to increased attendance at busch gardens the 
companys theme park in tampa fla which is hosting a pair of

in japan where most company executives are 
employees who have climbed the ladder within their firms there are 
no highpaid executives like chrysler corp chairman lee a 
iacocca experts say 
there seems to be an understanding among workers that executives 
are paid reasonably although japanese bosses dont have to report 
their incomes publicly and often enjoy valued benefits not included 
in paychecks ranging from limousines to golf course memberships 
japanese top executives are not making huge sums of money like 
some of their american counterparts said an official of the 
federation of japan automobile workers union who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
ive never heard of pay for executives being used as a 
strategy for any labor negotiation it is also taken for granted 
that in case of a business slump executives voluntarily cut their 
pay by about 10 percent before resorting to such measures as laying 
off workers he said 
some us compensation experts say its difficult to compare 
payscales for executives in different countries one reason japans 
executives have lower pay than their american counterparts is the 
sharply higher japanese tax rate 
look at a country like england where executive compensation 
is quite low in cash buts that because they have a prohibitive 
tax structure so they give it in perks same in japan said 
charles peck a compensation specialist at the conference board a 
new yorkbased business research group studies in international 
compensation are just too difficult 
nevertheless pay levels for japanese executives became an issue 
in the united states during recent labor negotiations at chrysler 
corp the united auto workers criticizing the multimilliondollar 
pay received by top chrysler executives particularly iacocca said 
it would adopt japanesestyle production methods if chrysler 
executives accepted a japanesestyle pay system 
unlike the united states in japan the salaries of top 
executives are considered private even in publicly held companies 
private research companies estimate the figures 
estimates compiled by seikei kenkyujo a private research 
company put the average yearly pay for presidents of major vehicle 
manufacturers at about 2625 million yen 211700 and that of 
chairmen at 1830 million yen 147600 
for electrical firms an average president is paid the 
equivalent of 180500 while a chairman receives 169500 
the figures from seikei kenkyujo include cash compensation and 
bonus payments but not money earned through stock dividends or 
capital gains 
an average japanese automobile firm worker earns about 31000 
in salary and bonuses and electric firm workers about 29400 
statistics suggest that the average president of a japanese 
automobile or electrical firm earns about six or seven times more 
than his workers 
in another widely publicized difference from the united states 
japanese workers and executives seldom move to another company and 
high achievers move steadily up through the ranks 
in japan it is very rare for companies to bring someone from 
other companies and appoint him as a new president or chairman 
paying outrageous sums of money said hiroyuki kikuya of the wage 
and income research institute a private institute 
pay for a top japanese executive is set in accordance with the 
companys regular pay scale based on seniority he said 
kikuya also noted that in japan not much attention is paid to 
how much an individual contributes to a company unlike the norm in 
the united states where top executives are expected to make a 
stronger personal impact on their firms 
emphasis is always on the company as a whole and therefore it 
is natural that the companys success is not reflected in what 
executives earn kikuya said 
there might be some who are using company cars live in 
companyowned houses keep maids or buy golf club memberships with 
company expenses but even if these expenses are counted as their 
income i dont think they add up to much he said 
the national tax admimistration agency announces the names of 
the top 100 taxpayers each year the list contains many top company 
executives but does not say how much they earn or their taxable 
income

a group of 13 opec and independent 
oilproducing nations proclaimed a new stage of cooperation 
wednesday to stabilize world oil prices but failed to reach 
specific agreements 
six of the seven nonopec producers attending a widely watched 
meeting with cartel members offered to cut oil exports by 5 percent 
if opec did likewise the stated goal was to push up prices to 18 
a barrel and keep them there 
colombia was the lone holdout in the group of independent oil 
exporters 
the opec group neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal 
saying it would present it to a meeting of the full organization of 
petroleum exporting countries on thursday 
some analysts have said the plan if accepted by opec and 
implemented probably would push opec oil prices up quickly from 
their current level of 14 to 16 a barrel 
there was no immediate indication of how many opec members might 
accept the proposal asked by reporters if he liked it opec 
president rilwanu lukman of nigeria was noncommital saying its 
a good proposal in that its a proposal weve never had before 
earlier lukman had called the proposal a good beginning for 
cooperation between major oil producers 
iran which was not involved in wednesdays talks declared its 
support for the plan but officials from most other member 
countries withheld direct comment 
fernando hiriart the mexican oil minister and unofficial leader 
of the nonopec group told reporters after a short meeting with 
the six opec countries that he was very satisfied with the 
outcome 
the nonopec countries wont be participating in thursdays opec 
conference 
the vienna meeting marked the widest participation by 
independent oil producers in direct talks with opec in the 28year 
history of the cartel 
opec has said repeatedly in recent years that all oilproducing 
countries including the united states and soviet union must share 
the burden of controlling production if violent swings in oil 
prices are to be prevented 
in a joint statement the opec and nonopec countries in vienna 
said their meeting was an important first step 
it constitutes the beginning of a new stage of cooperation 
between a large number of oil producing countries the statement 
said the underlying assumption shared by all is that a stable oil 
market is the responsibility of all and consequently the burden 
should be shared 
the statement said the independent producers believed that oil 
production restraint was needed to bring prices back up to opecs 
target of 18 a barrel 
missing from the statement was any indication that the six opec 
countries who participated in the meeting wednesday favored further 
cuts in the cartels production as part of a pricestabilizing plan 
iran algeria and venezuela have said they want to negotiate 
cuts in opec production but others including saudi arabia 
nigeria and indonesia have been reluctant to commit themselves to 
this 
the saudiled faction fears that any production cuts by opec 
would only be offset by increases in output by other nations that 
are not cooperating with opec 
the seven nonopec countries involved in the talks were mexico 
china egypt angola oman malaysia and colombia 
brunei was invited but did not attend 
kazempour ardebili deputy iranian oil minister said in an 
interview that his government favored the plan presented by the 
nonopec countries 
we accept the extent of the cut in exports he said adding 
that iran hoped additional nonopec countries including norway and 
the soviet union could be brought into the plan 
ardebili also criticized saudi arabias decision to break 
diplomatic relations with tehran 
he said the move wasnt likely to interfere with the opec 
deliberations in vienna although it may have been intended to 
have that effect 
he also asserted that the united states was behind the saudi 
decision which was announced tuesday in order to justify a 
greater us military presence in the persian gulf where iranian 
and american forces have clashed 
the proposal to cut oil exports was presented to the opec 
committee by hiriart the mexican minister he said afterward that 
for the nonopec group a 5 percent reduction would amount to 
cutting exports by 200000 barrels a day 
a 5 percent cut in opecs oil exports would equal between 
700000 and 800000 barrels

a generation after opec learned the 
tricks of the oil trade from america a selfstyled envoy from the 
heart of us oil country has come to opec to see how the cartel 
works 
hes kent hance a handsome smoothtalking 45yearold former 
us congressman who currently is a member of the texas railroad 
commission which regulates that states large petroleum industry 
hances attendance as an observer to a special meeting of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries has received 
widespread attention and aroused us criticism that texas could 
become an accomplice to the cartels pricefixing strategies which 
often have been seen as harmful to american interests 
hance rejected the criticism as groundless 
were not in love with opec but we need to have input into 
decisions by an organization that control about 35 percent of the 
worlds oil supplies he said in an interview wednesday 
ensconced in his hotel room in central vienna hance patiently 
awaited word on a twicepostponed appointment to see rilwanu 
lukman the nigerian oil minister who doubles as opecs president 
vienna is the cartels headquarters 
hance said opec is a friendly group thats glad to have 
someone from the united states to have a dialogue with but he 
finds it hard to adapt to opec officials disregard for time 
schedules 
hed been told by lukmans aides that he could see the minister 
after an opec meeting that initially was set for 2 pm then 
rescheduled for 3 pm then 4 pm the session finally started 
about 5 pm 
he said he was still trying to adjust to what outsiders call 
opec time 
hance said he sees his mission as opening a dialogue with the 
cartel that the us government refuses to deal with 
i look at whats happened to our texas economy since oil 
prices crashed in 1986 he said no one else is going to be 
speaking up for the state of texas and someone had to do 
something 
a republican he ackowledged that im subject to criticism 
for talking with opec about ways to stabilize oil prices in 
defiance of the stated wishes of the reagan administration 
he said the two other members of the texas railroad commission 
are too cautious to undertake such a controversial venture 
i was the one who thought of this idea last fall he said 
if i think of something that might work ill take a risk 
hance met monday with fadhil alchabili the opec deputy 
secretary general who administers the cartels secretariat and 
other opec staff members 
he also held meetings with the oil ministers of venezuela and 
indonesia as well as officials of nonopec oilproducing countries 
such as norway 
hance said hes been impressed by the opec oil ministers 
knowledge of the business 
they have a good understanding of oil he said what they 
just cant understand is why a country that is the no 1 oil 
consumer and the no 2 producer doesnt have an energy policy 
hance said the us government should be in direct and regular 
contact with opec as part of a national energy policy 
if i were a farmer and i grew carrots and thats all i did 
and there was one entity one person in the world that set the 
price of carrots i would want to know that person and have some 
input he said 
opec will become increasingly important to the united states in 
the next decade hance said predicting that 65 percent of american 
oil supplies would be imported by 1992 up from 40 percent now 
we have to have some input rather than burying our heads 
in the sand and hope opec treats us okay he said how have 
they treated us without us input not very well 
he rejected suggestions that the united states should not deal 
with an organization whose marketrigging methods it dislikes 
we dont agree with the soviets theyre our enemies but we 
still have a dialogue with them

the government announced wednesday a major 
restructuring of air service after a twoweek strike and bankruptcy 
at its aeromexico airline 
the communications and transportation department said a 
commission would study possibly forming a new trunk airline to 
replace aeromexico especially for the 15 mexican cities now left 
without any major air service 
once the initial moment of this process is passed the 
commission will proceed to a review of the route system of 
national aviation and to an intense promotion of regional and local 
air transportation the department said 
among the regional privately owned airlines expected to benefit 
the most are aeromar in central mexico aerocalifornia in the 
northwest and aerocaribe in the southeast 
the business daily el financiero said the government and unions 
still could work out a plan to resume aeromexico service on its 
most viable routes to 10 or 14 mexican cities by as early as late 
this week 
rene arce spokesman for the national technical workers union 
that went out on strike april 12 said legal action will be taken 
to protest the decision 
in reality what they were looking for was to deal us a blow 
and they succeeded in doing just that he said 
the government said labor troubles a chronic financial deficit 
and deficient service had produced the problem at aeromexico it 
blamed the union for not accepting an earlier plan to restructure 
the airline by reducing the fleet and route system 
the airline filed for bankruptcy four days after the strike by 
the 7200 ground workers started saying it was losing more than 1 
million a day as a result 
meanwhile late tuesday the federal mediation board declared 
the twoweekold strike illegal and ordered employees to turn back 
all facilities to management 
the board said the striking union failed to comply with a 
statutory requirement that twothirds of union members in mexico 
city vote for the walkout 
a federal judge declared the airline bankrupt and ordered it 
into receivership on april 18 
aeromexico employed about 7200 ground workers as well as 1200 
cabin attendants and 800 pilots whose unions did not support the 
strike 
aeromexico started business in 1934 and has been owned by the 
government since 1957 it was operating 223 flights daily to 42 
domestic and internatioal destinations before the strike 
the governments other airline mexicana and a small state 
agency called federal air transport already have filled some of the 
vacuum caused by the lack of aeromexico service 
the statement said 14 million of the 17 million air passengers 
in mexico last year were carried by aeromexico or mexicana 
controlled by the government since 1982

grain and soybean futures closed mixed wednesday 
on the chicago board of trade with much of the selling due to 
profittaking after tuesdays sharp rise in soybean prices 
the rally tuesday had been fueled by rumors later denied by the 
agriculture department that the government plans to severely 
restrict planting of the soybean crop 
the selling pressure wednesday was offset by light commission 
house and fund buying said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
soybeans also got a boost from reports of rainy weather slowing 
the brazilian soybean harvest which is more than half complete 
it should take a few days for the fields to dry out there 
karlin said 
corn was nearly unchanged wheat retreated slightly on 
profittaking 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 1 cents lower with the 
contrat for delivery in may at 310 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to 1 cent higher with may at 200 a bushel oats were cent to 
1 cents higher with may at 167 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents

wendys international inc said wednesday it 
had a profit of 35 million in the first quarter in contrast to a 
loss of 68 million in the same period a year earlier 
the hamburger restaurant chain operator said the improvement 
reflected success in the companys efforts to build sales and cut 
costs 
the earnings for the quarter ended april 3 amounted to 4 cents 
per share 
firstquarter revenue slipped 12 percent to 2536 million from 
2566 million in the comparable period a year earlier 
robert l barney wendys chairman and chief executive said the 
revenue came from 60 fewer companyoperated restaurants than in 
1987 most of which were sold to franchise owners 
systemwide sales which include sales at restaurants operated by 
franchisees as well as those owned by the company rose 4 percent 
to 682 million from 6559 million in 1987 
average net sales for restaurants systemwide rose 73 percent to 
177000 in the quarter from 169000 a year earlier the company 
said the average at companyowned stores was up 6 percent to 
189000 from 179000 it said 
these results provide compelling evidence that the steps 
wendys took in 1987 to build sales and reduce costs are paying 
off barney said 
he said the results were more impressive because the first 
quarter is usually wendys slowest of the year 
among the features introduced last year is the superbar an 
allyoucaneat food buffet that offers salads mexican and italian 
food that is now available in about 1600 of the companys 3798 
restaurants 
james near president and chief operating officer said the 
superbars have helped build repeat business and attract new 
customers 
the superbar was added to 586 restaurants in the first quarter 
and near said virtually all of the 1100 companyowned restaurants 
in the united states should have the superbar by june while about 
half of the franchised restaurants in the us should have it by 
this fall 
he also cited the companys new advertising campaign for helping 
the company recapture momentum by drawing attention to its 
hamburgers 
the commercials offer a humorous parody of taste tests as a 
series of people choosing between a fresh wendys hamburger and a 
wilted offering from someone else select the competitors burger 
for all the wrong reasons

jury deliberations stretched into a second day 
wednesday in the federal trial of three men two of them former 
bank executives charged with scheming to defraud the continental 
illinois bank and trust co 
the sevenweek trial went to the jury late tuesday after 
instructions from presiding us district judge milton shadur 
at midday wednesday jurors sent a question to shadur who 
promptly talked with defendant william patterson his attorney 
burck bailey and government prosecutors during a brief telephone 
conference call 
assistant us attorney joseph duffy said the question was over 
d his leverage over the 
finances of his two cashstrapped codefendants in a scheme to save 
his own failing bank 
former continental vice president john lytle and tulsa okla 
oil contractor jere sturgis also are on trial 
the indictment cited lytles alleged links to 44 million in 
imprudent loans made by continental to 12 penn square 
customers many without any documentation it did not say how much 
was recovered by the chicago bank 
penn square bank collapsed in july 1982 under the weight of 
energy loans it could not collect in 1984 continental needed a 
45 billion government bailout to survive one of the largest runs 
on deposits in banking history 
the government contends that lytle was caught in spiraling 
personal debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle and accepted 
kickbacks from patterson the kicbacks were allegedly in exchange 
for funding and attempting to fund highrisk energy loans from 
continental for penn square customers between july 1981 and july 
1982 
prosecutors also charge that lytle and sturgis engaged in a 
related buyback investment scheme in which sturgis inflated 
the return on lytles investment in sturgis operations threefold 
to improve his chances of getting a continental loan through lytle 
the indictment alleges the buyback scheme was devised as a 
way for lytle to clear much of his personal debt and for sturgis 
who was then being pursued by creditors for over 100 million in 
business loans to find a new lending source in continental 
lytle and patterson are charged with wire fraud and 
misapplication of funds sturgis with wire fraud 
all three men have pleaded innocent

whle the relatively strong personal income numbers indicate the 
us economy remains healthy foreign exchange traders interpret 
the data as a signal that little progress will be made on the 
trade imbalance because we continue to consume foreign goods 
mcgroarty said 
meanwhile with little reason for the dollar to make a decisive 
move in either direction people are happy to be making moderate 
amounts of money trading in this small range deluna said

chrysler corps decision to delay closing 
its kenosha assembly plant will buy autoworkers and government 
officials time to cope with what officials say ultimately will 
amount to the biggest layoff in wisconsin history 
chrysler said wednesday it expects to close the 5500worker 
kenosha plant by the end of the year later than originally 
planned the automaker also said it will continue building its 
kcar in the united states during the cars phaseout 
its just outstanding news said state representative peter 
barca 
though state officials expressed hopes that the reprieve could 
be the first in a series for the aged plant chrysler chairman lee 
iacocca said the facilitys days still are numbered 
i do not want any more misunderstandings about kenosha it 
will only delay the closing it will keep a full work force on 
through years end and thats it iacocca said at a news 
conference 
he attributed the decision to keep the plant operating through 
the end of the year to favorable market conditions and pressure 
from wisconsin gov tommy g thompson and congressman les aspin 
dwis 
but ed steagall president of united auto workers local 72 
attributed the decision to uaw chief negotiator marc stepps 
insistence that chrysler not forget the kenosha workers 
he saw to it that kenosha was not just a bastard child but has 
been put in with the rest of the chrysler discussion steagall 
said 
others speculated the outcry over chryslers announcement last 
week that it would shift some auto production to mexico so that the 
kenosha plant could close on schedule also played a role in the 
decision 
what this demonstrates is that iacocca bends to public 
pressure and public ridicule state senate majority leader joseph 
strohl said the state and the workers should keep up the public 
pressure 
their announcement of moving production to mexico hit the 
public like cold water early in the morning barca said public 
relations has played a major part in all their decisionmaking over 
the last six months 
most officials are pragmatic about the delayed closing of the 
plant 
it allows the city of kenosha a little more breathing room and 
a chance for diversification said kenoshas mayor patrick moran 
the problem for the city will be finding new jobs for displaced 
auto workers in addition officials say kenosha needs time to 
develop its industrial park complete new business projects expand 
the local airport and compete for a dog track 
were still going to have a severe dislocation of a large 
number of workers state labor secretary john coughlin said 
combined the onetwo punch chrysler had planned to deliver to 
kenosha in july and september would have been the biggest layoff in 
state history he said 
delaying the layoffs will pump an additional 63 million in 
chrysler payroll checks into kenoshas economy an assistant to 
coughlin said 
the delay also will save the state 24 million in unemployment 
compensation costs and between 39 million and 96 million in 
welfare and social services costs according to official estimates

and specialty retailing company said wednesday its income fell 20 
percent in the first quarter partly due to uncertainty in the 
financial markets

business group posted a 15 percent increase in operating income 
during the period operating income from financial services 
excluding investment banking and securities brokerage dropped 12

usair group inc on wednesday reported a net 
loss of 188 million for the first quarter which the airline 
company blamed on rising costs at one of its subsidiaries and a 
decline in passenger traffic at another 
in dallas southwest airlines reported a dramatic turnaround 
based partly on the recovering texas economy and the sale of an 
unprofitable subsidiary 
usair group based in arlington va is the parent company of 
usair pacific southwest airlines piedmont aviation four commuter 
airline subsidiaries and a leasing and servicing subsidiary 
the 188 million loss compared with a net profit of 235 
million or 80 cents a share in the first quarter of 1987 
the loss occurred despite an increase in firstquarter revenue 
to 12 billion from 4649 million in the first three months of 
1987 
the company attributed the loss to an increase in the cost per 
available seat mile at usair mainly due to higher fuel prices and 
to declining traffic at pacific southwest 
the loss occurred during the januaryfebruary period and the 
companys profitability resumed in march said edwin colodny 
usair group chairman and president 
although the firstquarter results are disappointing colodny 
said the company is already seeing improvements at usair and will 
implement new schedule changes in may and june to improve service 
in pacific southwests former markets 
the new services include nonstop flights from pittsburgh and 
indianapolis to las vegas and between cleveland los angeles and 
san francisco beginning may 2 the carrier will also offer new 
nonstop service between pittsburgh and seattle starting in june 
all of the new westbound services will continue on to other west 
coast cities the first examples of link flying between the 
eastern and western portions of the companys route network 
colodny noted 
separately southwest airlines reported net earnings of 
168000 or 1 cent a share compared with a loss of 98 million 
in the first quarter of 1987 
the company reported operating revenue of 1785 million 
virtually unchanged from the 1783 million reported in the 
yearago quarter 
the carrier credited the improved earnings to a general 
strengthening of the texas economy and the sale of subsidiary 
transtar airlines which ceased operations in august transtar 
contributed to southwests loss in 1987 company officials said

nearly four years after bhopal chemical 
disaster union carbide corp chairman robert d kennedy said 
wednesday that the chemical giants business was good despite a 
multimilliondollar morass of litigation over the worlds worst 
industrial accident 
we would like to resolve the situation and get much needed aid 
to the victims but we cannot accept the courts attempt to impose 
legal liability without a trial especially as the evidence is now 
overwhelming that the tragedy was the result of a union carbide 
india employees deliberate act of sabotage kennedy said during 
the companys 70th annual meeting 
he also said the company is spending between 7 million and 8 
million annually on expenses from the bhopal litigation 
the leak of toxic gas on dec 31 1984 came from a pesticide 
plant run by the companys indian subsidiary the disaster killed 
more than 2800 people and and injured at least 20000 the indian 
government sued union carbide in september 1986 contending the 
leak was caused by negligence the company has said it resulted 
from sabotage by a disgruntled employee 
at the end of last year kennedy said the company offered an 
outofcourt settlement of 350 million which was rejected by the 
indian government 
on april 4 the high court in the central indian state of madhya 
pradesh ordered union carbide to pay 192 million in interim relief 
kennedy said wednesday the company has 60 days to respond and it 
has not decided yet whether it will appeal that order 
stockholders also approved a proposal to amend its policy that 
limits the liability of directors but one stockholder opposed the 
propoal saying it is very directly related to bhopal and 
added directors need to take personal responsibility for all 
actions of the company 
ward morehouse jr who said he represents some bhopal interest 
groups claimed that carbide moved heaven and earth to transfer 
the case to india and said he hopes the company now will not 
seek refuge in us courts 
another shareholder asked kennedy what the company means when it 
says it has accepted moral responsibility for the tragedy 
union carbide has accepted moral responsibility i dont know 
why we have to explain that kennedy said 
he said since the day after the accident the company has tried 
to do everything it could to resolve the issue but we have been 
literally bulldozed by the government of india and years later no 
court has heard testimony he said 
kennedy also said that the company is lean and healthy now he 
said debt is manageable and its goal is to bring the ratio of 
debt to capitalization below 60 percent within a few years he 
also said earnings for the full year may be closer to 3 per share 
rather than earlier expectations in the 240 range 
in other matters union carbide shareholders rejected a proposal 
to withdraw from whiteminority ruled south africa

chrysler corp said wednesday that 
its first quarter profit fell about 32 percent from a year ago due 
to a onetime charge for planned plant closings 
the nations third largest automaker netted 1837 million or 
83 cents a share on revenue of 78 billion in the first three 
months of 1988 that compared with earnings of 2694 million or 
124 and 601 billion in revenue last year 
without the plantclosings charge totaling 1502 million 
chrysler said it would have earned 2768 million or 125 a 
share in the first quarter 
chairman lee iacocca said the companys earnings also were 
affected by a decision to hold down prices to increase chryslers 
share of the us vehicle market 
we actually cut prices on 42 percent of the 1988 models we 
sell and weve held overall price increases to about 3 percent 
over the last three years iacocca said weve matched or 
bettered everybody on incentives 
iacocca said the strategy has resulted in a decision to increase 
production in 1988 it also has boosted chryslers share of the 
us car and truck market including sales of imported vehicles to 
145 percent in the first quarter from 135 percent a year ago with 
the companys highest quarterly sales in 15 years 
chrysler announced a second increase in planned 1988 production 
in a move that will delay until years end the closing of a 
5500worker former american motors corp plant and prevent at 
least temporarily transfer of kcar assembly work from detroit to 
toluca mexico 
iacocca said chrysler was increasing production by 110000 
vehicles in the second half of 1988 that represents a 126 percent 
boost to a total of 983000 vehicles 
earlier this year chrysler restored 56000 vehicles to 1988 
production schedules which had been trimmed in expectation of slow 
sales following the oct 19 stock market crash 
our customers seem to be happy they must like our products i 
guess they like our prices because theyre buying at a faster clip 
by far than we predicted just 60 days ago iacocca said 
chrysler had planned to move production of the omnihorizon from 
kenosha to detroits jefferson avenue plant in july shifting its 
kcar from detroit to mexico for 1989 phaseout production a plant 
in newark del which also builds kcars is being converted to 
produce a kcar replacement 
that announcement along with executive bonuses released last 
week brought tension to talks between chrysler and united auto 
workers union negotiators working on a national contract 
but wednesday iacocca said chrysler will build the omnihorizon 
at kenosha until january along with the plymouth gran fury dodge 
diplomat and chrysler fifth avenue in january chrysler will move 
the omnihorizon to detroit discontinue the other cars and shift 
kcar production to mexico if the cars are still selling well 
most of the increase in production will come from keeping the 
kenosha and detroit plants running at full capacity through 
january iacocca said 
during the first quarter chrysler said its share of the us 
truck market rose to 191 percent from 175 percent a year ago due 
partly to increased jeep production following chryslers august 
1987 purchase of amc 
chrysler said its share of the us car market also rose 
slightly in the first quarter from a year ago 
in march chrysler backed down from the attempted sale of its 
28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary but said it would close 
four acustar plants if it couldnt sell them within 18 months the 
four plants three in detroit and one in van wert ohio together 
employ about 2000 workers 
chrysler previously had announced plans to close acustar plants 
in indianapolis and sarnia ontario 
in the first quarter general motors corp said its earnings 
rose 18 percent to 109 billion or 311 a share on sales of 
2644 billion from 9225 million or 262 a share on sales of 
261 billion a year ago 
however gms firstquarter earnings would have fallen 6 percent 
without a onetime accounting change that added 2242 million or 
70 cents a share 
ford motor co the most profitable automaker in 1986 and 1987 
is scheduled to report first quarter earnings thursday

futures prices for gold silver and platinum posted solid gains 
wednesday on expectations that opec members would agree on a plan 
to reduce exports of crude oil analysts said 
on other markets energy futures retreated livestock and meat 
futures rose sharply grains and soybeans were mixed and 
stockindex futures fell 
analysts said the metals markets were primed for a technical 
rally and reports that seven independent oilproducing countries 
had offered to cut their oil exports if opec would do the same 
provided an impetus for the surge 
the oilrich countries hope a drop in exports will reduce world 
supplies enough to force oil prices higher because higher oil 
prices would be viewed as inflationary investment demand for 
precious metals also could increase 
the nonopec nations made their offer of a 5 percent cut in 
exports contingent on the 13 members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries agreeing to a reduce their exports by 
the same amount 
opec ministers were to meet thursday in vienna to discuss the 
offer reports of disagreement among opec members especially 
between saudi arabia and iran caused oil futures to drop sharply 
late in the day but the metals ignored that completely said 
bette raptopoulos metals analyst for prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
the metals are anticipating that the opec talks will continue 
in a positive vein tomorrow she said 
technical data suggested the metals rally would continue said 
richard levine vice president of the precious metals and foreign 
exchange group at elders futures inc in new york 
silver futures made an especially sharp move upward because 
levine said the recent lack of volatility in the silver market had 
made it overdue for a strong move in either direction 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold settled 250 to 3 
higher with the contract for delivery in june at 45430 a troy 
ounce silver was 115 cents to 119 cents higher with may at 650 
a troy ounce platinum gained 650 across the board on the new 
york mercantile exchange with july settling at 52620 a troy 
ounce 
skepticism about an oilexport cut sparked a heavy round of late 
selling in the energy futures pits at the new york mercantile 
exchange 
i think a lot of people are anticipating theres a chance that 
opec will not agree to cut back on production said andrew lebow 
energy analyst with edamp f man international futures inc 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 33 cents 
lower with june at 1827 a barrel heating oil was 27 cent to 49 
cent lower with may at 5177 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
06 cent to 1 cent lower with may at 5236 cents a gallon 
higher cash prices linked to stronger demand supported livestock 
futures on the chicago mercantile exchange said philip stanley an 
analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in chicago 
frozen pork bellies advanced on technical strength and 
expectations for a seasonal increase in demand he said 
live cattle settled 10 cent to 117 cents higher with june at 
7157 cents a pound feeder cattle were 52 cent to 90 cent higher 
with april at 8075 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent to 65 cent 
higher with june at 4935 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
47 cent to 115 cents higher with may at 5267 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures settled mixed on the chicago board of 
trade with much of the selling due to profittaking after tuesdays 
sharp rise in soybean prices 
soybeans finished mixed to lower following the agriculture 
departments denial of reports it had predicted unexpectedly large 
reductions in crop acreage under a government pricesupport program 
but the selling pressure was offset by light commission house 
and fund buying said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
soybeans also got a boost from reports of rainy weather slowing 
the brazilian soybean harvest which is more than half complete 
corn was fractionally higher wheat retreated slightly on 
profittaking 
wheat settled unchanged to 1 cents lower with may at 310 a 
bushel corn was cent to cent higher with may at 201 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with may at 167 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 3 cents higher with may at 
675 a bushel 
stockindex futures retreated on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for june delivery of the standard amp

moderate version still had a chance of passage later this year if 
president reagans veto is sustained 
reagan who has vowed repeatedly to veto the bill unless his 
objections were met was asked what he planned to do with the 
measure as he greeted canadian prime minister brian mulroney for a 
state dinner at the white house 
just what i promised he replied 
some of the bills major provisions would require the 
administration to retaliate against unfair trading practices by 
other nations and streamline procedures for imposing curbs on 
imports 
sponsors said the bills main downfall was a plan to require 
employers to give notice of plant closings and major layoffs 
danforth said trying to carry the bill in the senate with that 
feature was like swimming the english channel and you get about a 
mile out and someone hands you a 500pound barbell and says here 
carry this 
democratic leaders also were unable to unsnarl a dispute over 
the bills curbs on alaskan oil exports and thus failed in an 
effort to win over that states disgruntled republican senators in 
the end 11 republicans defied the white house and voted for the 
measure 
one democrat voted against the bill retiring sen william 
proxmire of wisconsin who said he was concerned over the bills 
easing of the foreign corrupt practices act 
the white house itself brought heavy lobbying pressure to head 
off any recurrence of last weeks defeat in the house where the 
measure passed by more than a vetoproof margin most wavering 
republicans ended up opposing the bill 
deputy white house press secretary bj cooper said that based 
on todays vote the numbers are there to sustain a veto but 
added we will continue working with both houses to make sure 
that when the veto goes up that it is sustained 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter said i am 
encouraged by todays senate vote and optimistic that the 
presidents veto of the omnibus trade bill will be sustained but 
he added that it would be tragic if lawmakers did not try for a 
more moderate version 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas told 
reporters he would work to override the presidents veto but he 
said it was obvious that the odds are against us 
he said any new version of the bill would have to be very much 
like the current one but with the plantclosings provision and 
perhaps the alaskan oil export curbs removed 
one wavering republican who supported the bill the first time 
around sen david karnes rneb went to the white house and met 
for 30 minutes with president reagan vice president bush chief of 
staff howard baker treasury secretary james a baker iii and 
energy secretary donald hodel 
he emerged from the session expressing concern over dutyfree 
imports of ethanol from the caribbean and saying what i needed 
was the presidents assurance that the administration was going to 
introduce another bipartisan bill that could be quickly passed by 
the congress and signed 
and i think he has done that karnes said 
before the vote sen donald w riegle jr dmich urged his 
colleagues to turn a deaf ear to the japanese trade minister 
whining and complaining about the 1000page measure produced by 
a housesenate conference committee 
he has no justification to say one word about because they 
have been cheating from a to z in international trading with us for 
years riegle said 
reagan renewed his veto threat and promised to work later for a 
milder version in a letter tuesday to senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan 
reagan called on lawmakers to finish the trade bill process in 
a way that serves americas interests not the special interests 
most administration fire has been directed at a provision that 
would require all but the smallest companies to provide their 
employees with 60day notice of plant closings and largescale 
layoffs 
sen edward m kennedy dmass defended the embattled 
plantclosings provision saying 40000 plants have shut down in 
this decade of increased foreign competition 
nearly 2 million people have lost their jobs each year 
kennedy said yet the administration does not want workers to 
know their jobs are in danger and to have time to plan for new ways 
to provide for their families 
the administration dangled the prospect of a slimmed down 
version of the bill minus the plantclosings and perhaps other 
provisions once congress has sustained reagans expected veto of 
the current measure 
but democratic leaders said this could be the last chance to 
support trade legislation before the fall election campaign 
the house passed the bill last thursday 312107 more than 
enough to override a veto 
the bill would overhaul the system under which the united states 
imposes import curbs and takes other steps to retaliate against 
international trade violations and other unfair practices 
authority to retaliate would be transferred from the president 
to the us trade representative retaliation would be mandatory 
but the bill provides five broadly phrased exceptions such as 
threats to national security 
main provisions also streamline the means by which the united 
states imposes import restrictions to protect american businesses 
threatened by surges in import competition 
but the 1000page measure contains hundreds of additional 
provisions ranging from billions of dollars in agricultural 
subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies 
government aid to workers left jobless by import competition 
would be expanded trade sanctions would be imposed on japans 
toshiba corp one of its subsidiaries and the norwegian company of 
kongsberg vapenfabrikk for sale of submarine silencing equipment to 
the soviet union 
the measure would assist americans in defending themselves 
against bribery charges brought under the foreign corrupt practices 
act because of payments made by their agents overseas it would 
ease some export curbs on hightech equipment subject to 
restriction because of its potential military uses 
a maze of minor provisions governs trade in everything from 
cranberries to cantaloupes 
several republicans have expressed irritation at the 
administrations heavy focus on the plantclosings provision as the 
reason to oppose the bill 
it puts republicans on the side at least the perception out 
there of being against the poor working man and women who get only 
fourday notice dole said

a federal judge on wednesday approved with 
several modifications proposed consent decrees to regulate 
allterrain vehicles blamed for nearly 1000 deaths and 300000 
injuries in the last five years 
the settlement between the consumer product safety commission 
and five manufacturers has been criticized by consumer groups and 
lawmakers as not providing adequate protection or compensation for 
owners of the vehicles known as atvs 
but us district judge gerhard a gesell said no decree 
designed to protect consumers has ever gone this far in meeting 
such a massive national consumer problem 
the settlement was approved after the judge persuaded attorneys 
for the cpsc and the manufacturers to agree to several changes in 
the order that satisfy objections he made at an april 18 hearing 
the revised consent decree eliminates a provision that allowed 
the cpsc to initiate a general recall only if it found new and 
substantial evidence that the vehicles were hazardous 
it also bars the cpsc from initiating a socalled generic recall 
of atvs before dec 31 1990 the original decree empowered the 
agency to take such action a year after the agreement received 
court approval 
cpsc general counsel james v lacy said the change clarifies 
the evidentiary standard but provides a longer period of time to 
allow the agreement to work 
the elimination of the substantial evidence wording was 
hailed by katherine meyer an attorney who represented a variety of 
consumer and health groups including the american academy of 
pediatrics and the american public health association 
under the decree as it was previously written the cpsc could 
not do anything further unless it came up with new and substantial 
evidence of safety hazards meyer said such a standard 
excluded a failure to reduce deaths and injuries 
it was a major problem we had with the decree she said 
the consent decrees between the commission and the five 
manufacturers bans the sale of threewheel atvs unless the 
manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by 
the cpsc 
it also requires warning labels on fourwheel models 
distributors must prvide training in the safe use of all types of 
atvs to owners who purchased the vehicles after dec 30 1986 
it also requires the manufacturers to spend 85 million to warn 
consumers about the hazards of atvs and promote the training 
there are an estimated 24 million atvs in use in this country 
including 15 million threewheel models 
cpsc chairman terrence m scanlon said in a statement that he 
was personally gratified that the federal district court agreed 
that the commissions allterrain vehicle settlement is in the 
public interest 
had the consent decree not been signed years of protracted 
and uncertain litigation would have followed he said 
with nearly 1000 atvrelated deaths and more than 300000 
hospital emergency room injuries already recorded many to 
children under 16 such a delay would have come at an unacceptably 
high cost he said 
critics including members of congress and the attorneys general 
of 32 states contended the agreement was flawed because it didnt 
require the manufacturers to give owners a refund for atvs they 
decided they no longer wanted 
the settlement is only a beginning because it fails to include 
any real remedy for the million and a half people who are stuck 
with especially hazardous threewheel atvs rep james florio 
dnj said in a statement 
florio is sponsoring legislation that would require 
manufacturers to make refunds 
ms meyer said that although the groups she represents are 
pleased about the decree they will continue to lobby congress to 
enact a refund bill 
another modification requires the distributors to require 
dealers in new or renewed franchise contracts to warn customers of 
the hazards specifically to children of atvs and to ensure the 
vehicles bear the required safety labels 
the original decree had required the manufacturers to make their 
best efforts to get the dealers to implement these requirements 
other changes include a requirement that cpsc maintain a central 
repository of consumer complaints and other reports to enable the 
public and the agency to determine how the consent decree is 
working 
the agencys general counsel is also required to make a public 
filing to explain why he has granted any extensions in compliance 
deadlines that are longer than six weeks 
one consent decree is with four japanese firms and their 
american divisions honda motor co ltd yamaha motor co ltd 
susuki motors co ltd and kawasaki heavy industries ltd the other 
decree is with polaris industries a usbased manufacturer

americans personal incomes boosted by 
profitsharing payments in the auto industry posted the biggest 
gain last month since december while consumer spending jumped a 
healthy 07 percent the government reported wednesday 
the commerce department said personal incomes climbed 08 
percent in march after a 06 percent gain in february it was the 
best increase since an identical 08 percent advance in december 
analysts said spending and income figures showed that the 
consumer who cut back on purchases immediately following the 
october stock market crash had rebounded and was continuing to 
propel overall economic growth 
the report had little impact in the financial markets however 
as stock prices rose slightly bond prices slipped and the dollar 
edged lower 
but oil prices ended lower after trading erratically on 
speculation about the outcome of a meeting between opec and 
independent oil exporters on the new york mercantile exchange the 
junedelivery contract for west texas intermediate crude fell 33 
cents a barrel to 1827 
in reporting tuesday on the gross national product the 
government said the consumer was the biggest source of strength 
during the first three months of the year consumer spending rose 
at an annual rate of 38 percent after adjusting for inflation 
during the quarter 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity had declined by 25 percent in the final three 
months of 1987 raising fears that if americans stopped spending 
especially for bigticket items the nation could be pushed into a 
recession 
there is no serious consumer retrenchment going on people are 
still willing to buy said sandra shaber an economist with the 
futures group an economic forecasting firm in washington we 
shouldnt face any serious problem of a spending slump for the rest 
of the year 
ms shaber predicted that consumer spending would rise at a 
modest 2 percent annual rate for the entire year about the same as 
in 1987 
the 08 percent march increase in incomes would have been a much 
smaller 02 percent if special factors including an annual bonus 
for auto workers had been excluded 
the average 2500 payment to 108000 ford motor co employees 
accounted for more than half of the increase in wages and salaries 
last month which rose 05 percent in march the government said 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington 
mass said that with unemployment now at a nineyear low of 56 
percent the modest increase in wages for the month was good news 
he said it showed the economy is not beginning to see inflationary 
pressures from rising wage demands 
wages are rising at an annual rate of about 25 percent to 3 
percent which is still low by historical standards wyss said 
in all personal incomes rose 296 billion to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 392 trillion personal consumption 
spending which includes virtually everything except interest 
payments on debt rose 218 billion to an annual rate of 309 
trillion 
disposable or aftertax incomes were up as well climbing 06 
percent in march following a 08 percent february increase 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income dipped slightly last month to 45 percent from 47 percent 
in february although both months showed an improvement from the 
37 percent average savings rate in 1987 
the spending advance came in the categories of nondurable goods 
and services durable goods items such as cars that are expected 
to last at least three years edged down 300 million during march 
after a huge 92 billion rise in february 
but purchases of nondurable goods were up 98 billion while 
purchases of services which include housing costs rose 122 
billion

a security sweep has revealed a 
stateoftheart wiretap on the office telephone used by the 
head of the eastern airlines pilots union the union said wednesday 
it was the third such discovery in 1 years said ron cole a 
spokesman for the air line pilots association who refused to 
speculate on the origin of the bug 
at this point in time i think it would be premature for us to 
make any accusations cole told the associated press in a 
telephone interview 
cole would not identify the security firm that found the 
wiretap described as an electronic board about 2 inches long and 
by 1 inch wide 
coral gables police sgt m ginn said wednesday that his 
department received a complaint about a wiretap at alpa 
headquarters earlier this week 
fbi agent al lamanna in miami said his office had not received 
any report of the alpa wiretap 
duty officers at the tallahassee and the miami offices of the 
florida department of law enforcement said they didnt know if 
their agency was involved in the investigation 
these are troubled times at our airline cole said in a news 
release industrial espionage such as this only serves to 
heighten the stress 
facing a possible strike by its machinists union the largest of 
the three unions at miamibased eastern management at the 
financiallytroubled carrier held secret contract talks with alpa 
that broke off earlier this month 
eastern and its owner texas air corp are under government 
scrutiny over safety and management practices earlier this month 
eastern was fined 823500 for safety infractions and the federal 
aviation administration undertook planebyplane inspections of 
eastern and of continental airlines another texas air subsidiary 
the latest bug was found attached to the main rotary line at the 
coral gables headquarters of alpa last week during a routine 
periodic electronic security check the union stated it was found 
on the line most frequently used by jack bavis chairman of the 
alpa local cole said 
the sophisticated parasitic transmitter device had the 
capability to be accessed with a radio receiver up to several 
hundred feet away from the building the release said 
the bug was left in place until tuesday so the telephone company 
could check it out cole said security experts could not determine 
how long it had been there he added 
bugs were discovered in november 1986 in a phone in the 
chairmans office and on two other phones the release stated 
two months ago a security sweep also found a listening device 
attached to the table used by the pilots group chairman at a hotel 
meeting of the pilots union leadership at that meeting labor 
officials were discussing possible buyout plans of eastern by 
employee groups 
cole said investigations of those buggings were continuing
