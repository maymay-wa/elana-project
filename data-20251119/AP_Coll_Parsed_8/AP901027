consumer confidence in the economy plunged in 
october to the lowest level since 198182 recession a prominent 
business research group reported friday 
the conference boards widely followed monthly index of consumer 
confidence tumbled more then 24 points the biggest onemonth drop 
in the 20year history of the survey 
we had a tremendous drop in confidence said fabian linden 
executive director of the conference boards consumer research 
center it was all pretty dreary 
the index is based on a poll of 5000 households nationwide 
conducted by national family opinion inc of toledo ohio the poll 
asks questions about spending on cars appliances and homes job 
security and general economic conditions it is scrutinized by 
economists because consumer spending is a crucial element in 
economic growth 
the index dropped sharply in august and did not rebound in 
september which conference board analysts attributed to anxiety 
over the persian gulf crisis but there was nothing in the economic 
news to explain the septembertooctober drop 
linden said the conference board had concluded that many 
consumers were appalled by the inability of congress and the bush 
administration to agree quickly on a budget package 
an important factor in the decline was the great budget 
comedy linden said it was a pretty disenchanting 
experience 
the conference board based in new york is a businessfunded 
economic research organization

a japanese wrestler who once fought 
muhammad ali a french daredevil pilot and an american vietnam 
veteran are among the wouldbe peacemakers who have converged on 
baghdad since iraqs invasion of kuwait 
i am here to try to stop a war said antonio inoki 47 of 
tokyo 
inoki a professional wrestler lasted 15 rounds and took a draw 
in an exhibition freestyle fight with heavyweight boxing champion 
mohammad ali 16 years ago 
many americans do not want war and this is exactly what we 
are telling the iraqi people and the government said rick droz 
of pasadena calif who said he lost his leg as a us marine 
during the vietnam war 
the peacemakers descend on baghdad almost daily 
western diplomats have said they are being manipulated by 
president saddam husseins government whose ventures into 
international public relations in the past have backfired 
shortly after iraq invaded its oilrich neighbor on aug 2 
saddam was shown on iraqi television with detained westerners whom 
he has called guests saddams pat on the head of one western 
child brought world outcry 
his speeches to the west broadcast worldwide have often been 
rambling selfjustifications couched in religious terms 
his latest tactic appears to be welcoming foreign peace groups 
lodged free of charge at fivestar hotels and met by huge 
welcome banners 
none of them talk of who started it all a western diplomat 
said on condition of anonymity it is like i insult you i slap 
you i rob you and then a neighbor comes and says peace peace 
but most of the visitors speak earnestly of their desire to help 
avert war 
they claim they are free to move around baghdad but almost none 
speaks arabic so they need interpreters in iraq an interpreter is 
often a secret service agent or a government official 
wellknown public figures who have come to intercede on behalf 
of western hostages include american civil rights activist jesse 
jackson austrian president kurt waldheim and former british prime 
minister edward heath 
all succeeded in winning the freedom of limited numbers of their 
countrymen waldheim took home 95 austrians heath was allowed to 
take 33 britons jackson got out 55 americans and a few days ago 
an iraqiamerican group took with it 14 us citizens 
but thousands of westerners are still detained in iraq and 
kuwait and about 600 are being used as human shields at strategic 
installations to deter possible attack by usled multinational 
forces in the persian gulf 
saddams government appears thrilled by the peace groups and 
occasional celebrities who drop in 
we want peace as well one iraqi official said on condition 
of anonymity 
the visits are wellpublicized by iraqs state broadcast and 
print media 
i am here to represent the attitudes of 75 percent of the 
french people all of whom know about war its miseries and 
disasters the englishlanguage baghdad observer quoted french 
daredevil pilot albert maltret as saying 
maltret whose professional name is baron noir or the black 
baron made headlines in 1988 when he buzzed paris aboard an 
ultralight plane 
he took with him to baghdad his 16yearold daughter and 
13yearold son 
the iraqi news agency ran a 400word profile of maltret calling 
him a french national hero who says he is ready to fight and 
die for the values and principles of the peaceloving people of 
iraq and their leader 
a 20member american group named the fellowship of 
reconciliation brought childrens paintings with peaceloving 
themes 
these are all done by our kids back home and you can make out 
how much they think of peace said evelyn mattern who identified 
herself as a roman catholic nun from raleigh nc 
jim lewis a clergyman from raleigh walks around baghdad in a 
long white robe a cross hanging from one shoulder give peace a 
chance please he said in an interview 
one asian diplomat was less critical of the peace groups than 
his western counterparts 
you never know which of the peace groups may succeed in 
stopping a war he said on condition of anonymity

iraqi occupation forces in kuwait wired all 
four of the persian gulf emirates oil refineries with plastic 
explosives and carted off large chunks of kuwaits oil industry 
equipment us government sources say 
the explosives if detonated could knock out kuwaits entire 
refining capacity the sources said friday 
explosives also have been placed at other vital oil 
installations including pipeline pumping stations oil processing 
centers oil wells and loading terminals said the sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said the moves appear to be part of a scorched earth 
strategy by iraqi president saddam hussein to devastate kuwaits 
economic base in the event his army is forced to withdraw by the 
usled multinational forces in the region 
theyre basically all wired up for destruction even the 
refineries said one source who is involved in the 
administrations monitoring of developments inside kuwait 
iraq also is removing large quantities of chemicals pipes 
meters and other oilprocessing and production materials from 
storage areas in kuwait for apparent use in iraq the sources said 
there is no evidence however that the iraqis are dismantling oil 
refineries by removing operational parts they added 
representatives of the exiled kuwaiti government have said their 
countrys oil industry was being severely damaged by iraqi forces 
but few details had come to light 
the threat of war against iraq to force saddams army out of 
kuwait has been a central reason for the rapid escalation of crude 
oil and gasoline prices over the past 10 weeks oil market 
participants fear that war would knock out many oil production 
facilities in kuwait iraq and possibly saudi arabia creating a 
global shortage 
an administration source said us spy satellites had provided 
photographic evidence of iraqi forces moving kuwaiti oil industry 
equipment and materials across the border into iraq 
its a wholesale cannibalizing said one american oil 
industry source 
by capturing kuwait in an aug 2 invasion iraq gained control 
of one of the middle easts most advanced oil production and 
refining industries kuwaits four modern refineries mina 
abdullah mina ahmadi and shuaiba near kuwait city and the much 
smaller mina saud facility near the southern border with saudi 
arabia had a preinvasion capacity of nearly 900000 barrels a 
day 
the explosives attached to these facilities could if detonated 
knock out all of kuwaits refining capability for at least six 
months the sources estimated it would take at least two years to 
get the facilities back to full capacity they said 
details about the installation of plastic explosives at 
refineries and other kuwaiti oil facilities have come from kuwaiti 
exiles and from released foreign hostages an administration source 
said

mayor marion barry says he plans to proceed 
with his campaign for a city council seat even though he faces a 
sixmonth jail term for cocaine possession 
for the next few months i will manage the district of 
columbia government and also continue my campaign for city 
council barry in a brief meeting with reporters after fridays 
sentencing asked whether he should continue his bid for a citywide 
council 
seat barry responded absolutely why not 
he attributed the jail term to the inequities of the american 
injustice system 
barry is locked in a close battle for second place in an 
eightway contest for a council job the top two votegetters will 
win council posts and recent polls show that democratic nominee 
linda cropp has a sizable lead 
the final seat is expected to be won either by barry or 
incumbent hilda mason of the districts statehood party 
barry dropped his democratic party affiliation and registered as 
an independent to run for the seat less than two weeks after being 
convicted of the misdemeanor possession charge he had ruled out 
running for a fourth term as mayor in advance of his drug trial 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson could have merely 
sentenced barry to probation as a first offender but he said the 
mayors breach of public trust alone warrants an enhanced 
sentence 
the judge stayed the sentence which also includes a 5000 
fine pending resolution of an appeal filed by defense attorney r 
kenneth mundy 
jackson also placed barry on one year of probation and ordered 
him to submit to random drug tests during that period and he 
ordered barry to pay for the cost of his incarceration which would 
come to 5167 if as is likely he is sent to a minimumsecurity 
facility according to bureau of prison figures 
barrys drug use contributed to the anguish that illegal drugs 
have inflicted on this city in so many ways for so long jackson 
said 
having failed as the good example he might have been to the 
citizens of washington dc and in particular to the young who 
are much more likely to respond to example than to admonition the 
defendant must now become an example of another kind the judge 
said 
after the sentencing barry said i should have been shocked 
and stunned but im not i understand that there are different 
sets of standards for different people and thats the american 
injustice system 
mundy who argued during the trial that barry had been singled 
out for prosecution because he is a wellknown black official said 
the judge had made the mayor a whipping boy for all the ills that 
beset the district of columbia

immigrants from the soviet union officials said after a temporary 
halt that jewish groups harshly criticized 
faced with record numbers of newcomers the government stopped

applications had been filed in kiev alone 
interior ministry spokesman willi hausmann said in an interview 
friday that the government will talk with jewish groups in germany 
and abroad about how to resume the immigration 
german officials had expressed fears that rising antisemitism 
in the soviet union may force many of the estimated 2 million 
soviet jews to seek new lives in germany 
germanys social services and housing have been strained to the 
limit by the arrival of about 200000 asylumseekers from the third 
world and eastern europe this year in addition to about 500000 
east germans 
fewer than 40000 jews currently live in germany compared to

the senate early saturday completed 
congressional action on a bill to prevent the district of columbia 
from using its own tax dollars on abortions for poor women unless 
necessary to save the life of the mother 
the senate approved the measure by voice vote several hours 
after it cleared the house also by voice 
it is a compromise that is necessary at this time said rep 
julian dixon dcalif chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on the district of columbia it is one that i 
certainly am not happy with 
the restriction was included in the districts spending bill for 
the fiscal year that began oct 1 a similar provision was in last 
years bill 
the measure includes an appropriation of 548 million for city 
operations of which 430 million is known as the federal payment 
paid the city in lieu of taxes on federal property the bill also 
approves the spending of 39 billion from the districts own 
treasury 
the abortion restrictions were put in the bill by a housesenate 
conference committee after the house rejected the bill twice in the 
last week y because it allowed the district to spend its own money 
on the procedure 
dixon said that when conferees went back to work on the bill 
after the rejections they reduced it by 2 million to please some 
members of the house who also felt the federal government was 
giving the city too much money 
he said the money came out of appropriations for the citys 
schools and administrative services 
the original house and senate bills prohibited the use of 
federal funds for abortion except to save the mothers life and in 
cases of rape and incest but were silent on the use of local 
funds 
president bush had said he would veto the legislation if it 
contained funds for abortion he made the same threat last year and 
was succesful in forcing retention of a ban on use of local funds 
in last years appropriations bill 
it is the 11th hour said dixon there is no alternative 
for the first time the house is now mandating to the residents of 
the district of columbia how they spend their own money 
what this does is get it down to the white house dixon said 
of the abortion restrictions it lets the district of columbia 
get their federal payment and get on with business i hope next 
year this house and the president of the united states will change 
their attitude

president bush and his top advisers will 
decide next week whether to expand the mission of secretary of 
state james a baker iii to saudi arabia to include other arab 
countries us officials say 
egypt is almost certain to be added to the itinerary as baker 
seeks to bolster the arab coalition against iraq 
his stop in saudi arabia was announced friday by white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater at the same time fitzwater said it was 
not true that baker would ask leaders of the oilrich monarchy 
to approve military action against iraq to force its withdrawal 
from kuwait 
later speaking to reporters aboard air force one bound for 
hawaii fitzwater said baker and the saudis would discuss the 
implementation of un sanctions the status of us and 
multinational forces in the gulf general defense needs arab unity 
and military options 
fitzwater announced the trip in los angeles where bush was 
making a campaign appearance the president had talked by telephone 
on thursday with saudi king fahd and with egyptian president hosni 
mubarak 
fitzwater said bush also talked to german chancellor helmut 
kohl italian prime minister giulio andreotti who will visit 
washington next month and dutch prime minister ruud lubbers 
besides trying to hold the arab coalition together the 
administration wants to make sure the western europeans support the 
drive to force an iraqi pullout 
defense secretary dick cheney said thursday that up to 100000 
additional us troops would be sent to the persian gulf in 
response to the continuing buildup and fortification of iraqi 
occupation forces in kuwait 
bakers trip to the region for which no date was announced 
will underscore us resolve to end the 12weekold occupation of 
the emirate 
a decision to send baker to egypt and possibly other arab 
countries will be made when bush meets next week with his four 
principal advisers baker cheney national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and joint chiefs of staff chairman colin powell said 
the officials who requested anonymity 
meanwhile the state department announced that jordan was in 
compliance with un sanctions against iraq and suggested that 
wealthy countries such as saudi arabia help the stricken jordanian 
economy 
although state department spokesman richard boucher did not 
explicitly urge saudi arabia to end its oil cutoff and ease its icy 
stance toward king husseins government the message was obvious 
the saudis have been very forthcoming and generous boucher 
said 
jordan fell into disfavor both in washington and in saudi arabia 
when it hesitated on applying sanctions against iraq after the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait

charles keating jr might testify before the 
senate ethics committee if guaranteed his words wont be used 
against him elsewhere his lawyer suggested 
keating the arizona developer who controlled lincoln savings 
and loan association is a central figure in the nations savings 
and loan debacle experts say lincoln may be the costliest failed 
thrift ever at 2 billion keating faces a multitude of civil and 
criminal charges 
the los angeles times reported this week that the ethics 
committee was considering giving him limited immunity to testify in 
its probe of five senators to whose campaigns and causes keating 
gave 13 million the report were subsequently denied 
mr keating has a wealth of information and insight his 
attorney stephen neal said after a court session friday in a 
keating securities fraud case 
if it were up to mr keating he would be talking to all of 
you about it at the present time that is just not appropriate 
neal said 
but he added if i were an appointed or an elected public 
official i would think long and hard about ways to enable mr 
keating to share the information and insights he has on all of the 
issues including campaign financing 
asked if he was open to offers neal said i certainly will 
receive or return a phone call 
keating in his first court appearance since he was released 
from jail on bail last week stood beside his attorney but declined 
to comment 
the ethics committee is investigating whether sen alan 
cranston dcalif and four others improperly intervened with 
federal regulators on keatings behalf also being scrutinized are 
sens dennis deconcini dariz donald w riegle jr dmich 
john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz 
the judge at the hearing friday said he will unseal transcripts 
of secret grand jury proceedings in the criminal case but delayed 
disclosure for a week to give lawyers the chance to appeal 
superior court judge lance ito rejected arguments by lawyers for 
the developer and his codefendants who said publicity surrounding 
such a disclosure would damage the chances of finding unbiased 
jurors for the trial 
ito accepted the position of lawyers for the orange county 
register and the los angeles times who argued that first amendment 
case law supports free access to court records 
the judge said he would excise from the 4600page transcript 
the prosecutions opening statement and closing argument which he 
said were slanted against the defendants and might be prejudicial 
keating and three officials of his companies are accused of 
fraud in the sale of junk bonds at branches of lincoln savings 
which he controlled through his american continental corp the 
maximum penalty is 10 years he has pleaded innocent 
keatings extravagant personal habits and investments in 
highrisk highyield junk bonds and risky real estate ventures 
have made him a central figure in the savings and loan crisis 
he maintains hes being made a scapegoat by regulators and 
legislators hoping to avert blame for the debacle themselves 
on a defense request the judge delayed until nov 9 a hearing 
on motions to throw out the 42count indictment on which the 
66yearold keating was jailed for 33 days until he posted a 
reduced bail of 300000 last week

last week hightower cut off the tip of his finger while mowing 
after a news conference thursday hightower quipped i managed 
to put my finger under a lawn mower if youll check your manual 
and remember what your mama said and what common sense tells us is 
dont do that

is a shot at a us senate seat worth 3 million 
james rappaport a republican running against incumbent 
democratic incumbent john kerry has thrown more than 3 million of 
his own money into the race so far 
kerry has raised about 5 million without spending any of his 
own money 
all of this for a job paying 98400 
given the importance of paid media advertisements in 
campaigns today it is sad but true that especially in a 
democraticdominated state it is virtually impossible to run a 
campaign against an entrenched incumbent unless one has significant 
personal means said rappaport campaign spokesman richard gaines 
rappaports spending still pales in comparison to the 12 
million in personal funds that sen jay rockefeller dwva spent 
in 1984 to win his first race for the senate

worried by iraqs attempts to divide the west italy 
wants to reaffirm a common stand on the persian gulf crisis at this 
weekends european community summit in the italian capital 
the twoday meeting that begins late today offers the 12 ec 
leaders their first chance to sit together to discuss the crisis 
caused by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
plans for european monetary economic and political union are 
also on the agenda for the meeting italy is playing host to the 
summit as part of its sixmonth term as community president 
a government spokesman pio mastrobuoni said friday that italy 
wants the summit to produce a renewed commitment of ec solidarity 
and coordination in the persian gulf 
the ec must maintain complete cohesion if it wants to have 
credibility in the rest of the world he said 
mastrobuoni said italy is concerned by recent signs of 
discrepancies in the way west european countries have dealt 
with the situation of the hundreds of foreign hostages in iraq and 
kuwait 
he said iraqs decision to allow all french citizens to leave 
could give president saddam hussein the impression he can divide 
the multinational alliance lined up against him 
the motto all for one and one for all should remain the 
spokesman said we must stay united we cant give the impression 
that the front has been weakened 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis traveled to cairo on 
friday for talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak who 
recently visited several countries in the persian gulf region 
officials said mubaraks evaluation of the situation would be 
conveyed to the ec leaders 
the summit is also expected to review the communitys plans for 
integration in advance of middecember meetings in rome to formally 
institute the program 
mastrobuoni said italy will propose that the leaders set dec 
31 1993 as the date for creation of a european central bank and a 
common currency the idea s bound to upset british prime minister 
margaret thatcher who is against the proposals 
the spokesman said italy also hopes the summit achieves some 
consensus on the giving the ec a common foreign and security 
policy 
the leaders are also expected to discuss the economic troubles 
of the soviet union although no new aid offers appear likely 
negotiators in luxembourg on friday sought to keep the divisive 
issue of farm subsidies off the rome agenda jacques delors 
president of the ecs executive body said it could be 
disastrous if the agriculture and trade ministers are unable to 
break the deadlock before the summit 
german chancellor helmut kohl whose government faces elections 
in december is against a proposal for 30 percent cuts in farm 
subsidies over 10 years his aides insist on special aid to offset 
any income losses suffered by farmers france and ireland back 
germany in the dispute

us industries are threatening formal action 
to get the government to penalize thailand for tolerating piracy of 
american movies music books computer software and trademarks 
major copyright industry groups said friday that unless the thai 
government cracks down immediately on known pirates they will file 
a trade complaint on nov 15 that could lead to new penalty duties 
on thai exports to the united states 
the warning was issued in a joint letter to thai ambassador 
vitthya vejjajiva from the motion picture export association of 
america the recording industry association of america and the 
international intellectual property alliance 
the letter said industry representatives have provided the thai 
government with the names and addresses of known pirates who 
operate blatantly and apparently without any fear that the thai 
enforcement authorities would take any action 
unless the actions we have requested are taken 
immediately the groups will file a formal trade complaint 
under section 301 of the us trade act of 1974 it added 
the alliance estimated in a statement that piracy of records 
tapes videos books and software in thesoutheast asian country 
loses american originators more than 60 million a year 
calling thailand the worst offender of intellectual property 
rights in asia motion picture association chairman jack valenti 
said thai pirates steal from our member countries 1015 
million annually in potential revenues 
illegal copies of american movies are on sale throughout 
thailand within days of their release in the united states and well 
before their legitimate release in thailand he said american 
movies are increasingly screened without license by illegal thai 
cable tv systems outside of bangkok 
recording industry association president jay berman said we 
have worked closely with thai officials and have been more than 
patient in awaiting promised government action to prosecute known 
audio pirates doing many thousands of dollars of illicit business 
daily the thai government in blatant disregard of us record 
companies and in violation of its international obligations has 
simply refused to prosecute these criminals 
eric h smith general counsel of the property alliance said in 
a statement that us record and motion picture industry 
representatives have been threatened physically in thailand when 
they seek enforcement of their rights 
the thai government has simply refused to move against the 
pirates despite repeated us government and private sector 
entreaties he said 
at the time of thai prime minister chatichai choonhavans visit 
to washington last june it was reported in bangkok that the prime 
minister might offer to step up the war against the flow of 
narcotics to the west in exchange for leniency on the intellectual 
property problem 
in 1989 the us government put thailand on a priority watch 
list because of the issue and withheld duty concessions on 165 
million worth of thai exports to the united states no further 
action was taken however and thailand enjoyed a 14 billion 
trade surplus with america for the year

federal arts regulators must consider general 
standards of decency when awarding grants under a mildly worded 
admonition against obscenity that neared approval in congress 
today 
a house and senate conference committee agreed late friday night 
to accept the houses compromise antiobscenity provisions for the 
national endowment for the arts 
it dropped provisions sponsored in the senate by sen jesse 
helms rnc that would have banned federal support for any works 
that denigrate religious objects or beliefs 
the agreement came on a conference report on the nearly 12 
billion interior department and related appropriations bill for 
fiscal 1991 which includes 175 million for the nea 
also included was a threeyear extension of the arts endowment 
a reauthorization expected to lessen pressure on congress for new 
antiobscenity arts provisions next year 
the aopted house language says that obscenity lacks artistic 
merit is not protected speech under the constitution and shall 
not be funded 
it contains a disputed provision that instructs the nea chairman 
to ensure that grants are awarded taking into consideration 
general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs 
and values of the american public 
the interior spending bill was expected to go to the full house 
and senate today 
conferees were meeting again today to resolve one remaining 
disagreement on an offshore oildrilling moratorium in selected 
areas which sen bennett johnston dla wanted removed 
conferees sought the final agreement in hopes they could report 
full agreement on all elements a move that would avoid amendments 
that could pick apart the package 
both the house and senate decided earlier to scrap explicit 
antiobscenity restrictions that congress slapped on the nea a year 
ago under pressure from helms and other conservatives 
instead both chambers would leave judgments of obscenity to the 
courts and require the nea to get its money back from grant 
recipients whose federally subsidized works are ruled obscene in 
state courts 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
said the senate conferees decided not to press for the religious 
denigration prohibition the house chairman rep sid yates 
dill sought to have house conferees agree to drop the mild house 
obscenity language but lost on a 63 vote at that point byrd said 
the senate would go along with the house 
i have my own viewpoint with respect to the arts byrd said 
but i see no point at this juncture to continue to wrestle 
with that 
the agreement apparently ends a long debate over the propriety 
of art receiving subsidies from the nea a controversy touched off 
by explicit homoerotic photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
that received indirect federal support

israeli leftists and palestinians are 
lambasting a government report that says police shot arab 
stonethrowers in self defense earlier this month farright 
leaders say the document hurts jewish interests 
lessradical rightwing parties say the report released friday 
bolstered israels earlier declarations that the rioters were 
chiefly to blame for the violence oct 8 in which police gunfire 
killed 20 palestinians 
the 59page report written by a threeman investigative 
committee appointed by prime minister yitzhak shamir drew 
immediate criticism from leftists and arabs 
the impression given by the first announcement of the report 
is that the committee sees the deaths of about 20 palestinians and 
the injury of more than 100 palestinians as a necessity that cannot 
be condemned said legislator yair tsaban of the leftwing mapam 
party 
if this is true this report will create great dissension not 
only in the world but in israel tsaban said 
in the oct 8 riot on temple mount in jerusalems walled old 
city more than 140 people were wounded by gunshots in addition to 
those killed according to hospitals police initially listed 19 
dead but fridays report increased the toll to 20 
police opened fire after moslems on temple mount started 
throwing rocks at jews praying at the western wall below 
in an oct 12 resolution the un security council condemned 
the use of excessive force and ordered a un team to investigate 
israel has refused to allow the inquiry 
the united states joined in the condemnation and supported the 
inquiry stirring israeli anger washington is israels chief ally 
countering the un plan israel has offered instead to submit 
its own report but that idea has been rejected and has no 
chances of being accepted now according to a senior government 
official quoted by israel television 
in israel two parties the liberal shinui and the communists 
have called on the government to cooperate with a un 
investigation 
the countrys lessradical rightwing parties welcomed the 
reports conclusions 
it was shown without doubt that there was a clear provocation 
on the part of arab worshipers on the mount there was no 
other choice but to respond in this way said religious affairs 
minister avner shaki of the national religious party 
the report said police were justified in resorting to live 
gunfire on stonethrowers it said palestinians started the riot 
but it also said there was indiscriminate fire by police and 
leveled stinging criticism at senior police commanders for ignoring 
signs that rioting might break out in the tense atmosphere 
palestinian leaders criticized the investigating panel 
it was only an editing committee that was just making a 
formula for the position of the israeli government i believe that 
we must have a neutral committee that can come from the united 
nations said faisal husseini a prominent palestinian leader 
from east jerusalem 
the report also drew fire from israels far right rabbi moshe 
levinger a leader of the jewish settlement movement said the 
whole investigation was a most serious mistake that can harm 
israel 
gershon salomon the head of a jewish group widely blamed for 
provoking moslems said he was glad the committee put the 
responsibility on the arab rioters and killers

about 800 daily news editorial workers struck 
friday rather than accept managements order to cross picket lines 
set up by eight other unions at the financially troubled tabloid 
management at the nations secondlargest city daily flew in the 
replacement workers to help circumvent a violent strike that began 
thursday night when 1800 employees walked out 
substitutes were imported from tribune co newspapers in 
orlando fla and chicago officials of the daily news which is 
owned by the company said the paper would be on newsstands this 
weekend 
daily news director of labor relations edward gold said the 
paper would begin replacing workers if they failed to show up at 
work as soon as possible the newspaper has 2600 unionized 
employees 
this is not a typical labor strike situation said political 
reporter frank lombardi theyve declared an allout war on the 
unions they dont want negotiation they want total 
capitulation 
union contracts expired in march 
the news using management and replacement workers claimed it 
printed and distributed 611000 copies of fridays newspaper the 
normal daily circulation is 118 million second only to the los 
angeles times among metropolitan newspapers 
but deliveries of the single edition were spotty at best after 
firebombs rocks and other projectiles were hurled at delivery 
trucks leaving plants in new jersey brooklyn and long island 
the daily news was unavailable at rush hour at many midtown 
manhattan newsstands suburban railroad stations and other spots in 
the metropolitan area 
the content was limited as well the paper had just 48 pages 
with just 7 pages of local domestic and international news 
articles in comparison last fridays paper contained 116 pages 
sporadic violence was reported again friday night cars and 
buses carrying replacement workers again were pelted with rocks as 
they drove from the brooklyn plant two strikers were arrested on 
charges of reckless endangerment police spokesman mark warren

the news has lost about 115 million and seen daily circulation 
slip by about 700000 in the past 10 years

battle for tabloid survival in the city new york newsday and the 
new york post printed additional copies in an effort to pick up 
news readers 
outside the news highrise headquarters on 42nd street pickets 
marched and union leaders told workers to head home for the day 
editorial employees from the newspaper guild initially honored 
the picket lines then joined the strike at what was billed as an 
informational meeting friday afternoon 
barry lipton the local guild president said the decision to 
strike was made after the news told union officials that 
replacement workers had already filled some editorial jobs 
the news has taken a hard line in its negotiations with the 
unions saying it must eliminate labor abuse to save 50 million to 
70 million a year the unions say the paper is trying to break 
them 
michael alvino president of the 700member drivers union 
called the strike at about 10 pm after 60 drivers with the most 
seniority were fired and replaced with nonunion workers union 
workers had walked out early thursday after management ordered one 
worker to stand rather than sit on the job 
the only one of 10 unions not involved in the strike is the new 
york typographical union whose 200 members have lifetime 
guaranteed jobs 
late thursday replacement workers driving delivery trucks were 
attacked in new york and new jersey eleven arrests and two minor 
injuries were reported 
this vandalism and outright violence by the strikers is 
deplorable said john sloan the news vice president for labor 
relations these are orchestrated and purposeful criminal acts

am in neighboring harrison nj although no one was injured

the jewish lobby and provocative 
commercials for perfume and lingerie are among the subjects 
american troops stationed in saudi arabia are being advised not to 
discuss with their hosts 
in a pamphlet written by the us central command the pentagon 
is advising us troops that those and other topics should be 
avoided or handled carefully the pamphlet was printed for 
distribution to some of the estimated 200000 american service men 
and women in and around saudi arabia 
topping the list of 15 sensitive items is articles and 
stories showing usisraeli ties and friendship the pamphlet 
also suggests restraint in discussion of antiarab demonstrations 
or sentiments in the united states and of us involvement in 
supporting israel and israels current presence in lebanon 
the pentagon which advises troops to carry the booklet at all 
times also suggests that the americans avoid discussing or showing 
sensual advertisements for perfume blue jeans womens lingerie 
gambling alcohol etc ads for pork or shellfish which are 
forbidden by islam 
other outofbounds topics include 
discussing the jewish lobby and us intelligence given to 
israel 
referring to the arab blacklisting of us companies that do 
business with israel or the arab boycotting of companies that have 
strong zionist representation in executive positions 
jewish groups have protested the list first published in the 
november issue of harpers magazine 
the world jewish congress said in a letter to secretary of 
defense dick cheney that it wanted to convey our sense of 
distress at what appears to be a capitulation to bigotry and a 
surrender of our democratic values 
the letter from wjc vice president kalman sultanik urges 
withdrawal of the material from circulation 
the american jewish committee expressing to cheney its deep 
sense of hurt and anger said us troops should not be asked to 
submerge entirely those values of tolerance pluralism and 
openmindedness that have made the us a unique democratic 
society 
the pentagon and state department mindful of the vast cultural 
and religious differences between saudis and americans have issued 
a number of booklets setting out dos and donts since the 
troops began arriving in the persian gulf in august 
most of the pamphlets include a brief history of saudi arabia 
and its monarchy and explanations of the strict moslem code which 
governs saudis behavior alcohol is out for moslems and for 
foreign troops so is socializing with saudi women 
other guidelines for americans found in the pamphlets are women 
should cover their legs and arms when out in public women and men 
should not show affection in public americans should not show the 
soles of their feet to a saudi by sitting with their legs propped 
on a table for example because the gesture is considered an 
insult americans shouldnt ask saudi men about their wives 
americans shouldnt offer their rations to saudis because they 
might contain pork which is forbidden by islam 
but the central command pamphlet goes beyond the social and 
cultural mores to include political topics 
in forging the international antiiraq coalition of western and 
arab nations the united states has been careful to avoid emphasis 
on its strategic and historic relationship with israel the largest 
recipient of american foreign aid 
saudi arabia and its allies in the arab world who have fought 
five wars with israel since it gained independence in 1948 have 
traditionally accused the united states of being biased toward the 
jewish state 
the central command pamphlet was originally written several 
years ago for american troops taking part in the biannual bright 
star maneuvers with egypt said pentagon officials 
that version contained several additional guidelines which have 
been removed from the booklets distributed for operation desert 
shield said the officials the omitted material includes 
discussing films or newsclips featuring prozionist actors and 
actresses eg barbara streisand liz taylor 
but pentagon spokesman lt commander ken satterfield said that 
material was not included in the new booklet

sponsors are putting on a final drive for 
approval of the first overhaul of legal immigration in 25 years 
designed to reunify families and bring more skilled workers to 
america 
we are providing a charter on how future americans will become 
future americans sen edward m kennedy dmass said friday 
night as the senate approved the compromise measure 898 
hours later however the bill snagged in the house where 
critics said the increase in visas for families was inadequate and 
condemned a pilot program for testing identification card security 
they said it would lead to a national id card similar to ones 
used in a police state 
the bill failed 235186 on a preliminary house vote late 
friday sponsors made technical changes and said they would try 
again later 
the measure would allow into the united states more people from 
countries in western europe and elsewhere that have been 
traditional sources of immigration but less so in recent years 
legislation designed to curb illegal immigration was approved by 
congress in 1986 but the current bill represents the first major 
reworking of the nations legal immigration system since 1965 
it would allow visas for 700000 individuals annually starting 
next oct 1 and for three years thereafter it would allot 465000 
visas for families of american citizens and permanent resident 
aliens and 140000 for immigrants with special job skills 
it would earmark 40000 admissions for people from countries 
such as ireland poland and italy that traditionally had been major 
sources of immigrants earlier in the nations history and 55000 
visas would be set aside for spouses and children of aliens 
legalized under the amnesty provisions of the 1986 legislation 
the original house version of the bill would have allowed an 
estimated 800000 immigrants a year compared with the current 
500000 the senate version would have resulted in an estimated 
630000 
from 1995 onward the bill would earmark 480000 visas for 
family members 140000 for those with special job skills and 
55000 for those from nations that have been traditional sources of 
immigrants 
under the bill the limit on immigration from hong kong would 
climb to 10000 a year and after 1994 to 27000 a year the 
provision was inserted in the bill at the urging of american 
companies that do business there 
the companies have been suffering a loss of key employees as the 
time approaches when control will pass from britain to china in 
1997 
the bill aims to assure chinese employees they will have plenty 
of opportunity to come to the united states later and that there is 
no need to get out now 
an estimated 30000 irish living in the united states illegally 
also would effectively receive amnesty 
in the senate roll call the opponents were sens william 
armstrong rcolo dale bumpers dark robert byrd dwva

lawmakers striving to rescue an omnibus 
anticrime bill before congress goes home performed emergency 
surgery cutting death penalty provisions and curbs on 
semiautomatic assault weapons 
this is a farce rep henry j hyde rill said friday 
after house and senate negotiators also erased the last traces of 
the anticrime proposals sent to congress by president bush two 
years ago 
the cutting was designed to make the measure more acceptable all 
around liberals took a dim view of the death penalty while 
conservatives were cool to restrictions on assault weapons 
early today house and senate conferees were still trying to 
figure out a way to preserve one controversial provision which 
would allow the government to seize the homes of those accused of 
savings and loan fraud 
provisions remaining in the bill were ones that had not caused 
fireworks its a mini crime bill now said sen strom 
thurmond rsc 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
said the bill should have contained death penalty and assault 
weapons provisions as passed the senate bill prescribed the death 
penalty for crimes ranging from presidential assassination to 
murder of a federal egg inspector 
the house version was similar the senate version also would 
have imposed curbs on nine semiautomatic assault weapons lawmakers 
said both provisions were guaranteed to cause filibustering that 
would kill the bill 
it still has a number of significant provisions biden said 
of the compromise version 
details were still being settled but lawmakers were aiming for 
a bill including grants for treatment of abused children 
tightening curbs on chemicals used in drug manufacture and a 
program to set up boot camp prisons 
other provisions would address victim rights juvenile justice 
prisoner drug testing and a host of other issues the bill would 
authorize additional fbi and drug enforcement agents as well as 
more federal prosecutors 
lawmakers erased language that would have allowed courts to 
consider evidence gathered with flawed warrants also eliminated 
was a racial justice provision that would have allowed death 
row inmates appealing their sentences to use statistical evidence 
of racial bias on the part of the court 
biden said that while he would have preferred additional 
provisions it was necessary to be realistic about the support 
available for the bill 
it signifies that when you are in a situation where you have a 
determined minority in the republican and democratic parties that 
say theyre going to filibuster everything they can do it he

foreign investors will be allowed to own companies 
in the soviet union under a new set of decrees issued by president 
mikhail s gorbachev to help move the soviet union to a 
marketbased economy in two years 
the decrees issued friday also sharply devalue the ruble 
they were announced as gorbachev opened a threeday state visit 
to spain where he hopes to obtain further economic aid and 
increase trade with the west 
the national legislature voted last month to give gorbachev 
farreaching power to order economic changes by decree 
although the legislature has not yet approved a detailed 
blueprint for the transition from a centrally planned economy to a 
market one it has generally agreed on the concept 
one decree announced friday says foreign investors can establish 
enterprises in the soviet union either in joint ventures with 
soviet firms or with 100 percent foreign ownership in the past 
soviet firms had to retain majority control 
the decree also permits soviet citizens to buy shares in 
enterprises purchase bonds and hold other securities either 
singly or in registered groups the official soviet news agency 
tass reported 
profits of foreign investors can be reinvested or transferred 
abroad under rules promulgated by the soviet legislature the 
decree said it did now say when the new rules would be announced 
or when they would take effect 
foreign investors on soviet territory will enjoy legal 
protection and conditions cannot be less favorable than the 
corresponding conditions for the property of soviet organizations 
enterprises and citizens of the ussr the decree said 
the decree on stock ownership will have little immediate impact 
because the soviet union does not yet have a stock exchange 
however officials have been discussing opening an exchange and 
recently sought advice from visiting representatives of the new 
york stock exchange 
the new commercial exchange rate for the ruble will go into 
effect on thursday cutting the value of the soviet currency by 
nearly 70 percent to spur exports and reduce imports 
ivan ivanov deputy chairman of the state foreign economic 
commission had warned this month a devaluation was coming 
it will make exports more profitable for soviet producers and 
facilitate the streamlining and restriction of imports which have 
been growing rapidly since soviet enterprises were granted the 
right of free access to the foreign market he said 
devaluation of the ruble though affects only one of the two 
official exchange rates 
the new exchange rate for international commercial transactions 
will be 18 rubles per us dollar compared to the current 56 
rubles to the dollar this is the rate used by soviet and foreign 
companies 
the rate for foreign tourists exchanging money in the soviet 
union will remain unchanged at 6 rubles to the dollar the soviet 
government introduced the tourist rate this year largely to combat 
black market activity 
both rates are set artificially by the soviet government and 
neither reflects the real worth of the ruble either to companies 
trading commodities or tourists trying to buy soviet wares such as 
a matryoshka doll 
on the black market a dollar can fetch 15 to 30 rubles many 
international companies get around the artificial exchange rates by 
bartering goods such as pepsi for stolichnaya vodka 
still the new exchange rate is somewhat more realistic than the 
old one and should make some transactions easier 
on thursday gorbachev ordered governmentrun banks to pay 
higher interest rates on ruble savings accounts beginning nov 1 
as a move to persuade depositors to keep their money in banks 
despite the devaluation 
soviet banks now pay 2 percent or 3 percent annual interest on 
savings accounts depending on the term of the deposit under 
gorbachevs decree soviets will earn 5 percent to 10 percent 
interest on their money depending on how long they promise to 
leave it on deposit

gubernatorial candidate jon grunseth 
admitted during a televised debate that he had wild years but 
denied swimming nude with girls 
as grunseth debated two challengers friday fellow republicans 
pressured him to quit the race fearing his troubles could drag 
them down to defeat 
i cant say jon you have to get off the ticket i 
dont have that kind of power said us sen rudy boschwitz 
but i can talk to him and tell him i think he has a future and he 
should not endanger that future by running in a threeman race and 
coming in third 
grunseth is trying to unseat incumbent gov rudy perpich a 
democrat seeking an unprecedented fourth term state auditor arne 
carlson who lost to grunseth in the republican primary began a 
writein campaign after grunseth became entangled in the 
nudeswimming allegations 
during friday nights debate grunseth said he went through a 
wild years period a decade ago when he was separated from his 
first wife and later divorced but he said the allegations he swam 
nude with teenage girls at a 1981 pool party are untrue 
the legend of jon grunseth has been grossly exaggerated he 
said there are things ive done in my life i wish i hadnt done 
thats not unlike most of us 
perpich blasted grunseth during the debate for having said the 
governor was behind the allegations two young women brought against 
grunseth 
the women said in sworn statements that grunseth invited them 
and two other teenagers to join him for the nude swim they said 
they declined but that grunseth and the other girls took off their 
clothes 
one of the women also said grunseth tried to pull down her 
bathing suit top and touch her breast 
people who know me know that i wouldnt even think of this 
perpich said why would i want to hurt your family or you why 
would i do that this is an outrage 
grunseth has called perpich the supreme liar for denying any 
connection but has admitted he has no proof perpich was involved 
boschwitz seeking reelection to the us senate said 
grunseths troubles are hurting the campaigns of all republicans in 
minnesota 
it has an impact on dozens of people who are running for the 
state legislature who are out there knocking on doors and working 
their hearts out and i really dont want to see those people hurt 
nor myself he said 
but grunseth isnt quitting his campaign director elam baer 
said friday 
grunseth called a news conference thursday to announce he was 
dropping out of the race but decided at the last minute to stay 
in 
last night we slammed the door shut nailed a couple of 
spikes in it and locked the deadbolts and he is in this race until 
nov 6 baer said

three former northwest airlines pilots the 
first to be convicted of flying a commercial jetliner while 
intoxicated said theyre relieved they didnt get longer prison 
sentences 
its less than what i expected capt norman lyle prouse 
51 of conyers ga said after being sentenced friday to 16 months 
in prison 
first officer robert kirchner 36 of highland ranch colo and 
flight engineer joseph balzer 35 of antioch tenn each were 
sentenced to 12 months in prison 
us district judge james rosenbaum also ordered three years of 
probation for each man after release from prison but levied no 
fines while on probation the pilots cant fly planes with 
passengers 
kirchner and balzer were freed pending appeals of their 
convictions prouse didnt ask to be freed pending an appeal but 
the judge gave him five days to file a request 
gentlemen you are good men who have done a bad thing the 
judge told the three 
who can comprehend an entire crew alcohol impaired 
rosenbaum said it is a crime against our sense of security in 
that sense all of us are a victim of this crime 
bruce hanley attorney for balzer said the judge may have been 
influenced by a tide of letters urging leniency the letters which 
the judge talked about in court came from friends and families of 
the pilots there were no letters from passengers of the flight or 
others who might have been outraged the judge said 
people were not writing crucify these people hanley said 
after sentencing 
rosenbaum said the risks of piloting innocent civilians to 
their untimely deaths must be weighed against pain of the pilots 
families 
peter wold attorney for prouse said he feared rosenbaum would 
sentence his client to six years or more in prison william mauzy 
attorney for kirchner said he was relieved the sentence was at 
the low end of the federal guidelines recommending 12 months to 18 
months in prison 
the maximum penalty is 15 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
im very willing to do what the judge has said balzer told 
reporters its been a pressure cooker for a long time i go from 
here 
im grateful kirchner said 
each of the defense attorneys argued for prison terms of less 
than 12 months they said a presentence investigation report 
erroneously found that each of the defendants had not taken 
responsibility for his actions 
the prosecutor elizabeth de la vega said i think overall it 
was an appropriate sentence i think it sends a message to 
pilots 
it was the first federal prosecution under a 1986 law making it 
a felony to operate a commercial airplane under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol 
the three on march 8 flew a boeing 727 from fargo nd after a 
night of heavy drinking at a bar the plane carrying 91 people 
flew smoothly and landed safely at minneapolisst paul 
international airport where the pilots were arrested 
what difference does it make that you landed the flight 
safely rosenbaum said the danger was there 
prouse admitted to drinking more than 15 rumandcola drinks at 
the bar balzer and kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer 
northwest fired the pilots the federal aviation administration 
stripped their licenses

world war ii faces eviction from the home the war hero helped build 
40 years ago 
pauline gagnon had planned to turn the home which includes her 
travel agency into a museum for her husbands pictures war medals 
and a flag that flew over iwo jima 
but she ran into financial trouble and the house was sold at a 
foreclosure auction during the summer shes been living there 
while she fights in court to overturn the sale 
her troubles are the latest for the family of war hero rene 
gagnon who died of a heart attack at age 54 in 1979 gagnon who 
once said being a war hero was a blessing and a curse was troubled 
by alcohol abuse throughout his life his drinking got him fired 
from one job on memorial day 1978

of the home and would be heartbroken to see it taken from her the 
photograph of her husband and his companions struggling to raise 
the flag still is on display in the onestory threebedroom house 
mrs gagnon said her husband a marine never overestimated his 
wartime contribution despite the celebrity it brought him 
he said he just did his job she said they just said go 
do it and he did 
according to accounts from iwo jima three marines were trying 
to hoist the makeshift flagpole on feb 23 1945 but it was too 
heavy two more joined in and then someone called gagnon as the 
six raised the pole associated press photographer joe rosenthal

national cemetery in virginia the memorial commemorates the 5931 
marines who died taking the pacific island 
gagnon was buried at arlington but only after his widow argued 
for two years with officials who said he didnt qualify for

couldnt win approval of her plans to subdivide it 
she maintains in court that resource financial group which sold 
the mortgage and two women who bought it took advantage of her 
plight she has asked the court to reverse the sale and release her 
from the mortgage 
on wednesday a judge gave her 10 days to post a 100000 bond or 
face eviction the bond is in case she loses her court fight 
rene gagnon was 19 when he fought on iwo jima after the war he 
took a brief fling at a movie career playing himself in the john 
wayne film sands of iwo jima 
that was the extent of his acting career mrs gagnon told him 
to choose between acting or marriage and marriage won 
he was fired from his job as a night manager of a manchester 
hotel in 1978 because of his drinking the firing came on memorial 
day and created a furor 
he once said all the people who wanted to buy a war hero a drink 
helped fuel his alcohol problems 
thats the basis of society he said in 1978 it thinks 
the biggest thing it can offer you is a drink

tourism officials worry about a 
possible economic disaster this season as visitors cancel florida 
trips because of an outbreak of sometimesfatal st louis 
encephalitis 
the industry already was vulnerable before the mosquitoborne 
disease hit said john rutherford spokesman for the orlando 
visitors and convention bureau which serves the walt disney world 
area 
theyre dealing with a triple whammy theres a slow economy 
high gas prices and now mosquitoes rutherford said 
he said hotel occupancy and airport arrival rates in the orlando 
area have shown flat growth or a slight downturn in the past few 
months 
as of friday there were 63 confirmed encephalitis cases 66 
suspected cases and 28 presumed cases three people have died 
st louis encephalitis is a virus carried by birds and spread to 
humans by the bite of a particular mosquito primarily at night 
health officials say 
historically st louis encephalitis is most common in august 
september and october and drops off in colder weather but tourism 
officials say they cant wait 
we may have a disaster in the making for the florida tourism 
industry ronald rose executive director of the jensen beach 
chamber of commerce wrote to the state commerce department 
rose accused the state health department of causing a 
statewide panic representatives from the department of health 
and rehabilitative services are stressing that the outbreak isnt a 
medical epidemic 
an epidemic puts it in the publics mind as something thats 
out of control and requiring draconian procedures said dr 
robert calder head hrs epidemiologist 
the situation isnt out of control by any means people are 
actually changing their vacation plans due to st louis 
encephalitis which is not called for at all 
the last encephalitis outbreak struck florida in 1977 infecting 
110 people and killing eight 
the commerce department started playing a public service hot 
line message oct 17 telling prospective tourists that incidence 
of encephalitis is considered very low and affecting only 
five people in a million 
the division of tourism distributed more than 7000 pamphlets 
about st louis encephalitis and tips on how to avoid mosquito 
bites 
but tourists should not be lulled into a false sense of 
security health experts say 
dr charles mahan head hrs health officer said that although 
st louis encephalitis is easily avoidable you cant poohpooh 
it its a serious disease and people have died from it

the security council prepared to adopt a 
resolution today holding iraqi officials liable for war damages and 
economic losses caused by its invasion of kuwait diplomats said 
there will be a large vote in favor said the council 
president british ambassador sir david hannay 
the new resolution set for a vote at midday today was the 10th 
since the invasion on aug 2 
in previous resolutions the 15member council has isolated iraq 
with an economic embargo and permitted un member countries to use 
flotillas of warships in the persian gulf to enforce it the 
council also has demanded that iraq withdraw from kuwait and 
release all hostages 
the draft resolution supported by at least 13 nations invites 
nations companies and individuals to document their damage and 
losses for the council but does not establish a system for making 
claims against baghdad 
the proposal also demands that iraq stop taking hostages and 
mistreating and oppressing kuwaiti and thirdstate nationals 
it also moves toward establishing iraqs responsibility for war 
crimes inviting nations to collect information on serious abuses 
of civilians contrary to the fourth geneva convention of 1949 and 
to share it with the council 
the convention which iraq signed protects the rights of 
civilians in wartime or in militaryoccupied territory outlawing 
summary execution torture deportations and hostagetaking 
although the new resolution holds iraq liable for war damages 
it does not provide for punitive reparations 
kuwaiti ambassador mohammad a abulhasan estimated that iraq has 
less than 800 million in assets in the united states which will 
pay 22 billion more in energy costs in a year due to the rise in 
oil prices following the invasion 
the draft resolution also says iraq must allow the immediate 
provision of food water and basic services to diplomats and 
foreigners in diplomatic missions in kuwait city 
iraq says kuwait is now a province of iraq and that the 
diplomats must move their operations to baghdad it has cut off 
water and electricity to the embassies the us british and 
french compounds are the last western holdouts 
the proposed resolution asks secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to use his influence to see that the demands are met and 
he is encouraged to be available to assist in reaching a peaceful 
solution to the crisis 
the draft threatens iraq with unspecified new punishment under 
chapter 7 of the un charter if it doesnt obey all its 
resolutions 
chapter 7 allows punitive action up to and including 
collective use of military force 
western diplomats conceded they have few new major actions they 
can take to pressure iraq aside from severing telephone fax and 
cables services and retaliating against baghdads embassies 
in coming resolutions the council could establish the mechanisms 
for making economic claims against iraq and could take concrete 
steps toward establishing a war crimes tribunal 
iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari said the latest resolution 
was a preparation so that someone can eventually say well we 
have exhausted all possible resolutions of the security councils 
authority it is now time now to use force

come for a military strike to force iraq from his homeland 
the un security council was expected to overwhelmingly adopt a 
resolution today holding iraqi officials liable for war damages and 
economic losses caused by its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 said 
diplomats including the council president british ambassador sir 
david hannay 
nations companies and individuals suffering losses would be 
able to apply to the security council for damages the proposal 
also invites nations to submit information on abuses of kuwaitis 
and other civilians contrary to the fourth geneva convention 
it threatens iraq with unspecified new punishment under the un 
charter if it doesnt stop mistreating and oppressing kuwaitis and 
release foreign hostages 
iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari said the draft resolution 
was a preparation so that someone can eventually say well we 
have exhausted all possible resolutions of the security councils 
authority it is now time now to use force 
the united nations already has condemned iraq for its invasion 
and ordered an international embargo on iraqi trade to force iraqi 
president saddam hussein to withdraw his forces from kuwait 
saddam prevented thousands of foreigners from leaving iraq and 
kuwait after the invasion hundreds have since been released as 
saddam apparently tries to pry concessions from western governments 
in exchange for their citizens freedom 
iraq has said french nationals would be free to leave beginning 
today france insisted no deal was struck to win their freedom 
two irishmen flew home from iraq on friday saying saddam hussein 
granted them permission to leave as thanks for good work on his new 
palace 
western diplomats in baghdad said iraqi troops had seized two 
american men who had evaded capture in kuwait for weeks they were 
identified as uwe jahnke 47 of washington depot conn and john 
stevenson 44 of panama city fla 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the two 
were brought to baghdad on monday and taken to a hotel where scores 
of other foreigners are being held 
iraq on friday gave new indications it might be willing to 
negotiate a settlement saddam told channel 3 radio of algiers 
algeria when the greater interest demands it everything is open 
to consideration but he went on to rule out ceding our 
rights 
there were also reports from washington that saddam has adopted 
a scorchedearth strategy if his troops are forced out of 
kuwait 
administration sources said friday that iraq had used american 
and other hostages to wire kuwaits four oil refineries with 
plastic explosives capable of knocking out the emirates entire 
refining capacity 
iraq invaded kuwait in a dispute over oil land and money 
french officials denied any knowledge of a letter saddam 
reportedly sent to french and soviet leaders offering to discuss 
mideast problems 
french president francois mitterrand and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev are to hold two days of talks in paris 
beginning sunday the french television network la cinq said saddam 
told the two leaders he was open to all ideas in resolving the 
gulf crisis 
gorbachev opening a threeday visit to spain said friday we 
favor taking advantage of all possibilities for a politicial 
solution nevertheless no one should take the search for these 
joint or bilateral solutions as a sign of weakness or for 
vacillation over implementation of un security council 
resolutions 
president bush has asked baker to visit saudi arabia early next 
month for discussions on the persian gulf standoff the white house 
said friday press secretary marlin fitzwater said news reports 
that baker would ask the saudi government to approve military 
action against iraq were not true 
most nations including the united states have said the 
international economic boycott should be given time to work before 
a military attack is contemplated 
kuwaiti officials also have agreed with those declarations 
but now kuwaits exiled prime minister sheik saad alabdullah 
alsabah has appealed for a military strike to reclaim his own 
homeland even if it meant leaving the emirate in ruins a saudi 
newspaper reported friday 
as a citizen and a responsible official i am ready to 
sacrifice everything for the sake of regaining my land the saudi 
daily asharq alawsat quoted him as saying 
in other developments 
the pentagon is advising us troops to avoid discussions about 
usisraeli ties with their saudi hosts also on a list of taboo 
subjects are sensual commercials for perfume and lingerie 
the european community meets this weekend and italy said it 
will seek to reaffirm the ecs united stand on the gulf crisis

the plea bargain turned out to be no 
bargain 
rather than take chances on a jury verdict russell barnes 
accepted a prosecutors offer and pleaded guilty to one count of 
aggravated robbery in a mugging in return five other charges were 
dropped 
the decision cost him at least 3 years in prison moments 
earlier the jury had found him innocent of all charges 
james campbell a ramsey county district judge said he decided 
to let the jury read its verdicts thursday night for the benefit of 
attorneys who argued the case and to make a court record in case of 
appeal the judge asked barnes whether he wanted to hear the 
verdicts he did 
by then the judge had accepted the guilty plea and it was too 
late to withdraw it 
it was like o henry meets alfred hitchcock said richard 
coleman barnes public defender 
coleman said barnes went into shock and so did his lawyer 
his clients mother burst into tears a juror misinterpreting the 
tears and the defendants reaction as relief came up to 
congratulate barnes 19 of st paul 
coleman said his client acted against his advice my position 
had been to stick with the jury verdict but i can understand his 
fear 
if convicted of all six charges coleman said barnes would have 
faced up to 20 years in prison about a third of the time off for 
good behavior under the plea bargain he is to be sentenced to 
five years and four months and is expected to have to serve at 
least twothirds of it 
barnes was charged in an august incident in which he and others 
allegedly beat a st paul woman her two sons and a friend and 
robbed them of 600 
jurors who began deliberating tuesday twice said they were 
deadlocked and campbell decided to declare a mistrial at 930 pm 
thursday if there was no verdict but at 930 the jurors said they 
were making progress and wanted to continue deliberating 
about 1045 pm coleman said he called campbells chambers to 
say his client had decided to accept the plea agreement prosecutors 
offered earlier three assault charges and one each of burglary and 
simple robbery were dropped in exchange for the plea to aggravated 
robbery 
coleman then found out jurors had just told the bailiff they had 
a verdict but barnes stuck by his decision and entered his plea 
about 11 pm he entered a special plea under which he did not 
admit committing the crimes but conceded that he could be convicted 
based on the evidence

scientists have grown hair in a test tube a 
development they say could lead to a cure for baldness within a 
decade 
this is the real thing dr terence kealey head of a 
research team at cambridge universitys department of clinical 
biochemistry 
we have for the first time succeeded in getting hair to grow 
in vitro the balding scientist said friday 
kealey stressed in a bbc radio interview that growing hair in a 
test tube is not in itself a cure for baldness but he added 
it provides the perfect medium for experiments and could lead to 
effective treatment within 10 years 
the results of the research in which the hair was grown in a 
synthetic blood product are to be published in the journal of cell 
science next month 
experts welcomed the achievement saying it could lead to 
preventing hair loss in men genetically disposed to baldness 
any knowledge of how hair grows and metabolizes could have 
various offshoots in preventing baldness from happening said dr 
ken maxted a dermatologist with the glasgow health board who went 
bald at 18 
whether it is a cure for people who are bald im not quite 
sure i think its rather nice having a waterproof head he said 
in an interview 
dr john firmage a consultant at the scalp and hair hospital in 
london said the research was an important first step to 
understanding what affects hair growth and loss 
until now it has been very difficult to know what happens 
except that the process of balding is hereditary dr firmage said 
hence the many lotions and potions which are produced 
dr john romano at st vincents hospital and medical center in 
new york said scientists would be able to test new chemicals on 
testtube hair without worrying about injuring someones scalp 
researchers can use many more different chemicals because they 
dont have to worry about toxicity he said in a telephone 
interview 
kealey said the next step is to find out why many middleaged 
men suffer a disruption in the normal mechanism that triggers the 
growth of new replacement hair 
i hope that within 10 years we could come up with a cure for 
baldness he said 
the successful growth of test tube hair came after a team 
member dr michael philpott devised a method for extracting hair 
follicles from the skin without damaging the roots kealey said 
this is done by carefully slicing away the top two layers of 
skin to remove hair follicles with fine tweezers the follicles 
then are grown in a synthetic blood substitute maintained at body 
temperature he said 
watching hair growing in a test tube is an amazing sight 
kealey said it grows absolutely identical to normal hairs at 
the same rate of 0012 inches a day and in the same shape 
the research was funded by the anglodutch consumer giant 
unilever and britains science and engineering research council he 
said 
kealey said the research also could lead to a more effective 
depilatory for removing unwanted hair 
hairs grow for about two years and then spontaneously shed he 
said adding that a natural depilatory would result if the shedding 
process could be hastened 
in fact what we can do now in the laboratory is persuade 
hairs to shed in this very natural manner and so we hope that we 
might quite quickly start trying to work on improved 
depilatories kealey said 
cambridge university is known for its contributions to 
scientific research including discovery of the electron the 
neutron and the structure of dna the building blocks of genetic 
material 
kealey said that although he was thrilled at the teams 
breakthrough as an intellectual achievement it has to be viewed 
as rather trivial 
nevertheless many men will find the breakthrough welcome news 
since kealey said the onset of balding can be intensely 
traumatic maybe because it is the first visible sign of advancing 
age 
i am myself bald but i dont think its something that 
bothers me very much he added

hatteras island residents may have to use 
ferries for up to six months after the only bridge to the island 
was hit by a dredge toppling a 369foot section into oregon inlet 
tourism officials worried that island businesses could lose 
millions of dollars 
we estimate that if the bridge is out three months or more 
it will cost us between 18 and 20 million said gene obleness 
executive director of the dare county tourist bureau october and 
november are prime surffishing months on hatteras 
the bridge could be out for five to six months said clayton 
jenson superintendent of mclean contracting of mclean va which 
built the 26yearold herbert c bonner bridge 
a gale tore the dredge northerly island from its moorings 
slamming it into the bonner bridge early friday a section f the 
span collapsed an hour later no one was injured 
the bridge carries telephone and power lines to hatteras and 
the accident left some of those lines dangling over the inlet 
power was out on hatteras and on much of nearby ocracoke island 
south of hatteras in the barrier island chain that forms north 
carolinas coastal outer banks 
electric and telephone companies were waiting for weather 
conditions to ease before trying to restore service at hatteras 
but most of ocracokes power was restored by midafternoon friday 
water supplies also were limited on the islands state officials 
said 
gov jim martin declared a state of emergency after flying to 
the coast to survey the situation 
from what ive seen things are pretty well organized what 
can be done is being done and plans are being made for the future 
im pleased and impressed martin said after a briefing by county 
officials 
transportation secretary thomas harrelson said the state was 
looking at landing points for ferries and its options on setting up 
a temporary crossing of the bridge he estimated the work could 
cost 3 million 
ferries carrying up to 40 vehicles could be in service in about 
three weeks after ferry docks and access roads are constructed he 
said 
authorities said three landing craft would be available by 
monday to ferry supplies such as food and fuel and people across 
the inlet 
the islands estimated 5000 residents and an unknown number of 
tourists have had no way off the island ferry connections to 
ocracoke couldnt be used because winds were gusting to 60 mph 
creating waves of 5 to 7 feet in pamlico sound there is no bridge 
to ocracoke where about 500 people live 
among those waiting for a ride off ocracoke was david carper of 
ramseur and he wasnt looking forward to the trip 
ive never ridden a ferry i have motion sickness so it 
wouldnt be real fun carper said as he and his wife barbara 
waited at the ferry lounge but rather than live here until the 
bridge is repaired we thought wed take the ferry when we could

burleigh county jailers were puzzled when 
patrick kellar showed up for a court appearance at 430 am but 
kellar knew exactly what he was doing 
according to an account in the bismarck tribune the bismarck 
man arrived at the courthouse which also houses the county jail 
five minutes early on thursday and showed jailers a notice ordering 
him to appear in court on a contested speeding ticket at 430 am 
the jailers told kellar there would be no hearing at that hour 
they wrote a note to the county clerk saying that kellar had been 
there and sent him home 
some court employees wondered why kellar hadnt called the 
office beforehand to correct what obviously was a typographical 
error on his summons 
they discovered his motive when kellar called the office later 
in the day he read to the clerk the section of state law that says 
that if a defendant shows up in court at the appointed time and the 
prosecutor doesnt the case has to be dismissed 
judge gail hagerty dismissed the ticket

terrorists could be planning to attack a 
passenger ship or aircraft at any time the state department 
says 
the agency said friday night that the attack could come on a 
passenger ship in the eastern mediterranean sea or an aircraft in 
europe or the middle east 
the risk of acts of international terrorism in europe and the 
middle east is increasing said a statement from the departments 
deputy spokesman richard boucher 
he said the department had received specific and credible 
information about a threat to ships in the eastern mediterranean 
and added such an operation may be undertaken at any time 
he added we note that civil aviation remains a particular 
target 
the departments warning came after the unusual hour of 8 pm 
in part becauseits important that we share the threat 
information with the american people as they plan their travel 
said another spokesman adam shub 
terrorists have attacked ships before in october 1985 a group 
led by abu abbas hijacked the italian cruise ship achille lauro as 
it left an egyptian port holding it for two days before 
surrendering to egyptian authorities 
one of the hijackers shot to death an american passenger leon 
klinghoffer who was confined to a wheelchair 
a particular reason for concern friday was threats by the abu 
nidal organization which has repeatedly threatened to attack 
us interests if mahmoud atta a 37yearold us citizen and 
member of the organization is extradited to israel the department 
said 
atta who als uses the name mahmoud elabed ahmad is wanted in 
israel on charges of participating in the april 1986 machine gun 
attack on a bus carrying jewish settlers in the occupied west bank 
the driver was killed and a passenger wounded 
arrested in the united states three years ago atta fought 
extradition in the courts but lost his last appeal in the us 
supreme court on aug 31 the department has two months from that 
date to decide to turn him over to israel and friday night shub 
repeated earlier statements that it would do so 
the united states takes these threats very seriously in view 
of the anos notorious history boucher said 
shub said the nidal group was believed responsible for more than 
90 terrorist attacks since 1974 using the cover name black 
september it arranged the september 1970 hijacking of four 
airliners to an abandoned airfield in jordan he said 
among its attacks were bombings of the airports in vienna and 
rome in december 1985 the hijacking of a pan am airliner to 
karachi in 1986 and the attack on the day excursion vessel city of 
poros in greece in july 1986 the department said

thieves may have thought they were getting 
cute house pets when they broke into a zoo and made off with two 
squirrel monkeys 
wrong 
squirrel monkeys weigh a few pounds each and look adorable but 
they have a habit humans may find hard to stomach 
they rub their urine onto their hands and feet and tails so 
that while they run around theyre marking territory every time 
they touch something said ken rudman general curator of the 
sedgwick county zoo 
they really do smell awful at times actually thats most of 
the time rudman said theyre also aggressive he said 
many zoo visitors think the south american monkeys would make 
great pets rudman said id guess that whoever stole these was 
planning on having a neat pet to impress the friends with 
whoever took spock and mowgli by cutting through a security 
fence and crossing a moat in the zoo on monday night has since 
reconsidered 
on thursday someone checking into a motel about two miles from 
the zoo found an oddsmelling box in his room inside were spock 
and mowgli 
zoo monkeys read the label on the box return to the 
zoo

prime minister vp singh called a 
public rally today to try to contain a rebellion in his party and 
put a lid on growing pressure on him to resign 
environment minister maneka gandhi quit singhs cabinet on 
friday and released a letter accusing the prime minister of failing 
to keep his pledge of honesty and efficiency in government 
mrs gandhi was the first cabinet minister to break openly with 
singh since tuesday when a hindumoslem dispute over rights to a 
holy site ballooned into the worst political crisis of the 
10monthold government 
other dissidents of the governing janata dal party pressed for a 
change of leadership arguing that dumping singh could avert the 
governments collapse and the need for an immediate national 
election 
singh was scheduled to speak today at a rally outside his home 
in new delhi the capital 
at least 93 people have been killed this week in rioting between 
moslems and hindus and in police efforts to quell the disturbances 
the two latest deaths were reported today from a clash between 
police and a mob late friday in ranchi in the eastern state of 
bihar 
police clamped an overnight curfew on ayodhya site of the 
disputed holy place and on the neighboring town of faizabad on 
friday thousands of police reinforcements have been sent to the 
hindu holy town 300 miles southeast of new delhi 
hindu fundamentalists have vowed to build a temple at the site 
which they say is birthplace of lord rama an important hindu god 
a moslem mosque has stood there for 460 years 
police said they have detained 51000 people in uttar pradesh 
state and seized more than 35000 tribal spears tridents and other 
weapons from hindus on their way to ayodhya 
the uttar pradesh government has banned entry into the state by 
leaders of the hindu political movements behind the temple project 
the rightwing bharatiya janata party withdrew its support for 
the government when singh opposed the temple and arrested the 
partys leader who was on a crosscountry march to rouse support 
for the construction 
the partys move deprived the national front coalition of its 
majority in parliament 
singh faces a noconfidence motion in a special session of the 
legislature nov 7 barring a lastminute compromise or a 
realignment of political forces he seems certain to lose 
in addition to mrs gandhi four other parliament members once 
considered close to singh joined the call for him to step down even 
before the vote

hundreds of demonstrators blocked 
streets and train tracks today halting most traffic in the capital 
to press their demands for president hussain muhammad ershad to 
resign 
stores and offices closed apparently out of fear of attacks 
when what was intended to be a blockade of transport turned into a 
general strike 
groups of about 50 demonstrators staged sitdown strikes at 
about two dozen rail and road intersections in and around dhaka a 
city of 7 million people 
many people walked to work even bicyclepowered rickshaws 
dhakas chief mode of transport stayed off the streets 
protesters paraded through the streets shouting down with 
ershad and days of autocracy are over 
united news of bangladesh said 4000 police and paramilitary 
troops were deployed in dhaka there were no reports of violence by 
midday 
the blockade was the latest tactic in the campaign by opposition 
parties to force ershad to quit at least eight people have been 
killed by police since the current round of protests started oct 
10 
we are happy to see that the blockade has turned into a hartal 
general strike this shows popular support for our cause said 
suranjit sengupta a top leader of the democratic party it is one 
of eight parties in an alliance headed by the awami league led by 
sheik hasina one of the countrys main opposition politicians 
ershad has dismissed the campaign against him as the work of a 
handful of violencemongers who are out to destabilize 
bangladesh 
he was an army general when he seized power in a bloodless coup 
in 1982 he later resigned from the military and was elected 
president in 1986 in balloting that opposition parties foreign 
diplomats and journalists said was rigged 
he plans to seek another fiveyear term in elections scheduled 
for next year the opposition parties say they will boycott the 
vote unless ershad resigns and hands over power to a caretaker 
government

guard spokesman in new york 
workers apparently halted the leak this morning but not before 
more than 160000 gallons of kerosene had spilled he said the 
coast guard pollution response team was at the scene he said 
the barges new york citybased owner hygrade operators had 
hired a private company to help the cleanup he said work boats 
vacuum trucks and about 3000 feet of containment boom were brought 
to the scene 
the barge was heading north to rensselaer ny when it ran 
aground falk said while the cause of the grounding had not been

wake up america ken kesey has 
assembled a bunch of the old merry pranksters for a crosscountry 
trip to deliver his psychedelic bus to the smithsonian institution 
but heres keseys latest prank when he gets there he might not 
really give them the bus 
they did ask for the bus a long time ago said kesey 
sitting at his kitchen table in his red long underwear after taking 
the bus for a spin past his neighbors farms this was going to 
be a swan song but suddenly the swan is up and dancing and doing 
rap 
theres a dilemma with that smithsonian thing its like the 
song by the who you want it you want it you caaaaaaant have 
it 
now 55 kesey was a young literary lion roaring with success 
from his novels one flew over the cuckoos nest and sometimes 
a great notion when he bought the bus to take a bunch of friends 
to the 1964 worlds fair in new york 
along the way the pranksters became heroes of the freelove 
acidrock turnon tunein dropout 1960s largely through tom 
wolfes book the electric koolaid acid test 
ed mcclanahan a writer pal of keseys who missed the first 
trip but is coming along to chronicle the current one figures 
the bus inspired the whos magic bus song the one with the 
lyrics i want it i want it i want it you caaaaaaant have 
it and the beatles magical mystery tour movie 
that trip was a seminal moment in american culture 
mcclanahan said 
the painted psychedelic swirls that made the bus a cultural icon 
originally were applied to keep it from looking like a school bus 
said keseys wife faye 
over the next 25 years the designs mutated and evolved into a 
mural that embodies keseys vision of the bus as a rallying symbol 
for saving the earth 
on the right side is michelangelos adam from the ceiling of the 
sistine chapel dorothy tin man scarecrow and cowardly lion skip 
up to the emerald city where a northern spotted owl is perched on 
the left is a totem pole fish swim on the flanks the hood 
ornament is a bronze jester 
over the windshield is its name further worn like a crown to 
proclaim the bus destination 
the idea for this trip grew out of keseys latest book the 
further inquiry the book originally was conceived as a play 
staged on the bus where the soul of neal cassady is put on trial 
cassady was the basis for the hero of beat writer jack kerouacs 
on the road as well as the charismatic man behind the wheel of 
further on that first trip he laid down a freeassociation 
rapbabble that still makes kesey shake his head in wonder and joy 
when he watches old home movies 
kesey wanted the book to include a movie of cassady printed one 
frame to a page so that they moved as the pages were flipped 
its important to see how he jabbers and jumps kesey said 
his publisher viking agreed to include the flip pictures if 
kesey would drive further to a book fair in las vegas 
he had so much fun that he planned a crosscountry trip to ease 
further into its grave at the smithsonian and promote his new book 
the latest trip wont be as wild as the others 
were grandparents now kesey said 
he is scheduled to take further to a book signing in portland on 
sunday on monday he heads south to california hoping to reach 
berkeley by halloween to help counterculture pal wavy gravy collect 
for unicef and campaign for city council after that the schedule 
gets dim though kesey hopes to pick up lsd guru timothy leary and 
gonzo journalist hunter s thompson along the way 
but getting back on the road has given kesey second thoughts 
about turning over the bus to the smithsonian 
this is why i would hate to see it laminated and stopped 
kesey said it was just going good again

prime minister mike moore 
conceded defeat today as the conservative national party appeared 
headed for a landslide victory in parliamentary elections ending 
six years of labor rule 
national party leader jim bolger who seeks better relations 
with the united states was expected to assume a threeyear term as 
the countrys new prime minister 
moore whose centerleft party suffered from a faltering 
economy phoned bolger less than 2 hours after the polls closed 
i wish you well he told a beaming bolger the 54yearold 
son of irish immigrant farmers you worked hard for it 
final unofficial results indicated national was likely to win 
68 seats in the 97member parliament to 28 for labor and one for 
new labor a handful of seats were close enough that they still 
could be decided by absentee ballots sveral cabinet ministers 
were among the labor casualties 
national polled 49 percent of the vote to 35 percent for labor 
the green party a relatively new political group that as part of 
its policy has no official leader was third with 7 percent with 5 
percent for new labor 
of the 2158966 registered voters 1636184 76 percent 
cast ballots 
labor had a 5640 majority in the outgoing parliament the new 
labor party held the remaining seat 
both the nationals and labor pledge to continue barring 
nuclearpowered ships and ships with nuclear weapons from making 
port calls a policy that has angered us officials 
but the national party seeks some sort of reconciliation with 
washington and bolger was welcomed in the us capital at a time 
when other top new zealand officials were not 
moore took over as prime minister two months ago when geoffrey 
palmer resigned with polls indicating labor trailing by 21 points 
and heading for a landslide loss 
moore 41 made a desperate lastminute bid friday for support 
from environmentalists 
in a country where pride in the environment runs high moore 
said any vote for the small green party actually would be a vote 
for the nationals whom he tried to paint as anticonservationist 
greens backers come primarily from labors traditional base 
moore had held out hope for an upset because the final polls 
indicated nearly a quarter of the electorate undecided just days 
before the election 
before palmer resigned moores backers were predicting labor 
would retain only 15 of its seats in parliament 
moore the former external affairs and trade minister worked 
hard to eat away at the governments budget deficit he 
consistently ranked well above bolger when voters were asked who 
they favored for prime minister 
but labor was dragged down by a sagging economy and its 
unpopular privatization efforts which national branded as 
selling off the state silver to pay the bills 
unemployment is running at 79 percent the highest level since 
world war ii and topped voter concerns in this south pacific 
island nation of 35 million people 
the countrys policy against nuclear vessels and weapons 
initiated in 1984 under labor prime minister david lange kept us 
warships from making port calls because the pentagon refuses to 
divulge whether any are carrying nuclear weapons 
in response to the policy the united states in 1986 cut 
highlevel contacts with new zealand and dropped the country from 
the anzus military alliance which also includes australia

palestinians in the occupied territories may be 
allowed to reenter israel as soon as sunday but will face tougher 
security measures israeli army chief of staff said today 
more than 17 million palestinians in the west bank and the gaza 
strip have been confined to the territories since wednesday 
following a wave of arabjewish street violence 
the chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said the situation in 
the occupied areas and within israel now appeared quiet 
if it continues to be quiet we will open the territory 
soon maybe even on sunday he told israel radio 
israeli government officials say the final decision is expected 
saturday night 
the closure cut off about 110000 to 150000 palestinians among 
them laborers who have no work permits from jobs in israel when 
they return they will be met with stricter security steps shomron 
said 
we will ask the employers in a much more serious manner not 
to employ unlicensed workers in order to safeguard themselves and 
others they too are responsible for preventing terror attacks 
he said 
in addition the number of palestinians banned from traveling to 
israel for security or criminal offenses now several thousand 
people will be increased shomron added 
the upsurge in the 34monthold palestinian uprising shomron 
said is linked to the oct 8 shooting on temple mount in 
jerusalem where israeli police killed 20 arab rioters and wounded 
140 five people have been killed and 11 wounded in subsequent 
arabjewish street violence 
there are situations as it happened after the temple mount 
in which an unusually large part of the population participates in 
the events a small part had also acted individually carrying out 
revenge attacks shomron said 
israel also expects an increase in crossborder guerrilla raids 
following the temple mount shootings he said 
it is known that following the temple mount there is a 
greater motivation to act against israel to attack it from the 
borders and not only within the territories or the green line 
shomron said in reference to israels pre1967 borders we have 
no doubt that we can expect repeated attack attempts 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
these lands are the scene of the palestinian revolt in which at 
least 766 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or 
civilians some 289 arabs have been slain by fellow palestinians as 
alleged proisraeli collaborators fiftyone israelis also have 
died

mikhail gorbachev hinted today the iraqi 
leadership might be softening its hardline position on the persian 
gulf crisis and reiterated that military force should not be used 
to end the conflict 
the soviet president said indications from iraq that its 
position might be changing will be clarified in coming days but he 
did not elaborate 
gorbachev spoke at a joint news conference with prime minister 
felipe gonzalez on the second day of a threeday visit to spain 
the first to this country by a soviet head of state 
emphasis on the crisis which began with iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait was expected to continue sunday evening when gorbachev 
travels to paris for a 24hour visit that includes talks with 
french president francois mitterrand 
in the news conference gorbachev ruled out using military force 
against iraqi president saddam hussein he cited the suffering such 
action would cause the iraqi people and the 3000 soviet 
specialists remaining in iraq 
until the very end we must take advantage of everything 
within our reach to find a peaceful solution to this problem 
gorbachev said 
the soviet leaders personal envoy yevgeny primakov is 
scheduled to go to baghdad on sunday for the second time in a 
month 
gorbachev also said there were indications there might be 
changes in the hardline position within the iraqi leadership 
toward the gulf crisis 
in recent days there are signals that in the iraqi leadership 
there is an understanding that solution of problems cannot be 
achieved through ultimatums gorbachev said in russian translated 
into spanish i may be mistaken and the coming days maybe will 
bring some clarification 
the private french television station la cinq said friday that 
saddam had sent letters to both mitterrand and gorbachev expressing 
his readiness to discuss middle east problems including kuwait 
french officials denied knowledge of any letters

voters returned to the polls today to 
elect four provincial legislatures a test of the rightwing 
alliance that defeated benazir bhutto officials reported at least 
25 deaths in clashes between rival parties 
the provincial elections came three days after the islamic 
democratic alliance defeated ms bhuttos populist pakistan 
peoples party by more than a 2to1 margin that denied her a 
second chance to lead this predominantly moslem country of 110 
million people 
the 37yearold former prime minister accused the armybacked 
caretaker government of largescale vote rigging a charge that a 
team of international poll watchers rejected 
despite unprecedented security officials said at least 25 
people were killed and as many as 100 injured in clashes between 
rival parties officials said most of the casualties occurred in 
eastern punjab province a longtime stronghold of ms bhuttos 
opponents 
election officials said turnout today among pakistans 50 
million eligible voters was moderate to very light and many 
polling stations were empty they reported heavy turnout in several 
constituencies in karachi ms bhuttos hometown 
first results from the election were not expected before noon 
edt 
the legislatures of punjab sindh baluchistan and northwest 
frontier provinces were disbanded aug 6 just hours after ms 
bhuttos 20monthold government was dismissed on charges of 
corruption and incompetence 
more than 3700 candidates are vying for 483 seats in the four 
assemblies ms bhuttos party contested the election despite calls 
by some loyalists to boycott 
the islamic democratic alliance is expected to sweep the 
248member assembly in eastern punjab the countrys wealthiest and 
most populous province and a longtime stronghold 
the stakes were highest for ms bhutto in sindh her home 
province and political power base analysts say winning a majority 
in the 109member assembly was ms bhuttos only hope of 
maintaining any power 
sindh and its capital karachi have been wracked by ethnic 
violence that has claimed nearly 3000 lives in the past five 
years ms bhuttos inability to stop the relentless bloodshed was 
one of the reasons cited by president ghulam ishaq khan for 
dismissing her government 
about 100000 soldiers paramilitary troops and police have been 
patrolling the countrys most volatile areas during this weeks 
balloting more than half have been deployed across sindh 
at least nine people were killed and more than 60 others injured

government and her opponents of widespread vote tampering alleging 
ballot boxes were switched party workers killed and election 
officials attacked by armed gangs 
but a 40member observer team from the washingtonbased national 
democratic institute said friday its preliminary findings showed no 
evidence to support the contentions by ms bhutto who plans to 
challenge the figures in court 
sartaj aziz finance minister in the caretaker government said 
friday he hoped the observer teams observations would convince 
washington to reinstitute 573 million aid package 
washington suspended economic and military aid on oct 1 
demanding greater assurances from islamabad that pakistan neither 
possesses or wants to possess nuclear weapons

the california gubernatorial campaign 
is rushing into its final days on a tide of negative advertising 
as democrat dianne feinstein and republican sen pete wilson jockey 
for the lead in the neckandneck race 
feinstein is lashing out at wilsons record in congress while 
wilson blasts feinstein for negative campaigning in her attempt to 
succeed retiring gov george deukmejian 
a new feinstein ad describes how wilson was wheeled into the 
senate on a gurney after a 1985 emergency appendectomy to cast the 
deciding vote to freeze social security benefits 
the audio portion of the ad has senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan quipping that wilson votes better under sedation 
wilson calls the ad the ugliest and most meanspirited 
commercial of 1990 his campaign describes it as a sign of 
desperation by feinstein 
wilsons commercials meanwhile feature segments of earlier 
feinstein commercials accompanied by news stories describing them 
as fraudulent and dirty 
the los angeles times poll reported feinstein ahead by 41 
percent to 39 percent in september and wilson overtaking her for a 
4241 lead in early october 
mervin fields california poll reports a 4742 wilson lead 
compared with 4542 in september while pollster steve teichner 
found a 3730 wilson lead in midoctober compared with 3735 in 
early october 
president bush was in california last week to campaign for 
wilson but wilson was in washington as congress put the finishing 
touches on the budgetdeficit reduction package 
wilson who won reelection to the senate in 1988 had been 
harshly criticized by some for campaigning at home while congress 
had unfinished business 
there have been no major issues in the campaign to clearly 
differentiate the candidates 
as a result issues such as wilsons attendance record in the 
senate and feinsteins endorsement four years ago of controversial 
former state chief justice rose bird have taken on significance in 
the campaign 
both candidatss have tried to portray themselves as political 
outsiders despite wilsons 24 years as a state legislator mayor 
and us senator and feinsteins 20 years as san francisco 
supervisor and mayor 
its been a campaign of limited candidate appearances and few 
major speeches but endless television commercials and faxed press 
releases magnifying small differences and manufacturing other 
differences where none exist 
theyve battled inconclusively over who is most opposed to 
hiring quotas most supportive of law enforcement and the death 
penalty most dedicated to abortion rights and most concerned about 
the environment 
wilson and feinstein say raising taxes would be a last resort 
but both have refused to take a nonewtaxes pledge which is a 
significant acknowledgement of the dire fiscal problem the next 
governor faces 
they do disagree on which taxes they might raise with wilson 
leaning to a sales tax increase and feinstein to a higher top 
income tax bracket 
polls report that the historic significance of feinsteins bid 
to become the states first woman governor has faded as a campaign 
factor as voters have sorted themselves out more along traditional 
party lines 
this race has reshaped itself not into one about history 
whether to elect a woman governor but in rather traditional 
terms liberals vs conservatives and a battle for the 
middleoftheroad voters said pollster teichner 
historically when elections break down to this level 
republicans win he said 
wilsons narrow lead appears to be based more on voters second 
thoughts about feinstein than positive support for wilson 
im not sure this was ever wilsons to win said teichner 
its hers to lose its her vote that has been the volatile 
vote

the supreme court wrestles with abortion once 
again this time considering whether patients at federally funded 
family planning clinics can be told that they have the option of 
ending unwanted pregnancies 
the arguments scheduled for tuesday center on freespeech 
issues and not the legality of abortion but the hearing still may 
give the first glimpses of justice david souters stance on 
abortion 
at stake is the information available to the 5 million 
lowincome women who depend on federally funded clinics and similar 
healthcare providers 
if any of these women faces an unwanted pregnancy she has the 
same three options confronting wealthier women raise the child 
place the child for adoption or abortion 
but if the bush administration wins in the supreme court 
doctors and counselors at some 4000 federally financed family 
planning clinics will be barred from discussing the third option 
with their clients 
federal regulations adopted by the reagan administration in 1988 
imposed the ban on counseling about abortion but court challenges 
have kept the regulations from being enforced virtually everywhere 
last year family planning clinics received more than 140 
million in federal money 
a federal appeals court in new york upheld the ban but other 
federal courts have ruled it an unconstitutional infringement of 
freespeech rights after hearing arguments in the new york case 
tuesday the supreme court is expected to resolve the conflicting 
rulings by july 
souter joined the court earlier this month succeeding justice 
william brennan during confirmation hearings he declined to state 
whether he would vote to overturn roe vs wade the 1973 ruling 
that legalized most abortions tuesdays arguments will be the 
first for souter on abortion since he joined the federal bench 
the high court is not the sole battlefield legislation to sweep 
away the counseling ban was introduced in congress last week and 
is expected to be reintroduced when the new congress convenes in 
january 
i dont think this is so much a prochoice or prolife 
question said rep john porter rill a sponsor of a house 
bill to lift the ban its really a matter whether people should 
be told the whole truth 
sen john chafee rri who sponsored a similar bill in the 
senate said nobodys arguing that any taxpayer money can be 
spent for abortions its a question of counseling of providing 
full information 
the family planning program enacted by congress as title x of 
the public health service act pays for creating and operating the 
clinics for most clinics federal money accounts for only a 
portion perhaps 10 percent of their budgets 
the clinics always have been barred from using federal money to 
perform abortions but regulations originally let the clinic staffs 
tell women about the abortion option and make referrals 
after those regulations drew criticism from antiabortion 
groups the reagan administration said the clinics may not 
encourage promote or advocate abortion as a method of family 
planning or distribute written materials on abortion 
under the 1988 regulations a woman who visited a federally 
funded family planning clinic and asked about abortion would have 
to be told that the clinic staff does not consider abortion an 
appropriate method of family planning counselors or doctors then 
could offer help in obtaining prenatal care 
the government wants to abuse the counselorpatient 
relationship said rachael pine a lawyer representing planned 
parethood and others who attacked the 1988 regulations they are 
taking unfair advantage in the marketplace of ideas 
but lawyer john w whitehead who on behalf of the rutherford 
institute urged the justices to uphold the 1988 regulations said 
they do not restrict speech unless it is financially supported by 
the use of federal funds 
the correct question whitehead said is whether title x 
projects may utilize federal funds to financially support abortion 
speech through abortion advocacy and counseling he said the 
answer should be no 
although the regulations were fueled by the politics of 
abortion the supreme court case is more about freedom of speech 
those attacking regulations say they interfere impermissibly 
with the rights of clinic staffs and patients by imposing a kind of 
viewpoint discrimination 
but the bush administration and others say the government when 
spending taxpayer money may choose to favor some types of speech 
over others 
a similar debate is being aired over antiobscenity curbs on the 
federally subsidized national endowment for the arts

the interamerican development bank said 
saturday that latin america must continue freemarket economic 
programs advocated by the bush administration if the region is to 
be fully integrated into the global economy 
in its annual social and economic report the development bank 
also said that getting rid of poverty is essential to the future of 
participatory politics in the region 
eliminating poverty is an enormous task the report said 
that will require creative coordination between public and private 
sectors 
the economic commission for latin america the banks sister 
organization estimated in 1989 that 44 percent of the people in 
latin america were poor nearly 183 million people 
the united states has provided 211 billion to the 
washingtonbased bank since it was set up in 1959 in partnership 
with latin american nations the economic commission is a united 
nations think tank for latin america based in santiago chile 
now that all latin american nations have democratically elected 
governments the bush administration has said it is time for them 
to move away from statecontrolled economies with bloated 
bureaucracies that strangle private enterprise 
president bush has suggested that western hemisphere countries 
interested in building up a market economy form a freetrade zone 
next month he plans to visit mexico to formally open negotiations 
and in early december is scheduled to visit brazil chile uruguay 
venezuela and argentina 
the economic transition to free market economies has been 
painful for many latin american nations because it eliminated 
benefits such as subsidies for housing hospitals transportation 
electric power phone services and almost all other major public 
utilities 
welfare policies were based mainly on borrowed money and 
collapsed in 1983 when most latin american countries found they 
were unable to repay credits 
the development bank said the state will continue to be 
called upon to respond to the special need of vulnerable groups 
the issues will be how effectively it can deliver services how 
effectively it can reach intended target populations and how well 
it can work with or complement the activities of the private 
sector to improve productivity 
bush asked treasury secretary nicholas a brady to review past 
policies with latin american countries to facilitate their 
transition to open economies but the debt problems remain the 
world bank estimates foreign debt in the region rose 7 billion to 
434 billion in 1989

poet novelist and playwright james merrill on 
saturday was awarded the national poetry prize from the library of 
congress it was the first time the library had been allowed to 
grant prizes since an uproar over the 1948 winner 
merrill 64 who lives in stonington conn will receive a 
10000 stipend from the new rebekah johnson bobbitt national prize 
for poetry established in memory of former president lyndon b 
johnsons sister 
the bobbitt prize is the only poetry award given by a national 
institution the library said it will be awarded every other year 
to recognize the most distinguished book of american poetry 
published during the preceding two years 
merrill received the prize for the inner room a volume of 
poetry published in 1988 his nine previous poetry books have won 
two national book awards the bollingen prize in poetry and the 
pulitzer prize awarded in 1977 for his divine comedies 
the librarys last poetry prize provoked a furor in congress and 
the press 42 years ago because the recipient was ezra pound who 
made profascist antisemitic radio broadcasts from italy in world 
war ii and subsequently was indicted for treason 
pound an american who spent most of his life in europe was 
being held at st elizabeths hospital a washington dc mental 
institution when a jury of prominent american writers selected him 
for the first 1000 bollingen prize in poetry for his pisan 
cantos in 1948 
as a result of the ensuing controversy congress prohibited the 
library of congress from giving any more prizes or awards the ban 
included not only the bollingen prize which was awarded in later 
years by yale university but the elizabeth sprague coolidge medal 
for chamber music and three prizes endowed by lessing rosewald for 
annual exhibitions of prints 
the charges against pound were dismissed in 1958 and he returned 
to italy where he died in 1972 the ban was lifted in 1988 at the 
request of librarian of congress james h billington 
congress gave the library approval to resume awarding prizes 
in recognition of exceptionally meritorious achievements in the 
life of the mind including works in biography history fiction 
poetry and drama 
the bobbitt prize honors the memory of becky johnson a 
washington graduate student and sister of the late president who 
worked in the librarys cataloging department in the 1930s 
she fell in love with a fellow library worker college student 
op bobbitt after a courtship involving the surreptitious 
exchange of notes on catalog index cards they married and returned 
to texas 
after her death bobbitts son philip said he and his father 
endowed the poetry prize as a memorial to his mother with the 
library of congress as trustee owing to the history of the 
courtship and my mothers love of poetry 
besides writing 10 volumes of poetry merrill has written two 
novels two plays and a book of essays he has taught at bard 
college yale university amherst college and the university of 
wisconsin 
he will give a public reading from the inner room at the 
library of congress on monday evening

the newspapers 700member drivers union called the strike

restive antitax conservatives feeling 
betrayed by president bush have tried without success to get 
jack kemp to quit the cabinet and campaign against any budget 
compromise that boosts tax rates 
a possible 1992 republican challenge to bush was not part of the 
discussion but it clearly is on the minds of many conservatives 
if no one else steps forward said one conservative who 
insisted on anonymity some republican congressman will file in 
new hampshire for the 1992 presidential primary 
hell go up there and say look i know im not going to be 
elected president but if you want to tell george bush you dont 
want your taxes increased vote for me in a place like new 
hampshire hed get a significant vote 
while swiftly rejecting the plea that he bolt the 
administration kemp met with bush and told the president he could 
not campaign for a budget compromise that contained tax increases 
the housing secretary offered to quit the cabinet if the 
president found his position untenable for a member of the 
administration but bush said he wanted kemp to stay on and asked 
him not to go public with his opposition 
even with that admonition kemp has found it difficult to 
restrain his antitax populist views when campaigning for 
republicans across the country 
during one recent appearance in iowa kemp warned against 
letting the gop become a hoover party of austerity sacrifice 
pain raising taxes and trying to satisfy the markets 
as a congressman and as a candidate for the 1988 republican 
presidential nomination kemp was an ardent advocate of lower 
taxes he was a principal sponsor of the 1981 tax cut bill 
other 1988 rivals of bush are less restrained 
former delaware gov pete du pont said he also has been 
approached by people urging him to carry the antitax message to 
the country 
in an interview du pont called the latest budget compromise a 
terrible bill that will retard growth and raise our taxes and it 
wont cut spending a whit and its put an enormous blemish on the 
republican party 
the former twoterm governor dropped out of the race for the 
1988 republican presidential nomination after the new hampshire 
primary 
he said he has been speaking out its just that you guys 
never write it down anymore 
du pont predicted that there will be a substantial debate 
between the members of the republican party and its leadership on 
the tax issue in the upcoming months 
but he rejected the idea that bush would face a challenge to his 
renomination 
i think the president understands the mistakes that have been 
made said du pont i think youll see after this election that 
the president will take those lessons to heart 
i think hes learned from this debate that there are a lot of 
republicans out there who are willing to stand up for the things he 
ran on so i dont think hell get challenged i think hell win 
reelection 
a third 1988 presidential candidate pat robertson has been 
silent on the budget controversy but has made it known that he is 
unhappy with aspects of the bush presidency robertson is regarded 
as likely to consider a conservative challenge to bush 
hardline conservatives like richard viguerie who have always 
opposed bush were apoplectic about the budget compromise 
bushs budget deal was the last straw viguerie said in a 
statement issued late in the week it was the opening volley in a 
civil war that will pit bush and congress against middle america 
and republican against republican 
two presidents in recent history were challenged from within 
their party and both beat back the effort but then lost the general 
election 
gerald ford defeated ronald reagan at the 1976 gop convention 
but then lost to democrat jimmy carter four years later carter 
turned back a challenge from sen edward m kennedy and then was 
defeated in november by reagan

the united auto workers union told chrysler corp 
it is canceling a contract extension under which the automakers 
63000 union members have been working since sept 15 
the move which will become effective at midnight monday unless 
a new temporary extension is agreed to before then raises the 
possibility that the union would call a walkout at the financially 
struggling automaker 
the socalled threeday letter was given to company officials 
friday night said uaw spokesman bob barbee 
this is a notification of a termination of the extension 
barbee said today but it still can be extended on a daytoday 
notice 
he refused to say if the letter increases the likelihood of a 
strike 
meanwhile negotiations continued today mostly in subcommittees 
focusing on specific areas of the contract the union is seeking a 
new threeyear contract to replace the one that expired last month 
on friday uaw president owen bieber and ford chairman harold 
poling signed their new threeyear agreement which is similar to 
one bieber and general motors corp chairman robert stempel signed 
a week ago 
the union is using those contracts as models for the chrysler 
contract but chrysler has said it may not be able to afford the 
socalled pattern agreement 
bieber on friday refused to discuss the progress of talks with 
chrysler 
im here to sign the ford agreement he said 
the council made up of uaw local presidents and bargaining 
committee chairs could be briefed on the status of negotiations 
asked to approve a tentative contract or set strike strategy 
among the main sticking points in the talks is retiree costs 
including pensions and health care 
pension costs were on chrysler chairman lee iacoccas mind 
during a preview friday of a yettobefinished 1 billion chrysler 
technology center in auburn hills north of detroit 
right now im wrestling with the union on a 15billion 
premium over general motors over pensions he said chrysler 
spokesman lee sechler declined to discuss iacoccas remark saying 
the company would not talk about issues pending in the 
negotiations 
chrysler which has about 60000 retirees and about 63000 
active workers has said since talks began in midjuly that its 
retiree costs are higher than gms or fords 
the gm and ford agreements call for among other things 
lumpsum payments to current retirees and surviving spouses a 
method for increasing pension payments for workers who retired 
before oct 1 1979 and increases in the amount future retirees 
will get 
although the uawchrysler contract is far from wrapped up 
events in canada have tempered talk of a strike 
the canadian auto workers union like the uaw sought basically 
the same contract with each of the big three automakers operations 
there the uaw and the caw each negotiated agreements first with gm 
and ford before turning to chrysler in an apparent move to put more 
pressure on the no 3 automaker and its canadian subsidiary to 
agree to the pattern contract 
the caw and chrysler agreed to a pattern contract thursday

ricki bingham never doubted she would have a child but when the 
time finally felt right she was 37 years old and it was too late 
i saw a future in which i was childless and it was 
terrifying said bingham one of thousands of women each year who 
undergo premature menopause 
no one had warned the hyattsville md woman that putting off 
pregnancy could mean forfeiting the experience altogether 
she despaired until discovering a new medical procedure that 
offers postmenopausal women a chance to turn back their biological 
clocks 
bingham who did her homework on infertility became pregnant 14 
weeks ago after undergoing the new procedure in which her husbands 
sperm was mixed with a younger donors egg in this case her 
sisters and placed in the hormonestimulated womb 
ten years ago i would have run out of options said bingham 
40 a contractor with the us energy departmentits a miracle 
that something like this is possible but you also have to 
understand what the negatives are 
the new procedure detailed last week in the new england journal 
of medicine enables women well into their 40s 50s and perhaps 60s 
to bear children 
the woman undergoes a normal pregnancy and delivery but because 
the egg is taken from a donor she is not the genetic parent 
the technology also raises questions about the wisdom of 
deferring childbearing into a womans later years when such risks 
as high blood pressure and premature labor are higher 
infertility specialists arent recommending the new technology 
as a routine alternative to natural conception the procedure costs 
8000 and finding donors who receive an additional 1500 can be 
very difficult 
if i were in front of a group of 31yearold women id 
suggest they seriously think about initiating their attempt at 
conception in the near future said dr benjamin sandler a 
reproductive medicine specialist at mount sinai medical center in 
new york 
this form of therapy is a last chance said sandler whose 
clinic has created 50 postmenopausal pregnancies over the last two 
years for a woman who has lost her reproductive capacity it is 
a way to take a baby home 
but what happens after that baby arrives home do older women 
have the stamina necessary to chase after toddlers will they live 
long enough to see those toddlers grow into adulthood 
you wonder what our children will be like said wendy 
fiering a 42yearold architect who has been trying to get 
pregnant 
im very excited about all the advances the cambridge 
mass resident said but this reproductive experience has made 
me realize that when all is said and done the younger years 
are probably what its designed for 
that is not to say all the women agreed that motherhood 
belongs to a particular age group connie chung and glenn close are 
just two of many women who have pursued over40 pregnancies 
still to manipulate the biological clock is to tamper with one 
of natures absolutes some women said the idea of artificially 
delaying lifes cycles is troubling 
although menopause generally occurs around age 50 the ovaries 
have stopped working in up to 10 percent of women by age 40 and 
for those women the new in vitro technology comes as a blessed 
second chance 
its not about having it all said beth hall who directs 
the northern california chapter of resolve inc a national 
infertility support and information network 
its for those of us that are in that late childbearing age 
range the baby boomers who grew up being able to accomplish what 
we wanted said hall who adopted a baby girl after 
unsuccessfully undergoing fertility treatment 
our mothers were not out there to say look if you choose to 
pursue a career there is risk associated with that said patty 
delaney who had her first child at 34 and began having menopausal 
hot flashes a year later 
id figured i had plenty of time said delaney 47 who 
lives in washington and administers federal aids programs so 
whe i was told i probably would not have another child i had to 
acknowledge the years i could have but chose not to 
though she finds the genetic roulette troubling delaney 
said she might have considered the new in vitro procedure 10 years 
ago but since her early menopause she has been diagnosed with 
hodgkins disease a form of cancer 
weve been the cutting edge generation and its painful 
delaney said its wonderful that women have more choices now we 
have to share them with our sons and daughters we have to tell 
them be advised know that if you choose to postpone pregnancy 
you may face adversity

for those befuddled by latestarting church 
services or football games be reminded america moved back in 
time sunday 
most of the nation changed from daylight saving to standard time 
at 2 am local time shifting an hour of sunlight from evening to 
morning 
for those who remembered to set their clocks back one hour 
before going to bed saturday night that meant an extra hour of 
sleep for a few police officers bartenders and overnight 
telephone operators the switch saddled them with an extra hour of 
nighttime duty 
the time change first tried in 1918 and institutionalized with 
the uniform time act of 1966 is designed to give a little more 
winter light to youngsters waiting for earlymorning school buses 
and farmers rising for their breakofdawn chores 
the time change did not affect a few states that do not observe 
daylight time the uniform time act allows states to exempt 
themselves and hawaii arizona and parts of indiana have opted out 
of the system 
daylight saving time returns on the first sunday of april

thousands of zulus waving 
axes spears and clubs marched through downtown johannesburg on 
saturday to protest alleged police harassment of their inkatha 
freedom party 
inkatha is the peoples party they chanted as they marched 
and occassionally jogged down commissioner street one of 
johannesburgs main thoroughfares 
the street which normally would have been crowded with saturday 
shoppers cleared as the boisterous demonstrators arrived many 
onlookers crowded into the small shops lining the street or huddled 
in doorways as the mass of whooping chanting marchers passed 
the protesters wore red headbands and waved their traditional 
tribal weapons 
they marched to police headquarters where inkatha youth leader 
themba khoza read a pagelong statement to the station commander 
who listened silently on the other side of iron bars 
inkatha members are being harassed by the south african police 
in both the hostels and townships this must stop khoza said 
he suggested the police force was trying to appease certain 
political organizations and is being intimidated by them 
he apparently referred to the african national congress 
inkathas main rival fighting between supporters of inkatha and 
the anc has killed thousands of blacks since 1985 in eastern natal 
province 
the violence spread to black townships around johannesburg in 
august killing about 800 blacks in two months 
the anc has also accused police of bias alleging they have 
supported inkatha in the fighting 
the station commander col db keyter told khoza he would 
forward the petition to law and order minister adriaan vlok keyter 
also told khoza we are not involved in politics whatsoever 
the inkatha statement also complained its members were being 
arrested for carrying their traditional weapons which the marchers 
proudly displayed 
these included pangas or machetes knobkerries wooden sticks 
with a knob at the top sjamboks or whips spears and shields 
there was also at least one shovel in the crowd and an iron bar 
with a softdrink can stuck on the end 
inkathas statement said the police action was hurting chances 
for peace between black factions 
police estimated the crowd at 6000 but observers put the 
figure at 8000 to 10000 it was an unusual show of inkatha force 
in johannesburg an anc stronghold most of inkathas supporters 
are zulus from natal province 
the police presence was light soldiers with automatic weapons 
stood on some street corners but did not interfere and officers 
reported no incidents 
inkatha and the anc both oppose apartheid but differ on tactics 
to fight it in addition to protesting police actions the march 
was a show of support for inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi in 
his rivalry with the anc leadership 
mandela go away sisulu go away the crowd chanted 
referring to anc leaders nelson mandela and walter sisulu 
mandela meanwhile arrived in tokyo on saturday for his first 
visit to japan the visit was part of a world tour to lobby for 
continuing support for the antiapartheid movement 
during his sixday visit the 72yearold deputy president of 
the african national congress is scheduled to address a session of 
japans parliament and meet with prime minister toshiki kaifu and 
other officials

im the one who wont raise your taxes 
george bush told cheering republicans in new orleans on aug 18 
1988 twentysix months later hes blaming democrats for making 
him do it 
and republicans this time are doing little cheering 
completing the abandonment of his combative antitax campaign 
pledges bush now is apparently ready to sign a bipartisan 
deficitreduction package that would raise taxes by nearly 140 
billion over five years 
its the latest step in a long odyssey of mixed signals and 
wavering stands on taxes 
hoping to mop up some of the political damage and quell 
rebellion within the gop ranks bush is trying to promote 
republican unity with less than two weeks to go before the midterm 
elections 
when he accepted his partys nomination bush declared 
the congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no and 
theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again and ill say 
to them read my lips no new taxes 
but his message now as he travels around the country stumping 
for gop candidates seems to be that congress just pushed too hard 
or as its become known around the white house the broccoli 
defense 
you know my feelings on taxes i like taxes just about as much 
as i like broccoli he told a gop fundraiser in stamford conn 
last week he repeats the line often 
im not defending tax increases im saying that the president 
accepted what i call the taxbroccoli requirement that was imposed 
on him in order to get a 500 billion deficitreduction package 
said a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the 
condition of anonymity 
speaking friday in irvine calif bush blamed democratic 
leaders for presiding over an uncontrolled spending binge for 
years and he said ive had to compromise on taxes i 
havent liked that a bit 
some analysts see bushs blaming of democrats for the breaking 
of his campaign promise as a tactic likely to backfire and to 
make him appear even more indecisive 
ronald reagan made deals with democrats all the time 
including deals on new taxes but he never said they made me do 
it he just declared victory for himself said norman ornstein 
a political scientist at the american enterprise institute 
it wasnt just that bush abandoned his campaign pledge it was 
that he did it in such a maladroit fashion ornstein added 
but it wasnt the first time bush after all had pronounced 
reagans call for large tax cuts in the 1980 campaign as voodoo 
economics then became an overnight disciple of reaganomics when 
he joined the ticket 
bushs zigzags on taxes have baffled congressional tax writers 
and some party strategists 
its become unclear just what the president believes said 
thomas mann a political analyst at the brookings institution i 
suppose i dont blame him for going out and trying to remind people 
that the devil made him do it but it seems a little disingenuous 
to attack the democrats after hes just cut a deal with them 
some milestones of bushs twoyear meandering odyssey on taxes 
aug 18 1988 he tells the gop convention and the nation to 
read my lips and reiterates his antitax stand repeatedly 
throughout the campaign and his first year in office 
jan 29 1990 bush sends congress a 123 trillion budget 
that calls for 157 billion in new levies but calls them mostly 
user fees and not new taxes 
may 6 bush summons four top congressional leaders to the 
white house and convenes a budget summit with no 
preconditions 
june 26 budget talks stall and bush trying to get them 
moving again clarifies that no preconditions will mean tax 
revenue increases 
sept 30 bush supports a bipartisan deficitcutting plan that 
includes 134 billion in tax increases over five years but which 
leaves income tax rates on the wealthiest americans at the current 
28 percent 
oct 2 bush makes a television pitch to the nation to drum up 
support for the leadership plan calling economic chaos the 
alternative and urging a suspension of partisan rhetoric 
oct 5 the house overwhelmingly rejects the plan 
oct 6 bush is asked if he would drop his opposition to 
higher income tax rates for the wealthy to get a new plan were 
flexible he says 
oct 9 bush tells a news conference a deal coupling higher 
income taxes for the wealthiest with lower capital gains rates is 
on the table but later he appears to recant under pressure 
from gop leaders sen bob packwood rore says bush agrees 
that we will not go up on the rates no matter what 
oct 10 bush says let congress clear it up when asked 
about his position 
oct 11 the president says he is willing to go to a top tax 
rate of 31 percent on the wealthy if capital gains taxes are cut 
even though i do not believe such a compromise is now possible 
oct 25 bush supports the emerging new bipartisan package 
which raises the top rate to 31 percent without a corresponding cut 
in capital gains rates he then accuses democrats of months of 
demagogic attacks and begins a fourday campaign tour of 
democratbashing

burglaries dropped 73 percent last year while 
motor vehicle thefts rose 114 percent according to a government 
survey of victims that indicated the total number of crimes was 
virtually unchanged from 1988 
the national crime survey released last week by the justice 
department estimated that the number of personal crimes of violence 
and theft against americans dropped 14 percent last year while 
household crimes including burglary and motor vehicle thefts 
increased 19 percent from 1988 
the rates of all types of crime covered by the survey except 
motor vehicle thefts were lower in 1989 than in 1973 when the 
first survey was completed the justice department said 
the rate of personal crimes was 209 percent below the 1973 
level while household crimes were down 22 percent from 17 years 
ago 
motor vehicle thefts were up 05 percent from 1973 a difference 
the survey found was statistically insignificant 
the estimated rate of violent crimes last year is 106 percent 
below the surveys figures for 1973 
the estimates based on interviews with 97000 americans age 12 
and older contrast sharply with the picture of crime trends 
painted in the fbis latest compilation of state and local police 
figures 
the fbis uniform crime index found that violent crime soared 10 
percent during the first half of 1990 with murders increasing 20 
percent in the nations largest cities 
the fbi figures released oct 19 are based on crimes reported 
to authorities while the national crime survey includes crimes that 
victims said they did not report to police 
the 8 percent increase in murders in the fbis crime index 
results from the internecine war that occurs in the drug trade 
there is a lot of that said marvin wolfgang a criminologist at 
the university of pennsylvania 
from his conversations with local police wolfgang said he is 
convinced that drug trafficking has worsened since last year 
particularly in the largest cities where murders went up 20 percent 
during the first half of 1990 
he cited studies conducted in recent years showing that 65 to 70 
percent of people arrested in new york washington and philadelphia 
tested positive for drugs 
during the first half of 1990 new york city had 1077 murders 
240 more than during the same period a year earlier according to 
fbi figures 
there were 253 murders in philadelphia during the period up 
from 205 in the first six months of 1989 
washington which had a record 438 homicides in 1989 had 218 
during the first half of this year just one killing off last 
years sixmonth pace 
so far this year washington has had 381 murders 
the national crime survey which does not include murders found 
that all other violent crimes decreased 08 percent last year from 
1988 
but within that category rapes increased 63 percent and 
robberies were up 42 percent assaults however dropped 21 
percent the survey found 
the fbi report found that rapes increased 10 percent during the 
first half of this year 
wolfgang said the recent surge in rape statistics is explained 
by the greater willingness of people in the last five or 10 years 
to report rape 
studies show that only one in three victims of most crimes go to 
the police wolfgang said but only one in five rape victims 
reports the crime to police he said 
the crime survey showed that burglaries dropped 73 percent 
while other thefts classified as household larcenies rose 64 
percent and motor vehicle thefts increased 114 percent 
the survey estimated there were 1969 million personal crimes 
last year down 14 percent from 1996 million estimated in 1988 
the estimated number of household crimes increased from 158 
million in 1988 to 161 million last year the survey said 
the victimization rate calculated by counting the number of 
crimes per 1000 persons or households was also lower last year 
than it was in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
personal crimes occurred at a rate of 978 per 1000 people last 
year compared to rates ranging from 1163 per 1000 people in 1980 
to 1289 per 1000 in 1975 said the study by the bureau of justice 
statistics

jim bolger a conservative who 
wants to patch up relations with the united states easily won 
election saturday as prime minister with his national party scoring 
a landslide win 
the party capitalized on a faltering economy to end six years of 
labor rule in the south pacific island nation of 35 million 
people 
final unofficial results projected the national party would 
capture 68 seats in the 97member parliament with labor taking 28 
and new labor winning one a handful of seats were close enough 
that they still could be decided by absentee ballots 
the national party won 49 percent of the vote to 35 percent for 
labor the green party a relatively new political group that as 
part of its policy has no official leader was third with 7 
percent to 5 percent for new labor 
voter turnout was 76 percent among the 21 million registered 
voters 
prime minister mike moore who had held the post for only two 
months conceded defeat in a telephone to bolger less than three 
hours after the polls closed 
bolger the 54yearold son of irish immigrants immediately 
spoke of reconciliation 
as far as im concerned from tonight the politics of 
inclusion begins i want to include everyone in the great 
challenges we face because we know there are some awesome 
challenges facing our country he said 
nearly 70 parties nine of them considered major contested the 
nationwide elections 
many carried obscure names like swinging voters outlet withered 
party legalize marijuana and citizens against political parties 
that had no chance of winning anything but attention 
several cabinet ministers were among the labor casualties 
a lot of traditional voters have been alienated said jenny 
kirk one of the labor parliamentarians who lost her seat 
labor had a 5640 majority in the outgoing parliament with new 
labor holding one seat 
the national party which suffered a stinging defeat in 1987 
have dominated opinion polls the last two years the partys 
support has grown as disenchantment with labor set in over high 
unemployment slow growth high interest rates and other economic 
woes 
moore had held out hopes of victory because the final polls 
indicated nearly a quarter of the eligible voters were still 
undecided just days before the election 
moore 41 took over as prime minister when geoffrey palmer 
resigned with polls indicating labor trailing by 21 points and 
heading for a landslide loss 
at the time moores backers were predicting labor would retain 
only 15 of its parliament seats 
moore the former external affairs and trade minister worked 
hard to reverse the poll deficit he consistently ranked well above 
bolger when voters were asked who they favored for prime minister 
but labor was dragged down by a sagging economy and its 
unpopular privatization efforts which national branded as 
selling off the state silver to pay the bills 
topping voter concerns was an unemployment rate at 79 percent 
the highest level since world war ii 
david lange the labor prime minister who spearheaded the 
antinuclear policy that led to an estrangement in ties with 
washington had resigned 15 months ago citing health reasons 
both labor and the national party pledged to continue the policy 
of barring nuclearpowered ships and ships with nuclear weapons 
from making port calls 
but national also seeks some sort of reconciliation with 
washington and bolger was welcomed there at a time when other top 
new zealand officials were rebuffed 
us warships have not made port calls since the policy took 
effect in 1984 because the defense department routinely refuses to 
divulge whether particular ships are carrying nuclear weapons 
in response to the policy the united states in 1986 cut 
highlevel contacts with new zealand and dropped the country from 
the anzus military alliance which also includes australia

a historic rendezvous is expected this week under 
the english channel when french and british construction crews 
link up after three years of drilling the worlds costliest tunnel 
as early as tuesday perhaps a few days later the two teams 
will drive a probe through the last 100 yards of chalk that 
separates them 
after tests to verify the alignment of the separate parts of the 
tunnel fullscale boring operations will resume the workmen are 
expected to greet each other with handshakes within a few weeks 
the 31mile channel tunnel dubbed the chunnel is scheduled 
for completion in mid1993 it actually consists of three tunnels 
two for railway trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between 
them taking into account all three tunnels 80 percent of the 
drilling has been completed 
the first linkup in the service tunnel is being described by 
the french as a mouse hole a bore only two inches in 
diameter 
when the service tunnel is fully connected prime minister 
margaret thatcher of britain and french president francois 
mitterrand are expected to meet each other in the middle 
the two huge japanesedesigned boring machines used by each 
construction team are to be left in perpetuity under the channel 
french officials said it would cost more to extricate them then to 
abandon them 
the first linkup of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for 
mid1991 
the goal of the project is to enable passengers to travel 
between london and paris in about three hours that time is 
comparable to flying if transport to and from airports is included 
and would take half as long as a carferry journey 
the cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of 
94 billion to 167 billion including an extra 197 billion in 
case of unforeseen cost overruns 
eurotunnel plc the anglofrench consortium that is building the 
tunnel announced oct 8 that it has reached an agreement with its 
banks on 35 billion in new credit more than 200 banks are 
involved in the financing 
some of the french construction workers have staged strikes for 
higher pay in recent days including one on saturday which about 
100 men blocked other employees from entering the construction 
area management has not said whether the strikes might delay the 
midtunnel linkup 
the chunnels scheduled debut in june 1993 would come six months 
after the 12nation european community formally drops remaining 
trade barriers becoming a unified marketplace of 320 million 
consumers 
officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in 
the first year of operation although eurotunnel doesnt expect a 
profit until the end of the century 
a study released friday in paris by transportation experts said 
the tunnels completion will aggravate traffic congestion in wide 
area of continental europe some britons have worries of a 
different sort fearing an influx of ills from the continent 
ranging from terrorism to rabid animals 
since construction began in late 1987 there have been seven 
deaths on the british side of the tunnel and two on the french 
side 
five british firms were ordered wednesday to stand trial on 
charges related to the death of a construction worker 
britains health and afety executive is prosecuting the firms 
following investigations into the death of a worker a year ago the 
trial date has not been set

for nearly three years the stainless steel 
legs of the gateway arch rose ever higher along the mississippi 
riverfront 
finally workers put the last section into place on oct 28 
1965 forever silencing jokesters who had predicted the legs of the 
giant croquet wicket would never meet 
twentyfive years and 64 million visitors later the arch is 
considered by many to be st louis crowning glory it has become 
the nationally recognized symbol of the city and civic leaders say 
it was the catalyst for a rejuvenation of a decaying downtown 
its been probably the greatest single thing that has ever 
happened to st louis said arthur wright a public relations man 
who was one of the archs earliest civic supporters 
the 630foot structure is the countrys tallest national 
monument it is the centerpiece of the national park services 
jefferson national expansion memorial built to honor thomas 
jefferson and his 1803 louisiana purchase as well as the citys 
role as the gateway to the west 
the memorial cost 30 million with the arch accounting for 12 
million the federal government paid threefourths and the city the 
rest 
since its opening in 1967 millions of people have ridden to the 
observation room at the top in tram cars that travel slowly up the 
inside of each leg tilting to stay level 
amazed in awe said ed green a recent visitor from buford 
ga i pictured it just to be a concrete monument i had no idea 
you could go up inside of it the view was excellent very 
peaceful 
the rangers who work at the arch have heard it all but lisa 
schober said she never tires of seeing peoples reactions 
its always the same things schober said from kids its 
awesome from older people its i made it im here 
the archs architect the late eero saarinen came up with the 
design while experimenting with pipe cleaners on his living room 
floor its shape in technical terms is a catenary curve 
it is designed to sway 9 inches one way or the other in 150 mph 
winds on windy days when there are gusts up to 35 or 40 mph 
people in the top of the arch can feel it move several inches 
but to most people an inch feels like a foot schober said 
everybody thinks its moving even when its not 
the arch is as closely identified with st louis as the eiffel 
tower is with paris said ed ruesing president of downtown st 
louis inc the citys chamber of commerce 
business leaders say the arch revitalized downtown st louis 
which like other cities had experienced suburban flight during the 
1950s and 1960s 
during the last three decades 50 office buildings have been 
built downtown and more than 75 have been renovated an investment 
of more than 3 billion 
i dont think its an exaggeration to say that the entire 
redevelopment of downtown st louis has progressed from the 
construction of the arch ruesing said real estate investors 
ever since have scrambled to build as close to the arch as 
possible 
the arch has drawn visitors from around the world but as with 
many monuments some folks living in its shadow never get around to 
seeing it 
clarence liebman 66 has lived in st louis most of his life 
but until this month had never visited the arch 
remember the lines were long the first 25 years he said

a nearly 250 billion deficitreduction 
package of tax increases and spending restraints supported by 
president bush and democratic leaders was approved by the house 
early today over the opposition of most republicans 
the 228200 vote sent the bill to the senate which was to 
consider it later in the day the bill was supported by 181 
democrats and 47 republicans 74 democrats and 126 republicans 
opposed it 
the american people have had enough of being told that 
somehow we can confront the deficit and it doesnt involve pain 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said in pleading for supportthe fact is that it does 
and that is what this package is all about 
by doing this we have reduced the debt on each of our kids by 
2000 said rep dan rostenkowski dill 
republicans complained that the plan which includes the second 
biggest tax increase in history was being considered in the middle 
of the night without members even having a chance to read it and 
they said the tax increases would just lead to more spending 
deficit reduction its almost an obscenity to call it that 
because the deficit would continue to rise said rep craig james 
rfla 
for all the bills problems said house republican leader robert 
michel of illinois the american people would rather have 
imperfect progress than perfect paralysis 
president bush attending a summit of pacific leaders in 
honolulu told reporters he was very pleased it passed the 
house 
he said many republican members of the house had 
understandable opposition to many of the individual provisions but 
im very pleased that it passed im hoping it will get by the 
senate 
the new bill the heart of a plan expected to shave 496 billion 
off the federal deficit over the next five years includes higher 
taxes on gasoline tobacco alcoholic beverages and certain luxury 
goods it would reduce spending for medicare by about 44 billion 
curtail farm subsidies and shift a sizable portion of the federal 
tax burden onto the welltodo 
i certainly think we have the votes in the senate to pass 
it said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance 
committee 
the measure which was passed by the house at 7 am near the 
end of a 21hour work day is so voluminous that one copy fills a 
box the size of an apple crate 
senate passage would send the measure to bush who abandoned his 
notaxincrease pledge in the interest of deficit reduction 
disposal of the deficit plan and spending bills to keep the 
government in operation over the next 11 months would clear the way 
for adjournment of congress until january 
congressional leaders continued negotiating with administration 
officials right up to the time the deficit bill was sent to the 
house floor for debate the lingering hangups were not over the tax 
provisions making up the second largest tax increase in history 
but over how deeply to restrain spending on health programs 
the bill would raise the 9cent gasoline tax by 5 cents double 
the tax on beer to 32 cents a sixpack raise taxes on wine and 
liquor and impose a luxury tax a portion of the price of expensive 
cars jewels and furs 
it would raise the top tax rate paid by the wealthiest people 
from 28 percent to 31 percent limit itemized deductions for people 
over the 100000 income level and gradually eliminate personal tax 
exemptions for highincome taxpayers 
the measure would raise taxes by 1372 billion over the next 
five years restraints in medicare medicaid farm subsidies and 
other mandatory spending programs would raise the deficit reduction 
in the bill to about 240 billion adding cuts in discretionary 
spending chiefly for the military and interest savings due to 
less borrowing would raise the total deficit package to 496 
billion 
that is shy of the 500 billion target agreed to early in the 
summer by congressional leaders and the administration the bill 
falls short because the gasoline tax increase was scaled back and 
some unpopular spending cuts were moderated 
the measure is built around a plan worked out by top officials 
during five months of negotiation the first version was killed in 
the house principally because of even larger increases in gasoline 
taxes and costs for medicare beneficiaries 
as congress began the final push toward adjournment 
the house passed 40125 and sent to the senate for final 
action today a major revision of cleanair laws the senate passed 
the measure 8910 and sent it to bush the bill would cost an 
estimated 22 billion a year to reduce smog acid rain and 
industrial pollution 
the senate completed action on a 268 billion defense bill that 
includes a scaling back of some weapons systems the measure now 
goes to president bush for his signature 
negotiators for the house and senate reached a compromise on a 
255 billion foreignaid bill it includes bushs request to 
forgive 67 billion of egypts military debt to the united states 
on a voice vote the house completed congressional action on a 
measure that requires nutrition labels on packaged foods 
while congress neared completion of the massive bill to cut this 
years deficit the treasury department reported that the red ink 
for the 12 months that ended sept 30 totaled 2204 billion up 
437 percent from the previous year 
the administration is predicting this years deficit will total 
a record 254 billion if the deficitreduction package becomes law 
without the tax increases and spending restraints which would 
total about 40 billion this year the deficit would hit almost 
294 billion 
by the end of the next five years the current 31 trillion 
national debt is expected to be 5 trillion

president bush is taking time out from 
crosscountry politicking to meet with leaders of 11 pacific island 
nations worried that their region could become a dumping ground for 
old us chemical weapons 
i think its a good time and i think its about time that an 
american president sat down with the heads of these countries out 
there and tell them that we are as one in our respect for and love 
of the pacific bush said friday night 
todays meeting comes during a twoday stop in hawaii where 
bush lent a hand to republican rep patricia saikis bid to unseat 
democratic sen daniel akaka she stayed in washington as the house 
debated the budget bill but sent a videotape in which she thanked 
bush for stopping the use of the island of kahoolawe as a bombing 
range 
the house passed the deficitreduction package in a 228200 vote 
at 7 am edt 
bush who arose for an early morning swim in the balmy sunshine 
outside his resort hotel in honolulu was asked by reporters for 
reaction to the budget agreement 
im very pleased it passed the house bush said as he shook 
the water out of his tshirt and shorts a small crowd of tourists 
followed as he crossed the beach to the hotel 
he said many republican members of the house had 
understandable opposition to many of the individual provisions but 
im very pleased that it passed im hoping it will get by the 
senate 
bush came to hawaii from a pair of campaign appearances in 
southern california where he verbally bludgeoned the democrats who 
control congress for age oldtaxandspend plicies he also 
accused them of lacking commitment to civil rights 
the agenda at todays pacific summit included discussion of the 
hazards involving destruction of us chemical munitions at 
johnston atoll a usheld ring of islands 825 miles southwest of 
hawaii 
those invited to participate included the leaders of fiji 
nauru papua new guinea the solomon islands tonga western samoa 
the cook islands kiribati the marshall islands micronesia and 
tuvalu 
for months pacific islanders have expressed concern about plans 
to destroy chemical weapons from american military bases in europe 
and asia at a giant new incinerator on johnston atoll 
two navy ships carrying 100000 artillery shells packed with 
nerve agents the armys stockpile from west germany are expected 
to reach the atoll next month 
all us chemical weapons stockpiles outside the mainland are 
stored either on the atoll or in west germany 
the government insists it will neither make johnston atoll a 
permanent toxic wastedisposal site nor maintain chemical weapons 
there but it does intend to destroy the munitions stored there and 
those en route from germany 
us officials have promised to carry out the operation in an 
environmentally sound manner and as safe as humanly possible 
according to a state department fact sheet on the problem 
the united states and the soviet union have agreed to destroy 
such weapons by 1997 
environmental groups oppose the destruction and the south 
pacific forum an organization of regional governments has 
complained the plan could make the region the toxic waste 
disposal center of the world 
the forums chairman prime minister geoffrey a henry of the 
cook islands said the johnston atoll issue would be the top theme 
on the summit agenda 
its of great importance to the people here said bob 
wernet spokesman for rep saiki the hawaii congresswoman supports 
allowing the destruction of the chemicals already en route from 
europe and already stockpiled on the atoll but not allowing any 
stockpiles to be shipped from the mainland as of next year she has 
introduced legislation in congress to that effect 
tests of the incinerator are to end late next year and 
fullscale incineration is expected to begin in 1992 
the island leaders also were expected to press bush to sign the 
south pacific nuclear free zone treaty which would ban the 
testing dumping and storage of nuclear weapons and nuclear waste 
in the region 
before leaving for hawaii bush on friday attempted to distance 
himself from the tax increases his administration negotiated with 
congress for a deficitreduction package he said the legislative 
branch was to blame for the strong medicine americans now have 
to take 
speaking at a luncheon for sen pete wilsons gop gubernatorial 
campaign in los angeles bush also accused congress of trying to 
embarrass him on the civil rights issue 
he vetoed the sweeping antijob discrimination bill passed by 
congress claiming its provisions would force businesses to 
establish minority hiring quotas sponsors strongly denied that 
but they fell one vote short in the senate in an attempt wednesday 
to override the veto 
bush sent congress an alternative bill that civil rights 
advocates said guts their legislation administration officials 
have privately claimed that democrats want to use the veto as an 
election issue 
bush said lawmakers were sitting around up there now they 
could pass it his alternative in 20 minutes if there was a 
genuine interest in civil rights and less interest in trying to 
embarrass the president of the united states

eight years after a volcano scare incited 
fear anger and economic gloom in sierra resorts residents are 
nonchalant about renewed underground lava movement that is 
triggering thousands of tiny earthquakes 
scientists say there is a very small chance of a volcanic 
eruption but most of the quakes are too small to be felt so you 
dont really think about it said pam murphy spokeswoman for 
mammoth mountain ski area 
you can get hit by a car she said you can be in a plane 
crash the chances of those are a lot higher than the chance of 
being killed by an earthquake or a volcano 
people who are frightened left long ago i dont believe its 
a conscious concern of anyone in the community said mammoth 
lakes mayor gordon alper 
the resort towns 4700 permanent residents live in long valley 
a 19milelong 9milewide volcanic crater known as a caldera it 
is located on the east slope of the sierra nevada range 250 miles 
north of los angeles the earths crust is being stretched apart in 
the region allowing molten rock to fill halfmilewide chambers 
under the caldera 
the valley was created 730000 years ago by one of earths most 
powerful eruptions a blast that spewed 600 times more material 
than the may 1980 eruption of mount st helens in washington state 
eruptions somewhat smaller than mount st helens happened 550 
years ago at the inyo craters which span long valleys north rim 
and 650 years ago at the mono craters several miles north of the 
caldera 
despite the current activity the probability of a major 
earthquake or a volcanic eruption in the area is less than 1 
percent each year said david hill the us geological survey 
geophysicist in charge of research at long valley 
mono county sheriff martin strelneck called such estimates a 
scientific guessing game and said area residents rarely discuss 
the latest swarm of earthquakes which started in may 1989 
that lowkey attitude contrasts with feelings of anxiety denial 
and hostility when thousands of quakes some exceeding 6 on the 
richter scale rocked the area from 1979 to 1984 
during that period subterranean molten rock pushed upward 
lifting the calderas floor as a result the geological survey 
issued a notice of potential volcanic hazard for long valley in 
may 1982 
that warning coupled with jarring earthquakes damaged tourism 
and aggravated a recession in the oncebooming real estate market 
the community overreacted murphy said residents accused 
journalists of sensationalizing the possibility of an eruption and 
denounced scientists for scaring people 
initially we thought this was a big ploy for them to get 
funding from congress alper said 
the hazard notice was rescinded in 1984 after the beleaguered 
geological survey changed its warning system and seismic activity 
diminished reducing the possibility of an eruption 
swarms of thousands of small quakes resumed 18 months ago and 
continue to rattle mammoth lakes june lake lee vining and other 
mono county resort towns the temblors most measuring 1 to 3 on 
the richter scale started beneath mammoth mountain in september 
1989 they shifted to the caldera where five to 10 small quakes 
now happen daily 
a quake estimated at 5 to 58 on the richter scale shook the 
region last tuesday tumbling rocks onto yosemite national parks 
roads it was eastern californias largest quake since 1984 but 
wasnt related to volcanic activity that causes the quake swarms 
hill said 
long valleys floor continues to bulge upward as molten rock 
moves inside two or three chambers about four miles under the 
caldera he said the caldera floor rose about 2 feet since 1979 
including 3 inches in the past year 
while long valley is clearly an area thats showing unrest 
large calderas can do these kinds of things over years to decades 
without necessarily erupting hill said 
the floor of a caldera near naples italy rose 9 feet between 
1970 and 1984 but didnt erupt comparable uplift inside a new 
guinea caldera also failed to produce volcanic disaster 
nevertheless hill said eastern sierra residents are addressing 
the volcanic threat by developing or revising emergency plans and 
helping the geological survey prepare a new system to issue a 
warning if an eruption appeared likely

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
hinted saturday that the iraqi leadership might be softening its 
hardline position in the persian gulf crisis 
his remarks were interpreted as a sign that the kremlin has made 
progress in its diplomatic initiatives in the persian gulf they 
came a day before a kremlin envoy was to meet with saddam hussein 
in baghdad 
gorbachev spoke at a news conference with prime minister felipe 
gonzalez on the second day of a threeday visit the first to spain 
by a soviet head of state 
he said there were indications there might be changes in the 
hardline position iraq has taken since it invaded kuwait on aug 
2 
in recent days there have been signals from the iraqi 
leadership that solution of problems cannot be achieved through 
ultimatums gorbachev said i may be mistaken and the coming 
days might bring some clarification 
he did not elaborate on the iraqi signals 
a french tv station however reported friday that saddam had 
sent letters to both french president francois mitterrand and 
gorbachev expressing his readiness to discuss middle east problems 
including kuwait 
the station la cinq quoted saddam as saying he was open to 
all ideas for resolving the gulf crisis french officials denied 
knowledge of any letters 
on friday soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze reported 
a change in iraqs position to his spanish counterpart francisco 
fernandez ordonez shevardnadze said without elaborating that iraq 
is searching for some kind of dialogue according to a spanish 
official 
the emphasis on the crisis was expected to continue sunday 
evening when gorbachev travels to paris for a 24hour visit that 
include talks with mitterrand the trip coincides with saddams 
promised release of the 327 french hostages from iraq and kuwait 
gorbachev discussed the crisis saturday with gonzalez and the 
two issued a joint political declaration calling iraqs invasion 
flagrant violation of the norms of international law 
in the news conference gorbachev ruled out using military force 
against saddam he cited the suffering such action would cause the 
iraqi people and the 3000 soviet specialists remaining in iraq 
until the very end we must take advantage of everything 
within our reach to find a peaceful solution to this problem 
gorbachev said 
his special envoy yevgeny primakov has met with western and 
arab leaders on such a diplomatic mission primakov is to meet with 
saddam on sunday 
the soviet union and the united states in their first major 
cooperation on a regional conflict are leading the antiiraq 
coalition that has produced un security council resolutions 
slapping an economic embargo on baghdad and permitting countries to 
use their warships to enforce it 
on saturday gorbachev said saddam may be trying to break up 
that coalition if so the soviet leader said saddam is suffering 
from deep delusion 
in spain gorbachev is also seeking aid for the ailing soviet 
economy as it switches from a centrally planned system to a market 
system 
gorbachev and gonzalez signed an agreement under which spain 
will extend 15 billion worth of loans to the soviets for purchase 
of spanish food and consumer goods as well as equipment for the 
soviet food textile shoe and clothing industries 
we need these credits and financial resources to make the 
transition to a market less painful for the people gorbachev 
told reporters 
he said countres that help the soviet union get through the 
transition will be rewarded in the future

remainder will be played in lyons france the winner will get 17 
million and the loser will get 13 million 
the seventh game was adjourned friday night when karpov wrote 
down his 44th move and sealed it in an envelope if kasparov had 
not conceded defeat play would have resumed saturday evening 
karpov appeared to have a significant advantage over kasparov 
when the game adjourned because he had an extra pawn and was 
thought to be in a superior position on the board

security police at andrews air force base on 
saturday were still looking for a stick of dynamite unknowingly 
driven off into the maryland countryside during an antiexplosives 
training exercise 
the dynamite missing since thursday evening could easily be 
mistaken for a road flare and is considered extremely 
dangerous said sgt janice firth a spokeswoman at the home base 
for the presidents air force one jet 
she said live dynamite had been planted randomly in vehicles 
near a training site in an exercise for explosivesdetecting dogs 
thursday 
however the canine corps was beaten to the stick by a former 
member of the military who unaware the exercise was going on 
drove off with two sticks of dynamite hidden under the wheel well 
of his datsun pickup truck 
the man who was not identified drove his truck throughout 
prince georges county in suburban maryland before police finally 
tracked him down friday morning firth said 
one stick that apparently fell off as the man was driving away 
was found near the base gate but the other is still missing she 
said 
she said the 8inch by inch cylinder contains pound of 
explosives and could be detonated by a sudden jolt jar or 
drop 
firth said the stick has an orange wrapping labelled ditching 
dynamite 
the spokeswoman said the training area was closely supervised 
and the question of how the man had been able to enter the area and 
drive off with a dynamiteloaded vehicle were being addressed

a jury ordered a millionaire to pay his estranged 
younger brother 12 million for describing him to a prospective 
client as an extortionist who wasnt above fraud 
the dade county circuit court jury ruled friday that jorge mas 
canosa maliciously libeled his brother ricardo mas mas canosa is 
head of the cuban american national foundation a lobby group 
the jury reached its decision after deliberating almost three 
hours it based its decision on two letters mas canosa 51 wrote 
to southern bell the younger mans prospective client 
he reportedly wrote the letters because he was angry that his 
brother quit a job with his construction business to establish a 
competing company 
i feel fantastic mas said i wasnt expecting that amount 
but i think its a great decision 
mas 40 said he spent 100000 in legal fees pursuing the 
3yearold lawsuit against his brother 
the jury decided mas canosa who had a net worth of 91 million 
as of august 1989 should pay his brothers company 300000 in 
compensation and 900000 in punitive damages 
jury foreman kenneth santerre told reporters the jury felt mas 
canosa had no right to use his position as his brothers former 
employer to try to hurt the younger man 
it tore my family apart mas said now i feel ive been 
exonerated 
neither mas canosa nor his attorneys would speak to reporters 
after the decision 
mas had accused his brother of libel and of depriving him of 
contracting work at southern bell 
mas had worked for his brothers company church and tower a 
principal construction contractor fr the phone company until they 
quarreled five years ago 
judge george orr threw out the allegation of deprivation of work 
since southern bell executives had hired ricardo mas even after 
they received the letters

just a handful of votes president bush said 
almost wistfully and republicans could control the senate 
but it would take a full hand five seats to wrest it from the 
democrats and that target is almost certainly beyond gop reach in 
offyear elections that republicans hoped would be at minimum a 
stepping stone for 1992 
that is the more likely year for a congressional shakeup 
despite this election seasons voter wrath at a stumbling 
government and worsening economy the performance has hurt bushs 
standing but hes still not as unpopular as congress in the public 
opinion polls 
for a 1992 game plan to hold up the republicans need to add at 
least a seat or two to their 45 in the senate this year and 
theres at least as good a chance that they will lose seats 
instead 
at this point strategists in both parties expect little net 
change in the party lineups in congress a political aide to bush 
hedges the bet y saying that the white house hopes to defy history 
and beat the pattern in which a presidents party loses house and 
senate seats in offyear congressional elections 
counting that way the administration can claim to have won 
while losing 
limited losses in the house wont make a lot of difference 
given the lopsided majority the democrats hold there both sides 
anticipate democratic gains in the house probably in the range of 
a halfdozen seats the white house party has not gained house 
seats in any offyear elections since the democrats did it in 1934 
but in the senate an offyear gop loss in line with the 
historic pattern of three seats would cripple republican chances of 
converting their minority into a majority and thus gaining a piece 
of the action at the capitol during the bush presidency 
the lineup is now 55 democrats 45 republicans five seats short 
of the tie that would enable vice president dan quayle to vote the 
gop into control 
despite the improbability of it quayle said maybe well be 
lucky enough to pick up five seats and then it would be a 5050 
tie 
it would be my sheer delight to preside over a divided senate 
and to cast tiebreaking vote after tiebreaking vote for the 
programs of president george bush he added during a campaign 
stop thursday in runnemeade nj 
bush brought the subject up later thursday surrounded by the 
congressional republican leadership in the rose garden if we had 
more republicans like everyone who is standing here we wouldnt be 
in this fiscal mess 
republicans held senate majorities for six of ronald reagans 
eight years in the white house gaining control with a surprise 
dozenseat gain when he was elected in 1980 losing it in 1986 
when democrats picked up eight seats in offyear balloting 
this time position is a more realistic republican goal than 
control the nov 6 competition is for 18 senate seats now held by 
republicans 16 held by democrats gop strategists said they were 
out to establish a foundation for gains into the 1990s eight gop 
house members left safe seats to bid for the senate five of them 
against incumbent democrats the other three seeking to succeed 
retiring republicans 
bush was riding recordhigh voter approval ratings while he had 
no coattails in winning the white house his popularity looked like 
a major offyear asset 
but according to the latest gallupnewsweek poll bushs 
approval rate has slipped from 80 percent last january to 48 
percent the lowest rating of his presidency nearly twothirds of 
those polled thought he was losing political influence and 
democrats who had seemed vulnerable early in the year turned out to 
be tough at the end 
in 1992 the democrats will have 20 senate seats to defend 
republicans 14 eleven of the democrats are freshman senators and 
will be up for reelection for the first time there are likely to 
be retirements among senior democrats some with problems like sen 
alan cranstons savings and loan involvement 
but those promising circumstances wont make much difference 
unless republicans gain where history says theyll slip even then 
the 1992 strategy assumes a strong bush ticket with coattails that 
were lacking in the 1988 elections 
while he was winning the white house the democrats were gaining 
a seat in the senate they havent sustained a net loss there in 
any election since 1980

required

dog away he said it would be put to sleep 
im sorry it happened he said it tears me up

the shooting of an opposition 
politician on the eve of the first multiparty elections in soviet 
georgia has created an atmosphere of fear and acrimony in this 
republic 
gia chanturia leader of the national democratic party said he 
was shot friday afternoon as he left a meeting of politicians who 
are boycotting sundays elections 
i was saved by a miracle said chanturia showing a reporter 
and photographer his left arm wrapped in a bloodsoaked bandage 
chanturia accused the powerful leader of the round table 
noncommunist opposition zviad gamsakhurdia of ordering the 
shooting on instructions from communist party bosses 
i dont know exactly who shot me but i know who could have 
done it he said referring to gamsakhurdia he said he believed 
he was shot because someone wants to start a civil war but did 
not elaborate 
gamsakhurdia denied he was responsible for the shooting 
this is a provocation an attempt to sabotage the election 
he said saturday its done by those parties and forces who dont 
want these elections to be held 
his coalition and the communist party are leading contenders to 
win a plurality in sundays election for the 250seat georgian 
supreme soviet legislature the plethora of parties makes it 
unlikely a single group will win a majority 
chanturia is among georgian opposition leaders who are 
boycotting the vote they were elected to the national congress 
earlier this month intending to form a shadow government to 
pressure faster change in the republic 
all parties participating in sundays election including the 
communist party say georgia should leave the soviet union 
the political debate is over the duration of the transition 
period o national independence and the degree of economic and 
political cooperation the republic should maintain with the soviet 
union 
georgias desire for independence became almost a foregone 
conclusion after april 9 1989 when soviet soldiers killed 19 
people in a predawn attack on a proindependence demonstration in 
downtown tbilisi 
on saturday candidates stood atop a bus using bullhorns to 
address crowds on independence square formerly named lenin 
square 
even the communist party has tailored its rhetoric for the 
proindependence mood 
the position of the communist party of georgia is that all the 
republics should be free said vazha gurgenedze the communist 
partys secretary for ideology 
gurgenedze himself a candidate said that even a 
communistdominated legislature would declare independence allow 
the free sale of private land and conclude economic agreements with 
the other 14 soviet republics 
gurgenedze acknowledges his platform might be more radical than 
that of president mikhail s gorbachev who wants all 15 republics 
to sign a new treaty of union and remain in the soviet fold 
we think the communist party will receive a mandate 40 to 60 
percent of the vote i cant really predict he said 
gamsakhurdia predicted that his round table coalition would get 
up to 70 percent of the vote if the elections were fair he 
dismissed a poll released last week showing the communist party 
winning 32 percent of the vote round table 215 and the rest of 
ballots divided among other smaller parties 
i know the man who prepared this poll and he is a kgb 
agent gamsakhurdia said saturday the communists are preparing 
a falsification 
we are receiving signals that they are violating the election 
law they are calling people and frightening them into voting 
communist and the communists are preparing too many ballots he 
said raising the possibility that some will be improperly 
completed 
gamsakhurdia was cheered at an evening rally when he accused 
communist party authorities of failing to tell georgias 3 million 
eligible voters where polls would be located sunday 
gurgenedze the communist party secretary said the elections 
would be fair its new for us in previous elections everything 
was decided beforehand he said 
an american professor specializing in georgian politics victor 
peppard of the university of south florida and tampa said the vote 
marked a milestone in soviet politics because for the first time 
there is an independent election commission 
also for the first time there are independent parties he 
said the formation of new political organizations became possible 
this year after the communist party agreed to give up its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly 
here the opposition already has power largely based on 
gamsakhurdia and his ability to call strikes rally thousands of 
people in the streets and shut down rail lines peppard said

the kremlin ordered troops to moldavia saturday to 
try to prevent ethnic violence between moldavian youths and a 
turkish christian minority demanding independence tass reported 
negotiations continued saturday with the republics gagauz 
minority but no progress was reported the official news agency 
said 
a day earlier the republic declared a state of emergency in 
part of southern moldavia 
the situation is highly tense and fraught with unpredictable 
consequences the national government said in a statement 
reported by tass it said it was sending troops in to increase 
security in the republic 
the kremlin also said the troops were going in at the request of 
the moldavian government and representatives of the gagauz people 
it did not say how many troops were sent 
the gagauz descendants of 19th century turkish immigrants have 
declared sovereignty from moldavia which is itself trying to 
break free of the soviet union 
the unrest was the latest to flare in the soviet unions ethnic 
and nationalist conflicts 
it could further complicate president mikhail s gorbachevs 
effort to hold the country together with a new union treaty and win 
the republics support for his plan to create a market economy 
tass said volunteer brigades of moldavians some armed with 
sticks and metal rods were defying the state of emergency and 
jamming roads leading to the southern moldavian districts of komrat 
and chadyrlunga 
similar groups also were reported on the streets of the capital 
which also sent police to the disputed areas 
earlier reports said some weapons and explosives had been 
confiscated from gagauz separatists no violence was reported 
tass said phone lines to the region were cut 
a tass correspondent in the moldavian capital of kishinev 
alexander tanas said by telephone saturday evening that a band of 
ethnic russians from kishinev also had set out for the area 
they were hoping to help defend the gagauz against moldavians 
but were stopped by authorities and persuaded to turn back he 
said 
the communist party newspaper pravda said friday that the 
republic was on the brink of civil war 
moldavian officials said earlier that the state of emergency 
would be enforced by interior ministry troops under their control 
the kremlins order saturday for additional troops indicated more 
help was needed 
the moldavian legislature imposed the twomonth state of 
emergency friday after buses carrying thousands of moldavians set 
out to try to block voting by the gagauz for a new autonomous

the district of columbia will not have to 
allow the christian knights of the ku klux klan to march along a 
major washington thoroughfare during a rally here sunday a federal 
appeals court ruled saturday 
a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia vacated an order by a lower court judge that 
would have allowed the klan to march along constitution avenue from 
the washington monument grounds to the us capitol said mark 
langer an aide to the courts clerk 
police had said the klan could march along only four blocks of 
the avenue 
us district judge louis f oberdorfer earlier this week had 
ruled in favor of a suit brought by the american civil liberties 
union which claimed the klans constitutional rights were being 
violated by the police limits 
dc officials refused to issue the klan a permit to march along 
constitution avenue saying they could not adequately insure the 
safety of the marchers over such a long route police urged the 
organization to instead travel from the monument grounds to the 
capitol mostly along the grassy mall 
aclu legal director arthur spitzer said he would not comment on 
the appeals court order he said no decision had been made on 
whether to appeal to the supreme court 
the last time the klan attempted to march in washington was on 
the labor day weekend when they were met by several hundred 
counterprotestors who massed along the parade route 
district police had to escort 44 klan members to the capitol 
grounds where they held their rally 
the counterdemonstrators all peoples congress had vowed to try 
to stop sundays march as well 
permits filed by the klan with the national park service and the 
us capitol police indicated that between 50 to 300 of its members 
were expected to participate in sundays events 
officials of the smithsonian museums said they would remain open 
regular hours on sunday but the national gallery of art on the 
east end of the mall near the capitol will be closed 
dc administrator carol b thompson issued an appeal on 
saturday for the public to stay away from the klan activities to 
allow police and other authorities to do their jobs 
effectively

israeli authorities announced they are lifting 
their ban sunday on entry by palestinians from the occupied lands 
but they said there will be new security restrictions 
more than 17 million palestinians in the west bank and the gaza 
strip have been confined to the territories since wednesday 
following a wave of arabjewish street violence that left five 
people dead and 11 injured 
as of tommorrow the arab inhabitants of judea samaria the 
west bank and the gaza district will be permitted to reenter the 
state of israel the defense ministry said in a statement 
saturday 
but it said the right to enter israel will be denied from 
those taking part in hostile activities it did not elaborate 
defense minister moshe arens said arabs might be locked out of 
israel again if violence persists 
this is one of the means designed to bring about the cooling 
of the tempers an understanding among the palestinian population 
that repeated slayings will only worsen the palestinian tragedy 
he said 
the previous restrictions prevented up to 150000 palestinian 
laborers from going to their jobs in israel where they form much 
of the bluecollar work force it was not immediately clear how 
many would be affected by the new restrictions 
at present several thousand palestinians have been banned from 
traveling to israel for security or criminal offenses they carry 
special orange identity cards 
arens has also ordered the strengthening of supervision over 
those going to work in israel and new measures to prevent any 
illegal stay in israel the ministry said 
thousands of palestinian laborers employed in israel have no 
work permits the majority of palestinian workers even those who 
have the licenses are required to return home for the night 
unless they have another permit allowing them to stay 
but hundreds of them notably in the tel aviv area violate the 
regulations to spend the night near their workplaces staying at 
rented apartments or in dormitories 
israels army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said 
saturday the authorities will ask the employers in a much more 
serious manner not to employ unlicensed workers in order to 
safeguard themselves and others they too are responsible for 
preventing terror attacks 
the absence of palestinian workers since wednesday has led to an 
increase in work offers for jews employment service officials 
reported 10000 openings last week six times more than normal 
arens decision to lift the closure was immediately criticized 
by some israeli hardliners including members of his own likud 
bloc 
this is a very high risk i dont think its right for a total 
israeli population to expose itself every day to more than 5000 
terrorists murderers who come under the perfectly legitimate 
cover of employment said menachem milson the former military 
governor of the occupied territories 
arens said no one could guarantee israeli safety 
its not a new problem and to speak realistically we will 
face this problem in the future he said on israel television 
the current upsurge in the 34month palestinian uprising broke 
out after the oct 8 shootings on the temple mount in jerusalem 
when israeli police killed 20 palestinian rioters and wounded 140 
others 
an israeli board of inquiry last week found that the police 
fired in selfdefense but criticized commanders for failing to 
anticipate the violence and accused police of firing 
indiscriminately at one point 
israel expects an increase in crossborder guerrilla raids in 
the wake of the temple mount shootings shomron said on israel 
radio 
it is known that following the temple mount events there is 
a greater motivation to act against israel to attack it from the 
borders and not only within the territories or the green line 
shomron said referring to israels pre1967 borders we have no 
doubt that we can expect repeated attack attempts 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war these lands are the scene 
of the palestinian revolt in which at least 766 palestinians have 
been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians 
during the uprising 289 arabs have been slain by fellow 
palestinins as alleged proisraeli collaborators fiftyone 
israelis also have died

a roman catholic bishop 
denounced the ira as followers of satan during a eulogy saturday at 
the funeral of a man forced to drive a bomb into a military 
checkpoint 
they may say they are followers of christ some of them may 
even still engage in the hypocrisy of coming to church but their 
lives and their works proclaim clearly that they follow satan 
said bishop edward daly 
daly spoke at the funeral of patsy gillespie 42 who was forced 
to drive a van loaded with explosives into a military checkpoint 
outside londonderry the explosion wednesday morning killed 
gillespie and five british soldiers 
gillespie was a civilian kitchen assistant in the armys fort 
george camp in londonderry in its claim of responsibility for the 
attack the irish republican army branded him a collaborator 
the predominantly roman catholic ira is seeking to drive the 
british out of northern ireland and unite it with the mainly 
catholic republic of ireland 
gillespies wife kathleen said the familys home had been 
taken over by armed men tuesday night and her husband taken away 
while the rest of the family was held hostage 
the ira used similar tactics in setting off a bomb the same 
morning at a checkpoint in newry one soldier was killed a third 
attack in omagh failed and the driver escaped injury 
at the funeral saturday of the soldier killed in newry the rev 
anthony doran said 21yearold cyril smith died because he had 
helped the driver and then ran back to warn his comrades 
smith gave his life by running back into danger for his 
friends the catholic priest said 
londonderry was a flash point of the troubles that erupted 
in northern ireland in the late 1960s leading to a revival of the 
ira as the selfproclaimed defenders of the catholic minority the 
city remains one of the iras strongholds 
daly for years a stern critic of the ira said the outlawed 
organization had descended a step lower to use peoples lives to 
launch their vile attacks 
everyone is now at risk from these evil people with their foul 
and obscene actions they corrupt everything and every person they 
touch daly said 
we weep for the gillespie family this morning we weep for the 
families of the soldiers who died and we weep for our own city a 
city we all love deeply 
we weep because we have among our citizens men who are capable 
of planning and carrying out and even attempting to justify such 
evil 
gillespie died on his oldest sons birthay his wife and three 
children patrick 18 kieran 16 and jennifer 12 wept at the 
graveside 
among the 60 wreaths was one from the kings regiment which lost 
five soldiers in the attack 
the death toll in northern ireland rose to 63 with the killing 
friday night of tommy casey a member of the iras legal political 
wing sinn fein protestant guerrillas were suspected in the 
killing

israel has had an ugly week 
street violence between arabs and jews left five dead and 11 
injured the government closed the pre1967 borders in an attempt 
to separate the jews of israel from the arabs of the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
for most israelis these are strange and unsettling times arabs 
knifing jews in public jews beating one of the assailants to 
death police rounding up arabs and sending them home 
more than 110000 arabs were cut off from their jobs in israel 
by the sealing of the green line as israelis call the borders 
that existed before the 1967 middle east war 
the border was to reopen sunday although the defense ministry 
said additional measures would be taken to make sure palestinians 
planning violence did not get through it said the border might be 
closed again if violence persisted 
the decision to seal the green line was not a simple one for 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs government the green line vanished 
long ago from israeli maps and road signs according to shamirs 
nationalist doctrine of greater israel it no longer exists 
the roadblocks and long lines of sullen protesting arabs say 
otherwise 
the green line is firm and abiding wrote zeev schiff 
respected military commentator for the newspaper haaretz 
it is as if a wall has gone up said nidal abu yehyah a 
fifthgeneration palestinian grocer in jerusalem 
israeli authorities said the closure was a security measure of 
no political significance 
the closures effect were felt immediately arabs lost wages and 
israel lost its bluecollar work force restaurants were short of 
waiters construction sites were idle streets went unswept 
the latest cycle of violence began oct 8 when israeli police 
fired into a stonethrowing palestinian crowd on the temple mount 
known to arabs as haram essharif government investigators said 20 
palestinians were killed 
it provoked a spate of arab attacks beginning with a 
palestinian who stabbed three israelis to death in a rampage 
through a jewish neighborhood of jerusalem last sunday according 
to police the attacker said he was taking revenge for the temple 
mount killings 
more attacks followed two unarmed women soldiers knifed at a 
crossroad in northern israel two israelis hit on the head with an 
11pound hammer by their arab employee in a workshop 
the soldiers attacker died of brain injuries inflicted by 
civilians who caught him that night shots fired at a car near the 
gaza strip killed an arab occupant 
tel aviv police reported 1700 calls from jews informing on 
arabs who disregarded orders to leave israel the owner of a large 
office block in jerusalem said jewish tenants want him to fire his 
arab cleaners and car park attendants 
at the united nations the security council voted a second 
condemnation of israel over the temple mount killings this time 
for refusing to let it investigate 
israels own commission of inquiry largely supported the 
government version of events it said police were being stoned by 
rioters and fired to defend theselves and the jews worshiping at 
the adjacent western wall 
arabs dismissed the report as a whitewash 
the knife attacks incited by moslem fundamentalist leaflets 
urging the killing of jews have spread fear that the 34month old 
palestinian uprising has entered an ominous new phase 
yossi sarid a dovish member of parliament accused shamir of 
paralyzing the peace process and said if there is no movement 
the blood that is spilled will be on his head 
speaking on israel television sarid added a warning to 
palestinians what is happening now knifemanship instead of 
statesmanship is cutting the ground from under their feet 
soon there will be no moderates in israel if people go out 
of their minds worrying about a child who hasnt come home if the 
fear reaches our doorsteps there will be no more moderates 
jewish and arab doves have welcomed the closure of the green 
line they see it as a step toward weaning the arabs away from 
economic dependence on israel and building a palestinian state 
they agree with amos oz a leading israeli novelist and peace 
activist who wrote friday in the newspaper yedioth ahronoth 
anyone who chooses life over death has to understand that these 
two nations urgently need to separate 
for zionist idealists who believe the jewish state should run on 
jewish labor the border closure is well timed 
unemployment is increasing rising worsened by thousands of 
jobseeking soviet jewish immigrants what could be more sensible 
they ask than giving these jews the arabs jobs 
sarid feels israel has an opportunity to foster a homegrown 
palestinian economy that will set the 17 million arabs of the west 
bank and gaza on the road to statehood 
dr adel samara a west bank economist agrees he says 
palestinians have been demanding independence for 23 years without 
laying the groundwork for it 
i could see in the new ban on workers a positive chance for us 
to use our economic resources and face a new situation without the 
workers income from israel he said in an interview 
zvi elpeleg former military governor of the west bank believes 
there already is a de facto palestinian administration run by 
leaders of the uprising 
this leadership decides when shops will open which palestinian 
police can continue serving the israeli government on what days 
palestinians can sell their produce in israel he said adding 
there are wide areas in which the israeli government is no 
longer relevant

six reputed organized crime figures from miami 
chicago and new york were indicted on charges of laundering illegal 
profits through a commercial bingo parlor and conspiring to torch a 
competing bingo hall 
prosecutors said the six supplied convicted gambler stephen 
paskind who owns bingo world with more than 1 million to launder 
from illinois and florida 
paskind was named as an unindicted coconspirator in the 
14count indictment unsealed friday 
the laundered money came from loansharking gambling robbery 
and interstate transportation of stolen property the indictment 
alleges 
we consider this a very significant case considering the 
people involved said greg bernstein assistant us attorney 
bingo halls for profit are a very easy place to launder money 
indicted were dominic peter large cortina 65 of chicago 
donald john angelini 70 of elmhurst ill sam frank urbana 65 
and izaak martin red silber 78 both of miami angelo gus 
king 64 of west hollywood fla and ettore eddie coco 82 
of new york 
prosecutors would not say why paskind was not indicted but 
florida law enforcement officials have testified he was an 
informant on organized crime there 
bernstein said urbana and cortina were indicted in florida last 
year on federal racketeering charges 
cortina a convicted gambling kingpin was believed by 
authorities to be an organized crime leader in chicago angelini a 
close associate of cortina is serving a federal prison sentence on 
a gambling charge coco is reputed to be a semiretired leader of 
the lucchese crime family in new york 
all six were indicted on charges that include conspiracy hiding 
income from the department of the treasury money laundering and 
interstate travel in aid of racketeering 
federal prosecutors allege that paskind approached cortina 
angelini and urbana in 1986 as financial backers in the 
construction and operation of bingo world urbana and a miami man 
traveled to new york to obtain cocos approval to operate bingo 
world in the state of maryland offering him a share of the 
profits in return the indictment alleges 
in the arson conspiracy case paskind king and angelini 
allegedly met in 1988 with two other men to discuss bingo worlds 
competitor bingo palace paskind allegedly met with king in 
florida in september 1989 to discuss the arson at bingo palace 
paskind allegedly paid 20000 to an arsonist named tommy to 
set a fire at bingo palace on oct 5 1989 a sprinkler system 
halted the spread of the blaze but damage was serious enough to 
prevent the scheduled reopening of the business 
the indictment outlines a series of transactions in which 
illegal profits allegedly were funneled to paskind by some of the 
others and deposited into personal and bingo world accounts in 
florida and maryland in sums under 10000 
the intent was to thwart internal revenue service requirements 
that banks report cash transactions exceeding 10000 authorities 
said 
stephen bronstein a maryland accountant who manages bingo 
world said friday its operators had no comment 
bingo world remains open pending appeal of an anne arundel 
county order shutting it down because of paskinds alleged 
association with organized crime figures

a worldwide gathering of bishops affirming 
celibacy in the priesthood on saturday urged pope john paul ii to 
make it clear that the controversial rule wont be changed 
the pope was quick to take up the invitation he told the 
bishops that although there is a shortage of priests in some parts 
of the world ordaining married men is not the solution 
this isnt a solution to take under consideration and the 
problem needs to be addressed by other means such as help from 
dioceses which have enough priests the pontiff said 
the vatican requires celibacy for priests in latin rite 
churches the church believes that forsaking marriage and sexual 
relations means more time for priestly duties and less opportuity 
for distractions 
exceptions have been made for men who converted to roman 
catholicism after their marriage in addition some eastern rite 
catholic churches permit married men to be priests and that 
practice was left intact in a recent revision of the rites laws 
the monthlong assembly or synod was convened by the pope to 
discuss problems in training priests in the roman catholic church 
which in recent years has seen several scandals involving sex and a 
drop in vocations in developed countries such as the united states 
and in western europe 
at least three bishops at the synod called for changes in the 
celibacy rule but vatican officials said the requirement was not 
up for debate 
some have asked to consider the ordination of viri 
probati john paul said using a latin term for married 
spiritually mature men 
he said media reports suggesting there might be a change in the 
celibacy rule were misleading 
the possibility of a recourse to the viri probati is too 
often evoked in the context of propaganda systematically hostile to 
priestly celibacy such propaganda finds support and complicity in 
some mass media the pope said 
some bishops echoed the popes view 
some candidates for the priesthood think via the mass 
media that there will be a change in the celibacy rule said 
archbishop john foley a us prelate who heads the pontifical 
council on social communication 
we have to be honest to remove every doubt not to give a 
false impression foley said at a briefing for reporters 
following the synods last working session 
in what was seen as an attempt to keep the issue alive during 
the synod a brazilian cardinal revealed in an interview with an 
italian catholic magazine that in the 1980s pope john paul ii had 
approved the ordination of two married men in brazil on condition 
the men abstain from sexual relations with their wives and live in 
separate households 
asked if the bishops recommendation to the pope meant debate 
was closed on celibacy cardinal lucas moreira neves said the 
synods affirmation was a very spontaneous expression of the 
bishops thinking 
there was no lobby to reaffirm celibacy neves said 
the synod also suggested that young men considering the 
priesthood spend a year of reflection either before joining a 
seminary or at some point during seminary studies to explore 
their desire to become a priest 
a lot of young people live in confusion about their faith 
said archbishop jan schotte secretarygeneral of the bishops 
synod the extra time would let candidates learn what it is all 
about 
also recommended was better preparation of seminary instructors 
and continued education for priests 
the practice of holding synods or advisory assemblies on 
specific subjects was taken up following the second vatican council 
of the early 1960s which was marked by liturgial reforms and moves 
toward better relations with other faiths

the partisan makeup of the house for the next 
decade rests largely with voters in a dozen states this year as 
they choose governors and state legislators these voters will be 
picking the power brokers for major redistricting battles 
the arcane redistricting process draws little attention from 
voters but national political parties are pouring millions of 
dollars and advice into state legislative races that often are 
ignored in washington except in years ending in zero 
redistricting occurs once a decade after the census bureau 
completes its decennial head count the population figures are used 
to redistribute us house seats among the 50 states and to redraw 
congressional district lines 
some 19 house seats are expected to shift as a result of the 
1990 census most of them will move from the democraticleaning 
northeast and midwest to the more conservative south and west 
where republicans have enjoyed success in congressional and 
presidential elections but lag behind democrats at the state level 
democrats enter the redistricting process with a decided edge 
and hope gains this year will serve as a springboard to 1992 when 
the party will try again to wrest control of the white house from 
the gop 
republicans for most of the 1980s touted their 1991 plan as 
the means of escaping their nearly 40 years as minority party in 
the house but the gop now finds itself scrambling to defend its 
major redistricting power bases against formidable democratic 
challenges 
already the gop is threatening to press legal challenges to 
partisan plans it expects the democrats to craft 
were in position this year to successfully defend most if not 
all of our redistricting strengths and then peel off a few if not 
more from the republicans said tim dickson executive director 
of the democratic partys redistricting arm project 500 
at stake is nothing less than control of the house through the 
year 2003 even modest democratic gains would cement republicans as 
the minority party for the foreseeable future 
party operatives say new computer analyses that mix census 
demographics with voting records will allow anyone with a monopoly 
on redistricting to fashion nolose districts 
you can slice up a state and preordain the results with 
incredible accuracy said ben ginsberg the republican national 
committees chief counsel 
the republicans hoped for big gains after 17 seats shifted from 
the frost belt to the sun belt after the 1980 census but democrats 
controlled much of the map drawing and ended up with a net gain of 
three seats 
the shifting is called reapportionment the census bureau term 
for deciding how many of the 435 house seats go to each state once 
thats done the states in most cases their legislatures take on 
the task of redistricting literally redrawing the lines of each 
congressional district 
there are 6144 legislative seats up for election in 46 states 
there are no legislative races this year in virginia new jersey 
mississippi and kentucky 
after years of exhaustive research the parties have narrowed 
their targets to a handful to a dozen races in each of the major 
redistricting battlegrounds primarily states that are gaining or 
losing seats 
fourteen of the shifting seats and their accompanying 
electoral votes in presidential elections will be gobbled up by 
california florida and texas 
in those states republicans now control the governors office 
but face stiff challenges this year 
at the legislative level in those states only control of the 
florida senate appears in question democrats enjoy sizeable 
advantages in both chambers of the texas and california 
legislatures and in the florida house 
republicans are mounting an aggressive effort to pick up the 
four seats they need to control the florida senate which would 
give the gop a voice in redistricting should republican gov bob 
martinez lose his reelection bid 
democrats are cautiously optimistic they will retain their edge 
the fight in the state destined to be the biggest redistricting 
loser new york focuses on the state senate where democrats need 
a net gain of four seats to win a monopoly on redistricting 
if that happens what you will see is blatant political 
gerrymandering said the rncs ginsberg 
he wont get an argument from democrats on that point 
the process is inherently political said democratic 
national committee redistricting guru mark bohannon it was 
designed that way to benefit winners 
president bush has visited new york to help the gops state 
senate effort and gov mario cuomo is working hard for the 
democrats new york likely will lose three of its 34 house seats 
democrats also are spending heavily in hopes of gaining 
redistricting monopolies in pennsylvania indiana and michigan 
they hope to capture the senates in pennsylvania and michigan and 
both chambers in indiana where the gop has twoseat majorities in 
the house and senate with the ohio gubernatorial contest leaning 
republican democrats also are targeting the ohio senate where 
they need a gain of three seats to win total control of the state 
legislature 
the party has realistic shots at those goals but faces uphill 
odds in trying to erase slim gop majorities in both chambers of the 
arizona legislature and the colorado house 
democrats find themselves playing defense in the florida senate 
contests as well as in illinois where republicans need to gain two 
seats to capture the senate republicans also are trying to take 
over the lower chambers in pennsylvania and oregon needing a gain 
of three seats in each state 
the pennsylvania michigan illinois and ohio contests are 
particularly important because each of these states is likely to 
lose two congressional seats control over redistricting will 
decide which incumbents get squeezed 
the other likely losers are massachusetts new jersey west 
virginia kentucky iowa louisiana kansas and montana those 
eight states will lose one seat each according to preliminary 
census data 
the redistricting winners are led by california which should 
gain seven seats and see its house delegation grow to 52 floridas 
expected gain of four would bring its house delegation to 23 the 
likely pickup of three seats by texas would swell its 
representation in the house to 30 
together these states would supply 24 percent of house members 
and hold 105 electoral college votes 38 percent of the 270 needed 
to win the white house 
the other gainers expected to pick up one seat each likely 
will be virginia north carolina georgia arizona and washington 
heading into the elections there were just four states idaho 
kansas new hampshire and south dakota in which republicans have 
outright control over state government and none of them are 
considered major redistricting battlegrounds 
democrats on the other hand hold the governors office and 
control both legislative chambers in 15 states and at least two of 
the three seats at the redistricting table in 23 others

nearly three months after the 
conquest of kuwait iraqs armies hold a large numerical edge over 
the multinational force arrayed against it in the saudi desert 
but those numbers may start evening up soon and even now 
commanders and analysts say they believe saddam husseins forces 
are inferior in terms of training weapons and possibly morale 
those could be key factors if war erupts 
the iraqi armed forces are large air chief marshal sir 
patrick hine said last week on the other hand we have many 
advantages 
hine is the joint commander of british forces in the region 
we have total maritime supremacy and the allied air forces are 
more capable overall than saddams and then youve got the high 
quality of american british and other ground forces here its by 
no means all in his favor he said 
defense secretary dick cheney said last week that up to 100000 
us troops could be added to the 220000member american force 
deployed in the gulf region 
us troops make up the bulk of the multinational force of about 
300000 troops they confront an estimated 430000 iraqis in kuwait 
and southern iraq 
in addition to a troopstrength edge iraq has an advantage in 
terms of some weaponry 
iraq overwhelms the allied forces with 5500 main battle tanks 
including about 1000 highquality sovietdesigned t72s an 
estimated 3000 tanks are deployed in kuwait and southern iraq 
including all the t72s 
by the end of october the united states will have deployed 
about 700 m1 abrams tanks to the region it is also transferring 
several hundred advanced m1a1 tanks with 120mm guns from storage in 
germany to replace some of the older m1s 
brtain has sent its 7th armored brigade the desert rats 
with more than 120 challenger tanks and 45 warrior armored fighting 
vehicles 
but the numbers alone dont tell the whole story analysts say 
you cant only compare equipment with equipment said don 
kerr an analyst at londons international institute for strategic 
studies training maintenance and morale are also key factors he 
said 
if it came to battle he said the strategy would be to hold 
the iraqis static in position and let the aircraft and helicopters 
go at the tanks 
theres little question that the allied air strength is superior 
in quality numbers and readiness 
saddam has 500plus combat aircraft including sovietsupplied 
longrange fighterbombers and advanced mig29 interceptors spread 
around an estimated 25 airbases 
among the 700 tactical aircraft ranged against iraq are 430 from 
the us air force including 22 stealth fighterbombers and 38 
longrange bombers 
also the armada of western warships in the region dwarfs iraqs 
small navy 
as for iraqs arsenal of missiles and chemical weapons military 
analysts have said they would appear to have limited military use 
since the missiles have low accuracy and it is doubtful whether 
iraq actually has workable chemical warheads for its missiles 
that leaves only chemical artillery shells and aerial bombing to 
deliver the chemical weapons 
if it comes to war the iraqis could have the advantage of a 
relatively unified command system facing an allied force of units 
from many nations 
but kerr said the us central command headquarters could set 
strategic objectives while giving a certain amount of tactical 
flexibility to individual units from the various nations 
in any combat that erupts iraqis would initially be defending 
kuwait not their own soil that could be a factor in undermining 
morale and willingness to fight he said

stephen w schneider in a 
lettertotheeditor to the dallas morning news suggests that 
officeholders running for reelection should have inc placed 
after their names on the ballot 
inc would stand for incumbent but if voters took it to 
mean incompetent well thats an understandable 
conclusion writes schneider sardonically 
rep bill richardson dnm was home for the weekend taking 
part in a parade at a navajo reservation when someone he figures 
it was a federal employee unhappy about the governments budget 
impasse called out youre playing with our lives 
for the first time richardson said he heard the most 
dispiriting sound a politician can hear he was booed 
its not comforting to be an elected official these days 
said rep jim leach riowa 
americans seem to be growing more and more hostile toward 
government viewing it more as their enemy than their servant 
the evidence is everywhere 
oklahomans getting even voted to bounce legislators out of 
office good bad or indifferent after theyve served 12 years 
similar termlimitation propositions are expected to get heavy 
votes in california and colorado on election day 
on oct 6 the day president bush shut down the government in a 
budget impasse with congress former ku klux klansman david duke 
got 44 percent of the vote in louisiana against threeterm 
democratic sen j bennett johnston 
duke got nearly 60 percent of the white vote even though the 
establishment of both political parties was against him his 
showing has been interpreted as a disgustwithwashington vote 
congressional votes to raise congress pay last spring produced 
an outburst of outrage 
one poll found that 57 percent of the american people dont 
believe the government represents people like them some observers 
contend that suspicion of government can be healthy 
healthy or not its certainly not new 
the founding fathers were suspicious of government and wrote a 
cumbersome system of checks and balances and limited powers into 
the constitution individual presidents have been the targets of 
national scorn even assassins 
but for all the alleged throwtherascalsout sentiment within 
the body politic for all of newspaper reader stephen schneiders 
disgust with officeholders most incumbents get reelected in 
1988 404 of 408 incumbents were returned to the house by the 
voters 
bruce buchanan political scientist at the university of texas 
said voter turnout is a better thermometer of the public mood when 
people are disenchanted with government he said they dont vote 
turnout has been lower in the 20th century than it was in the 19th 
lower in the 1980s and 1990s than in the 1950s 
now only about half the electorate shows up he said 
so something sour is going on government that is supposed to be 
for of and by the people increasingly is looked upon as 
impersonal nosy selfserving bloated wasteful incompetent 
corrupt and unhelpful 
after all two presidents ran on that premise jimmy carter 
promised to change government he would produce a government as 
good as the people ronald reagan would get the government off 
your back 
politicians said buchanan have a responsibility to encourage 
belief in the system running against government he said is 
like eating the seed corn 
buchanan breaks the disenchanted into these groups 
the archie bunker types these are the louisianans who are not 
racists but still voted for david duke they are fed up with a 
government that seems interested in everyone except them they 
regard affirmative action programs as aimed against them 
the cynics an even larger group they regard government as 
increasingly selfserving and irrelevant to them and their lives 
the turnedoff they believe in government but are appalled by 
manipulative political campaigns that consist of contentless 
advertising and preening they listen to gubernatorial candidates 
in texas and california and decide that what they are talking 
about has nothing to do with what the one who wins will have to 
do 
the indifferent young theyre 18 to 24 and all of this is 
utterly irrelevant to them they dont care about politics they 
dont read the paper they are ignorant of the process 
put them all together buchanan said and you have a big 
group who dont vote dont pay attention and who get mad 
john gardner former cabinet member and founder of common cause 
a citizen group that seeks to reform government blames the mix of 
money and politics he thinks america is becoming aware of how 
campaign money is corrupting our political system 
rep mike synar dokla agrees weve got too much money in 
politics he said the individual voters feels his money or 
vote doesnt count 
willard wirtz secretary of labor in the kennedy and johnson 
administrations believes confidence in government has diminished 
for almost 25 years now 
it probably started when people discovered they werent being 
told the truth about the vietnam war wirtz said it developed 
with watergate and the discovery that their president was a crook 
then both carter and reagan seemed to have in very different 
forms a contempt for the processes of government 
constance berry newman who as director of the office of 
personnel management is the chief personnel officer for the 
governments 3 million civilian employees has a few theories of 
her own 
for one thing she said people dont realize what theyre 
getting from the government for their taxes people eat food that 
has been tested by government drive on governmentbuilt roads 
send their kids to governmentoperated schools without a second 
thought she said 
then people blame government when they have a runin with the 
social security bureaucrat or the irs 
second she said we are down to problems in this country that 
can only be resolved by some group giving up something for another 
for a long time we solved problems by putting new money on the 
table it didnt have to be taken from someone else we were 
borrowing it in fact 
now all the problems have to be resolved at the expense of 
something else that brings about resentment people making those 
tradeoffs become the enemy theyre policymakers and elected 
officials theyre government

the united auto workers is threatening chrysler 
corp with a strike at midnight monday unless substantial progress 
is made on a new contract union and company officials said 
saturday 
the warning in a letter the union gave chrysler on friday puts 
the pressure on negotiations that began in midjuly but uaw 
spokesman bob barbee would not say if the letter increases the 
likelihood of a strike 
chrysler is the only one of the big three automakers yet to 
reach a new threeyear agreement with the uaw which represents 
about 63000 active chrysler workers 
the union wants to negotiate a contract with chrysler similar to 
those reached with general motors corp in september and with ford 
motor co earlier this month 
among the major issues between the uaw and chrysler are 
healthcare and retiree benefits the company said it may not be 
able to afford provisions on health care and pensions that are in 
the socalled pattern agreement with gm and ford the union is 
using those contracts as models for the chrysler contract 
chrysler was expected to announce monday a thirdquarter loss 
likely to wipe out 251 million the company earned during the first 
two quarters of this year 
the union letter technically clears the way for a strike against 
chrysler but also gives negotiators who met saturday another 
couple of days to work out a contract 
the union could agree to extend the deadline on a daytoday 
basis could strike or could continue working under an informal 
extension agreement 
clarence cobb a member of uaw local 7 in detroit said it was 
time for a strike against chrysler 
the heat should have been turned up a long time ago he 
said they should have stuck them a long time ago 
local 7 represented workers at a chrysler assembly plant that 
the company shut down in ebruary cobb and more than 2000 other 
laidoff workers are waiting for chrysler to complete construction 
of a new plant so they can return to work 
until then cobb is living on 380 a week in unemployment 
benefits and his wifes salary as a city court worker in detroit 
im living weektoweek id be up a creek if my wife wasnt 
working said cobb who worked for chrysler for 24 years before 
being laid off 
negotiations continued in subcommittees which focus on specific 
areas of a contract in addition uaw president owen bieber and 
chrysler vice president anthony st john have met with key 
negotiators occasionally over the past few days 
after the uaw pattern agreement was ratified with gm workers it 
took just six days for ford and the union to reach agreement talks 
between the union and chrysler are moving slower 
the canadian auto workers union and chrysler canada ltd reached 
an agreement last week that mirrored a pattern contract the union 
had negotiated with gm and ford canadian subsidiaries

an official of the former east german communist 
party said saturday that party chairman gregor gysi was kept in the 
dark about illegal money transfers abroad the adn news agency 
reported 
gysi 42 offered to step down as the partys leadership met in 
an emergency session to discuss the implications of the financial 
scandal but he withdrew the offer after the 95member party board 
gave him a unanimous vote of confidence 
two officials in east germanys former communist party have been 
arrested for allegedly funneling about 70 million in party funds 
out of the country and into accounts in the soviet union 
on saturday karlheinz kaufmann a former communist official 
from the city of halle told adn he transferred the 70 million to 
accounts belonging to a soviet company but he said gysi was not 
aware of the action 
in a speech to the party board gysi confirmed that he had been 
unaware of the transfer he said many party members had signed 
appeals for him to remain as chairman 
the scandal appeared likely to hurt the partys chances in 
national elections for an allgerman parliament on dec 2 it also 
cast doubt on gysis political future 
after last years popular revolt which swept the communists out 
of power the party purged most of its old guard renamed itself 
the party of democratic socialism or pds and elected gysi as 
chairman 
but as successor to the communists the pds has been viewed with 
suspicion by the traditional german political parties 
the partys deputy chairman and treasurer wolfgang pohl and 
its financial director wolfgang langnitschke earlier admitted 
funneling the money to accounts belonging to a soviet company they 
were arrested friday 
a party statement said the two officials acted without the 
knowledge or approval of the party leadership pohl said he was 
trying to protect party funds from being seized by the government 
berlin police raided the party headquarters on oct 19 seeking 
evidence on the illegal money transfers the party said at the time 
that money had been paid to the soviets but only to cover old 
debts and pay for the living expenses of students it was sponsoring 
in moscow 
however gysi went to moscow on thursday and was told that the 
soviet communist party did not request the funds 
kaufmann was quoted by adn as saying that he and pohl 
transferred the money because of the imminent threat of 
expropriation of party funds by the government 
we wanted to keep gysi and modrow clean kaufmann was quoted 
as saying hans modrow was east germanys last communist premier 
and guided the country until its first free elections in march 
both gysi and modrow are among the 24 pds deputies who hold 
temporary seats in german parliament 
when the two germanys united on oct 3 144 former east german 
lawmakers were given seats in the parliament until the december 
elections 
adn said it spoke to kaufmann on saturday in moscow where he 
had been staying for the past few days in connection with the 
multimilliondeal 
according to adn kaufmann told the agency he transferred the 
money to the berlin accounts of the soviet company putnik from 
where the money was moved to putniks accounts in other countries 
among them the netherlands 
putnik also gave pds false receipts that claimed the money went 
into construction work and student fees adn quoted kaufmann as 
saying 
kaufmann told adn his own company in halle putnik and two 
other german firms had been planning to use the money to start a 
trading company kaufmann claimed that two dutch banks also had 
been involved in the project the banks were not identified in the 
adn report 
we wanted to create jobs for many old comrades who are now 
unemployed kaufmann was quoted as saying 
but german television said putnik was a front company 
kaufmann told adn he does not feel he has done anything illegal 
late friday berlin police again searched pds headquarters in an 
attempt to determine if there was evidence of more financial 
iregularities party spokesman hanno harnisch said police took away 
several hundred pounds of documents

the commander of the uss iwo jima said 
saturday that marines aboard his ship have completed drills for a 
landing operation in case of a military showdown to drive iraq from 
kuwait 
we are at a very high state and level of readiness capt 
michael s ohearn told reporters aboard his ship calling in 
bahrain to allow its 1700 marines a break after the exercise 
the iwojima is one of 18 amphibious assault vessels deployed to 
the multinational air sea and naval buildup that followed saddam 
husseins aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
thirtyseven other us navy units are in the persian gulf the 
arabian sea and the red sea as part of operation desert shield 
which involves more than 200000 us military personnel 
ohearn said saddam had developed elaborate defensive 
constructions including minefields but the navy has no reports of 
mines in the waters of the persian gulf he said 
up in kuwait where hes dug in he has put mines there but as 
far as the waters south of kuwait i am not aware that he has put 
any mines there ohearn said 
in any case the iwo jima would not land until minesweepers had 
cleared out such obstacles he said 
the ship carrying 30 marine helicopters and a landing team of 
about 1700 is named for the february 1945 battle in which three 
marine divisions defeated a 20000member japanese force on iwo 
jima island 
the iwo jima was stationed off lebanon in 1983 during a usled 
multinational operation to supervise the israeli withdrawal from 
that country 
i would love to see this worked out in a peaceful fashion 
where we could get saddam hussein out of kuwait and back to his 
borders and do it without the loss of life said ohearn a 
native of manitowoc wis whose family lives in norfolk va 
where the ship is based 
any man who has seen war once wouldnt want to see it again 
he said ohearn was decorated for helicopter gunship missions 
during the vietnam war 
on the other side myself and my crew are ready to fight if 
necessary i definitely think we would give him a very good 
licking he said 
president bush has said he wants to give international trade 
sanctions time to pressure iraq out of kuwait but he has not ruled 
out using military force

the government saturday agreed to cut 
in half a 70 percent gasoline price increase prompting some 
cabbies to lift protest blockades that have caused nationwide 
gridlock 
shortly after the pact between officials and the demonstrators 
was announced on state television taxi drivers moved vehicles that 
blocked one of budapests bridges over the danube river 
but it was not immediately clear whether the 35 percent price 
increase will be supported by all the thousands of protesting 
cabbies and truck drivers whose vehicles have clogged the hungarian 
streets and highways since the initial price hike was announced 
friday 
cabs and trucks were parked across roadways or abandoned in 
their lanes some motorists caught in the traffic jams late friday 
spent the night in their cars but protesters saturday opened some 
roads to border crossings and budapests international airport 
earlier saturday a crowd gathered in front of parliament to 
rally in opposition of the gas price increase 
go home interior minister balazs horvath shouted through a 
bullhorn the government wants order we will keep order we urge 
you to keep order too 
but police did not attemptto break up the roadblocks and at 
least some officials seemed supportive of the protest 
budapest police chief sandor barna said he would obey a lawful 
order to restore order 
but if it is contrary to my conscience i know what i will do 
resign he added 
the blockades followed a government announcement that premium 
gasoline would increase from 59 cents a liter to 1 a liter or 
about 380 a gallon under the 35 percent hike the price per 
gallon would be about 3 
similar hike were planned for other gasoline grades the average 
monthly net income in hungary is around 150 
the government said the price increases were needed because of 
reductions in soviet shipments and higher oil prices following the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the protest represented the most serious sign of discontent with 
the worsening economic situation as hungary tries to move to a more 
capitalist system elections last spring ended four decades of 
oneparty communist rule hungarys more than 20 billion debt is 
the highest per capita in the former soviet bloc meanwhile 
unemployment and a housing crisis continue to grow 
before the smaller price hike was announced late saturday 
austrian czechoslovak and yugoslav border officials reported 
traffic out of hungary was reduced to a trickle the 
hungarianromanian border was closed to vehicle traffic 
in the capital city of budapest and other major cities few cars 
moved except emergency vehicles and food supply vans 
budapests subway was the only public transportation operating 
and all but one of the danube bridges had been blocked the river 
cuts across the capital 
not all truckers participated in the protest state television 
showed some arguing with their colleagues in an attempt to get 
through 
but the mood of the people in budapest and elsewhere appeared to 
back the protesters 
shoppers lining up for bread and milk in anticipation of 
shortages joked with some of the protesting truckers brewing coffee 
over field stoves 
several groups of youths set up picnic tables on one of the 
jammed bridges laden with food and drink 
the air will never be this clean again one of them told 
state television 
in bonn german chancellor helmut kohl said a group of experts 
would travel to hungary on monday to discuss ways of improving 
energy supplies according to a statement released by germanys 
federal press office 
kohl said he will urge the european common market to help 
hungary 
germany will continue to give friendly support to hungary on 
its way to democratic stability and economic improvement kohls 
statement said it gave no details 
hungarys decision last year to let thousands of east germans 
leave the country for the west helped begin the revolution that led 
to the oct 3 unification of the two germanys

in a lastminute turnaround the soviets 
asked the security council on saturday to postpone a vote on 
another condemnation of iraq diplomats said the soviets hope peace 
overtures will develop over the weekend 
the security council members were already seated at their 
circular table documents in hand and ready to vote on the 10th 
antiiraq resolution since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait when 
soviet ambassador yuli vorontsov rushed up to confer with us 
ambassador thomas r pickering 
they met privately with the french british and chinese 
ambassadors and then the soviets requested a suspension of the 
vote until monday as is the case for any of the five permanent 
council members the soviet request was granted without debate 
the postponement is because of the overtures being pursued 
by various top soviet french and iraqi officials this weekend 
said yemeni ambassador abdalla saleh alashtal 
chinese un ambassador li daoyu said the soviets asked for the 
delay to avoid complicating a meeting sunday between iraqi 
president saddam hussein and the top soviet middle east expert 
yevgeny m primakov 
saddam has indicated interest in french president francois 
mitterrands proposal that an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait could 
set the stage for a broad middle east peace settlement 
such a settlement would involve a mideast peace conference that 
could lead to a homeland for the palestinians mitterrand told the 
un general assembly in september 
however the french president said it all depends on iraqs 
unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
in madrid at a news conference saturday with spanish prime 
minister felipe gonzalez soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
suggested the iraqi leadership might be softening its hardline 
position in the persian gulf crisis 
his remarks were interpreted as a sign that the kremlin has made 
progress in its diplomatic initiatives 
a french tv station reported friday that saddam had sent letters 
to both mitterrand and gorbachev expressing his readiness to 
discuss kuwait 
the station la cinq quoted saddam as saying he was open to 
all ideas for resolving the gulf crisis french officials denied 
knowledge of any letters 
gorbachev travels to paris on sunday for talks with mitterrand 
the security council was just moments away from voting saturday 
to hold iraq liable for abusing the human rights of kuwaitis and 
foreign hostages and for economic losses caused by its invasion of 
kuwait 
in nine previous resolutions the council has isolated iraq with 
an economic embargo and permitted un member countries to use 
flotillas of warships in the persian gulf to enforce it 
the council also has demanded that iraq unconditionally withdraw 
from kuwait and release all foreign hostages 
the new resolution invites nations companies and individuals to 
document their damage and losses for the security council although 
it does not establish a system for making claims against baghdad

a corsican separatist group saturday 
claimed responsibility for bombing a kitchenware factory the blast 
caused extensive damage but no injuries police said 
about 10 masked gunmen overpowered the factory director and 
three employees friday night in aubagne near marseille then set 
off the explosives 
the four captives were tied up driven away from the factory 
then released police said 
the kitchenware company is a subsidiary of societe nationale 
corse mediterranee a major operator of ferries between corsica and 
the french mainland 
on saturday a communique was sent to the press claiming 
responsibility for the attack on behalf of the corsican national 
liberation front the front has carried out scores of bombings in 
corsica in recent years as part of its campaign to end french rule 
over the mediterranean island 
but fridays bombing was the first on the mainland claimed by 
the group since a series of attacks on banks and airline offices in 
southern france in march 1986 
the communique said the kitchenware company earned 75 percent of 
its revenues from boats serving corsica without reinvesting 
anything on the island 
it described the societe nationale corse mediterranee as one 
of the instruments that keeps corsica in a state of dependence 
the communique demanded that the company relocate in corsica 
the bombing occurred the day after a visit to corsica by french 
interior minister pierre joxe whose proposal for new 
semiautonomous administration on the island has been rejected by 
separatist leaders

soldiers raided illegal gold mines in 
the amazon jungle and arrested more than 300 people mostly 
foreigners foreign minister reinaldo figueredo said saturday 
most of the illegal miners detained in last weeks raids were 
taken to puerto ayacucho a jungle outpost on the orinoco river 
about 400 miles south of caracas where they were to be tried on 
charges of damaging the environment authorities said 
since last year the federal government has made more than 1000 
arrests in attempting to staunch an invasion of miners crossing the 
unmarked jungle border between brazil and venezuela 
the mining process which uses mercury has been blamed for 
poisoning rivers and for the deaths of several yanomami indians in 
venezuelas isolated largely roadless amazonas territory 
the government is trying to protect the estimated 14000 
yanomami living in venezuela possibly the most isolated and 
largest primitive tribe remaining on earth 
defense minister hector jurado toro said about 800 soldiers were 
involved in the sweep the troops dismantled mining operations and 
detained everyone who did not manage to escape into the jungle he

coast guard crews took advantage of 
favorable weather saturday to contain 164000 gallons of kerosene 
that spilled into the hudson river when a barge ran aground on a 
reef 
the barge carrying about 30000 barrels of kerosene or 126 
million gallons ran aground and sprang a leak friday night about 
one mile south of marlboro and 60 miles north of new york city 
said bill falk a us coast guard spokesman in new york 
the cause of the accident was not immediately clear but high 
winds and choppy seas may have contributed falk said 
the barge hit a known underwater hazard called diamond reef 
which lies about 5 feet below the surface said coast guard chief 
petty officer alan burd barges can di 3 to 9 feet below the water 
when carrying a full load he said 
it was a known hazard and it was marked with a buoy burd 
said 
petty officer howard holmes said strong winds were keeping the 
kerosene along the rivers eastern shore 
the weather is very much in our favor he said were not 
chasing oil all over the river 
an overflight by coast guard helicopters saturday morning 
determined that the kerosene was concentrated at brockway about 2 
miles to the south and had drifted as far south as the newburgh 
bridge another half a mile downstream 
a sheen possibly linked to the spill was reported on the 
rivers surface at a water treatment plant in poughkeepsie five 
miles north of the spill sight said peter doshna regional spill 
coordinator for the state department of environmental conservation 
environmentallysensitive areas were blocked off with 
containment booms soon after the spill holmes said they included 
wappinger creek less than a quarter of a mile from the spill site 
fishkill creek and constitution isle the kerosene usually used as 
a solvent and for fueling lamps and furnaces posed no threat to 
riverside residents falk said 
about two dozen coast guard and contracted workers used 
absorbent pads vacuum trucks and about 3000 feet of containment 
boom in the cleanup effort 
the barges new york citybased owner hygrade operators hired 
a private company to help out no charges had been filed against 
hygrade by saturday holmes said 
aiding in the cleanup was the rapid dissipation rate of the oil 
holmes said 
we expect 30 to 50 percent of the product to evaporate or 
dissipate within the first 24 hours he said in a 48hour 
period we expect 70 to 80 percent to dissipate 
the barge named hygrade 42 was traveling from new york city to 
rensselaer ny

scientists searching for life on mars 
agreed saturday that they must be patient and focus on learning 
more about the environment of the cold dry planet 
if were going to find life on mars its not going to be just 
sitting around in the dust someplace said john d rummel who 
directs life biology research for the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
were going to have to find places on mars that are more 
likely to contain life forms than you would find at random he 
said 
rummel was among two dozen scientists from north america the 
soviet union europe and japan who attended the international 
symposium on the biological exploration of mars at florida state 
university 
three speakers cautioned that it was too soon to conduct direct 
life experiments on mars but rummel said most of the scientists 
agreed the planet should be studied for insights that could lead to 
a discovery of life on the planet 
mars is not considered by many people to be a lifeless 
planet rummel said 
ten years ago the landings on mars during the viking missions 
detected no signs of life on mars the most earthlike planet in 
the solar system 
scientists believe the planet was once more hospitable for the 
evolution of life than it is now conditions grew harsher 
primarily drier and colder 
rummel said some scientists believe that signs of life either 
past or present might be discovered deeper under the surface near 
heat sources where water might be found 
the latest data from mars came from unmanned soviet missions in 
1988 the united states plans to send a spacecraft to orbit mars in 
1992 and the soviets plan a 1994 mission that would land an 
unmanned robotic rover vehicle and balloons to explore the planets 
surface 
on earth scientists are studying volcanoes ocean bottoms 
lakes and rocks in antarctica and siberian permafrost to see what 
kinds of life can survive under martianlike conditions 
e imre friedmann a florida state researcher who organized the 
meeting said theres a good likelihood that life once existed on 
mars 
you cannot really express it numerically you cannot quantify 
it but it is certainly good enough to justify serious effort to 
verify whether or not this is really the case friedmann said

president bush on saturday called on west european 
leaders meeting at a summit to keep iraq from dividing them by 
exploiting their desires to see the release of foreigners held in 
iraq and kuwait 
bush telephoned italian premier giulio andreotti shortly before 
the start of a summit of the 12nation european community the 
first meeting of the leaders since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
bush spoke of the need for solidarity and strong cohesion 
also regarding the hostages said italian spokesman pio 
mastrobuoni 
iraqi president saddam hussein has been making separate offers 
to european countries to release foreigners who are being held as 
human shields at strategic locations in iraq 
mastrobuoni said italy did not want to give saddam any inkling 
there might be a break in solidarity 
we are solid and he is failing said a british official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
german chancellor helmut kohl said western nations wanted the 
hostages released but all of them and not just europeans 
according to spokesman hans klein 
saddam has recently allowed small groups of hostages to leave 
some after visits to baghdad by prominent figures iraqi has said 
it is freeing all french hostages 
french spokesman hubert vedrine said the release of the french 
hostages was decided unilaterally by the iraqis and did not affect 
french solidarity with the antiiraq coalition 
british officials said they expected the summit participants to 
release a statement on the persian gulf but vedrine doubted it 
would differ greatly from previous community statements on the 
issue 
the leaders put off until late evening a discussion of a dispute 
over a proposal in world trade talks for cuts in farm subsidies 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said the communitys 
failure to endorse a plan for crop subsidy cuts was bad for its 
reputation bad for world trade bad for our relations with the 
united states and bad for developing countries 
kohls spokesman said the german leader and bush talked several 
times in recent days about the trade dispute and bush also spoke 
to andreotti on the issue stressing the need for a quick 
agreement 
at issue is a community proposal for 30 percent reductions in 
subsidies for major crops over a 10year period beginning in 1986 
some cuts already have occurred 
the communitys failure in six attempts most recently on 
friday to approve the package has threatened the uruguay round of 
international trade negotiations the talks are an ambitious effort 
to revamp the world trade system 
the farm cuts have run into opposition from germany france and 
ireland which are worried about the impact on millions of their 
farmers 
mrs thatcher has used the dispute to bolster her argument that 
the community is not yet ready to move quickly to a political 
merger and an economic and monetary union of the 12 nations

the death sentence against the indianborn author of the satanic 
verses can never be lifted

news correspondent mike wallace in an interview for sundays 
edition of 60 minutes 
in a separate interview rajeikhorrasani a powerful leader in 
irans parliament said the death sentence cannot be lifted 
because it is a religious fact which remains there forever

under police guard since feb 14 1989 when irans spiritual 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini declared his novel an affront 
to islam and ordered moslems to kill him khomeini died june 3 
1989 
iranian clerics offered a 52million bounty for rushdies

honolulu ap here is the text of president bushs remarks at 
a news conference saturday in honolulu 
president bush let me start with a statement and then be glad 
to take some questions but ive just been informed that the united 
states senate has just passed the housesenate conference report on 
the budget and this completes congressional action on an agreement 
to reduce the federal deficit by over 490 billion over the next 
five years 
this budget blueprint represents corrective action on a pattern 
of federal spending gone out of control we have put on the brakes 
and the process has sometimes been painful but i will sign this 
legislation because for the first time it makes significant and 
longterm cuts in federal spending that should have a positive 
impact on americas economic future 
all political points of view have sacrificed to bring this 
agreement about and needless to say i dont like raising taxes 
and never will but there is a price to divided government and that 
means that i have had to compromise on items that i feel strongly 
about in order to do what i think is best for the country and that 
is to reach an agreement 
at the same time weve cut federal spending programs and 
applied some selfdiscipline a step that also may not be popular 
but the essential ingredient which has produced bipartisan 
agreement is that we must get the deficit down get interest rates 
down and keep america moving and i might add i am told that the 
final enforcement provisions are very very strong so that were 
guarding against more spending out of control spending next year 
and into the future covered by this agreement 
in addition i am pleased that many of my proposals on child 
care are incorporated in this budget reconciliation bill the 
legislation provides tax credits grants and vouchers that puts 
choice in the hands of parents rather than in the hands of 
bureaucrats so im very pleased about the child care provisions 
something ive been fighting for 
i intend to sign the agreement and i will also review closely 
the various appropriations bills to make sure that they conform to 
this new spending agreement weve made the tough decisions and now 
its time to move on 
and i am pleased that the congress also has passed historic 
clean air act amendments which will reduce acid rain urban smog 
and toxic air pollution we proposed this far reaching 
environmental cleanup legislation some 15 months ago with the hope 
that this initiative by the administration would break the logjam 
that had prevented a clean air bill from being passed previously 
this is an important milestone in preserving and protecting 
americas natural resources and i look forward to signing the 
bill 
i want to conclude by thanking everyone involved including the 
bipartisan leadership in congress for their tireless efforts in 
forging and passing the new budget agreement the speaker minority 
leader bob michel the majority leader dick gephardt senator 
mitchell and senator dole have all had to compromise some and they 
stayed with it long long hours trying to hammer out this 
agreement and so i want to take this opportunity to thank them 
ill be glad to take a few questions and then we got to head on 
q mr president you signed onto this budget agreement and your 
your negotiators negotiated with congress including the tax 
increases that you vowed you wouldnt do when you ran for office 
are you prepared now to give it a sound endorsement and urge 
republican candidates to go out and sell it to the voters as well 
president bush no 
q are you going to turn your back on it and blame the democrats 
for the tax increases that you agreed with 
president bush im going to say look ive reluctantly 
signed this there are things in it that if i control both houses 
of congress wouldnt be in it but that and i think the 
democrats will be saying the same thing i notice some of them 
saying yesterday that they felt we ought to have higher income tax 
rates one of the things im glad on is glad about is that weve 
held the line on income tax rates a handful of the wealthiest went 
up and 10 times that many of the upper middle income came down 
some went from 28 to 31 others came down from 33 to 31 there are 
certain things in it that i can strongly advocate there are some 
things in it i had to gag and digest and so thats the approach 
im going to be taking and i expect everyone else will too 
q mr president 
president bush yeah well just go right around the corner 
yeah laurie 
q you say its time to move on do you have any fear or do you 
think expectation that the whole the atmosphere of the last 
couple of weeks is going to haunt you in the election 
president bush no i dont think so at all sometimes the 
president has to make a tough call this is one of them and ill 
be right out on the campaign trail advocating the election of more 
republicans to the congress and we wouldnt have been in this mess 
if we had that 
q mr president how can you go out now and blame democrats 
criticize democrats when in fact they more than republicans helped 
you get this budget package which you supported passed

mikhail gorbachev indicated saturday that iraq may be softening 
its stand on kuwait and the soviets forced the un security 
coucil to delay an antiiraqi vote in a bid to let peace moves 
develop over the weekend 
speaking in madrid spain gorbachev said the coming days might 
bring clarification of a change in iraqs position the soviet 
presidents envoy yevgeny primakov was to meet sunday in baghdad 
with saddam hussein 
in new york as the assembled un security council members 
prepared to demand that iraq pay war reparations soviet ambassador 
yuli vorontsov rushed to the side of his us colleague thomas 
pickering and requested a 48hour delay on the resolution vote 
the delay was granted vorontsov said later that the 
postponement would allow primakovs talks with saddam to take place 
in a less tense atmosphere 
in baghdad french officials announced that most frenchmen held 
by iraq would be allowed to leave sunday iraqi officials granted 
301 french nationals permission to leave but expressed reservations 
about seven others they said 
the officials said negotiations were being held to secure exit 
permits for the seven who are accused by iraqi authorities of 
breaking their contracts and abandoning work at a government guest 
palace under renovation 
vorontsovs intervention came after security council members had 
agreed to adopt a resolution holding iraq liable for war damages 
and economic losses caused by its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
we will have a massive vote in favor the british ambassador 
to the united nations sir david hannay had said earlier but the 
council postponed the vote until monday 
the new resolution would be the councils 10th to condemn iraq 
since saddams forces invaded kuwait in a dispute over oil land 
and money 
it invites nations companies and individuals to document 
damages and losses but does not establish a system for recovering 
the money 
kuwaiti un ambassador mohammad a abulhasan estimated that 
iraq has less than 800 million in assets in the united states 
shortly after the invasion many nations including the united 
states froze both iraqi and kuwaiti assets 
the resolution further demands that iraq stop taking hostages 
and mistreating and oppressing kuwaiti and thirdstate 
nationals 
it invites nations to collect information on abuses of civilians 
contrary to the fourth geneva convention of 1949 the convention 
which iraq signed protects the rights of civilians in wartime or 
in militaryoccupied territory outlawing summary execution 
torture deportations and hostagetaking 
finally the draft resolution says iraq must allow the immediate 
provision of food water and basic services to diplomats and 
foreigners in missions in kuwait city 
after saddam annexed kuwait making it iraqs 19th province he 
ordered the missions moved to baghdad he surrounded them with 
troops and cut off services such as water and electricity the 
us british and french embassies are the last western holdouts 
at least 210000 us troops and another 100000 from other 
nations have been deployed in the gulf against iraqs estimated 
460000 soldiers stationed in southern iraq and kuwait 
but gorbachev reiterated saturday that military might should not 
be used to force iraq from kuwait 
we shouldnt rush in a direction of the conflict that leads to 
military methods of solution gorbachev said at a joint press 
conference in madrid with spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez 
the soviet leader on a threeday visit to spain indicated iraq 
might be softening its hardline position on the gulf crisis 
in recent days there have been signals from the iraqi 
leadership that the solution of problems cannot be achieved 
through ultimatums gorbachev said he added that the coming 
days might bring some clarification 
the french television network la cinq reported friday that 
saddam sent the french and soviet leaders letters offering to 
discuss middle east problems it said saddam told the two leaders 
he was open to all ideas in resolving the gulf crisis 
french officials have denied knowledge of any such letters 
gorbachev travels to paris sunday for a 24hour visit that 
includes talks with french president francois mitterrand the gulf 
crisis was expected to top the agenda 
french officials on saturday received the final goahead from 
iraqi officials for the freedom flight of most french nationals 
held in iraq 
an iraqi airways jumbo jet was to carry the frenchmen home late 
sunday 
besides the seven that iraq has balked at freeing french 
embassy sources in baghdad said 19 citizens had not signed up for 
the departure they said efforts were under way to locate them 
iraq has refused to allow most western men to leave iraq and 
kuwait and many are being held at strategic installations to deter 
a western attack 
iraqs national assembly said tuesday that french citizens would 
be allowed to leave baghdad said the gesture was in appreciation 
for mitterrands statements suggesting that any solution of the 
gulf crisis be linked to a solution of the israelpalestinian 
problem 
western analysts however have interpreted saddams move as an 
effort to divide the world alliance against him 
to guard against such divisions president bush on saturday 
called italian premier giulio andreotti who was playing host to 
the first summit of the 12nation european community since iraqs 
invasion bush asked andreotti and the other leaders to hang 
together in their stand against iraq 
a british official said saddam should not be lulled into 
believing there might be a break in solidarity 
we are solid and he is failing said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity

charges by a federal grand jury in miami 
echeverria has been the last said anez calling the 
extradition a political decision 
he said there is a list of extraditables or suspected drug 
dealers wanted for trial in the united states he did not 
elaborate 
bolivia one of the top coco leafgrowing areas along with peru 
and colombia has a 89yearold general extradition treaty with the 
united states but it does not include drug trafficking among the 
extraditable charges 
president bush and paz zamora agreed to a new treaty in 
washington in may but the document has not been signed 
anez said the new treaty is under discussion but he did not 
give further details 
us officials have praised increased coca leaf eradication 
efforts in bolivia where cocaine production has risen following 
crackdowns on major cartels in neighboring colombia 
earlier this year bernard aronson us assistant secretary of 
state for latin american affairs estimated at least 99000 acres 
of coca crops are growing in bolivia 
 
echeverria who was handed over to us drug enforcement 
administration agents was a close aide to col luis arce gomez an 
interior minister under bolivias former military regime who was 
extradited to the united states last year 
arce gomez dubbed the minister of cocaine by dea officials 
is presently jailed near miami awaiting trial 
paz zamora ordered the extradition of arce gomez although he 
still faces charges in bolivia for human rights violations under 
the regime of gen luis garcia meza 
colombian president cesar gaviria in september modified his 
nations yearold extradition policy with a pledge that suspected 
cocaine traffickers who surrender to colombian authorities will not 
be extradited 
gaviria however said the decision does not apply to those 
captured by police 
colombia the main supplier of cocaine to the united states has 
extradited several suspected toplevel traffickers but pablo 
escobar head of the medellin cartel remains free 
the cartel named for the colombian city where much of its 
activity is based has demanded an end to the extraditions 
officials in colombia blame the cartel for more than 500 deaths 
this year including the assassinations of three presidential 
candidates

tragedy eclipsed the breeders cup on saturday 
with the deaths of two horses and the injuries of two toppled 
jockeys 
a 3yearold filly named go for wand fighting to keep the lead 
in the distaff snapped her right front ankle and crashed to the 
track just a stride inside the sixteenth pole 
go for wand was later destroyed behind screens to shield the 
crowd from her distress jockey randy romero who took a heavy 
tumble was removed from the track in an ambulance but returned 
later to ride in the 3 million classic 
bayakoa went on to win her second straight distaff and was 
greeted in the winners circle by her tearful trainer ron 
mcanally 
i cant cope with this mcanally said its like my wife 
said they give their lives for our enjoyment 
a horse named mr nickerson dropped dead on the turn during the 
running of the sprint no cause of death was immediately 
determined shaker knit fell over mr nickerson but escaped 
serious injury 
chris antley who was aboard shaker knit suffered a broken 
right collarbone 
some blamed the deaths of the horses on the track others blamed 
the roughness of the sport itself 
the day ended with unbridled bursting between horses about 50 
yards from the wire to win the classic the worlds richest horse 
race

president bush hey listen that shows that i dont like 
everything in the package i mean if i were all that enthusiastic 
about it youd have seen more republicans voting for it so nobody 
got it exactly the way he or she wanted but thats now its 
behind us as soon as i sign it thats behind us and i hope it 
will have the effect of bringing interest rates down but the 
philosophy of holding the line on spending and holding the line on 
taxes is my philosophy and i will be clearly advocating that 
q what kind of message will you use now then to replace your 
no new taxes pledge you know everybody was very accustomed to 
that all the republicans and i just want to know what slogan or 
rallying cry 
president bush well let me be clear im not in favor of new 
taxes ill repeat that over and over and over again and this one 
compromise that where we begrudgingly had to accept revenues 
revenue increases is the exception that proves the rule thats 
the way ill handle it 
q the exception that proves what rule 
president bush the rule that im strongly opposed to raising 
taxes on the american people and that we ought to do a better job 
of controlling spending and i think we can and so thats thats 
the message its loud and clear 
q will you reinstate today your no new taxes pledge 
perhaps no new new taxes do you think remember after 86 
that the congress passed a resolution saying they wouldnt tamper 
with it for five years do you think now the line should be drawn 
again and having made this compromise you should now hold the 
line on taxes again 
president bush absolutely going to hold the line on taxes and 
hopefully the big thing is to hold the line on spending so 
nobodyll come up and try to propose new taxes but i noticed one 
of the one of the democratic leaders said yesterday well he 
wants to raise income tax rates and hes going to have a whale of 
a fight on it this was a onetime compromise 
yeah 
q sir you really dont seem very enthusiastic about this 
budget deal you dont seem euphoric after all you and the others 
have been through 
president bush thats right 
q and i might well i might note 
president bush you got it 
q that it doesnt appear to meet your own objectives youve 
been insisting on a 500 billion deficitreduction target now only 
490 billion plus i understand the deal is based on rosy economic 
assumptions over which there is much disagreement how do you 
feel 
president bush i feel that its been a long arduous battle 
and i feel that every once in a while the president has to do 
something he doesnt like and that is to compromise and i did 
that here and so im glad its over and i have to say that the 
hours that the democratic leaders and the republican leaders spent 
working this problem have just been exhausting for everybody 
including me although they did much more of the work so im glad 
its behind us and i feel good that its behind us but i cant be 
euphoric about every provision in this bill i am very encouraged 
about the enforcement provisions because they are strong and no 
guy can go out and put in a put in a new program without the 
offset the guarantees of enforcement are strong and im going to 
do my level best to see that they stay strong 
so i think youre trying to describe mood im pleased its 
behind us and i will be out vigorously campaigning on the campaign 
trail for more republicans who feel as i do about holding the line 
on taxes and about spending and we have a difference of opinion 
you have more people that wanted to increase on the democratic 
side these permissive spending programs so the philosophy the 
fundamental philosophical underpinning yeah i havent changed my 
view on that and im sure the liberal democrats havent either 
but well take that case to the american people

president bush said saturday that as much as 
higher taxes make him want to gag he will sign a deficit 
restraining budget deal because it is good medicine for the 
economy 
peaking to reporters minutes after the senate gave final 
legislative approval to the fiveyear deal bush said he did not 
expect republican candidates to say they like the package as they 
near election day nov 6 
a lot of the members feel as i do they were gagging on 
certain provisions he said but im glad that its passed 
parts of it are good he said no i cant say this is the 
best thing thats happened to us since sliced bread or the 
elimination of broccoli 
but he said i am convinced this is good medicine for the 
economy 
as to how the defection of many republican members of congress 
reflected on his leadership he said if i were all that 
enthusiastic about it the budget package youd have seen more 
republicans voting for it 
now thats behind us as soon as i sign it he continued 
and i hope it will help bring interest rates down 
on another matter bush said he us military buildup in the 
persian gulf is continuing but declined to say whether it would 
result in additional 100000 troops being sent as widely reported 
last week 
asked about the prospects for offensive military action bush 
declined to state the reason for the additional troops but said 
the purpose is to make clear to iraqi president saddam hussein 
that his aggression will not stand 
he said he will make further decisions after consulting with 
defense secretary dick cheney and other top advisers after his 
return to washington on monday 
asked whether saddam is softening his position bush said as 
he sees the us forces moving in conjunction with other 
nations forces he has taken another look because we are deadly 
serious 
bush reiterated that any conditional withdrawal by saddam from 
kuwait is unacceptable 
he said he also spoke saturday to egypts president hosni 
mubarak about the middle east situation and that mubarak also was 
firm on unconditional withdrawal 
on other subjects bush 
said he plans to sign the sweeping clean air act just passed by 
congress 
dismissed as pure unadulterated gossip reports that various 
members of his cabinet and top staff would be leaving or changing 
jobs not that ive ever heard of he said he called it 
sheer mischief and asked who writes this stuff 
refused to say whether he wanted ed rollins a gop political 
strategist and cochairman of the national republican congressional 
committee to be dismissed because he recommended that republican 
congressional candidates feel free to distance themselves from the 
presidents decision to compromise on taxes for the sake of getting 
a budget agreement 
he said that talking about such matters would divert him from 
more important business i get diverted if you try to get me into 
some little staff matter he told reporters 
the president taking an approach he has voiced on the campaign 
trail in recent days said the budget agreement represents 
corrective action on a pattern of federal spending gone out of 
control 
bush said he did not expect republicans many of whom voted 
against him on the budget to like it or try to sell all aspects of 
it when campaigning 
there are certain things in it that i can strongly advocate 
there are some things in it that i had to gag and digest and so 
thats the approach im going to be taking and i expect everyone 
else will too he said when asked whether he would attack the 
democrats as architects of the package 
despite the tax increases in the bill he said one of the 
things im glad on is obviously weve held the line on income tax 
rates against democratic pressure to hike them higher 
all political points of view have sacrificed to get the 
agreement he said however he praised the enforcement measures in 
the package 
on the persian gulf bush was asked if there appeared a chance 
for a negotiated settlement of the standoff with saddam bush 
reiterated there is nothing to negotiate and that iraq should 
comply with the united nations resolution demanding iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait and restoration of the kuwaiti government 
im hopeful there will be a peaceful solution to this 
question but there can be no preconditions he said further 
bush said it appeared the un economic sanctions were having an 
effect and that saddam was taking note of the massive multinational 
military force deployed against him

q can you really tell the american people with all your heart 
that this is a good deal 
president bush parts of it are good no i cant say this is 
the best thing thats happened to us since sliced bread or the 
elimination of broccoli it is its got some good things in it 
but if it were doing it my way or the republican leader in the 
senates way or the republican leader in the houses way it would 
be very very different but i think it is good that we have a 490 
billion id like to have seen 500 billion but its a lot of 
money 490 billion enforceable deficitreduction program and that 
part that overall part i am enthusiastic about but how we got it 
i reserve the right to be as critical as the next person on that 
q mr president do you think it was proper for the republican 
congressional campaign committee to recommend that the partys 
candidates distance themselves from the president on this 
president bush oh i want everybody to be right with me on 
everything i do 
q is the architect of that strategy ed rollins history as far 
as youre concerned 
president bush that is inside the beltway i know how people 
love that they thrive on it i dont and you know ever since i 
got out around the country not one person has sidled up to me and 
asked me about that particular incident and im going to keep my 
sights set on the big picture and not accommodate you when you want 
me to go back into that i understand it i understand it because 
people thrive what was that laurie 
q is he out is he out 
president bush im not discussing it because wed divert me 
from the major goal which is to elect more republicans to agree 
that as i do hold the line on taxes and spending get people 
back to work in this country by getting interest rates down and 
empowering people not programs and bureaucrats so it i get 
diverted if you go try to get me into some little staff matter 
q conspicuously missing from that list of leaders that you 
recited mr president was the name of newt gingrich some people 
have suggested that you could have gotten a better deal if he had 
not led the republican revolt a couple of weeks ago do you think 
that he should remain in his leadership position because of his 
actions

said doesnt solve the countrys financial problems

xavier cugat the spanishborn band 
leader who introduced the tropical beat of the rumba to millions of 
americans died saturday he was 90 
cugat died of heart failure in a barcelona hospital doctors 
jorge rius and jaime pujadas said in a statement he had checked 
into the hospital oct 8 with a lung infection and failure of his 
left ventricle 
coogie as he became known to millions of americans and 
europeans became a star in the early 1930s playing latin dance 
music at the cocoanut grove club in los angeles and later at the 
waldorf astoria in new york 
cugat and his band the gigolos were featured in several 
popular hollywood movies in the 1940s and 1950s 
born jan 1 1900 in san cugat del valles near barcelona cugat 
began as a violinist at age 12 with the havana symphony in cuba 
where his parents moved when he was 4 to escape political 
persecution he had first appeared with the cuban orchestra six 
years earlier as a guest performer 
later the 12yearold musician with his violin under his arm 
and not a penny in my pocket went to the united states he 
became a us citizen three years later 
unable to find much work as a classical musician he made his 
way to hollywood where he drew caricatures of movie stars for the 
los angeles times 
rudolf valentino told cugat that the actor had to dance the 
tango in a silent film and asked the musician to put together a 
band to accompany him 
that was the beginning of cugat and his gigolos thanks to 
valentino they got an engagement at the legendary cocoanut grove 
in los angeles ambassador hotel 
that engagement led to others at al capones chez paris in 
chicago the hotel chase in st louis and more than a decade at new 
yorks waldorf astoria 
cugats career as a band leader stretched from the big band era 
in the 1940s to the 1960s he played the violin and directed the 
band with his bow 
i learned very early that everyone in the united states 
specialized in something cugat explained in a 1986 interview 
so i decided to specialize in tropical music we called it the 
rumba abierta then today they call it salsa but its all 
basically the same thing 
his splashy tropical hollywood films like neptunes 
daughter in which he starred with esther williams and red 
skelton in 1949 made his name a household word 
cugat had a history of heart ailments and high blood pressure 
he was hospitalized in los angeles before he gave up his band and 
returned to spain in 1978 
but despite further heart problems and hospitalization he 
formed a new 16piece band at the age of 86 and began touring 
spain 
cugat was married and divorced five times his wives were cuban 
rita montaner mexican carmen castillo chicagoborn lorraine 
allen brooklynborn abbe lane and spaniard charo baeza known 
professionally as charo 
if i had it to do all over id marry the same ones he 
said we always divorced for our careers you cannot play the 
violin in philadelphia when your wife is in rome making a movie 
with marcelo mastroianni 
cugat had no children but raised dogs and wrote two books i 
cugat and my wives

president bush remember the remember what was the give and 
take in the debate when ronald reagan said there you go again 
trying to get me caught up in something devisive newt gingrich 
stood out there in the white house im not sure you were there 
that day and strongly endorsed republican unity and thats 
exactly what should happen so please dont ask me to relive the 
agony of a budget agreement that i am glad is signed and is now 
behind us yes 
mr inaudible final question 
q well do you feel that the republican party has been badly 
hurt by this 
president bush no 
q and arent you sorry that 
president bush never inaudible 
q and arent you sorry that you couldnt have gotten more 
republican votes 
president bush not particularly sorry not gotten votes 
because a lot of the members feel as i do they were gagging on 
certain provisions but glad that its passed and i think if the 
bill this this compromise had been perfect from a republican side 
youd have seen obviously had many many more votes so i think 
those that didnt vote against it on both sides had problems with 
it 
some on the democratic side were saying we want to raise 
income tax rates on the american people more thats literally 
what they wanted to do they called it soak the rich but what 
they meant was when that bill that they passed in the congress for 
that indexing went after every working man and woman in this 
country and thats the old tax and spend view and some of them 
didnt feel it went far enough some on our side didnt like 
anything to do with revenues thats more along my line of 
thinking so i think it i think thats history now but i have no 
rancor about it im just glad its passed i wish it had been 
passed when we had the the summit agreement and wed have been 
much further along 
but i dont and back to your first part of your question no 
i sense strong enthusiasm for republican candidates and i think 
weve been caught up in a bit of inside smoke screen here but 
lets see now how we do im going to be out there working my heart 
out for republican candidates who feel as i do that we ought to 
hold the line on taxes and we ought to curtail spending 
q are we headed for a recession 
president bush i hope the economys sluggish and theres no 
question about that and i am convinced whether i like every 
paragraph of this or not that this is good medicine for the 
economy particularly if the federal reserve board now follows up 
with lowering interest rates you know that is whats needed and 
im not here to to do anything other than to state that that 
principle 
but i listen carefully to alan greenspans testimony and i was 
i was encouraged that interest rates might come down better than 
any program is getting these rates down so economic growth gets 
gets stimulated 
q you said you were going to review the appropriations has 
that process begun and are you certain that the appropriations 
bills that have been passed are not raising spending levels at the 
same time that youre claiming to have cut some and for deficit 
reduction 
president bush no im not sure of that jessica and i the 
process is under way of course but im not certain that there is 
sic no breaches of the spending goals yeah 
q sir if i could just switch to the gulf 
president bush a couple more and then ive got to go weve got 
a very interesting meeting with these pacific chiefs of state its 
a fascinating and long overdue meeting and im learning from them 
and i am giving them as best i can right from the shoulder the 
american view the importance of the pacific and i i know that 
given the budget summit at some and the interest that that that 
has stimulated that attention hasnt been focused elsewhere but 
this is this is a very important meeting and id say historic 
with these small countries but all friendly to the united states 
and all very important to the united states so ive got to get 
back down there in just a minute 
did i cut you off sandy 
q no sir 
president bush youve got a follow up then 
q just switch to the gulf crisis for a moment secretary cheney 
indicates we may send as many as 100000 new troops in and a lot 
more tanks whats the purpose sir if its not to to take 
offensive action and get engaged in combat with iraq 
president bush hold it just a minute chuckles power outage 
here we have not announced what we are going to do in terms of 
additional troops we have been still as everybody around the 
world knows still moving forces the purpose is to make clear to 
saddam hussein that his aggression will not stand and what i do in 
the future will be determined after i have a discussion with dick 
cheney and the chairman of the joint chiefs general scowcroft and 
secretary baker which i expect well be doing looking for help 
with brent when we get back and maybe well have more to say about 
that then 
but i believe i believe a couple of things on this one i 
think saddam hussein really felt that nobody was going to move 
against his aggression in kuwait i also believe that he really 
intended to threaten saudi arabia else why did he move all his 
armor south to the saudi border i think as he sees the us forces 
moving in conjunction with many arab country forces in conjunction 
with many european country forces in land and on the sea that hes 
taken another look because we are deadly serious and i want to 
see these economic sanctions work 
i i was im not too good at the emotional side of it but 
when you talk to the parents of these and spouses of our kids 
half way around the world it makes a real impact on you remember 
when i got off the plane at the marine base and they they were 
saying take care of my husband and yet we back you 100 
percent so theres i dont think thats a conflict exactly 
but i want to take care of every young man and woman thats serving 
the united states half way around the world 
but they want and i want to see that saddams aggression is 
unrewarded and indeed repudiated and so the moving of us force up 
to now has sent a strong signal to him we have the finest most 
highly motivated best trained best equipped armed forces in the 
world and theyre right there theyre right there in substantial 
numbers land air and sea now mr saddam hussein get out of 
kuwait with no condition and this talk of some condition that is 
unacceptable not just to the united states but to the other 
countries around the world i just got off the phone talking to 
audio break it is encouraging i am told that he now sees that 
hes up against a substantial force that clearly could prevail in 
any battle and so im hopeful that there will be a peaceful 
solution to this question but there can be no preconditions there 
can be no there can be no rewarding of aggression 
yeah

security sources said the victims were moslem extremists who took 
part in the assassination of the parliamentary speaker earlier this 
month 
a third suspect and two policemen were wounded in the afternoon 
shootout at cairo university police said a fourth suspect was 
captured by police the sources said 
police were led to the men by a moslem extremist arrested 
wednesday who confessed to particating in the slaying oct 12 of 
parliament speaker rifaat elmahgoub his driver and bodyguards 
the sources said 
as speaker of the peoples assembly elmahgoub was second in 
line to the presidency after president hosni mubarak 
a government statement issued late saturday said the suspects 
are members of the jihad group an underground moslem extremist 
organization linked to the oct 6 1981 assassination of president 
anwar sadat the group is also believed responsible for riots after 
the sadat slaying in the southern city of assiut which left 87 
people dead and 156 injured including many policemen 
the extremists were trying to overthrow the secular government 
and establish a theocratic regime 
but security sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
some of the suspects belonged to salvation from hell an extremist 
group that tried in 1987 to assassinate two former interior 
ministers and a journalist close to mubarak 
since elmahgoubs assassination authorities have detained more 
than 1000 people mostly iraqis or palestinians for 
questioning the government suspected that agents sent by iraq 
killed the speaker possibly in league with egyptian moslem 
extremists to punish egypt for leading arab opposition to iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
security sources only recently began concentrating on islamic 
militants after concluding that bombs found where elmahgoub was 
shot were similar to those used by fundamentalists in previous 
attacks 
one government source said the arrested suspect led police 
friday to a hideout where they captured five men he had identified 
as accomplices and weapons and ammunition similar to those used in 
the oct 12 ambush 
police said the arrested suspects set up a meeting at the 
university with other suspects and the police set a trap 
they had pistols an officer said of the suspects they 
opened fire on the forces the forces exchanged fire with them 
there were only slight injuries among the forces 
ministry sources said the suspect detained wednesday was among 
those arrested after the attempted 1987 assassinaion of former 
interior minister hassan abubasha the man escaped during his 
trial the sources said 
they said the hideout where the five men were arrested friday 
night was an apartment in a poor crowded neighborhood in the giza 
district southwest of cairo where many moslem fundamentalists 
live 
shortly before the shooting saturday egypts prosecutorgeneral 
banned local publication of information related to developments in

q there are two points to my question there are some people 
who are saying that the us continues to send in even more troops 
because the us has underestimated the iraqi troop strength that 
coupled with yesterday apparently in spain president gorbachev 
apparently said he notes a softening on the position of saddam 
hussein do you have any reason to believe there has been a 
softening has mr gorbachev told you something youd like to share 
with us has that softening manifested itself in any way 
president bush i have not noticed a softening but ive heard 
more you know kind of little threads of talk of quote 
negotiation unquote thats all i mean maybe thats what 
president gorbachev is talking about but he has not shared with me 
any feeling of a softening of of public opinion but what was 
the first part i didnt im afraid i didnt 
q has the us underestimated perhaps the troop strength of 
the iraqis is that why were continuing to send in more troops 
president bush no i think its true that saddam hussein beefed 
up his armor and his forces in kuwait from the original deployment 
he then has stepped that up by pouring more armor in ill never 
forget the day when he said well were taking our people out of 
kuwait and they had one forlornlooking soldier in the back of 
the truck waving goodbye the truck heading north and then he had 
all his armor moving south and so it was a sheer fraud and he 
moved a heck of a lot of armor down against the saudis 
and so i id leave it there but i think that when you see a 
lot of force there why the free world and those of us that are 
allied together are going to say wait a minute were not going 
to were going to do what weve got to do to protect american 
life or egyptian life or in this instance syrian life or 
saudi life and thats why youre seeing a substantial movement of 
us force and forces of other countries 
i keep repeating this because its a very important point it is 
not the united states versus saddam hussein it is the united 
states big majorities in the arab world and the united nations 
versus saddam hussein and that point i keep making it because 
he is still trying to trying to divide and weaken this strong 
coalition and hes failing he is failing miserably because all 
these countries are united against his brutal aggression 
yeah rita and then jessie ive im recanting because that 
wasnt very kind go ahead 
q just back on the budget for a minute what do you think it 
says about your leadership and your ability to lead the party that 
you couldnt get more republicans to stay with you and vote with 
you on this very important issue of the budget 
president bush i learned a lot from ronald reagan with whom i 
worked closely and watched and learned and in 19 what was it 
82 when we had that big tax bill i think we got fewer votes than 
we did today and he went right out and did beautifully what he 
what he felt in his heart he should do and say look im against 
increasing taxes and the american people know this and he went 
right on about his business and that agreement brought interest 
rates down and we all went forth and said wait a minute every 
once in a while when you dont control congress you dont get to do 
it exactly your way 
and so i understand republicans defecting from a package that 
they dont like that a president to make something happen once 
in a great while has to make a significant compromise and thats 
what i did and i think the american people understand that they 
know that im trying pretty hard and they know that i have their 
interest at stake when i want to see interest rates down and more 
jobs for the working man and woman in this country and thats the 
way id handle that one now the last one jessica and then i am 
leaving 
q well theres conventional wisdom and periscope and other 
information from our weeklies that suggest theres a cabinet 
shakeup in all of that that the budget directors going to be 
going to a financial firm that the chief of staff will be going to 
the campaign trail that skinner will come to the budget all kinds 
of things anybody else resign or retiring 
president bush jessica you know something i dont know who 
writes these columns periscope i mean you talk about sheer 
mischief and the ones ive seen you go back and look at them 
somebody ought to go not you all you do your job asking 
questions so i wish i were in the case to ask every all the 
knowledgeable people here who writes this stuff i mean if 
theres all that going on i dont know about it no we our 
cabinet 
q inaudible 
president bush not that ive ever heard of and maybe id be 
the last to know but i dont think so i think id be the first to 
know and id know it way ahea of periscope whoever he is 
whoever she may be and it is pure unadulterated gossip that comes 
out of these columns it is not serious coverage so so you know 
i cant i havent even seen this i guess they didnt dare show 
it to me because ive been a little irritable lately trying to get 
this job done but im going to finish my diatribe here 
huh 
q why would you be irritable 
president bush things arent going exactly the way i want them 
done i wish we could have got this deficit down without touching 
revenue i wish that we could have got it done without all this 
inside the beltway furor because its diverted me from major 
things major objectives 
q do you feel abandoned by republicans inaudible 
president bush no no no i feel happy about republicans im 
glad this is behind us and i wish we had more of them no matter 
what little philosophical wing of the party theyre from more of 
them all of them would be better than what i face when i try to 
get stuff done from the democrats i mean thats what its all 
about 
q inaudible strategists aides to clayton williams in texas 
who say hes losing points because youve come to texas and youre 
campaigning for him how do you feel about that 
president bush i feel theyre lying laughter otherwise why 
has he invited me back and i feel that my son who i talk to who 
talked to somebody high up tells me that the williams is doing 
very well so please go to texas and find out and take a look at 
how whether the president can help a candidate in texas or not 
please dont get it from some periscope if i might now wait 
just a minute here i have a major national announcement here 
linda sorry no im glad to be in the place from whence you 
cometh and i might say let me use this seriously to thank the 
people in honolulu your home i believe that for this 
wonderful hospitality and again i want to end on a nonpartisan 
note i i hope that you will record that this is a very important 
meeting the united states were caught up in iraq worries about 
saddam hussein and the new developments in eastern europe and my 
desire to help lift the debt off countries in south and central 
america but we never should neglect our friends and we are a 
pacific power and this meeting some of these leaders come from 
very small countries but they are properly proud of their 
sovereignty they are concerned about the very problems that i 
fight whether its environmental or economic growth or revenues 
and for me its been a wondrous day and i think it is very 
important that a president demonstrate in this instance to the 
people of the pacific that we are not going to neglect our friends 
no matter how pressing the business of the world might be from 
other quarters 
thank you all

benazir bhuttos party in early returns of provincial elections 
saturday threatening the ousted prime minister with her second 
defeat in a week 
at least 33 people were killed and about 50 injured in clashes 
between rival parties it was the bloodiest election day in 
pakistans 43year history 
the legislative elections in pakistans four provinces punjab 
sindh baluchistan and northwest frontier were considered a test 
of strength for the islamic democratic alliance a looseknit 
rightwing coalition of 18 parties that won national elections 
wednesday and will form the next government 
with more than half of the 483 provincial races decided ms 
bhuttos pakistan peoples party had lost nearly every race in 
punjab the largest province her party was also in danger of 
losing its majority in sindh ms bhuttos home province 
in elections wednesday for the national assembly the 
policymaking lower house of parliament that chooses the prime 
minster the islamic alliance defeated ms bhutto by a 2to1 
margin denying her a second chance to lead this moslem country of 
110 million people 
the 37yearold former prime minister accused the armybacked 
caretaker government of vote rigging but a team of international 
poll watchers said they found no evidence to back up that claim 
the elections were scheduled after pakistans president 
dismissed ms bhutto on aug 6 accusing her 20monthold 
government of corruption and incompetence 
the four provincial legislatures were disbanded hours after her 
government was dismissed 
election officials said turnout among pakistans 50 million 
eligible voters was moderate to light saturday with many polling 
stations empty they reported a heavy turnout in karachi the 
biggest city and ms bhuttos hometown 
more than 3700 candidates were vying for the 483 seats in the 
four assemblies 
the islamic alliance won 90 seats in the 248member assembly in 
punjab pakistans most populous state while ms bhuttos party 
got only two in sindh ms bhutto had won 30 seats in the 
109member assembly the islamic alliance had won 4 and its ally 
the mohajir qami movement took 20 
the mohajir qami movement represents moslems who immigrated to 
pakistan during the 1947 partition of the indian subcontinent it 
once was aligned with ms bhutto but later withdrew its support

northwest frontier holding a slight edge over a leftwing regional 
party ms bhuttos party had four seats

among the alliance the peoples party and two smaller parties the 
rest went to regional ethnic and religious parties and 
independents

home and power base 
sindh and its capital karachi have been wracked by ethnic 
violence that has claimed nearly 3000 lives in the past five 
years ms bhuttos inability to curb the bloodshed was one of the 
reasons cited by president ghulam ishaq khan when he dismissed her

patrolling the countrys most volatile areas during this weeks 
balloting half of them in sindh

a top afghan rebel commander saturday 
rejected any political settlement in his countrys civil war and 
vowed to launch attacks to break a twoyear military stalemate 
under no circumstances are we willing to share power said 
ahmad shah massoud the 37yearold commander was speaking to a 
group of foreign journalists at a walled compound outside the 
frontier town of peshawar 
speaking through a translator massoud said our strategy for 
the war is not to start from one point but to attack different weak 
points of the enemy 
the usbacked mujahadeen gurrillas began their antigovernment 
campaign 12 years ago they fought for nine years against both 
soviet military and afghan government troops 
since the soviets withdrew in february 1989 afghan president 
najibullah has made significant political gains by distancing 
himself from his communist roots and embracing islam in the 
predominately moslem nation of about 9 million people 
the rebels whose leaders are headquartered in peshawar 
reportedly control most of afghanistans mountainous rural regions 
while government soldiers control the major cities 
massoud repeated a call for elections in rebelheld territory by 
te end of march 1991 the mujahadeen leadership has been promising 
elections for almost two years but so far has failed to take any 
significant steps 
massouds military threats could disrupt talks between 
washington and moscow on a settlement of the conflict which has 
left 15 million people dead and 5 million refugees in pakistan and 
iran 
after several rounds of talks the united states and soviet 
union are expected to announce a final agreement by the end of the 
year 
the united states is reportedly ready to allow najibullah to 
participate in elections providing he cannot influence their 
outcome by remaining in control of key ministries 
in the past decade washington has supplied the mujahadeen with 
nearly 1 billion worth of weapons including stinger antiaircraft 
missiles 
the kremlin sends 500 million worth of military and 
humanitarian aid to kabul every month 
massoud met recently with other top rebel leaders to work out 
strategies but he offered little evidence to indicate the 
commanders would be able to to work together some of the rebel 
groups have been involved in bitter feuding

prime minister vp singh called his 
supporters to a rally saturday as he attempted to contain a 
rebellion by party members who want him to resign 
in a speech to 2000 loyalists on the lawn of his home singh 
gave no indication he was ready to step down he pledged his janata 
dal party would champion the downtrodden as he said it had done 
since he took office in december 
environment minister maneka gandhi quit singhs cabinet on 
friday accusing the prime minister of failing to keep his pledge 
of honesty and efficiency four parliament members once considered 
close to singh called on him to step down 
singh faces a noconfidence motion in a special session of the 
legislature nov 7 barring a lastminute compromise or a political 
realignment he seems certain to lose 
singh has been in trouble since tuesday when a hindumoslem 
dispute over rights to a holy site ballooned into the worst 
political crisis of the 10monthold government 
he was elected largely on the votes of the middle and educated 
classes who were disenchanted with the congress government led by 
rajiv gandhi 
as prime minister singh adopted policies aimed at expanding 
support with the poor alienating many of those who put him in 
power 
he also opposed construction of a hindu temple at ayodhya where 
a moslem mosque stands that alienated the rightwing bharatiya 
janata party and without its support singhs coalition no longer 
has a majority in parliament 
at least 93 people died last week in rioting between moslems and 
hindus and police efforts to quell the disturbances 
police on friday night clamped a curfew on ayodhya and on the 
neighboring town of faizabad 
hindu fundamentalists have vowed to build a temple at the site 
which they say is birthplace of lord rama a hindu god however 
the mosque has stood there for 460 years 
police said they have detained 51000 people in uttar pradesh 
state and seized more than 35000 tribal spears and other weapons 
from hindus on their way to ayodhya 300 miles southeast of new 
delhi

president bush promised disgruntled pacific 
island leaders saturday that their pristine ocean will not become a 
permanent dumping ground for chemical weapons or other wastes 
they in turn told him that good will toward washington had 
begun to dry up 
bush asked the leaders for their understanding and support for 
us plans to destroy huge stockpiles of chemical weapons already 
stored or en route to a giant new incinerator on johnston atoll a 
usheld ring of islands 825 miles southwest of hawaii 
the president met for more than two hours with the leaders of 11 
remote and economically vulnerable countries 
speaking on behalf of the leaders at the close of the meeting 
prime minister geoffrey a henry of the cook islands said they all 
wanted the johnston facility closed but we know of course that 
cannot be done 
standing alongside bush henry also spoke of a huge gulf of 
misunderstanding or misinformation between the islanders and the 
united states on the problem of global warming 
expressing skepticism about scientific reports minimizing the 
problem henry said wed love to read or hear what they tell 
you 
two navy ships carrying 100000 artillery shells loaded with 
nerve agents from the us armys stockpile in germany are expected 
to reach the atoll next month 
the weapons have become a major environmental issue throughout 
the pacific 
the south pacific forum an organization of regional 
governments claims that the use of johnston atoll could make the 
region the toxic waste disposal center of the world 
in his closing remarks bush said the pacific islands have a 
special place in the minds and hearts of the american people 
however henry portrayed a different picture saying the united 
states was too concerned with the problems of other places and 
you werent as interested in the problems of the people of our 
region 
henry said bush had begun to replenish the pool of good will 
that has begun to dry up since the last war the good will between 
pacific islands and the united states of america dont allow 
it to dry up 
several dozen demonstrators staged a noisy protest about 100 
yards from eastwest center where the leaders gathered 
dont make our pacific your cesspool read a large sign in 
the crowd there also were protests against us involvement in the 
persian gulf 
in advance of the meeting president john haglelgam of 
micronesia said bush needed to allay fears of tiny pacific 
countries that the united states is ignoring them 
opening the session bush said the united states will destroy 
the toxic weapons only under extremely stringent environmental 
controls and protections 
he said the johnston facility would be used to destroy only the 
300000piece stockpile already on the island and the weapons being 
shipped from germany along with any obsolete munitions found in 
the pacific islands that would rule out using the facility for 
chemical weapons stored on the us mainland 
once that destruction is completed we have no plans to use 
johnston atoll for any other chemical munitions purpose or as a 
hazardous waste disposal site bush pledged 
he acknowledged that the whole issue has caused many of you 
deep concern our ability to move ahead and destroy chemical 
weapons is a significant step toward disarmament and peace 
tests of the incinerator are to end late next year and 
fullscale incineration is expected to begin in 1992 the united 
states and soviet union have agreed to destroy such weapons by 
1997 
the state department has issued a statement saying opposition to 
the incineration project must be weighed carefully against the 
longterm benefits both to world peace and the environment that 
will result from the total destruction of chemical weapons and a 
permanent ban on their acquisition and use 
conferring with bush were the presidents or prime ministers of 
fiji nauru papua new guinea western samoa cook islands 
kiribati the marshall islands micronesia and tuvalu tonga and 
the solomon islands also sent lowerranking representatives 
on another front bush reminded the leaders that the crisis in 
the persian gulf has increased energy costs for the pacific 
islands 
the gulf crisis underlines global interdependence making it 
imperative that all countries large and small join forces to work 
for peace and democracy throughout the world he said 
bush also said that the overseas private investment corp a 
government supported organization that helps private interests 
invest in foreign countries will establish a 200 million venture 
capital fund and environmental investment fund called the 
asianpacific growth fund and a 100 million environmental 
investment fund for sustainable natural resource development

to pacific island countries next year that the united states wants 
to negotiate an extension of the south pacific fisheries treaty and 
that the state departments agency for international development 
will set up four development assistance programs for private sector 
development emphasizing agricultural and marine resources 
aside from environmental concerns the pacific leaders fear that 
us development assistance will be cut back 
they also wanted to press bush to embrace the south pacific 
nuclear free zone treaty that bans the use testing dumping and 
storage of nuclear weapons and nuclear waste in the region the 
administration has refused to submit the fiveyearold treaty to 
the senate

william s paley who cultivated a fledgling 
radio network into the 3 billionayear communications 
conglomerate cbs inc was remembered by colleagues saturday as a 
brilliant pioneer in broadcasting 
they recalled his programming genius for both high art and 
massentertainment programs as well as a deep commitment to the 
news 
anyone with means can collect picassos and gauguins but it 
took a bill paley to collect jack bennys and jackie gleasons 
lucille balls and mary tyler moores and at the same time ed 
murrows eric sevareids charles collingwoods and walter 
cronkites said don hewitt executive producer of 60 minutes 
paley 89 died friday night in his manhattan home the cause of 
death was believed to be a heart attack brought on by pneumonia 
cbs said in a statement saturday 
paley bought a handful of struggling radio stations in 1929 for 
400000 and built them into one of the worlds most powerful 
communications companies for more than 50 years he controlled the 
columbia broadcasting system as president or board chairman of its 
radio and television networks and its film publishing recording 
and other subsidiaries 
the pioneer era in the history of broadcasting dies with 
william paley said cronkite a former cbs anchorman he 
understood as have few others the necessity of giving broadcast 
news a liberty to perform without commercial or political 
interference 
he was a giant of 20th century business a man committed to 
excellence said dan rather cronkites successor at cbs news 
among his many accomplishments was being present at the creation 
of broadcast journalism he remained passionately interested in 
news up to the time of his death 
fred friendly who was president of cbs news from 1964 to 1966 
worked for paley for 16 years a lot of the fun and the glory 
the nobility that he possessed has sort of vanished in the throes 
of profits he said 
frank stanton president emeritus of cbs inc said paley was a 
programming genius 
call it skill inspiration or luck he said it takes all 
of them and he had all of them in abundance moreover he had the 
resources and the courage to implement his ideas 
paley worked more than a decade past normal retirement age 
giving final approval to all major policy decisions its like 
having a child he once said its pretty hard to jerk yourself 
away from that entirely 
frank sinatra credited paley with giving him his first real 
break in broadcasting paley heard sinatra singing at a club and 
put him on a cbs radio show that brought him to the attention of 
band leader harry james 
harry offered me a job singing with his orchestra and 
everything skyrocketed from then on sinatra said in a statement 
if it wasnt for bill paley i dont know when i wouldve gotten 
a break he was one of the best friends ill ever have 
the grandson of a russian lumber magnate paley was born in 
chicago on sept 28 1901 he studied at western military academy 
in alton ill and the university of chicago before receiving a 
bachelor of science degree at the university of pennsylvanias

upon graduation he joined his fathers firm the congress cigar 
co as vice president and secretary 
paley became interested in radio when he saw how successful 
radio ads were for the companys la palinas cigar 
in 1928 he bought the yearold united independent broadcasting 
corp with money borrowed from his father he changed its name to

h wyman who had been president and chief executive officer since 
1980 paley stayed on as a consultant director and chairman of the 
board of directors executive committee 
when cbs biggest stockholder loews corp became unhappy with 
wymans policies paley teamed with loews chairman lawrence 
tisch in 1986 to retake control paley as chairman and tisch as 
president and chief executive officer 
paley had handpicked a series of heirs apparent in his later 
years and had no compunction about dumping them when he felt they 
did not measure up to the man they were supposed to replace 
david halberstam author of the powers that be an 
authoritative account of leading news organizations including cbs 
commented that because paley hated the idea of turning the shop 
over to a successor he failed to institutionalize the 
protections he had given to the newsroom so cbs has slipped 
in his 1979 autobiography as it happened paley said he may 
not have praised his subordinates often enough i like to 
believe however that they understand me and know how i feel about 
them he wrote 
paley became a fixture in new yorks high society with the help 
of his second wife babe the former barbara cushing who died

congress agreed saturday to renew for another 
year a ban on offshore oil drilling along thousands of miles of 
us coastline from alaska to new england 
the moratorium on the sale of offshore oil leases was contained 
in the interior departments fiscal 1991 appropriations bill worked 
out by a housesenate conference committee 
the bill was adopted by both the house and senate late saturday 
with this legislation congress continues to insist upon 
protection of sensitive offshore areas said rep leon panetta 
dcalif 
congress has blocked oil development along much of the nations 
outer continental shelf for nearly a decade through annual 
moratoria on lease sales as part of interiors budget 
but this year while the house had included the ban the senate 
version of the bill had not causing concern among 
environmentalists oil companies have intensified their campaign 
for increased domestic oil production since the beginning of the 
persian gulf crisis 
but the lawmakers adopted the house version that broadened the 
ban to include not only leases off southern florida california and 
new england but for the first time alaskas bristol bay the 
eastern gulf of mexico off northern florida and along a 50mile 
buffer in the atlantic from rhode island to maryland 
drilling also is prohibited off the pacific northwest and under 
separate legislation approved earlier off north carolina 
last summer president bush announced that he was postponing in 
some cases for as long as 10 years oil and gas lease sales off the 
west coast new england and southern florida until environmental 
concerns can be resolved 
environmentalists however had pushed for congress to renew its 
ban to guard against the president backing away from his decision 
the persian gulf crisis and subsequent embargo of iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil has put a spotlight on americas dependence on oil 
imports as a result the petroleum industry has campaigned for 
opening parts of the outer continental shelf for oil and gas 
development the leases are held by the interior department 
we had been nervous about this said lisa speer an attorey 
who specializes in offshore oil issues for the natural resources 
defense council a private environmental group 
she said the lawmakers decision to keep the moratorium was 
the first real test to protecting the offshore areas since iraq 
invaded kuwait

ending a yearlong struggle the senate on 
saturday passed 8910 and sent to president bush a tougher clean 
air law to stem acid rain urban smog and toxic industrial 
pollution 
bush in hawaii told reporters he would sign the bill passed 
in the waning hours of the 101st congress in a sessionending call 
to senate leaders he called it another good step for the 
country 
the legislation totaling more than 1100 pages will impose 
more stringent pollution controls on automobiles factories 
coalburning power plants and thousands of businesses it cleared 
the house on a 40125 vote late friday 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the bill 
a long overdue step to renewing our national commitment to an 
active effective and aggressive program of controlling the 
pollutants that threaten the air we and all americans breathe 
its the most comprehensive environmental bill of the last 
quartercentury declared sen max baucus dmont 
but the legislation was not without ardent critics sen steve 
symms ridaho denounced the measure in a twohour floor speech as 
too expensive a threat to economic growth and unnecessary 
although the legislation carries an eventual price tag estimated 
at 22 billion a year or more by the year 2005 its supporters 
argued that to do nothing toward cleaning up the nations air would 
be even more costly from higher healthcare bills and related 
economic losses 
congress first began debating the legislation more than a year 
ago along with requiring new autoemission controls and 
cleanerburning gasoline it establishes firsttime requirements 
for industry to install equipment aimed at cutting the release of 
toxic chemicals including many cancercausing agents by 90 
percent over the next eight years 
and it demands also for the first time steep reductions in 
emissions from coalburning electric power plants that cause acid 
rain 
the house approved the measures friday after two hours of debate 
in which some congressmen expressed concern about the bills cost 
to the economy nevertheless only a few members of the house voted 
against it 
this bill will be the standard by which we will judge 
environmental legislation in the 90s rep mike synar dokla 
declared 
despite the lopsided house and senate votes the legislation is 
the product of months of intense bargaining tradeoffs and 
compromises 
among the provisions 
smogproducing emissions from automobiles must be cut by 30 
percent to 60 percent and gasoline sold in areas with smog problems 
must be 15 percent cleaner toward the end of the decade 
more than 100 cities that are failing to meet federal 
airquality standards will have to develop pollutioncontrol plans 
to bring their air into compliance over the next five to 17 years 
depending on the severity of the problem the los angeles area is 
given 20 years 
factories and businesses must install new technology to cut 
toxic chemical emissions by 90 percent over the next eight years 
the requirements cover 189 hazardous chemicals including many 
cancercausing agents 
annual sulfur dioxide emissions must be cut by 10 million tons 
by the year 2000 to reduce acid rain midwest utilities that 
operate the dirtiest coalburning plants will be hit the hardest 
failure to meet the new federal requirements could open 
polluters to civil penalties of up to 25000 a day criminal 
penalties may be sought against corporate executives for willful 
release of hazardous air pollutants that pose a serious health 
threat 
most of the new pollution requirements would be phased in over 
10 to 15 years the requirements for cleanerburning motor fuels 
and reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions from coalburning power 
plants take effect by 1995 
the clean air requirements are expected to have widespread 
effects on society consumers are likely to pay slightly more for 
automobiles as well as gasoline and in many of the midwestern 
states more for electricity small businesses and huge 
petrochemical plants alike will have to invest in pollutioncontrol 
equipment and improve the monitoring of chemical releases 
cost estimates for the new controls have varied widely the 
bills supporters have said the legislation will cost the economy 
about 10 billion a year beginning in 1995 and about 22 billion by 
the year 2005 when most of the requirements will be in effect 
industry estimates have been much higher with some studies 
predicting annual costs from the legislation by 2005 of more than 
60 billion 
voting against the bill in the senate were robert byrd dwva 
alan dixon dill jake garn rutah john glenn dohio orrin 
hatch rutah jesse helms rnc james mcclure ridaho jay

above a photo of strikers vandalizing a bus carrying replacement 
workers inside there were ads to fill the strikers jobs in all 
departments at the paper 
new yorks hometown paper is run by a bunch of outoftowners 
its not right said striker joe burgess who has worked in the 
news art department since 1971 
news management said saturday that about 100 permanent 
replacements had been hired already striking workers were welcome 
to return to their old jobs at their old salaries at any time until 
a permanent replacement is hired for that slot said news vice 
president john sloan 
any employee that wants to return can do so sloan said 
we have not fired anybody 
for editorial employees the weekend was a time to consider the 
future sloan has said some temporary writers and editors were 
recruited from other tribune co newspapers for temporary duty 
besides the daily news the chicagobased tribune co also owns 
the chicago tribune thesunsentinel in fort lauderdale and the 
orlando sentinel in orlando fla the timesadvocate in escondido 
and the peninsula times tribune in palo alto calif and the daily 
press and the timesherald in newport news va 
the daily news normally operates with a small weekend staff and 
mondays edition will show whether the picket lines outside the

the 64page paper included some features that ordinarily run in 
the sunday paper a message to news readers asked them to bear with 
the paper despite the inconvenience attributable to vandalism 
and violence by striking workers 
a team of four editors covered the strike for the news they 
described the normally bustling city room as a sea of empty 
desks dotted with editors long out of practice as reporters 
at stake is the future of the 71yearold daily which has been 
in a financial tailspin for the past decade the news has lost 
about 115 million and seen daily circulation slip by about 700000 
since 1980 
unlike most strikes though there are no negotiations in 
progress or planned the news plans to replace the strikers with 
new permanent employees and continue to publish 
union contracts expired in march 
a skeleton crew of about a dozen strikers walked outside the

for ferries their only transportation to the mainland since the 
dredge broke free of moorings in a gale friday and hit herbert 
bonner bridge 
the northerly island dredge took out a 369foot section of the 
bridge and snapped power lines that ran underneath the span 
leaving about 8000 people on hatteras and ocracoke islands without 
electricity and telephone service 
generators flown in by helicopter were used to restore power to 
some people while utility crews worked on putting up temporary 
lines expected by sunday 
the temporary lines could not be put up until the dredge was 
pulled from sand it took three tugs about two hours to remove the 
dredge 
there was a sixhour wait to get on a ferry from hatteras to 
ocracoke where the wait for a ferry was 24 hours for the final leg 
to the mainland 
residents were warned to conserve water and fuel their 
predicament may seem daunting but many consider such emergencies a 
way of life on the islands 
were running out of gas and fuel the usual stuff said 
bert austin sheriff of dare county on hatteras island the 
local people are used to having problems thats part of the 
islands heritage 
gwen white a dare county emergency management spokeswoman said 
the hatteras island water tank was about threequarters full and 
residents should have no problem if electricity were restored soon 
food supplies are still perfectly good and plentiful right 
now ms white said as far as bringing food in the next few 
days that may become a problem if the ferries cant run 
ferries couldnt run friday after the bridge collapse because of 
high wind the forecast called for mild weather through sunday 
there have been no reports of looting sheriffs lt almey gray 
said 
ocracoke has about 3000 permanent residents and hatteras has 
about 5000 permanent residents

corner on hatteras another station in town was out of gasoline 
since rationing started its been a mad rush to the service 
station said cape hatteras school principal jimmy webb

its very inconvenient to be cut off but so is living in the 
city

will return to class monday webb said until then the school will 
be used as a shelter red cross workers were brought in aboard an 
army helicopter to set up shop there 
most people that live here are ready for a month or so of 
siege webb said 
at a national weather service station on hatteras workers

liver failure may be killing thousands of dolphins 
in the mediterranean sea the sunday times quoted scientists as 
saying 
the report said studies on some of the 10000 striped dolphins 
estimated to have died in the past three months found that all had 
suffered acute liver damage researchers however were not certain 
if the problem was linked to pollution natural toxins in algae or 
a disease similar to hepatitis 
the disease was earlier believed by some scientists to be caused 
by the morbilli virus that killed thousands of seals in the north 
sea two years ago the sunday times reported morbilli has been 
found in 60 percent of the dolphins examined 
but its absence in the remaining 40 percent has raised a 
question mark over the real cause of death the newspaper said 
two researchers quoted in the article suggested there may be 
other reasons for the deaths of the dolphins which have been found 
in spain france italy and north africa 
phil hammond a biologist at the sea mammal research unit in 
cambridge england said morbilli virus may weaken some dolphins 
after they contracted another disease that destroys their livers 
alex aguilar a marine biologist at barcelona university in 
spain who is coordinating the international investigation into the 
deaths said the dolphins had liver lesions caused by some virus 
other than morbilli or by toxins accumulated in the organ 
he said the dolphins had lost most of their blubber indicating 
they were ailing for two months before death 
more than 1000 bottlenose dolphins have died since 1987 on the 
us atlantic coast and in the gulf of mexico 
some researchers have blamed pneumonia but other theories range 
from cold winter weather to algae blooms or red tide

congress gave final approval to a record 
package of taxes and spending cuts saturday as lawmakers dashed 
through a stack of major bills and toward adjournment of their long 
electionyear session 
the senate voted 5445 to embrace the budget compromise the 
centerpiece of a 496 billion deficitreduction plan and 
president bush said he would sign it into law the action came a 
few hours after the senate gave final congressional approval to the 
most wideranging clean air bill in 13 years 
the deficitreduction measure reaches into the wallets of 
everyone from buyers of gasoline to medicare recipients but takes 
special aim at the rich voting for the budget were 35 democrats 
and 19 republicans it was opposed by 20 democrats and 25 
republicans 
president bush said in honolulu that he would sign the bill 
because for the first time weve made significant and long term 
cuts in federal spending that should have a positive impact on 
americas economic future 
noting that the bargaining that led to the budget has 
sometimes been painful the president said 
all political points of view have sacrificed to bring this 
agreement about needless to say i dont like raising taxes never 
will but there is a price to divided government and that means 
that i have had to compromise on items that i feel strongly about 
in order to do what i think is best for the country 
congressional leaders made their ceremonial endofsession call 
to the president this time in advance of actual adjournment to 
tell bush that congress was nearing the close of business 
your biggest problem is over mr president congress is going 
to leave quipped senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine expressed 
special gratitude to bush for his support of tough clean air 
legislation 
bush said i know weve had some altercations along the way 
but the tax and budget deal youve hammered out is good for the 
country 
as debate began on the measure which sat 10 inches tall on 
senators desks and weighed 24 pounds lawmakers said the 
sacrifices it would demand were necessitated by years of growing 
budget gaps that have helped weaken the economy 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said the 
measure would begin a fundamental adjustment to too many years of 
indulgence and excess 
it will be worse for america worse for this decade worse for 
our children if we do not reduce this lingering pervasive deficit 
now said the budget panels ranking republican sen pete 
domenici of new mexico 
with two of the white house officials who helped negotiate the 
plan watching from the visitors gallery chief of staff john 
sununu and budget director richard darman opponents objected that 
farmers would be hit too hard and that the measure imposed a new 
burden taxpayers do not need 
youre going to see the working struggling people of this 
country will be hit by increased taxes and fees said sen trent 
lott rmiss 
but after 10 months of intense and partisan budget warfare 
exhausted lawmakers said it was time to close the deal 
ive left my wife without much firewood out in the country 
joked sen james jeffords rvt its time to get home 
tired and testy the lawmakers pushed to complete work on a host 
of bills standing in the way of a hopedfor weekend adjournment 
including final passage of historic clean air legislation 
the house worked out some lastminute snags on senatepassed 
legislation embracing the first major overhaul of the nations 
legal immigration system in a quartercentury and the bill was 
passed and readied for dispatch to the white house 
congress passed legislation that would establish new grant 
programs for child care and increase tax credits for lowincome 
families with children in the name of childcare assistance 
both chambers neared the finish of work on bills appropriating 
money for government operations for the budget year that started 
oct 1 including final passage of a 155 billion foreign aid 
bill when all in place they will appropriate approximately 12 
trillion to operate the government for the current fiscal year 
congress approved emergency financing of the government through 
nov 5 the fifth temporary extension of spending authority since 
oct 1 this will keep the government going while the 
deficitreduction bill is drafted into legislative form and signed 
by bush federal authority to spend money technically ended at 
midnight saturday night the stopgap was to be flown to bush and 
the white house said he would sign it in san francisco either 
sunday or monday 
just before dawn saturday the house approved the budget 
228200 with the support of most democrats and a few republicans 
some representatives criticized the plans taxes and others lauded 
its whack at federal red ink 
but all agreed with buttons some sported that pleaded free the 
101st congress 
even with the plan the federal deficit will remain formidable 
the red ink for the fiscal year is expected to reach a record 254 
billion even with the 40 billion in savings the budget would 
produce the bill envisions that the overall federal debt is 
expected to soar from just over 3 trillion to nearly 5 trillion 
over the next five years 
but lawmakers on both sides said it was the best compromise they 
could reach it was achieved only after a year that saw bush 
abandon his campaign vow of no new taxes and congressional 
republicans split deeply over taxes democrats achieved many 
demands for taxes on the rich while swallowing deeper spending cuts 
than they liked 
the package the fruit of six months of negotiations was 
originally designed as a 500 billion deal but some unpopular 
savings dropped out of the tax bill during lastminute efforts to 
round up votes other savings will come from pentagon cuts in other 
legislation and interest payments on the debt that will now be 
less than expected 
the bill would raise taxes by 137 billion boosting the 
9centagallon gasoline tax by a nickel and raising levies on 
alcohol tobacco airline tickets and luxury items like yachts 
the 600000 wealthiest americans who now pay a 28 percent 
incometax rate would enter the 31 percent bracket the 4 million 
others who are almost as welloff including couples earning 
between 80000 and 160000 would see their rates drop from 33 
percent to 31 percent 
itemized deductions would be reduced by 3 percent for incomes 
above 100000 yearly and people earning more than that amount 
would face a phaseout of the 2050 personal exemption 
the 145 percent medicare payroll tax would be deducted from 
salaries up to 125000 instead of the current 51300 cap 
medicare serving 33 million elderly and handicapped people 
would be cut 44 billion from the amount it was expected to reach 
by 1995 beneficiaries would shoulder 10 billion of that cut 
doctors and hospitals would bear the rest 
the 2860 monthly medicare premium beneficiaries pay for 
doctors expenses would rise gradually to 4650 by 1995 the 75 
annual deductible for doctors bills would grow to 100 
medicaid which helps the poor afford medical care would be 
reduced by 600 million but at the same time there would be new 
spending for the lowincome elderly and children some coverage for 
mammograms and new restrictions on abuses by private health 
insurers of senior citizens
