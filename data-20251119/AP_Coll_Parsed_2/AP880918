military convoy in western england saturday and antinuclear 
activists claimed the convoy was transporting nuclear weapons 
police said the driver of the mg midget car was killed but there 
were no other casualties

the public but he would neither confirm nor deny claims a truck 
leading the convoy was carrying nuclear depth bombs

coast 
depth bombs are designed for use aircraft to attack submarines 
colin hines a spokesman for the environmentalist group 
greenpeace said saturdays accident and another convoy accident in

the littleknown 140 naval nuclear depth bombs and 50 naval nuclear 
freefall bombs 
its time for this nuclear transport to stop and for britains 
naval nuclear weapons to be put upon the disarmament agenda he 
said

not evacuated 
we have special contingency plans for situations where an 
accident occurs involving a sensitive load they were not put into 
operation in this case he said he was not indentified in 
keeping with british practice

the reagan administration has sent two messages to 
panamanian military leader manuel antonio noriega in recent days 
inviting him to resume bilateral talks that collapsed in may the 
general said in an interview 
noriega said he sees the alleged overtures by the us 
government as a positive step and added that his regime is 
ready to start serious scientific and realistic negotiations 
immediately the miami herald reported from panama in its sunday 
edition 
us officials confirmed there were meetings with members of 
the ruling coalition in the last few days but added these were 
part of regular meetings with a crosssection of panamanian 
political leaders they denied these were proposals for new 
negotiations 
noriega said he is ready to meet facetoface with ousted 
president eric delvalle without preconditions if that helps 
solve panamas crisis 
previously noriega said he would never sit down with delvalle 
who unsuccessfully tried to fire him as commander of panamas 
defense forces early this year 
noriega had generally shunned the press since he was indicted 
feb 4 in miami and in tampa for drug smuggling and his country 
exploded into political crisis 
the herald interview thursday was at the main office of the 
general torrijos military base in rio hato about 68 miles 
northwest of panama city 
the us government in may offered to lift two drug indictments 
against noriega if he would step down but subsequently 
presidential candidates george bush and michael dukakis both said 
they oppose any deal that would result in dismissal of the 
indictments 
referring to the us dispatches noriega said we have 
received a message from the us embassy transmitted to us through 
panamas commerce minister mario rognoni with suggestions or 
open doors to continue the talks that had been suspended 
john maisto the us embassys deputy chief of mission 
delivered the message last wednesday to rognoni noriega said 
an embassy official said written talking points were 
delivered describing us positions on panama but said they were 
summaries of ontherecord us policy the state department has 
set out guidelines that no further negotiations with noriega are 
expected 
the reagan administration has said it still recognizes delvalle 
who is in hiding in panama as the head of state

the caribbean council of churches 
denounced the killing of 13 parishioners and the burning of two 
churches in haiti and urged the us and caribbean governments to 
condemn haitis military rulers 
but late saturday haiti deposed its military leader lt gen 
henri namphy and two military commanders took power a government 
spokesman said in portauprince the haitian capital 
it was unclear whether the attacks on sept 11 and the following 
day blamed on the government were related to namphys ouster 
the church council which represents roman catholic and 
protestant churches in 16 caribbean countries said the bloody 
attacks were coldblooded cruelty which was shocking even by the 
brutal standards of haitian repression 
while army critic rev jean bertrand aristide said mass sept 11 
at st jean bosco church in haiti two dozen people armed with guns 
and knives attacked killed parishioners before burning down the 
building as soldiers watched from across the street 
nine were killed in the massacre and 77 were wounded of which 
four died at in the hospital radio haiti inter said saturday 
five men and a woman that night boasted on government television 
they took part in the massacre and the next day arsonists burned 
down a second roman catholic church 
the inaction of the government security forces can only be 
interpreted as collusion with the method of terrorizing the haitian 
population into silence said the councils statement released 
friday 
though the government of lt gen henri namphy said it 
regretted the massacre and promised to punish the culprits 
similar statements issued after mass killings in the past have 
never resulted in investigations or convictions 
namphy returned to power after ousting the 4monthold 
government of civilian president leslie manigat in a coup june 19 
namphy previously ruled for two years after the exile to france of 
presidentforlife jeanclaude duvalier on feb 7 1986 
but on saturday namphy was ousted in a military coup and taken 
to the airport said frantz lubin haitis director of information 
lubin said he believed commander prosper avril had been named the 
new head of state and dessalines barracks commander jeanclaude 
paul as new commanderinchief of the army

a tunisian diplomat has been expelled for failing 
to pay hundreds of dollars in parking fines the foreign office 
said saturday 
the office confirmed a published report in sundays editions of 
the mail in which foreign office minister timothy eggar wrote that 
administrative attache sadok kassous was ordered to leave about 
three weeks ago as part of a crackdown on envoys who break the law 
the article did not give an exact figure 
the report of kassous departure follows the expulsion within 
the past week of three diplomats cubas ambassador a cuban 
attache and a vietnamese envoy in connection with firearms 
violations 
in 1984 diplomats in london failed to pay about 100000 parking 
tickets he said 
the newspaper in a separate article on the expulsion quoted 
tunisian economic attache hatem bergaoui as saying kassous refused 
to pay the tickets because his embassy was allocated three parking 
spaces for six diplomats 
a foreign office official said he did not know when kassous left 
the country 
cubas ambassador and commercial attache were expelled tuesday 
after the attache opened fire in a london street and wounded a man 
cuba said he fired at a cia operative trying to get him to defect 
their expulsion came within days of a vietnamese diplomat being 
ordered out for brandishing a gun at demonstrators outside his

about 450 antiabortion activists were arrested during 
demonstrations saturday outside clinics where abortions are 
performed in new jersey and california police said 
the arrests were the latest resulting from operation rescue a 
new yorkbased organization that has spawned antiabortion protests 
around the nation in recent months 
police in shrewsbury nj arrested about 250 chanting and 
singing protesters for blocking entrances to a planned parenthood 
clinic 
we picked planned parenthood because they are the mcdonalds 
franchise of the abortion industry said chris slattery a 
spokesman for bistate operation rescue network which organized 
the demonstration in shrewsbury about 45 miles southeast of newark 
the planned parenthood in shrewsbury is the only one of eight in 
new jersey that performs abortions as well as provide family 
planning counseling said phyllis kinsler executive director of 
planned parenthood of monmouth county 
she said the 15 or so women who had appointments for abortions 
for saturday were warned of the demonstration but none rescheduled 
their appointments 
ironically what has happened is that these people scared away 
walkins who may have wanted birthcontrol devices or 
information she said at the same time the people who wanted 
the abortions were there they showed up 
the demonstrators were taken to the shrewsbury fire department 
where they were arraigned on charges of trespassing and violating a 
1984 court injunction that prohibits protests at the clinic 
in san francisco about 200 people were arrested saturday when 
they surrounded the pregnancy consultation center police said 
police chief frank jordan said the arrest procedure was very 
lengthy because demonstrators were lifted up and carried away 
which is very time consuming 
we were trying to be as diplomatic as possible said sgt 
jerry senkir but its obvious these people want to be arrested 
in new jersey police estimated 250 antiabortion protesters and 
50 counterprotesters demonstrated at the center which performs 
abortions twice a week 
were just trying to prevent abortions said liz brouth a 
spokeswoman for operation rescue which claims 1000 members in 
california 
brouth said 250 members and supporters surrounded the facility

a forecast for up to 6 
inches of snow gave firefighters prospects saturday of reinforcing 
battle lines against fires that have burned for nearly three months 
this forecast is music to our ears said ken dittmer one of 
yellowstones area commanders 
but high winds preceded the storm with more than 40 mph gusts 
in some areas firefighters fought a fire that threatened roosevelt 
lodge because of the winds 
i hope this thing decides to take a nap soon said capt ron 
goetzinger who heads a team of firefighters from brainerd minn 
the snow should take care of it we sure hope so 
the storm forecast to swing into yellowstone sometime saturday 
night was expected to leave much of its moisture on the northern 
sections of the countrys first national park dittmer said 
fires burning in northern yellowstone including the 
335300acre north fork blaze have been the most active in recent 
days and got the least moisture from a front that passed through 
the park a week ago according to the commander that previous rain 
represented about the first significant moisture in the park since 
spring 
it couldnt come to a better place he said 
the north fork fire is the one that burned buildings in the 
tourist complex at old faithful geyser and threatened west 
yellowstone mont and park headquarters at mammoth hot springs 
it and other fires have blackened almost half of the 
22millionacre park 
despite progress toward containment of the flames with fire 
lines park officials declined even to venture when the blazes 
could be called controlled officials would say only that they 
predict the north fork half contained saturday may be fully 
contained sometime the middle of next month 
the national weather service said showers would change to snow 
during the night with accumulations of 4 to 6 inches possible by 
sunday morning daytime temperatures were expected to remain in the 
40s and 50s through wednesday falling below freezing at night 
its time to break out the sweaters commented park 
spokeswoman judy jennings 
she said the fires did not grow friday despite gusty winds that 
whipped up flames after several days of calm 
other major fires in the park included the 411500acre 
clovermist fire in northeastern yellowstone 75 percent contained 
saturday and the 225500acre huckmink fire in southern 
yellowstone and the bridgerteton national forest declared fully 
contained 
elsewhere officials gave a day off to some firefighters in 
glacier national park where a 35000acre fire has resisted 
efforts to douse it and crews were released from another wildfire 
as steady rain and snow pelted much of western and central montana 
saturday 
the weather bureau issued a winter storm warning for today in 
western and central montana predicting up to a halffoot of snow 
in the foothills and a foot of snow in the mountains 
high humidity and temperatures in the 40s helped firefighters in 
idaho to keep most fires within the boundaries of the frank 
churchriver of no return gospel hump and selwaybitterroot 
wilderness areas still active fires had charred nearly 200000 
acres 
the only thing consistently in our favor is winter is 
coming said mary zabinski spokeswoman for the nez perce

ferdinand marcos said saturday that reported 
efforts by us officials to indict him for fraud are mere 
repetitions of charges pending in the philippines 
the los angeles times reported saturday that federal officials 
have overcome major legal obstacles in their case against the 
deposed philippines leader and likely would ask a federal grand 
jury to indict him 
i will not try to guess what the motivation is behind the 
possible federal indictment but as i have said in the past 
several times and so have my lawyers we can prove the charges are 
false and we have evidence to do so marcos responded through a 
spokesman 
marcos said 35 cases are filed in a philippines court involving 
billions of dollars allegedly misappropriated during and after his 
20year rule 
and so why is there an effort to file a similar case in the 
united states which are mere repetitions sic of charges pending 
in the philippines marcos asked 
the indictment is expected to deal only with alleged of 
wrongdoing after marcos left the philippines during a 
civilianmilitary revolt that swept corazon aquino to power in 
february 1986 the newspaper reported 
according to the report the investigation focuses on 
allegations that marcos and his wife imelda conspired with others 
to violate us district court injunctions by secretly transferring 
ownership of hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen art and 
manhattan real estate bought with philippine government funds

the election campign was generally low key with little 
controversy in both major primary races the democrats stressed 
their professional backgrounds and government experience in their 
appeal to voters 
the three democrats who sought to unseat saiki became known as 
the three amigos because of their general agreement on issues 
they aimed most of their criticism at the firstterm republican 
who gained some national exposure last month as the secretary of 
the republican national convention 
bornhorst is the frontrunner among the five democrats running 
for honolulu mayor according to a recent advertiserchannel 2 news 
poll she is also leading fasi in the poll for the general 
election but fasi was narrowing the gap and many voters were still 
undecided 
fasi served three terms as a democratic mayor but lost in the 
1980 primary he came back as a republican and won again in 1984 
souza gained headlines during the mayoral primary campaign when 
he was excluded from a debate because debate organizers said he 
had less than 1 percent of the vote in a poll 
matsunaga 71 was in washington for most of the primary 
campaign zimmerman gained some publicity for his lowbudget 
campaign when he was arrested for handing out pamphlets at a farm 
fair held on city property

while many lament the fires that have 
charred much of yellowstone national park a wilderness that went 
up in smoke just one year ago already displays lush and diverse 
greenery that attracts herds of elk 
the fire created more wildlife habitat than anything we could 
have ever done forest ranger morris huffman said of the deadwood 
summit fire in the frank churchriver of no return wilderness in 
the boise national forest 
the fire 250 miles west of yellowstone burned more than 50000 
acres during the summer of 1987 
its a natural mosaic now with open meadows and stands of 
timber said forest spokesman frank carroll a forest that was 
just getting older and deader has now been beautifully revived 
federal land managers rocked by criticism of their handsoff 
approach to dealing with naturally sparked wildfires in wilderness 
areas and parks point to deadwood summit as an example of a good 
burn its a tough sell 
fires this summer have charred more than 15 million acres in 
and around yellowstone an early decision to let the flames go 
unchecked within prescribed boundaries ignited a firestorm of 
controversy and interior secretary donald hodel has said a change 
is likely 
idaho gov cecil andrus a former interior secretary and others 
have called the let burn policy a prescription for disaster 
especially during the regions worst drought in decades 
but while the touristdependent communities surrounding 
yellowstone look with apprehension at changes nature will take 
generations to erase others say deadwood summit is and 
yellowstone will be an ecologically healthier place as a result of 
being burned 
when fire goes through an area and turns those trees into ash 
one of the things that happens is that the minerals the tree has 
captured during its life are returned to the soil said tracey 
trent chief of program coordination for the idaho department of 
fish and game that really increases the productivity of the soil 
for a number of years after the fire 
or as huffman puts it it doesnt take long before nature 
starts doing its thing 
the deadwood summit fire was started by lightning on aug 1 
1987 about 25 air miles east of cascade and three miles east of 
the frank church wilderness boundary 
the blaze was doused by rain and snow three months later after 
burning about 40000 acres inside the wilderness and 11500 acres 
elsewhere inside a 75mile perimeter 
the deadwood fire in some senses is an example of how the 
natural fire policy can be very successful carroll said even 
though it burned longer than we predicted and got much bigger than 
we predicted it actually was an outstanding fire from a 
forestmanagement standpoint 
today the burned acreage is virtually covered with grass and 
other forage brush is starting to return and the area provided 
summer range this year to as many or more elk than before the 
blaze officials said 
stacy gebhards regional supervisor for the state department of 
fish and game said he has received reports of 150 elk or more on 
some meadows thats good news for hunters and an archery season 
for elk is going on as usual this month with general elk hunting 
opening in the area later this fall 
before there were uniform stands of lodgepole pine like tree 
farms some of it infested with pine bark beetles like those that 
left thousands of acres of yellowstone timber dead and dry beneath 
the canopy the ground was relatively barren the smaller more 
succulent plant life crowded out by the trees 
now there is the kind of diversity sought in a wilderness by 
land managers who try to let nature manage itself 
plants like service berry and buck brush have adapted to fire 
over the centuries and some lodgepole pine cones wont release 
their seeds until theyre burned 
theres probably some pretty good arguments that maybe this 
year we should have done something different carroll said but 
the bottom line is nature heals itself

some women are finding that a boudoir photo makes 
the perfect gift for the boyfriend or husband who has everything 
at design studio chicago nancy binder a 39yearold insurance 
executive posed for a photographer while sprawled on a black 
leather sofa with an emptied bottle of dom perignon champagne and a 
black mink coat on the floor 
she was clad in high heels sheer nylon stockings garter belt 
and a black silk teddy with the straps hanging off her shoulders 
i was engaged to a man who literally had everything so for 
his birthday i got him this she said of the photos its 
completely opposite of my corporate image doing it was a fantasy 
for me something very personal 
i would recommend that any woman do it men too 
in the chicago area more than 30 studios offer boudoir 
photography soft sexy portraits to be given to boyfriends or 
husbands 
a 1986 industry survey indicated that boudoir photography was 
the fastest growing segment of the business 
its stylized photography a very intimate portrait of a 
woman said photographer daniel byrnes who took the shots of ms 
binder 
it also is definitely not a cheap gift 
byrnes who has done this sort of work for four years charges 
250 or more for a session other chicago photographers quote 
prices ranging from 150 to 500 
but the photographers can give customers their moneys worth 
mattresses or a strategically draped sheet can be used to hide 
fat after the shots are taken retouching can eliminate stretch 
marks facial puffiness and dark circles under the eyes 
we know how to make a woman look good byrnes said 
steve schnur a photographer at furia studios in chicago said 
customers sometimes ask him to duplicate a pinup picture or even a 
shot from the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar 
others just say make me look sexy make me look 10 years 
younger schnur said 
men have also started posing for their ladies and there is a 
trend toward portraits of couples 
paula ray 32 a chicago actress and model said she had her 
picture taken embracing her boyfriend in softly erotic poses 
posing with my boyfriend made it more personal than posing 
alone she said the pictures captured the way we are when 
were together 
but sometimes a boudoir photo is not the perfect gift 
sherri northrup a chicago writerpublicist said she paid 800 
for a series of color shots two years ago as a st valentines day 
present for her husband 
ms northrup now divorced said her husband hardly reacted 
he just kind of blew the whole thing off like it was no big 
deal she said i should have got divorced right then and 
there

alexander solzhenitsyn is a great writer whose 
works now banned in the soviet union should be made available in 
his native land a prominent soviet critic said in an interview 
published sunday 
the comments on the exiled nobel prize winner were made by 
natalya ivanova and printed in the moscow youth daily moskovsky 
komsomolets they were the most positive remarks on solzhenitsyn to 
appear in the official soviet press in recent memory and a further 
sign of an ongoing reassessment of his works 
solzhenitsyn who spent eight years in labor camps under 
dictator josef stalin wrote the gulag archipelago a 
voluminous study of the political repression and purges that marred 
stalins 29year reign under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
stalin and his legacy have been sharply criticized 
solzhenitsyn who won the nobel prize for literature in 1970 
was expelled from the soviet union in 1974 and stripped of his 
soviet nationality he now lives in cavendish vt and is a us 
citizen 
i consider that he is a very great writer ms ivanova was 
quoted as telling moskovsky komsomolets in a wideranging interview 
about contemporary soviet literature 
it is a great misfortune for our literature that the young 
generation has been deprived of the possibility of reading his 
books i hope that this abnormal situation will be corrected 
although the greater openness fostered by gorbachev has led to 
the publication of oncebanned works by boris pasternak mikhail 
bulgakov and other soviet authors solzhenitsyn has so far remained 
off limits 
the editor of the literary monthly novy mir has said he is 
negotiating for the rights to print solzhenitsyns novel cancer 
ward but a work such as the gulag triology which maintains 
that widescale political repression began in the soviet union 
under soviet founder vladimir i lenin is still at odds with 
official ideology which pins the blame on stalin 
ms ivanova whose literary criticism regularly appears in the 
weekly magazine ogonyok also said she believed solzhenitsyn should 
be given his soviet citizenship back

us sen spark matsunaga 71 had an easy time with his 
littleknown democratic opponent honolulu writer bob zimmerman 
matsunaga gathered 180853 votes or 82 percent to zimmermans 
27360 or 12 percent and faces libertarian candidate ken 
schooland in the general election 
sixterm us rep daniel akaka whose district includes 
outlying areas of oahu and the neighbor islands was unopposed in

their city council seats to run for mayor mink resigned her 
council seat two years ago when she mounted an unsuccessful 
campaign for governor 
there was little bad blood in the two major democratic primary 
races in fact the three democrats who sought to unseat saiki 
became known as the three amigos because of their reluctance to 
criticize each other and their general agreement on the issues

government experience in their appeal to voters 
bornhorst a 13year city council veteran is the frontrunner 
in the honolulu mayors race according to a recent honolulu 
advertiserchannel 2 news poll although she leads fasi in the poll 
for the general election fasi was narrowing the gap and many 
voters were still undecided 
fasi served three terms as a democratic mayor before losing in 
the 1980 primary he came back as a republican and won again in 
1984

michael dukakis had already begun to fire back at 
george bush before former aide john sasso rejoined his campaign 
but dukakis has become even more combative since his sharpened 
rhetoric bearing the stamp of the man he likens to a brother 
exiled from the campaign a year ago after admitting his role in 
the videotape that helped drive sen joseph biden from the 
presidential race sasso returned to dukakis side two weeks ago 
and the friends who gathered to welcome him back erupted in 
approval when he made a simple declaration 
there are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this 
campaign i will not shy away from pointing these contrasts out 
all signs since to borrow a favorite dukakis phrase indicate 
that sasso means it 
the return of dukakis longtime political alter ego came at a 
time when the democratic presidential nominee had lost the momentum 
he gained from his partys national convention and as he was being 
criticized for not responding aggressively to attacks from george 
bush and his fellow republicans 
garbage was what dukakis quickly had to say about the gop 
attacks then seeking to regain the offensive he took aim at bush 
and his running mate indiana sen dan quayle and audiences seemed 
to approve 
george bush has been around washington a long time but if he 
couldnt stand up to the ayatollah or say no to noriega how will 
he measure up to gorbachev dukakis said in a speech in chicago 
he then reminded his audience that three vice presidents have 
assumed the presidency within the memories of many voters said 
dukakis dan quayle is no gerald ford hes no lyndon johnson 
and he sure aint harry truman 
in dukakis speeches tone and at his campaign headquarters 
sassos stamp is obvious 
dukakis has been more feisty his staff invigorated and 
longoverdue channels of communication with jesse jackson and key 
members of congress established 
it was an important development that brought our team up to 
full strength and were delighted said kirk odonnell the 
former thomas p tip oneill aide who was brought in as a 
senior adviser to dukakis after sasso resigned last september i 
think first of all his relationship with the governor is very 
important but also his long experience in campaigns hes a 
wellrespected and deservedly so political strategist 
sasso was the architect of dukakis presidential bid turning 
his eye toward the white house even as dukakis campaigned for 
reelection as governor of massachusetts in 1986 
sasso assembled the team but was forced to leave it behind 
after admitting he had a role in the attack video showing 
delaware sen biden using the words of a british politician without 
attributing them reports based on the videotape and subsequent 
stories about plagiarism put biden out of the race but then 
stories about sassos involvement forced him from dukakis side 
but as dukakis campaign lost steam in august dukakis recalled 
his longtime sidekick for the stretch run of his selfdescribed 
marathon 
sasso whose title is vice chairman has kept a relatively low 
profile since returning and declined to be interviewed about his 
impact but other dukakis aides some speaking privately credited 
him with taking a number of steps to sharpen the campaigns message 
and focus 
hes gotten things moving said one aide who works closely 
with sasso the message is tightening up the events are 
tightened up to help focus on that message and the need to respond 
and respond quickly now has a higher priority here 
one example came in chicago just days after sassos return 
after antiabortion protesters disrupted his speech and became the 
campaign story of the day dukakis held an unscheduled meeting with 
reporters making sure he reclaimed a major part of the story 
dukakis aides were careful to avoid belittling susan estrich 
who replaced sasso as campaign manager a year ago they were 
unanimous in praising estrich for her stewardship in the tumultuous 
period after sasso resigned and for her handling of his return 
which has reduced her role in plotting strategy somewhat but also 
allowed her to do what many in the campaign believe she does best 
dissect issues 
its been a winwin situation a senior dukakis aide said 
one asset sasso brought with him was the power to win dukakis 
over odonnell for one was urging dukakis to respond 
aggressively to bushs attacks the cautious dukakis initially 
resisted and was just beginning to show signs of aggressiveness 
when sasso was called back in effect an admission by dukakis that 
it was time to turn up the heat 
michael listens to john in a way he doesnt listen to 
others said one of the aides who commented only on condition he 
not be named 
sasso also has extensive contacts in democratic circles from his 
1984 job as manager of geraldine ferraros vice presidential 
campaign 
estrich was his deputy then and both were involved in the 
decision to ask washington attorney bob barnett who played george 
bush in ferraros debate rehearsals to play the same role this 
week as dukakis begins in earnest his preparations for his first 
debate with bush

blame it on long campaign days with multiple 
stops jet lag or whatever bloopers are becoming a standard 
feature of george bushs stump speeches 
you ought to vote for me i knew about pearl harbor three 
months before it happened bush joked last week trying to take 
the edge off his mistake about the date of the japanese attack that 
led america into world war ii he had said it was on sept 7 
instead of dec 7 
since that foulup it seems that bush slips in every speech 
i hope i stand for antibigotry antisemitism antiracism 
bush said in one that is what drives me later bush sent his 
press secretary out to make sure reporters knew he did not mean to 
say he stands for antisemitism 
tripping over his oftstated goal of full employment the 
republican presidential nominee said he wanted to ensure that 
everybody who has a job wants a job 
usually candidates dont try to improvise on the pledge of 
allegiance but thats what bush aides say he was doing at an 
appearance last week after reporters suggested he had stumbled over 
the words 
bush who has tried to wrap his campaign in patriotism said the 
flag was the symbol of the united states of america and then 
continued and to the liberty for which it stands one nation 
under god with freedom and justice for all and lets never forget 
it 
if he was trying to use the words of the pledge he should have 
said and to the republic for which it stands one nation under 
god indivisible with liberty and justice for all 
on the same day he referred back to january 1981 when he was 
sworn in with president reagan 
giving himself a promotion bush said ten days before i was 
sworn in as president 
in california with gov george deukmejian at his side bush 
apparently forgot that reagan had been a twoterm governor of the 
state referring to deukmejian bush said he will go down in my 
book as the great governor of california 
in san francisco bush tried to poke holes in michael dukakis 
boasts about the economy in massachusetts inadvertently he gave 
dukakis some campaign ammunition by incorrectly stating the record 
his speech text said that massachusetts under dukakis had lost 
26000 manufacturing jobs and was one of the biggest 
manufacturing job losers in america but thats not the way bush 
said it 
reading from a device that scrolled his speech in front of his 
eyes bush dropped the word manufacturing in two separate 
references dukakis staff pounced on bush because although the 
state has lost manufacturing jobs it has added about 230000 jobs 
overall 
over breakfast at a mexican restaurant in los angeles bush made 
three gaffes in a matter of minutes 
he said his mexicanborn daughterinlaw became a citizen so 
she could vote for her grandfather her uh fatherinlaw 
he referred to republican rep manuel lujan as a congressman 
from mexico not new mexico and he referred to the oldtime 
dragnet television series character joe friday as senator 
before he corrected it to sergeant 
bush said last week that when he makes a mistake hes fair game 
for attack by dukakis and vice versa 
well foul up and hell jump on me and hell make some 
mistakes and ill jump on him but the thing is to get the issues 
out there so the american people can see them 
once in a while you do get sore once in a while you might get 
a little tense but you know when you make a mistake like that i 
expect somebody to jump on me bob hope did it it didnt bother 
me johnny carson did it and that didnt bother me 
bush also acknowledged that some staff members didnt want him 
to meet with reporters one reason being his occasional gaffes 
its just some lower level handwringers who think im going 
to screw up he said

from the turret of an abrams tank in michigan 
to a union hall in republican orange county calif michael 
dukakis fought all last week to regain the initiative in the 
presidential race 
it was really a good week he told reporters on the long 
flight saturday night from california to the nations capital 
a good week had been a long time coming 
aides to the democratic presidential candidate readily conceded 
the race had changed dramatically during the past month with 
george bush enjoying a surge 
gone were those doubledigit leads dukakis once held in national 
polls gone also was the sense some had had that he was a near 
certain bet to win back the white house for the democrats 
presidential campaigns can turn on which candidate is more 
successful at setting the issues agenda and defining the public 
perception of the contenders 
for the past month voters have learned more about dukakis from 
republican bush and his allies than they did from the democratic 
candidate 
they have received a picture of a northeast liberal who vetoed 
legislation to require recitation of the pledge of allegiance in 
public schools of a governor who supported allowing convicts to 
have weekend furloughs from prison of someone who opposed most 
major weapons systems 
the past week dukakis set out to alter that image to sharpen 
the message as his aides put it 
he sought to counter the charge that he is weak on defense by 
riding in the turret of a tank and by delivering a speech decidedly 
hawkish for dukakis in tone 
the emphasis in his speech at georgetown university was on the 
weapons systems he favors the trident ii the stealth bomber a 
new fighter and a new attack submarine 
then he flew to california where the emphasis was on fighting 
crime and drugs as well as on the environment 
his speeches contained more specifics doubling the number of 
drug enforcement agents and elevating the environmental protection 
agency to cabinet status 
it was clear the dukakis campaign had decided it was time to 
make clear what he stands for 
in most of the country voters dont know who mike dukakis 
is said francis obrien a senior campaign adviser 
no one summed that up better than george bush the week before 
the republican national convention when he dubbed dukakis the 
stealth candidate a reference to the experimental plane 
designed to evade radar detection 
it was a jibe at a candidate who had avoided laying out specific 
proposals on many major questions and had directed his party to 
come up with a nonspecific platform 
for those who saw democrats unduly burdened by past promises to 
a variety of interest groups dukakis strategy seemed right 
but as the fall campaign opened it gave the republicans an 
opportunity to be the first to give voters a picture of dukakis 
suddenly the talk within the dukakis campaign was of the need 
for a good solid message 
it would have been better had he spoken up a little more 
sharply a little sooner said tony podesta who is running the 
dukakis campaign in california 
the republican attacks were relentless and at most stops dukakis 
found himself pressed to respond he often resisted reluctant to 
get into extended negative campaigning 
but he couldnt remain silent 
we cant let them we cant let bush and his aides lay charges 
on us that we dont answer said obrien 
while he sometimes appeared reluctant to respond to the vice 
president dukakis was not shy about going on the attack 
he repeatedly linked bush to manuel noriega whom dukakis always 
describes as the drugpeddling panamanian dictator and said the 
vice president had provided zero protection for the environment 
dukakis sense that he was having a good week was helped by the 
reports of rhetorical gaffes by bush and his running mate dan 
quayle 
dan quayle doesnt know what century hes in and george bush 
cant remember the pledge of allegiance he told a delighted 
partisan crowd in california

remember president reagans nationally 
televised pledge last january to veto future catchall spending 
bills like the 600 billion behemoth congress sent him last year 
and the promises by scores of lawmakers from both parties not to do 
it again 
guess what may be about to happen 
as the oct 1 start of the 1989 fiscal year approaches 
increasing numbers of senators and representatives and their 
aides concede that an omnibus spending bill looms as a real 
possibility 
it wouldnt be as large as last years after all two of the 13 
individual appropriations bills that finance the government have 
already been signed into law and four others have been sent to 
reagan for his signature 
but with the presidential campaign influencing much of what 
happens in washington these days and with the hopper stuffed with 
legislation congress wants to pass before leaving town next month 
a catchall spending bill may well be the result 
i dont see any way out of that scenario right now sen ted 
stevens of alaska a ranking republican on the appropriations 
committee said recently 
everyone agrees that come oct 1 a shortterm omnibus bill is 
virtually unavoidable providing financing for a week or two for 
all agencies for which money has not yet been provided for the new 
fiscal year 
but if spending legislation is not finished by the time congress 
adjourns in midoctober lawmakers would likely either pass another 
omnibus bill to tide the government over until congress returns in 
january or send the president a package of all remaining 
appropriations bills and dare him to veto it 
the engine that would drive such a measure would be defense 
reagan has already vetoed a pentagon budget bill containing arms 
control language and cuts in the star wars missile defense 
system a rejection that was interpreted as an effort to make 
defense an issue in the presidential campaign 
many lawmakers still support those provisions if congress and 
the white house cannot work out a compromise or if they send a 
measure to reagan and he vetoes it again a catchall bill would be 
born consisting of the defense spending bill and other unsigned 
measures 
there could be a situation if we run into a problem on the 
defense appropriations bill in which there would have to be a 
continuing resolution in the final analysis senate majority 
leader robert byrd dwva using the congressional term for 
catchall spending legislation warned his colleagues two weeks ago 
rep vic fazio dcalif a member of both the house budget and 
appropriations committees said reagan thinks hes created an 
issue they may figure they can rekindle it by vetoing an 
appropriations bill 
some democrats say one scenario would be to send the president a 
package of bills containing the defense legislation and other 
spending measures thus making it painful for the president to 
exercise a veto and eliminating another opportunity for republicans 
to raise the defense issue 
he threw us a curve by vetoing that defense bill said rep 
les aucoin dore a member of the defense appropriations 
subcommittee no one down pennsylvania avenue should be surprised 
if we use every strategy in the book to launch that curve out of 
the ballpark 
however congress democratic leadership has vowed repeatedly 
this year to try to send reagan 13 separate spending bills by the 
oct 1 start of the fiscal year 
few lawmakers have forgotten the presidents state of the union 
address of jan 25 when he hoisted thick stacks of spending and 
tax bills that were months overdue and said congress shouldnt 
send another one of these and if you do i will not sign it 
reagan accused lawmakers of trying to force him to accept 
excessive spending while congress blamed the president for being 
so intractable for so long that lawmakers had no other choice 
nonetheless dozens of senators and representatives signed letters 
chastising the use of omnibus spending bills a belief that many 
retain 
they make congress as an institution look bad says rep 
timothy penny dminn a perennial opponent of omnibus spending 
measures 
for his part the president is standing firm on his words of 
last january 
i hope congress will watch my lips here i want 13 separate 
bills he said friday 
whatever happens that congress has gotten even this far is a 
remarkable feat for an institution that is a notorious budget 
laggard 
the house passed all 13 appropriations bills this year before 
july 1 the first time that had happened since 1960 congress 
hasnt approved all 13 appropriations bills separately since fiscal 
1977

barry goldwater says hes enjoying the quiet 
life in retirement sitting in the arizona sun and watching the 
robins on his windowsill but his mind of late has been back in 
washington reliving past battles on the potomac 
what he remembers isnt at all flattering to those who served 
with him and what he sees for the future isnt always reassuring 
barry goldwater as always is still speaking bluntly 
at age 79 goldwater has written another book reflecting on his 
30year career as a united states senator his 1964 republican 
presidential bid and the people and events he encountered along 
the way goldwater written with jack casserly will be 
published by doubleday on oct 12 
nostalgia for the old days and other times rises like the sun 
most of my mornings goldwater says but in the evening when 
the cool desert air refreshes my spirit my blood flows faster and 
i shake my fist at the present 
considering his outspoken words goldwater must have written 
most of his book in the evening with his blood flowing neither 
democrats nor republicans are spared 
president reagan i believe reagan did know of the diversion 
of iranian funds to the contras he had to know the white house 
explanation makes him out to be either a liar or incompetent 
senate republican leader bob dole dole doesnt have the 
leadership qualities that his job as minority leader requires he 
tries to make everybody happy that cant be done i and other 
republicans were unable to harden his hide the kansas senator must 
become tough if he is ever to become a leader 
senate democratic leader robert byrd one day i see bob byrd 
on the senate floor and didnt recognize him his face was covered 
with pancake makeup that ran down his starched collar his hair was 
stylishly fluffed he looked like he was about to step on stage in 
some nightclub act i took one look walked back to my seat sat 
down and waited for him to pull out his fiddle 
president nixon richard nixon was the most dishonest 
individual i have ever met in my life he lied to his wife his 
family his friends his colleagues in the congress lifetime 
members of his own political party the american people and the 
world 
election junkies will be disappointed if they expect similar 
observations on the candidates in this years presidential 
election fellow senators lloyd bentson and dan quayle the 
democratic and republican vice presidential nominees are not 
discussed at all the name george bush appears one fleeting time 
michael dukakis not at all 
goldwater however has something to say about the democratic 
and republican parties as they head into the november elections 
democrats are rethinking the fundamental meaning of 
liberalism and simply have no new direction or programs to use in 
redirecting their energies looking beyond 1988 the democrats 
will come back strong about the year 2000 or shortly thereafter 
but it will be a new democratic party largely because of reagan 
republicans dont have to become more centrist but its 
certain the gop has to accommodate and balance a wider variety of 
opinions and political options we must become more a party of 
inclusion 
referring to the new right and its moral agenda goldwater said 
we began walking separate roads however when the new right 
began pushing special social agendas involving legitimate legal 
religious and other differences i support much of what they say 
but not at the risk of compromising constitutional rights 
despite criticism of the irancontra scandal and reagans 
choices of adm john poindexter as national security adviser and 
donald regan to be his white house chief of staff goldwater calls 
reagan the most inspirational president i have seen edging out 
john f kennedy who inspired the nation 
goldwater is less inspired by the growing federal and 
congressional bureaucracies the colossus we continue to 
construct in washington is now being threatened from within he 
says the large staffs created to help congress are now beginning 
to control it ive long asked the question who the hell is 
running congress we or the staffs 
while goldwater is optimistic that the world will solve problems 
of population hunger and disease he says communism is the 
worlds greatest danger and the seeds of future global conflict 
have unmistakably already been sown a third world war is not 
unthinkable 
for 51 of his nearly 80 years barry goldwater drew support from 
his wife peggy who died in 1985 and he remembers her with pain 
and poignancy in the book dedicated simply to peggy 
after her death i phoned her four or five times every day for 
months after returning to washington the phone would ring and 
ring then her memory would fall away and my face would collapse 
into my hands the healing process has been slow and painful 
if the title hadnt already been taken for a book about harry 
truman goldwater could have called his book plain speaking as 
he says at the beginning these recollections are straight from 
the shoulder a last salute before the flag is lowered and the 
final notes of taps fade into memory a man stands up says his 
piece then sits down others must judge his deeds

nearly three out of four juveniles in youth 
correctional facilities come from broken homes and nearly half were 
under the influence of drugs or alcohol when they committed their 
offense a government study reported sunday

eight boxes of correspondence and memos 
from the peoples temple commune at jonestown guyana where 913 
people died in a mass suicide 10 years ago have become available 
for scholarly review 
among the documents are dozens of scribbled notes from members 
suggesting methods of taking revenge on people who defected from 
the group proposals that included selling them poisoned christmas 
candy 
the records unsealed by a courtappointed receiver and 
deposited recently at the california historical society in san 
francisco reveal the bizarre mental states of members of the 
peoples temple 
in a group of letters to the rev jim jones leader of the 
religious cult and mastermind of the suicide on nov 18 1978 some 
members vowed to kill themselves and their children on command 
jones aides wrote memos to him on how sleep deprivation and 
vitamin b complex deficiency are useful tools in brainwashing 
after a suicide drill at the jungle settlement one member 
wrote to jones 
sex drugs nor wine could take what took place this evening 
i am so grateful to have had the opportunity to go through the 
process of dying just sitting there looking at the line of people 
young and old alike eager to get it over with i thought of how 
nice it would be 
most members of the commune swallowed grape drink laced with 
potassium cyanide a short time after rep leo ryan a san francisco 
examiner photographer two nbc reporters and a temple defector were 
killed by supporters of jones in a hail of gunfire at the communes 
air strip 
poison was squirted down the throats of children 
the new documents also reveal that jones wife marceline 
challenged him during the summer of 1978 when talk of mass suicide 
became a temple obsession she pleaded with him in a letter to 
spare the children 
one woman said she would kill herself if jones whom she called 
father wanted it 
but she added that she still wanted to write some short 
stories even poetry plant rows of vegetables and i would like 
to raise a kitten

a majority of americans favor financial 
assistance for family planning programs in rapidly growing nations 
according to a new poll done for a pair of population groups 
sixty percent of adults polled by louis harris and associates 
said the united states should fund foreign family planning 
programs regardless of whether abortion is legal in those nations 
but more than onethird of americans 34 percent disagreed 
according to the poll prepared for the population crisis committee 
and the planned parenthood federation of america 
providing financial support for family planning has been a bone 
of contention in recent years with the agency for international 
development withdrawing support from countries where abortion is a 
part of the programs 
the agency halted funding to both the international planned 
parenthood federation and the united nations population fund 
contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion 
the two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1250 
americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in this 
presidential election year a poll of that size has a margin of 
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
the study concluded that americans are aware that the worlds 
population which last year topped the 5 billion mark is growing 
rapidly and that this poses many problems 
some 91 percent of those polled think food shortages and famines 
will get worse if populations in poor countries continue their 
rapid increases the study found 
continued population growth will lead to more illegal 
immigration to the united states according to 89 percent of the 
respondents while 87 percent predicted that there will be more 
international crises and that more agricultural land will turn to 
desert and 69 percent foresee more us jobs moving overseas 
asked if the poor countries of latin america africa and asia 
should have strong birth control programs 89 percent agreed 
fiftynine percent said such programs are in the united states 
interest and 60 percent approved us money for the programs

nearly four years after radon from his 
house caused stanley watras to set off radiation detectors at the 
limerick nuclear power plant he wonders daily about his familys 
health 
theres a fine line between making yourself sick by worrying 
and having a genuine concern and doing the best you can said 
watras 37 a technical adviser at the plant 
radon levels in watras home of 800 times the concentration 
deemed hazardous first alerted environmental officials and 
residents of southeastern pennsylvania to the danger of indoor 
radon concentration last week the head of the environmental 
protection agency said the problem is more widespread than 
previously believed and urged that every home in the country be 
tested 
radon is a radioactive gas produced by the natural decaying of 
uranium found in all soil and rock and usually dissipated 
harmlessly into the atmosphere it poses a health threat when it 
seeps through the ground and collects in homes 
the colorless odorless gas could be responsible for 20000 of 
the nations 130000 annual lung cancer deaths the epa estimates 
it kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the lung 
irradiating the organs for a lifetime 
environmental officials first believed radon to be concentrated 
along a geological formation known as the reading prong a narrow 
area of highuranium soil stretching from reading pa across 
northern new jersey into new york state 
but a recent epa survey in seven states and indian land found 
healththreatening levels of radon in 29 percent of 11000 homes 
tested 
the epa has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as a 
guideline for determining when longterm exposure poses a health 
threat a picocurie is a measure of radiation exposure to 15 
picocuries of radon for a lifetime is equivalent to smoking a pack 
of cigarettes a day the epa says 
a reading taken in the living room of watras modest 
splitlevel house in december 1984 was 3200 picocuries the 
highest ever recorded at a private home watras his wife and two 
young children were evacuated soon afterward 
tim hartman administrator of the state radon monitoring program 
set up several miles away in late 1985 said the watrases house 
was built inches above uraniumladen granite 
he just had an ungodly concentration of radon spewing into his 
home hartman said 
watras and his family returned to the house in august 1985 after 
a 32600 research project dramatically reduced the radon level 
watras and his wife have since had a third child 
at the beginning we were saying why us we were looking at 
the children saying what did we do to you watras recalled in 
an interview at his home last week 
watras now believes god put his family in the home for a purpose 
what weve got to do from now on is try to help other 
people he said calling his efforts to bring attention to radon 
a crusade 
some of the other residents in his suburban berks county 
neighborhood nicknamed radon hills agree with him and have 
organized to push for legislation protecting homes from the toxic 
gas others believe the threat is overblown 
kay jones who lives down the street from watras is president 
of pennsylvanians against radon a group with about 150 members 
ms jones believes national building codes should include radon 
guidelines wants public service advertisements that warn people 
about the danger of radon and supports a law that would force a 
family to leave a home when radon levels reach a certain point 
unless the government acts people will forget about radon as 
media interest wanes she said 
right now everything you pick up its radon radon radon 
but in two or three days its going to die out ms jones said 
dennis hess another neighbor is one of those skeptical about 
the radon threat 
i dont think im walking into a gas chamber when i walk into 
my home id like to think something else will get me before the 
radon said hess a 34yearold machinist at a chemical plant 
hess hasnt measured the radon level in his home and he said 
environmental officials havent been able to convince him that the 
problem cant be alleviated by opening a few windows 
no records exist of the number of people who have had their 
homes refitted in pennsylvania to reduce the amount of radon in the 
air hartman estimated the number was in the thousands most of 
them along the reading prong where 60 percent of the homes tested 
had levels above 4 picocuries 
even when houses have been fixed health worries remain 
the fear never goes away said ms jones whose family spent 
five years in a home that recorded a radon level of 450 picocuries 
before being fitted with a ventilation system were living in 
the unknown

sen william proxmire awarded his latest 
golden fleece award to the urban mass transit administration for 
sending government officials to disney world to learn how to 
motivate employees his office said sunday 
the september installment of the wisconsin democrats monthly 
award for wasteful federal spending was for a fourday seminar that 
cost the agency 68160 
umta apparently hopes that by sending mass transit officials 
from around the country to disney world minnie mouse goofy snow 
white and the seven dwarfs will help them find out how to make 
transit employees whistle while they work proxmire said in a 
written statement 
attending the sept 69 session in orlando fla were six top 
umta officials including its chief alfred a dellibovi and 47 
local mass transit officials from around the country the officials 
paid their own travel expenses but umta picked up the tab for the 
110 per night hotel rooms and the 795 program fee for each 
this is an idea dopey would have loved but its likely to 
make taxpayers feel like grumpy the senator said 
umta spokesman james bynum said friday that agency officials are 
worried that only 28 per cent of all travel by americans is made 
on mass transit the lowest percentage since the government began 
making the estimate 20 years ago 
bynum said the trip served two purposes to allow officials to 
learn how disney world officials motivate their workers and to 
examine the amusement parks huge transportation system both would 
provide helpful lessons for agencies trying to boost ridership he 
said 
it was a perfectly legitimate effort to convince public 
transit authorities that there are ways to attract new riders 
bynum said government would do well to draw on the experience of 
successful private companies 
the seminar called the disney approach to people 
management was also attended by executives from private 
industry bynum said 
proxmire however said he doubted that allowing government 
officials to frolic in the magic kingdom with federal dollars 
would prove helpful 
instead of a trip to disney world maybe mass transit 
officials can improve employee morale by wearing mickey mouse ears 
around bus yards he said it would cost far less and it would 
probably accomplish as much as this wasteful trip

the prime ministers office once planted a false 
story that prince charles would marry princess marieastrid of 
luxembourg to catch a senior political source leaking information 
to the press a new book says 
the false information was leaked 11 years ago with the 
connivance of special branch the arm of scotland yard that handles 
political security and with the assent of charles parents queen 
elizabeth ii and prince philip according to the real charles 
to be published monday 
author alan hamilton a senior journalist at the times of 
london said the source had upset the prime ministers office and 
buckingham palace by feeding a stream of highgrade accurate 
political gossip to john warden then political editor of the 
daily express 
the suspected source was fed an inaccurate but just about 
plausible account that charles would marry marieastrid a roman 
catholic the book says in fact the two scarcely knew each other 
the planted story claimed that any sons of the marriage would be 
raised as anglicans but that daughters would be brought up as 
catholics hamilton says the british monarch is head of the state 
church of england and by law roman catholics are barred from 
succeeding to the throne 
the story appeared on the front page of the express under the 
headline charles to marry astrid official 
the source was then confronted confessed his guilt and 
discreetly retired hamilton says 
the sunday telegraph quoted warden as denying a trap was set it 
quoted him as saying his information for the story came from a 
politician with extremely good royal connections who had correctly 
tipped him the previous year that princess margaret the queens

when presidential candidate michael dukakis 
addresses hispanic voters in their own language cables news 
network can broadcast his words untranslated on its new 
spanishlanguage program 
the language spoken by oneeighth of the us population has 
become part of the daily newsroom hum at the headline news studios 
in atlanta as cnn enters its fourth month of producing noticiero 
telemundocnn 
its a very ambitious undertaking for cnn to have gotten 
into said the programs executive producer marlene may and 
theyre going full steam ahead its sort of like the skys the 
limit right now 
the twicedaily halfhour newscast premiered in may with 
onscene coverage of the moscow summit 
it is the first time a major enlishlanguage news organization 
has entered the growing spanishlanguage television market 
but cnns spanish product is shown in this country on 18 
spanishlanguage stations owned by or affiliated with telemundo 
group inc a spanish network based in new york 
cnn also sold the program in eight latin american countries 
its main competitor is the newscast produced by univision 
holdings inc a spanishlanguage broadcast system that has been 
around for some 25 years 
the 25member bilingual staff shares cnns headline news studio 
in atlanta and has access to the cable networks englishlanguage 
news gathering resources worldwide 
the resources of 1600 cnn employees around the world are 
available for them to use in spanish if they choose said steve 
hayworth spokesman for the atlantabased cnn 
however may stresses that the newscast is not just a 
translation of cnns english product 
weve hired our own journalists everything from editors to 
writers to anchors to reporters she said theres not a 
translator on my staff 
numbering more than 20 million hispanic americans have become 
the fastest growing minority market in the country among the half 
who understand english more than 50 percent still spend most of 
their time watching spanishlanguage television according to a 
survey cited in the trade journal televisionradio age 
advertisers spent 223 million on spanishlanguage television 
last year up 23 percent from 1986 and nearly double the 118 
million spent in 1984 the journal reported 
there is obviously an important and large and affluent 
marketplace of spanishspeaking americans hayworth said 
though cnn hasnt been on the air very long in spanish may said 
shes pleased with the results of its first summer 
were ecstatic about the fact that weve kept up our audience 
share and ratings in new york she said adding that the program 
also has been doing well in miami and los angeles other cities 
with large hispanic populations 
we try to do stories that we feel would really affect the 
hispanics most things related to health children education 
the dropout rate is a major problem among hispanics said may a 
native of cuba 
jorge gestoso a coanchor of the program said its important 
for hispanic journalists to see world events through the eyes of 
their audience 
when we covered the republican national convention we tried 
to focus on how what they were saying could affect the lives of 
hispanics said gestoso who was born in uruguay 
its vital its essential to have spanish language news the 
audience is very different at least a portion of them speak only 
spanish or very little english he said theres a vital need 
to let them understand whats going on in the world

when their party regained control of the 
senate two years ago liberal democrats placed at the top of their 
agenda raising a minimum wage that president reagan claimed had 
caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the great 
depression 
with only seven weeks remaining until voters pick reagans 
successor his former running mate and gopdesignated heir george 
bush may have waffled just enough on the issue in the past two 
weeks for democrats to push through the first increase in the 335 
an hour wage base in eight years 
labor department figures indicate that a raise to 455 by 1991 
as proposed by senate democrats would directly benefit some 15 
million workers now paid less than that amount 
bush said again last friday that he could support a modest 
increase less than the 120 an hour over three years that 
democrats have agreed upon but only if it is coupled with a lower 
training wage 
key senate republicans such as pete domenici of new mexico 
predicted that bushs slight shift to muted support for a wage 
increase will cause many gop lawmakers to reconsider their 
opposition with or without the training wage 
the training wage is the latest republican euphemism for a 
subminimum wage a reagan idea that went nowhere when the 
administration proposed it year after year during his first term 
but that succeeded in taking the steam out of a push for an minimum 
wage increase 
to quote bushs running mate sen dan quayle rind 
paraphrasing indiana university basketball coach bobby knight 
there is nothing that a good defense cannot beat a better 
offense in other words a good offense wins 
but with the senate expected to complete action on the minimum 
wage this week followed by house action the next week bush quayle 
and congressional republicans are stuck on defense 
the latest gallup poll on the issue on june 19 showed 76 percent 
public support for raising the minimum wage by 50 percent to 505 
over the next four years with only 28 percent opposition even 
republicans who were polled favored the raise by 67 percent to 30 
percent 
the raise to 505 over four years is the house democratic 
version of massachusetts democrat edward m kennedys increase to 
455 over three years in the senate house leaders already have 
indicated they will abandon their proposal in favor of the senate 
version 
as a republican counter quayle who has led the senate 
opposition to a minimum wage increase the past 7 years in july 
offered a 65cent raise over two years to 4 an hour coupled with 
a lower training wage 
republicans however declined to push for a vote on quayles 
amendment in the senate labor and human resources committee then 
saying they preferred to wage the battle on the senate floor 
while bush and the republican campaign have declined to specify 
what they want in a minimum wage package sen rudy boschwitz 
rminn said he will introduce quayles 4 minimum wage as an 
amendment this week 
and sen orrin hatch rutah has a pending amendment on the 
senate floor to establish a training wage that would pay any 
new hire 80 percent of the minimum wage for the first 90 days he or 
she is on an employers payroll 
but because democrats control the senate hatchs proposal may 
never get a direct vote kennedy offered a substitute that would 
slightly expand coverage of an 85 percent subminimum wage 
currently 285 an hour for fulltime students that is now in the 
law about 100000 students are paid that subminimum 
if kennedys parliamentary gambit works and a majority supports 
his subminimum proposal republicans may be precluded from ever 
getting a yeaornea vote on their training wage 
hatch expressed doubts last week that he would prevail but with 
many lawmakers in both parties taking last friday off to campaign 
for reelection he succeeded in delaying any votes until at least 
tuesday when presumably all will have returned 
kennedy meanwhile welcomed bushs vague support for any kind 
of minimum wage increase 
i only wish that he had spoken up sooner kennedy said 
returning to his where was george theme at the democratic 
national convention i must say that his silence has been 
deafening during debate on this bill 
meanwhile the senate is scheduled to vote monday evening on a 
uscanada trade agreement that would phase out all tariffs 
between the two countries over 10 years 
the house in august approved the agreement negotiated by the 
reagan administration but its anticipated passage by the senate 
and then signature by the president does not mean that it will go 
into effect soon 
the bill authorizes reagan to implement the agreement next jan 
1 but it has been approved by only one of canadas two legislative 
bodies 
if canadian prime minister brain mulroney as expected calls 
new parliamentary elections in the next two or three weeks 
legislation there implementing the accord could die in canadas 
senate a new parliament would then have to start from scratch on 
enacting the agreement

one week before their highstakes debate george bush and 
michael dukakis took sunday off before heading into a week of 
reduced campaigning amid intense preparation for their first 
televised confrontation before a national audience 
bush in brief remarks to reporters in washington said hed 
done all the homework for the debate but still planned to work 
later in the week on preparing for it 
dukakis who was out of the public eye in boston also planned 
to ease off on his recently fullspeed campaign travels later in 
the week to concentrate on getting ready for the debate 
meanwhile sen george mitchell of maine a topranking senate 
democrat defended the partys nominee against recent attacks by 
bush and other republicans 
in particular mitchell took the republicans to task for their 
criticism of dukakis veto of massachusetts legislation that would 
have required teachers to lead classes in the pledge of allegiance 
there is no greater phony issue thats been raised in this 
campaign mitchell said on abcs this week with david 
brinkley he said in america the pledge means something 
because we say it freely we are not forced to do so 
rep lynn martin of illinois a cochairwoman of the national 
bush campaign criticized mitchell for linking the issue to loyalty 
oaths in nazi germany and the soviet union she said such comments 
show why the issue is working against michael dukakis and 
should 
as for next sundays debate in winstonsalem nc the first of 
two presidential confrontations before the nov 8 election bush 
said i think ive done the homework its like a ballgame 
getting up for it mentally up and physically up 
the vice president speaking with reporters after attending 
church services said he planned to work this week on preparing for 
the debate but not today its sunday a day off im going to 
get a little exercise and count my blessings 
monday morning campaign appearances in the philadelphia area a 
tuesday visit to a flag manufacturing company in new jersey and a 
joint appearance with president reagan on thursday in texas were 
bushs only scheduled trips for the week 
the vice president said he didnt expect to visit areas in 
southern texas damaged by hurricane gilbert he said of the 
hurricane its a sad thing fortunately it was less strong when 
it hit but still there is a lot of heartache 
dukakis who spent most of last week on the road giving major 
speeches on foreign and military policy also planned to 
concentrate on getting ready for the debate during the coming week 
still the massachusetts governor who returned home only 
saturday night was to embark on a campaign trip to texas on monday 
the vice presidential running mates democrat lloyd bentsen and 
republican dan quayle also were off the campaign trail on sunday 
bush who attended services at st johns church an episcopal 
church on lafayette square across from the white house with his 
wife barbara answered several questions afterward 
asked about the military coup in haiti he said its too 
early to say what happened but he added we want democracy for 
haiti for the whole of the caribbean and for the whole of central 
america 
he said such a trend appears to be occurring in latin america 
with some visible exceptions 
asked if he favored a resumption of talks with panamas leader 
gen manuel noriega bush would say only we want democracy in 
panama as well as through the rest of the region 
on another television talk program lee m thomas administrator 
of the environmental protection agency said bush had asked him on 
two occasions if more could be done to fight acid rain than was 
called for by reagan administration policies 
thomas on nbcs meet the press said at least twice 
individually with me he pulled me aside on the issue of acid rain 
and asked if we could do more and frankly at that point in time 
i didnt think we should than where we were going on that 
problem he did not say when the inquiries occurred 
in the campaign bush has said i am an environmentalist 
and has said there were many occasions when he argued within the 
councils of the administration for more environmental protection 
he says he will back a program to reduce emissions of one major raw 
material for acid rain sulfur dioxide from smokestacks by 
unspecified millions of tons 
thomas has supported the administrations position that not 
enough is known about the effects of acid rain to justify a major 
emissions reduction program and that more research is needed 
dukakis on saturday said he would elevate epa to the status of a 
cabinet department 
meanwhile a new poll suggested bush has overtaken dukakis in 
ohio a key state in which dukakis had once led by 10 percentage 
points 
the university of akron poll commissioned by the akron beacon 
journal wkyctv in cleveland and wcmhtv in columbus indicated 
that 43 percent of the registered voters checked in the survey 
favored bush to 39 percent for dukakis and 18 percent undecided 
bushs lead was within the polls margin of potential sampling 
error four points in either direction 
the poll was conducted by telephone among 667 registered voters 
between sept 6 and last thursday

walter p chrysler jr an art collector and 
museum benefactor whose father founded chrysler corp has died of 
cancer at the age of 79 
chrysler who died saturday at sentara norfolk general hospital 
divided his time between new york city and norfolk hometown of his 
wife jean he had devoted much of his life to building a 
multimilliondollar art collection that is housed at the chrysler 
museum in norfolk 
the chrysler museum and the commonwealth have lost a great 
friend and patron museum director david steadman said sunday 
mr chrysler was a rare collector whose encyclopedic interests 
distinguished him from others 
he purchased his first work of art a renoir for 350 at age 
14 but the painting a landscape with an inchhigh nude drew the 
disapproval of a teacher at the hotchkiss school in connecticut 
where chrysler was a student 
the corridor master thought it unbecoming for young men to 
have such paintings chrysler said in a 1980 interview so he 
busted it over his knee and threw it in the trash can 
later at dartmouth university chrysler founded an arts magazine 
with another student senior nelson rockefeller 
he went against trends buying paintings by asyet unrecognized 
artists in the 1970s he sold a picasso for 16 million that he 
had bought 30 years earlier for 450 
the first chrysler museum was in provincetown mass in 1970 
chrysler agreed to move the collection to norfolk after the city 
offered to rename its museum for him and add a wing as well as 
naming a concert hall at scope for him 
since then the collection has grown in size value and 
reputation it was called one of the top 20 in the country by the 
wall street journal and has an 8000piece glass collection one of 
the finest in the world 
in addition to his art collecting in 1934 chrysler founded the 
airtemp division of chrysler which developed the first air 
conditioning system on wheels 
chrysler is survived by several nieces and nephews 
a memorial service will be held tuesday at the church of the 
good shepherd in norfolk burial will be wednesday in the family 
plot in tarrytown ny

investigators from the state parole office were able to identify 
dechirico from information obtained from witnesses and street 
sources he said 
dechirico arrested nine times since 1966 on charges including 
robbery drug possession grand larceny and burglary had been out 
on parole since december 1986 after serving 13 years for 
manslaughter charge in a 1973 killing police said 
he is a local crack addict who spends a lot of time on the 
street prestia said at a news conference we believe the 
robbery was for the purpose of getting money for drugs 
we were looking for him spotted him and he was taken into 
custody without incident the police official said 
dechirico was charged with seconddegree murder robbery 
criminal possession of a dangerous weapon and criminal possession 
of stolen property prestia said dechirico was charged with the 
weapons count even though the gun used in the killing has not been 
found

purse contained 1 and other personal effects when found by police 
the day after the killing 
miss wrappes mother sue wrape said her daughter a 1987 
graduate of notre dame had moved to new york to pursue her 
dream of becoming a successful artist 
she was confronted by a robber as she was returning to her 
brooklyn dormitory from her waitress job about 1 am wednesday 
when she resisted she was killed by a single bullet to the chest 
it makes me feel better that hes off the street mrs 
wrape whose family spells the surname the traditional way said in 
a telephone interview from little rock 
im sure the police and the judicial system will take care of 
it from here and we can count on justice being done 
prestia said dechirico made no statements after his arrest 
a disheveled dechirico who was unable or unwilling to stand on 
his own as he was taken from the precinct house by police simply 
said no when reporters asked him if he were guilty 
his arrest came hours after hundreds mourned miss wrappe at a 
requiem mass in her hometown and bishop andrew j mcdonald 
remembered her as a gifted artist who marched to a different 
drummer and was not afraid to be different 
she is survived by her parents four brothers and a sister

a tape recording of a preliminary strategy 
session for president reagans 1984 reelection campaign indicates 
his advisers found that his administration lacked a platform to run 
on according to a new book 
reporters jane mayer of the wall street journal and doyle 
mcmanus of the los angeles times describe the session in 
landslide a book about reagans second term published by 
houghton mifflin co 
the authors do not say how they gained access to the tape 
recording that they say was made of the fourhour confidential 
meeting held in late june 1984 in a conference room at campaign 
headquarters of reagan and vice president george bush 
they quote stuart spencer the campaigns chief strategist as 
saying on the tapes the problem is weve been talking to 
everybody at the white house over the past few days and the 
reagan administration fired all its bullets very early and very 
successfully in the first two years all their plans all their 
priorities all their programs theyve run out of ammunition 
the most striking thing i discovered is that they dont have a 
goddamn thing in the pipeline spencer is quoted as saying 
theyve run out of ammunition 
spencer a longtime reagan associate is now an adviser to 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle 
pollster robert teeter according to the book agreed with 
spencer saying days digging around and we found nothing this 
is a national election weve got to find something to say 
at one point in the discussion spencer laughed and said if he 
got a bullet in the toe it would help the election wouldnt it 
he clearly was nervous about his suggestion however and quickly 
added turn that tape off i get that cartridge when youre 
through 
mention of spencers suggestion was in the book but the authors 
elaborated on it in an article about the tapes in sunday editions 
of the washington post 
as the group searched for a theme the book says the issue of 
social security was quickly ruled out with speechwriter ken 
khachigian saying we should have the next person who even 
mentions the word fired 
the authors say that spencer suggested reagan might talk about 
acid rain and all that stuff but khachigian warned were 
better off without it if you get the old man going on it he does 
killer trees 
the killer trees phrase originated after reagan expressed 
the view in his 1980 campaign that trees cause pollution

about 500 people chanted a memorial prayer 
for the dead sunday as six holocaust survivors lit candles during 
dedication ceremonies for a monument called the tower of 
remembrance 
the 80foot granite tower topped by a 10foothigh eternal 
flame covered with gold leaf was erected at sholom memorial 
park in this chicago suburb to honor the 6 million jews killed in 
world war ii 
it means a great deal for me because i went through the 
holocaust myself said survivor pola mishell of skokie who lit 
her candle in memory of the jews from her native lithuania who died 
in the war 
mrs mishell a hebrew teacher now in her early 60s said she 
has been active in recording and speaking about her recollections 
as a teenager during the holocaust 
after the nazis emptied the jewish ghetto in her small 
lithuanian town she spent 194445 in the stutthof concentration 
camp near the presentday polish city of gdansk 
i feel this monument is very important because after we are 
all gone something will remain to remind people that such horrible 
things all happened she said 
the dedication ceremony took place during the jewish high holy 
days on the sunday between rosh hashanah the jewish new year 
and yom kippur the day of atonement when the cemetery holds its 
annual kever avot or resting place of our fathers memorial 
service at which families remember loved ones buried there said

the pump room which has served meals to 
celebrities from bogart and bacall to belushi and banned rocker 
phil collins for inappropriate dress is turning 50 and the owner 
says he wants the tradition to continue 
i want the stories of today to be as legendary as the ones of 
40 years ago said richard melman who bought the historic 
restaurant in the omni ambassador east hotel a dozen years ago 
the famous eatery where humphrey bogart and lauren bacall 
celebrated their wedding will officially mark its 50th anniversary 
oct 1 
the restaurant made its name as a place for show business and 
high society people to see and be seen but it also is a place 
where many go to celebrate anniversaries or graduations 
to this day many people come here for special occasions 
they get very emotional about it melman said so do i i dont 
feel like the owner as much as the curator of part of chicagos 
history 
the pump room was founded by ernie byfield in 1938 and soon 
became known as the place where stars had to go when they stopped 
in the windy city on their train trips to hollywood 
celebrities such as sammy davis jr clark gable bette davis 
judy garland frank sinatra marlene dietrich the duke and duchess 
of windsor rock group led zeppelin and canine beer promoter spuds 
mackenzie have put their names or paw prints in the great 
signature book of the pump room 
a historical booklet put out as part of the anniversary 
celebration lists almost 1000 celebrities who have visited the 
pump room 
customers wearing sneakers and men without jackets are politely 
turned away from the restaurant sometimes 
the rule apparently depends on how famous people are one of the 
most prominently displayed photographs in the restaurant shows 
actor john belushi clad in a tshirt having dinner with film 
critic roger ebert 
but rock star phil collins was turned away because of 
inappropriate dress by a maitre d who did not recognize him and 
that led to the title of the singers hit album no jacket

a couple who returned from a hurricanemarred 
vacation sunday said hundreds of frantic tourists were still 
stranded on the battered resort isle of cozumel mexico when they 
left 
the airport was a madhouse said fletcher walls of johnson 
city tenn im very concerned about the conditions on cozumel 
and about the people down there 
he said the islands drinking water was exhausted and food and 
medical supplies were running low 
cozumel is in bad shape he said there is no electricity 
on the island and no communications with the mainland we felt cut 
off from the rest of the world after wednesday the day the storm 
hit the island 
walls said he and his wife sandra were lucky to have been able 
to get aboard an unscheduled charter flight that left cozumel late 
saturday night they arrived in atlanta a few hours later after a 
refueling stop at new orleans 
as of saturday only continental airlines was flying into 
cozumel he said there were fistfights at the airport the day 
before the people there are scared they need help 
he said the eye of hurricane gilbert passed just six miles north 
of cozumel a small island located 11 miles off of mexicos 
caribbean coast 30 miles south of cancun 
people were evacuated from cancun but i dont know of anyone 
who was able to get off of cozumel before the storm hit he said 
there wasnt any way to leave the island once the wind picked up 
and the seas got rough 
authorities on cozumel didnt seemed overly worried about the 
storm until tuesday walls said 
everyone seemed to think it would turn northward and miss 
us he said but the hotel management called a meeting tuesday 
night and told the guests that gilbert had hit jamiaca and 
apparently would reach cozumel the next day unless it changed 
course by then the wind had already started to pick up 
we were given some emergency supplies candles drinking 
water and food and were told to lock ourselves in the bathroom 
and prop our mattress up against the bathroom door if the storm 
came our way 
he said he and his wife had a secondfloor room and were able to 
ride out the storm in that fashion 
the air pressure got intense but the sound of the wind was 
the worst part walls said the noise was terrific a gust of 
wind blew out our big picture window shortly after the hurricane 
hit later the skylight popped out and a light fixture came loose 
and began banging and clanging it sounded like the roof was coming 
off 
the storm hit us wednesday morning about 630 am and lasted 
until 2 pm it was interesting but i wouldnt want to do it again 
we were told some of those wind gusts exceeded 200 miles per hour

orthodox jews on sunday mourned the loss of six 
sacred scrolls that police said were set afire in a synagogue by 
two neighborhood boys 
about 5000 people including mayor edward i koch turned out 
for the service near congregation sharai torah in the heavily 
jewish flatbush section of the borough of brooklyn 
two boys ages 12 and 15 were arrested and accused of setting 
fire to the torah scrolls and spraypainting 15 swastikas on the 
walls of the synagogue the fire damaged the interior of the 
building and its contents 
the incident occurred early saturday the sabbath between rosh 
hashana and yom kippur the two holiest days on the jewish calender 
you couldnt do a worse crime to the jewish people said 
city councilman noach dear who described the mood of the community 
as one of anger hurt and puzzlement 
the two boys were charged sunday as juvenile delinquents with 
arson burglary and criminal mischief said sgt raymond odonnell 
a police spokesman they were released to the custody of their 
parents 
neither boy is jewish according to another police spokesman 
officer hugh barry barry said both youths lived near the synagogue 
dear said the replacement cost of the scrolls could be as high 
as 50000 each torahs containing the first five books of the old 
testament are considered the holiest objects in judaism it takes 
one person about one year to produce one inscribing it by hand 
under exacting religious guidelines 
rabbi hillel david held a funeral service sunday for the torahs 
in accordance with jewish law with burial in a cemetery 
hes in mourning rep charles schumer dny said of 
david who founded the congregation in 1965 its as if he lost a 
child 
the congregation is temporarily using a jewish high school for 
prayer 
koch said sunday he was relieved that the suspects were 
juveniles and not members of some organized adult organization 
the fact that theyre juveniles puts a somewhat different cast 
on the vicious action of arson and bias that took place koch 
said they have to be punished they also have to be carefully 
taught to respect and tolerate and even to love 
others however found it chilling that the suspects were so 
young this scares everybody dear said 
the incident came against a backdrop of a rising number of 
antisemitic incidents nationwide according to the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith 
i have never heard of any desecration in the united states in 
recent years where that number of torahs was destroyed said 
justin finger the leagues associate national director

rasputin which premiered over the weekend 
at the new york city opera is a serious and sometimes shockingly 
sensual production with a strong sense of unity and easily grasped 
plot and music 
the production about the powerworshiping mad monk who 
advised the family of russias last czar is jay reises first 
opera the 38yearold reise who teaches music at the university 
of pennsylvania also wrote the libretto 
although rasputin was sung in english the libretto was 
shown on a screen above the new york state theater stage so the 
audience saturday night wouldnt have to strain to understand an 
unfamiliar opera some of the music is tonal some atonal 
the opera begins with rasputin preaching carnal sin as a path to 
salvation while a woman in a body stocking writhes on the floor in 
front of him this is more effective than the usual operatic orgy 
in which people wave their arms around sexlessly like undersea 
plants moved by waves 
bassbaritone john cheek who sings with this company and with 
the metropolitan opera sang rasputin he is tall young and 
wellbuilt for the barechested scenes but wasnt quite forceful 
enough in his singing or acting 
rasputin is such an outrageous character that cheek could 
project still more fire but he is definitely on the right track 
margaret cusack was czarina alexandra who takes rasputins 
advice in matters of state because he once stopped her hemophiliac 
sons bleeding ms cusack sung high notes that would cause some 
sopranos to screech 
price was splendid in the third principal role prince felix 
yusupov jon garrison acted and sang with conviction as a terrified 
czar nicholas relying on a strong wife john lankston also was 
splendid as a doctor helpless before hemophilia 
the staging by frank corsaro is direct and powerful a 
nightclub scene in which prince yusupov sings that hes bebe 
damour is meant to indicate a decadent society just before it 
falls price wearing tailcoat shorts nylons garter belt and 
high heels looks much like joel grey in cabaret 
there is wonderful use of stylized staging erick avari in a 
nonsinging role as lenin gives a speech behind a brightly lighted 
transparent screen his profile and listeners facing him from 
across the stage are silhouetted 
in another scene couples dance in silhouette at stage rear 
establishing a ballroom setting and allowing major characters 
uncluttered use of the stage front 
this uncluttered staging looks more german expressionistic than 
russian but it suits the opera 
christopher keene who will succeed beverly sills as general 
director of the company in march conducted an obviously 
wellprepared orchestra 
the twoact opera isnt unusually long but some of act 2 might 
have been trimmed some plot points made crystal clear the first 
time are retold

a small wagon train slowly moved 
westward sunday along the route of the cherokee indians trail of 
tears bolstered by the arrival of two additional wagons and a 
bright blue sky 
a lot of us have stiff muscles and are a little bit saddle 
sore but well get over that said ray morris of golconda ill 
the coordinator of the wagon train project 
the wagon train is commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 
forced removal of the cherokees from their eastern homelands to 
oklahoma about 4000 of the 13000 indians who made the 1000mile 
march died along the way 
the six covered wagons set out saturday from nearby red clay 
state historical park the last eastern council ground of the 
cherokees bound for tahlequah okla 
no indians have joined the group but morris said he expects 
several to ride along as the trip progresses 
two wagons joined the train saturday night when the group camped 
at a farm just west of cleveland 17 miles from the park 
well have dozens of wagons joining us off and on before we 
reach oklahoma in early december morris predicted sunday he 
said the wagon train will average 16 miles a day as it follows the 
winding route that the cherokees took in 1838 when they walked 
through tennessee kentucky illinois missouri arkansas and 
oklahoma 
two of the more experienced hands on the wagon train are norman 
muleman fowler of camden tenn and his australian sheep dog 
clipper 
me and clipper are big buddies weve been on wagon trains 
before said fowler a mule skinner and logger a pair of matched 
mules pulled his wooden wagon which is carrying the tennessee flag 
to oklahoma 
fowler said he hoped to make the entire trip to oklahoma but 
might have to stop when the wagon train reaches the kentucky border 
two weeks from now fowler said he was expecting financial help 
from the state department of tourism but that apparently isnt 
going to happen 
ricky todd the tennessee state coordinator for the project 
said he is hoping some sponsors will come forward as the wagon 
train moves westward 
this is a private nonprofit project said todd who raises 
and sells horses our goal is to do some consciousnessraising 
about the terrible thing our government did to the cherokees 
anybody who wants to help us or join us as we travel along the 
trail is welcome to do so

israel was planning to launch an experimental 
satellite soon as part of a program to orbit a spy satellite a 
newspaper reported sunday 
the daily hadashot quoting foreign sources said the 
experimental part of the program would last two years and that the 
spy satellite is to be carried by israels improved jerichoii 
missile 
prime minister yitzhak shamir refused to confirm or deny the 
report 
i dont deal with subjects of this type shamir said in an 
interview with staterun israel radio you have to turn to the 
people and industries that deal with this 
foreign minister shimon peres told the radio i cant know 
about every subject defense ministry spokesman dan weinreich and 
a foreign ministry spokesman declined comment 
in washington the pentagon and the state department said they 
had no information on the report 
the newspaper did not further identify its foreign sources used 
as a basis for the story such attribution is sometimes used by 
israeli newspapers to get around restrictions of the israeli 
military censor 
unnamed defense experts were quoted by hadashot as saying 
putting up a spy satellite could increase israels deterrence 
providing accurate and immediate information and the investment 
would pay for itself by reducing reconnaissance flights 
the genevabased international defense review reported in july 
that israel had successfully fired its jericho missile into the 
mediterranean sea its maximum range was to reach 920 miles the 
magazine wrote 
two major dailies yediot ahronot and maariv devoted frontpage 
articles sunday to israels reported plan to launch a spy satellite 
a decision by israels 25member cabinet which holds its 
regular meetings sunday was due on the launching date yediot 
quoted the british magazine flight international as saying 
yuval neeman head of israels space agency told the associated 
press that israel was in the final stages of developing satellites 
for use in communications and science he said the first israeli 
satellite would probably be launched in 1992 by the european space 
consortium ariane 
asked to comment on the reports about a reconnaissance 
satellite neeman said our present work is related to scientific 
experiments and communications it doesnt mean that sometime in 
the future israel wont move in such direction reconnaissance 
last month israel announced plans to launch two communication 
satellites amos1 and amos2 in early 1990s the satellites are 
to be launched by the french ariane rocket 
the satellite was the lead item on israel radio throughout the 
day

a refusal by new york mayor edward i 
koch to meet with irishamerican leaders led a suburban official to 
call sunday for a sort of boycott of the outspoken mayor 
nassau county comptroller peter king said at a festival that 
irishamerican groups should keep koch who is expected to seek 
reelection next year out of their organizations and activities 
and resulting photographs 
king was angered by kochs refusal friday to meet with 
irishamerican leaders because a member of the irish northern aid 
committee martin galvin was in the group the committee supports 
the attempt to drive british troops out of northern ireland and 
unite the protestantdominated province with the mostly catholic 
southern republic 
also in the group friday was the national president of the 
ancient order of hibernians and others who had traveled to new york 
city from five states for the scheduled meeting 
michael cummings spokesman for the national office of the 
ancient order disagreed with kings boycott proposal saying 
irishamericans should take advantage of contact with koch to 
educate him about the irish conflict 
but he added if i were mr koch i dont think i would be 
attending too many irishamerican functions 
koch has offended people on more than one side of the irish 
conflict which has resulted in more than 2000 deaths the past two 
decades when he returned from a trip to ireland in july he 
suggested the british were a peacekeeping force rather than an 
occupying army in northern ireland then backed off and apologized 
angering those who liked his first statement 
it is time to ban him completely from every irishamerican 
activity including the st patricks day parade king said 
koch who wears a sweater he bought in ireland during the parade 
and calls himself okoch welcomed the action 
i am happy to be boycotted by peter king mr galvin and other 
supporters of terrorism koch said 
so what i dont care i consider it a compliment 
koch said that the group had not given him a guest list until 
thursday and when he discovered that galvin was on it the mayor 
told them he would meet with anyone except the representatives of 
terrorism the group he said declined to reschedule the meeting 
without galvin 
pat murphy a spokeswoman for king said that jack irwin state 
president of the ancient order of hibernians supported kings call 
for a boycott

rights and liberties

courtyard of romains luxurious house in the suburb of delmas and 
the property was occupied by soldiers 
the house was stripped doors were torn off the hinges it was 
a shell the witness said

barracks was named commanderinchief of the army but avril did 
not mention paul dessalines is the most feared unit in the 
7000man army 
paul who has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges 
in miami had been considered the most powerful figure in haiti 
after namphy it was not known if paul played a role in the coup 
but sources said namphy and paul were at odds 
in washington state department spokeswoman anita stockman said 
noncommissioned officers of the presidential guard captured namphy 
in an apparently bloodless coup and persuaded avril to take over

human rights violations and the general deterioration in the 
security situation punctuated by attacks against the churches over 
the past two weeks

forced to act again he said 
avril a bespectacled slim man of medium height was dressed in 
a military uniform he was introduced as the most honest officer 
in the armed forces by a sergeant who wore full battle gear

denny bungarz knew he 
wanted to be a forest ranger from age 11 when his family camped in 
northern california in the 1940s to escape a polio scare 
he achieved that goal and 42 years later he ended up being the 
fire boss who protected the historic old faithful lodge from the 
firestorm that has engulfed yellowstone national park the 
countrys oldest national park 
letting that burn would have been an end to everybodys 
career starting with mine said bungarz who works in the 
mendocino national forest in northern california australia 
wouldnt have been far enough away for us 
bungarz 53 became a local celebrity as he appeared regularly 
on national news broadcasts during the wild days of early 
september when the north fork fire attacked the old faithful area 
with 400foot flames 
that came only several days after the fire roared toward the 
montana community of west yellowstone on the outskirts of the park 
protecting those areas with the loss of some cabins at old 
faithful was one of the few successes of firefighters battling the 
335500acre blaze 
bungarz was the incident commander on the north fork fire during 
those hectic days but he doesnt consider himself the hero many 
people think he is 
we threw everything at that fire from day one we tried 
everything we knew of or could think of he said but he readily 
conceded that in many ways the fire prevailed 
it seemed everything we did didnt work bungarz said 
like one line in camp went what does the north fork fire do 
when the wind comes up whatever it wants to 
bungarz said he thinks humor is essential in the tense and often 
scary business of fighting fires 
it helps smooth things out when you start to have fun with 
each other he said 
bungarz directed firefighters on the north fork fire from a camp 
at madison junction 14 miles east of west yellowstone he left 
over the weekend when his team was relieved 
bungarz like other firefighting officials knows the political 
firestorm over handling of the fires is just beginning he wouldnt 
be surprised to be called to testify before congress which plans 
hearings on the fires that have affected 12 million acres of the 
parks 22 million acres 
well just tell them what happened and what we did bungarz 
said our work and our meetings have been open to the public 
all the way and theyll stay that way if we made mistakes well 
take our lumps

the social democrats kept control of 
parliament and the upstart greens environmental party won seats for 
the first time nationwide election returns showed sunday 
the governing party architects of swedens welfare state faced 
one of its most serious election challenges in 50 years in the 
first national vote since its leader olaf palme was assassinated 
on feb 28 1986 
the big losers appeared to be the three nonsocialist parties 
a computer projection carried by swedish television based on 
returns from 340 of 360 population centers indicated that the 
moderates liberals and center party would lose 21 of their 171 
seats in the 349seat riksdag or parliament 
the social democrats lost only one of their 159 seats and the 
greens picked up 20 seats the television projections showed the 
computer projection indicated the communists which had 19 seats 
picked up two additional seats 
overall the social democrats were projected to win 439 percent 
of the total or 158 seats the moderates 179 percent 64 seats 
the liberals 12 percent or 43 seats the center party 119 
percent or 43 seats the communists 57 percent or 21 seats the 
greens 55 percent 20 seats and the christian democrats 31 
percent no seats 
prime minister ingvar carlsson leader of the social democrats 
said the government will hold the same course and offered a 
critique of the greens 
we will stick to the same policy as before he said in a 
television interview the interesting thing is that the 
environment party entered parliament but are not power brokers 
that is good maybe even for them 
the problem is that we dont know where they stand carlsson 
said of the greens we will be able to judge them by their deeds 
in the riksdag 
greens spokeswoman eva goes declined to say whether her party 
will lean to the left or right 
well be dynamic when it comes to ecology thats what this 
election is about the issues of the future the 1990s and you 
can ask yourself whether that is left or right she said in a 
television interview 
greens members were jubilant over their victory 
great fun said party spokesman birger schlaug this was 
an impossible project to get a new party into swedens riksdag 
our existence means parliament will be greener and thats whats 
needed 
political analyst soren holmberg called the showing by the three 
nonsocialists a disaster and their worst result in swedish 
history 
the voter turnout was an unusually low 858 percent of those 
eligible television reported 
also competing for the attention of 63 million registered 
voters were about 100 minor parties they ranged from the socialist 
workers party which opposes foreign immigration to sweden to the 
donald duck party a joke party with no platform for voters who 
might otherwise turn in blank ballots 
swedes also choose 284 municipal and 24 county councils and vote 
on local issues 
a series of scandals have eroded support for the social 
democrats in the past two years among them was failure of police 
to find palmes killer and reports of official bungling in the 
investigation 
at the same time opposition to nuclear power and growing 
environmental concerns especially among young people drew support 
to the greens and away from the established parties 
preelection polling suggested the communists were in danger of 
being shut out for the first time since their founding in 1917 
on the eve of the election carlsson got mediocre reviews on 
his performance in a televised debate friday night 
with the exception of 19761982 when the country was governed 
by a center right coalition the social democrats have been at the 
helm of the swedish welfare state since 1932 
in the election campaign they stressed their economic 
successes such as reducing unemployment from 3 percent to 17 
percent one of the worlds lowest rates they also stressed 
standardized health care child care and universal education in 
sweden where poverty is practically unknown 
the countrys taxes are however the highest in the world an 
employee making the equivalent of 50000 a year can expect to give 
half of it to the government and the rate can reach up to 80 
percent for higher incomes 
consumer prices are boosted by a 234 percent value added tax 
rate and inflation about 7 percent so far this year is roughly 
twice the european average 
the three nonsocialist parties proposed various options for tax 
reforms they also urged a loosening of welfare regulations that 
would allow swedes to choose private health care and schools for 
their children

portauprince haiti ap the motives behind sundays 
military coup in haiti were obscure but the first reaction from 
advocates of democratic reform was optimism 
i will support the military government if they say as soon as 
possible when they will call elections we are ready to speak with 
any government that respects human rights said louis dejoie ii 
60yearold leader of the national agricultural industrial party 
said by telephone from puerto rico 
brig gen prosper avril who seized power in a palace coup from 
lt gen henri namphy promised in his first public statement to 
respect civil liberties human rights and said dialogue will be 
honored for the sake of national reconciliation 
the statement was considered signficant because it echoed a 
recent offer for dialogue from opposition leader marc bazin a 
conservative leader of the committee for democratic understanding 
bazin and dejoie were among the four leading candidates for 
president in the nov 29 elections that were aborted by the 
independent electoral council when armed thugs supported by the 
army attacked voters at the polls the council was later abolished 
by namphy who held new elections jan 17 
the leading candidates boycotted the second election which was 
won by leslie manigat who was in office only four months when 
namphy ousted him in a bloodless coup 
in the next week or so i expect them the military to say 
when elections will be held they must do it or they wont have any 
support dejoie said 
even haitis small communist party expressed pleasure with the 
turn of events 
this has come at the right moment to put an end to a 
government which was going to lead the country to an abyss we 
greet with satisfaction the first declaration of the new 
president said max bourjolly second in command of the party 
another opposition politician hubert de ronceray runnerup to 
manigat in the militarycontrolled elections of jan 17 said 
all our difficulties come from the absence of dialogue dialogue 
is indispensable to the democratic process bazin has only revived 
the theme 
a western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
predicted the new military government will maintain the old 
cabinet but propose an opening to civilians with a view to 
elections 
he also said other motives played a role in the coup 
the coup seems to have begun as the coup against manigat did 
with the noncommissioned officers and soldiers of the 1000man 
presidential guard he said under manigat they felt slighted 
and felt their privileges threatened under namphy they did not 
receive the material signs of recognition they expected and on top 
of that the atrocity last sunday must have affected these men of 
the people while the high command stood by 
on sept 11 about 20 men armed with machetes handguns and 
steel pikes attacked a church during a mass being said by the rev 
bertrand aristide a militant opponent of the military government 
thirteen people were killed and 77 wounded namphys government was 
blamed by opponents for the violence 
the presidential guardsmen were the first military men to 
publicly condemn the government 
the diplomat speculated that the fact that col jeanclaude paul 
did not intervene with his 700man dessalines battalion indicated 
he was in favor of ousting namphy 
avrils margin of maneuver will be limited by the ncos who 
have gotten a taste for power having now overthrown two 
governments one civilian one military he said 
there was at least one opponent of namphy who was still not 
satisfied with developments 
sylvio claude leader of the christian democratic party and one 
of haitis most popular politicians said in an interview on radio 
soleil sunday the coup was imminent but the person who replaced 
namphy is unacceptable he was already rejected by the people he 
is known as a duvalierist and all duvalierists are criminals

roman catholic priests in the baltimore 
archdiocese were urged to support the states handgun control law 
during their sunday homilies to parishioners 
the request was made by the archdioceses justice and peace 
commission in a strongly worded letter signed by its director 
christine aw doby 
a referendum on rescinding the law which bans cheap easily 
concealable handguns will be on the nov 8 ballot opponents 
collected enough signatures to bring it before the voters 
the letter sent to the 700 priests in the archdiocese refers 
to the opponents of the law as apostles of violence running a 
campaign of propaganda based on deception in their effort to 
defeat the ban 
there was no immediate indication whether priests had complied 
with the request the archdiocese includes all the state except 
southern maryland the washington suburbs and the eastern shore 
the handgun control law was passed by the 1988 maryland general 
assembly and signed by gov william donald schaefer the law 
establishes an appointed board to compile a roster of handguns that 
may be made or sold in the state after jan 1 1990 
fred griiser chairman of the maryland committee against the gun 
ban criticized the commissions tactic saying that by issuing the 
letter to priests the church was putting words in the priests 
mouths 
does this now mean all catholics are against us griiser 
asked i dont think what the church is for is to take a stand 
on government issues im sorry to see theyre getting involved in 
it if the churchs job is spiritual guidance thats what they 
should stick to 
ms doby said urging priests to speak on a local public issue 
was very unusual she said the mailing was not the 
archdiocese of baltimore telling priests this is what youre 
supposed to say these are not marching orders this is not a 
script 
the bishops of the maryland catholic conference are already on 
record as supporting the law 
supporters contend the law will curb the proliferation of cheap 
handguns called saturday night specials while opponents say they 
fear it could eventually prohibit the sale of all new handguns

the christianled army said sunday it 
rejected what it called an attempt by the united states and syria 
to name a new lebanese president 
christians and moslems in the lebanese parliament which is 
empowered to name a successor to president amin gemayel before his 
term ends friday have been deadlocked for five weeks over who will 
be the new head of state 
the military command said in a statement that army commander 
gen michel aoun was informed by an american official that us 
envoy richard murphy and syrian leaders agreed to name the 
lebanese president 
the statement thanked them for their efforts to find ways of 
ending the stalemate that threatens to reignite lebanons 
13yearold civil war between moslems and christians 
but it indirectly accused the americans and syrians of meddling 
in lebanese affairs 
the army cannot accept the principle of appointing a lebanese 
president because the choice of the president should be made 
exclusively by the lebanese parliament the statement said 
constitutionally gemayel cannot run for a second consecutive 
sixyear term 
the army issued the statement soon after murphy assistant 
secretary of state for near eastern affairs said he was confident 
parliament will resolve its deadlock 
i certainly hope so because i think that the choice of no 
election would be a very unfortunate choice indeed he told 
reporters after meeting with gemayel and other leaders 
he flew from beirut to larnaca cyprus in a lebanese military 
helicopter after the talks airport sources in larnaca said he 
caught a scheduled flight to paris en route to washington 
a lebanese army source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
one of murphys aides david newton met aoun at his residence in 
nakkash north of beirut and told him of the alleged deal worked 
out by murphy and syrian officials in damascus during the last five 
days 
christian sources also speaking anonymously said auon was told 
the americans and syrians agreed to support the election of 
christian parliament member mikhail daher as president daher 58 
represents akkar province in north lebanon an area controlled by 
the syrian army which has some 40000 troops in lebanon 
the lebanese broadcasting corp television station run by the 
lebanese forces the christians main militia said gemayel and the 
maronite patriarch mar nasrallah butros told murphy they opposed 
dahers selection 
it said the militia sympathetic to israel and bitterly opposed 
to syrian intervention also rejected dahers appointment as 
president 
the army statement did not explicitly say it would take military 
action to prevent the appointment of any president not elected by 
parliament 
an attempt to hold parliamentary voting to choose a new 
president collapsed aug 18 after proisraeli christians opposed 
the candidacy of syrianbacked former president suleiman franjieh 
and boycotted the session a 51member quorum is required to elect 
a president 
sources close to parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite 
moslem said he will advance the date set for a parliamentary 
session to elect a new president from thursday to tuesday 
murphy arrived in beirut from damascus earlier sunday after four 
days of intensive talks with syrian leaders on how to break the 
electoral deadlock in lebanon 
asked whether agreement has been reached on a consensus 
candidate murphy said i dont want to go into details the 
current situation is very sensitive and delicate

pope john paul ii his shoulders 
draped with a leopard skin on sunday urged the marxist government 
and rebels to end their 12year civil war and called for 
international aid to rebuild the country 
i felt the heart of the people bleed the pope told roman 
catholic bishops criticized by the government for advocating 
negotiations with the mozambique national resistance rebels 
during the last full day of a 10day trip through southern 
africa the pope comforted victims whose limbs were blown off by 
land mines celebrated mass at a soccer stadium decked with 
political banners and was greeted by a boisterous crowd of 5000 
when he blessed an orphanage in a slum of reed huts 
he met with antiapartheid clergy leaders from neighboring south 
africa which mozambiques government has accused of aiding the 
guerrilla insurgency the civil war began shortly after mozambique 
gained independence from portugal in 1975 
with violence nothing can be built and much is lost he 
said urging citizens of this nation on the indian ocean coast of 
southeastern africa to follow the path of dialogue and 
reconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood among 
brothers 
addressing himself to the rebels the pope said abandon the 
paths of violence and vengeance put aside destructive action and 
try to save whats left 
the government he said should make efforts in the sense of 
building 
this nation needs assistance from other peoples and from the 
international community he said let me stress the urgency of 
this solidarity aimed at a quick total pacification and immediate 
aid grants to save a large amount of human lives 
the government accuses the guerrillas of massacres and 
destruction of crops the rebels deny such charges 
among the crowd of about 50000 were the antiapartheid church 
leaders from south africa including the rev allan boesak 
president of the world alliance of reformed churches and the rev 
frank chikane general secretary of the south african council of 
churches they are leaders of a civil disobedience campaign 
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid south africas 
system of racial segregation 
boesak and chikane at a news conference following the meeting 
with the pope criticized john paul for meeting with south african 
authorities 
boesak suggested that the pope should have made more explicit 
criticisms of apartheid during his 10day tour of southern africa 
which included an unscheduled stop in south africa because of bad 
weather in lesotho 
boesak said the threehour papal stop in johannesburg was a 
propaganda coup for south african authorities who had complained 
previously about the omission of their country from the official 
itinerary 
chikane said at the news conference that the pope had met with 
officials who were persecuting us and had been escorted by 
people who torture us 
banners at machava sports stadium bore slogans such as 
apartheid is the nazism of our era and one does not negotiate 
the motherland one defends it 
during his homily the pope said mozambique should be afforded 
peace from the outside of an ideological military and economic 
nature an apparent reference to south africa which has been 
accused of using a variety of tactics to harrass mozambique 
the pope wore a leopard skin a symbol of power to many 
africans most of the crowd at the stadium joined a 300strong 
choir in singing the hymn what a friend we have in jesus in the 
tsonga language to the accompaniment of drums and handclapping 
gifts of ivory carvings fruit and a brass chalice were carried 
up a redcarpeted stairway to the altar children released balloons 
and white doves one of which alighted briefly on the head of a 
whiterobed priest 
the pontiff who returns to rome on monday has visited 
zimbabwe botswana swaziland and lesotho and made a brief 
unscheduled stop in south africa when his plane was diverted in bad 
weather 
the war in mozambique has forced 2 million of the 145 million 
population to flee their homes and left millions more in need for 
foreign food aid 
mozambique has been campaigning for more international relief 
aid food and other supplies do not always reach the rural areas 
where they are needed because of attacks by guerrillas and 
transportation difficulties 
john paul offered 50000 to patients at maputo central 
hospital where he visited six wards before the mass he blessed 
and gave vatican medals to amputees and other victims of guerrilla 
attacks and he kissed children lying in their beds 
i suffer because you are suffering and it is not in my power 
to cure you the pope said 
in july the vatican tried to encourage peace efforts in 
mozambique by sending one of john pauls top aides to meet 
separately with mozambiques president joaquim chissano and south 
african president pw botha 
chissano met the pope last may in rome but the vactican appears 
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an 
incentive to advancing the peace process 
about oneeighth of mozambiques people are catholic the 
government does nothing to promote or encourage religion but 
tolerates the roman catholic church and other religious groups and 
has been working to improve strained relations 
the government recently returned places of worship that it said 
were mistakenly confiscated during a period of nationalization 
following independence but hospitals and schools formerly run by 
churches remain nationalized

workers searched on sunday for the 
bodies of up to 200 people swept away when a river poured over its 
banks and overturned four buses ninety people were confirmed dead 
a us coast guard helicopter lost power and crashed during 
evacuation operations in sabinas de hidalgo but no one was 
injured officials said 
the buses were caught in the path of the santa catarina river 
when a flash flood spawned by hurricane gilbert ripped a 
40milelong path of destruction saturday through northern mexicos 
most populated region 
it was the epilogue to a week of death and havoc caused by 
gilbert which ravaged the yucatan peninsula resort areas of 
cancun cozumel and isla mujeres before crossing the gulf of mexico 
and hitting mexico again in the northeast near texas 
the storm killed at least 98 people while coursing the 
caribbean including 29 in the yucatan when it hit land last 
wednesday with winds of up to 200 mph 26 in jamaica 30 in haiti 
five in the dominican republic and eight in honduras two people 
were klled saturday in texas by tornados spawned by the storm 
but it was in this capital of the state of nuevo leon where 
gilbert exacted its highest death toll after it weakened into a 
tropical storm late friday 
gilberts rains created a 10footdeep 150yardwide torrent of 
muddy water by saturday when the river roared through monterrey by 
sunday it was almost back to its normal size of 20 feet allowing 
soldiers to use cranes to pull the crushed body of one intercity 
passenger bus from the mud 
they hope to find bodies because they dont know exactly how 
many people were in the bus or how many were able to save 
themselves said rescue coordinator lt col vicente gamez of the 
7th military zone 
the first bus yanked by its chassis from a murky grave in the 
monterrey riverbed revealed only empty seats twisted metal and 
piles of shoes and clothing 
soldiers used picks to dig through the rubble of mud stones and 
tree branches inside the buss crushed remains 
another bus also upside down and crushed lay in the gravel on 
the other side of the stream the remains of two other buses were 
further downstream 
gamez said only two survivors were located by sunday 
eduardo pichardo an employee of the transportes de la frontera 
bus line said he believed about 64 people were aboard the two 
buses from his company that were destroyed in the flood 
it was not known how many other passengers were aboard the other 
two buses one identified as belonging to the transportes noreste 
line and another possibly an urban bus 
but state officials said the total aboard the four buses was 
about 200 and that 90 people were confirmed dead a considerable 
number of people were missing said jose natividad gonzalez 
baras nuevo leon state secretary 
the storm left 30000 people homeless and caused about 60 
million in damages to public roads bridges and other facilities in 
the metropolitan monterrey gonzalez baras said 
president miguel de la madrid toured damaged areas in monterrey 
sunday i want to extend my most sincere condolences to the 
families of those that lost their lives he said 
four state judicial policemen and two civilian volunteers also 
drowned when they attempted to rescue victims state authorities 
said 
a us coast guard helicopter evacuating residents from the 
small town of colorado abajo to nearby sabinas hidalgo lost power 
about 345 pm as it took off and fell about 50 feet brushing a 
house under construction the sabinas hidalgo municipal police 
reported 
commander leopoldo villarreal said the three americans and one 
mexican on board were taken to the local hospital for a checkup and 
released their names were not immediately available 
about 12 inches of rain fell over the 24hour period before the 
flood but the destruction was caused by runoff from the towering 
peaks of the sierra madre oriental chain that surrounds this 
semiarid metropolitan area 
meanwhile in northeastern mexico us coast guard aircraft 
from new orleans were picking up scores of people near vallecillo 
that were threatened by swollen rivers as scattered rains continued 
in northeastern mexico and parts of texas mexican state 
authorities requested the coast guard assistance 
gamez said other rescue crews were searching for bodies in 
cadereyta about 20 miles downstream from monterrey where the flood 
also wiped out homes and killed more than a dozen people 
an estimated 20000 people packed shelters throughout the area 
sunday most left homeless when the flood swept away homes built 
along the rivers edge 
the homes were evacuated hours before the destruction hit but 
most of the poor residents who occupied them lost their lifes 
possessions 
many used picks or bare hands to dig through the rubble that 
remained where their tiny concrete and tin houses had stood 
they hoped to rescue scant possessions a tiny mudcovered 
television set a twisted metal kitchen cabinet a pair of shoes 
that no longer could be of any use

two theaters bolstered security after two 
youths were shot and hundreds more were involved in fights during 
the weekend premiere of a rap music movie 
the first shooting occurred after the management of a downtown 
theater amc midtown announced the 930 showing friday night of 
tougher than leather featuring the rap group rundmc was 
canceled and asked those with ticket stubs to line up for refunds 
fights broke out in the lobby and the auditorium of the theater 
as groups of teenagers from different neighborhoods taunted each 
other and hurled popcorn and soda across the seats according to 
witnesses and police 
minutes later with about 200 people still inside the darkened 
auditorium shots rang out officials said 
filmgoers rushed out of the theater the injured youth wayne 
brown collapsed a halfblock away with a wound in his buttocks 
brown was released from thomas jefferson university hospital 
saturday 
in the second incident at the eric 3 on the campus theater 
near drexel university and the university of pennsylvania two 
youths began arguing during the movie at about 1040 pm 
according to usher charles hancock 
one guy yells i got a gun everybody started rushing for 
the doors hancock said 
fights broke out and before the melee ended a 19yearold man 
walking by the theater was shot in the hip orville walls was in 
good condition sunday night at the hospital of the university of 
pennsylvania 
police declined to link the shooting with the violence inside 
the theater walls said sunday the angle of the shot indicated the 
gunman was on the sidewalk and not inside the theater doors 
detective alfred bilstein said no further incidents were 
reported saturday or sunday 
the amc midtown canceled two saturday matinees but reopened 
saturday night with the movie playing on both screens a halfdozen 
police officers stood guard 
we dont feel it is the movie that caused the problems said 
midtown general manager jim francisco the movie isnt that 
violent we think the major problem was that we didnt have enough 
seats to accommodate all the potential customers 
police agreed 
now that they are showing in both theaters they have 
alleviated much of the problems bilstein said no one is 
waiting outside now 
at the other theater manager dean lindo said he would use seven 
security guards instead of two and 10 ushers instead of six 
im going to talk with our district manager and try to get 
this movie out of here lindo said were very upset because 
the theater is geared mainly toward college students 
concerts featuring rundmc in other cities in recent years have 
attracted youth gangs and resulted in violence and relatively large 
numbers of drug and theft arrests

when the metropolitan opera started presenting 
occasional sunday recitals by some of its singers in 1978 tenor 
luciano pavarotti already a superstar sang the first one 
on sunday he sang his second one with met artistic director 
james levine accompanying on piano if his voice has lost quality 
in the 10 years youd never know it from this recital 
he looks physically fit too and has not put back all the 
weight he lost in last years bout of slimming 
levine complements a singer beautifully neither keeping the 
piano too far in the background nor pushing too far forward 
pavarotti began with a love aria from mozarts cosi fan 
tutte and there was a hint of strain there though a listener had 
to strain to be sure of it from then on all was golden 
pavarotti not only has a surpassingly beautiful tone but it is 
individual if you turn on a radio and hes singing you know its 
pavarotti on sunday his voice was flexible in fast passages and 
his tones were rounded and substantial his voice filled out later 
in his career than he expected from its early smallscaled purity 
acting with his voice isnt pavarottis strongest quality but he 
shaded into an effective pianissimo several times it wasnt 
ultraquiet pianissimo but it was soft enough to express the emotion 
called for 
he bit into the mappari aria from von flotows opera 
martha with deep familiarity and the audience responded at the 
end with especially lengthy applause 
another of the special winners was pourquoi me reveiller 
from massenets werther audiences know how theyd like to hear 
that sung in the opera and pavarotti made that idea materialize in 
the darker parts of the aria he didnt make it extremely dark 
just shaded 
he didnt sing only arias but included some art songs by 
bellini respighi and one each by mascagni sibella and denza 
encores included an aria from tosca marie chiare by tosti 
and nessun dorma from turandot the melodically soaring 
aria which pavarotti likes to make his final encore

stbernarddelacolle quebec ap uniformed veterans marched 
in this town near the us border on sunday and dedicated a 
national cemetery for canadians who fought in the vietnam war 
organizers described the event as the official welcome home 
for canadians who served in the us military in vietnam 
the cemetery was named after richard paul dextraze one of 70 
canadians who died in vietnam they were remembered in two days of 
religious services and ceremonies in this farming community of 
1500 about 25 miles south of montreal near the new york border 
jacques dextraze said his family was not surprised when his 
younger brother richard paul went south to join the us marines 
but he said his father was probably the most upset when the 
21yearold died in action in 1969 
the canadian government the military wasnt doing anything 
that excited a kid his age and with the american forces being 
involved in vietnam he went there for more action said 
dextraze 45 
its touching that something has finaly been done for the 
fellows in canada he said it was a long time coming 
about 20000 canadians served in vietnam currently the us 
government provides some medical benefits for canadian vietnam vets

ny and color guards and a firing squad from plattsburgh air 
force base ny 
many of the vietnam vets wore their service decorations and 
camouflaged jungle uniforms 
about 300 townsfolk lined the halfmile route and applauded the 
parade when it procession arrived at the cemetery where a 
miniature replica of the vietnam war memorial in washington is to 
be erected nov 11 
the canadian forces did not send a delegation gen paul manson 
chief of defense staff told organizers in a letter last week that 
ottawa does not recognize the voluntary participation of canadians 
in foreign conflicts in which canada does not take part 
but roy one of the events main organizers said he was pleased 
with the dedication ceremonies carried out under overcast skies 
and which included a 21gun salute and two us service buglers 
blowing taps 
the only canadian government representative at the ceremony was 
from the veterans affairs department although prime minister brian 
mulroney sent a message of goodwill as did president reagan

michael dukakis had already begun to fire back at 
george bush before former aide john sasso rejoined his campaign 
but dukakis has become even more combative since his sharpened 
rhetoric bearing the stamp of the man he likens to a brother 
exiled from the campaign a year ago after admitting his role in 
the videotape that helped drive sen joseph biden from the 
presidential race sasso returned to dukakis side two weeks ago 
and the friends who gathered to welcome him back erupted in 
approval when he made a simple declaration 
there are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this 
campaign i will not shy away from pointing these contrasts out 
the return of dukakis longtime political alter ego came at a 
time when the democratic presidential nominee had lost the momentum 
he gained from his partys national convention and as he was being 
criticized for not responding aggressively to attacks from george 
bush and his fellow republicans 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
blame it on long campaign days with multiple 
stops jet lag or whatever bloopers are becoming a standard 
feature of george bushs stump speeches 
you ought to vote for me i knew about pearl harbor three 
months before it happened bush joked last week trying to take 
the edge off his mistake about the date of the japanese attack that 
led america into world war ii he had said it was on sept 7 
instead of dec 7 
since that foulup it seems that bush slips in every speech 
bush said last week that when he makes a mistake hes fair game 
for attack by dukakis and vice versa 
well foul up and hell jump on me and hell make some 
mistakes and ill jump on him but the thing is to get the issues 
out there so the american people can see them

how israeli arabs vote in the nov 1 election 
may be crucial in deciding a close vote between prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs likud bloc and foreign minister shimon peres 
labor party 
the two major parties are running neck and neck the arabs 
might well decide the election especially if they desert the labor 
party said elihu katz a pollster for the israel institute of 
applied social research 
about 330000 arabs living in israel are eligible to vote this 
year and they could control 14 or 15 seats in the 120member 
parliament if all cast ballots 
getting a feel for how arabs will vote is difficult because 
israeli pollsters do not survey palesinians in part because 
israeli opinion takers are viewed with suspicion in arab areas 
the only organized opinion sampling is by the bustani 
advertising co and its findings tended to support those of 
israeli analysts such as gutmann and katz who said the arabs would 
shun israeli parties for more radical arab ones

remember president reagans nationally 
televised pledge last january to veto future catchall spending 
bills like the 600 billion behemoth congress sent him last year 
and the promises by scores of lawmakers from both parties not to do 
it again 
guess what may be about to happen 
as the oct 1 start of the 1989 fiscal year approaches 
increasing numbers of senators and representatives and their 
aides concede that an omnibus spending bill looms as a real 
possibility 
it wouldnt be as large as last years after all two of the 13 
individual appropriations bills that finance the government have 
already been signed into law and four others have been sent to 
reagan for his signature 
but with the presidential campaign influencing much of what 
happens in washington these days and with the hopper stuffed with 
legislation congress wants to pass before leaving town next month 
a catchall spending bill may well be the result 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when their party regained control of the 
senate two years ago liberal democrats placed at the top of their 
agenda raising a minimum wage that president reagan claimed had 
caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the great 
depression 
with only seven weeks remaining until voters pick reagans 
successor his former running mate and gopdesignated heir george 
bush may have waffled just enough on the issue in the past two 
weeks for democrats to push through the first increase in the 335 
an hour wage base in eight years 
labor department figures indicate that a raise to 455 by 1991 
as proposed by senate democrats would directly benefit some 15 
million workers now paid less than that amount 
bush said again last friday that he could support a modest 
increase less than the 120 an hour over three years that 
democrats have agreed upon but only if it is coupled with a lower 
training wage

17292 
earlier this summer scores of probes reached the end of the 
assembly line at flat rock needing repairs 
mazda quality control manager james g bouck said the quality 
problems were created when a second shift was added at the plant 
a jointventure between ford and mazda and some workers were 
retrained and moved from one shift to another 
bouck who moved to mazda from general motors corp said mazda 
has more stringent quality demands than some other automakers that 
can result in more cars landing in repair lots before being shipped 
to dealers 
our repair inventory is about 300 now he said 
despite those problems probe sales have grown at a steady clip 
about 600 cars more are sold each month than in the preceding 
one no one at ford would reveal projected sales figures but 
windecker said demand has outstripped those projections 
its too early to tell exactly where probe will fit into the 
american car market 
they are creating a different niche for themselves fusco 
said but she cautioned i think you have to be really careful 
when youre creating a niche 
look what gm did with fiero she said referring to the 
pontiac twoseater that sold well in its first few years on the 
market before falling off dramatically gm stopped making the car 
earlier this year 
analysts said the probe has capitalized on the no 2 and most 
profitable automakers strengths solid design careful marketing 
and reliability 
they have done many things right said richard henderson an 
analyst with the pershing division of donaldson lufkin and 
jenrette in new york city its a combination of many many 
little factors some borrowed from europe some from north america 
and some borrowed from mazda 
combine that with a nice fit in its product mix and youve 
got a very successful car henderson said 
like other newly introduced cars probes engineering initially 
may take a back seat to its looks 
what is there out there in that price range that looks that 
neat asked fusco i think people buy cars because they look 
good and secondarily because the quality is good and the warranty 
is good 
like other fords probe carries a oneyear bumpertobumper 
warranty and a sixyear 60000mile powertrain warranty 
liz dolan of the center for auto safety an industry watchdog 
group in washington said no complaints about probe have been 
received but she said the car is too new to the market have much 
history good or bad 
probe owner michelle aiken of pleasant hill calif about 20 
miles east of san francisco has no complaints about her probe gt 
turbo 
i love it she said it seems that i get places faster 
im used to driving a van i thought i wouldnt care for it because 
it was much smaller 
in addition to the probe and the van she and her husband j 
lee aiken also have a chevrolet corvette 
the probe she said is used for family transportation her two 
children ages 9 and 12 argue over whos going to sit in front 
we have to keep a chart on our refrigerator so the children know 
whose turn it is

a group of dissident shareholders stated sunday 
it would not meet with the zenith electronics corp board of 
directors and repeated a pledge to try to dump directors and sell 
the company 
i dont think you need to go in and explain it peter c 
harkins of brookhurst partners limited partnership said of a 
meeting with zenith weve given them a specific proposal to 
enhance shareholder value sell zenith electronics corp 
on friday zenith chairman jerry k pearlman invited brookhurst 
partners which has a 61 percent stake in zenith to a sept 26 
board meeting apparently to discuss the dissidents desire to get 
new directors and sell the company 
but in a letter to pearlman made public sunday brookhurst 
partners rejected the request for a meeting the letter said zenith 
had waited too long to improve the companys bottom line so a sale 
makes sense 
it is the responsibility of the board and management to 
formulate a plan to enhance zenith share value the letter says 
after 3 years of multimilliondollar losses shareowners are 
still waiting for the details of your plan 
if zenith does not put iself on the market brookhurst partners 
wants other shareholders to vote in favor of trimming the board 
from 10 directors to six retaining three directors and electing 
three brookhurst nominees 
our nominees will then be pledged to sell the company 
harkins brookhurst partners general counsel said from new york 
zenith was closed sunday and spokesman john taylor could not be 
reached for comment on the letter 
in order to depose directors brookhurst partners is asking a 
federal judge in delaware to strike a company bylaw that says all 
shareholders not just a majority must favor such a move 
based on its 26 million common shares outstanding and a closing 
stock price of 2175 a share on friday zenith would have a market 
value of more than 565 million 
brookhurst partners formed by herbert b abelow and nicholas l 
ihasz contends the bylaw is illegal zenith a delawarechartered 
corporation is based in glenview north of chicago 
pearlman has said repeatedly since april that the board was 
exploring all options for returning the company to 
profitability 
zenith the last remaining us television manufacturer has 
been fighting a losing battle against lowpriced imported 
televisions 
despite the success of its highly regarded computers zenith 
suffered losses over the past three years including 191 million 
last year on sales of 236 billion 
weve spoken to major shareholders and theyve shared our 
views harkins said of the plan to sell the company
