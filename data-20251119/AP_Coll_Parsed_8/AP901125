the first few storms of the rainy season have 
arrived in california bringing a little moisture and a torrent of 
hope that the state will dodge a disastrous fifth year of drought 
the fouryear drought the worst in 60 years in some areas 
already has cost the nations most populous state hundreds of 
millions of dollars in losses hitting farmers the hardest 
worstcase scenarios for another dry year call for business 
shutdowns heavy crop damage wildlife losses and devastating brush 
fires lawmakers also envision one of the fiercest water wars in 
state history between cities and farmers 
the states top weather forecasters have been running numbers 
through their computers all summer and the best they can come up 
with is that nobody knows what the winter will bring 
the only thing left is to appeal to the higher being to bless 
us with rain said ralph klages a nursery owner in the los 
angeles suburb of monterey park its frustrating and its scary 
because we have a lot to lose 
the rainy season which began nov 1 has gotten off to an 
unsettling start 
a series of midnovember storms people hoped would dump lots of 
rain and snow petered out leaving precipitation levels in most 
areas well below seasonal averages 
even in the absence of storm clouds many californians see a 
silver lining water experts say the drought might accelerate water 
management plans to avoid the day fastgrowing california wants 
more water than it can get 
but many of the solutions from additional water storage to 
desalination plants are too far in the future to help most 
californians who are bracing for the worst if the inter of 1991 
comes up dry 
in the southern california mountains ski lift operators who 
have had to make do with small snow packs in the past worry that 
shrinking water supplies could even keep them from making fake 
snow 
we havent had a good snow winter in a few years said 
monica bandows with bear mountain ski resort near big bear lake 
but now there is a chance that if the lake falls below a certain 
level well no longer be able to pull water out for manmade 
snow 
ron klievoneit who operates french gulch marina on lake 
isabella in kern county said business has declined 25 percent 
since the lake level dropped some store owners have gone out of 
business he said 
a lot of them have not had enough of a cushion and have gone 
defunct said klievoneit weve owned this place for nearly 10 
years weve been successful at it and i will just have to find 
ways to be successful for years to come 
farmers also could have to find a way to get through another dry 
year 
agriculture suffered an estimated 480 million in 
droughtrelated losses this year according to the state department 
of water resources 
in california farmers get their water from several sources 
including their own wells and state and federal water projects 
unless the 1991 water year is wetter than last season farmers 
could have their government water supplies cut by onehalf to 
twothirds federal and state officials say 
tree crop farmers are having particular problems said mike 
henry spokesman for the california farm bureau federation in 
sacramento last year they started seeing trees beginning to 
stress the roots are searching for water and theyre not finding 
any the tree itself starts to change its metabolism to survive and 
not produce fruit 
urban residents also face water cutbacks state deliveries could 
drop as much as 13 percent and federal deliveries could decline 25 
percent to 50 percent officials said 
some cities already have imposed rationing most notably santa 
barbara on the hardhit central coast where some residents paint 
their dead lawns green and wash their cars with dry rags that area 
has no access to government water supplies and relies solely on 
local sources 
los angeles the states largest city had voluntary water 
conservation this summer after early success the water use inched 
back up near the end of summer and mandatory rationing next summer 
could be imposed 
a cut in water supplies to industrial users would be 
devastating a 24 percent reduction could cost los angeles industry 
25 billion and 350000 jobs according to estimates by william s 
wade a consultant to the metropolitan water district a southern 
california water broker 
electronics manufacturers for instance rely heavily on water 
and even a small cutback in their already tight supply could force 
them to reduce production 
with water in short supply the competition could turn ugly 
some lawmakers say southern californians could lobby state and 
federal water authorities to pressure central california farmers 
into giving up more of their supplies 
it could get very cannibalistic for awhile said assemblyman 
jim costa dfresno 
humans arent the only ones who suffer in a drought in the 
angeles national forest the drought is hurting wildlife by drying 
up water sources and making the plants less nutritious 
mule deer are having fewer fawns black bears are coming down 
from the hills to the campgrounds looking for food and water and 
smaller less mobile animals such as wood rats and ground squirrels 
are dying said forest biologist bill brown 
animals also have gone beyond the campgounds and into 
neighborhoods in san diego county people have reported foxes 
eating cat food raccoons slurping pool water and bobcats lurking 
around jogging trails 
the dry brush also increases the possibility of wildfire the 
state had one of its worst fires in history this summer when 
hundreds of homes were destroyed in a santa barbara area fire 
water officials say they have no idea how much precipitation the 
state can expect this winter but even a normal winter wont solve 
all the states problems they say experts say the state needs a 
wetterthannormal winter and even a second normal winter 
if we get a normal water year we can make all the state water 
deliveries said state water resources engineer bob fingado 
however that would leave our reservoirs at the same level and 
thats low 
and even after the state gets out of the current drought 
californias problems arent over the population explosion is 
straining the basic water system 
officials now are drafting longterm water plans including 
better conservation improving the coordination between water 
agencies and finding ways to reuse water 
california could become the leader in building plants that make 
sea water drinkable although a very expensive source of fresh 
water desalination facilities are under construction or in the 
planning stages in los angeles santa barbara and marin counties 
this drought should really serve to be a wakeup call for all 
of us said byron buck director of water resources planning for 
san diego county

president woodrow wilsons behavior was 
affected by decreased blood flow to the brain during his 
oftcriticized and ultimately futile campaign to have the united 
states join the league of nations a historian says 
records that were never made public show that wilson was 
disabled by illness during the critical period in us history 
after world war i said princeton university history professor 
arthur link editor of a series of volumes of wilsons papers 
it is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century link 
said in a recent interview the man who was most responsible for 
building support for the idea of a league of nations was struck 
down just as his leadership was most needed and he was struck down 
by events over which he had no control 
the 64th volume in the series to be published in february will 
reveal for the first time detailed medical records kept by dr cary 
t grayson wilsons personal physician graysons sons allowed 
link to review the 70yearold papers in may 
link said the records with analysis by medical experts explain 
wilsons poor performance in the months leading up to his 
devastating stroke in october 1919 
wilson a democrat was president from 1913 to 1921 he died in 
1924 
he won the 1919 nobel peace prize for his peacemaking efforts 
involving the league of nations after world war i however he 
failed to win us support for the league which fell apart before 
world war ii 
link said us entry into the league of nations could have 
altered history 
in a world with the united states playing a responsible 
active role the possibilities of preventing the rise of hitler 
were limitless link said 
wilson failed to get the senate to ratify us membership in the 
league because of what link said was an uncharacteristic 
unwillingness to compromise the senate wanted guarantees that the 
united states would not be subordinate to the votes of other 
nations in case of war 
in his normal healthy state wilson would have found 
compromise with the large group of moderate republicans said 
link 
instead wilson was robbed of his ability at leadership of 
his normal shrewdness and deftness of his marvelous management 
skills said link he would lose his train of thought and get 
confused he would contradict himself and eventually blow his 
cool 
against medical advice wilson then 63 took his message 
directly to the people with a speaking tour of western states in 
september 1919 the decision to go over the senates head angered 
the very lawmakers wilson needed to court 
the decision was not only irrational but in the 
circumstances was bound to be futile link writes in the 
forthcoming book 
dr james f toole director of the stroke center of the bowman 
gray school of medicine in winstonsalem nc and dr bert e 
park a springfield mo neurosurgeon analyzed the medical records 
for links book 
toole wrote that the records indicate wilson suffered from a 
disease of the carotid arteries in the neck which hindered blood 
flow to the brain and hypertension which worsened his condition 
park wrote that wilson likely continued to suffer episodes of 
internal bleeding following a 1906 stroke this could cause injury 
leading in time to recognizable behavioral disturbances that 
typified wilson from late 1919 onward park wrote 
link said the records should lay to rest the theories that 
wilsons problems were psychological 
his failure in leadership instead derived from the ravages of 
disease link said history has judged wilson as if he were a 
well man during this period

the popular belief that president woodrow 
wilsons wife ran the government after her husbands devastating 
stroke in 1919 is pure nonsense according to a historian at 
princeton university 
history professor arthur link editor of a series of volumes of 
wilsons papers said the 64th volume to be published in february 
will prove that mrs wilson served as a liaison but was not 
effectively an acting president in wilsons final year in 
office 
the volume quotes medical records and journals kept by dr cary 
t grayson wilsons personal physician and confidant graysons 
sons allowed link to review the 70yearold records in may 
it is a popular belief but it has gotten more into the realm 
of legend than scholarship said link 
edith wilson did make two crucial decisions following wilsons 
stroke link said she covered up the extent of wilsons illness 
and thwarted suggestions that he resign 
link said mrs wilson long denied being an acting president and 
once told him she was never interested in politics 
graysons journals show that mrs wilson served as a liaison 
between wilson and his advisers but that the government was run by 
his department heads link said 
wilson was president from 1913 to 1921 he suffered the stroke 
in october 1919 never fully recovered and died in 1924

civil rights advocates are questioning 
president bushs commitment to fighting discrimination despite the 
administrations aggressive prosecution of some groundbreaking 
voting rights and housing bias cases 
they cite bushs veto of the civil rights act of 1990 which 
would have made it easier for victims of discrimination to sue 
their employers 
that fallout is going to take some time to clear said drew 
days who ran the civil rights division under president carter 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights had a harsher assessment once again we have an 
administration defying the bipartisan consensus that exists on 
civil rights he said 
still civil rights leaders acknowledge there are bright spots 
in the bush administrations record 
bush actively courted black voters during the 1988 campaign 
invited coretta scott king to the republican national convention 
and spoke about healing racial divisions he is credited with 
appointing more blacks to political jobs than his predecessor 
ronald reagan 
attorney general dick thornburgh tried to reestablish ties with 
civil rights leaders that were left badly frayed by conservative 
william bradford reynolds who ran the justice departments civil 
rights division under president reagan 
he also played a major role in ensuring passage of the americans 
with disabilities act which bars discrimination against people 
with mental and physical handicaps 
the justice department also has made enforcement a priority 
adding lawyers to bring cases under a new statute that expands the 
governments authority to counter housing discrimination 
it has forced municipalities to drop restrictions against group 
homes for mentally retarded people the agency recently won a jury 
verdict against a landlord for refusing to rent apartments to a 
drug program to house recovering addicts 
the justice department filed suit to force the allmale virginia 
military institute to admit women cadets it moved to overturn 
georgias election system which it says discriminates against 
black office seekers 
when i came here it was with the understanding with the 
attorney general that i would be responsible for the vigorous and 
the complete enforcement of the civil rights laws said john 
dunne who was named assistant attorney general for civil rights 
after the senate judiciary committee blocked bushs first nominee 
william lucas 
no matter what the subject area we have been extremely 
aggressive dunne said 
civil rights advocates want more 
they are going to have to make a record across the board its 
not going to be sufficient to carve out enclaves where they are 
vigorous and leaving others untouched and uncared for days said 
neas says he finds very few substantive differences in 
justice department policy from the reagan administration when it 
was headed by attorney general edwin meese iii 
and on many major issues of dispute involving the 1990 civil 
rights bill the thornburgh justice department was much worse 
than the meese justice department neas said 
thornburgh strikes you as being the planet jupiter a failed 
star you would have anticipated much more from him said barbara 
arnwine an attorney for the lawyers committee for civil rights 
under law 
the bill bush vetoed would have restored an evolving legal 
standard dating back 18 years for discrimination cases involving 
employer policies that have a disparate impact on women and 
minorities 
bush said it would spawn hiring quotas by encouraging businesses 
to employ and promote minorities simply to avoid costly court 
suits 
civil rights lawyers accuse the president of using divisive 
rhetoric to mischaracterize the bill which contained language 
stating that no provision was designed to promote quotas 
its dividing people when this was the president who was going 
to try to heal those divisions said william taylor a washington 
civil rights lawyer 
both taylor and arnwine charge that the bush administration 
wants to eliminate disparate impact cases to protect business 
from the costs of discrimination suits 
they believe that if somebody didnt intend to discriminate 
they shouldnt be held accountable arnwine said 
dunne rejected this view providing figures showing that the 
since bush took office the civil rights division has brought nine 
disparateimpact suits against state and local governments 
but civil rights activists contend that the department wastes 
valuable time and resources pursuing reverse discrimination cases 
such as a recent lawsuit accusing the maryland lottery commission 
of discriminating against white males by setting aside 12 positions 
for women and minorities 
we dont apologize for bringing reverse discrimination 
cases said roger clegg one of dunnes deputies who also served 
in the reagan administration the law requires us to enforce the 
law in an evenhanded fashion 
the bitterness that lingers following bushs veto is fueled by 
charges that the administration failed to bargain in good faith 
with the bills supporters 
the sense of many in the civil rights community is that the 
administration strung people along giving them the sense there 
really was room for negotiations and compromise when there really 
wasnt days said 
the administration is going to have to work very hard to 
reestablish its good faith he said

less than two years ago south 
africa and eastern europe shunned each other as ideological 
villains 
today the south africans have diplomatic or trade arrangements 
with poland romania and hungary and are expanding contacts with 
the soviet union and czechoslovakia 
dramatic political and social changes on both sides have made 
them eager to renew relations after decades of enmity over 
communism and apartheid 
we were at the other end of the world both geographically and 
ideologically foreign minister rf botha said on a trip to 
czechoslovakia after the changes in both parts of the world 
there is nothing which divides our governments 
botha and czechoslovak officials announced plans to establish 
lowlevel diplomatic ties after a 27year hiatus in august trade 
minister kent durr became the first south african cabinet member to 
visit the soviet union in 34 years 
ideology drove the two sides apart in the 1950s and 1960s 
economics is bringing them together in the 1990s 
the south african government invoked the threat of a communist 
takeover for decades as justification for suppressing the black 
opposition 
this year president fw de klerk legalized all opposition 
groups released african national congress leader nelson mandela 
from prison after 27 years and promised to end the apartheid system 
of racial segregation 
one of de klerks objectives was to end international sanctions 
which have isolated south africa economically and politically 
east european countries supported the sanctions and backed the 
anc and its ally the south african communist party 
then in 1989 came the upheaval that dismembered the soviet 
bloc and swept communist parties from power in moscows former 
satellites those nations are struggling to rebuild their crumbling 
economies and have found a willing trade partner in south africa 
although they still oppose apartheid east european countries 
have switched from being the main financial support of the anc to 
dealing with the white government it sought to destroy 
delegations from eastern europe visit south africa regularly 
permananent representatives have been exchanged and trade 
agreements signed thousands of eastern european and soviet 
citizens have applied to south african embassies in western europe 
for permission to immigrate 
i am pleased that the dynamics of late 20th century political 
transformation are bringing our two nations once again closer 
together durr said in opening the first polish trade fair in 
south africa 
poland dropped trade restrictions against south africa on march 
9 the day after durr completed a visit in late october the 
governments signed an agreement to establish reciprocal offices of 
interest 
polish government and trade officials traveled to south africa 
for the twoweek trade fair which featured nearly 50 manufacturers 
of products ranging from heavy machinery through textiles to vodka 
organizers said contracts worth 60 million were signed 
the visitors emphasized their continued opposition to apartheid 
but it was clear that relations had been made more palatable by 
polands economic problems and south africas reforms 
poland is heavily in debt and is beginning to make its 
economic relations with the rest of the world much more active 
said andrzej zawislak an economist and member of parliament 
zawislak said some western countries had urged poland not to 
establish ties with south africa but did not identify them 
romania and south africa signed an agreement last month for a 
joint trade committee that would meet annually and specific trade 
contracts are expected 
south africa has opened a permanent office in hungary to 
represent its interests and hungary plans to reciprocate 
hungarian officials said their country still opposes apartheid 
but wants the office because about 20000 people of hungarian 
descent live in south africa 
african nations also are warming to south africas reforms only 
malawi has full diplomatic relations but several have trade 
missions in pretoria and de klerk has visited seven african 
countries since taking office in august 1989 
his government says it trades with every african country mostly 
in secret 
mandela has sought funds for the anc in africa western europe 
the united states and asia but has yet to visit eastern europe or 
the soviet union which provided most of the movements military 
aid while he was imprisoned

players wore names like killer 
rocky and spaz on their jerseys cheerleaders in combat boots 
shouted through orange pylons and waved pink paper pompons 
spectators stacked their rifles and gas masks to do the wave 
this was sunday afternoon football with a twist the players 
were women 
a team of marines called the wrecking crew toppled the desert 
foxes from us navy fleet hospital no 5 2013 in front of 
adoring troops who roared howled barked and booed the referees 
naturally 
its a change of pace everyone was able to blow off a little 
steam said marine cpl carrie cripps 21 of fort smith ark a 
middle linebacker she is also known as rocky 
the desert foxes were weary and dirty but far from discouraged 
because they stayed within a touchdown of the women marines the 
foxes had practiced only eight times before all on an asphalt 
parking lot 
were all nurses we didnt know the first thing about 
football i thought we were going to get trounced said lt com 
raelene hoogendorn of mcdonald pa also known as killer she works 
in casualty receiving 
this wasnt the nfl but it was the closest thing available in 
saudi arabia the game is called flag football a version of touch 
although there were more than a few tackles and there was some 
crisp blocking players traded highfive handshakes and spiked the 
ball on touchdown receptions 
the game was played on a sand field that the marines call the 
scud bowl although this one was billed as the turkey bowl as part 
of thanksgiving weekend every play kicked up a cloud of dust and 
the women panted and puffed in the 90degree heat 
armed forces radio did a playbyplay several hundred marines 
watched from the sidelines some sitting on their sleeping cots or 
under tent flaps they munched on popcorn pretzels and crackers 
there was no beer only koolaid and soda pop although the two 
sidelines chanted the miller lite exchange of less filling and 
tastes great before the game 
all in all it was a pleasant afternoon for service members who 
have been training in this parched land for nearly four months 
nobodys in their tents it breaks the monotony said 
gunnery sgt eugene bradley 33 of dallas its something to do 
on a sunday tomorrow we go back to work back to the old grind 
boy look at those linebackers 
sgt chris dempsey 25 of cleveland led other marines in 
cheers 
when the women play people come out of the woodwork to 
watch dempsey said there aint no place to go you cant go 
to town theres no alchohol were pretty well isolated 
the game would also be unheard of elsewhere in saudi arabia 
where men and women may not mingle in public even photographs of 
women playing sports are almost unheard of 
this is a crowd pleaser you cant get no better than this 
said lance cpl stephen banks 22 of pittsburgh 
on the other side of the field cpl greg williams 22 of 
billings mont screamed himself hoarse while waving his pompoms 
theres not much to do out here said williams 
capt richard mayo commander of fleet no 5 hospital wished 
his carges well before they took the field in their white tshirts 
adorned with red crosses a contrast to the marines drab brown 
shirts 
this is one way of channeling their frustrations mayo said 
from the bench 
as befits a multinational force a number of british soldiers 
watched the game 
i love american football love the atmosphere said cpl 
mick gibbons 28 you dont have the rowdies we have in british 
soccer 
about 350000 troops are in saudi arabia as part of a 
multinational force deployed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
they face about 460000 iraqi troops in southern iraq and kuwait

six weeks after the smoke and sting of tear gas 
drifted away from the wailing wall and dome of the rock anger and 
recrimination remain from the bloody riot at the sites sacred to 
jews and moslems 
israel still is trying to block a un investigation of the 
deaths of at least 17 arabs killed by police gunfire 
hatred has grown on both sides the oct 8 riots brought revenge 
stabbings by arabs and renewed fervor in the 3yearold palestinian 
uprising then came stonings by jews and growing calls that arab 
workers be barred from israel 
passage of time and a half dozen investigations by israelis and 
arabs show that first accounts of the temple mount tragedy from 
israeli officials and from palestinians drew more on anger than 
accuracy 
the findings conflict with israeli assertions that the arabs 
deliberately provoked trouble by raining thousands of stones on 
tens of thousands of worshipers at the wailing wall 
even the governments own inquiry concluded that the melee began 
with stones thrown at police on temple mount not at jews near the 
wall which also is called the western wall because it forms the 
western base of temple mount 
the commission headed by former secret service chief zvi zamir 
listed nine jewish civilians hurt by stones a toll inconsistent 
with first reports of a barrage rained down on worshipers 
on the palestinian side there is no evidence for initial 
charges that an israeli helicopter fired tear gas and guns at 
moslems on temple mount 
accusations of a planned provocation by palestinians or a 
premeditated wellplanned operation by israel do not mesh with 
what is now known 
chaos not planning characterized the riot 
zamirs commission notes that police lost communication with 
each other some did not hear orders and there was unsupervised 
gunfire by some officers 
many moslem witnesses said later they did not understand why the 
rioting started israeli officials first accused palestinians of 
carrying rocks to temple mount to start a riot the zamir report 
did not repeat that charge and all accounts now say the stones 
were lying around at a construction project 
betselem an israeli human rights group said information 
given the public was for the most part imprecise raising the 
suspicion that attempts were made to hide facts and evade 
responsibilty 
there probably never will be complete agreement on what 
happened the zamir commission did not have subpoena powers and 
said it interviewed few palestinian witnesses palestinian accounts 
discounted the police version 
israelis and palestinians also saw the confrontation from their 
own side of the wall and their own point of view 
the riot came on a day of high emotion up to 30000 jews had 
gathered at the wailing wall for the sukkot festival jews revere 
the wall as the last remnant of the ancient jewish temple 
as many as 5000 moslems had gathered in the walled compound 
above the wall the area known in arabic as the haram essharif or 
noble enclosure it is islams thirdholiest site and contains 
the dome of the rock and al aqsa mosque 
the moslems were incensed by rumors that a jewish extremist 
group the temple mount faithful planned a march on the holy 
sanctuary the group founded after the capture of arab east 
jerusalem from jordan wants to rebuild the ancient jewish temple 
on the mount 
authorities had barred them from temple mount but allowed a 
rally nearby fueling moslem fears of an intrusion 
the riots began about 1045 am when the priestly sukkot 
benediction was over and the jewish worshipers were dispersing from 
the plaza in front of the wailing wall 
according to the betselem group of liberal lawyers and 
professors violence started when palestinian youths threw stones 
at police in a courtyard near the dome of the rock 
those in the plaza cannot see what is happening up on temple 
mount and people on the plateau around the dome of the rock cannot 
see directly down on the plaza because of the wall 
police responded with tear gas betselem noted that thousands of 
moslems could not see the stone throwing and grew angry at the 
sudden use of tear gas 
indeed two palestinian reports found no evidence of stone 
throwing before the tear gassing the zamir report mentions neither 
stonings nor tear gas at this point 
its account of the rioting begins and others call this the 
next step with an angry mob charging police on the temple mount 
some rioters attacked a small police station manned by two men 
others threw rocks and metal objects at police near one wall the 
interior of the jews wailing wall which is at least 20 feet high 
inside temple mount 
early reports said the rioting started after cries of kill the 
jews came from mosque loudspeakers palestinians deny there was 
such a cry and the zamir report is ambiguous on the point 
according to the 50page englishlanguage version of the report 
the cry was heard from a loudspeaker elsewhere however it 
says the cry was among shouts heard from the direction of the 
mosques 
police answered the rocks with tear gas and rubber bullets at 
least one officer fired live ammunition into the air police were 
overwhelmed and fled the walled compound 
palestinians say live ammunition was then fired at rioters from 
a police station overlooking the area betselem says gunfire was 
probably used the zamir report says there was no intentional 
firing of live ammunition at this point 
the remaining jewish worshipers were evacuated from the plaza at 
the wailing wall this appears to account for the few injuries 
while some of the first rocks cleared the wall around temple 
mount and fell on the plaza below both the zamir and betselem 
reports describe the heavy barrage of stones coming after police 
fled and the jewish worshipers left the wailing wall 
a little after 11 am police charged back into the compound 
palestinians say they came in shooting the zamir report says they 
opened fire only after the mob refused to retreat 
the commissions report says use of live ammunition was 
justified by danger to the policemens lives their fear for the 
safety of jewish worshipers and for the lives of the two officers 
still in the station on the mount 
in fact the two policemen had taken refuge with mosque guards 
and were safe but the police did not know that because of a 
communications breakdown 
the zamir commission said it was doubtful all the gunfire was 
needed noting that using live ammunition had been justified only 
for policemen who were in mortal danger 
betselem said police fired indiscriminately using bursts of 
automatic weapons fire and shooting at ambulances and palestinian 
rescue workers

the dollar the hated and admired symbol of 
american power is the currency of choice on the streets of 
baghdad where un sanctions have rattled the already shaky iraqi 
economy 
in everincreasing numbers iraqis approach foreigners risking 
lengthy prison sentences to buy dollars at blackmarket rates that 
have almost doubled in three months 
at the same time some merchants play the dangerous game of 
asking customers to give them something other than the new 25dinar 
notes bearing the likeness of president saddam hussein 
western diplomats suggested that reflects a fear the dinar could 
lose its value if saddam is toppled after a usled attack or in a 
coup 
the common man is concerned about his future and the future of 
his family he recognizes the possibility that saddam might fail 
and places his bets accordingly said one asian diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
at official rates one iraqi dinar is worth 3 in iraq but on 
the streets of baghdad one dollar can buy five iraqi dinars and in 
some outlying areas the going rate is reportedly six or seven 
dinars 
its a dollar economy said one european diplomat also 
speaking on condition of anonymity there isnt much you cant 
buy with dollars you can buy your way out of the country or you 
can buy your way out of the army 
one western diplomat said some major figures in the iraqi 
business world are turning vast amounts of their assets into cash 
and turning that cash into dollars 
the weakness of the dinar is not linked to the weakness of the 
government but to the weakness of the economy the dinars a paper 
currency based on the oil and oil is not being sold the asian 
diplomat said 
before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the subsequent un 
embargo the country earned more than 95 percent of its foreign 
exchange from oil exports 
sanctions are already hurting on that i have no doubts the 
asian diplomat said almost the entire industrial sector has 
either ground to a halt or is chuggling along very slowly 
shortages of spare parts imported raw materials and foreign 
technical expertise have left much of iraqs industry running at 
only a maintenance level western diplomats said 
prices on everything from cigarettes to tires are soaring in the 
marketplace cigarettes that just three months ago cost onethird 
of a dinar now cost 350 dinars tires now cost 300 dinars apiece 
or 900 at the official rate 
the level of frustration on the street is amazing everyone in 
the country has his life on hold said one european diplomat 
food is still in abundant supply in iraq much of it smuggled in 
from iran or looted from kuwait store shelves overflow with 
consumer goods and delicacies still in their kuwaiti packaging 
despite official iraqi complaints about shortages of medicines 
doctors in baghdad say theres no problem with supplies western 
diplomats suggest iraqi attempts to acquire more medicine in 
exchange for hostages is an attempt to bolster stockpiles for war 
last week the government announced a new decree imposing the 
death sentence on people convicted of hoarding food 
some diplomats believe it is aimed mainly at discouraging 
largescale smuggling others believe the government itself is 
heavily involved in the smuggling and simply wants to excercise 
more control on consumption distribution and profiteering 
western and asian diplomats say they cannot accurately assess 
how long iraq can hold out under the pressure of sanctions alone 
i dont think one can set a time limit said one asian 
diplomat you have to take into account the way this society 
functions 
theres no way for the people to express their unhappiness 
with the government but on the other hand saddam hussein and the 
leadership all realize that they can push the people only so far 
he added 
one western diplomat was more blunt in his assessment of the 
sanctions theyll not work in time to avoid war

all sharon russell ever wanted to be 
was a nurse but her weight nearly got in the way 
after she was kicked out of nursing school in 1985 weighing 
more than 300 pounds she sued the school and won now the case has 
moved to the us supreme court and shes moved to the forefront in 
the fight for dignity for overweight people 
its going to take time its going to take patience ms 
russell said and its going to take people like me who have the 
guts to stand up and say i was humiliated this is how i 
felt 
a federal jury last year ordered salve regina college of 
newport ri to pay ms russell nearly 44000 in damages an 
appeals court upheld the judgment and the school appealed its case 
to the nations high court 
the justices this week will hear arguments to decide a narrow 
procedural point of law relating to the appeals courts standard of 
review 
although the decision expected sometime next year will have 
little bearing on the legal question of socalled size 
discrimination it could determine whether the award must be paid 
the important thing is more people will understand what i had 
to go through to get to this point said ms russell now 26 and 
a pediatric nurse at all childrens hospital in st petersburg 
ms russell maintains size discrimination was the sole reason 
for her dismissal from salve regina but school officials argue she 
was unhealthy because she suffered from an eating disorder and was 
physically unable to handle patients 
we dont dismiss students because theyre fat said 
catherine graziano salve reginas dean of nursing we dismiss 
students if they have behavior problems that make them unable to 
function as nurses 
ms russell said her 5foot6 300pound body didnt seem to 
bother administrators in 1982 when she was accepted at the small 
college run by the roman catholic sisters of mercy 
after earning good grades through her freshman and sophomore 
years she entered the colleges nursing program her problems 
began the first day 
my instructor took one look at me and said were not going 
to get a uniform to fit you youll never get around a bed she 
said 
she said she was used as a human guinea pig in class to show 
students how to make a bed with a fat person or how to give a shot 
to a fat person 
i would sit there and pretend it didnt bother me she said 
but it was just killing me inside 
in december 1984 faculty members presented ms russell with a 
contract to lose two pounds a week or face dismissal and signed it 
because becoming a nurse was all i ever wanted 
according to the school ms russell weighed 328 pounds at the 
beginning of her sophomore year was down to 297 when she signed 
the agreement and back up to 303 during the summer of 1985 that 
was when salve regina notified ms russell she would not be allowed 
to attend her senior year 
with that ms russell slapped salve regina and five faculty 
members with a 2 million federal lawsuit alleging among other 
things handicap discrimination intentional infliction of 
emotional distress invasion of privacy and breach of contract 
the judge dismissed all claims except the breach of contract 
allegation 
a providence jury sided with ms russell saying the school 
broke its implied contract to provide her with an education so long 
as she paid her tuition maintained good grades and wasnt a 
discipline problem 
the award reflected the cost of having to repeat her junior year 
at st josephs college in west hartford conn and the lost 
earnings from spending an extra year in school 
in upholding the verdict the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
noted the school forced ms russell out of school because she was 
obese and for no other reason 
save reginas lawyer steven snow disagreed if we did 
anything wrong it was in giving her too many chances 
ms russell completed her nursing studies at st josephs and 
has been working in st petersburg for 2 years she had her 
stomach surgically stapled in one of her many failed attempts to 
slim down 
asked how she was doing at st petersburg a hospital 
spokeswoman said sunday i know that she is in a supervisory 
position so that speaks for itself 
shes become an active fighter against size discrimination and 
was the keynote speaker for the 3000member national association 
to advance fat acceptance her message is simple 
accept yourself the way you are work with what you have go 
for it and live your life my attitude is i weigh 285 pounds now 
get over it

jim fitzgerald bounded into the new 
branch office of the brattleboro savings amp loan association doffed 
his sneakers for shiny brown shoes and tucked in his shirt 
it was a high school seniors best effort to look like a banker 
fellow brattleboro union high school senior amy kinsman was 
already behind her tellers window tidying things up and getting 
ready for the expected friday rush of teachers cashing their 
paychecks 
i didnt even know id be doing this at the beginning of the 
year said fitzgerald 17 who is eyeing a college major in 
finance or economics 
the goal of the high schools career center is to merge school 
and the real world 
a proposal by a marketing class to install condom machines in 
high school restrooms was shot down last spring undaunted career 
center director william dennen pushed ahead with a day care center 
for the children of teenage mothers and with vermonts first high 
school bank 
it was an idea that dennen and business teacher bruce bergeron 
had been kicking around for about three years 
wouldnt it be great if we could really get a bank working 
down here dennen recalled the two saying to one another no 
roleplaying the real thing 
a realthing bank might eventually issue the mortgage on the 
house built by each years construction trades class and it would 
give the students in bergerons advanced accounting class a shot a 
handling real money 
a good vocational center is supposed to parallel whats in 
the community dennen said sure enough the house built by last 
years construction trades class languishes on the market in a new 
englandwide real estate slump 
and sure enough the hallway off the high schools cafeteria 
looks a bit like main street theres the day care center a flower 
shop run by horticulture students a restaurant run by cooking 
students a store run by retailing students and now the bank 
business management teacher maribeth cornell said she especially 
likes the bank cornell used to have to try to get off work on time 
every other friday and fight traffic to the heart of downtown to 
deposit her paycheck 
now she walks down the hall to the banks new buhs career center 
branch and hands her check to student tellers kinsman or 
fitzgerald 
im a customer who reaps the convenience of it she said 
after cashing her check last friday she said she marvels at the 
services available at the high school 
about the only thing we dont have is a place to get your hair 
cut she said with a laugh we need that 
after thinking about a student bank for some time dennen and 
the career center staff held a luncheon for local bankers and laid 
out their proposal 
robert schrull 36yearold president of the brattleboro savings 
amp loan jumped at the idea well do it he said that was on a 
thursday schrull got the ok from his board on friday and gave the 
formal goahead to the school on the following monday 
the little guy came through dennen said of the savings amp 
loan all the others were sort of reluctant 
the state came through with a 5000 grant the bank invested 
20000 the schools building trades program helped with the 
construction and the electronics class wired the alarm and security 
camera systems a 27yearold customer service representative at 
the brattleboro savings was named branch manager 
twelve of the 13 students in bergerons advanced accounting 
class sent resumes to schrull he interviewed all 12 and sent them 
letters giving pointers on their resumes and interview styles 
while kinsman and fitzgerald got the two initial openings 
eventually all 12 students who applied will get a stint behind the 
tellers windows 
brattleboro savings amp loan keeps it simple it doesnt deal in 
junk bonds or highstakes real estate investments just savings and 
checking accounts certificates of deposit and home mortgages for 
brattleboro area residents 
a small bank like schrulls needs the support of its community 
dennen said it made as much sense for the bank to try to make 
friends with students at the high school many of whom would be 
shopping for mortgage loans in 10 or 15 years as for the school 
to get it students experience in banking

landowners in eastern maine are angered 
by the illegal stripping of branches from trees by brush rustlers 
who sell their booty to wreath makers 
some people will do anything for a buck said leslie 
thornton assistant regional ranger for maines forest service 
as the price of brush has gone up more people are doing this 
along us route 1 in jonesboro bright yellow signs warn 
tippers those who gather branch tips from balsam trees to 
stay off property unless they have permission 
roadblocks along secondary roads have been set up to check the 
tippers harvests and details patrol back roads to discourage 
illegal tipping 
what was once a way for kids to earn a few bucks is now a big 
business 
douglas getchell a 39yearold forest service ranger in 
whitneyville gathered tips in burlap bags and sold them for 3 or 4 
cents a pound when he was a child now the going rate for tips is 
about 20 or 30 cents a pound and a good tipper can earn more than 
200 a day 
about 2 million wreaths a year are produced in eastern maine 
making the area the wreath capital of the nation and pumping an 
estimated 15 million to 18 million into the local economy 
most of the land in the region is owned by champion and 
georgiapacific corp each of which owns about 450000 acres for 
a 40 fee georgiapacific lets anyone take branch tips from its 
land champion meanwhile divides its land in large blocks of 300 
to 3000 acres and auctions rights to tippers bids range from 300 
to 1000 
rangers say illegal tippers usually have permits from paper 
companies or written permission from private landowners to gathers 
tips but often move onto other land where brush is more plentiful 
the vast forests and zigzagging property lines across hundreds 
of thousands of acres makes enforcement difficult six rangers 
patrol the 15 millionacre district in washington county 
tippers often carry a gun to make it appear theyre hunting 
sometimes ill catch them with sticks of tips nearby and 
theyll say its not mine im out here hunting getchell 
said 
greg antil of jonesboro and some friends last year pooled 1000 
to buy the tipping rights on a prime block of championowned land 
only to have brush rustlers tip a portion of the fullbodied trees 
he said tipping on land where rights have been purchased by 
others is like stealing their money nine times out of 10 theyll 
get away with it he said

freemarket reforms have tripled the 
prices of many items but they are scarce anyway food sometimes is 
harder to find than in the starvation days of communist 
dictatorship 
life is surely more miserable now than under ceausescu said 
pascu dumitrescu a 68yearold pensioner pointing to empty stalls 
in a public market the shops are a reflection of our lives 
after a long search dumitrescu found a store that had bread 
waited in line with other sullen shoppers and bought a bag of stale 
loaves 
people will no longer stand it said an angry man of 60 
they are going to take to the streets again but this time 
theyll be demanding food 
when the government imposed price increases nov 1 to push the 
country toward a market economy it agreed to freeze the prices of 
such basic food items as bread milk and meat until jan 1 
it also temporarily froze rents and energy prices 
controlled prices dont make food any easier to find poorly 
paid store employees sometimes sell subsidized food to black 
marketeers the government said last week it would prosecute anyone 
caught doing so 
leather shoes underwear and spare auto parts are a only 
memories refrigerators televisions radios and toilet paper are 
impossible to find without special connections 
romanians endured years of harsh rationing under communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu who exported everything possible in 
order to pay off the foreign debt 
when they began the protests last december that led to his 
downfall and execution many assumed prosperity would follow 
automatically 
the new national salvation front government diverted food 
intended for export to domestic use after the revolution that 
combined with donations from the west created the illusion of 
relative plenty at the beginning 
it didnt last even though prices are higher now shops offer 
the same paltry selection of food most of it canned as they did 
under ceausescu 
in the farmers markets where food is available sellers raised 
their prices long ago without waiting for the government 
marian nitu the deputy agriculture and food minister estimated 
in an interview that food exports totaled about 20 million so far 
this year 
along with livestock he said vegetables fruits and canned 
beef were going to buyers in the west and far east all are hard 
to find in local markets 
nicolae tache director of the public market where dumitrescu 
was shopping said meat had not been available for more than a week 
and blamed what he called a corrupt government distribution system 
i have to bribe for delivery contracts to be honored he 
said 
at another market in the main bucharest district of pajura more 
than 50 people lined up for butter others waited silently for 
small rations of sugar 
rumors that a milk van was arriving spread through the crowdand 
another long line formed at the milk shop 
the only available meat was six pig feet coated with fine hairs 
and laid out on a dirty shelf in a food shop that also offered 
2yearold cans of squash vegetable puree and spinach 
most shoppers bought halffilled bottles of mineral water the 
driest summer in years added tap water to the list of scarce 
commodities 
for most romanians it will be another christmas without the 
turkey pork fresh feta cheese apple cake and wine some remember 
from better times 
i am terrified by the coming days said maria radoi one of 
the shoppers

the united states failed on saturday to persuade colombia and 
malaysia immediately to back a proposed un resolution authorizing 
force against iraq but us officials said the resolution would be 
presented to the security council this week 
president bush who returned from europe early saturday said he 
was confident of broad support for the proposed resolution 
secretary of state james a baker iii who has been lobbying 
world leaders for votes is expected to preside over the debate 
when the foreign ministers of most of the 15 council members 
assemble at the united nations at midweek the us officials said 
on condition of anonymity 
the malaysian foreign minister who met with baker in los 
angeles told reporters he believed the meeting on the resolution 
would take place thursday the los angeles times also reported in 
sundays editions that the resolution would probably be presented 
thursday 
the united states wants a meeting before the end of november

past 
the washington post reported sunday that the united states began 
distributing a draft of a proposed resolution to the other four

not specifically use the word force 
the paper quoted diplomatic sources as saying they believe the 
draft seeks to avoid objections to that term by using such phrases 
as all necessary means

won the release of relatives held in iraq and president saddam 
hussein promised to free a large number of italians

the bush administration will try this week to 
win un security council approval of a resolution authorizing the 
use of force to end the iraqi occupation of kuwait if peaceful

persian gulf policy 
before meeting with hassan saturday baker visited bogota 
colombia but failed to win immediate support from colombian 
officials for a resolution authorizing force to oust iraqi troops 
from kuwait 
the united states onemonth presidency of the security council 
ends friday yemen expected to oppose a resolution against iraq 
will take over for december 
in beijing spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
said saturday the security council could pass the proposed

kuwait will make its presentation against iraq on monday and 
tuesday the focus then shifts under bakers guidance to the 
resolution authorizing force the usbacked resolution would be 
the toughest step taken by the council against iraq since the aug 
2 invasion 
the positions of the soviet union and china appeared uncertain 
but us officials did not expect the two powers to block a 
resolution officials expected that the two would try to soften the 
us approach before it was put to a test vote 
the five security council members with veto powers are britain 
china france the soviet union and the united states 
the soviet unions un envoy also said friday that foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze would attend a security council 
meeting this week to discuss iraqi aggression and to issue a 
strong serious and precise warning to baghdad 
only cuba is considered a sure bet to vote against the 
resolution the bush administration wants the most lopsided tally 
possible to demonstrate to iraqi president saddam hussein that the 
drive to liberate kuwait has widespread support 
the soviet union and china have not ruled out force a senior 
us official declining to be identified said earlier this month 
that the two countries had given assurances they would not block 
such a resolution 
yet soviet president mikhail s gorbachev gave no direct 
assurances to president bush at their meeting last week how the 
soviets would vote 
from the outset gorbachev has put more stress than bush on 
seeking a diplomatic solution to the crisis and has sent his top 
mideast specialist yevgeny primakov on missions to baghdad

a gunman who infiltrated from egypt sprayed 
four israeli vehicles with assault rifle fire sunday killing four 
people and wounding 24 the army said 
the army said the lone gunman killed three israeli army soldiers 
and a civilian driver for the national egged bus company on the 
israeliegyptian border about 15 miles northwest of the israeli 
red sea resort of eilat 
the gunman escaped back into egypt a senior egyptian security 
source said an egyptian border policeman assigned to the area of 
the attack had been arrested as the suspected assailant earlier 
reports from cairo said the gunman had fired from the egyptian side 
of the border 
in amman jordan a fundamentalist islamic group sunday claimed 
responsibility for the attack the extremist islamic jihadbeit 
almaqdes or islamic holy warjersualem said the attack was 
carried out by one of our units operating in the land of arabism 
and islam the land of egypt 
defense minister moshe arens called the attack a most serious 
incident and said israel expected egypt to take all the necessary 
steps to prevent such assaults 
a military commander identified only as brig gen d said on 
army radio that an egyptian man whose identity is not clear to us 
at this moment infiltrated into israel at the distance of about 
300 yards from the scene of the shooting 
he entered a dry riverbed reached the road and lay in wait on 
the roadside the commander said 
the assailant opened fire on an army van containing just the 
driver who was injured but carried on for a few hundred yards and 
stopped 
another military car also containing only one person and 
heading from eilat to a nearby base was hit by several bullets 
the soldier inside was mortally wounded drove for a few hundred 
yards and died the commander said 
next came a military bus the driver thought there had been an 
accident and stopped he got out with his weapon but was shot dead 
at very close range before he could fire back 
finally the attacker fired on an egged bus carrying civilians 
working at military installations in the area he wounded a 
security guard who shot back hitting the assailant 
we found signs of blood showing that he was hit i think this 
prevented a heavier tragedy the commander said the terrorist 
apparently intended to board the bus and take it over he the 
guard did not let him come on board he climbed down through the 
door and shot him and from that moment the terrorist began running 
away 
reporters at the scene saw a red and white passenger bus with 
its windshield covered with bullet holes police forensic experts 
were seen picking up bullets around the bus 
isaac barmoshe press officer at the israeli embassy in cairo 
said the gunman had used a sovietmade kalashnikov semiautomatic 
rifle 
if the attack was indeed committed by a member of egypts 
uniformed forces it would be the second on oct 5 1985 an 
egyptian border police officer went berserk and shot dead four 
israeli children two women and an elderly man near the border in 
the sinai desert 
before sunday the latest attack on an israeli target in egypt 
was on feb 4 when gunmen ambushed a tour bus killing nine 
israeli vacationers the attack took place on a desert road between 
cairo and the suez canal city of ismailiya 
egypt is the only arab state to have a peace treaty with israel 
after the treaty was signed in 1979 israel began withdrawing from 
the egyptian sinai peninsula which it occupied in 1967 
between 1984 and 1987 two israeli diplomats and six israelis 
were wounded in cairo in a number of attacks claimed by an egyptian 
terrorist organization egypts revolution

chinas first laboratories for capitalist reform 
four coastal enclaves that have attracted both investment and 
corruption celebrate their 10th anniversary monday uncertain of 
their role in the 1990s 
when shenzhen zhuhai shantou and xiamen were designated 
chinas first special economic zones in 1980 senior leader deng 
xiaoping was just starting his program of shaking up the 
inefficient centrally planned economy 
deng wanted to experiment with limited free markets 
westernstyle management and foreigninvested joint ventures but 
he worried about the flies and mosquitoes western social and 
political values that would come in the new open window 
the answer was special zones areas set apart for foreign 
investment or in the case of shenzhen created for it 
shenzhen an hours train ride from hong kong was mostly rice 
paddies in 1980 it had 30000 residents and no traffic lights 
now it has 15 million residents and its highrise neonlit 
skyline is modeled on hong kong it has become the biggest and 
bestknown special economic zone home to nearly onefifth of the 
10000 foreigninvested companies operating in china 
huge celebrations might have been expected for the zones 10th 
birthday instead there almost was no celebration at all the real 
birthdate in august was ignored and festivities were scheduled 
for this week only at the last minute 
shenzhen officials invited communist party general secretary 
jiang zemin to attend but there has been no word on whether he 
will go 
the national media have said little about the anniversary the 
shenzhen special zone daily has reported local meetings to discuss 
the anniversarys guiding ideology and has published 15 
approved slogans for the day 
work hard for new achievements in building a socialist 
spiritual civilization reads one 
the whole nation supports the special economic zones the 
special economic zones serve the whole nation 
beijing authorities fear the zones especially shenzhen have 
been contaminated by capitalist values and have failed to 
contribute enough of their newfound wealth to the rest of the 
nation 
shenzhen has become notorious for higher levels of prostitution 
gambling and crime than most chinese cities workers hired by 
contract rather than for life as is customary elsewhere in china 
work harder are paid better and spend more freely 
an anything goes atmosphere prevails one hotel even opened 
a casino in 1985 even though all gambling is illegal in china 
authorities quickly shut it down 
chinese entering shenzhen need special travel permits as if for 
a foreign country still the government fears the flies and 
mosquitoes have gotten out of hand at a meeting in shenzhen in 
february premier li peng called on the zones to show a new image 
of socialist culture and morals 
communist party leader jiang warned they are not special 
political zones 
critics in beijing also say the zones prosperity has not 
trickled back to inland regions that supply them with raw 
materials many products exported by the zones are made inland but 
the zones take a cut of the profits for their transit 
dozens of other cities now offer incentives to foreign 
investors such as tax waivers and longterm land leases that 
rival what the zones can offer other cities also have been 
designated to experiment with new reforms such as converting 
housing to private ownership 
the strongest blow to the zones special place came in 1989 
when their main patron party general secretary zhao ziyang was 
ousted for allegedly supporting prodemocracy protests 
since then the reshuffled party leadership under jiang has made 
shanghai and the yangtze river valley the centerpiece of 
development plans jiang was party secretary in shanghai before 
being named to succeed zhao 
a fifth special enterprise zone hainan island off the southern 
coast was established in 1988 with zhaos backing jiang and li 
both have said there will be no more 
we must first concentrate our strength to run the currently 
existing special zones well jiang told a hong kong magazine in 
september

president carlos salinas de gortari welcomes 
president bush to his hometown monday for a discussion expected to 
center on developing closer relations through trade 
the two nations are negotiating a free trade agreement which 
salinas hopes will help mexico grow out of the third world into the 
ranks of developed nations 
bush is to arrive in monterrey at about noon and travel 55 miles 
by helicopter to agualeguas the salinas family hometown of 5000 
people where they will attend a rodeo and meet privately for two 
hours they plan to return to monterrey afterward 
another private meeting is scheduled for wednesday and bush 
will speak to businessmen in monterrey the countrys industrial 
capital 
a mexican bishop was quoted recently as saying it is like 
dealing with sharks to negotiate a free trade arrangement with 
the united states but a government official said bishops dont 
know much about economy 
the official speaking anonymously said the salinas government 
feels it can strike a satisfactory deal with the united states 
otto granados the presidential press spokesman said we 
think that within a year we can have the basis of the agreement 
salinas hopes mexican industrialists can produce more and better 
products to compete with an expected flood of us goods and also 
find markets in the united states years of hiding behind high 
tariff walls has hurt the competitive ability of some mexican 
companies 
since salinas took office in december 1988 mexico has lowered 
tariffs and joined the general agreement on trade and tariffs 
which his predecessors had sworn the country would never do us 
products from beer to cars now can be imported by those who can 
pay the lower duties 
ten years ago if a mexican president had suggested a free 
trade agreement with the united states people would have hanged 
him in the middle of the main plaza a high government official 
said on condition of anonymity 
i think mexican society has matured granados said there 
is less fear of the united states and we have a more pragmatic 
vision of our relationship with the united states 
there is a global tendency to form regional blocs europe is 
too concentrated on its own expanded markets asia is another bloc 
and we must look at our own regional possibilities 
mexico focuses its economic attention on the united states and 
canada rather than on central and south america 
granados said the presidents probably would discuss the drug 
issue only in passing if at all mexico feels cooperation on the 
drug problem is at least as good as it ever has been he said 
another question is the treatment of mexican nationals working 
in the united states a sensitive issue on both sides of the 
border migrant workers legal or illegal often are accused of 
involvement in drug trafficking and other criminal activities 
allegations of racism have marred relations in the past 
mexicans always have considered the united states a racist 
society recently newspapers in mexico have played up incidents 
along frontier with california where several mexican citizens have 
died trying to across illegally 
reports of californians lining up vehicles along the border and 
turning on the lights to help the border patrol are seen in mexico 
as expressions of racism 
the government wants any free trade agreement to make it easier 
for mexicans to enter the united states 
our claim is that the us economic reality demands mexican 
labor an official said 
even with more employment facilities in mexico the us 
salary levels will remain attractive to mexican workers what we 
want to do is make the flow of labor more rational 
mexican officials say northward migration is not permanent and 
that studies show nearly 90 percent of the workers return to 
mexico at least temporarily

about 2000 people mainly from rightwing groups 
rallied sunday in tribute to novelist yukio mishima who shocked 
japan with his gory ritual suicide 20 years ago at age 45 
mishima regarded as one of the leading japanese authors of this 
century had denounced the postwar constitution that renounces war 
and limits the emperors role to that of state symbol rather than a 
living god 
the rally participants pledged to follow his principles said 
toshio sasaki one of the organizers 
after the rally 1000 people including members of the japan 
student union and the rightwing neonationalist union marched to 
the army base where mishima disemboweled himself on nov 25 1970 
the demonstrators carried banners saying regain history and 
tradition and long live the emperor in a traditional 
gesture they laid chrysanthemums at the gates of the base 
police said there were no reports of violence 
before his suicide mishima and four young members of his small 
private militia took a general hostage and demanded that troops 
stationed at the base assemble on the parade ground 
in a speech from a balcony mishima urged the soldiers to rise 
up to regain glory for the japanese military and the emperor but 
he was heckled by the troops 
at that point mishima hurried indoors stripped to his 
loincloth and plunged a dagger into his abdomen in the traditional 
manner of suicide one of his followers then decapitated him with a 
sword 
at the time many feared that mishimas spectacular suicide 
could help revive the militarism that had driven japan into world 
war ii 
but his militaristic views have little popular support nowadays 
when prime minister toshiki kaifu recently proposed legislation 
that would allow japanese soldiers to be sent to the persian gulf 
in noncombat roles but opposition was so strong he had to drop 
the idea 
mishimas novels plays and short stories are known for 
reflecting the conflict between the west and traditional japanese 
values among his bestknown novels are confessions of a mask 
a partly autobiographical account of a boys selfawakening and 
the temple of the golden pavilion the story of a young monk 
who burns down a buddhist temple

much like the cold war itself the us effort 
to roll back communism under the reagan doctrine appears headed for 
oblivion 
in the wake of the new eastwest agreement on vastly reducing 
conventional arms in europe what passes for superpower tension 
these days results from the continuing ussoviet competition in 
remote third world conflicts 
during the 1960s and 1970s virtually the only guerrilla 
fighters were those operating in anticommunist countries often 
rightist military dictatorships 
that all changed under reagan and american conservatives 
cheered when reagan embraced freedom fighters opposing leftist 
rule around the world 
now after a run of four years much of the reagan doctrines 
vitality is gone 
in vote after vote congress has in effect told the bush 
administration that it doesnt see much sense in maintaining full 
funding of anticommunist rebel groups when the soviet bloc has 
ceased to exist 
the administration doesnt dispute the point but said continued 
aid to the rebel groups gives the leftist governments they oppose 
incentive to negotiate peace 
when reagan took office the only resistance movement receiving 
us help was the afghan mujahedeen by 1986 united states was 
assisting the nicaraguan contras cambodias noncommunist rebels 
and the insurgency fighting angolas leftist government 
but even that aid is in peril in a move that went almost 
unnoticed in the rush to adjournment congress passed an 
intelligence bill that dealt the doctrine another blow 
the bill would halt among other restrictions 60 million in 
us aid to angolas unita rebels if the leftist government agrees 
to hold free elections and the soviet union halts its own weapons 
shipments to the angolan armed forces 
it also suspends a 13 million covert aid program to 
anticommunist rebels in cambodia that will be replaced by a 
humanitarian aid program and it cuts back aid to the afghan 
resistance to 250 million 50 million less than the 
administration request the program would be cut off altogether if 
the soviets agree to stop sending military aid to the afghan 
government 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee said hes not surprised congress now balks at 
administration requests for aid to rightist rebel groups 
the soviets have cut back on funding of their clients around 
the world and we are responding accordingly he said the 
soviets are out of afghanistan the contras won in nicaragua and 
peace talks are in progress in angola 
rep henry hyde rill feels congress is too eager to shelve 
the reagan doctrine 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev may have won hhe nobel peace 
prize hyde said but he is still pouring in 650 million into 
angola and soviet advisers are still very active there 
hyde said he regrets the mood that exaggerates the resolution 
of the cold war 
peter rodman of the johns hopkins foreign policy institute 
agreed 
the former national security council aide said us assistance 
helped initiate peace negotiations in each of the countries where 
the united states was supporting a rebel group 
our strategy ought to be to complete the process rodman 
said dont leave them the rebel groups in the lurch the next 
phase is a political accommodation it makes no sense to penalize 
our side 
the nicaraguan contras were the first rebel group to be axed by 
the congress despite reagan administration predictions of 
impending doom resulting from the february 1988 vote against the 
contras the eventual outcome was a major plus for washington 
nicaraguas civil war ended and the voters used the ballot box 
to oust the sandinista government earlier this year achieving 
what weapons shipments to the contras were unable to do 
reagans decision to back the contras produced the most 
controversial moments of his presidency there were dozens of votes 
on contra aid over the years most of them cliffhangers the 
excesses of subordinates led to the irancontra arms and money 
scandal and bitter recriminations between the administration and 
congressional democrats 
ted galen carpenter director of foreign policy studies at the 
cato institute a washington research group said the reagan 
doctrine was misguided to begin with because some of the groups 
receiving us support were actually undemocratic having sprung 
from authoritarian traditions 
beyond that he said the reagan administration consistently 
oversold the dangers to the united states of leftist rule in 
nicaragua the reagan doctrine he said also involved washington 
in regions where no vital us interests were at stake 
but burton yale pines a senior vice president of the heritage 
foundation a conservative research group sees the reagan doctrine 
as a marvelous legacy because it proclaimed that the future 
belongs to democracy not to sovietimposed dictatorships

poles on their way to church and on 
morning strolls with dogs and children lined up at voting stations 
nationwide sunday to cast ballots in the countrys first popular 
election for president 
i was so excited i couldnt sleep last night said antonina 
kaminska a warsaw seamstress who voted for solidarity leader lech 
walesa 
walesa is a charismatic leader who gives all of poland hope 
she said on the dreary gray morning 
the elections pit walesa against his former ally prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki polish emigre stanislaw tyminski and three 
other candidates 
the campaign had become increasingly caustic and candidates 
engaged in westernstyle mudslinging walesa led in preelection 
polls 
stanislawa kloskowska a retired teacher from walesas home city 
of gdansk said she voted for the baltic ports most famous native 
son 
it was very easy to choose lech walesa she said he 
started everything here and we expect him to complete his job 
several people said they voted for tyminski a businessman who 
said he had made millions in canada and peru and pledged to build a 
democracy of money 
his wealth is attractive to many poles who are struggling with 
a radical economic reform program implemented by the mazowiecki 
government it has cut real income by 35 percent and put about 1 
million people out of work 
for a year too little attention was paid to economy said 
wladyslaw skarbek 41 a researcher at the polish academy of 
sciences in warsaw thats why i voted for tyminski as an 
outsider he will devote less time to politics and more to the 
economy 
while many voiced support for walesa others expressed concern 
that the nobel laureate would become a demagogue his opponents 
have drawn crowns and even hitlerlike moustaches on walesa 
campaign posters 
walesas impetuous nature and campaign pledges he promises to 
wield an ax to cut former communists out of polands industry 
and government have drawn sharp criticism from those who think 
the country should take a more cautious approach to reform 
i am afraid of walesa he is an egomaniac said juliusz 
baranowski director of a new convenience store in warsaw the 
world doesnt need another ayatollah 
baranowski said prime minister mazowiecki was not a born 
leader but that he voted for the former catholic journalist

they shunned the fried rice and their 
table manners left much to be desired but otherwise sundays feast 
for 500 monkeys was a success 
yongyudh kitwattananusom owner of a hotel in the historic city 
last week sent out elaborate written invitations to the hundreds of 
monkeys that inhabit an ancient temple in lopburi 
on sunday he set 50 tables complete with tablecloths and 
prepared a menu that included a vegetable salad cashew nuts eggs 
fried rice and mixed tropical fruits about 500 monkeys attended 
the feast 
yongyudh who threw a similar beast banquet last year hopes the 
event will help promote both his lopburi inn and the city once an 
outpost of the vast cambodian empire lopburi is 90 miles north of 
bangkok 
several thousand thais and foreigners gathered in lopburi 
sunday initially scaring away the banquet guests but enticed by 
papaya leaves the monkeys soon clambered down from their temple 
perches and tucked into the dishes 
they ignored the chairs positioned themselves atop tables and 
engaged in a lot of table hopping except for the fried rice which 
they inexplicably turned down the food was scooped up with gusto 
and washed down with soft drinks 
the monkeys pulled tabs from cans and poured soft drink into 
saucers 
although table etiquette was minimal the feast proceeded 
without fighting possibly because there was plenty of food to go 
around 
as part of this years event children aged 4 to 12 were invited 
to draw the monkeys a first prize of 1200 and two airline 
tickets to tokyos disneyland was offered 
many buddhist temples in thailand have become sanctuaries for 
wild animals because budhism forbids their killing

chess masters and archrivals garry kasparov 
and anatoly karpov began the second half of their chess world 
championship where they left off agreeing sunday to a draw 
the 13th game was adjourned saturday night after 41 moves in 
five hours of play with a draw inevitable according to the 
experts 
karpov who is trying to regain the world championship title 
from defender kasparov proposed the draw by telephone through the 
intermediary of dutch referee geurt gijssen officials said an 
option open to either player 
kasparov accepted 
karpov playing white would have opened sundays play with 
kxd3 the 42nd move sealed saturday night in an envelope was 
disclosed with the draw announcement sunday 
kasparov 27 and karpov 39 now each have 6 points they were 
tied at six points apiece after the first 12 games in new york from 
oct 8 to nov 7 10 of which were draws 
the first player to gain 12 points wins the championship and 
17 million of a 3 million purse in the event of a tie kasparov 
retains the title 
mondays 14th game is the second of the french phase of the 
championship 
saturdays match in the main auditorium of the palais des 
congres in this southcentral city was the first in the championship 
series in two weeks 
karpov moved the queens pawn to begin play again the players 
went through a series of moves known as the grunfeld defense which 
was used in game 9 
kasparov varied it a bit when he castled on the eighth move 
the pair traded queens before the 20th move and were reduced to 
eight pieces each by the 30th 
karpov repeatedly left his chair in the early part of the match 
kasparov stayed at the board hunched over in deep thought 
at the adjournment kasparov had just taken a pawn to finish 
with five pawns a rook and the king 
karpov had four pawns a rook and a king but was about to take a 
black pawn to even things up again 
karpov waited more than 10 minutes as the fivehour time limit 
drew close before sealing his 42nd move 
i thought it was reasonable exciting said international 
grandmaster mike valvo of perth amboy nj it was not a dull 
2530 move draw you would see in other matches 
karpov ran into a time problem as the time limit approached 
with only nine minutes to complete eight moves each player is 
alloted 2 hours for his first 40 moves 
but karpov moved eight times in his next seven minutes 
most of us who sat and watched thought that white had chances 
to win valvo said in time pressure karpov seemed to let 
whatever edge he had slip away 
kasparov gained the title in 1985 from karpov who had held it 
from 1975 
their dislike for each other is wellknown 
the two men differ in temperment looks politics and even 
playing style 
kasparov considers karpov a product of the soviet system 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals kasparov 
has said in an interview but in my case with karpov its a 
fight between two different mentalities in russia i identify him 
with the system ive been fighting

michael heseltine who precipitated prime minister 
margaret thatchers downfall said sunday he was confident of 
getting the necessary votes to win the leadership of his party and 
country this week 
but he admitted that some conservative party loyalists are 
deeply angry at him for his role in forcing out mrs thatcher who 
last week agreed to step down as prime minister 
heseltine 57 and treasury chief john major 47 a rightwinger 
who is reportedly supported by mrs thatcher appeared to be locked 
in a close contest in the race to succeed mrs thatcher with 
foreign secretary douglas hurd trailing 
london bookmakers ranked heseltine and major as even favorites 
to win in tuesdays ballot among the 372 conservative party 
legislators hurd was a long shot at around 101 
a series of opinion polls in sundays newspapers indicated the 
party would win elections with him or major as leader but lose 
under hurd 
but hurd 60 argued that he had the best chance of unifying the 
traumatized conservative party he said heseltine was handicapped 
by deep anger among some legislators and party activists over mrs 
thatchers departure 
there is a danger of a polarized result with the right wing 
clustering around him major and the left wing clustering 
around michael hesetline said hurd if that were to happen 
then i think there would be a danger of the quarrelling 
continuing 
heseltine in a series of radio and television interviews 
sunday argued that he has shown the same steely nerve that mrs 
thatcher displayed in 1975 when she ousted edward heath as party 
leader the tories were then in opposition 
mrs thatcher and i have that characteristic of independence 
some people call it guts said heseltine when you believe 
somthing is right you do it 
but he acknowledged there are people who are cross with me 
and i understand that 
mrs thatcher prime minister for 11 years withdrew thursday 
after she failed to get a big enough majority to stop heseltines 
challenge with her husband denis she spent the weekend for the 
last time at the prime ministers country residence outside london 
a clutch of wellwishers cheered the 65yearold prime minister 
as she left the local church after a morning service 
she has not publicly endorsed any candidate but londons sunday 
times quoting friends of mrs thatcher reported she will vote 
for major with hurd as second choice 
if none of the three candidates receives a simple majority 
tuesday a third ballot will be held thursday major and heseltine 
both say they believe they are rolling up the 187 votes needed 
they must be getting worried major said sunday after 
heseltines campaign manager legislator neil mcfarlane said 
claims of majority support by majors camp were bogus 
heseltine challenged mrs thatcher after her deputy prime 
minister sir geoffrey howe resigned and delivered a scathing 
attack on her combative stance with britains european community 
partners 
mrs thatcher was already in trouble over the economy and a 
unpopular new local government tax the poll tax which hesetline 
has pledged to review he has the advantage of being the only one 
in the cabinet not associated with the tax 
the polls in sundays newspapers suggested the conservative 
party which had trailed the labor party for the last 16 months of 
mrs thatchers leadership would be up to 13 points ahead under 
heseltine and about 46 points ahead under major in elections 
ive brought about a transformation in the conservative 
partys fortunes heseltine declared sunday

winston churchill grandson of 
britains great wartime prime minister paid a visit to the british 
troops in the saudi desert but jokingly admitted it wasnt his 
own finest hour 
when he introduced himself to a british tank crewman as winston 
churchill the conservative lawmaker told photographers the 
disbelieving soldier responded sarcastically im rommel 
gen erwin rommel the legendary desert fox led germanys 
afrika korp in world war ii 
the younger churchill in saudi arabia as part of a 14member 
parliamentary delegation rode in a challenger tank named for his 
grandfather and visited the former prime ministers old regiment 
the queens royal irish hussars

the khartoum campaign in sudan in the late 1800s 
at a news conference in a camouflage tent churchill said peace 
in the persian gulf depended on iraqi president saddam hussein he 
said the multinational force should not leave the gulf until 
saddams weapons of mass destruction are eliminated 
were not only talking about the withdrawal of iraqi forces 
from kuwait were talking about getting rid of iraqs budding 
nuclear and existing chemical and biological weapons and longrange 
delivery systems he said 
michael mates head of the delegation said he would tell 
parliament that that british morale is high and troops are ready to 
fight if need be 
we have been able to assure them with absolute certainty that 
there will be no change in policy because the entire government is 
behind us as is the opposition as are all parties he said

gulf region to 30000 troops that would make its contingent the 
secondlargest in the multinational force after that of the united 
states

nasa and the manufacturer share the blame 
for a flawed mirror that prevents the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope from focusing clearly a member of an investigatory panel 
said 
the nasa panels final report on the flawed telescope will 
criticize both the space agency and the perkinelmer corp said 
john mangus head of the optics branch of the national aeronautics 
and space administrations space technology division the report is 
to be released tuesday 
mangus said the flaws in the manufacture of the 94inch 
telescope in 1980 and 1981 can be partly traced to the same 
management climate that led to the fatal explosion of the space 
shuttle challenger in 1986 
in both cases he said engineers were discouraged from bringing 
potential problems to the attention of their superiors 
the culture has to be encouraged where you dont shoot the 
messenger he said in a hartford courant story published sunday 
people dont like bad news but what they like worse is not to 
be told about the problems i know it has occurred on many of 
nasas projects 
an investigation into the challenger explosion that killed seven 
crew members found that nasa ignored evidence of problems with 
orings sealing the joints of the shuttles solidfuel rocket 
boosters investigators faulted nasa for weak quality control and 
found that under intense schedule pressure engineers sometimes 
failed to report problems to managers 
the immediate cause of the hubble flaw was a technicians 
mistake but program managers approved the qualitycontrol program 
that allowed the mistake to escape detection the investigatory 
board concluded 
nasa certainly had the overall management responsibility 
mangus said they did not have the management system in place to 
penetrate far enough into the system otherwise this probably 
would not have happened 
board members would not release the report but mangus and other 
members told the newspaper that the report also says 
mirrortesting that was done relied too heavily on a single 
instrument which had been assembled improperly relatively simple 
sanity checks should have done to make sure the 
mirrorpolishing system was working properly 
there was too little contact between those working on the 
mirror and nasa project supervisors who could have understood the 
test results 
qualitycontrol inspectors lacked the expertise in optics to 
understand results of some tests that showed a flaw in the mirror 
the hubble telescope was launched with the space shuttle april 
24 and the focusing flaw was disclosed june 27 the flaw will be 
corrected during a 1993 space shuttle mission 
the mirror is flawed because the principal optical instrument 
used to test it and measure the progress of the polishing had been 
assembled incorrectly by technicians working at perkinelmers 
optical division which now is hughes danbury optical systems 
despite the flaw nasa scientists have been increasingly pleased 
with the telescopes observations which are better than can be 
made from instruments on earth because the atmosphere doesnt 
interfere 
nasa last week released new photographs of saturn showing 
details of an enormous atmospheric storm the hubble also has been 
able to photograph individual stars that exist in clusters 
enabling the stars to be studied separately for the first time

a woman suicide bomber detonated a 
handbag packed with explosives near an israeli patrol in southern 
lebanon sunday a prosyrian group said 12 israeli soldiers also 
died but israel said only two were injured 
the blast occurred hours after an israeli gunboat sank a dinghy 
off southern lebanon killing five guerrillas the israeli army 
said in jerusalem a palestinian group said four of the guerrillas 
were missing but that one managed to swim ashore it said the 
guerrillas had planned a raid in israel 
the escalating violence sharpened fears that southern lebanon is 
becoming a flashpoint as president elias hrawi tries to assert 
government authority and end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
the government has no troops in southern lebanon where israel 
controls a selfdesignated 440squaremile security zone but 
hrawis government has said it will seek to end israels occupation 
once it completes plans to get moslem and christian militias out of 
beirut 
communiques issued by the syrian social nationalist party 
identified the woman as fadwa hassan ghanem 
they said ms ghanem concealed the bag rigged with 55 pounds of 
tnt under a black chador she wore the chador is the traditional 
feminine dress of shiite moslem fundamentalists and covers the 
woman from head to toe 
beirut television stations later broadcast a 30second videotape 
in which ms ghanem said i am going to give my life for the 
cause of battling the zionist enemy out of our land 
the stations said the poorquality tape was provided by the 
group it showed ms ghanem dressed in camouflage fatigues talking 
into the camera surrounded by party posters and other 
paraphernalia 
i ask all of you to follow my example do not shy away from 
fighting the zionist usurper she said in a shaky voice 
she then stood up saluted with her right arm and shouted long 
live syria her partys motto 
ms ghanem detonated her bombladen handbag as an israeli patrol 
of 12 soldiers with two tanks was crossing the road between arnoun 
kfar tibnit and arnoun in the israeli security zone one communique 
said 
all soldiers of the patrol were killed and she was martyred 
it said 
but an israeli army spokesman said only two soldiers were on 
patrol checking a road near beaufort castle when a female 
terrorist ran at them strapped with an explosive charge she 
exploded herself wounding the two soldiers one in the neck and 
one in the feet 
beaufort a crusader castle that was a palestinian guerrilla 
stronghold in israels 1982 lebanon war is three miles north of 
the border 
dr mickey wiener deputy head of the rambam hospital in haifa 
where the wounded soldiers were evacuated by helicopter said they 
suffered ear injuries from the blast and superficial shrapnel 
wounds he described the soldiers condition as light to 
moderate 
the syrian social nationalist party is part of a coalition of 
lebanese leftist and prosyrian palestinian factions engaged in a 
guerrilla war aimed at dislodging israel from the border enclave 
the party advocates the creation of a greater syria by merging 
syria lebanon jordan preisrael palestine iraq kuwait and 
cyprus 
ms ghanems attack was the 23rd suicide bombing in the israeli 
security zone since 1985 when israel carved it out as a buffer 
against crossborder guerrilla attacks eight of the bombings were

neil bush served on the board of a silverado 
savings and loan affiliate that helped a denver homebuilder evade 
securities laws according to federal documents quoted in a 
newspaper sunday 
the presidents son already is awaiting an administrative law 
judges ruling on whether he was guilty of conflicts of interest 
while serving on the board of the failed denver savings and loan 
the failure of silverado in december 1988 is expected to cost 
taxpayers 1 billion 
the denver post reported sunday that it had obtained federal 
securities and exchange commission documents about bushs role on a 
management committee of silveradoelektra ventures ltd the land 
development arm of silverado 
silveradoelektra was a joint venture between silverado banking 
savings and loan and elektra brokerage co a denver real estate 
firm sampls spun off land companies after federal deregulation of 
the industry in the early 1980s allowed thrifts to invest directly 
in real estate 
bush has declined to comment on his role as a board member his 
attorney james nesland said bush served on the panelfrom late 
1985 or early 1986 until 1988 
bushs actions on the oversight committee may or may not become 
part of a 200 million negligence lawsuit filed by the federal 
deposit insurance corp against bush and other silverado directors 
and officers said fdic spokesman david barr 
were reserving that comment until it comes to trial barr 
said that doesnt mean its going to be an issue at the trial 
the documents show the committee approved silveradoelektras 
role as a phony buyer of some houston residential lots from mdc 
holdings inc a denver homebuilder the newspaper reported 
the sec documents indicated the silverado committee knew 
silveradoelektra was to be a straw buyer straw buyers typically 
are employed to disguise property ownership and do not use their 
own money 
during the course of its internal review representatives of 
the party silveradoelektra that purchased the residential lots 
from mdc stated that they would not have purchased the lots had 
they not felt assured of selling them to the third party the 
documents said 
the post said that previous testimony by thenmdc president 
david mandarich showed the homebuilder wanted to sell several 
hundred lots in the depressed houston market to bellamah homes of 
new mexico mdc also wanted to buy lots near castle rock from a 
bellamah homes subsidiary 
because mdc is a publicly traded company federal securities 
laws prevent it from exchanging properties with bellamah and then 
recording a profit on the sale of the houston lots 
the sec documents show mdc asked silveradoelektra to buy the 
houston lots for 37 million the same day mdc contracted to buy 
the castle rock land from bellamah homes and three days later 
silveradoelektra sold the houston lots to bellamah homes the 
documents showed 
the sec disciplined mdc in september 1989 for its handling of 
eight real estate transactions between 1985 and 1987 including 
employing silveradoelektra as a straw buyer and booking 
profits on the houston sale mdc neither admitted nor denied guilt 
to the sec but agreed to make changes in some of its accounting 
practices

the chicken kings christmas display is 
going up at the state capitol this year and about 140 prison 
inmates are playing lighting elves 
the inmates are working in shifts to put up 15 million lights 
on the state capitol grounds for al copelands display copeland is 
the founder of popees fried chicken amp biscuits chain and last year 
bought churchs fried chicken 
for the past few years copeland has put up the display at his 
headquarters in suburban new orleans before that copelands 
lights blazed around his home in the new orleans suburb of 
metairie but after complaints from neighbors sparked a court case 
the state supreme court said in 1985 that the display was too big 
and attracted too many gawkers to keep at home 
it normally takes me about 60 days to do this and i use about 
60 people but theyre giving me 16 days to do it said 
robert theriot who has overseen installation of the display for 
the past halfdozen years 
copeland went looking for a larger site this year and state 
agriculture commissioner bob odom suggested that copeland light up 
the trees at the capitol to honor us soldiers in saudi arabia 
the inmates climbed ladders and scaffolds to deck the capitols 
old oaks junipers magnolias azaleas and other trees and shrubs 
with lights 
its a real challenge said megan becker copelands 
designer and decorator its different but the trees speak for 
themselves each is a work of art you just string lights around 
them 
the switch is to be thrown thursday 
it will be finished it will said theriot

a newspaper on sunday urged the kremlin to move 
slowly on the new union treaty saying that only the soviet unions 
four central asian republics appeared willing to support it now 
the treaty which would redefine the central governments 
relationship with the 15 republics was proposed by president 
mikhail s gorbachev on saturday to hold the nation together as the 
union of sovereign soviet republics it would give the 
republics control over virtually all affairs except defense 
but the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said that if the 
central government presses for an early signing of the document it 
will lose the republics of latvia lithuania estonia and georgia 
the newspaper also said it was unclear whether russia the 
ukraine byelorussia and moldavia would support it 
boris n yeltsin president of the russian republic said last 
week russia would not sign the treaty unless its real 
sovereignty could be assured and ownership issues over its 
bountiful natural resources are resolved 
the independent postfactum news agency on sunday quoted mikhail 
goryn a member of the ukraines nationalist movement rukh as 
urging that committees be formed at every plant in the republic to 
denounce the treaty 
in addition to those republics mentioned by komsomolskaya 
pravda armenia has said it would not sign the participation of 
others is in doubt because of drives for sovereignty or 
independence in all republics except kirgizia 
komsomolskaya pravda said that the central asian republics 
kirgizia tadzhikistan uzbekistan and turkmenia seem to be the 
sole supporters 
central asia is the soviet unions poorest and most politically 
conservative region 
many republics have been bypassing the kremlin and signing 
separate agreements with each other governing trade cultural and 
political ties 
komsomolskaya pravda took note of these bilateral treaties 
saying they further complicate the picture and shift the signing 
of a new union treaty to a still longer perspective 
in what could be regarded as the most overly optimistic 
assessment of the documents chances the labor newspaper trud 
quoted politburo member and communist party ideology chief 
alexander s dzasokhov as saying the union treaty is supported by 
at least 11 to 12 republics 
yet even with that upbeat conclusion dzasokhov told the 
newspaper i think that we should use our patience and wait i 
see no other way out he also said that under the treaty the 
republics would be sovereign in the broadest sense of the word 
the blueprint was sent to the legislatures of the union and the 
15 republics for approval 
not only the baltic states but also many soviet republics 
will not sign this treaty lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis said saturday in a televised speech to his republic 
komsomolskaya pravda considered a radical newspaper generally 
praised the draft treaty as a balanced and sensible document that 
considers the nations political situation the central government 
does not set its requirements too high so as not to scare away the 
tentative members of the new union 
the newspaper noted that the draft contained potential 
obstacles which are bound to raise questions and evoke heated 
debate 
one provision says the powers of the union shall not be 
changed unless all the republics agree komsomolskaya pravda 
identified that section as a problem in an apparent 
acknowledgement of the difficulty of getting a consensus among the 
diverse regions in the nation of 285 million people 
another stumbling block is a part that says the union shall only 
delegate some of its powers to one or several republics if agreed 
upon by the rest of the republics the newspaper said 
the treaty says the union would be voluntary but does not 
identify who in each republic voters or legislators would 
decide whether to join 
each republic as a sovereign state has full state powers 
over its territory treaty participants regard the soviet union as 
a sovereign federative state formed as a result of the republics 
voluntary union the draft says

egypt and israel signed a peace treaty in 
1979 but even if the two governments are no longer officially 
enemies the people of the neighboring nations are far from 
friends 
that was underscored sunday when a lone gunman slipped across 
the egyptian border sunday and fired an automatic rifle at a bus 
and three military vehicles killing four israelis and wounding 27 
the egyptian interior ministry said it had arrested a border 
policeman suspected as the gunman 
egypt officially condemned the attack foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid called it very regrettable and said he hoped it 
would not affect relations between the two countries 
but analysts say incidents like this one reflect popular anger 
in egypt over the palestinian conflict heightened by a sense that 
the conflict is being overshadowed by the persian gulf crisis 
there is a growing frustration with the way the israelis are 
treating palestinians in the occupied territories said tahseen 
bashir a former spokesman for late president anwar sadat and a 
professor at the foreign ministrys school for diplomats 
bashir echoed an oftenstated arab opinion that west is unfair 
in not viewing israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the way it views iraqs occupation of kuwait he also said many 
egyptians view israel as being at least partly responsible for such 
attacks 
individual incidents will occur and are symptoms of the wrong 
policy israel is pursuing bashir said 
sundays attack took place on a road running along the 
israeliegyptian border about 15 miles northwest of the israeli red 
sea resort of eilat the israeli army said 
it was the third attack against israel from arab territory in 
two days at least four palestinian guerrillas were killed and two 
israeli soldiers injured in incidents in israels selfdeclared 
security zone in southern lebanon and off the mediterranean coast 
in amman jordan an extremist islamic group islamic holy 
warjerusalem claimed responsibility for the eilat attack the 
claim could not be verified 
the organization was founded in the israelioccupied west bank 
in 1980 and has hundreds of followers throughout the arab world it 
is financed by libya and iran 
islamic holy warjeruslam identified the perpetrator as the 
group of the martyred hero suliman khater khater was an egyptian 
border police officer who went berserk on oct 5 1985 and killed 
seven israelis in the sinai desert 
he was sentenced to prison at hard labor and four months after 
the shooting the government announced he had hanged himself in a 
cairo prison hospital moslem fundamentalists students and 
opposition parties hailed him as a hero and martyr 
the eilat attack was the latest in a string of recent attacks on 
israeli targets involving egyptian assailants or using egypt as a 
staging ground 
on feb 4 gunmen ambushed a tour bus killing nine vacationers 
on the road between cairo and the suez canal city of ismailiya 
interior minister abdelhalim moussa has hinted the gunmen who 
were arrested are palestinians 
last december israeli troops killed five heavily armed arabs 
who infiltrated from egypt into israels negev desert to allegedly 
carry out an attack there has been no more information on the 
assailants their nationalities or allegiance 
attacks since 1984 also included a number of shootings claimed 
by an egyptian terrorist organization egypts revolution 
allegedly financed by a son of egypts first president gamal 
abdelnasser 
the group currently under trial for the attacks killed two 
israeli diplomats and wounded six israelis and attempted to shoot 
at american diplomats it is regarded as being an arab nationalist 
organization with no ties to molsem fundamentalists 
some of the defendents said in court they acted in protest of 
the normalization of relations between egypt and israel

premier andrei lukanov under growing 
pressure to step down in the face of political turmoil and economic 
trouble warned sunday that a threatened strike would only make 
things worse 
the opposition trade union federation podkrepa said it would go 
ahead with a general strike on monday if lukanov does not resign by 
then 
in a televised statement sunday evening lukanov called the 
planned strike an extreme act and said it could have serious 
consequences 
he urged bulgarians not to support the adventurers who in 
their greed for power are prepared to push bulgaria onto the fatal 
path of civic conflict 
the main trade union confederation said sunday it would not back 
the strike 
the opposition alliance union of democratic forces said it 
would hold a rally tuesday in support of the strike a rally 
planned for sunday did not take place 
the continuingeconomic decline and shortages of basic foods and 
consumer goods have led to growing demands for lukanovs 
resignation there were daily demonstrations against the government 
over the past week 
lukanov and his government of former communists narrowly 
survived a noconfidence vote in parliament on friday it capped 
months of wrangling between the governing socialists and the 
opposition over how to revive the economy and end the political 
stalemate 
the socialist party the successor to the former communist 
party won june elections 
on sunday small groups of protesters marched through sofia and 
some tried to block streets as antigovernment demonstrators had 
done for an hour saturday police patrolled some in riot gear 
god wont fill the shops but the strike will certainly empty 
them lukanov warned many staples are already rationed or not 
available and an energy crisis has led to periodic power cuts 
lukanov said the government had taken all legal measures to 
ensure that transport communications medical services and 
deliveries of basic goods would not be interrupted 
in a separate television appearance the leader of the podkrepa 
trade union konstantin trenchev rejected government claims that 
the strike would be illegal because of its political nature 
trenchev said a government must resign if it cannot secure a 
minimum standard of living for its population 
earlier opposition and government leaders said they should talk 
about forming a coalition lukanov appeared to concur saying it 
was necessary to find a formula for the cooperation between the 
political forces in the next week 
ivailo trifonov of the presidents office said on state radio 
that neither of the two main political forces could govern alone 
now 
it is necessary that the socialist party and the union of 
democratic forces sit at the negotiating table as quickly as 
possible to seek a way out of the crisis he said 
the socialists hold 210 seats in parliament the opposition 
union of democratic forces has 144 seats

baghdad on sunday pressed for the release of some of the hundreds 
of americans held in iraq 
the visit came as more than 100 freed german captives arrived 
home after nearly four months of captivity and iraqi officials said 
about 70 italians were to be released tuesday 
officials said ali former heavyweight champion of the world 
was to be received sunday by president saddam hussein in his 
heavily guarded presidential palace on the banks of the tigris 
river 
however the session was postponed and no new date was 
announced there was no explanation of why the meeting was put off 
an earlier report had said the two met

detained in iraq and another 600 americans are in kuwait either 
under detention or in hiding 
one of alis associates arthur morrison said ali was here on 
a goodwill mission and hoped to secure the release of some of the 
americans

from parkinsons disease and cannot talk morrison based his 
comment on hand signals by ali 
the former champion a convert to islam and conscientious 
objector during the vietnam war has visited moslem holy sites in

iraq 
prominent figures from more than a dozen countries with

captives home with them 
the 104 freed germans and a briton arrived in frankfurt sunday 
many with tears streaming down their faces as they were reunited 
with families and friends rudolf seiters chancellor helmut kohls

solution to the gulf crisis

leave iraq this month former chacellor willy brandt brought 120

and europeans stranded or held in iraq and kuwait between christmas

voter turnout appeared light sunday 
in the countrys first multiparty parliamentary election which 
opposition leaders claim was marred by intimidation and fraud by 
the party that ruled unchallenged for 30 years 
several people remained hospitalized after a clash saturday 
between supporters of president felix houphouetboignys 
conservative democratic party and its hhief rival the leftleaning 
popular front 
about 44 million people registered to choose 175 legislators 
from among the 490 candidates representing 19 parties early 
results were expected monday 
the democrats are assured of 40 seats that are unchallenged 
they are expected to easily win a majority reinforcing 
houphouetboignys huge victory last month in this west african 
nations first contested presidential race 
his sole challenger popular front leader laurent gbagbo 
accused the ruling party of rigging that election in which the 
85yearold houphouetboigny received 8167 percent of votes 
in the presidential ballot gbagbos supporters smashed ballot 
boxes they charged were stuffed in advance with votes for 
houphouetboigny the government said the opposition disrupted 
voting because they knew they would not win 
early sunday about 200 armed soldiers surrounded gbagbos 
constituency of ouragahio 170 miles northwest of abidjan 
a spokesman for the opposition leader said the local government 
there had announced people could vote without producing identity or 
voter registration cards 
there were few long lines at the polls sunday polling places 
appeared more crowded in the presidential elections which had a 63 
percent turnout 
at a voting station in abidjans affluent suburb of cocody some 
people said they were confused by the number of candidates before 
1980 they could vote only yes or no to a single candidate 
in 1980 and 1985 they could choose between two candidates 
these elections are pointless said one voter on condition 
of anonymity why do we need them when we have a perfectly 
capable president 
the opposition was handicapped by the large funds the ruling 
party compiled from compulsory contributions from civil servants 
salaries also the government allowed voting by africans from 
other countries working in ivory coast the foreigners comprise at 
least a third of the 112 million population and almost all support 
the ruling party 
in the central town of bouake popular front officials said 
their representatives were refused entry into polling stations to 
monitor voting all parties fielding candidates are supposed to be 
able to watch the voting 
the expected democratic party victory would appear to ensure 
houphouetboigny can choose a successor believed to be assembly 
speaker henri konan bedie 
presidential aides have said houphouetboigny wanted to resign 
in a few months under legislation pushed through the assembly this 
month he would be succeeded by the speaker until the next 
scheduled elections in 1995 previously if the president died or 
retired the speaker could govern temporarily while he organized a 
special presidential election 
the first electionrelated violence was reported saturday in 
abidjans suburb of yopougon 
the suburbs deputy mayor mustapha doukoure a candidate in the 
election said popular front supporters threw stones and beat 
ruling party members with sticks to stop them holding a peaceful 
march he said 37 of his supporters were injured 
the opposition party said however the clash occurred after men 
in three cars drove into a crowd of its followers leaving a 
meeting injuring several in the fighting that followed 17 people 
were hurt and 10 of those were being treated in the hospital a 
party spokesman said 
soldiers patrolled sunday in yopougon the site of the first 
prodemocracy protests in ivory coast in february weeks of strikes 
and violent riots followed forcing houphouetboigny to legalize 
the political opposition 
the demonstrations were precipitated by an economic crisis 
caused by corruption overspending and slumping cocoa and coffee 
prices on world markets

sections of a closed interstate highway bridge 
across lake washington sank sunday after a round of stormy weather 
and engineers said the rest could collapse at any time 
about onethird of the 1milelong floating bridge across the 
lake sank another piece sank about five hours later and other 
sections appeared to be breaking loose witnesses said no injuries 
were reported 
the fourlane bridge which parallels the new interstate 90 
bridge that opened lasg rebuilt to serve as 
eastbound lanes for the roadway across the lake 
state transportation engineers and police closed tht year was beine 
new 
sevenlane bridge which carries an average of about 110000 
vehicles a day out of concern loose pieces of the old bridge could 
damage it 
the old bridge floats on the water like a ship anchored in 
place and has flotation chambers that can be pumped out dedicated 
in 1940 it was the worlds first concrete pontoon floating bridge 
said william southern jr a spokesman for the washington 
department of transportation 
the new bridges anchoring cables look at the highly unpopular percapita 
community charge or poll 
tax 
however kern noted that whoever the winner is britains 
tense relationship with europe wont become a great love affair 
hodgson said all the contenders have got immaculate 
thatcherite credentials they are all fully committed to 
privatization theyre all fully committed to lowering tax rates as 
quickly as possible and as is prudent hodgson said 
you may say that thatcher may have gone but the fundamental 
commitment of the conservative party to widen individual choice by 
shrinking government remains theirs hodgson said

a swiss official said sunday that his government 
and the united states have ended a diplomatic spat over scuffles 
and shouting matches between president bushs entourage and geneva 
police 
however the white house said it had referred the matter to the 
state department which is expected to lodge a protest 
in his comments swiss foreign minister rene felber said the 
white house acknowledged sharing the blame for the incidents which 
were caused by misunderstandings over security procedures the 
affair is closed felber said in an interview 
on saturday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
united states planned to file a diplomatic protest over the 
incidents during bushs threehour geneva stopover friday to meet 
syrian president hafez assad 
felber claimed the white house backtracked in a subsequent phone 
call to switzerlands ambassador in washington edouard brunner he 
said that the white house simply thanked the swiss ambassador in 
washington for shortnotice work in organizing the bushassad 
meeting 
the swiss minister said the white house acknowledged it failed 
to tell geneva security officers that some reporters and 
photographers traveling with the president should be allowed under 
a wing of air force one to watch bush come and go as is customary 
during the scuffle press people were pushed and shoved by 
security forces fitzwater said us chief of protocol joseph reed 
was poked in the stomach with a machine gun 
no one was injured however 
roman popadiuk deputy white house press secretary said sunday 
the matter now rests with state department officials who were to 
file the protest its out of our hands popadiuk said 
fitzwater had called it the most brutal and vicious treatment 
by a security force in the last 10 years he said white house 
chief of staff john sununu was verbally abused by the head of 
geneva security when he protested over the incidents

communists who were swept from 
federal power a year ago rebounded in slovakia municipal elections 
sunday to win more mayoral races than any other party 
we hope these elections will allow us to show that we can also 
be around in a democratic and pluralistic system slovak 
communist party leader peter weiss said 
however president vaclav havels civic forum party took nearly 
30 percent of the council races in the northern czech republic 
where communists placed third 
in slovakia communist candidates won 660 mayors seats or 232 
percent of the 2840 contests chief statistician pavel husak of 
the slovak electoral commission said 
the slovak national party which supports a separate slovak 
state won 43 seats or 15 percent of all the races the vote had 
been considered a test of separatist sentiment in the republic 
the strong communist showing appeared due in part to the 
emphasis on the candidates personalities rather than their party 
affiliations 
the christian democrats were second with 541 mayoral wins or 
1904 percent and public against violence with 476 victories or 
167 percent said husak 
other parties won the rest of the seats 
the state ctk news agency said the christian democrats won 274 
percent of the council seats in slovakia public against violence 
was second with 204 percent and the communists third with 136 
percent 
public against violence won the most seats in slovakia in june 
regional and federal elections the party joined civic forum to 
help oust communists last year 
but the its popularity has waned in recent months it is blamed 
by many slovaks for increasing economic hardships in the move to a 
marketoriented system 
in the czech republic civic forum won 299 percent of 70000 
council races czech mayors are to be chosen by the councils 
independents were a surprising second with 252 percent 
according to initial results announced by the czech electoral 
commission the communists had 15 percent and the peoples party 
of christian democrats were fourth at 149 percent 
other parties gained the balance of the spots 
the official tallies are expected later this week

the 10 families of this mudandmarsh 
hamlet have no doubt lech walesa should be president after all 
hes one of them 
we know that from this man we can expect some results said 
stefan walesa the solidarity chiefs cousin and childhood 
playmate 
maybe they say their leszek will use his presidential 
power to get the road to his birthplace paved 
the rest of my family my mother my father my three brothers 
all just now got on the tractor and went to vote for him said 
grzegorz kosziowny whose parents remember the schoolboy walesa 
running across the fields 
nothing marks the beginning or end of popowo a twohour drive 
northwest of warsaw along the vistula river there is no shop no 
school no church the town is not on the road map and no sign 
points the way down a rutted halfflooded dirt road to the 
scattered farmsteads 
walesa grew up in a metalroof concreteblock home in a potato 
field there was no electricity or water in the threeroom house 
when he was born there sept 23 1943 
walesa remembers the fouracre tract his father inherited from 
the muchdivided family property as utterly deprived of 
anything approaching nostalgia 
our neighbors had avoided it deeming it too dreadful to live 
on he recalled in his 1987 autobiography a way of hope 
walesas father died in 1945 his health ruined by forced labor 
under the german occupiers his mother married her brotherinlaw a 
year later and the impoverished family struggled in the devastated 
postwar countryside sometimes without even bread to eat 
it was not until 1967 that the 24yearold walesa put on his 
coat took some money and pushed by a broken love affair and a 
sense of wasted time got on a train in nearby dobrzyn it went to 
gdansk where he took a job at the lenin shipyard 
increasingly troubled by the workers conditions and 
totalitarian communist rule especially after the bloody 
repression of strikes in 1970 walesa lost one job after another 
to his activism 
he was unemployed and outside the strikebound shipyard when he 
made his famous leap over the gate to lead solidaritys founding in 
1980 
held in custody after martial law in december 1981 and awarded 
the nobel peace prize in 1983 walesa maneuvered the solidarity 
movement through years of repression it took control of the 
government in 1989 
on sunday three generations of cousin stefan walesas family 
went to church and then voted for their leszek for president 
it is a wonderful feeling said stefan walesa a workworn 
53yearold farmer 
he deserves to be president there is no other pole who risked 
his life so much to defeat the communist system 
in a living room decorated like that of many poles with a 
painting of polishborn pope john paul ii and a small photo of the 
solidarity leader walesa chuckles at the memory of the willful 
young lech born next door 
when he was young he wanted to do everything he was involved 
in everything he said 
he became a national hero from such a small house stefan 
walesa said 
lech walesa returns to popowo from time to time most recently 
on nov 1 for all saints day when poles make pilgrimages to the 
graves of their relatives 
some say walesa lacks the refinement to be president but that 
is what appeals to many of his supporters 
he is a real pole from a poor family like us farmers said 
one middleage woman emerging from the unheated social hall in 
neighboring turzy wilcza that served as the polling station for 
popowo 
the fact that he was born here is one of many reasons we voted 
for him

lech walesa who united poles in their 
struggle against communism won the initial round in polands first 
popular presidential election sunday but appeared headed for a 
runoff according to state tv exit polls 
in a surprising development prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
was in a close race against stanislaw tyminski for the no 2 spot 
tyminski a political unknown until recently is a businessman who 
returned to his homeland only this fall after 21 years in canada 
and peru 
the secondplace finisher will enter a dec 9 runoff if the 
winner fails to gain an outright majority in the first round 
walesa the head of solidarity had 41 percent of the vote a 
2to1 lead over mazowiecki and tyminski according to the polls 
the polls indicated mazowiecki and tyminski each had 205 percent 
of the vote far ahead of the remaining three candidates 
but early official returns from 270 polling stations or about 1 
percent of the vote nationwide said walesa led with 391 percent 
followed by tyminski with 234 percent and mazowiecki at 20 
percent 
it was a stunning setback for mazowiecki a former walesa ally 
who instituted unpopular economic austerity measures after taking 
command of polands first postwar noncommunist government 
no matter what the election results are we created a basis 
for a broader democratic movement in poland mazowiecki told 
supporters at a students club in warsaw we will continue the 
struggle for a democracy as we want it 
he added later on television that he was waiting for real 
results and not just some estimates 
pollsters questioned every 20th voter at 404 polling places 
around the country or up to 15000 people the results were issued 
on nationwide tv minutes after the polls closed at 8 pm 2 pm 
est 
the poll indicated that farmers who represent 40 percent of 
polish society deserted mazowiecki en masse 
only 4 percent of the farm vote went to the prime minister 
according to the poll farmers have been angry at the abolition of 
guaranteed prices for their produce under the governments shock 
economic reform plan 
mazowiecki also did poorly among workers but led among 
intellectuals according to the poll 
tyminski nearly tied walesa in the silesian mining district the 
poll said coal miners there are threatened with layoffs and have 
been staging a series of warning strikes 
a member of mazowieckis campaign parliament deputy jan 
litynski said the early exit poll results were a bit exaggerated 
tadeusz mazowiecki will undoubtedly reach the second round 
stanislaw tyminski is the epitome of the fairy tale goldfish 
who promises to fulfill our wishes said wladyslaw frasyniuk 
cofounder of the promazowiecki political party citizens movement 
for democratic action 
promazowiecki newspaper editor ernest skalski said if tyminski 
gets to the runoff walesa would win handily but the very fact 
that he got to the second round would be a shameful episode in our 
political history he said 
other supporters of mazowiecki the east blocs first 
noncommunist head of government seemed convinced that walesa will 
win 
unfortunately what we will see with walesa as president is 
hyperinflation and chaos said marek dabrowski a former deputy 
finance minister who left the government to join mazowieckis bid 
walesa declined any immediate public statement jacek merkel 
manager of walesas campaign said walesa was still awaiting final 
results he scheduled a news conference for monday 
however lech kaczynski the deputy solidarity chairman and a 
top walesa strategist said im rather disappointed because we 
hoped for at least 50 percent he added now we have to deal 
with two phenomena an absolute defeat of the government camp and 
this dangerous phenomenon called tyminski 
tyminski who promised to quickly cure polands economic 
problems said on television late sunday i expected such a 
result i am very happy 
he accused state television of mounting a campaign against him 
and said he would challenge walesa to a debate in the second 
round i will be supported by all those forces that have been 
supporting me plus those which i hope will have a better 
chance to believe i am an honest man he added 
tyminski conducted an americanstandard campaign breaking 
every rule political commentator ryszard legutko said on state 
television 
during the campaign the state prosecutor opened a slander 
investigation against tyminski who had charged that mazowiecki had 
committed treason against the nation with his economic policies 
mazowieckis government is struggling to create a market economy 
and strip away the vestiges of 45 years of communism 
the new president will take over from president wojciech 
jaruzelski the communist general who ordered martial law to crush 
solidarity and imprisoned walesa and mazowiecki in december 1981 
he also is expected to receive the symbols of authority from the 
stillexisting world war ii government in exile in london which 
never recognized the sovietbacked state 
jaruzelski interviewed on television said he did not see the 
early poll results as a great surprise 
mazowiecki was a longtime adviser to walesa and the solidarity 
leader had tapped him to become head of the government in 1989 
but they had a bitter fallingout and the voting climaxed an 
often acrimonious twomonth campaign that split the solidarity 
movement into factions that supported the candidates mazowiecki 
was backed by intellectuals who walesas populist campaign harshly 
criticized 
there was harsh language on both sides with walesa calling 
mazowiecki too slow and mazowiecki accusing walesa of 
destabilizing the country 
the campaign also was tainted by the antisemitism of a fraction 
of the electorate with oftrepeated rumors that the devoutly roman 
catholic mazowiecki was jewish or that jews dominated his 
government 
walesa condemned antisemitism resurgent in a poland with 
virtually no jews and said he would not permit it as president 
but he was accused of not doing enough to discourage such 
attitudes and even of encouraging them with campaign statements 
that he was a pure pole 
the election ultimately became a test of political direction 
the first in eastern europe to focus not on defeating communism but 
choosing between visions for the postcommunist future 
walesa 47 is the charismatic leader of solidarity the first 
independent labor federation in the soviet bloc which led the 
anticommunist rebellion he contends even more reforms are needed 
more quickly or a social explosion is coming 
mazowiecki 63 launched the regions most dramatic economic 
overhaul on jan 1 and says poland needs his team to stay and 
finish the job through consistent gradual change he has accused 
walesa of making promises he cannot keep and some of his backers 
say walesa would be a demagogue 
it was the first time that poles voted for a president by 
popular election in the past both under communist rule and before 
world war ii presidents were elected by the parliament 
retired office worker genewefa pawlak a walesa backer in 
gdansk said we trust him because he fought for 10 years and he 
never let us down 
the new president will serve a fiveyear term as head of state 
and commander in chief of the military with powers to nominate the 
prime minister dissolve parliament and declare a state of 
emergency under strictly defined circumstances 
the other candidates were roman bartoszcze of the polish 
peasants party former communist wlodzimierz cimoszewicz endorsed 
by the social democracy party and leszek moczulski head of the 
patrioticnationalist confederation for an independent poland

landed here for two weeks conquering broadway 
connick who is 23 opened an evening with harry connick jr 
and his orchestra at the luntfontanne theater friday night the 
same night swinging out with harry a dallas show on the tour 
connick started in april was on tv hes also known for putting 
together the when harry met sally soundtrack and hes currently 
making his movie acting debut in memphis belle as a tailgunner 
who sings 
the exuberant show should gladden the hearts of jazz fans as a 
singer connick is the mel torme of his generation he can croon 
but he isnt a pop singer hes a jazz singer once he sings scat 
as a pianist he has a heavy percussive attack he plays in a lot 
of styles even stride and boogie woogie but he doesnt touch 
jazzrock 
the 16piece band he carries with him has a solid big band 
sound it isnt as hardcharging as woody hermans herds on 
purpose since its leader sings a lot and wants to be heard but it 
swings and it has some classy exciting soloists connick always 
announces them in the best tradition 
the amazing thing is that connick gets the big band feeling and 
music so right and makes it sound so contemporary never a careful 
reconstruction of the past 
for a new orleans traditional number he has musicians playing 
banjo and sousaphone does some lusty second line dancing 
like the people right behind the band in parades and takes over 
the drums so drummer shannon powell can dance 
connick does a lot of things he sings then does a soft shoe in 
all i need is the girl it wont make one forget the number in 
gypsy two blocks away but its charming he writes music he 
sings forever for now with subtle clever lyrics by ramsey 
mclean his encore was buried in blue which he composed about 
his mother who died when he was 13 he has that on a record album 
but probably shouldnt use it as an encore 
his manner is engaging bordering on the corny sometimes but 
not quite getting there the audience sees through the ah 
shucks to the selfassurance and stays in the palm of his hand 
after intermission a 22piece orchestra mainly strings is 
atop the steps where the band had been after a couple of numbers 
the band appears in one long line in the orchestra pit 
marilyn lowey is innovative with lighting sometimes the 
audience sees connick in silhouette conducting the show starts 
with him at the piano then lights reveal the rest of the 
musicians joe layton directed marc shaiman conducts in act 2 
alexander julian has connick dress casually in a white 
opennecked shirt tan slacks and navy blazer 
connicks father attended opening night took a bow and had 
danny boy dedicated to him

us officials said late sunday they want the united nations to 
authorize using force against iraq if it does not leave kuwait by 
jan 1 and baghdads government threatened to rain missiles on 
saudi arabia if us troops attack 
iraq also said it was mobilizing tens of thousands of farmers 
for military service even though it is struggling to increase food 
production to offset the effects of un sanctions imposed after 
the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iraqi authorities meanwhile were taking steps to make sure any 
shortages caused by the sanctions are felt in kuwait which iraq 
calls its 19th province the official iraqi news agency said food 
rationing would begin soon in the conquered emirate 
us officials seeking a un resolution authorizing military 
force against iraq said they want a jan 1 deadline an 
administration official pointed out that secretary of state james 
a baker iii has been talking about an endofyear deadline during 
his recent globetrotting campaign to win their support for a un 
resolution authorizing force 
weve just kind of formalized that in the draft resolution 
given to other permanent members of the un security council said 
the official on condition of anonymity 
also sunday kuwaits governmentinexile citing reports from 
escapees said kuwaiti resistance fighters had recently wounded the 
iraqiappointed governor of kuwait the report could not be 
independently confirmed but iraq did announce the appointment of a 
new governor earlier this month without saying why the former one 
was being replaced 
iraq continued its piecemeal release of foreign hostages but no 
americans were among those freed sunday more than 100 german 
hostages arrived home after nearly four months of captivity and 10 
greeks returned to athens iraqi officials also said 70 italians 
would be freed tuesday 
dozens of former government leaders and other dignitaries have 
traveled to baghdad to try to win the release of captive 
foreigners even though such private trips are discouraged by the 
us government 
the latest such visitor was boxing legend muhammad ali who had 
planned to meet with saddam hussein on sunday at the presidential 
palace the session was postponed and no new date for the meeting 
was announced an earlier erroneous report had said the two met 
an ali associate arthur morrison said the former world 
heavyweight champion was on a goodwill mission and hoped to 
free some americans morrison spoke to reporters on behalf of ali 
who is suffering from parkinsons disease and cannot speak 
us officials meanwhile were laying the groundwork for what 
they hope will be a un vote by thursday on the resolution to 
authorize use of force against iraq the united states is seeking a 
vote this week because its onemonth presidency of the 15member 
security council ends friday taking over is the red sea state of 
yemen which has supported iraq in the past 
but bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft said 
sunday that american forces could move against iraq without un 
approval bush made a similar statement friday 
secretary of state james a baker iii spent last week in an 
intensive round of lobbying for the measure malaysias foreign 
minister said after meeting with baker on saturday that he believed 
the meeting would take place thursday the los angeles times also 
said in sunday editions the vote was expected then 
canadian external affairs minister joe clark said sunday his 
country supports the resolution and called it a final attempt 
for a peaceful settlement to the gulf crisis canada is a 
nonpermanent member of the council 
iraq meanwhile was underscoring its determination to hang onto 
the emirate even in the face of a military strike it said if the 
usled military force tried to dislodge it from kuwait saudi 
arabia and other gulf states would be hit by missile attacks 
the springboards for any aggression targeting iraq will 
without exception become a theater of operation if the us 
administration and its allies insist on the military option the 
armys alqadissiyah daily newspaper declared 
the iraqi threat was seen by some as an effort to drive a wedge 
between the united states and saudi arabia some saudi officials 
are believed to oppose an offensive from their soil 
the usled force was originally deployed with the stated aim 
of defending saudi arabia against any new iraqi aggression but 
president bush has said a buildup now underway would give the force 
offensive capability 
about 26 nations have sent 350000 troops to the gulf region 
they include 230000 american troops and 200000 more are on the 
way the multinational force faces an estimated 460000 iraqi 
troops stationed in kuwait and southern iraq 
iraq indicated it would strengthen its army even at the cost of 
cutting food production a government decree published in baghdad 
newspapers said farmers who had formerly been exempted from 
military service would now be called to serve official iraqi 
sources said an estimated 60000 farmers most of them military 
reservists would be called up in the next few days 
the iraqi news agency report on rationing in kuwait said 
preparations were under way to distribute ration cards to citizens 
and oreigners it did not specify what foodstuffs were involved 
but bread sugar meat and milk are all rationed in iraq 
a spokesman for the kuwaiti governmentinexile abdelrazzaq 
saqer had few details about the reported attack by resistance 
fighters on ali hassan majeed the iraqiappointed governor of 
kuwait he cited kuwaiti exiles as saying the governor had been 
wounded in the shoulder in the attack by resistance fighters 
no date was given for the reported attack 
majeed was appointed as governor after the iraqi takeover but 
earlier this month without explanation saddam named a new 
governor

authorities investigating the slayings 
of five college students have not charged a suspect three months 
later despite one of the most intense murder probes in florida 
history 
but while some outside law enforcement officials dont hold out 
much hope investigators remain optimistic they will ultimately 
track down the killer 
authorities have spent 25 million to send 75 investigators out 
to follow some 5500 leads since the killings in late august 
this isnt television said win phillips secondincommand 
at the alachua county sheriffs office its been timeconsuming 
laborintensive and costly 
last month edward humphrey earlier identified as a suspect in 
the case was sentenced to 22 months in a prison mental institution 
for beating his grandmother the 19yearold student was never 
charged in the slayings 
the first two victims were found stabbed and mutilated aug 26 
sonja larson 18 of deerfield beach and christina powell 17 of 
jacksonville were both university of florida students 
christa hoyt 17 a student at nearby santa fe community 
college was found the next day beheaded university of florida 
students tracy paules and manuel taboada both 23 of miami were 
found the day after that stabbed to death 
since then a task force of investigators from the fbi 
gainesville police alachua county sheriffs office florida 
department of law enforcement and florida highway patrol have said 
little about their progress 
i feel confident were going to ultimately resolve this thing 
because of the quantity and quality of the resources working on 
this said state attorney len register the legends of the fdle 
are up here working on this case 
but outsiders are not convinced an arrest is imminent or even 
likely 
michael west a mississippi forensic expert scoured the murder 
scenes with special laser equipment looking for fingerprints 
footprints blood or fibers police may have missed he said he had 
never seen a crime scene so clean in 13 years of such work 
this person didnt leave them anything to work with west 
said he didnt wake up one morning and decide to kill he did 
some planning and was careful 
theyre in a hell of a bind said leon county sheriffs 
capt steve bodiford who helped investigate the ted bundy serial 
murder case in the late 1970s bundy confessed to killing 23 young 
women 
what do you do if you have no evidence you run all the leads 
down and try to develop new leads its tough bodiford said 
leon county incorporates tallahassee in northwest florida 
so many leads are being pursued that the task force has 
discouraged victims families and the university from offering 
rewards a traditional way of generating leads 
theyre afraid of leaks so theyre not telling us anything 
said ada larson mother of one of the victims recently they 
dont return my calls 
mario taboada whose brother was killed said he would let the 
investigation take its course 
ive been very patient because i know every little item 
picked up needs to be written up documented processed he said 
obviously thats timeconsuming 
meanwhile university officials worry that students have grown 
complacent 
campus police spokesman angie tipton said students have since 
dropped their guard walking alone at night leaving doors and 
windows unlocked 
its like nothing ever happened ms tipton said we try 
to remind them that the victims were just like they are vulnerable 
and trusting
