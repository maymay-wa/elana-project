the hardline communist party 
chief and ruling politburo resigned friday forced from power by a 
week of massive prodemocracy protests that surpassed even the 
prague spring of 1968 
milos jakes became the third soviet bloc leader to be swept out 
of office in a stunning fiveweek wave of political upheaval that 
has washed over the communist world in eastern europe 
the party central committee elected littleknown karel urbanek 
member of the partys politburo only since october 1988 to replace 
jakes who resigned along with the rest of the 13man politburo and 
secretariat 
at the end of a 16hour closeddoor session that lasted until 
early saturday the central committee reshuffled the politburo 
shrinking it to nine members it elected urbanek and five holdovers 
along with three new men josef cizek miroslav huscava and 
miroslav zajic 
premier ladislav adamec who broke with years of policy this 
week by meeting opposition activists was among those politburo 
members who lost their seats meaning a new premier will likely be 
named soon 
thousands of people poured into wenceslas square friday night 
dancing singing and popping champagne corks at the news of the 
resignations the celebration one week after police clubbed 
peaceful protesters capped a day in which 300000 people jammed 
the square for the triumphant return of alexander dubcek the bold 
reformer ousted in 1968 
an old wise man said if there once was light why should 
there be darkness again let us act in such a way to bring the 
light back again dubcek had told the jubilant crowd 
later when he heard the news of the resignations dubcek and 
top dissidents at a news conference jumped to their feet shouted 
hooray and hugged each other joyously 
after the sovietled warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia in 
august 1968 dubcek was ousted from the communist party in disgrace 
zdenek horeni editor in chief of the party newspaper rude 
pravo held a news conference early saturday after the central 
committee meeting ended and he was asked about dubceks future 
he said dubcek was expelled because he completely failed as 
party and state representative i personally doubt that alexander 
dubcek could possibly be readmitted to the czechslovak party 
there was no immediate response to the resignations from student 
and intellectual leaders who had called for a general strike on 
monday to force jakes to step down 
urbanek 48 is the former party leader of the czech republic 
he was a surprise choice to replace jakes and represented a break 
with the rigid policies in place since the invasion his selection 
on a vote of 1367 seemed designed to boost the partys flagging 
standing after a week of nationwide calls for its reformresistant 
leaders to resign 
jakes said the party had not instituted reforms quickly enough 
and had underestimated the effect of the prodemocracy movement 
sweeping eastern europe 
in washington the state department said it hoped urbanek will 
act swiftly to address the longawaited desires of the 
czechoslovakian people for civil liberties political freedom and 
basic human rights british prime minister margaret thatcher 
also in washington said we have great hopes that czechoslovakia 
will also become a democracy 
in a terse dispatch the official news agency ctk announced 
the general secretary of the czechoslovak communist party 
milos jakes and all other members of the politburo and secretariat 
submitted their resignations so that a new leadership of the party 
could be elected jakes said he hoped the newly elected organs of 
the party will contribute to a more resolute implementation of the 
process of restructuring and democratization 
restructuring and democratization have been key terms used by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who has inspired the reforms 
that have swept through his own nation poland hungary east 
germany and bulgaria 
czechoslovakias leaders who were installed after the warsaw 
pact invasion had resisted most of the reforms adopted by their 
formerly hardline communist allies earlier this year however 
they allowed thousands of east german refugees to pass through 
czechoslovakia on their way to west germany 
since nov 17 hundreds of thousands of people have filled the 
streets of prague and other cities demanding democratic reforms and 
the end of the communists monopoly on power they have been the 
largest demonstrations in the nations history 
for a week our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere 
accompanied by large demonstrations ctk quoted jakes as saying 
the tension is gradually spreading to other places in the 
republic we must openly say that our country is at a fateful 
crossroads 
we have underestimated completely the processes taking place 
in poland hungary and especially recently in east germany and 
their effect and influence on our society said jakes who was 
responsible for the expulsion from the party of half a million 
communists including dubcek 
in december 1987 jakes was named communist party chief to 
succeed gustav husak who came to power in april 1969 eight months 
after the invasion jakes 67 was seen as a bureaucrat and party 
functionary whose speeches and personality have made little or no 
public impact despite his long years in high office 
dubcek 67 made his first public appearance in prague since the 
party purge in june 1970 since his ouster he has worked as a 
lowlevel employee of the state forestry services and has lived in 
virtual seclusion 
dubcek dubcek and long live dubcek the flagwaving 
crowd yelled as he appeared in wenceslas square the site of 
repeated prodemocracy demonstrations he urged them to unite to 
improve the country 
the ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the 
conditions of a new generation dubcek said we must unify to 
raise our country to a higher level 
prodemocracy demonstrations also were held in the cities of 
bratislava brno kosice ostrava and usti nad labem according to 
staterun media 
dubcek threw his support behind the civil forum an opposition 
group formed sunday to guide czechoslovakias prodemocracy 
movement 
he appealed to police militia and the army to stand by the 
peoples side and not to destroy the search for democracy 
do not act against the people remember you are from the 
people dubcek said he also told demonstrators to avoid 
extremist trends 
riot police beat hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in the 
square on nov 17 sparking a week of growing protests police have 
kept a generally low profile since then 
playwright vaclav havel czechoslovakias most prominent 
dissident then spoke to the crowd and told them that civic forum 
is ready to negotiate with the authorities elsewhere than on the 
streets 
but its not up to us but to them whether democracy will 
arise from the excited atmosphere on the square it is their turn 
to move not ours havel said

a growing drug trade has led to 
concern that the philippines is in danger of becoming the colombia 
of the far east calls are going out for tougher laws and the death 
penalty for drug dealers 
police say the illegal drug trade has become a 41 
millionayear business in recent years the three largest drug 
syndicates employ about 15000 people fulltime according to police 
estimates 
the trade comes nowhere near that of colombias 
multibilliondollar drug cartels but experts here say most of the 
narcotics produced in the philippines are used locally 
but filipino and foreign experts fear the country could become a 
major regional drug center because of a favorable climate for 
growing marijuana corruption and inefficiency within the police 
and established trade and communications links to the united states 
and other markets 
in october us agents in los angeles seized two tons of 
philippinegrown marijuana worth 14 million in what was believed 
to be an attempt to establish a pipeline between manila and 
california 
two americans of filipino ancestry were arrested recently in 
honolulu for allegedly trying to smuggle in two pounds of the drug 
crystal methamphetamine a widely abused drug known in southeast 
asia as shabu and said by officials and drug experts to be more 
addictive than crack 
philippinegrown marijuana and other drugs also have turned up 
albeit in modest amounts in australia hong kong taiwan japan 
pakistan turkey and some european countries police say 
foreign and filipino narcotics officials say syndicates have 
been bringing in foreigners mostly europeans to teach growers 
here how to grow better quality marijuana 
last year police uprooted 15 million marijuana plants and 
seized 75 tons of marijuana packed for shipment abroad 
if we do not do something about this there might come a time 
when we will see the spectacle of the philippines becoming like 
colombia where drug lords even have armies helicopters planes 
and even tanks sen alberto romulo said at a recent philippine 
senate hearing 
public concern over the problem began to grow in october after 
sen ernesto herrera charged that at least 17 police and military 
members including a brigadier general were protecting drug lords 
according to the police the drug trade is flourishing because 
of the potential for huge profits in a country where the annual per 
capita income is only about 600 
marijuana can be bought in remote mountain plantations for 200 
pesos 9 a kilo 22 pounds and sold in manila for 10 times as 
much 
shabu the crystaline drug can be purchased in hong kong for 
about 2270 a kilo and sold in manila for the equivalent of 
45450 sources say some shabu also is being made locally 
corruption among police and customs officials is said to 
compound the enforcement problem 
col virgilio david chief of the national police narcotics 
command said his unit is riddled with corruption because poorly 
paid policemen find it difficult to turn down bribes from drug 
syndicates he said at least 40 of his officers and men had been 
removed in an attempt to combat corruption 
david and others say stronger laws and greater police powers are 
needed in the philippines 
in hong kong if you go there and the police doubt your 
papers they can just detain you david said that is the same 
case in singapore and malaysia they have stronger laws that 
empower the police to arrest anybody based only on strong suspicion 
that they are a violators of the law we must have the same kind of 
laws here 
david said the military has urged congress to revive the death 
penalty for drug dealers the constitution ratified in 1987 
abolished capital punishment but allows congress to revive it for 
heinous crimes 
he also said the government should establish special courts to 
handle only drug offenses to speed up trials which often drag on 
here for years 
because of legal obstacles in enforcing the laws critics say 
police often simply execute bigtime dealers and then report that 
they were killed in a shootout 
in the manila area alone at least 22 drug pushers have been 
killed in shootouts with police since herrera made his charges 
about the police and military in october 
sen neptali gonzalez a former justice secretary said the 
killings should persuade drug dealers to turn themselves in and 
seek government protection 
otherwise they may soon find themselves targets of 
elimination he said

general motors is trying to stuff a bigger air 
conditioner into its cars while american telephone amp telegraph is 
revising decadesold assembly line practices 
the changes come as industry under pressure from government and 
environmentalists seeks to eliminate the use of 
chlorofluorocarbons the onetime wonder chemical that has been 
destroying the earths ozone layer 
but the task is more complicated than simply replacing an old 
chemical with a new one government and industry experts say 
the transition is going to take time were talking about 
retrofitting not one industry but several industries says fa 
tony vogelsberg environmental manager for the freon division 
at du pont a major producers of cfcs 
cfcs discovered in 1928 help cool houses in the summer and 
keep them warm in the winter they are used to make the foam 
cushions on couches in pillows even in stuffed toys 
without them refrigerators would not cool as well radios 
televisions stereos or home computers might not work as well and 
items from coaxial cables to mailed christmas gifts might not have 
as much packaging protection 
but cfcs also have a dark side when they float 10 to 30 miles 
above the earth to the stratosphere their chlorine component eats 
away at the ozone shield that protects against the suns 
cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
industrial nations want to ban all cfc production within the 
next decade but while a halfdozen or more replacements are under 
study they all have some drawbacks and no single substitute is 
expected to be found 
i dont think theres going to be a substitute that is going 
to be given an aplus on all areas of concern said eileen 
claussen director of atmospheric and indoor air programs at the 
environmental protection agency were going to have to make some 
tradeoffs 
the epa is examining the array of substitutes mainly a family 
of chemicals called hcfcs to determine whether they are toxic or 
pose other health concerns and how significantly they harm the 
environment the hcfcs also deplete ozone but much less severely 
we clearly do not want to blunder along and create a new 
health or environmental problem while solving the ones that we 
targeted said charles elkins whose epa office is reviewing the 
potential toxicity of some cfc substitutes 
every year more than 2 billion pounds of cfcs are produced 
worldwide a third of them in the united states 
the united states banned use of the chemical in aerosol cans in 
1978 four years after the first concerns about the ozone layer 
were raised still the operation of more than 135 billion worth 
of equipment nationwide is dependent on cfcs 
industry turned to cfcs because they do not burn or corrode 
metal pose no direct health hazards to workers and hold heat and 
cold making them ideal insulators 
that was before their threat to the ozone layer was understood 
half of the ozone over antarctica was destroyed during september 
and october 1987 causing a hole in the earths protective shield 
that closes and reappears with the seasons severe destruction of 
the ozone layer is believed to be occurring over the south pole 
again this year according to scientists they say the conditions 
for ozone destruction are present over the arctic although no 
massive loss of ozone has been observed there 
several large corporations have announced plans to end their 
reliance on cfcs some by the early 1990s these include such 
giants as atampt ibm boeing and general electric 
we have used cfc solvents and cleaners for so long theyre 
almost ingrained in the manufacturing process says david 
chittick vice president for environment and safety at atampt 
nevertheless atampt hopes to end all uses of cfcs by 1994 
the major automakers are developing substitutes and are 
designing new air conditioning units to accommodate the changeover 
probably in the mid1990s 
but the new air conditioners will be less energy efficient and 
require larger compressors experts say we feel we can do it 
without any dramatic effects on the look or design of the car its 
going to be difficult though says toni simonetti a gm 
spokeswoman 
congress is considering legislation calling for the elimination 
of cfcs by the year 2000 and at least 20 states are reviewing 
proposals aimed at curbing cfc pollution vermont has banned the 
use of cfcs in auto air conditioners after 1994 
du pont has spent more than 100 million on research for cfc 
substitutes and estimates it will spend as much as 1 billion to 
build production plants and to cover other costs during a 10year 
transition period ici americas another major manufacturer also 
has spent 100 million in cfc replacement research and recently 
announced plans to begin production of a substitute cooling agent 
by 1992 at a new louisiana plant 
but developing substitute chemicals will not be enough 
as much as 30 percent of todays cfc demand will have to be 
eliminated by conservation and recycling government and industry 
experts say major appliance manufacturers as well as automakers 
recently have supplied their repair shops with equipment to capture 
cfcs rather than let the old coolant vent into the air 
but epa and industry officials acknowledge that routine venting 
of old cfcs is still widespread 
shifts to new manufacturing procedures or altogether new 
technology could account for a 30 percent reduction in cfc demand 
especially in the electronics industry the experts say 
but some critics say that industry is slow to accept new 
technology what were facing is inertia says marc goldberg of 
crynodynamics a new jerseybased company that is producing a 
refrigeration system using helium as a cooling agent the system is 
being marketed primarily for commercial uses the major automakers 
have expressed little interest 
companies such as atampt and northern telecom are turning to new 
manufacturing procedures such as using lowsolid fluxes to reduce 
leftover residues and eliminate the need for cfcs as a solvent for 
cleaning circuit boards after soldering 
this cfc problem has caused a whole new review of the way we 
do business says ad fitzgerald director of environmental 
affairs at northern telecom a canadianbased manufacturer of 
telephone equipment 
the thorniest problems have emerged in the area of refrigeration 
and air conditioning because all substitutes under consideration 
pose energy and environmental tradeoffs particularly in the area 
of global warming 
a bill putting a time limit on use of hcfcs as substitutes for 
chlorofluorocarbons has been approved by a senate environmental 
subcommittee but its prospects in congress are uncertain 
environmentalists say meanwhile that even the less potent 
hcfcs would be a dangerous threat to ozone depletion if the amount 
used worldwide is dramatically increased over the next century 
the hcfc family of substitutes should be looked at only as a 
bridge solution and industry should not be allowed to sit 
back and be happy once they made the onestep transition says 
david doniger an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council

arriving at work one recent 
morning adolfo perez esquivel winner of the 1980 nobel peace 
prize found his office had been vandalized 
an interior door was smashed open and thieves took a computer 
files and typewriters from his workplace in a dilapidated building 
in a rundown neighborhood 
they werent common criminals but the forces of national 
insecurity the human rights advocate said in an interview 
they stole everything and the police did absolutely nothing 
perez esquivel 59 recounted the incident matteroffactly 
convinced the breakin stemmed from his vocal opposition to an oct 
7 presidential pardon of soldiers accused of human rights abuses 
and his efforts to call attention to societys downtrodden 
the nobel prize opened a lot of doors and possibilities 
except in my own country where an effort continues to 
permanently silence our work he said 
the mild mannered slightly built son of a spanish fisherman 
taught architecture at the university of la plata until he became 
enmeshed in human rights causes during argentinas turbulent 1970s 
while leftists with guns and bombs tried to bring down the 
elected government of president isabel peron and the military 
regime that succeeded it perez esquivel preached social change 
through nonviolence 
in 1973 he founded the peace and justice service which has 
branches in 11 latin american countries two years later he helped 
set up the permanent assembly for human rights 
both organizations protested the arrests and presumed killings 
of thousands of alleged leftists who disappeared during the 
197683 dictatorship 
despite the work of his organizations and his detention without 
charges for 15 months in 1977 and 1978 perez esquivel was little 
known even in argentina when the nobel committee announced his name 
in october 1980 
since then perez esquivel has achieved a certain international 
stature although nothing like that of other nobel laureates such 
as mother teresa andrei sakharov lech walesa or archbishop 
desmond tutu 
these days perez esquivel puts together proposals to raise 
funds from churches and agencies in the united states and europe 
travels and writes 
he and a small staff mostly volunteers help poor people get 
legal title to land on which they work or live set up shelters for 
abandoned children organize soup kitchens and clothing drives for 
the needy 
most any rally in support of democracy civil rights or social 
welfare can count on his presence his signature on petitions his 
voice 
he genuinely feels his ideals said the director of the 
human rights group legal and social studies center emilio mignone 
a friend for 15 years he is a very simple man ethical 
generous 
perez esquivel also can be disorganized and quixotic however 
and that colleagues say has hampered his effectiveness 
his peace and justice service is neither the biggest nor most 
prestigious human rights group in argentina 
leaders of other groups who also protested at personal risk 
the atrocities of the dirty war against leftist subversion 
hoped perez esquivels distinction would make it easier to 
influence popular opinion and public policy 
that has not happened the government treats perez esquivel as a 
gadfly and his peace and justice service lacks the staff and the 
clout to deliver people to rallies or push an idea in the public 
consciousness 
hes more important internationally than in argentina said 
hebe de bonafini a founder another human rights group the mothers 
of the plaza de mayo i think he could have done more things 
before he had more impact than now 
perez esquivels politics are openly left of center companies 
and natural resources should be kept in state hands even if they 
lose money or the government has no ability to exploit them he 
says criticizing plans to privatize them 
the foreign debt is unpayable he says workers should receive 
higher salaries businesses should be compelled to be more 
productive the government should insist that capital flight cease 
weapons manufacturers should be convinced to make nonlethal 
products 
and the servicemen who committed human rights abuses should be 
tried by elected president carlos menems government he says 
despite open resistence from sectors of the armed forces 
despite the seriousness of his causes his maintains a cheerful 
disposition and says he bears no hatred to those who imprisoned him 
or threatened him his wife or his three children 
im optimistic by nature he said i try to contribute to 
make things a little better i hope my life has been useful

an assistant principal who got fed up 
with his students sloppy habits tried to teach them a lesson in 
table manners by taking away the cafeteria tables 
teens in two of the three lunch periods at erwin high school ate 
on the floor wednesday after assistant principal robin thomas 
ordered the tables taken down 
what we did today we did to get their attention thomas 
said i hope we got it 
thomas said school administrators had warned students for two 
weeks to clean up after themselves or risk losing their tables 
the problem has been that weve had some pigs eating in the 
cafeteria at least you might call them that from the look of the 
place after they finish thomas said 
but some students and their parents found the tactic severe 
the floor is something people walk on not eat on its 
nasty said mandy dewitt a junior who left school rather than 
dine on the linoleum they are punishing all of us for the 
actions of a few and thats not right 
her mother brenda dewitt said thomas punished a lot of kids 
who did nothing wrong and i think they forgot they were dealing 
with children not prisoners in a war camp 
thomas responded the students were not kept from eating what 
we were trying to teach them is that there are consequences for 
their actions 
tracey christopher another junior who left school at lunchtime 
said the action was illtimed as well as unfair because she and 
other students had donated blood that day

the soviet union is conducting one of 
the largest aid programs in its history to support the government 
in kabul transporting billions of dollars in weapons food and 
fuel to the wartorn nation 
beginning at least one year before the red army withdrew in 
february 1989 the operation has brought hundreds of thousands of 
tons of commodities to afghanistan the staterun press has 
reported 
another 3 billion in military aid including advanced weapons 
is supplied annually eastern european diplomats said 
the united states gives the antigovernment guerrillas an 
estimated 500 million worth of arms a year 
if we didnt have food from the soviet union we would 
starve says massuma esmaty wardak president of the afghanistan 
womens council we have no one else to turn to 
the massive operation indicates the commitment moscow has made 
to the kabul government which came to power in a bloody communist 
coup in 1978 soviet troops arrived the following year to prop up 
the faltering marxist regime 
after the red army ended its decadelong military intervention 
in february western diplomats predicted a quick victory for the 
guerrillas but kabul didnt fall 
the rebels failed to unite and soviet aid gave the government 
the firepower and food it needed 
the west underestimated the soviet commitment everyone 
thought the red army was retreating and had lost the war said 
one diplomat who has been counting transport planes and trucks for 
the past nine months only now do we know how serious the 
russians really were 
for their aid the soviets get a pliant government on its 
southern border that helps offset neighboring irans islamic 
fundamentalism and pakistans proamericanism 
in late october the daily payam official organ of the ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan published an unusually 
detailed account of soviet aid 
from february to august it said 266543 metric tons of soviet 
goods crossed through the border town of hayratan 
among the goods more than 40000 tons of fuel 82000 tons of 
wheat 1000 tons of cooking oil 900 tons of sugar and 540 tons of 
flour rolled into afghanistan on more than 21000 soviet trucks 
the newspaper said 
the united nations says another 220000 tons of sovietsupplied 
flour some of it purchased from the united states and australia 
is in the pipeline 
also since february 168750 tons of goods have arrived in kabul 
aboard 6750 soviet transport planes diplomats said 
diplomats estimated that until recently the airlift contained 75 
percent weapons and 25 percent food but afghan officials 
reportedly have asked that the food portion be raised to 40 percent 
in view of the coming winter and the countrys serious 
transportation problems caused by war bad roads and harsh weather 
to help with this problem the soviets recently gave kabul 2200 
heavy duty trucks the staterun bakhtar news agency reported last 
month tens of thousands of vehicles had already been left behind 
by the red army when it pulled out 
diplomats said the duration and size of the operation make it 
one of the biggest aid programs in soviet history rivaled only by 
soviet aid to cuba and vietnam 
the costs are tremendous and we believe that not even moscow 
knows how much it is paying said one highranking asian diplomat 
whose country is friendly with both moscow and kabul 
in the military sphere diplomats in kabul and islamabad say 
that since 1988 about 200 million to 300 million in weapons have 
been crossing the soviet border each month 
diplomats from two eastern european countries who provided the 
3 billion annual estimate said moscow has promised to provide 
afghanistan with two advanced weapons the scud500 an updated 
version of the mediumrange missiles already supplied to kabul and 
the mig29 an advanced combat jet the soviets already have given 
afghanistan more than 150 planes for its air force mostly mig21 
fighters 
afghanistan also has received air defense rockets according to 
the april 29 edition of the staterun kabul times which carried a 
photograph of the weapons on its front page 
some diplomats challenged attempts to estimate the value of 
soviet military aid because accounting methods vary from country to 
country 
diplomats in kabul and pakistan say afghanistan has fired 1000 
scud missiles in the past year at the rebels each rocket costs 
about 1 million on the arms market bringing the scuds total cost 
to 1 billion 
but they contend the missiles are valueless because moscow 
probably would have destroyed the weapons which were orginally 
built to carry nuclear warheads and use 1960s technology 
in addition to aid the soviet union occupies a commanding 
position in afghanistans economy 
soviet economic ties account for 60 percent of afghanistans 
state budget and 75 percent of its industrial output the daily 
payam said in november 
soviet assistance is used in the production of 100 percent of 
afghanistans natural gas 100 percent of its chemical fertilizer 
and 60 percent of its electricity the payam said 
since the 1954 signing of the first afghansoviet long term 
credit agreement moscow has had close economic ties with kabul 
soviet aid built housing roads and bridges and generated power 
in 1956 the two nations signed an agreement for the training and 
modernization of afghanistans armed forces the military led the 
communist revolution in 1978 
since the soviet intervention afghanistan has become 
increasingly isolated economically 
the usbacked rebels have cut the road to pakistan which 
carried flour and cooking oil trade with iran is minimal among 
the industrialized nations only japan which exports about 100 
million a year has substantial economic ties

i am numb from all those years of waiting waiting 
in vain says cardinal myroslav lubachivsky but the wait is 
nearly over 
few perhaps have more riding on pope john paul iis meeting dec 
1 with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev than lubachivsky head of 
the ukrainian catholic church 
the historic encounter holds out the prospect that the ukrainian 
church will be legalized after 43 years of suppression and 
lubachivsky will be able to return to his homeland for the first 
time in 51 years 
were optimistic about it yes the 75yearold former 
metropolitanarchbishop of philadelphia said in an interview but 
to have too much hope too much trust is not good there is a 
polish proverb hope is mother of the stupid people so its 
better just to be practical and wait to see what happens 
still lubachivsky sees concrete signs the popes talks with 
gorbachev will pave the way for legalization of the ukrainian 
church in the next two months 
he said information coming from the soviet union indicates the 
government has already approved the basis of a new law on religion 
which would give all churches the same legal status under the 
constitution 
we expect this will become law around the middle or end of 
january lubachivsky said 
he says soviet authorities have adopted a much more tolerant 
attitude toward the ukrainian catholics in the past few months 
allowing them to celebrate mass in public import bibles and 
communicate by fax with church groups in the west 
it is in gorbachevs interests to legalize the church of more 
than 4 million followers in the soviet unions second largest 
republic the cardinal said 
if mr gorbachev would like to have the moral support of the 
holy father this is the condition that he could get it 
lubachivsky said he needs this hell also have the support from 
the western countries he needs the money from the west 
legalizing the ukrainian church could also lead to the first 
papal visit to the soviet union john paul frequently has expressed 
the wish to travel to the ukraine and lithuania 
we would invite him as soon as we are free lubachivsky 
said i think he would not refuse 
lubachivsky credits the polishborn pope a fellow slav for 
helping bring the ukrainian church out of the catacombs and to the 
brink of legalization 
he is the greatest friend of ours and he has always assured me 
he would be staying fast for the legalization of our church he 
said 
ukrainian catholics practice the byzantine or eastern rite but 
look to rome for guidance and recognize the authority of the pope 
the ukrainian church which traces its history to the 
introduction of christianity in the region 1000 years ago was 
suppressed in 1946 by soviet dictator josef stalin it was forcibly 
merged with the russian orthodox church and its clergy were 
arrested deported or shot 
the church continued to flourish underground however with 
priests and bishops ordained and consecrated in secret encouraged 
by gorbachevs glasnost policies church officials and faithful 
have come out in the open in the past two years to demand official 
recognition 
church officials in the west estimate there are 12 catholic 
bishops 1000 priests and 1200 monks and nuns in the ukraine 
lubachivsky was born in dolyna western ukraine in 1914 he 
left in 1937 when the ukraine was under polish occupation to study 
in austria switzerland and italy he moved to the united states in 
1947 and became an american citizen 
the pope appointed lubachivsky as metropolitanarchbishop of 
philadelphia in 1979 and made him cardinal six years later he 
replaced cardinal josyf slipyj who died in 1984 as leader of 
ukrainian catholics 
if the church is legalized lubachivsky said he would return to 
the ukraine if permitted by soviet authorities and organize the 
hierarchy 
i would like to see how the country looks because for 50 years 
i havent seen anything he said i would like to see for 
myself how the people are living most of my family has died but i 
would like to see if there are any relatives left 
a major stumbling block to legalization has been the opposition 
of the russian orthodox church which stands to lose some 450 
churches it took over from the catholics after 1946 
up until now the people were worshiping in forests in the 
streets in private houses lubachivsky said thats not the 
way to worship god 
vatican officials have held periodic negotiations with the 
russian orthodox church but lubachivsky contends only the soviet 
government can resolve the dispute by giving the churches back

the assassination of president rene 
mouawad leaves lebanon staring into the abyss as it has so often 
since a seemingly endless civil war began 14 years ago 
mouawad was trying to assemble a government that could end the 
war his death wednesday after only 17 days as president raised 
the possibility of more fighting between the 40000 syrian soldiers 
in lebanon and gen michel aoun the christian army commander 
the assassination underlined the dangers of trying to achieve 
peace in a deeply divided land that has become a proxy battleground 
for rival powers in the middle east 
one clear motive for killing mouawad was to undermine the peace 
agreement reached by lebanese legislators oct 24 in taif saudi 
arabia after weeks of negotiations mediated by the arab league 
many earlier attempts to end the war which has cost more than 
150000 lives since 1975 have been wrecked by one or more of the 
many factions involved 
amin gemayel who was lebanons last president and left office 
last fall scuttled a syrianarranged peace treaty signed in 
december 1985 by leaders of the main moslem and christian militias 
he contended it stripped maronite catholics of the power they have 
held since independence from france in 1943 
mouawad also was a maronite the main christian sect in lebanon 
as lebanese presidents traditionally have been 
if supporters of the taif accord hope to save it they must move 
swiftly to elect another president acceptable both to syria the 
main power broker in lebanon and the moslem and christian factions 
more than a score of people were killed with mouawad an 
advocate of reconciliation when a remotecontrolled bomb 
containing an estimated 550 pounds of explosives went off in a 
crowded street as his motorcade passed 
there was no claim of responsibility but the murky world of 
lebanese and middle east politics contains no shortage of suspects 
syria which supports the taif accord quickly pointed the 
finger at aoun the main christian opponent of the plan 
president hafez assad of syria clearly referred to the general 
when he called the assassination a new impulse to double the 
support for lebanon so that it can destroy the evil in its nest and 
in order for the lebanese to avenge themselves against those 
who wanted with their crime to hit lebanons unity and prolong the 
suffering of the lebanese 
assad did not elaborate but his remarks indicated syria might 
use the slaying to justify a move against aoun 
israels chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said in tel aviv 
the syrians probably would attack aoun who commands about 20000 
men in christian units of the lebanese army 
yossi olmert an israeli government official said the losers 
are the syrians and those who gained are all those who think that 
an elected president in lebanon would be bad for their interests 
an arab analyst said privately the gainers include syria and 
israel 
a unified lebanese government would be able to ask the syrians 
to leave which the syrians dont want to do he said if the 
syrians went then the israelis would have to get out of the border 
enclave they occupy in south lebanon 
aoun has said the taif agreement is a betrayal because it does 
not provide for speedy withdrawal of the 40000 syrian soldiers 
who are in lebanon under an arab league peacekeeping mandate issued 
in 1976 
he fought an artillery war of liberation against the syrians 
that lasted six months until the arab league arranged a truce sept 
22 more than 900 people were killed and nearly 3000 wounded most 
of them civilians 
the fundamentalist shiite moslem militia hezbollah and its 
iranian sponsors also oppose the peace accord hezbollah says it 
ignores the demands of the 12 million shiites the largest sect in 
lebanon for more political power 
druse moslem chief walid jumblatt has gone along with the 
agreement albeit grudgingly to please his syrian allies but has 
made clear he does not feel it goes far enough in curbing maronite 
privilege 
some lebanese see the hand of iraq syrias archrival in the 
arab world and aouns main supporter in the assassination of 
mouawad president saddam hussein of iraq a sworn enemy of assad 
went along with the taif accord only after saudi arabia threatened 
to cut off aid

japans judicial setup may appear similar to 
systems in the west but in japan strip searches are routine 
lengthy delays occur in setting bail and the odds of being found 
innocent are 1in15000 an expert says 
there are many peculiar traditions said hiroshi itakura 
professor of criminal law at nippon university 
the traditions and customs which play a strong role at all 
levels of japanese society may pose other hurdles for the 12 
politicians bureaucrats or business executives charged with 
bribery in the influencepeddling scandal known as the recruit 
affair the first of five separate trials begins friday 
the japanese judiciary system may look similar to that of 
ordinary western democratic countries on the surface but it 
differs a great deal in substance itakura said 
in a typical criminal case suspects are required to undergo a 
physical examination completely naked at the beginning of police 
investigation following arrest 
police can question suspects for up to 48 hours before sending 
them to prosecutors who have 20 days to interrogate them before 
filing formal charges with the court the suspect is permitted to 
have a lawyer present during interrogation 
an arrested person has no chance of being released on bail until 
prosecutors complete their investigation 
hiromasa ezoe the central figure in the recruit bribery case 
was arrested feb 13 and held until june 6 when he was released on 
14 million bail he was charged with seven counts of bribery of 
politicians and public officials 
defendants do not enter a formal plea until their trials start 
and there is no plea bargaining beforehand there is no chance to 
sway a jury trials are decided by a single judge at the district 
court level and judges hardly ever give innocent verdicts 
the chance that the court will find a suspect innocent is only 
one out of 15000 said itakura i think it reflects a 
homogeneous society where judges prosecutors and defense attorneys 
all share a similar sense of justice and fairness 
if ezoes trial goes by the usual pattern in japan his 18 
defense lawyers will try to draw the case out and reduce the 
penalty after the virtually inevitable guilty verdict 
since there is no plea bargaining a defendant may want to plead 
innocent but a judge may take that as a sign of a lack of 
repentance and impose a stiffer sentence 
once you are arrested for wrongdoing it is hard to expect 
fairness of the western standard in this country said itakura 
i guess it depends on how you define fairness but in general 
the japanese judiciary system is made in such a way that tends to 
be quite cruel to criminals

for former secretary of state william rogers 
the reunification of west and east germany will be a reality when 
the longdivided german nation fields a single olympic athletic 
team 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger thinks 
reunification will come much sooner perhaps within five years 
former secretary of state dean rusk who marvels at the changes 
being wrought in eastern europe believes it is far too early to 
even discuss reunification and that doing so before events sort 
themselves out is folly 
all three men had long experience sitting across the table from 
tough soviet leaders in grimmer times when the cold war was truly 
cold and the iron curtain truly iron 
all three have varying ideas about the events transforming 
eastern europe now 
rusk who was secretary of state in the kennedy administration 
when the berlin wall was built said in an interview that any 
discussion of reunification is decidedly premature 
i never thought i would live to see the day these things would 
happen in eastern europe rusk said speaking of the reform 
program of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the rise of 
democratic movements in poland and hungary the opening of the 
berlin wall and unprecedented protest demonstrations in 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria 
these are dramatic and important changes rusk said its 
too soon to tell if they are permanent but im inclined to think 
gorbachev and the other leaders have set in motion forces that are 
irresistible 
rusk noted that 20 soviet divisions remain in east germany with 
others in poland 
if gorbachev were to be replaced we could return to the cold 
war rather quickly rusk said 
in light of the uncertainties he said i deplore the 
premature discussion of german reunification in a situation moving 
so fast its folly to do that 
kissinger believes german reunification is unavoidable 
i dont believe that unification is decades away kissinger 
told abc news on sunday i really believe it will happen within 
the next decade and maybe even within the next five years 
but rogers disagrees saying whatever develops will develop 
more slowly than people think 
id like to make a wager on when germany will have just one 
team in the olympic games he said in an interview noting the 
rivalry that has existed between the two germanys in the past 
during the 40 years in which the two germanys have existed side 
by side united by a common tongue and culture divided by ideology 
and walls a lot of nationalism has developed rogers said 
the east germans he said are relatively well and inexpensively 
housed and have a reasonable chance at a good education 
i think there will be cooperative ventures between east and 
west germany rogers said but as to reunification id be 
surprised if there was a single german team before two fouryear 
olympic cycles are gone through that would be an indication that 
reunification had been completed 
rusk and rogers reject complaints by congressional democrats 
that when it comes to exploiting the opportunities presented by the 
rush of events in eastern europe president bush is overly 
timid 
my view is that we are doing the right thing rogers said 
because events and developments are changing so rapidly it makes 
no sense to announce a hard and firm policy until we see the 
results and know where things are going 
i think its unwise for the government to make strong 
statements of policy now he said being very aggressive in 
foreign policy is often just a formula for spending more money 
rusk appeared to agree with that 
im inclined to think this is a pretty good time for the 
congress to remain silent he said i realize they find that 
difficult but they also find it difficult to be subtle and 
sophisticated and tend to see things in black and white 
rogers was asked if he had any advice for bush as his december 
summit with gorbachev approaches 
keep on doing what hes doing rogers replied i think 
hes doing great

jean robocker has some real turkeys for 
neighbors but things could be worse 
they occasionally drop by for snacks and sit in her trees but 
they go to bed early and dont make much noise in fact theyve 
been so nice that shes decided she wont eat them 
these turkeys are a flock of wild ones a flock thats grown to 
about 1000 birds foraging along the banks of the flathead river 
near bigfork 
the birds troop through her yard pausing to peck at grain she 
throws to them 
but theyre still wild turkeys they dont respond to calls and 
if they arent hungry they wont show up for dinner she says 
they are not dumb like people think and thats the reason 
they have survived well she says 
robocker is familiar with the birds likes and dislikes but 
visitors seem to scare the birds away robocker says she maintains 
the neighborly relationship with the turkeys by using a point of 
animal etiquette she learned from the deer that also frequent her 
yard 
she never looks the animals in the eye

the pentagon says defense secretary dick 
cheney is considering a navy proposal to aid the antidrug war by 
posting a flotilla off colombias coast 
the proposal is among a range of ideas outlined by the heads of 
the various military branches but pentagon spokesman pete williams 
said thursday no decisions have been made on whether to accept any 
of them 
in september cheney had asked the military leaders for ideas on 
how to take a more active role in the international drug battle 
the los angeles times citing anonymous sources reported 
thursday that cheney was pretty positive toward a navy proposal 
to put an aircraft carrier battle group or a marine amphibious task 
force off the colombian coast its a done deal according to 
one administration official quoted by the newspaper 
but williams when asked about the report said its not a 
done deal 
cheney this fall asked the military leaders to keep working on 
their proposals because of legal questions and issues of 
coordination among the different service branches williams said 
an administration official who was asked about the scope of the 
flotilla proposal as outlined by the times said the report was 
not out of the realm of the things the navy has proposed 
this official who spoke on condition of anonymity said cheney 
has been busy preparing the pentagons fiveyear budget plan and 
has not concentrated in recent weeks on the various services 
antidrug proposals 
williams said it is not clear yet when the administration will 
formally announce the specific steps the pentagon plans to take in 
support of a broad governmentwide antidrug effort 
under the plan reported in the times the navy would operate an 
aircraft carrier battle group or a marine amphibious task force off 
colombia each group would be in position for one or two months 
similar to training deployments 
it was unclear whether the aircraft their carriers or assigned 
amphibious assault ships would be allowed to chase suspected drug 
traffickers into colombian territory 
it also was unclear whether one or both colombian coasts would 
be involved the country has two coasts one on the pacific ocean 
and one on the caribbean sea with the isthmus of panama between 
them

kids give up santa claus more easily than their 
parents says one santa who ought to know 
for seven years carl anderson has taken a break from his 
counseling practice to play santa and this kriss kringle earned a 
phd studying how children decide to stop believing in him 
wideeyed children this week watched as anderson 36 inspected 
the elaborate north pole set at dallas northpark center where he 
will spend the next month 
santa he said teaches children an early lesson about giving 
even though they are the recipients 
but when its time to give up the belief in a jolly old elf who 
travels to every house in the world on one magic night children 
usually are ready anderson said 
children told us that more often they felt proud and happy and 
good basically because they felt more adultlike said anderson 
who in his research at the university of texas three years ago 
interviewed 75 9 to 12yearolds and their parents 
the parents react differently 
they feel like their baby is growing up and its all going by 
too fast he said 
children reported that as early as age 5 they begin doubting 
santa claus anderson said by age 9 most have decided they dont 
believe in him 
most kids reported at least going through two or three 
christmases of increasing doubt before they decided for themselves 
to no longer believe he said so the first time they heard on 
the schoolyard somebody say santas not real it didnt 
necessarily crush them at all 
the biggest surprise of his research anderson said was that 
children understood santa as something that linked generations 
something that you go through initially as a child and participate 
in one way and then later on you go through it again as a parent 
from the other side 
older children often adopt a parental role by professing to 
believe in santa to younger siblings he said 
anderson said there is no single way for children to learn santa 
is a myth he tells parents to try to find out what the child 
believes 
to children who declare anderson is santa he gives a santa 
claus business card a response that keeps him from having to tell 
a lie 
often theyll give you an indication of what theyre looking 
for anderson said they may be looking for permission to 
continue to believe they may be wanting to say look im old 
enough now lets put the cards on the table and get straight with 
this

marine investigators are seeking the cause of 
a helicopter crash that killed the crafts pilot and copilot this 
week during carrierbased exercises in the mediterranean sea 
the two crew members were declared dead thursday following a 
20hour search by the navy and marine corps officials said 
the ahit cobra helicopter crashed and sank in the mediterranean 
during a night exercise the search for the helicopter and its 
pilot and copilot was called off at 10 am est thursday said 
capt elizabeth kerstens a marine corps spokeswoman 
they had been searching for almost a day at that point and 
decided there was no hope of finding them capt kerstens said 
the pilots have been declared dead and their remains are 
unrecovered 
the aircraft was operating from the helicopter carrier uss iwo 
jima in the western mediterranean off the coast of spain when the 
crash occurred at 221 pm est wednesday according to the marine 
corps 
capt kerstens said the cause of the crash was not immediately 
known but that an investigation has been started 
the pilot was identified as capt todd o travis 29 of 
glasgow ky and the copilotgunner as capt michael w vidusek 
28 of naperville ill travis had been in the marine corps five 
years and 10 months and vidusek and been in the service six and 
onehalf years 
the two officers were participating in a night carrier 
qualification and instrument refresher training exercise when the 
helicopter went down within sight of the ship capt kerstens said 
she said travis and vidusek were not using night vision goggles 
as a part of the exercise alleged defects in night vision goggles 
and a high rate of military helicopter accidents involving their 
use have prompted several recent congressional inquiries and 
hearings 
capt kerstens said both pilots and the iwo jima had 
participated in a 48hour navy safety standdown two weeks ago 
during which almost all routine training was suspended for reviews 
of safety procedures 
the unprecedented standdown was ordered following a string of 
10 accidents in less than a month 
the pilots were assigned to marine medium helicopter squadron 
365 which is based at the marine corps air station at new river 
nc and is part of the 24th marine expedition unit currently 
deployed with the us sixth fleet the iwo jima is based at 
norfolk va

the governments crackdown on 
the news media has kept salvadorans in the dark about the most 
dramatic fighting of the civil war and may even have cost some 
lives journalists and others say 
on nov 12 the day after leftist rebels launched their biggest 
offensive of the 10yearold struggle the rightist government of 
president alfredo cristiani imposed a state of siege 
the measure suspended rights guaranteed by the constitution 
including freedom of expression cristiani said thursday the 
suspension will last a month 
since it began the population has been able to cull only vague 
or mistaken perceptions of the battles 
in the days after the offensive was launched all radio and 
television stations were forced to join the cadena nacional 
the national network the programming of radio cuscatlan the 
military station became the only source of broadcast information 
and opinion 
early in the first week of fighting the cadena dedicated 
periodic segments to telephone callers but it screened out 
leftists 
several callers denounced the jesuit priests who ran the central 
american university outside san salvador they called the priests 
subversive ideologues and suggested they be expelled or otherwise 
punished 
on nov 16 they were indeed punished 
a group of men broke into the campus residence where six of them 
were sleeping they roused the priests their housekeeper and her 
15yearold daughter and killed them all 
jesuit authorities say two witnesses saw men in army uniforms 
enter the house before the killings 
in his homily at the priests funeral arturo rivera damas 
archbishop of san salvador cited the climate of hate fostered by 
the national network as a factor in the slayings 
the government has installed censors at all television and radio 
stations they make sure viewers and listeners find out only what 
the government believes strengthens its hand in the fighting 
predictably the guerrillas are portrayed as murderous demons 
while the armed forces are presented as the epitome of virtue 
in order to downplay the magnitude of the rebel offensive the 
simple facts even where the fighting was taking place were 
often withheld 
the radio says everything is getting back to normal and 
everything is under control of the armed forces and the government 
but look for yourself said one passerby in the soyapango 
district of the capital late last week 
he pointed down the road 
fire from assault rifles and machine guns resounded less than a 
hundred yards away where several barricaded guerrillas defended an 
intersection from army troops trying to advance 
some journalists have publicly made known their objections to 
the government interference 
on nov 22 editors and reporters of the countrys principal 
evening news program channel 12s el dia stood together before 
the camera at the shows opening as the anchor read an 
anticensorship message they then signed off indefinitely 
for ethical reasons it is impossible for us to continue our 
broadcasts said a solemn antonio mineros we cannot be what we 
are not 
others are willing only to speak privately 
because people didnt know what was going on beyond what they 
could see or hear in their own neighborhood they didnt know what 
places were dangerous and what places were safe the lack of 
information undoubtedly killed people said a prominent local 
radio and print newsman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a real fear exists that they could kill you for what you say 
even if what you say is not against the government just for 
describing objectively whats going on he said 
some opposition groups have also raised their voices 
freedom of expression has been reduced to zero making it 
tremendously difficult for the democratic opposition to fulfill its 
function said the popular christian social movement in a 
statement thursday

aids may be more widespread than previously 
thought according to a study that found the disease grossly 
underreported in south carolina 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta estimate 
that 10 percent to 30 percent of aids cases have not been properly 
reported to authorities but a study published in todays journal 
of the american medical association says that of 153 aids cases 
that should have been reported to south carolina authorities from 
january 1986 through june 1987 62 or 40 percent went 
unmentioned 
if underreporting to the degree observed in this study is 
widespread in the united states current estimates regarding the 
extent of the epidemic should be viewed with caution the 
researchers wrote in the study 
since the early 1980s 112241 aids cases have been reported 
nationwide 
dr james buehler a surveillance specialist on acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome at the cdc wrote in an editorial also 
published in todays journal underreporting minimizes the 
importance of the epidemic and threatens the public health 
response 
researchers led by a physician with south carolinas bureau of 
preventive health services discovered omissions in reporting the 
disease by examining records of nearly 600000 discharges from 
nongovernment hospitals in the state the study said 
it is unclear if the present findings apply to other states 
although it seems reasonable to assume that similar underreporting 
may exist elsewhere the researchers said 
they identified aids cases by matching symptoms reported on the 
discharge records with a classification code developed by the cdc 
cases the researchers identified as aids were then compared with 
those reported to the states aids case registry said dr george 
conway an epidemiologist who led the study and now works for the 
cdcs aids division 
aids is one of several infectious diseases that doctors are 
required under state and federal regulations to report to state 
authorities who then are to pass on the information to the cdc 
conway said 
penalties are not very stiff for nonreporting he said 
doctors dont get thrown in jail for not reporting diseases the 
worst they get is a letter 
ninetyone of the 153 cases or 595 percent were properly 
reported the study found 
patients were significantly more likely to be reported as 
aidscase persons if they were white than black and males 
patients were more frequently reported than females the 
researchers wrote 
conway said researchers could not explain why 
he speculated that some might find reporting the cases too 
timeconsuming or in states like south carolina where aids is not 
widespread doctors may fail to recognize the diseases symptons 
some doctors also might be reluctant to reveal their patients 
conditions researchers said in the study 
in september 1987 after the period examined in the study south 
carolina implemented an active surveillance program modeled 
after those in several other states said dr jeff jones south 
carolinas director of disease control and epidemiology 
under the new program state officials contact physicians for 
information on aids cases instead of waiting for them to report 
jones said 
aids cripples the bodys defenses against disease leaving a 
person prey to lifethreatening infections and certain cancers

president alfredo cristiani 
said the assault by leftist rebels was a failure and he rejected 
their conditions for peace his comments were punctuated by rebel 
bombs that exploded near his news conference 
the series of bombs exploded about five blocks from where 
cristiani was speaking to reporters thursday evening cristiani 
jumped but kept talking telling everyone not to worry no 
injuries were reported 
cristiani termed nonsense the guerrillas call for political 
negotiations leading to a ceasefire the rightist government is 
demanding a truce first then talks 
without a ceasefire the guerrillas will use the peace process 
for propaganda said cristiani 
rebel leaders traveled to caracas venezuela on thursday to 
meet with president carlos andres perez but salvadoran government 
officials didnt plan to attend the meeting dashing any hopes of 
talks 
perez however said he was in touch with cristianis government 
i will say the same things to the representatives of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front that i said to the 
ministers of the cristiani government we need to look for sincere 
solutions perez said 
meanwhile traffic moved normally in san salvador for the first 
time since nov 11 when the offensive that killed more than 1000 
people was launched in the capital and several provinces many of 
the capitals 1 million residents tried to stock up on food gas 
and other necessities 
weve been cooking with wood said truck driver israel 
herrera standing in line for a fourth day at a natural gas 
distributorship with 50 other people 
since i dont have any fuel for the truck im spending my days 
in line 
at the soyapango cemetery east of the city gravediggers buried 
five bodies that had been left at the cemetery gates and said they 
expected more work 
much of the city was blacked out after darkness and an electric 
company spokesman said damage during the battles left a 70 percent 
power outage 
cristiani said the farabundo marti national liberation front had 
used the negotiating process as a propaganda tool while it prepared 
the largest offensive of the rebels 10yearold war against 
usbacked governments 
the guerrilla group has said it launched its offensive to prove 
that it cannot be defeated and that the country cannot have peace 
without accepting the rebels as a political factor 
the guerrillas tried to steal cristianis show by setting off at 
least five small bombs in a ravine about five blocks away his news 
conference was interrupted shortly after he claimed the army 
controlled the city but he said anybody with a small group of 
people could launch terrorism 
cristiani was surprised but maintained his composure the news 
conference was interrupted for 1 minute and 34 seconds but then 
resumed even as helicopters roared overhead dropping bombs and 
rocketing the slopes of a volcano where rebels were believed to be 
hiding 
explosions continued to be heard just north of the city into the 
late evening 
the news conference was held in an openair pavillion at 
military headquarters which has been attacked numerous times 
during the war that has cost an estimated 71000 lives 
there was little fighting elsewhere as the country experienced a 
second day of relative calm 
they tried it and lost said cristiani of the rebel 
offensive he said the guerrilla group must come to its senses 
and stop its aggression against the people then we can sit down to 
look at the few things we can do to facilitate their incorporation 
into the democratic process 
fighting in the city ended wednesday morning after 12 us army 
green berets evacuated a luxury hotel that had been seized by 
rebels 
the guerrillas renewed a ceasefire proposal made earlier 
calling for a negotiations preceeding a truce the government 
maintains that a ceasefire should take place before substantive 
political and territorial discussions take place 
the guerrilla proposal included another clause rejected in the 
past that called for the armed forces to be represented at the 
talks the guerrillas say that the army holds the real power

the first trial in the scandal that felled a 
government and reshaped japans political landscape opened today 
with two defendants denying bribery charges 
the scandal is the most widespread ever in japan and the trials 
are expected to delve deeply into issues involving the structure of 
japanese society 
five separate trials are starting between today and dec 15 on 
charges against two leading politicians six bureaucrats and four 
executives of the recruit co an information services conglomerate 
the company is accused of trying to win favors and exert 
influence by showering huge donations and stock bargains on the 
elite of japanese government and business 
at todays opening session 59yearold takashi kato a former 
vice minister of labor denied doing favors for recruit in exchange 
for shares in a subsidiary of the conglomerate but he acknowledged 
netting a 49000 profit on shares bought cheaply from recruit 
i have considerably damaged the credibility of the labor 
administration and i deeply regret it kato said in tokyo 
district court where judge taketaka nakagawa presided at the 
twohour 20minute session 
his codefendant 47yearold masao tatsumi a former recruit 
executive denied playing any role as an intermediary between kato 
and recruits founder and former chairman hiromasa ezoe 
ezoe is to be tried starting dec 15 on seven counts of bribery 
the scandal centers on ezoe an ambitious entrepreneur who 
bombarded senior politicians and bureaucrats with huge donations 
and discounted shares in a recruit subsidiary 
neither of todays defendants lodged a formal plea which is not 
the procedure in japanese courts 
the prosecution alleges that kato influenced labor ministry 
regulations in a way that benefited recruits booming business of 
publishing employment magazines 
as the trials started prime minister toshiki kaifu renewed his 
pledge of political reform 
this is an incident that should never be repeated kaifu was 
quoting as saying by the kyodo news service and japan broadcasting 
corp 
kaifu said his governing liberal democratic party is following 
new guidelines curbing political donations from corporations 
i think we have to work hard on political reform he was 
quoted as saying 
in august kaifu became the third prime minister in less than a 
year after the scandal forced noboru takeshita to step down in 
june takeshitas successor sousuke uno resigned after the 
liberal democrats suffered a crushing setback in july elections for 
the upper house of parliament 
takeshita himself was found to have accepted 14 million in 
legal donations 
now before elections for the more powerful lower house expected 
early next year the new trials risk bringing out more damaging 
disclosures 
in trying the defendants prosecutors must show when a gift 
becomes a bribe the determination by the court could become a 
severe test of the close links between business and government in 
japan 
the answers wont be known in full for years given the slow 
pace of justice in japan 
the recruit case is not just another political corruption 
trial but it is a challenge to the way japan inc is set up 
today said hiroshi itakura professor of criminal law at nippon 
university japan inc is a term that refers to the relationship 
between government and business 
for those implicated in the case it is almost as if they were 
doing what everyone else was doing and one day they woke up and 
found themselves being criminal defendants in one of the largest 
bribery cases in history he said 
bribery carries a maximum fiveyear prison sentence 
defendants whose trials start later include takao fujinami a 
former chief cabinet secretary and hisashi shinto exchairman of 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp japans largest company the 
scandals drove dozens of powerful men from their positions

for ordinary east germans sweet revenge was 
a televised look inside the secrecyshrouded compound housing erich 
honecker and other ousted members of his reviled old guard 
east german television aired the highly critical report 
thursday including a talk with an indignant honecker crony who 
snapped at the inflammatory campaign waged against the 
privileges of the past 
for decades the wandlitz compound just north of east berlin 
represented the ultimate in perks for the countrys mightiest 
communists 
imported wood paneling lined the walls of the 23 houses some of 
them elegant villas bathroom fixtures rivaled those in luxurious 
houses in the west 
the compounds own grocery store featured bananas oranges and 
other fruits that were only a picturebook dream for most east 
germans 
rumors abounded of allnight parties held in honeckers wandlitz 
home attended by the ruling elite and young women recruited from 
the communist youth organization 
a high wall dozens of guards and a locked gate kept away 
wouldbe curiosityseekers from the compound scornfully called 
volvograd and honecker city only a few smuggled pictures 
existed of the inner area 
thursday nights special on staterun tv showed the insides of 
one of the houses and hinted that the furnishings may have been 
recently changed to make them look less attractive there were also 
shots of the grocery store and boutique as well as the outside of 
one fairly plain looking stuccocovered home 
it was the first such television report on the communists inner 
sanctum 
kurt hager ousted from the 21member politburo last month 
indignantly spoke to the camera team on the wandlitz grounds and 
denounced what he called a inflammatory campaign against the 
ousted honecker inner circle 
this is a necessity he snapped in defending the luxurious 
lifestyle cut off from the woes of the rest of the nation he 
bitterly told a reporter all the attention gave him the feeling he 
was living in an internment camp 
east germanys new leaders including some honecker holdovers 
have been increasingly focusing on their predecessors alleged 
abuse of powers that includes a disciplinary probe against 
honecker announced thursday night 
communist party chief egon krenz once honeckers protege 
recently moved out of wandlitz and showed a television crew around 
his new more modest home on the outskirts of berlin last weekend 
krenz told a television interviewer thursday that retirees who 
once belonged to the politburo are wandlitzs current residents 
although he did not specify how many are still there 
fourteen politburo members went into retirement when they 
were ousted in the reshuffle that brought krenz to power on oct 18 
however complicating matters somewhat is the fact that guenter 
schabowski and two other wandlitz residents are honeckerera 
holdovers in the new politburo 
wandlitz was built in 1958 after the hungarian uprising two 
years earlier made east germanys top communists fear for their 
safety the government says that the topranking party members pay 
rent to live there 
compound admnistrator gerd schmidt invited reporters from the 
nations staterun newspapers for a tour along with the television 
crew on thursday 
there were even rumors that in the last few nights there were 
lines of trucks driving out with special goods the television 
report said 
schmidt said he couldnt confirm that but like other east 
german officials claimed that the amount of western goods has been 
drastically reduced under the krenz leadership 
how long honecker and his ousted inner circle can still live 
there is uncertain 
suggestions for waldlitzs future use range from an old peoples 
home to a museum memorializing the abuses of the past 
there have been thoughts about setting it up as a medical 
facility or as a rehabilitation center to justly serve the 
people schmidt told reporters 
as krenz and his colleagues scramble to gain the trust of the 
people they also have cut out other privileges including opening 
up oncerestricted hunting areas to the general public 
many of the nations star athletes have come under criticism for 
the perks they have long enjoyed

mothers who take multiple vitamins containing 
folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear 
babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects a new 
study concludes 
the birth defects were about onefourth as common among babies 
whose mothers took the overthecounter vitamins than among babies 
whose mothers didnt take vitamins according to a report in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
the apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the 
vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy leading the 
researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid 
when they first start trying to conceive 
the defects include spina bifida in which incomplete closing of 
the bony casing around the spinal cord typically results in mild or 
severe paralysis another spinal column defect is anencephaly in 
which major parts of the brain are lacking and death usually occurs 
within hours 
such defects occur in about 4000 babies a year or 1 to 2 in 
1000 
the boston university report was based on a threeyear study of 
22776 women about half of whom took multivitamins containing 
folic acid 
the occurrence of spinal column defects was 09 per 1000 among 
babies whose mothers took the vitamins compared to 33 per 1000 
among infants born to women who didnt use supplements 
the study was conducted by dr aubrey milunsky of the center for 
human genetics at the boston university school of medicine and 
colleagues 
we believe that the combined data from this and other studies 
provide good evidence that folic acidcontaining multivitamins 
taken during the first six weeks of pregnancy will prevent spinal 
column defects the authors wrote 
the study doesnt prove folic acid prevents birth defects said 
one expert dr lewis b holmes a professor of pediatrics at 
harvard medical school 
is it the vitamin itself or are these women doing other 
things holmes asked 
discussing the implications milunsky noted most pregnant women 
see their doctors for the first time 8 to 10 weeks after conception 
almost all the fetal organs have been formed at that time 
he said an opportunity for useful intervention would have been 
lost 
the function of folic acid found naturally in liver leafy 
green vegetables mushrooms and lima and kidney beans isnt 
really known milunsky said 
studies havent ruled out the possibility that vitamins a c d 
or e alone or with folic acid protect against the defects 
since all were contained in most of the multivitamins the 
researchers noted 
the researchers also cautioned that excessive doses of 
multivitamins could be harmful 
researchers noted a strikingly higher prevalence of the 
defects 13 per 1000 among infants of women with a family 
history of spinal conditions who didnt take supplements compared 
to women with such histories who did 35 per 1000 
the study group mostly white and welleducated wasnt 
statistically representative of the population 
the frequency of spinal column defects is higher among poor 
whites and lower among blacks mulinsky said

alexander dubcek whose brand of 
socialism with a human face was crushed in the 1968 sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia is back in the limelight drawing cheers 
from hundreds of thousands of countrymen 
his public endorsement of the prodemocracy tide sweeping the 
nation follows months of increasingly outspoken criticism of the 
leadership that ousted him from the communist party 19 years ago 
working as a lowlevel employee of the state forestry services 
he remained for a long time in virtual seclusion living with his 
family in a hillside house overlooking the slovak capital of 
bratislava 
permanent police surveillance of his house was lifted after a 
1987 visit to czechoslovakia by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
whose perestroika or restructuring program largely follows the 
lines of dubceks illfated prague spring 
slowly and cautiously dubcek has prepared a return to public 
life and perhaps even to a leading role although he has kept 
silent as to his plans he celebrates his 68th birthday on monday 
his name has been chanted by hundreds of thousands of 
demonstrators in the prodemocracy rallies that began nov 17 and 
seem to have become a fixture in czechoslovakia 
the european parliament has awarded him its 1989 sakharov peace 
prize saying he symbolizes for all europeans our best hopes for 
peaceful reform in eastern europe he is expected to collect the 
prize in strasbourg france in december 
a trip to italy to receive an honorary doctorate a year ago was 
dubceks first voyage abroad since he returned from a brief spell 
as ambassador to turkey in 1970 shortly before his expulsion from 
the party along with half a million others 
milos jakes the current communist party leader oversaw those 
purges 
dubcek was barred from traveling again to italy earlier this 
year to attend the italian communist party congress where he could 
have met one of the leading soviet reformers alexander n yakovlev 
hungary made the startling move of broadcasting a lengthy 
interview with dubcek in april on staterun tv the broadcast 
prompted a formal protest from prague to its warsaw pact ally 
society is trembling in the clutches of hopelessness he 
told the partys politburo in a ninepage letter leaked to the 
media in august telling the leadership it would lose power unless 
it changed course 
do not leave the removal of deformations of the past to either 
justified pressure or chance he said anticipating growing 
demands for reforms 
in september he sided for the first time publicly with human 
rights activists in demanding the release of two dissidents accused 
of antistate activities one has since been released and the other 
was acquitted of charges against him but remains jailed pending a 
prosecution appeal 
and early this month dubceks role in the prague spring was 
given favorable footage on soviet tv included was an interview in 
which he spoke of very sad recollections about the crushing of 
the reforms 
to date moscow has not publicly disassociated itself from the 
1968 invasion saying it respects the prague leaderships view 
that the invasion was necessary however the parliaments of 
reformist hungary and poland have condemned their countrys 
participation in the invasion 
in an open letter published in this weeks moscow news 
prominent soviet writer daniil granin apologized for the invasion 
calling it illegal ruinous intervention that brought to power 
dogmatic stalinists 
czechoslovakias leading opposition group civic forum has 
asked gorbachev to explicitly brand the invasion as illegal which 
would amount to a disavowal of pragues present leaders 
a senior noncommunist czechoslovak politician said dubcek 
continues to have broad grassroots support in the party and could 
have a vital role in keeping it in power 
communists polled more than 50 percent in the last free 
elections before they seized power in a 1948 coup i would not 
bet on them losing in a new free election if dubcek was back in 
charge the politician said on condition of anonymity

the cambodian resistance and most governments involved in 
efforts to end the war say it must be resolved with a single 
package tackling all the major issues 
however thailands prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
impatient with slow progress toward an agreement has said the 
combatants first could agree to a truce and international 
verification of a vietnamese troop pullout 
he said they could then take on more vexing issues such as 
powersharing 
along with china thailand is the main backer of a guerrilla 
coalition fighting the government vietnam installed in cambodia 
with an invasion 11 years ago 
the cambodian issue must be solved and in order to advance 
toward a comprehensive solution we could and we should move 
step by step to settle the problem radio hanoi today quoted 
deputy premier bhichai rattakul as saying 
bhichai spoke thursday at a news conference at the end of a 
threeday official visit to hanoi vietnams capital with other 
senior government officials and businessmen 
according to radio hanoi monitored in bangkok bhichai said 
informal peace talks being organized by indonesia should be held as 
soon as possible indonesias foreign minister ali alatas said 
thursday that could happen by february 
indonesia is among the nations that have called for a 
comprehensive solution the new talks cochaired by france 
represent an attempt to resume the dialogue after a month of failed 
international talks in paris in august 
those talks collapsed over the cambodian governments refusal to 
share power with the communist khmer rouge which killed hundreds 
of thousands of people in the 1970s before it was ousted by 
vietnams invading forces the khmer rouge now has the strongest 
army of a threefaction resistance coalition

us and japanese scientists are flying over 
the pacific ocean in a dc8 jet and firing laser beams through the 
atmosphere part of a project that may double the accuracy of 
weather forecasts officials said today 
scientists are using the laser to measure atmospheric wind 
patterns they hope to use the measurements to design a satellite 
equipped with a similar laser that will be able to measure wind 
flows throughout the world said john theon of the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
we believe that if we can measure winds all over the globe we 
can double the accuracy of weather forecasts he said this 
will be a breakthrough in our ability to understand weather and how 
it works 
the nasa plane uses lasers to shoot out pulses of light that are 
reflected back by dust pollen and water particles carried by the 
atmospheric winds the delay and frequency change of the 
reflections are used to calculate the wind flows in a 9mile 
crosssection of the atmosphere 
information from the planes measurements will be combined with 
data from nine japanese landbased stations also using lasers to 
measure atmosphere winds toshikazu itabe of the japanese ministry 
of posts and telecommunications told reporters here at the us 
yokota air base 
improved knowledge of air flows also is expected to give 
scientists a better understanding of how heat and moisture are 
transmitted through the atmosphere theon said that should improve 
the accuracy of predictions of rising global temperatures linked to 
pollutants in the atmosphere that trap the earths heat called the 
greenhouse effect 
scientists have predicted that the earths average temperature 
may rise from 3 degrees to 6 degrees f over the next 40 years if 
the amount of such pollutants in the atmosphere continue to rise at 
current rates 
such changes could cause major climatic changes including a 
partial melting of the polar ice caps that might flood coastal 
areas and entire island nations 
the big remaining question regarding climate is the effect of 
clouds said james spinhirne a nasa scientist on board the 
plane in current climatic models temperatures could fluctuate as 
much as 3555 degrees depending on the effect of clouds on 
temperature flows 
the laser technique he said allows much more accurate mapping 
of cloud patterns and movements than previous measurement methods 
itabe said negotiations are underway between japans science and 
technology agency and nasa on cooperation in building the satellite 
system 
nasa hopes to launch the satellite by the late 1990s theon said

a new drug derived from a chinese tree has 
triggered remissions of colon cancer in laboratory mice doctors 
said in a preliminary report 
in 20 years in this lab weve never seen anything like this 
we have animals that are tumorfree said dr john stehlin 
scientific director at the stehlin foundation for cancer research 
at houstons st joseph hospital 
during two years of experiments researchers said they treated 
about 100 mice with three kinds of human colon cancer slow 
medium and fastgrowing once the mice began developing tumors 
they were divided into two groups those receiving the new drug 
9amino camptothecin or 9ac and those receiving no treatment 
most mice showed no trace of residual cancer after being treated 
with 9ac for several months doctors said the untreated mice died 
some mice treated with 9ac are still alive after surviving the 
equivalent in human terms of 20 years stehlin said at a briefing 
this week 
the findings were published today in the journal science 
this is a preliminary report he said obviously more 
work needs to be done with additional colon cancers and other forms 
of cancer that are not responsive to the standard anticancer 
agents 
colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the united 
states with 147000 new cases reported each year the disease most 
commonly treated by surgery takes about 60000 lives annually 
beppino giovanella director of the st joseph hospital 
laboratory for cancer research said all three tumors used in the 
experiments had not responded to major known anticancer drugs 
administered at maximum tolerable doses 
giovanella also said two mice injected with lung cancer have 
shown a regression of their cancer after being treated with 9ac 
very little progress has been made in colon cancer treatment in 
the past 40 years stehlin said chemotherapy and immunotherapy 
have had little effect and the use of the drug levamisole with 
5fluorouracil improves the survival rate in about 15 percent of 
patients he said 
researchers said mice with the slowgrowing cancer responded to 
9ac within 10 days and by 20 days were tumorfree 
the mice with the mediumgrowing cancer took about 10 days to 
start reacting and in about 25 days were in remission according to 
researchers mice treated with the fastgrowing cancer took 21 days 
before responding to 9ac 
the 9ac drug is a derivative of camptothecin an alkaloid 
extracted from a chinese tree dr monroe wall of the research 
triangle institute in north carolina isolated camptothecin in the 
1960s 
it was tested on humans but was soon discarded because of its 
excessive toxicity researchers are hoping to find out whether 9ac 
is as toxic as its parent if approved by the food and drug 
administration the researchers could start tests on humans as 
early as next year 
doctors at johns hopkins school of medicine in baltimore have 
identified camptothecin as a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase i 
an enzyme present in animal cells which controls cell division 
studies at new york university say cancerous colons usually have 
more topoisomerase i than normal colons

high up the 220foot harkness tower 
overlooking the yale campus workmen are hoping to put the ring 
back in one of the countrys largest carillons in time for 
christmas 
the yale memorial carillon has been quiet since july when 
dozens of bronze clappers some weighing as much as 300 pounds 
were removed and taken away for refurbishing 
the repairs will give the 54 bells that make up the carillon a 
crisper clearer tone 
two intrepid workers from the verdin co of cincinnati returned 
to the tower this month to begin replacing the restored clappers 
and reconnect them to a clavier two levels below they hope to be 
finished by middecember 
the guild of university carillonneurs a student organization 
is responsible for playing the bells daily at noon and 530 pm 
harkness tower a medievallooking stone building topped by 
turrets and pinnacles was dedicated in 1922 with a chime 
consisting of 10 bells part of the gift honoring the memory of 
charles william harkness a member of the yale class of 1883 the 
bells were cast by a firm of bellfounders in loughborough england 
which traces its history back to the 14th century

a scientist emerged after spending three 
weeks alone in a sealed selfcontained world hungry for 
companionship and thanksgiving turkey 
biologist linda leigh ended the 21day test thursday emerging 
after her recordbreaking stay inside a sealed greenhouselike 
module that generates its own food air and water the device is 
part of a program to explore technologies for replicating earths 
environment in space 
ms leigh 39 emerged from the airtight glassandsteel module 
just in time for thanksgiving dinner and was hugged by abigail 
alling director of the projects marine ecological system 
she was quite struck by the beauty of the system ms alling 
said in a telephone interiew 
wearing a bright red jumpsuit ms leigh was greeted by 
coworkers friends and reporters but wasnt allowed to speak 
before being whisked away for a medical exam like an astronaut back 
from space 
ms leigh entered the module nov 2 for the longestever stay 
inside an ecosystem entirely independent of earths breaking ms 
allings mark of five days 
the structure is a test for biosphere ii a 30 million module 
under construction on a ranch about 30 miles north of tucson next 
september four men and four women will enter the much larger 
module for two years to determine whether humans can duplicate 
earths life systems for use in space 
inside the sealed system everything is recycled air water 
and waste material and the occupants also produce all their own 
food 
extensive medical monitoring while she was inside found the 
confinement didnt seem to harm ms leighs health doctors said 
the one thing that i really do miss is just companionship 
ms leigh said wednesday by telephone other than that im quite 
content on the inside i feel like i could stay in here 
indefinitely 
ms leighs meals averaging about 2000 calories a day 
included such modulegrown foods as sweet potatoes kohlrabi 
jalapeno peppers and tangerines she also had a tank of tilapia 
fish 
water for drinking cooking and showering was removed from the 
air all waste water was fed into a marsh recycling system 
the botanist had to repair the loose belt of a large fan that 
heats and cools the module and had to finetune the irrigation 
system 
the project is being undertaken by space biospheres ventures a 
company funded largely by texas oilman edward p bass

an unmanned barge carrying 5 million 
gallons of jet fuel was snared and towed to a harbor after it 
drifted for more than a day near the site of the exxon valdez oil 
spill the coast guard said 
it had about 12 hours remaining until it would have hit one of 
the reefs or islands at the entrance to prince william sound 
said coast guard lt daniel bobalek in juneau 
the 400foot barge was towed to port etches on hinchenbrook 
island thursday night said coast guard lt brian flory 
workers there made hookup adjustments necessary for the barge 
to be towed 360 miles to anchorage 
prince william sound about 20 miles north of the area where the 
barge went adrift was where the tanker exxon valdez hit a reef 
march 24 and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in the 
worst spill in us history 
the barge owned by crowley maritime corp of seattle broke 
loose from a tug in stormtossed seas tuesday afternoon 20 miles 
south of cape st elias in the gulf of alaska a tug skipper 
reported the incident to the coast guard in valdez guard spokesman 
ed moreth said 
the crew of a coast guard plane spotted the barge wednesday and 
a radio buoy with a strobe light was dropped to the vessel by 
helicopter spokesman ted french said by early thursday the tug 
that reported the incident had the barge on a towline french said 
coast guard officials had yet to determine why the barge broke 
loose 
officials had considered summoning an army ordnance team to blow 
up the barge and burn off the fuel before the vessel could run 
aground and spill its cargo 
this episode was too close for comfort but we are relieved 
that it had a happy ending said bill lamoreaux an 
anchoragebased supervisor for the alaska department of 
environmental conservation 
bobalek said it was hard to determine how much damage the fuel 
would have caused if the barges 20 cargo tanks had ruptured

free food for the needy was the ransom 
agreed to by the southern california grocers association to reclaim 
hundreds of abandoned shopping carts held hostage by the city 
the city council passed an ordinance about a year ago allowing 
its crews to impound shopping carts left on streets and sidewalks 
in glendale just north of los angeles the city would return the 
carts worth up to 100 each only after stores paid a 15 fee 
the city had collected about 800 abandoned shopping carts the 
two biggest supermarket chains affected ralphs and vons would 
have had to come up with about 4000 each to get theirs back 
with the city running out of storage space councilman larry 
zarian suggested the stores donate food to glendales charitable 
organizations in exchange for an exemption from the impound fees 
as long as we are giving them back their carts they need to 
do something for this community zarian said its appropriate 
during this holiday season to give to the poor and needy 
association president steven koff said details of the food 
donation plan have not been worked out

an editorial on staterun 
radio today indicated the government may soon lift some of the 
emergency press restrictions in effect for more than three years 
on thursday president fw de klerk said officials in boksburg 
must allow people of all races to own businesses rightwing whites 
have tried to maintain strict segregation in the city 
the editorial broadcast on governmentrun radio south africa 
said the lifting of media restrictions that are no longer 
relevant in todays relaxed political climate will promote a more 
open public debate on crucial national issues 
it said the move would also help promote more comprehensive 
and fruitful negotiations on the countrys political and 
constitutional makeup 
the restrictions have been in place since june 12 1986 they 
cover photographing reporting or broadcasting political unrest 
police action statements the government considers subversive 
details about people detained without trial and information about 
boycotts 
under the rules dozens of journalists have been arrested for 
being at the scene of news events several newspapers have been 
closed temporarily and one the new nation is currently under 
threat of immediate closure 
todays editorial gave no date for when the rules would be 
removed 
reacting to the presidents decision on boksburg the 
conservative party called his proclamation an attempt to destroy 
white community life 
boksburg 12 miles east of johannesburg has attracted worldwide 
attention since members of the farright conservative party won 
control of the city council last year 
local lawmakers in the past year have reimposed rigid apartheid 
policies aside from the ownership ban that were lifted when the 
national party controlled the city these include resegregating 
public toilets the park the library and a sports complex 
blacks who outnumber the citys 50000 whites responded with a 
boycott of whiteowned businesses and have been using public 
facilities in defiance of the council 
blacks called off the yearold business boycott last week after 
de klerk called for repeal of the separate amenities act a 
national law that allows segregation of many public facilities 
housing schools and hospitals are not covered by the act and will 
remain segregated nationwide 
weve succeeded in bringing boksburg to the attention of 
people everywhere said henry jeffreys secretary of the 
antiapartheid save boksburg committee after de klerks 
proclamation the government had no choice but to act 
the national government has the authority to overrule 
municipalities on some issues including the question of whether 
blacks can own businesses in downtown areas 
de klerks proclamation which allows a person of any race to 
operate a business in boksburg is partly symbolic jeffreys said 
black businessmen probably will keep their shops in the black 
townships he said however there are indian shopkeepers in 
boksburgs downtown business district who no longer face eviction 
because of race he said 
the indians have generally used whites to serve as front men to 
obtain necessary licenses 
the national party to which de klerk belongs was responsible 
for the boksburg law restricting business ownership to whites the 
conservatives kept the policy when they took over last year 
the government sincerely hopes that the negative image 
attributed to boksburg both locally and abroad is now 
something of the past the minister of planning and provincial 
affairs hernus kriel said in announcing de klerks proclamation 
de klerks proclamation is the latest in a series of gestures to 
the disenfranchised black majority which still has no vote in 
national affairs the government has been allowing peaceful 
antiapatheid gatherings and last month freed several jailed 
activists from prison

the teacher of the year in this citys public 
schools got a plaque a handshake and a new job as teachers 
ombudsman a liaison between the administration and her 
colleagues in the classroom 
in what school officials say is believed to be the first program 
of its kind in the nation the citys most honored teacher is being 
asked to spend the following year representing teachers concerns 
before the superintendent 
you could call me the morale officer for the school system 
said deborah battle a vocational education teacher from carver 
high school the first ombudsman she was atlantas teacher of the 
year for 198889 
superintendent jerome harris said the ombudsman is a winwin 
situation 
it provides me with an additional communication vehicle to the 
teachers harris said it gives some type of reward to the 
teacher of the year by allowing her to interact with the system 
and shes been able to help us maneuver more with the grassroots 
people 
ms battles duties have ranged from helping mediate disputes 
between teachers to solving payroll problems and answering 
questions about retirement and sick leave 
i even had a parent who came in last week she said she 
was having a problem with her child and a teacher and she didnt 
know where to turn 
ms battle is also working on organizing the teacher of the year 
nominees from each school to work on developing ideas to improve 
classroom performance 
these people were chosen by their faculties as their most 
outstanding teacher she said what better way to have them 
provide professional leadership 
ms battle 38 said that she was ready to try something 
different after 11 years of teaching and likes her new post so 
much that she would consider staying on the administrative side 
im weighing my options she said i really am enjoying 
it its a very important job because the longer i do this 
the more ive found that on so many boards and groups of people 
making decisions concerning education about education im the only 
teacher im the only person there who can speak for teachers as 
to how somethings going to be received by the children 
it just amazed me that all these decisions are made what we 
do and how we do it and teachers are never there

authorities found a bomb today outside the home 
of a doctor who transplanted the heart of a slain israeli soldier 
into a palestinian police said an underground jewish group said 
it placed the device 
police found a similar crude bomb at the home of a professor who 
invited a palestinian activist to speak at hebrew university in 
jerusalem police spokesman uzi sandori said 
an anonymous caller telephoned the israeli dailies yediot 
ahronot and maariv early today and claimed a group called the 
sicarites placed the bombs at the two homes 
if they do not leave the country within a week we will wait 
for them in a dark corner with a machine gun maariv quoted the 
caller as saying 
the sicarites named after first century jewish zealots who 
battled the romans have claimed responsibility for at least nine 
attacks on arabs and liberal jews including the machine gun 
slaying of an arab outside jerusalems old city on april 10 
no arrests were ever made in that slaying and sandori said no 
suspects have been detained in connection with the bombs found 
today 
sandori descibed the device found outside the west jerusalem 
home of dr dov shimon as a glass seltzer bottle rigged with 
gunpowder and a candle he said the candle was apparently meant to 
set off an explosion but both devices were found before exploding 
the other bomb was found outside the home of yoram ben porat 
who invited palestinian activist feisal husseni to speak at hebrew 
university last week 
shimon one of two surgeons who performed the heart transplant 
on the soldier slain by palestinian attackers said it was not the 
first time he has been threatened since the nov 15 operation 
there have been anonymous phone calls to my wife that i was 
hurt for example and was hospitalized but i was at home at the 
time he told army radio 
i am astonished there are people in israel who cannot separate 
medicine from politics he said 
the heart was removed from sgt zeev traum 40 who died of head 
wounds suffered in an ambush by arab guerrillas in the occupied 
gaza strip it was transplanted into hanna khader 54 a former 
hotel manager from arab east jerusalem 
hadassah hospital spokeswoman ruth mekel said today that khader 
was in good condition 
his wife mary said her husband could speak and also walk with 
some help but cannot yet eat solid food 
she said she could not understand why some jews were angry about 
the transplant 
they previously received organs from arabs so why are they 
making this a problem she said in a telephone interview 
doctors said khader was chosen for the operation over dozens of 
other jews and arabs on a transplant waiting list because traums 
tissue most closely matched his 
news of the transplant was leaked to the press sparking angry 
reactions from rightwing israeli groups some palestinians have 
accused authorities of leaking the news to gain favorable publicity 
for israel

china today protested us legislation that would 
make it easier for chinese students to extend their visits to the 
united states if they are worried about persecution at home 
vice foreign minister liu huaqiu lodged the protest in a meeting 
with lynn pascoe acting charge daffaires of the us embassy the 
official xinhua news agency said 
on thursday foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said the 
bill passed by both houses of congress broke existing agreements 
on student exchanges and contributed to the deterioration of 
chineseus relations 
jin said the bill was unacceptable and that china would 
make some due response he did not elaborate 
the bill would allow the more than 30000 chinese students in 
the united states who hold exchange visitor visas visas to apply 
for a change in visa status within four years 
currently holders of such visas must return home for at least 
two years before applying for a different visa 
the legislation is meant to protect the thousands of chinese 
students in the united states who participated in demonstrations or 
voiced support for the repressed prodemocracy movement in china 
last spring 
the bill must now go to president bush who has not said if he 
will sign it 
the chinese government has vowed there will be no reprisals 
against the students however many of the students say they are 
worried they will face punishment or even imprisonment upon their 
return 
the foreign ministry on sunday also protested congressional 
moves to extend economic sanctions against china 
the crackdown has strained chineseus ties more than at any 
time since diplomatic relations were established in 1979

tearful and silent the mothers of 
two soviet soldiers captured by anticommunist guerrillas in 
afghanistan arrived today to claim sons they havent seen for more 
than two years 
pvts andrei lopukh and valery prokapchuk both 20 will be the 
first soviet prisoners of war released since the red army ended 
nine years of involvement in afghanistans civil war in february 
officials said 
soviet diplomats said both were captured in 1987 but afghan 
rebels earlier claimed lopukh had deserted to their side 
they will be released within days under arrangements nearly 
completed among afghan rebels pakistans foreign ministry and the 
international committee of the red cross the diplomats said 
maria lopukh of byelorussia and valentina prokapchuk of the 
ukraine wept as they arrived by chartered aeroflot jet with a 
fivemember delegation including parents of other soldiers missing 
in afghanistan 
they declined to speak with reporters 
these are two very simple plain russian women suffering 
women who thought they had lost their sons said iona andronov 
spokesman of nadezhka hope a private group that works for the 
release of soviet pows but they soon will become the happiest 
women in the world 
soviet diplomats called the release a goodwill gesture by 
the rebels called mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors who for 
11 years have fought to topple successive sovietbacked 
governments in kabul 
the diplomats refused to describe it as a prisoner exchange but 
hinted that moscow was prepared to help lobby for the release of 
some rebel prisoners held by afghan communists 
this is completely a humanitarian issue but if you are doing 
something good for the russian people something will happen 
andronov said 
moscow claims about 310 of its men are unaccounted for in 
afghanistan the rebels say they are holding no more than 75 
the insurgents backed primarily by pakistan and the united 
states claim the kabul government is holding as many as 35000 
rebel prisoners many in the notorious pulicharki prison complex 
outside the afghan capital 
the insurgents offered to release lopukh when andronov brought a 
delegation to the pakistani frontier city of peshawar in june 
however the former soldier told a news conference he wouldnt 
go home until kabul freed all rebel prisoners he said he had 
become a moslem and was unsure if he wanted to go home 
soviet forces fought to prop up afghanistans marxists who 
seized power in a 1978 coup between december 1979 and february 
1989 moscow continues massive military aid to kabul 
government forces still control the countrys major cities but 
the rebels have virtual free run of the countryside the insurgents 
refuse to talk peace with kabul officials whom they blame for 
inviting the soviet intervention

a moslem leader in britain said today he plans a 
lecture tour of the middle east including iran in a campaign to 
persuade that nations leaders to revoke their death threat against 
author salman rushdie 
a price on his head is below the dignity of the iranian 
government it belongs to gangster movies and westerns said dr 
hesham elessawy chairman of the islamic society for the promotion 
of religious tolerance 
he said he plans to speak at universities and to the media in 
egypt and the persian gulf states in february if the iranian 
government guarantees his safety he said he will visit there as 
well 
rushdies novel the satanic verses has offended many moslems 
worldwide who say it blasphemes islam 
on feb 14 ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the iranian leader who 
died in june told moslems to kill the author khomeinis threat 
was backed by the offer of a 52 million bounty by two iranian 
moslem clergymen 
the 42yearold writer an indianborn briton remains in hiding 
elessawy a london dentist said he would cite the koran 
islams holy book to support his arguments that the death threat 
should be lifted 
the koran has verses that actually fit the situation exactly 
if unbelievers or hypocrites mock or insult the word of god do not 
sit with them until they talk about something else he said 
the korans position is very tolerant but khomeini said kill 
him elessawy said i am just as incensed by mr rushdies 
book as anybody else but my reaction has to come within the 
confines and teachings of the koran i am hoping that people will 
come to their senses and the pressure will ease 
the london newspaper the independent today quoted elessawy as 
saying the rushdie affair had harmed britains 2 million moslems by 
encouraging a backlash against them on march 17 iran broke 
diplomatic ties with britain over the rushdie affair

severe drought in warwracked northern 
ethiopia may threaten as many as 4 million people with starvation 
more than twice the number originally feared to be in danger a 
united nations official said today 
the new estimate was based on satellite pictures that revealed 
widespread crop failures in the northernmost provinces of eritrea 
tigre and wollo said david morton the un world food program 
representative in ethiopia 
up to 600000 metric tons of relief food could be needed next 
year to avert widespread famine deaths like those suffered in the 
198485 famine when up to 1 million people died he said 
the new figures are substantially higher than those released in 
october when the united nations appealed for 240000 tons of food 
to feed 18 million people based on satellite photographs that 
indicated only eritreas crops had been severely affected by failed 
rains only about 40 inches of rain fell this year half the 
normal amount 
morton said the response to the october appeal was good and 
fast and that 130000 tons of food already had been pledged but 
that now would satisfy only about onefifth of northern ethiopias 
needs 
about half the people threatened by starvation live behind rebel 
lines and morton would not comment on how relief agencies would 
get the emergency food aid to them it also was unknown whether 
ethiopias marxist government would allow shipments of 
international aid from its seaports into rebelheld areas 
on thursday ethiopian and eritrean rebel peace negotiators sat 
down to a traditional american thanksgiving dinner with former 
president jimmy carter and his wife in nairobi kenya the 
negotiators settled procedural issues leading to further talks 
aimed at ending their 28yearold civil war

east german leader egon krenz said in an 
interview published today that he favors abolishing the communist 
partys constitutional claim to total power making yet another 
concession to the prodemocracy movement 
but while explicitly advocating the removal of the 
constitutional provision guaranteeing the party a monopoly on 
power he made it clear he expects the party to remain a leading 
force 
in other developments today west german officials reported a 
sharp rise in east german requests for permanent resettlement 
there in the past 24 hours 2000 such requests were received 
compared to 865 in the 24hour period before that they said 
leaders of the governmentrun labor union requested an 
investigation of harry tisch an ousted politburo member and the 
former government labor chief whom they accused of abuse of power 
on thursday the communist party announced it had opened a probe 
of ousted leader erich honecker 
krenz a former honecker disciple now trying to distance himself 
from his old mentor said in a television interview thursday that 
he would step down if the party asked to leave during a party 
congress next month 
the party thursday also revoked the membership of honeckers 
former economic czar who was thrown out of the ruling politburo in 
the purge last month that launched a wave of reform and opened up 
the berlin wall 
the moves reflected the partys desperate attempts to restore 
its sinking credibility and authority 
meanwhile prodemocracy demonstrations continued with about 
10000 protesters rallying in the city of erfurt on thursday night 
said east germanys adn news agency 
in an interview published today by the communist party daily 
neues deutschland krenz called for major constitutional changes to 
separate the party state and economy 
asked by the interviewer about the countrys deep political 
crisis krenz mentioned the constitutional provision guaranteeing 
communist authority and said we are in favor of abolishing it 
that is one of protesters main demands 
but when asked about demands by prodemocracy demonstrators for 
curbing party interference in all aspects of life krenz 
replied one has to say very clearly that we will interfere with 
all our energy not least because we represent a considerable part 
of the population particularly the working class 
he added we are not a corrupt party 
krenz said hardline policies of the past decades caused many 
basic mistakes ultimately the crisis of our society 
the disciplinary investigation against the ailing honecker 
former economy czar guenter mittag and two other former officials 
was based on grave abuses of the party statute and 
responsibility for the current situation in the party and the 
country adn said without elaborating thursday 
adn also said that mittag was expelled from the party 
the partys probe of honecker and other former senior officials 
could result in various sanctions ranging from an official rebuke 
to expulsion from the party 
krenz replaced honecker on oct 18 honecker led the country for 
18 years staunchly resisting the kind of reforms launched by 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev nearly five years ago 
krenz has embraced a program of reforms and concessions to 
opposition demands including the longdenied freedom to travel 
the promise of free elections and sweeping changes in the economy 
but the dramatic changes have failed to shore up the partys 
standing and krenzs own credibility among the citizenry which has 
staged massive demonstrations to press demands for more democracy 
krenz 52 long viewed as a hardliner said in an interview 
with west germanys ard television network thursday that he had 
been inspired by the new thinking of gorbachev he said 1985 
when gorbachev came to power was decisive for him 
krenz also said he had talked several times to honecker by 
telephone and that the former leader accepts that he is largely 
responsible for this situation 
that was a reference to the political and economic crisis that 
led nearly 300000 east germans to leave the country this year and 
sparked massive prodemocracy demonstrations nationwide 
east german officials already have said a parliamentary 
commission was looking into charges of misuse of power and 
corruption against honecker and his inner circle 
adn said doctors had decided that honecker was too ill to make 
any statements in the proceedings the 77yearold former leader 
has had severe medical problems since a gall bladder operation 
earlier this year 
krenz said he hadnt taken over as leader for a shortterm 
period but emphasized that a decision on his fate was up to next 
months special party congress and that he would step down if 
asked 
earlier east germany announced a package of measures aimed at 
stopping the massive smuggling of currency and consumer goods out 
of the troubled nation 
since east germany lifted travel restrictions on nov 9 the 
communist government has been wrestling with a growing black market 
and smuggling on a scale not seen since before the berlin wall was 
built in 1961

three shots were fired today at a 
polling booth where opposition leader vishwanath pratap singh had 
gone to investigate reports of election fraud singh and witnesses 
said 
no one was hurt and it was not known who fired the shots 
singh refused to say if he thought the shots were aimed at him 
but one witness said it was very close it was obvious that the 
target of the gunmen was raja sahib 
singh is often called raja sahib which means king sir 
shots rang out as singh got out of his car in the village of 
dubrai in uttar pradesh state where he had gone to investigate 
reports that workers from prime minister rajiv gandhis congress 
party were rigging polls 
the witness who is not affiliated with singhs opposition 
coalition said the gunfire began as singh was surrounded by a 
crowd of people who had alleged the ballotfixing the witness 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
another person at the scene also reported the shooting but said 
he could not tell if the shots were aimed at singh 
anand sharma chief spokesman for the congress party was asked 
in new delhi about the shooting he replied that opposition 
supporters were responsible for all the violence in the area 
today was the second of three days of voting in a parliamentary 
election in which gandhi faces the most determined challenge ever 
mounted by the countrys usually splintered opposition 
singhs janata dal party and the congress party have traded 
charges of widespread fraud and intimidation and electionrelated 
violence has killed at least 106 people 
the election commission said today it has ordered a revote at 
930 of the countrys 590000 voting booths following fraud reports 
in comments earlier today 58yearold singh said the 
congress is bent upon creating trouble here but i am not going to 
allow that in his wake villagers armed with batons and spears 
screamed death to the congress and vowed to protect voters 
from troublemakers 
gandhi headed to punjab state which votes sunday for a last 
campaign swing 
at a rally in bhatinda he accused neighboring pakistan of 
arming and training sikh separatists who have killed about 1640 
people this year in their fight for a separate nation in punjab 
pakistan has denied such allegations 
in the first hours of voting today clashes between congress 
party and janata dal supporters were reported in calcutta and 
eastern orissa state but there were no immediate reports of deaths 
a total of 106 people have been killed in campaignrelated 
violence since oct 17 when elections were announced since voting 
began wednesday 62 people have died 
at stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the lok 
sabha or house of the people parliaments policymaking lower 
house no results will be announced until after the last polls 
close sunday 
few real issues were at stake in the campaign apart from gandhi 
himself who has been dogged for half of his fiveyear term by 
allegations of corruption in high government circles 
the national front an opposition coalition spearheaded by 
singhs janata dal party has promised to provide clean government 
but gandhi told voters the only party capable of governing is 
his congress party whose most famous leaders were his grandfather 
and mother prime minister jawaharlal nehru and prime minister 
indira gandhi 
gandhi was swept into office on a wave of sympathy after his 
mothers assassination in 1984 winning 415 of parliaments 543 
seats however recent polls indicated he could lose the election 
or be forced into an unwieldy coalition with smaller parties this 
time 
the congress party has governed india for all but 29 months 
since the country became independent 42 years ago 
voting today was spread across 10 states and two federally 
governed territories where a total of 264 million people were 
eligible to vote 
the total number of eligible voters is 498 million most of the 
rest of indias 25 states and seven territories voted wednesday on 
sunday voting will take place in three states 
elections for the 14 seats in northeastern assam state have been 
postponed indefinitely because of incomplete voter rolls and a few 
other contests were delayed because of candidates deaths

secondlargest apple producer after washington 
its also more expensive and takes longer to grow but apple 
growers say the fuji may be the apple of tomorrow 
in the future flavor and crispness will be more important 
than red shiny apples said roger kroph a major growerpacker 
in the grand rapids area were in a world market now and the 
europeans have always chosen taste over looks 
the japanese variety is beginning to appear on supermarket 
shelves and analysts predict a healthy market for the fuji 
it stays crisp and juicy in storage long after other apples 
have turned mushy said jerome hull a pomologist or orchard 
scientist at michigan state university that means big 
supermarket orders 
growing the fuji in michigan would mean developing a new strain 
hull said its six to sevenmonth growing season is two months 
longer than the states season 
california growers are entering the apple market for the first 
time simply to grow the fuji their counterparts in washington 
plan a major shift toward the fuji after overproduction of red 
delicious depressed the value of the crop there 
the new breed of apple doesnt exactly spell disaster michigan 
growers said 
chrysler survived honda just took a piece of the market 
said kroph the fuji will be just another variety and it will be 
a long time coming it takes 10 years to put a tree into 
production 
michigan grows eight varieties of apples and produces more than 
1 billion pounds a year the fuji sells for about 99 cents a pound 
in the detroit area compared with 59 cents a pound for michigan 
and washington red delicious apples

quebec and locked prisoners in their cells a spokesman for the 
guards union said today 
city and provincial police surrounded some of the facilities and 
have threatened to go in and remove the guards spokesman pierre 
valiquette said 
fortyfive guards occupied the command center of parthenais on 
thursday after officials fired pierre gaummound head of the union 
at montreals parthenais detention center valiquette said 
essential services including food and medical services will be 
provided but until gaummound is rehired management staff will be 
kept out and prisoners will remain in their cells valiquette said 
they tried to kill the union by cutting off its head he 
said 
contract negoiations with the provinces 1500 guards broke down 
two months ago valiquette said adding that the guards have been 
without a contract since january 1988 
eleven prisoners have been locked out of parthenais and may have 
to be sent home said one who identified himself only as a

communist party chief nicolae 
ceausescu who has staunchly opposed the democratic reforms 
sweeping the rest of eastern europe was reelected to another 
fiveyear term today 
the partys 467member central committee unanimously chose 
ceausescu the only candidate delegates to the 14th communist 
party congress greeted the selection with cries of ceausescu 
cpr the abbreviation for the party 
delegates also approved an economic and social program for the 
next five years and beyond that would further strengthen the 
partys neartotal control over the daily lives of romanians no 
details of the plan were given 
ceausescu 71 also called for the annulment of the 1939 
sovietnazi germany treaty that agreed to the partition of much of 
eastern europe among the powers the official news agency agerpres 
reported today 
in talks with communist delegations he said the treaty should 
be considered wrong and officially annuled with all its 
provisions including its secret provisions one provision ceded 
the romanian province of bessarabia to the soviet union and gave 
moscow control over the three baltic states 
the talks elaborated on comments he made monday when he 
indirectly appeared to urge the return of bessarabia which is now 
soviet moldavia but he has made no specific demand to moscow for 
the return of the territory 
ceausescu also proposed an international conference of communist 
and socialist parties to discuss the many problems of 
socialist construction agerpres reported 
as he spoke in the downtown palace hall thousands of workers 
and youths gathered outside shouting proceausescu slogans state 
radio said 125000 people turned out it was not possible to 
confirm the figure independently 
ceausescu the longestserving party leader in eastern europe 
has so far rejected reforms similar to those that have gripped 
other soviet bloc countries and have most recently shaken 
czechoslovakia 
his intolerance of any opposition had led to the most repressive 
atmosphere within the soviet bloc even before the onset of changes 
elsewhere 
his insistence on prompt repayment of a 23 billion foreign debt 
brought on a harsh austerity movement that caused shortages of food 
and many consumer goods his governments program of razing ethnic 
hungarian villages has led to his condemnation by human rights 
groups 
however the fiveday party congress which ends today has been 
filled with speeches lauding his efforts and calling him a hero 
of the nation 
officials said earlier that the reelection of the man who has 
led rmania since 1965 would be a formality because there is 
nobody foolish enough to oppose him 
ceausescu indicated that at his international conference he 
would like to form an alliance of orthodox communists to 
counterbalance the reform wave gripping all six other warsaw pact 
nations 
we must not necessarily wait until every party is ready to 
attend ceausescu was quoted as saying the parties that wish 
to meet and discuss the problems of strengthening their solidarity 
and collaboration in the fight against imperialism must meet 
ceausescu said the annulment of the 1939 nazisoviet pact 
should be done for the past and present and for the future 
alike he said it was important as a lesson for the present and 
the future 
the world issues including the nuclear issues cannot be 
settled by the two powers alone he said 
he also warned the world to beware today too of a possible 
new accord between the us and the soviet union to the detriment 
of other peoples

the government rejected an american reporters 
application to work in this islandrepublic and denied permission 
to a second journalist seeking to extend his employment pass 
no reason was given for the decisions and officials refused to 
elaborate today both reporters work for the apdow jones news 
service 
the employment pass required by foreigners employed in 
singapore was denied matthew k geiger a us citizen who was to 
have been assigned from new york 
a letter signed on behalf of the controller of information 
dated nov 18 and received thursday by apdow jones in singapore 
said i regret that the application is not approved 
geiger applied for the pass on sept 28 to replace simon elegant 
as regional correspondent for the financial news service 
elegants request for a twomonth extension of his employment 
pass was denied in october and he left singapore after being based 
here three years 
we are puzzled by this action and will be seeking further 
information about why it was taken apdow jones managing editor 
james furlong said in new york 
apdow jones is jointly owned by the associated press and dow 
jones and co dow jones also is majority owner of the asian wall 
street journal and sole owner of the far eastern economic review 
singapore has refused to let the asian journal base a reporter 
in the country since mid1988 and has refused to let the review 
base a reporter here since mid1987 
since february 1987 singapore has restricted circulation of the 
asian journal to 400 copies a day from about 5000 previously 
the reviews circulation was restricted to 500 copies a week in 
december 1987 down from about 9000 
both hong kongbased organizations had their circulations 
slashed under a 1986 amendment to the newspapers and printing 
presses act that enables the government to restrict the sale and 
distribution of a publication that is deemed to be engaging in 
domestic politics 
both denied that any articles appearing in their pages 
constituted such interference

hightech electronic locks on newer model cars make them even 
harder to break into 
even manual locks have changed and arent easy to unlock

we dont like to deal with the liability and the damage he 
said 
drivers on the outside looking in at their keys will be referred

was the second former officer to make the allegation 
also today a newspaper said the police major eugene de kock 
has been called to testify at two inquests involving the deaths of 
eight activists 
law and order minister adriaan vlok suggested today that the 
allegation of the death squad is part of a plot by black militants 
to discredit the police 
butana nofomela and david tshikalange who have said they were 
members of a police death squad alleged that de kock commanded the 
squad from 1983 and was linked to the killings of activists 
the name of maj eugene de kock has increasingly emerged as 
the new leader of the polices alleged murder gang said free 
weekly an antiapartheid afrikaanslanguage newspaper 
free weekly today quoted tshikalange as saying de kock was the 
field commander of the death squad tshikalange said that in 1983 
he saw the body of a slain man wrapped in plastic and with blood 
on the head in the trunk of de kocks car 
nofomela who is on death row for a killing unrelated to the 
alleged death squad activities said in an affidavit made public 
earlier that he saw de kock shoot security guard japie moponye in 
the head in 1985 moponye was the brother of a suspected african 
national congress guerrilla 
nofomela tshikalange and a third expoliceman former capt 
dirk coetzee have admitted taking part in numerous killings of 
antiapartheid activists in south africa and in neighboring 
countries 
coetzee said he headed an antiterrorist unit that he said acted 
as a death squad until 1982 de kock took over the same 
antiterrorist unit in 1983 free weekly and weekly mail reported 
today 
tshikalange and coetzee have fled south africa nofomela has 
been granted a stay of execution while the allegations are 
investigated 
police have denied the existence of an authorized death squad 
but say it is possible that renegade officers killed government 
opponents on their own 
president fw de klerk has not commented on the case and is not 
expected to do so until he reviews a report by vlok 
vlok said the african national congress and the south african 
communist party both outlawed are attempting to break down the 
morale of the police with the allegations 
they have lost their military campaigns but their goal has 
not changed vlok said they must get the police and the 
security forces out of their way to make it easier to bring about 
their aim of creating a communist state 
the weekly mail said de kock has been called to testify in two 
inquests involving eight deaths 
in one incident four black men were killed near durban in 1986 
nofomela has said he was present and that de kock was the officer 
in charge 
in the second incident four blacks were killed in a shooting 
near the south africaswaziland border last year

a federal judge today threw out the 
irancontra prosecutors criminal case against a former cia station 
chief who assisted oliver norths secret contra resupply operation 
us district court judge claude hilton dismissed the case 
against joseph fernandez saying that attorney general dick 
thornburghs affidavit barring disclosure of certain classified 
information made it impossible to give fernandez a fair trial 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh said it would 
appeal 
the judge said that the information thornburgh is blocking 
concerning cia facilities and programs in central america is 
essential for fernandez to receive a fair trial 
because of this said the judge the case will be dismissed 
fernandez the former cia station chief in costa rica was 
charged with obstructing inquiries into the irancontra affair by 
the cia inspector general and the presidentially appointed tower 
commission 
fernandez also was charged with two counts of making false 
statements in connection with his activities on behalf of norths 
network to arm the nicaraguan rebels at a time when congress had 
banned military aid to the contras 
we are troubled by the actions of the intelligence agencies 
and the attorney general who have made bringing this case to trial 
extremely difficult associate independent counsel laurence 
shtasel said 
hilton ruled last july that fernandez must be able to disclose 
at trial details about the locations of cia stations in el salvador 
and honduras as well as details about cia programs in costa rica 
this is a significant irancontra prosecution shtasel said 
we will now appeal judge hiltons rulings making every effort 
to bring the fernandez case to trial 
outside the courthouse fernandez said he was relieved that the 
freight train prosecution of the independent counsel is now 
blocked 
what troubles me about the independent counsels case is 
that the performance of legitimate duties by cia officers 
could subject them to criminal prosecution said fernandez 
he was asked whether he and his attorney thomas wilson had 
engaged in graymail the practice of trying to inject as much 
classified information as possible into a prosecution in order to 
torpedo the case 
that is an onerous and unnecessary comment replied 
fernandez the former cia station chief said he needed to present 
such information in order to mount an adequate defense 
wilson told the judge that the information thornburgh was 
barring from disclosure is the guts of the defenses case 
in court shtasel asked the judge to give the government until 
next week to propose narrowing the charges against fernandez so 
that the classified information at stake in the case would not have 
to be presented 
the attorney general filed an affidavit on wednesday barring 
disclosure of the secrets and shtasel said discussions have been 
underway with the cia since then in an attempt to balance the 
national security concerns while preserving some of the criminal 
charges 
but hilton refused to give the government more time noting that 
his rulings on what information fernandez needs to use were issued 
four months ago 
this is the first time that an attorney general has filed an 
affidavit barring disclosure of classified information in a 
criminal case and that a judge has dismissed the charges because of 
it 
walsh said that thornburgh should have filed his affidavit last 
july following hiltons rulings if that had been said walsh a 
proper appeal would have already been decided and the trial would 
have been concluded 
the independent counsels office has called much of the 
classified information that the government is protecting in the 
fernandez case fictional secrets that are already widely known 
to the public

discoverys crew worked through the 
second full day of the shuttles secret military space mission 
friday as officials on the ground kept a tight lid on what the five 
astronauts were doing 
they reportedly were conducting experiments for the star 
wars missile defense system and other military projects but 
there was no official word from nasa or the pentagon 
the media was blocked from listening to spacetoground 
conversations and communications between the astronauts and ground 
controllers were encrypted in case someone figured out how to 
eavesdrop 
mission control in houston broke the silence thursday night to 
report that discovery would return to earth on sunday landing at 
702 pm pst at edwards air force base calif it will be the 
third afterdark landing in 32 shuttle flights 
the statement also reported the crew is doing well and the 
orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily 
earlier sources close to the project said the astronauts had 
achieved the main goal of their mission by deploying a 2ton 300 
million satellite capable of monitoring military and diplomatic 
communications in the soviet union the middle east africa and 
europe 
there was no confirmation from the space agency or the defense 
department on the release of the satellite 
this is the fifth shuttle mission dedicated solely to military

in the past week tens of 
thousands of dedicated students have written a new chapter in the 
650yearold history of wenceslas square 
the vast expanse in the center of prague has been the scene of 
medieval markets colorful pageantry under austrian imperial rule 
and religious ceremonies honoring bohemias patron saint prince 
wenceslas murdered by heathen rebels more than a millennium ago 
wehrmacht soldiers lined it after the 1939 nazi takeover 
workers rallied on it in support of the communist putsch in 1948 
and in 1968 soviet t34 tanks parked on it following the moscowled 
invasion that put a bitter end to the prague spring reform 
movement of alexander dubcek who was then ousted 
hundreds of students then used their knowledge of russian for 
nightly discussions with the tank crews leaving them so 
demoralized that some units had to be replaced 
official tourist guides make no mention of those days on the 
square nor do they include any reference to young jan palach who 
burned himself on the square to protest the end of socialism with 
a human face 
after his death hundreds of candles were set in front of the 
statue of st wenceslas in the upper half of the 2500footlong 
200foot wide square palach has become a symbol of freedom and 
czechoslovak independence 
on friday the square was the scene of dubceks triumphant 
return to prague where he told 250000 antigovernment protesters 
that the ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the 
conditions of a new generation 
the square the social cultural and shopping center of the 
city is lined by shops hotels office and newspaper buildings 
most of them built in the late 19th century it was known as the 
horse market until 1848 because of its early importance as a site 
for horsetrading 
the upper end of the square is dominated by the national museum 
in addition to the statue of st wenceslas on horseback the 
square has statues of four other patron saints of bohemia 
ludmilla procopius agnes and adalbert 
hundreds of candles also have reappeared in the square since 
nov 17 when a peaceful rally in memory of a young student killed 
by the nazis 50 years ago was dispersed by batonwielding police 
it was that brutal repression that triggered the nationwide 
prodemocracy demonstrations it was the drop that made the keg 
filled to the brim with discontent spill over a noncommunist 
prague politician said 
the rally gave life to a protest movement that took less than 72 
hours to spread through the nation

for maros a teacher in this 
southern city breaking the habits of 24 years of fear does not 
come easily 
he is thrilled with czechoslovakias democracy movement but 
like many people who have endured decades of hardline communist 
rule he knows he has a lot to lose 
i want to be open and say what i feel but its not easy 
theres still something in me that says maybe hell give some 
information to the secret police says the young teacher 
jerking his chin at an imaginary informer 
sitting in a cafe sipping coffee he explained in halting 
english that he risks losing not only his job but the precious 
limited freedom he has carved out as a roman catholic he asked his 
surname not be used for fear of reprisal 
maros was at a friends mountain cottage last weekend when 
students in prague launched czechoslovakias first big 
antigovernment protests in years they heard about it on the voice 
of america a us governmentfunded radio station that broadcasts 
into eastern europe 
i havent had such a feeling in my life said the 
shorthaired teacher clad in a blue plaid shirt a gray sweatshirt 
and carefully pressed blue jeans in 1968 when such 
demonstrations were allowed i was 3 years old its something 
new 
when he returned monday to school in bratislava 
czechoslovakias secondlargest city the situation was in 
motion also here and he faced a difficult choice should he 
join 
a key dilemma was whether to risk exposing himself as an 
opponent of the communist government thereby jeopardizing the 
secret meetings he had been organizing for years to teach children 
about catholicism 
for 40 years children have grown up only in atheism i think 
its a basic right of mothers and fathers to raise children as they 
want he said describing with enthusiasm his lessons and field 
trips with the children 
on the one hand the political situation is not good but i 
can do something secretly he said or i could express my 
opinion in work and risk that they have written my name down 
somewhere and i will not be able to do this 
a similar dilemma arose for maros in march 1988 when 2000 
catholics demonstrated for religious freedom in bratislava riot 
police using water cannon broke up the protest and arrested 125 
people 
when there was this candlelight demonstration there was a 
great fight in the family especially with father he didnt want 
us to go because young people are willing to do such risky actions 
he said do we keep our church alive for 40 years then risk it 
just to hold a candle 
i was in my last year of university studies they officials 
said if students went they would be thrown out of school if i 
would be sent out my parents would suffer and so would my work 
maros decided not to go but his two younger brothers did 
i felt terrible i went to an alternative place to pray 
to be in contact through prayer when we heard the sirens whee 
whee whee i knew my brothers were there for what we want 
freedom our rights and i wasnt 
i felt i had to run there and be beat up too 
new protests broke out in bratislava on monday inspired by the 
mass rallies in prague calling for democracy and a new government 
the next day religious activists called for a demonstration 
wednesday outside a court in bratislava where a catholic dissident 
was being tried on political charges 
i wasnt initially sure about going i have a job maros 
said but on tuesday czechoslovakias primate cardinal frantisek 
tomasek added his voice to the chorus demanding democracy saying 
at this decisive moment no one must stand aside 
maros left a note on his door at school wednesday morning 
saying he would be back shortly he didnt return 
sitting in the cafe wednesday before attending bratislavas 
second protest rally of the day he talked of the years he had 
steeled himself to accepting only a little freedom in his life the 
secret meetings in which he taught children about god 
can you imagine you cannot phone a friend and say we will meet 
tonight or tomorrow in the church i am very afraid to phone 
somebody that we will have a religious meeting and give an address 
that is unthinkable 
this is what is deep in us such fear we want this 
freedom but we must learn it its deep in us but we arent yet 
used to such a situation

she is accused of supplying saudi sheiks and 
millionaire executives with call girls some who later appeared in 
the pages of penthouse magazine or married into prominent families 
prosecutors contend even celebrities paid up to 2000 a day for 
the sex services in exchange the highpriced prostitutes lived a 
jetset life following elite customers to paris london geneva 
new york and las vegas 
when vice officers crashed her west coast prostitution ring last 
year elizabeth adams at first denied she was a police informant 
later she recanted saying she manned an inside pipeline for 16 
years 
four of my girls married into very prominent families ms 
adams once said refusing to name names theyre so polished 
these people improved their lives thanks to me 
detective alan vanderpool described her service as the best 
vice capt james docherty portrayed ms adams as a multibuck 
bigtime madam 
ms adams began working with police in 1972 and relayed to them 
information her call girls gleaned from their clients she said in 
court papers her lawyer said she should be shielded from 
prosecution or at least kept from incarceration in exchange for 
her work as an informant 
ms adams 56 allegedly told police about people who were 
involved in prostitution rings along with firearms and narcotics 
trade 
police allege a saudi prince once ordered a ski companion for 
his son through ms adams most clients however were known only 
by code name 
a motion to dismiss the case of the beverly hills madam is to be 
heard dec 1 in superior court deputy district attorney alan 
carter said he is prepared to prosecute ms adams on two felony 
counts of pimping and pandering 
the charges carry a maximum of seven years in prison 
she became known as the beverly hills madam because many people 
alleged to be clients booked their trysts in posh beverly hills 
hotel suites 
defense attorney anthony p brooklier claims the case should be 
dismissed because police encouraged ms adams to continue her work 
and provide the department with inside information garnered in her 
pillow talk network 
for some reason when its sack time men make 
revelations she was quoted as saying last year by the los 
angeles times the women hear things that the state department 
would give its eye teeth for 
carter said in a recent interview he couldnt discuss the case 
ms adams also known as alex fleming was a police agent and 
officers should be bound by their promises that she would not be 
prosecuted or at a minimum that the defendant not be 
incarcerated brooklier argued 
ms adams freed on 210000 bail after being charged last year 
declined through brooklier to be interviewed and he refused to 
disclose where she was living 
in a declaration submitted to the court ms adams said she 
started working with police in 1972 following her arrest on 
pandering charges for her cooperation those charges were dropped 
deputy district attorney pamela ferrero said last year that ms 
adams police record included one felony conviction one 
misdemeanor guilty plea fines and probation from four 
prostitutionrelated arrests since 1972 
officials were well aware of my activities ms adams wrote 
in court documents she also said that because of her police 
connections she was severely beaten twice and required 
hospitalization for her injuries 
the information i provided led to the arrest and conviction of 
numerous offenders over a 16year period in return the law 
enforcement officials have agreed to protect me against any 
prosecution which would lead to incarceration for my activities 
ms adams told the court 
retired police sgt glenn r souza stated in an affidavit that 
ms adams was identified in the 1970s as an agent for the 
department by a us senate subcommittee 
he corroborated ms adams statement about the beatings and said 
she assisted detectives with information regarding numerous 
felony cases in the areas of prostitution firearms narcotics and 
other larcenous violations 
souza said ms adams assisted police from 1972 to 1982 but 
brooklier maintains the help continued until her arrest in 1988 
her enterprise unraveled when a former cook russell lucas went 
to police who sent in a young undercover policewoman to an 
interview with ms adams 
its just like going on a date but you get paid for it you 
never made money like this in your life ms adams told the 
officer in a taperecorded interview on feb 29 1988 get a 
passport paris geneva you get to see the world 
for fees of 150 an hour ms adams employees would dine at 
fine restaurants and take cruises to the bahamas she would keep 
400 of each 1000 made allegedly taking in about 100000 a 
month 
ms adams came from manila 20 years ago she worked as a florist 
and antique shop owner she said she was a mother and a widow when 
she was approached by an english madam who offered her a client

most foreigninvested joint ventures are 
reporting profits despite skepticism and a cloudy business climate 
after the bloody crackdown on political dissent in june a 
government news report said friday 
about 85 percent of the 8000 sinoforeign joint ventures that 
have started operations have been profitable xinhua news agency 
said 
if nobody makes a profit in china how can we explain the fact 
that the number of businesses with foreign capital is increasing 
year by year and many of them are expanding xinhua quoted jing 
shuping president of china international economic consultants as 
saying 
in the first three quarters of this year 4281 joint ventures 
were launched with a total contracted value of 4 billion xinhua 
said 
since marketoriented economic reforms were begun 10 years ago 
china has approved 20278 foreignfunded businesses including 
11286 equity joint ventures 7712 contractual joint ventures and 
1230 firms wholly owned by foreign investors the report said 
they accounted for pledges of 322 billion by foreign investors 
and paidin foreign investment of 141 billion 
the report quoted unnamed analysts as noting that low monthly 
wages of 27 low taxes and a potential market of 11 billion 
people are the main incentive for foreign investment in china 
it cited the example of yilinabisco biscuit and food co a 
sinous joint venture that makes ritz crackers which has 
captured 70 percent of the biscuit market in beijing and reached 
this years profit target in only six months 
but uncertainties following the armys crackdown on the 
studentled democracy movement led to an exodus of foreigners in 
june and sanctions imposed by western governments have frozen 
loans equipment and technical exports and certain kinds of 
insurance for firms doing business in china 
the government has launched a vigorous propaganda and financial 
aid campaign to reassure investors and lure new business 
after the mayjune unrest in beijing many foreign investors 
and business people became skeptical about chinese political and 
economic stability xinhua said while some have gradually 
overcome their concern after learning the true situation others 
are not sure how things really stand 
many of the joint ventures morever are strapped for funds 
under chinas yearold austerity program which cuts government 
spending and credits to industry and scrapped thousands of 
construction projects and implementation of new economic reforms 
some enterprises are now facing problems such as shortages of 
ready cash energy and raw materials xinhua said government 
departments are helping to tide them over by granting new loans and 
ensuring the supply of materials 
the bank of china the nations foreign exchange bank announced 
this week that it will extend 108 million in loans to foreign 
joint ventures because of the financial crunch 
the bank had already supplied 946 million in chinese currency 
and an additional 800 million to foreigninvested firms this year 
the bank of china is supporting 3000 such enterprises with 10 
different forms of loans to help them develop hightechnology and 
exportoriented goods 
the peoples bank of china the central bank and the industrial 
and commercial bank also disclosed this week that they were 
providing largescale loans to the government to purchase cars from 
faltering foreignfunded automakers whose stocks are piling up 
without buyers 
they include chryslers beijing jeep and the french peugeot 
joint venture in canton 
xinhua quoted jing as claiming that stability of leadership and 
support for the government are the basis for chinas renewed 
business stability 
despite the turmoil of a few months ago life is back to 
normal everywhere jing said people are walking about as 
relaxed as at any time before 
antigovernment and anticommunist party sentiment runs high 
however and beijing residents say privately they fear the 
continuing investigations into the uprising and calls by 
authorities to inform on fellow citizens who took part in the 
protests

president bush says he is prepared to think 
anew about reducing us troop levels abroad because of changes 
in eastern europe but wont take action without the european allies 
im not suggesting that forevermore well have the same levels 
of troops anywhere standing army europe korea anywhere else 
bush said in an interview with foreign journalists but were 
certainly not going to take any unilateral action 
we do what we do in conjunction with our allies bush said 
in the tuesday interview a transcript of which was released friday 
by the white house well be perfectly prepared to think anew 
always because were living in fascinating changing times 
first however bush said he wanted to await the outcome of 
talks with the soviets on conventional force levels in europe and 
also defense secretary dick cheneys review of pentagon budget 
priorities 
bush who is to meet for two days next week with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev said he was not a bit worried 
that the united states would lose its leadership role in the 
western alliance if the changes in eastern europe brought a 
significant drop in superpower tensions 
if tensions got so reduced that you didnt always worry about

if you just get together and discuss change that is my 
definition of success bush said 
were not looking forward to crossing ts and dotting is 
at this meeting bush said 
he said he believed the future of europe and the question of 
possible german reunification should be decided by the citizens of 
each nation facing change 
the role of the united states is to say heres what we think 
is best democracy freedom free elections freedom of the press 
freedom of worship this is what we believe 
some congressional democrats have labeled bush timid for not 
taking a more active approach to the changes in eastern europe 
with some critics suggesting he visit the berlin wall recently 
opened by east germany 
some have wanted me to go jump on top of the berlin wall he 
said well i never heard such a stupid idea i mean what good 
would it do for an american president to be posturing while germans 
were flowing back and forth by the millions it makes no sense at 
all 
and thats one of the reasons we as the united states are 
trying not to listen to those out there encouraging flamboyant 
action but to rather respond prudently as a great power must to 
the change he said

the yellowspotted turtle could fit in 
the palm of your hand and thats right where the creature has 
conrail and its plans to put a terminal at the turtles wetlands 
sanctuary 
the 4inch spotted turtle was once the most common turtle in 
massachusetts now the swampdweller is officially listed in 
massachusetts as a species of special concern 
philadelphiabased consolidated rail corp has been stalled in 
its tracks by concerns that seasonal vernal pools favored by the 
spotted turtle could be damaged if conrail goes ahead with plans to 
expand its 1000car terminal facility off route 495 to 2600 
spaces 
the case is similar to the tussle in the 1970s over the snail 
darter a tiny fish that held up construction of a tennessee dam 
for a decade 
in an attempt to soothe concerns of residents in this boston 
suburb and state environmentalists as well as addressing the 
needs of the turtle conrail has hired a pair of zoologists to 
study the spotted turtle and its habits 
the scientists will ultimately draft a plan for moving the 
reptile to new accommodations nearby that would replicate their old 
home 
there is a legitimate concern about the environment in this 
country said bruce wilson a senior vice president for legal 
affairs at conrail 
i believe in the need to balance our concerns with preserving 
the environment with the commercial demands that result from man 
himself being a domesticated animal wilson said this week 
the spotted turtle is far better off than the snail darter 
which was threatened with extinction by the dam 
as a species of special concern in massachusetts it sits 
two notches down from the ranks of those considered endangered 
wildlife of special concern are documented as being in decline and 
facing a threat of disappearing from the state said tom french 
assistant director of the state natural heritage and endangered 
species program 
the conrail plan for the turtles must pass muster with frenchs 
office its first hurdle in the turtle case 
conrail began in 1987 to plan a proposed 27acre project that 
would include paving 21 acres adjacent to the great cedar swamp a 
region designated by the state as one of critical environmental 
concern 
but it wasnt until april that environmental officials 
discovered the turtles there 
the terminal construction is expected to cost more than 20 
million the new expense of accommodating the turtles isnt known 
wilson said 
the turtles came as a surprise said wilson but he insists the 
railroad does not regard them as an obstacle 
we went into this project with the attitude that we were going 
to comply with whatever environmental laws were applicable to this 
project wilson said we have bent over backwards and assumed 
that wherever we ran into a problem we would take the measures 
appropriate were not going to run roughshod over the 
environmental laws 
if the research and plan are satisfactory the next steps are an 
environmental impact report and obtaining permits from the state 
department of environmental protection and the army corps of 
engineers 
but it is unlikely to be as easy as that the fight has already 
begun 
the westboro conservation commission approved the project but 
that was before the turtle problem turned up 
community activist michael hachey an engineer has joined in a 
lawsuit seeking reconsideration of the commissions action 
its an illadvised project with little benefit to the general 
public hachey said 
to build the facility conrail also needs a zoning variance as 
well as permission to pave portions of wetlands and replicate them 
elsewhere on the property 
it could be a long haul 
a lot of people say oh its just a silly little turtle 
said hachey but we dont regard it as a silly little turtle and 
if they conrail are able to lawyer their way around this itll 
be open season on statelisted rare species

requiring that one or both parents be notified before a minor gets 
an abortion 
those cases and an illinois dispute settled out of court 
earlier this week were seen by those on both sides of the issue 
as likely vehicles for the supreme court to expand or modify its 
july ruling allowing states greater leeway to restrict abortion 
the illinois case over state regulation of abortion clinics 
was the most likely of the three to result in changes to the 
courts 1973 roe vs wade ruling said jack tunheim chief deputy 
attorney general for minnesota the illinois case affected all 
women rather than just minors 
i dont think the illinois settlement will have any impact on 
our case tunheim said thursday the minnesota case and the 
ohio case both involve what we view as a very very different 
proposition the issue of minors abortions 
the settlement announced by illinois attorney general neil 
hartigan and officials of the illinois american civil liberties 
union would resolve a legal challenge to regulations requiring 
abortion clinics to be equipped and staffed like hospital operating 
rooms 
in the case ragsdale vs turnock dr richard ragsdale of 
rockford contended that the state regulations would make it much 
more difficult and costly for women to obtain abortions 
despite federal court rulings that the law unconstitutionally 
limited womens access to abortion illinois argued that the rules 
were necessary to protect womens health 
although regulations would be eased substantially for early 
abortions tougher regulations would apply to clinics performing 
the procedure after 18 weeks when there is a greater likelihood of 
a need for general anesthesia or the occurrence of complications 
jay miller executive director of the aclu of illinois said today 
however a requirement that has been stricken for all abortion 
clinics is a rule mandating that patients receive counseling from 
someone about birth control and adoption he said the old rules 
also required that the counselor must derive no profit from 
abortion procedures 
a prochoice group fund for the feminist majority says 91 
percent of abortions on american women are performed before the 
12th week 8 percent in the second trimester and 1 percent in the 
third 
antiabortion activists wanted the ragsdale case to go before 
the supreme court because a favorable ruling would have made it 
difficult for abortion clinics to operate said joseph schiedler 
director of the national prolife action league 
but either the ohio or minnesota case could still serve as a 
catalyst for eroding roe vs wade he said 
the court seems to be moving toward restricting abortions and 
they can do it with the cases they have left schiedler said 
thursday 
the ragsdale settlement still must be approved by a us 
district court judge in chicago 
attorneys for antiabortion groups will try to scuttle the 
settlement in district court in hopes it could still go before the 
supreme court schiedler said 
jay miller executive director of the aclu in illinois said he 
thought the ragsdale settlement indicated the tide was turning 
against efforts to undermine roe vs wade 
its still a crap shoot but im more optimistic said 
miller referring to the two abortion cases pending before the 
supreme court 
the key vote in the upcoming cases is expected to be cast by 
justice sandra day oconnor miller said 
in july hers was the fifth and decisive vote in webster vs 
reproductive health services in which the court allowed states 
greater leeway in regulating abortion the ruling came on a 
challenge to a missouri law that among other things banned 
abortions in public hospitals and clinics 
the bush administration is pressing the high court to use the 
ohio and minnesota cases to go beyond the missouri decision and 
overturn roe vs wade which legalized abortion 
neither minnesota nor ohio are asking the supreme court to 
overturn the pivotal ruling 
the ohio case stems from a 1985 state law that requires that at 
least one parent be notified at least 24 hours before an unmarried 
teen has an abortion 
a challenge by an akron abortion clinic on behalf of a teenage 
mother has been upheld by a federal appeals court 
in the minnesota case the us court of appeals for the 8th 
circuit upheld the states law requiring notification of both 
parents 
the aclu has filed a brief asking the supreme court to overturn 
the minnesota law on the grounds that the measure makes it more 
difficult for teenagers to obtain abortions 
both the ohio and minnesota laws permit teenagers to bypass 
this requirement by obtaining a confidential court ruling 
authorizing the abortion without parental involvement

maurice tempelsman a wealthy new york diamond 
merchant often seen at social events on the arm of jacqueline 
kennedyonassis is a major player behind the scenes of 
africanamerican relations 
little known to the public at large his name doesnt even 
appear in whos who tempelsman has contacts across the continent 
from when he started doing business more than three decades ago 
the 60yearold businessman is on a firstname basis with 
archbishop desmond tutu south africas antiapartheid activist is 
called grandpere by gabons president el hadj omar bongo and 
entertains zaire president sese seko mobutu 
until recently the balding portly teddy bear of a man 
preferred to remain behind the scenes 
in 1989 tempelsman became the board chairman of the prestigious 
africanamerican institute the countrys oldest nonprofit 
organization dedicated to improving relations between the 
continents 
in that capacity hes delivered lectures and continued to 
travel to africa as often as every two months 
as an astute businessman tempelsman has cultivated africans on 
all sides of the political spectrum he recently set up an office 
in mineralrich namibia in advance of novembers elections a 
precursor to independence in the south africarun territory 
over the years hes been criticized from the left because of 
his ties to debeers consolidated mines ltd which mines diamonds 
from south africa among other places and for once hiring the 
cias top africa official when the man retired from the agency 
the right recently questioned tempelsmans dealings with 
sovietbacked angola tempelsman said he has a commercial 
relationship with that countrys national diamond co the angolan 
government is embroiled in civil war with usbacked rebels led by 
jonas savimbi 
howard phillips of the conservative caucus a lobbying group 
also has suggested that tempelsman may have had something to do 
with angolas contract to sell oil to citizens corp a 
bostonbased energy company started by rep joe kennedy dmass 
mrs onassis nephew 
tempelsman poohpoohs these attacks as coming from a group of 
zealots who look at things from a conspiratorial point of view 
rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house africa 
subcommittee said tempelsman frequently has attended the panels 
hearings 
tempelsman who generally favors economic sanctions against 
whiteruled south africa recently fought efforts to include uncut 
diamonds in the sanctions bill wolpe said 
with the help of his lawyer theodore sorenson former 
speechwriter for the late president kennedy tempelsman helped 
persuade wolpe and others that diamond sanctions would hurt 
countries like botswana more than south africa because uncut 
diamonds are not identified by their country of origin 
a staunch democrat tempelsman gives freely to the party as well 
as to its political candidates 
nevertheless he praised reagan administration officials for 
brokering a plan that led to elections in namibia and an agreement 
to withdraw cuban troops from angola 
tempelsman is the chief executive officer of lazare kaplan 
international a diamondcutting concern as well as a general 
partner in leon tempelsman and son inc an investment company with 
interest in minerals agriculture and industry 
in a wideranging interview at his penthouse office overlooking 
new yorks fifth avenue the belgiumborn tempelsman reflected on 
how his business interests merged with his appreciation for africa 
and how he sees the future of the worlds leastdeveloped continent 
his office guarded by a tight security system is tastefully 
furnished with african art all around are books and magazines 
dealing with art from africa and the greek and roman periods 
one is fortunate when career interests and philosophical 
interests coincide he said its always nicer to work at 
something you like doing 
the tempelsman family came to the united states around world war 
ii but tempelsman didnt get involved in africa until business 
took him to ghana the former gold coast in the mid1950s 
decolonization which has taken place over the last three 
decades has been one of the more historical events in mankinds 
history tempelsman said i think namibia is the last chapter 
while tempelsman has prospered in part because of africas 
minerals some countries have seen their standards of living 
decline and their people embroiled in endless civil wars 
describing nationbuilding as a risky adventure tempelsman 
said that continent is going through an agonizing period mostly 
economic some selfinflicted some subject to other factors 
to alleviate some countries problems tempelsman favors action 
from washington to wipe out some of their debt as well as more aid 
generally though tempelsman said foreigners cant dictate to 
africans how they should run their countries 
it has to come from their own internal processes he said 
we can hector and condemn but in the end both the benefits and 
the fruit of political independence mean you have the right to make 
your own mistakes

for the impenetrability of murphs message in game programs 
we cannot fall into the trap of committing practical 
haplography murphy wrote it is also a dangerous feeling to 
consider that where we are in the league is of acceptable standard 
because standard is relevant to the standards we have set which 
thereby may well indicate that we have not aspired to the standard 
which we set ourselves 
websters new world dictionary third college edition does not 
define haplography but ms maher said it means accidentally 
dropping a letter or syllable when writing a word 
murphy was also cited for this one we must be the harbingers 
and nothing less than this can be acceptable 
the other winners came from the usual ranks of bureaucrats and 
offices and only three showed up to collect murphy was among the 
missing 
halifax building society won a golden bull for a letter which 
explained in answer to paragraph two of your letter the 
regulation 2b states that the provisions contained in the 
mortgage conditions concerning insurance on the property will only 
be enforced if the borrower contravenes or does not comply with the 
property insurance regulations 
the tax office in aberdeen scotland scored with this letter

east german leader egon krenz conceded friday 
his communist partys hardline policies had plunged the nation 
into crisis 
labor leaders meanwhile called for an investigation of another 
disgraced communist 
also on friday a third weekend of frenzied shopping and 
sightseeing began for east germans as tens of thousands started 
streaming into west germany and west berlin 
in its public statements the communist party appeared to be 
trying to show that past leaders and not krenz and his new 
government are responsible for repression and economic stagnation 
in east germany 
krenz told the communist party daily neues deutschland that he 
agrees with reformists calls for an end to his partys guaranteed 
leading role 
demands for abolition of the constitutional mandate for 
communist party rule have spread from proreform citizens groups to 
the ruling circle as the current leaders struggle to divorce 
themselves from the policies of the past 
but krenz and other senior party and government officials were 
closely associated with ousted leader erich honecker the 
association has robbed them of public gratitude for the popular 
reforms such as relaxed censorship and freedom to travel 
in the battle to boost living standards and the leaders 
credibility party officials have launched investigations into 
alleged misuse of office by honecker and his top lieutenants they 
have also joined the chorus of calls for sharing power 
krenz was asked during the neues deutschland interview about 
prodemocracy activistss attacks on article 1 the constitutional 
mandate for communist control 
we are in favor of abolishing it he replied 
he said a partys success is not put forth through laws or 
declarations but can only result from work performance and its 
attitude 
krenz responded to widespread accusations of communists abuse 
of office by saying we are not a corrupt party 
but he conceded the communists were responsible for many basic 
mistakes ultimately the crisis of our society 
leaders of the governmentrun labor union friday asked for an 
investigation of harry tisch an ousted politburo member and the 
former government labor chief for alleged abuse of power 
on thursday the embattled party announced it had opened an 
investigation into alleged wrongdoing by honecker and expelled the 
former economy chief from the party 
krenzs close association with honeckers rule has fueled 
speculation that he may lose the party leadership at a special 
congress to be held dec 1517 
since nov 9 when east germanys travel rules were rescinded 
more than 6 million have visited west germany mostly on the 
weekends 
the vast majority have returned to their homes and jobs in east 
germany but west german officials reported a trend toward more 
resettlers 
nearly 2000 east germans asked to stay in the 24 hours prior to 
friday morning compared with 865 during the previous day 
in an interview with the newspaper tribuene east germanys new 
minister for finance and prices conceded that the longdemanded 
onetoone exchange rate for east german marks with west german 
marks is unrealistic 
the minister uta nickel said a true rate of exchange could be 
44 east german marks to each west german mark which is still less 
than half the unofficial rate set by traders in the west 
east germany has rejected immediate setting of a conversion rate 
in fear that the subsequent price rises would be too harsh for 
those with fixed incomes to bear 
but the lack of legal means to convert east marks for western 
shopping trips has unleashed rampant blackmarket trading 
guenter hartmann head of the national democratic party allied 
with the ruling communists was quoted by the west german newspaper 
bild as saying east germany plans to devote at least 162 billion 
in hard currency to a travel fund for east germans 
bild also quoted hartmann as proposing a council to handle 
affairs of concern to both nations but said he called on bonn to 
guarantee the existence of a separate east german state 
west germany has been hesitant to enter into treaties and 
contractual agreements that are tantamount to full recognition of 
east german statehood the west german constitution embraces a goal 
of eventual reunification 
hartmann was quoted by bild as saying that a single german state 
was not excluded from possibility in the distant future but 
that it is not open for discussion at present 
also friday austrian chancellor franz vranitzky visited east 
berlin and signed a wideranging agreement on economic cooperation 
east germany says it will encourage greater business cooperation as 
part of the effort to stabilize the economy

communist party chief nicolae 
ceausescu the east blocs longestreigning leader was reappointed 
friday in a lavish show of support for his rejection of reforms 
washing over his communist neighbors 
delegates to the 14th communist party congress cheered and 
clapped rhythmically in a repetition of the staged displays of 
adulation for their hardline leader that have marked the congress 
since it opened monday 
ceausescu 71 told delegates he has no plans to step down from 
the post he has held for 24 years his new term is for five years 
i would like to assure the congress the people and the nation 
that in the future i will continue to be a soldier fighting for 
socialism and romania he declared his voice rising to a near 
scream 
romania has achieved a number of victories in its 1000year 
history but none so great as the building of a new socialist 
society said ceausescu who is called the conducator or 
supreme leader 
as he spoke inside downtown palace hall parade marshals and 
police positioned phalanxes of workers youth group members and the 
paramilitary peoples guard in preparation for his appearance 
state radio later said about 125000 people turned out the 
square before the central committee building was full with the 
crowds spilling into side streets 
in his keynote speech monday ceausescu condemned the whirlwind 
of democratization changing the systems of the formerly rigid 
warsaw pact nations but he refrained from that theme in his 
onehour speech friday 
he lauded the role of the working class in doing away with 
the outmoded system of bourgeois democracy 
his wife elena sat on ceausescus right on a stage reserved 
for ranking officials and foreign dignitaries she gazed stolidly 
at the crowd below in a scene reminiscent of soviet bloc party 
congresses of the stalinist era 
even before the onset of liberalization in the rest of the 
soviet bloc ceausescu had been considered among the most hardline 
communist leaders with his countrys human rights record a 
frequent target of criticism abroad 
an openingday boycott of most of the 16member nato alliance 
was later expanded with switzerland austria and most latin 
american democracies breaking with past practice and keeping their 
heads of diplomatic missions away from the congress in protest 
strong suppression of any opposition to ceausescus rule has 
generated a general climate of oppression contributing to the 
problems of a population that has suffered through years of food 
and energy shortages idling cars and keeping homes unheated during 
the winter 
his governments program of razing ethnic hungarian villages in 
romania has led to his condemnation by human rights groups 
ceausescus steel grip on the party and on society has resulted 
in the development of a personality cult unequalled since the 
1950s when the soviet union feard and feted stalin and its 
satellites their own leaders 
slogans of love and admiration sounded for ceausescu within the 
congress hall were repeated by the masses later as ceausescu 
addressed them from the main balcony of the party headquarters 
draped with a redandwhite slogan proclaiming ceausescu 
romania freedom 
the whole activity of our party will be dedicated to building 
communism and safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of 
romania he declared 
the congress theoretically had the power to reject ceausescu 
but his continued role as leader had been a foregone conclusion 
with officials rolling their eyes when asked if he would be 
opposed he was the only official candidate 
ceausescu was elected by the newly chosen 467member central 
committee of old and new ceausescu stalwarts who in turn had been 
chosen by the delgates the central committee also picked a 
47member executive political committee or politburo 
delegates also gave rubberstamp approval to an economic program 
for the next five years and beyond foreseeing a strengthened 
role for the communist party in daily affairs 
ceausescu called for the annulment of the 1939 sovietnazi 
germany treaty that agreed to the partition of much of eastern 
europe among the powers one secret provision of the treaty ceded 
the romanian province of bessarabia to the soviet union and gave 
moscow control over the baltic states

communist party chief milos jakes 
and the rest of the communist leadership resigned today after more 
than a week of huge protests of their hardline policies staterun 
media said 
the resignations were offered at a closeddoor emergency 
session of the party central committee which was expected to 
approve them 
they came after jakes 67 admitted that the party had not 
instituted reforms quickly enough and had seriously underestimated 
the effect of the prodemocracy movement sweeping eastern europe 
he was the third east bloc leader to fall from power in a little 
more than a month as support for the reforms instituted by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev gains momentum 
as the party met hundreds of thousands of people in downtown 
prague cheered alexander dubcek the former party chief whose 
attempts to institute reforms in 1968 were brutally crushed by a 
warsaw pact invasion 
jakes was responsible for the purge of dubcek and a halfmillion 
other reformers from the communist party after the invasion he 
took over as communist party chief in december 1987 
in its terse dispatch the staterun new agency ctk announced 
the general secretary of the czechoslovak communist party 
milos jakes and all other members of the ruling politburo and 
secretariat submitted their resignations so that a new leadership 
of the party could be elected jakes said he hoped the newly 
elected organs of the party will contribute to a more resolute 
implementation of the process of restructuring and democratization 
during the evening session proposals for personnel changes 
will be considered and a new leadership will be elected by secret 
ballot ctk said 
the dispatch said 30 more people were still due to speak at the 
meeting so it was not clear when the new leadership might be named 
shortly before the announcement dubcek made a triumphant return 
to prague speaking in public in the capital for the first time 
since his ouster 
dubcek dubcek and long live dubcek a crowd of 250000 
yelled as the former leader appeared at pragues central wenceslas 
square the site of repeated prodemocracy demonstrations 
the ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the 
conditions of a new generation dubcek told the crowd 
we must unify to raise our country to a higher level he 
declared in a fiveminute speech 
an old wise man said if there once was light why should 
there be darkness again let us act in such a way to bring the 
light back again he said 
dubcek appealed to police militia and the army to stand by 
the peoples side and not to destroy the search for democracy 
do not act against the people remember you are from the 
people dubcek said he also warned demonstrators to avoid 
extremist trends 
every day for a week thousands of people have turned out for 
prodemocracy protests in czechoslovakia 
they had demanded the resignation of jakes president gustav 
husak and other leaders associated with the hardline policies 
pursued since warsaw pact tanks snuffed out dubceks reform 
the protests began after police on nov 17 brutally crushed a 
peaceful demonstration in prague for the past week jakes had 
denounced the protesters as antisocialists but today as he 
opened his last communist party meeting he admitted his politburo 
had made serious mistakes 
for a week our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere 
accompanied by large demonstrations the official ctk quoted 
jakes as saying the tension is gradually spreading to other 
places in the republic we must openly say that our country is at a 
fatal crossroads 
we have underestimated completely the processes taking place 
in poland hungary and especially recently in east germany and 
their effect and influence on our society said jakes 
east germany has instituted reforms including opening its 
borders and carving holes in the berlin wall since longtime 
leader erich honecker was ousted amid nationwide unrest on oct 18 
this month another communist hardliner todor zhivkov of 
bulgaria also lost his position and poland led the way by 
installing the first noncommunistled government in the east bloc 
the lone holdout among warsaw pact leaders now appears to be 
nicolae ceausescu of romania who has staunchly opposed democratic 
reforms he was reelected to another fiveyear term today

hundreds of people lined up early 
to buy a 5cent copy of pragues svobodne slovo newspaper but even 
the 50000 extra copies printed failed to satisfy demand for the 
new champion of press freedom 
since monday the 45yearold newspaper has lived up to its name 
free word and has become a key voice for democratic change in 
the reform movement sweeping the country 
thats when its front page condemned a brutal police attack on 
thousands of students assembled for a peaceful rally on wenceslas 
square not far from its editorial offices 
the newspaper brought a roar of applause from nearly 200000 
prodemocracy marchers who chanted the newspapers name when they 
marched past its building circulation shot up 20 percent and it 
has been selling out by midday 
it was a heartwarming experience said deputy foreign 
editor adam cerny 
i am very proud karel volesky head of the newspapers book 
department told a reporter we were the first to supply free 
information 
editors have been busy over battered typewriters the offices 
have not seen a painter for decades and metal tubes containing 
copy rattle down to the printshop through the pneumatic dispatch 
system causing a noise as if the walls were caving in 
its a museum cerny said with a smile the printing 
presses date to 1936 
since tuesday svobodne slovo also has made available a 
thirdfloor balcony of its building as a rostrum for the speakers 
addressing the giant rallies pressing for changes in the nations 
leadership every afternoon 
officially svobodne slovo is the newspaper of the socialist 
party an ally of the ruling communist party 
but it departed months ago from the staid fellowtraveler line 
that has made czechoslovak readers buy newspapers chiefly to read 
the sports page crossword puzzles or ads 
mondays issue however made the paper a real thorn in the 
flesh of hardline communists 
we have information that conservatives are sabotaging the 
distribution to places outside prague volesky said packages 
with newspapers were removed from trains but now students help us 
they drive out in their cars with the newspapers 
i am very proud he repeated

maronite catholic legislator to be the new president to replace 
rene mouawad who was assassinated after only 17 days in office 
the election of hrawi 59 a wealthy agricultural engineer was 
expected to advance efforts to form a national unity government 
that would introduce political reforms aimed at ending lebanons 
brutal 14yearold civil war 
but that effort will be opposed by the christian army commander 
gen michel aoun who condemns the peace plan brokered by the arab 
league because it fails to say when syrias 40000 troops will be 
withdrawn from lebanon 
after being elected by lawmakers meeting under tight security in 
a hotel at this market town east of beirut and sworn in by speaker 
hussein husseini as lebanons 10th president hrawi made an 
acceptance speech in it he pledged to adhere to the taif accord 
and work for peace in lebanon 
he referred to the peace plan worked out by lebanese legislators 
last month in the saudi arabia resort of taif with the aim of 
ending the civil war 
i promise the nation to follow the same path that martyred

polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki assured 
the soviet union on friday it could count on the solid partnership 
of the east blocs only noncommunistled government but said 
poland wants to close deep historic wounds 
president mikhail s gorbachev warmly greeted the former 
solidarity editor and said that relations with poland were 
improving 
the election of mazowiecki on aug 24 ended more than 40 years 
of communist rule in poland he saluted gorbachevs policy of 
perestroika and our and your freedom and solidarity 
the changes which are taking place in our country do not alter 
the international obligations of poland and nobody should see in 
them a threat on the contrary they contribute to the stability of 
europe and strengthen us as a reliable and solid partner he said 
but speaking at a kremlin dinner after his first day of talks 
with the soviet leadership mazowiecki raised the painful issue of 
the massacre of polish officers in the katyn forest during world 
war ii which still hinders real reconciliation between poles and 
soviet 
for poles the katyn crime remains a wound which has not 
healed mazowiecki said we want to close all difficult 
chapters of history this is not only a matter for our alliance 
but for a real reconciliation of our peoples which is necessary for 
us and for you 
more than 4300 polish officers were slain in the katyn forest 
near smolensk in the soviet union moscow maintains the men were 
murdered by the nazis in 1941 while most poles and western 
historicans believe the soviet secret police murdered them in 1940 
katyn was one of the issues that mazowiecki discussed when he 
met gorbachev for the first time friday his spokeswoman said 
gorbachev said greater contact would further improve relations 
with his government 
maybe somebody would be surprised that i want to wish you 
success gorbachev told mazowiecki we are no less interested 
that your government and your nation has success 
we too are very interested in the success of perestroika 
replied mazowiecki through a translator referring to gorbachevs 
program of political and economic restructuring 
gorbachev spoke to a group of reporters in his kremlin office 
before receiving mazowiecki 
if you look back on our history what is going on between our 
two countries is that there are new relations i am sure this is 
for our mutual benefit gorbachev said relations between our 
peoples have changed for the better 
mazowiecki who spent over a year in jail after the 1981 
martiallaw crackdown appeared relaxed despite the tight security 
and strict protocol 
poles held the soviets responsible for the installation of a 
communist regime after world war ii but have welcomed perestroika 
and gorbachevs policy of not interfering with democratic reforms 
under way in eastern europe 
polish government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said 
later the meeting lasted nearly two hours the prime minister is 
very very satisfied with these talks she said they were 
very very open wide and friendly 
she quoted mazowiecki as saying that gorbachev is very 
interested in and knows a lot about poland and approaches the 
country with understanding 
niezabitowska said both sides also discussed economic issues 
the dramatic changes in east germany and the ussoviet summit 
she gave no details 
tass said gorbachev had expressed concern about a revanchist 
mood in connection with the events in east germany both poland and 
the soviet union have suffered from german aggression and appear 
concerned about the reemergence of a unified germany 
gorbachevs upcoming meeting with pope john paul ii an old 
friend of mazowieckis from his days as editorinchief of a 
catholic weekly also was discussed she said mazowiecki a roman 
catholic chose to make his first foreign trip to rome to meet the 
pope rather than to moscow as was required of his communist 
predecessors 
he also discussed polands debt to the soviet union and the 
issue of soviet oil and natural gas deliveries with soviet premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov niezabitowska said the polish side asked for 
an increase in gas deliveries and ryzhkov pledged to honor its 
agreements with poland she said 
poland would like the soviet union to ease repayment terms of 
its 15 billion hardcurrency debt to the soviet union and is 
seeking to have future trade calculated on the basis of world 
prices 
the soviet union accounts for onethird of polands foreign 
trade and working groups have been set up to work out ways to 
restructure economic relations 
the new government has developed a marketoriented economic 
reform program and starting next year niezabitowska said that up 
to 15 percent of all exchanges would be on an experimental basis

prime minister toshiki kaifu promised to work 
harder for political reforms friday the same day the first trial 
opened in a bribery scandal that toppled a predecessor and still 
shakes japanese politics 
two defendants denied bribery charges related to an alleged 
influencepeddling scandal involving officials and the recruit co 
an information and publishing conglomerate 
kaifu told reporters the recruit affair was an incident that 
should never be repeated i think we have to work even harder on 
political reforms 
takashi kato a former vice minister of labor and masao 
tatsumi a former recruit executive pleaded innocent as their 
trials opened in tokyo district court 
kato 59 who was in a position to supervise recruits lucrative 
publishing business was charged with receiving a bribe in the form 
of discounted shares in a recruit subsidiary 
the prosecution alleges kato influenced labor ministry 
regulations to benefit recruits booming business 
but kato while acknowledging the purchase of shares said he 
was not aware of a bribery intent behind the stock deal and denied 
doing any favors for the company 
because of a lack of discretion i have considerably damaged 
the credibility of the labor administration and caused trouble for 
the government and the court and i deeply regret it kato told 
the court 
but all the measures i have taken in the labor administration 
were i believed most suitable and i have never treated a specific 
company with a special favor he said 
tatsumi 47 who allegedly played an intermediary role between 
kato and recruits founder hiromasa ezoe said he has no part in 
the bargain stock deal 
i have never discussed the stock deal with mr kato and mr 
ezoe and i have no knowledge about the details of the stock deal 
with mr kato tatsumi said 
ezoe will be tried dec 15 on seven counts of bribery four 
other trials are starting before dec 15 for two leading 
politicians six bureaucrats and four executives of the recruit 
co which is accused of trying to win favors and influence by 
showering huge donations and stock deals 
in charging kato tatsumi and others involved in the stock deal 
prosecutors referred to a 1988 supreme court decision suggesting 
that trading stocks certain to rise in value and difficult for the 
general public to obtain could amount to bribery 
kato said in his defense he had no knowledge that the shares 
were certain to rise in value or that the public would not be able 
to obtain them he also said he was not aware the stock prices were 
set at artificially low levels as alleged 
the trial is to resume dec 26 
defendants in later trials include ezoe and takao fujinami a 
former chief cabinet secretary 
the recruit scandal has shaken the foundation of japanese 
politics since it erupted last summer it forced prime minister 
noboru takeshita from office and has been blamed for the governing 
liberal democrats setback in july elections for the upper house of 
parliament 
in a desperate attempt to leave the scandal behind the liberal 
democrats selected the relatively young kaifu as premier in august 
kaifu reiterated friday that his party is following new 
guidelines curbing political donations from corporations 
the party is considering whether to call elections for the more 
powerful lower house early next year

doctors tried for five years to fuse the 10 
personalities of ross carlson so he could stand trial for the 
murder of his parents his attorney believes death succeeded where 
the doctors failed 
i think death was the final solution that caused the fusion of 
the personalities which the state hospital refused to do said 
walter gerash who represented carlson throughout the case 
carlson died thursday at university hospital of complications 
from leukemia he was 19 when the crimes were committed and 25 
when he died 
he was charged with the aug 18 1983 killings of his parents 
rod and marilyn carlson whose bodies were found beside an isolated 
road in douglas county just south of denver they were found face 
down shot to death 
he was arrested and charged with the deaths he pleaded innocent 
by reason of insanity and a psychiatrist said he thought the 
teenager was suffering from multiplepersonality disorder 
therapists eventually said they identified as many as 10 
personalities and carlson spent five years in the colorado state 
hospital in pueblo 
but gerash said they hired debunkers instead people who know 
how to treat the disorder 
gerash said he had hoped therapy would fuse carlsons 
personalities making him well enough to stand trial 
carolyn herzberger a spokesman for colorado state hospital 
refused to comment friday on the case anything we did in an 
attempt to fuse his personalities is privileged information about a 
patient and no hospital in the country is going to discuss that 
she said 
only last month douglas county senior judge robert kingsley 
ruled that carlson was competent to stand trial and one was 
scheduled next month 
kingsley said he thought carlsons personalities were simply a 
good acting job 
just days after the competency ruling carlson was rushed to the 
hospital after a vomiting spell on nov 7 doctors confirmed a 
diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
carlson initially refused chemotherapy because his wrists were 
shackled gerash said some of his personalities felt threatened by 
the restraints the shackles were removed and chemotherapy began 
on sunday carlson tried to wrestle a gun from a deputy sheriff 
guarding him his attorney said it was an attempt to commit suicide 
on thursday he died the controversy continues 
gerash said he talked to almost all of the personalities and 
said no one really understood carlson or his illness 
most of the time i talked to justin he varied a lot between 
justin and another personality steve a 40yearold person who was 
very articulate in 1985 he developed another personality holden 
a hospital personality i also saw a weeping child blue handling 
the leukemia there was a child of 11 gray and i saw black i was 
threatened once by black 
i saw another guy norman who was prehomicidal a 
toughtalking new yorker who smokes carlson was allergic to smoke 
but i saw him smoke he said 
however the judge was not the only one who doubted carlsons 
diagnosis a columnist in the denver post on sunday criticized the 
1180 a day spent on caring for carlsons leukemia which also 
will be billed to taxpayers because his trust fund ran out 
the columnist woody paige wrote doctors have talked to a 
myriad of carlsonproduced personalities steve justin black 
blue gray stacey michael norman and the antichrist wheres 
dopey and sneezy is this one person or a touch football team 
im certainly not making light of mental illness trust me it 
is a serious matter but the mighty carlson art players and their 
act is beginning to wear thin 
gerash said he understands the anger from the community 
when you kill your father and mother thats a wholesale 
violation of the ten commandments he said

police opened fire and hurled tear gas 
friday to halt battling over ballot boxes and at least 36 people 
died in the second day of voting in indias bloody parliamentary 
elections 
at least 88 people have been killed since voting began wednesday 
to elect a new parliament and to decide the fate of prime minister 
rajiv gandhi 
an assailant fired three shots at a polling booth in northern 
india moments after opposition leader vishwanath pratap singh 
arrived to investigate reports of ballot fraud by gandhi supporters 
no one was hurt in the attack which occurred as singh was 
surrounded by voters complaining that gandhis congress party was 
rigging the vote witnesses said 
the national election commission flooded with complaints from 
both sides of voter intimidation and fraud again threw out 
thousands of ballots and said those voters must go back to the 
polls saturday voting is scheduled to end sunday 
at stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the 
policymaking lower house of parliament which will choose the next 
prime minister 
turnout was moderate to heavy in the 10 states and two federally 
governed territories that voted friday analysts have said a heavy 
turnout could hurt gandhi dogged for half of his fiveyear term by 
allegations of highlevel corruption in his government 
indian elections are traditionally violent at least 132 people 
have been killed in campaignrelated violence since gandhi 
announced elections on oct 17 
in southern karnataka and the northern states of uttar pradesh 
and bihar campaign activists battled friday while trying to storm 
polling booths tear up ballots and voter lists and stuff or steal 
ballot boxes officials said at least 33 people were killed 
police fired into the air and hurled tear gas to disperse the 
stonethrowing mobs there and in calcutta the capital of west 
bengal state 
mobs in calcutta attacked an office of the communist party of 
indiamarxist the governing party in the state police clashed 
with supporters of various parties who were attempting to seize 
ballot boxes three people were killed several polling booths also 
were bombed although no one was hurt officials said 
in western gujarat state authorities imposed an indefinite 
curfew in some towns after police fired tear gas to break up 
clashes between rival groups 
the election commission in new delhi has invalidated ballots in 
more than 930 of the countrys 590000 voting booths following 
reports of fraud 
the number of repolls ordered by the commission more than 
doubles the 480 ordered during the december 1984 elections that 
propelled gandhi to power two months after the assassination of his 
mother and predecessor prime minister indira gandhi 
gandhi whose congress party has governed india for all but 29 
months since independence from britain in 1947 is facing the most 
cohesive and determined challenge ever mounted by the countrys 
usually splintered opposition parties 
the national front a fiveparty coalition with wideranging 
regional religious and ideological differences has promised clean 
government 
gandhi has told voters that the only party that can provide 
stablity is his congress party whose most famous leaders were his 
mother and his grandfather jawaharlal nehru 
singh went to the village of dubrai 14 miles west of fatephur 
in uttar pradesh state after receiving reports that congress party 
workers were rigging the ballots 
the shots apparently were fired from a nearby rooftop after 
singh stepped out of his car and was surrounded by a crowd of 
people said a witness speaking on condition of anonymity 
singh refused to say whether he thought the shots were aimed at 
him specifically 
the aim was obviously the crowd of people and i was one of 
them said the 58yearold politican 
singh spent all day touring the fatehpur constituency saying he 
wanted to prevent a recurrence of the allegedly widespread fraud 
and voter intimidation that took place in gandhis amethi 
constituency during wednesdays balloting 
villagers armed with batons and spears screamed death to the 
congress and promised to protect voters from troublemakers

bad weather friday night once again 
forced british businessman richard branson to delay the greatest 
adventure of his life a hotair balloon crossing of the pacific 
ocean 
as hundreds of townspeople gathered in the cold late friday and 
city officials prepared a fireworks display branson held a news 
conference to announce the launch was being postponed 
my own feeling was to just tell the guys to get on with it 
said branson dressed in his gray fireproof flight suit but 
theres just nothing you can do about the weather 
he said a wind flowing down the side of a hill and onto the 
launch area had forced the liftoff scheduled for 3 am saturday 
1 pm friday est to be called off he said he did not know when 
they would try again 
a team of at least 60 technicians and staff has been on standby 
at the site for more than a week 
branson and his copilot per lindstrand want to become the 
first people to cross the pacific in a hotair balloon the 
6200mile flight to san francisco is expected to take three to 
four days but the two are equipped to spent five days in the 
balloon 
im about to embark on the greatest adventure of my life and 
im determined to enjoy it branson founder of virgin atlantic 
airways and the virgin music group said in an interview with the 
associated press 
he and lindstrand already hold the hotair balloon distance 
record for a flight across the atlantic in 1987 that trip ended 
when the balloon flew out of control into the irish sea off 
scotland 
final preparations for this flight including the 6hourlong 
process of filling up the balloon began friday evening on a 
baseball diamond in a local park that was turned into a launch pad 
at the planned cruising altitude of 40000 feet winds can reach 
200 mph 
organizers said the flight would set three records duration 
distance and altitude 
they also said the balloon dubbed the virgin otsuka pacific 
flyer is the largest ever built it has a diameter of 172 feet and 
weighs one ton 
miyakonojo is a small town surrounded by rice paddies and 
volcanic hills on the southern japanese island of kyushu it is 
about 560 miles south of tokyo far enough away from the citys 
busy air space to allow the balloon safe entry into the jet stream 
city officials had arranged to have a fireworks demonstration at 
liftoff and chartered buses to take people to the site 
no one has successfully crossed the pacific in a hotair 
balloon though three americans and a japanese adventurer piloted a 
heliumfilled craft across it from japan to california in 1981

president bush and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher agreed today on the need for european stability 
as the nato alliance faces changes in eastern europe the white 
house said 
the two leaders meeting for 4 hours at the presidents country 
retreat discussed a number of issues to be taken up at bushs 
summit next week with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev as well as 
other issues said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the president and prime minister discussed reforms under way 
in the soviet union and agreed on support for glasnost and 
perestroika they both emphasized the pursuit of democracy as the 
first step in the reform process said fitzwater 
mrs thatcher arrived by helicopter at the snowy hillside 
complex where bush and his family are spending the thanksgiving 
holiday 
she stepped onto a red carpet rolled out in the snow and was 
greeted by bush clad in a sports jacket first lady barbara bush 
wearing a down jacket and daughter dorothy leblond also greeted 
the prime minister 
bush escorting mrs thatcher to a golf cart said lets go 
before we freeze he said im so glad youre here this is so 
timely an apparent reference to the fact that mrs thatchers 
visit comes a week before bush will hold a shipboard summit with 
gorbachev 
asked by reporters what they would discuss bush said before 
driving off in the golf cart im just interested in getting the 
views of the prime minister on the rapid changes in eastern europe 
and the strength of the alliance and everything else so weve got 
a good full agenda 
asked if the two leaders had any disagreements on the strength 
of nato mrs thatcher replied emphatically no none mrs 
thatcher has been firm in her statements that the strength of nato 
should not be lessened despite overtures from the soviet union and 
moves toward political and economic reform in several eastern 
european countries 
in an nbctv today interview earlier she said that merely 
expressing a willingness for political reform is a lot different 
than actually achieving it 
she told cbstvs this morning that she did not expect 
gorbachev to have any major surprises at the summit 
after all look at the events which have happened i think 
that hell want to work towards much greater security and to try to 
bring about the economic reform she said 
bush in recent days has emphasized that he intends to consult 
fully with us allies before meeting with gorbachev and that he 
would spring no surprises on the nato allies 
mrs thatcher was to remain at camp david for four hours before 
returning to washington in the afternoon 
mrs thatcher said on abcs good morning america program 
today that she was delighted with bushs speech in which he 
praised gorbachevs reforms and praised bushs measured 
response to changes in eastern europe 
it takes a long time to build democracy she said its 
not so long to have demonstrations and to try to say that you want 
to tear down that system it takes a much longer time to build up 
the new one 
mrs thatcher is effusive in her praise of gorbachev with whom 
she has met several times lauding him as a reformer of courage 
and vision but she is also cautious about his chances of 
completing the revolution he has unleashed 
therefore she continues to advocate a strong nato and opposes 
any changes in the present lineup of nato and warsaw pact forces 
lest they become ammunition for gorbachevs hardline foes 
her legislative program for 1990 pledges britain to uphold its 
nato obligations and sustain the united kingdoms contribution to 
western defense by maintaining adequate and effective nuclear and 
conventional forces 
the 64yearold prime minister is facing political troubles at 
home resurgent inflation and criticism of her combative leadership 
style have helped push her behind the opposition labor party in 
opinion polls 
on wednesday rankandfile lawmaker sir anthony meyer announced 
plans to challenge mrs thatcher for the leadership of the 
conservative party a position that has gone to her as a matter of 
formality during her 10 years in office 
meyer conceded he has no chance of success but said he hoped to 
send the prime minister a message of disenchantment and possibly 
lure a major contender into the race if it should go to a second 
round of voting 
mrs thatcher in an interview published today rebuffed the 
unprecedented challenge to her leadership saying she is ready to 
fight two more general elections 
the times of london quoted her as saying this week by popular 
acclaim in the party i am happy to carry on

dind who has reintroduced a bill in congress to change the 
anthem 
america the beautiful jacobs writes celebrates our power 
and our ability to live and work in peace the beauty that is in 
our land and the possibilities inherent in our people 
jacobs says he objects to the starspangled banner because 
it celebrates war and because its music was written in 
18thcentury england by john stafford smith as a sex and drinking 
song 
despite its stirring lyrics and melody the starspangled 
banner is also hard to sing referring to the words oer the 
land of the free and the home of the brave jacobs said i love 
that line even if i cant sing it 
he suggests keeping the starspangled banner for military 
ceremonies

americans consumption of hard liquor has fallen 
to its lowest level in three decades federal health researchers 
reported friday 
the national centers for disease control reported that 
percapita consumption of distilled spirits in 1986 the last year 
for which complete statistics are available was the lowest since 
1959 
the average american drank 085 gallons of spirits in 1986 the 
lowest since 1959s 084 gallons according to researcher darryl 
bertolucci of the alcohol drug abuse and mental health 
administration 
preliminary statistics indicate that the decline continued in 
1987 to 083 gallons bertolucci said 
distilled spirits are hard liquors such as whiskey rum vodka 
or gin beer and wine which are fermented but not distilled are 
considered separately however cdc statistics show that 
consumption of alcoholic beverages as a whole is on the decline 
in its weekly report the cdc said the drop in consumption of 
distilled spirits between 1985 and 1986 was the sharpest since 
1956 in terms of both actual cases sold and the percentage of the 
decrease exact statistics behind those findings were not available 
friday because of the holiday weekend 
the decline in spirits consumption may represent changes in 
the drinking patterns and preferences in the drinkingaged 
population the cdc said these changes were reflected by 
greater interest in beverages with reduced alcohol content light 
beers and wine coolers as well as increased public awareness 
regarding physical fitness nutrition and alcohol abuse 
percapita consumption of ethanol the actual alcohol in 
alcoholic beverages was 258 gallons from all beverages in 1986 
the lowest since 264 gallons in 1977 the cdc said 
two out of three american adults drink but a relatively small 
number of them account for most of the consumption of alcoholic 
beverages the cdc said 10 percent of drinkers or 65 percent of 
the us adult population account for half of all the alcohol 
consumed in the nation 
public health officials say average daily consumption of one 
ounce or more of ethanol about two beers cocktails or glasses of 
wine is heavy drinking and heavy drinkers run a seventimes 
greater risk of liver cirrhosis than nonheavy drinkers 
at least 46 percent of the cirrhosis deaths among us men and 
at least 15 percent of cirrhosis deaths among women is 
attributable to heavy drinking the cdc said 
the cdc reported friday that 26151 americans died of chronic 
liver disease and cirrhosis in 1986 42 percent of those deaths 
were associated with alcohol 
in another 13475 deaths chronic liver disease was a 
contributing cause among other causes the cdc said 
high rates of death from chronic liver disease were scattered 
across the country topped by 31 such deaths per 100000 residents 
in washington dc lowest was arkansas with six deaths per 
100000 people

the sandinista government has issued a 
visa for a new us embassy military attache in another quiet 
attempt to warm diplomatic relations between the two countries 
according to one source nicaragua recently offered to exchange 
ambassadors but the report could not be immediately confirmed 
both countries expelled each others ambassadors in july 1988 
along with seven other diplomatic officers apiece 
earlier this year both countries exchanged some junior 
diplomats only to engage shortly afterward in more expulsions 
on both occasions nicaragua accused us diplomats of plotting 
to destabilize the government 
us army lt col dennis quinn the new military attache 
arrived in nicaragua two weeks ago as soon as his visa was issued 
by the nicaragua government said a us embassy spokesman who 
spoke on condition his name not be used 
the nicaraguans didnt indicate the reason why they allowed 
him in the spokesman said 
quinn had been ready to take up his post in managua for more 
than eight months the spokesman said quinns predecessor us 
army lt col ray fernandez left in april 
this hasnt led to any fundamental change in the visa 
situation or restaffing of the embassy the spokesman said 
mercedes borge spokeswoman at the nicaragua foreign ministry 
said the nicaraguan government has not sent a military attache to 
its mission in washington 
a diplomatic source who demanded anonymity said victor hugo 
tinoco the nicaraguan deputy foreign minister met with us 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson in washington on nov 
18 and offered to exchange ambassadors 
tinoco had been in washington heading a delegation in peace 
talks with the usbacked contra rebels the talks collapsed 
tuesday 
no one at the foreign ministry was available to comment on the 
purported offer by tinoco 
us ambassador richard melton and seven other us embassy 
officers were expelled july 11 1988 after an opposition march in 
the town of nandaime ended in violent clashes between government 
forces and the marchers the sandinista government accused the 
united states of instigating the demonstration 
the us government retaliated expelling nicaraguan ambassador 
carlos tunnermann and seven other nicaraguan embassy officials from 
washington 
the expulsions kicked off a visa war with nicaragua 
establishing a rule requiring a 15day waiting period for visas for 
us diplomats washington stopped issuing visas to nicaraguans 
saying the decision was because of the reduction in its consular 
personnel in managua 
since then both embassies have been understaffed and run by 
junior officers 
in january in what the nicaragua government said was a sign of 
its good will nicaragua offered to stop the visa war within 
weeks managua and washington had issued each other visas to 
replace the junior diplomats expelled in july 1988 
but with the expulsion in may of the two us diplomats the visa 
war was on again

espinoza a check for 638881 his share of the reward for

the problem is that espinoza helped capture ramirez and then 
quietly slipped away 
nobody seems to know his whereabouts larry monteilh

monteilh said espinoza filed a claim for his share of the 
36777 reward but failed to include his address others who 
helped capture ramirez received their reward money earlier this 
week 
ramirez is in san quentin state prison he was sentenced nov 7 
to die in the gas chamber his sentence carried an automatic appeal 
the 29yearold selfdescribed devil worshiper was convicted of 
13 murders and 30 other felonies including rape burglary and 
sodomy 
authorities said espinoza helped police recover property taken 
from the homes of some of the night stalker victims

to the person to whom ramirez was selling stolen property said 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin that was a big break 
in the case

it was a strange type of anniversary 
but it was an anniversary of sorts for socialite mollie wilmot 
five years since a freighter crashed her seawall damaged her 
swimming pool and stuck around for 105 days 
im afraid the mercedes is with me for life the department 
store heiress and race horse breeder said this week 
even in new york ill be walking alone on some obscure 
street and someone will ask me any more ships in your back 
yard wilmot said as she cuddled her white pekingese fluff 
underneath the gazebo next to her renovated pool 
five years ago thursday when a maid jostled wilmot awake and 
summoned her to a window to see it she thought the rusting aging 
mercedes i an apparition then realized otherwise 
it was the most unusual thing and thats putting it mildly 
she said 
the mercedes remained grounded for the next 105 days due to 
mechanical problems and uncooperative weather 
wilmot acted as the unflagging gracious hostess to its frazzled 
crew police the coast guard state environmental officials and a 
throng of media types who barged into wilmots home next to the 
kennedy estate on north ocean boulevard 
there were mercedes tshirts that proclaimed i know mollie 
very well freightershaped chocolates a mercedes song that got 
air time and even a postcard a photo taken from a helicopter by 
some entrepreneur as many as 145000 of the postcards reportedly 
were sold in germany wilmot said 
the state department of natural resources got stuck for the 
220000 removal fee the money came out of floridas oil spill 
contingency fund and wilmots insurance picked up the tab for her 
damaged seawall and pool

and food aid they have given to poland and hungary more than 370 
million in food aid has been pledged to poland and more than 
onethird of that has been delivered the remainder will be sent by 
years end 
more is needed the ec commission said in a statement 
the commission put no price tag on the second food aid package 
under study but ec external relations commissioner frans 
andriessen suggested recently it should total at least 220 million 
the commission is coordinating an international aid effort for 
poland and hungary involving the 12 ec nations and a dozen other 
countries including the united states canada japan and australia 
most donor nations have lifted restrictions on polish and 
hungarian imports it said

65 billion in food and economic aid including 28 billion from 
the european community and 1 billion from the united states 
they offered this rough outline 
4438 million in food aid for poland

both poland and hungary 
470 million toward a currency stabilization fund for poland

a city council session called friday to mark the 
second anniversary of mayor harold washingtons death was scratched 
when only about a dozen of the citys 50 aldermen showed up 
while some attributed the low turnout to continued divisions on 
the council most called it a question of scheduling and said the 
citys first black mayor would be honored monday instead 
mayor richard daleys press secretary avis lavelle said notice 
was too short the gathering was announced by alderman robert shaw 
on wednesday afternoon 
daley has scheduled another memorial during mondays council 
meeting she said 
this is not some sinister plot lavelle said its a 
reality of the holiday season many people had longstanding 
vacation plans or arranged to take today off 
although shaw acknowledged that he didnt call for the gathering 
until 142 pm wednesday he blamed the lack of attendance on the 
city clerks office which is required by law to notify aldermen of 
meetings 
its ridiculous its ludicrous shaw huffed it smells 
like daley got his hand in the whole thing 
other aldermen milling around the council chambers after the 
meeting was canceled said the small turnout was unfortunate but 
not sinister 
i dont ascribe any racial motives to the failure of people to 
attend today said alderman timothy evans who was washingtons 
council floor leader and later ran against daley for mayor i 
suspect it has more to do with the timing 
washington died two years ago saturday after suffering a heart 
attack while working at his city hall desk 
his first term was marked by a split in the council between 
oldline machine democrats and a coalition of washington 
supporters the division stalled most of washingtons appointments 
and programs 
he forged a council coalition shortly before winning reelection 
in april 1987 
most on friday agreed council relations have progressed 
considerably since the acrimonious council wars that plagued 
much of washingtons administration 
the bridges that he built are still in place said evans 
washington left behind a legacy of respect for all segments of 
our society the clock on those activities can never be turned 
back he said 
certainly city government will not and can not operate as it 
had operated before mayor harold washington said alderman bobby 
rush the council has really become a legislative body 
but racial divisions continue to plague the council rush said 
race relations are still a very very serious problem we 
still have a long way to go 
members of washingtons family planned a private memorial 
service saturday at his gravesite

eleven journalists and one scientist were 
flown to chile on friday after being stranded for about two weeks 
in antarctica a spokeswoman for a south pole expedition announced 
the group had been been dropped off at a camp of the 
international transantarctic expedition on nov 8 and was 
supposed to be picked up about four days later but the 
expeditions plane was grounded when it ran low on fuel and it was 
forced to land on remote king george island off the west coast of 
antarctica 
with the plane finally refueled this week the dozen people were 
picked up and taken to the expeditions base in punta arenas 
chile spokeswoman cathy de moll said in st paul all were 
reported to be in good health 
the group had been flown to the camp in the patriot hills about 
830 miles from the south pole to meet with members of the 
expedition who had arrived on nov 7 en route to the pole the 
trekkers resumed their trip two days later and were reported to be 
453 miles from the south pole on friday 
however the planes repeated delays blamed on weather and 
technical problems have prompted concerns about the expeditions 
chances for finishing its 4000mile journey by early march before 
weather makes travel out of the area impossible 
the plane is needed to lay four more food caches in the 1000 
miles between the south pole and the soviet base of vostok 
the expedition led by will steger is making its sevenmonth 
journey to bring world attention to antarctica and to demonstrate 
the power of international cooperation the expeditions other 
members are from the soviet union france great britain japan and 
china 
despite high waves of ice the team has averaged 24 miles a day 
during the past week and may take a day off when it reaches its 
next food cache expected sunday de moll said 
all food caches beyond vostok are already in place but for the 
team to finish its trip de moll said it must arrive at vostok 
before temperatures drop below minus50 degrees and from there 
complete the remaining 860 miles before winds hit 150 mph and all 
transportation off the continent becomes impossible in early march 
as weather conditions and maintenance of the airplane make 
this schedule extremely tight expedition managers are 
investigating all other possible options including recalculating 
what essentials must be transported hiring additional planes and a 
parachute drop of 50 barrels of fuel at the south pole by soviet 
aircraft de moll said 
were working on combining every possible solution and we are 
confident that with everybodys help we can pull it off she 
said this should be interpreted by no one as a sign of giving 
up 
the group that had been stranded at the patriot hills camp 
included three french film crew members one australian television 
journalist one french still photographer one french television 
journalist two german magazine journalists two members of an abc 
sports crew one us print reporter and one saudi arabian

vice premier shimon peres was quoted friday as 
saying his leftleaning labor party will resign from israels 
governing coalition unless more progress is made in middle east 
peace efforts 
peres remarks contrasted with upbeat comments from prime 
minister yitzhak shamir who returned from a visit to the united 
states france and italy and said he had succeeded in relieving 
pressure on israel to speak to the plo 
in jerusalem a homemade bomb was found outside the home of a 
surgeon who transplanted the heart of an israeli soldier killed by 
arab guerrillas into a palestinian a person called two newspapers 
and claimed responsibility on behalf of rightwing jewish 
extremists 
in other unrest troops shot and wounded 17 palestinians 
including a 9yearold and two 12yearold boys during clashes in 
the occupied gaza strip arab reports said the army confirmed one 
wounding and said it was checking the other reports 
in his latest threat to topple the government peres said 
shamirs talks in washington paris and rome did not change 
anything in the negotiations process army radio said 
if the likud continues to be obstinate there is a doubt labor 
will sit with it in one government peres reportedly said 
referring to the rightwing party shamir heads 
the uneasy likudlabor alliance was forged after inconclusive 
parliamentary elections last year peres has repeatedly said he 
would dissolve the partnership unless shamir succeeded in starting 
peace talks with palestinians 
the parties are divided over what concessions to make for peace 
labor advocates withdrawing from some occupied lands while likud 
objects to that 
neither party has a majority in parliament with likud and labor 
holding 40 and 39 seats respectively in the 120member legislature 
if labor resigns it would likely mean early national elections 
which are currently scheduled for 1992 
shamir who spoke to reporters after his plane landed at ben 
gurion international airport near tel aviv claimed he had advanced 
his proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories as part 
of an interim plan for selfrule for palestinians 
he said president bush and baker assured him during meetings in 
washington in a clear and unambiguous way that the us would not 
ask israel to negotiate with the plo 
regarding his talks in europe shamir said he hoped to overcome 
continued french and italian demands that israel negotiate with the 
plo if we do not succeed in convincing them we can at least 
weaken their opposition shamir said 
palestinians have balked at agreeing to elections because the 
israeli plan omits a role for the plo and fails to guarantee 
eventual statehood in the occupied lands 
in jerusalem police spokesman uzi sandori said a makeshift bomb 
rigged inside a seltzer bottle was found outside the home of dr 
dov simon who transplanted the heart of soldier zeev traum into 
palestinian hanna khader on nov 15 traum had died of a gunshot 
wound suffered in the gaza strip two days earlier 
an anonymous caller to the yediot and haariv dailies friday 
claimed a rightwing group called the sicarites planted the bomb 
and another left outside the home of a jerusalem professor who 
invited a palestinian activists to speak at hebrew university 
if they do not leave the country within a week we will wait 
for them in a dark corner with a machine gun maariv quoted the 
caller as saying

the government friday declared 
four neighborhoods in the country open to all races easing a 
39yearold policy of strict residential segregation 
i hope this will be proof of the governments serious attempt 
to normalize a lot of situations in our country said planning 
minister hernus kriel 
it was the latest in a series of acts by president fw de klerk 
aimed at reducing racial friction in south africa 
the farright conservative party which favors rigid 
segregation condemned the decision 
mr de klerk ignores the existence of white community life 
and draws a line through the traditional way of life and ideals by 
which whites have lived for centuries in this country said jh 
van der merwe a member of parliament for the conservatives 
the conservative party warns mr de klerk once again urgently 
not to try to suppress the ability of whites to resist 
de klerk who assumed office in august said he favors selected 
multiracial neighborhoods but will maintain segregated schools and 
residential districts for whites who want them 
the four newly integrated neighborhoods are district six in cape 
town a downtown section in the indian ocean city of durban a 
thinly populated suburban area between johannesburg and pretoria 
and a small part of boksburg an industrial city east of 
johannesburg 
de klerk on thursday proclaimed that people of any race may own 
businesses in boksburg overruling the councils effort to restrict 
ownership to whites 
antiapartheid activists said opening only small free 
settlement areas will lead to overcrowding due to the acute 
housing shortage in black townships nationwide 
while welcoming any move away from racially zoned areas we 
cannot admit to being ecstatic said cas coovadia of actstop a 
group that has fought residential segregation 
coovadia said the move was an attempt to amend rather than 
repeal the group areas act which has formally segregated all 
neighborhoods by race since 1950 
district six within walking distance of downtown cape town was 
a ragged but lively multiracial neighborhood until the government 
declared it a whitesonly area in 1966 and renamed it 
zonnebloem about 40000 nonwhites were forced out and all the 
buildings were razed except for churches and mosques 
so deep is the bitterness created by the evictions that few cape 
town whites or businesses have sought any part of the area and it 
remains an empty field 
the multiracial durban neighborhood is made up mostly of aging 
downtown apartment buildings where some blacks already live 
the area between johannesburg and durban has few residents but 
is expected to become a middleclass development 
boksburg has drawn international attention since the farright 
conservative party won control of the town council last year and 
began reimposing strict apartheid 
the neighborhood that will be open to all races has fewer than 
50 houses and many already are owned by indian families 
in another development friday a whitesonly public school for 
girls that faced closure because it had too few students will 
become a multiracial private school officials said 
education officials this year said they planned to close the 
102yearold johannesburg girls high school because enrollment 
dropped to 200 students or onethird of capacity 
teachers parents and students launched a campaign to keep the 
school open and said they would welcome black and indian students 
to help increase enrollment

theres only one thing worse than 
spending hours shopping in a crowded noisy department store on one 
of the busiest days of the holiday shopping season working there 
i found out the hard way 
i knew it was going to be busy in my day at the younkers 
department store when i saw the parking lot at merle hay mall 
filling up and the shoppers crowding into the lobby just outside 
the sales floor more than a quarterhour before the stores early 8 
am opening 
back in my hometown of philadelphia merchants and commissioned 
sales clerks have a real lovehate relationship with the official 
kickoff of the christmas shopping countdown they call it black 
friday for the sea of heads and the ungodly congestion in the 
malls and parking lots 
ive always avoided even shopping then because journalists 
usually work on holidays this year i avoided the shopping but not 
the crowds 
one sore back two aching feet four long hours and about a 
hundred customers later i thankfully went back to my real job 
i was plunked behind the costume jewelrywatch counter in 
accessories and given a few tips about where the gift boxes were 
and what was on sale by the time my fiveminute orientation was 
over customers were peering into display cases all around me and 
asking me questions within a few more minutes the rush was so 
constant there wasnt even time to visit the restroom 
most of the shoppers were nice particularly the ones excited 
about finding just the right gift but there were those who made me 
finally understand why its hard to be the alwayspolite smiling 
sales clerk there will always be people who make you want to be 
anything but that 
such as the lady who ignored her 8yearold leaving me to chase 
the girl out from behind our cash register and glare at her as she 
went around a display of earrings gleefully snapping shut all the 
hinged jewelry boxes my fellow clerks had so carefully arranged 
or the woman whose son wanted a popswatch a watch with a face 
that pops out of the case something i didnt know existed until 
friday he picked out the first one he tried and said he was sure 
it was what he wanted mom didnt like it made me pull out every 
other style and then said theyd have to think it over and steered 
her disappointed son away leaving me to put away all those 
popswatches 
or the dozens buying gifts who didnt really know what the 
receiver would like leaving me to use my esp to find just the 
right item i ended up encouraging everybody to buy exactly what i 
liked mainly so i wouldnt be tempted to spend a lot of money when 
i finally knocked off for the afternoon 
and of course there were the people who chose black friday to 
return items theyd bought a week before and the lady who bought a 
watch and returned it in five minutes because shed already seen 
something else she liked better 
then there were all the people leaving cracker jacks in boxes 
and loose all over our oncespotless counters they had been 
given the boxes at the door as part of a special sale each box 
held a coupon for an extra discount of 10 to 20 percent off one 
item or for a free shopping spree the gimmick drew lots of 
shoppers but it didnt do much for the condition of the floors

a barge that was adrift south of prince 
william sound with more than 5 million gallons of jet fuel on board 
resumed its tow to anchorage on friday after an inspection revealed 
no damage to the vessel 
the 400foot barge was towed out of port etches on hinchinbrook 
island by the same tug which lost it in rough weather tuesday in 
the gulf of alaska 
the tow cable which was new and had been installed just a week 
earlier should have held despite the weather said dick simpson a 
spokesman for the barge and tug owner crowley maritime corp of 
san francisco 
it had a breaking strength of 500000 pounds which is twice 
what you normally need simpson said 
commissioner dennis kelso of the state department of 
environmental conservation praised the coast guard for avoiding a 
potentially major spill had the barge drifted 12 more hours it 
likely would have hit a reef or island at the entrance to prince 
william sound the coast guard said 
the barge broke loose about 90 miles southeast of the sound 
where the tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
oil march 24 in the worst oil spill in us history 
the weather in the area tuesday included winds up to 92 mph and 
2030 foot swells which had not been forecast simpson said 
its normally the kind of weather we would have skirted but 
the skipper found himself in the middle of it and tried to make the 
best of it he said the crew of a coast guard plane found the 
barge wednesday and a helicopter dropped a radio buoy onto the 
vessel to help the tug find it the tug reconnected to the barge by 
early thursday and it was towed to port etches 
an army ordnance team had been placed on standby to blow up the 
barge and burn the fuel before the vessel could run aground 
anytime you have a separation you have a potential danger 
simpson said but we had a contingency plan and it was under 
control 
the barge which originated at cherry point wash resumed the 
final 360 miles of its trip and was scheduled to arrive sunday 
morning with the fuel destined for anchorage international airport

prosecutors on friday 
indicted a former provincial communist party chief and 14 other 
ethnic albanians on charges of instigating unrest that left 25 
people dead in southern yugoslavia 
police ringed the courthouse in this kosovo mining town 120 
miles south of the capital belgrade while azem vlasi and the others 
were formally indicted there were fears of new unrest by ethnic 
albanians many of whom consider 42yearold vlasi their leader 
also friday the government tanjug news agency said former 
yugoslav vice president fadil hoxha also has been charged with 
fanning ethnic albanian nationalism in kosovo province by publicly 
making insulting comments about nonalbanians in the province 
it said hoxha a close associate of the late president josip 
broz tito who served as the countrys no 2 leader in the late 
1970s will be tried in the kosovo town of prizren for comments he 
allegedly made in november 1986 if convicted he faces a maximum 
10year prison sentence 
in the court in titova mitrovica authorities read a 99page 
indictment of vlasi and the 14 others that charged them with 
counterrevolutionary activities in connection with rioting by 
ethnic albanians in kosovo in february and march 
prosecutor spasoje zamfirovic reading the indictment said they 
destroyed the brotherhood and unity of yugoslavias ethnically 
disparate peoples authorities later adjourned the proceedings for 
a week 
ethnic albanians make up about 85 percent of the 19 million 
people in kosovo an adminstrative part of the republic of serbia 
the riots were sparked by constitutional changes opposed by vlasi 
that gave serbia tighter judicial and police control over the 
province 
at least three ethnic albanians who protested the trial when it 
opened oct 30 died in violent clashes with police last month 
officials and the media in the western yugoslav republics of 
slovenia and croatia and international human rights organizations 
have denounced the proceedings as a show trial staged by the 
serbian leadership to intimidate ethnic albanians in kosovo 
authorities in serbia and kosovo have consistently denied the 
trial is political 
louise christian a lawyer representing the parisbased 
international federation for human rights was barred by security 
officials from monitoring the trial 
vlasi who was ousted as provincial party chief last year is 
accused of secretly visiting ethnic albanian miners who staged 
an eightday sitin at a nearby mine in february to protest the 
adoption of the constitutional changes

president bush and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher discussed the nato alliance amid rapid east bloc 
changes friday and were described as in very close accord 
as he prepared for his talks next week with soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
on an issue of crucial concern to western allies in europe 
the two leaders agreed on the need for european stability as nato 
faces the changes in eastern europe presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said after the 4hour meeting 
mrs thatcher told reporters after the talks that nato is 
absolutely vital for continued defense of europe she said the 
allies have agreed on a strategy of dont disarm too fast so 
that neither their security nor our security is in jeopardy thats 
absolutely vital 
like bush she sought to play down the importance of results 
from the summit next weekend i dont think there will be a great 
deal of difficulty or sudden surprises she said at a press 
conference in washington 
fitzwater said that among other topics the president and 
prime minister discussed reforms under way in the soviet union and 
agreed on support for glasnost and perestroika new soviet 
openness and economic restructuring they both emphasized the 
pursuit of democracy as the first step in the reform process in 
talking of eastwest relations and european stability he said 
the two leaders joined by advisers talked on a snowswept day 
at bushs country retreat where the president and his family are 
spending a long thanksgiving holiday weekend 
im just interested in getting the views of the prime minister 
on the rapid changes in eastern europe and the strength of the 
alliance and everything else so weve got a good full agenda 
bush told reporters after mrs thatcher arrived by helicopter 
mrs thatcher in her news conference later described their talks 
as very relaxed very valuable 
bush lightly clad in a sports jacket against the frigid 
temperatures and mrs bush in a down jacket along with their 
daughter dorothy leblond greeted mrs thatcher and her entourage 
and then drove in golf carts to their house 
bush told mrs thatcher im so glad youre here this is so 
timely an apparent reference to summit talks with gorbachev next 
weekend on ships in the mediterranean off the coast of malta 
mrs thatcher had been expected to emphasize her view that the 
thaw in western relations with the soviet union and the moves 
toward democratic reform in eastern europe should not lead to a 
weakening of the nato defensive posture 
bush said earlier this week that he too was committed to 
allied strength and would seek consultation with allied leaders 
he plans to go to brussels to report to those leaders on the way 
back from the summit off the coast of malta 
fitzwater said that during the meeting with mrs thatcher bush 
summarized plans for the malta meeting 
in addition he said they discussed regional issues including 
the mideast peace process lebanon china cambodia central 
america afghanistan and others 
the two leaders were in very close accord in their examination 
of all the issues discussed today said fitzwater 
also the white house announced friday that bush will meet with 
president francois mitterrand of france on dec 16 in the 
caribbean to discuss his meeting with gorbachev and other issues 
french officials said the two leaders would meet on the island of 
st martin 
while extending an offer to gorbachev to work together to end 
the cold war bush said wednesday night that he would not make any 
moves during the talks that would surprise the allies 
the prospect of ussoviet talks against a backdrop of 
encouraging signs across east europe has produced jitters from some 
quarters in europe that the superpowers might work out a deal to 
cut back on nato and warsaw pact forces 
bush has repeatedly sought to allay those fears in recent days 
he said in an interview with foreign journalists this week that he 
is prepared to think anew about reducing us troop levels 
abroad in light of eastern europes changes but wont act without 
the allies 
im not suggesting that forevermore well have the same levels 
of troops anywhere standing army europe korea anywhere else 
but were certainly not going to take any unilateral action he 
said pledging to act in conjunction with our allies 
asked by reporters at camp david if she and bush had different 
views on nato strength mrs thatcher replied emphatically no 
none 
in the latest development in eastern europe onetime reform 
leader alexander dubcek returned triumphantly to prague and 
czechoslovakias communist party the politburo and the rest of the 
communist leadership resigned friday after a week of massive 
prodemocracy protests according to the staterun media 
mrs thatcher told reporters she hoped to see czechoslovakia 
become a democracy but the wish is not the deed and it does take 
quite a long time to get all the democratic structures into place 
and they must be genuine structures not just a facade 
her us visit comes against a backdrop of political troubles at 
home with inflation and criticism of her combative leadership 
style taking a toll

after nearly 20 years in virtual 
seclusion alexander dubcek triumphantly returned friday to the 
cheers of 300000 antigovernment protesters urging the rebirth of 
changes crushed by warsaw pact tanks in 1968 
the din of hundreds of thousands of voices chanting dubcek 
dubcek and long live dubcek reverberated like a deafening 
ocean wave throughout wenceslas square as the ousted reformist 
leader took to the microphone 
the noise subsided into a hushed almost ghostly silence as the 
crowd waited for dubcek to utter his first words in public in 
prague since 1969 
im glad to be among you dubcek 67 told the flagwaving 
crowd i love you and you know it 
the ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the 
minds of a new generation dubcek declared using a catch phrase 
of his doomed prague spring attempts to reform communism 21 years 
ago 
candles in the windows of the historic 19thcentury gabled 
buildings along the square glittered in the cold dusk lighted to 
show solidarity with the burgeoning prodemocracy movement that has 
surged triumphantly through czechoslovakia in the past week 
homemade banners mocking the communist leadership one bearing 
a cartoon with the caption dinsosaurs they also had small 
brains flapped in the cold wind as protesters pressed to get a 
glimpse of dubcek at a balcony window 
for more than an hour the throng cheered whistled shook small 
bells furiously and rattled keys in approval as speaker after 
speaker called for democratic reform and an end to comunist party 
monopoly rule 
after the rally ended czechoslovakias official news agency 
reported that party chief milos jakes and the rest of the hardline 
leadership had resigned karel urbanek a politburo member and 
former party leader of the czech republic was elected to replace 
jakes 
for many like dubcek the return to prague was a triumphant and 
emotional journey after two decades of forced political exile and 
disgrace at the hands of the communist party leaders 
until the dramatic developments of the past week dubcek has 
lived in relative obscurity in the slovak capital of bratislava he 
worked as a lowlevel employee of the state forestry services 
after his expulsion from the communist party in june 1970 he 
was watched roundtheclock until soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev visited czechoslovakia in spring 1987 
still under surveillance but freer to act and move dubcek 
carefully redeveloped contacts with former comrades and with 
prominent dissidents 
he gave cautious interviews to western media as well as soviet 
and hungarian tv moves that prompted sharp comment to moscow and 
budapest from hardline leaders in prague 
last year in italy to receive an honorary doctorate dubcek 
delivered a ringing defense of the prague spring 
but it was not until thursday in bratislava that dubcek was 
able to return to the public political stage in his own country on 
friday his return was complete 
again after a longer time i appear before you and thus 
before all our people who once again raised their voices for a 
renewal of society a renewal of our unbreakable community of our 
nations which are so close and related by blood he said 
this mutual bond is also today a pillar of the present 
democratic renewal our inseparable and indivisible fatherland of 
our two nations czechoslovakia

following as translated from 
slovak by the associated press are excerpts of alexander dubceks 
speech to 300000 people on wenceslas square friday he refers to 
the two nations of czechoslovakia a country formed by czech lands 
and slovakia 
dear popular meeting my dear residents of prague i love you 
you know that but i will tell you just the same i am happy to be 
with you 
again after a longer time i appear before you and thus before 
all our people who once again raised their voices for a renewal of 
society a renewal of our unbreakable community of our nations 
which are so close and related by blood this mutual bond is also 
today a pillar of the present democratic renewal our inseparable 
and indivisible fatherland of our two nations czechoslovakia 
yesterday at the square in bratislava a crowd of more than 
100000 people met in the spirit of solidarity of popular civic 
initiative which unites us in this historic elation we all know 
that the present state of crisis in the country was caused by 
violent military intervention in the affairs and life which have 
belonged to the people of this country only for this reason 
departure from this unhappy legacy and from the whole socalled 
policy of normalization and its birth is unconditional and brooks 
no delay 
this is clearly expressed by the attitudes of all civic 
movements of former communist party members who have been 
expelled of youth artists and cultural movements yesterday in 
bratislava and today again here 
i see this movement has found support in the working class 
among peasants in all strata of the working people 
the broad and complex stream of todays great movement should 
converge into a joint stream which will once again elevate the 
initiative of the people our country to a place it rightly has in 
europe 
today the new civic forum is being formed with the platform of 
a new socialist renewal i declare that i stand by this platform 
and give it my voice before the citizens of prague and all working 
people 
people of prague in unity with all the people played an 
important part in the renewal of socialism 21 years ago 
i say this because the working class peoples militias with 
the sympathies of our army and police stood sidebyside i say 
this that today too these forces should stand on the side of the 
people do not act against the people you are a part of it 
remember you are from the people 
the ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the minds 
of a new generation 
dont give way to extremist trends so that the peoples 
movement can be crowned with success and reflect the cultural level 
of this nation 
an old wise man said if once there was light why should 
there be darkness again we had lived in darkness for too long 
let us act in such a way to bring the light back again

president hosni mubarak in remarks 
published friday blamed foreign forces for the plight of egyptian 
laborers working in iraq and accused the cairo news media of 
exaggerating reports about the workers problems 
mubarak did not specify what foreign elements might be involved 
nor did he mention the deaths of scores of egyptians in iraq 
cairo airport officials have said the bodies of about 100 
egyptian laborers arrived from iraq in october and 50 more in the 
first half of this month they said those figures compared to a 
previous montly average of 1015 
in many cases iraqi certificiates listed violence as the cause 
of death 
thousands of egyptians have returned from iraq in recent months 
some said many of the egyptian workers were killed in fights with 
iraqis over jobs after tens of thousands of iraqi soldiers were 
demobilized following last years ceasefire ending the 
eightyearold war with iran 
egypts governmentrun middle east news agency quoted mubarak as 
saying thursday that iraqi president saddam hussein is among the 
most sympathetic people toward egyptians 
i reproach our own media for unduly widening the gap 
mubarak said the truth is there have been mistakes made by iraq 
as well as egyptian individuals 
there are many who do not want our relations with iraq to be 
strong and sustained he said before formation of the arab 
cooperation council we expected there would be many external 
forces that did not want that kind of agreement 
egypt iraq jordan and north yemen formed the council last 
februay its main purpose is coordination of economic policies 
the agency said mubarak praised iraq for being responsive to 
egyptian questions about the egyptian workers and expressed 
understanding of iraqs financial difficulties after the war 
it is estimated that up to 2 million egyptian workers are in 
iraq but officials at cairo airport said more than 30000 have 
returned home since nov 1 they complained to the cairo news media 
of insulting treatment by iraqi employers arbitrary dismissals and 
steep cuts in the amounts of money they could send back to their 
families 
makram mohamed ahmed editor of the governmentowned weekly 
almussawar and a mubarak confidant said in an article that 975 
bodies of egyptian workers were brought back from iraq since the 
beginning of this year other reports placed the number at more 
than 1000 
ahmed said the number of dead may be normal in relation to the 
number of egyptians in iraq 
iraq said shortages of hard currency forced the dismissals of 
some workers and delays of remittances by egyptian employees of 
their families reports estimate that the backlog of remittances 
amounts to about 370 million 
remittances have been delayed and we know the reasons behind 
this mubarak said we are solving the problem with our iraqi 
brothers 
last week iraq announced it planned to free 50 million to 
finance egyptian remittances until the end of the year

neutral switzerland decides in a referendum on 
sunday whether to disband the countrys army 
even supporters admit the proposal is headed for certain defeat 
but if it gains close to 30 percent of the national vote as some 
pollsters predict it is bound to send shock waves throughout the 
military establishment 
the government says swiss neutrality and independence can be 
guaranteed only if this mountain nation of 64 million people 
retains a credible defense force it urges voters to reject the 
proposed constitutional amendment which simply proclaims that 
switzerland has no army 
the 625000member reserve force which can be mobilized in less 
than 48 hours is rooted in centuriesold tradition 
although switzerland has not fought a foreign war since 1515 it 
can field more soldiers per square acre than any other country in 
europe it has more artillery pieces than west germany and half the 
number of tanks france has 
every fit man must do military service starting with 17 weeks 
of basic training at age 20 followed by 13 callups of two or 
three weeks until age 50 
the proposal to abolish the army by the year 2000 was launched 
three years ago when pacifists and leftwingers collected the 
100000 signatures required to force a popular vote under 
switzerlands form of direct democracy 
the switzerland without an army movement says this small 
country would stand no chance in a war and abolishing the army 
would set an example for global peace 
movement spokesman andreas gross a 37yearold political 
scientist concedes that traditionally conservative swiss voters 
will not accept the initiative but he says the proposal has 
injected a new dynamism into swiss politics 
fierce debate on the issue filled newspaper letters pages for 
weeks a sports magazine canvassed leading athletes on their views 
abolition of the army abolition of the police 
abolition of the state anarchy and moblaw would take over 
predicted walter krebs 
our existence is threatened by environmental catastrophy 
drugs and climate change we cannot meet these threats with weapons 
on the battlefield we must realize that we do not face a real 
enemy any more we are our own enemy countered therese dubach on 
the same page of the zurich daily tagesanzeiger 
reaction from abroad has also been varied according to a survey 
last sunday by the newspaper sonntagsblick 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg told the paper 
despite improved eastwest relations every country needs a sound 
defense policy 
but juri soldatenko a disarmament specialist in the soviet 
army was quoted as saying switzerland has no enemies 
therefore abolition of the swiss army would not have a 
destabilizing influence on europe 
no comment was the official reaction from president bush 
said the newspaper 
three of the four parties in the swiss coalition government 
oppose the proposal the fourth the social democrats is taking no 
stance on the issue 
a second vote on sunday will determine if speed limits should be 
raised on major swiss highways from 120 to 130 kilometers per hour 
75 to 81 mph and on main roads from 80 to 100 kph 50 to 62 mph 
the government urged voters to keep the present limits citing 
environmental and safety factors

the fisher park golf course is a bogy for 
linda rodvold 
lousy golfers on the cityowned par3 course are endangering 
the lives of ms rodvold and her family she contends so she is 
trying to shut the course down using 1087 golf balls collected on 
their property over the past five years to buttress her case 
we live in a war zone and we cant even defend ourselves 
she said friday 
although fairway property may be attractive to some people ms 
rodvold said ducking duffers slices and hooks is a big handicap 
backyard barbecues and badminton are out of the question she said 
the problem is third hole at fisher park a 9hole course 
nestled in a middleclass neighborhood of this central washington 
city 
the rodvolds property sits across the street less than 50 
yards to the left of the green golfers teeing off on the 144yard 
hole routinely send balls careening into the familys yard ms 
rodvold contends 
her scorecard so far includes 22 dents in family vehicles seven 
windows shattered on the house and garage and three car 
windshields destroyed 
weve asked the prosecutor to close the course she said 
that is no place for a golf course to be in a residential area 
there was no answer at the golf course or at the county 
prosecutors office friday as many government agencies remained 
closed for thanksgiving 
but dave flaherty manager of the city park and recreation 
department said recently he does not believe the problem is as 
serious as the rodvolds maintain 
we have tried to be accommodating he said adding that the 
tee has been adjusted three times to try to solve the problem 
last spring a city employee charted activity on the third hole 
and found that of 2356 tee shots only six landed beyond the 
6foot fence ringing the course 
one is too many if it kills one of us ms rodvold said so 
far neither she her husband or their 10yearold son has been hit 
by a ball 
last month the family won a civil lawsuit against the golf 
course receiving 2500 for property damage and 3700 for the 
disruption of their quietude of domicile 
superior court judge bruce p hanson did not rule the course a 
public nuisance though so the 27yearold course is still open 
and golf balls keep landing in the rodvolds yard 128 times so 
far this year they say 
neighbors dont appear to be bothered kurt weingarten who 
lives a block away from the rodvolds on the edge of course said he 
finds about one ball a week on his property but hasnt suffered any 
damage 
i dont know anybody upset about it he said a lot of 
people would rather have the park than something else come in 
not the rodvolds they have asked county prosecutors to file 
criminal charges against the city for 1087 counts of reckless 
endangerment and 1087 counts of criminal trespass by people and 
golf balls she said thats one count for every ball the family 
has confiscated since 1985 often in the face of threats from their 
irate owners she said 
the family bought the house in 1984 from ms rodvolds 
grandparents unaware of the problem 
they were here before the golf course and this house was here 
before the golf course she said

lastminute management contract offer on friday the first day of a 
strike avoiding concert cancellations this weekend 
the players 1201 am strike deadline passed after an offer

200000

law friday that would restrict union peasant and human rights 
groups by imposing long prison terms for many of their customary 
activities

decadelong civil war 
also friday officials said a key witness in last weeks 
massacre of six jesuit priests and two other people has fled to 
miami after hiding in the spanish embassy 
under the proposed laws prison sentences of up to 20 years 
would be possible for those who participate in peaceful sitins or 
takeovers of buildings people blocking traffic with marches or 
demonstrations could be jailed for five years 
in a revision of another section of the penal code the proposal 
would provide prison terms of up to 30 years for murder 
kidnapping armed assault or sabotage intended to provoke a state 
of terror 
a provision that could affect the press prescribes sentences of 
up to four years for spreading propaganda that subverts the 
public order

office then put it aside in the face of domestic and foreign 
criticism 
when he learned the proosals had been revived lutheran bishop 
medardo gomez a member of a national committee seeking 
negotiations to end the war said democracy in el salvador had been

a bomb squad found a time bomb in a 
school bag taken from a saudi jumbo jet on friday and said only a 
loose battery wire kept it from blowing up the boeing 747 over the 
arabian sea with 248 people aboard 
airport security officers said authorities ordered the jet to 
land in karachi thursday night following a 15 million extortion 
threat 
it was a high explosive and would have destroyed the terminal 
building of karachi airport in addition to the plane said a 
commander of the paramilitary karachi airport security force 
he like most other officials spoke on the condition of 
anonymity they did not disclose the weight of the device or other 
specifications 
security officers said they questioned all those aboard they 
made no arrests and declined to say if they had any suspects or 
whether any group claimed responsibility 
saudi arabian airlines flight 367 was bound from islamabad 
capital of pakistan to riyadh the saudi capital 
security officials said a cab driver delivered an envelope to an 
islamabad airport security officer soon after the jet took off 
around 6 pm thursday 
inside was an unsigned note threatening to blow up the plane 
unless a demand for 15 million was met they said 
the aircraft was over the sea when the karachi control tower 
relayed the threat and ordered it to land at karachi officers 
said it touched down shortly after 8 pm they said 
after the airliner was emptied of passengers and luggage 
officers found the bomb early friday in an untagged unclaimed 
school bag 
we have recovered a bomb in a bag which was not tagged said 
a security force officer who gave the single name ashraf 
we have handed it over to the bomb disposal squad to get 
details on the type of explosive 
authorities said the discovery initially was kept secret to help 
their investigation 
they said the bomb was set to go off at 720 pm when the 
aircraft was over water but that a battery apparently had jarred 
loose detaching a wire 
officials said they could not immediately reconcile the 
extortion note with the bombs apparently having been rigged to go 
off automatically 
col noor khan of the islamabad airport security force said it 
was unclear how the bomb got past security there 
its not understood how they did it everything is there and 
working he said of security devices

a prominent moslem said friday he will make a 
middle east lecture tour to campaign for lifting of irans death 
threat against british author salman rushdie 
a price on his head is below the dignity of the iranian 
government it belongs to gangster movies and westerns said 
hesham elessawy chairman of the islamic society for the promotion 
of religious tolerance 
essawy a london dentist helped found the society in 1982 he 
said it has a membership of scholars and leading moslems in britain 
as well as nonmoslems committed to tolerance 
the london newspaper the independent quoted essawy as saying the 
rushdie affair harmed britains moslem community by encouraging a 
backlash that in turn stimulated extremism among moslems 
he intends to speak throughout egypt and the persian gulf states 
in february and hopes to visit iran if its government guarantees 
his safety 
essawy said he would quote from the koran islams holy book to 
support his argument that moslems should ignore rushdies novel 
the satanic verses which some moslem religious leaders 
denounce as blasphemous 
the koran has verses that actually fit the situation exactly 
if unbelievers or hypocrites mock or insult the word of god do not 
sit with them until they talk about something else essawy said 
he said he also was incensed by the novel but that irans late 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini should not have called for 
rushdies death last feb 14 
khomeinis action drove the 42yearold indianborn writer into 
hiding two iranian clerics offered rewards totaling 52 million 
for rushdies death 
at least 19 people were killed in riots over the book in india

a settlement rolling back some illinois 
restrictions on abortion clinics bars the state from taking certain 
steps to limit access to the procedure in the future a party to 
the agreement said friday 
under the settlement access to abortions could not be 
restricted either by materially increasing the cost of the 
procedure or materially reducing the number of facilities without 
resulting in more than a marginal increase in safety said jay a 
miller executive director of the american civil liberties union of 
illinois 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan and the illinois aclu 
agreed to the settlement wednesday to resolve a lawsuit by rockford 
physician dr richard ragsdale who objected to regulations 
requiring abortion clinics to be equipped and staffed like small 
hospitals 
the us supreme court had been prepared to hear arguments early 
next month in the case which some abortion opponents hoped might 
be used to help overturn the landmark 1973 roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortion 
clinics that perform abortions on women more than 18 weeks 
pregnant still will have to comply with the stringent state rules 
which are designed to offset the higher risk of ending a pregnancy 
relatively late miller said 
but clinics that perform abortions on women during the first 18 
weeks of pregnancy upward of 95 percent of abortions will be 
freed from stupid kinds of regulations that dont protect 
patients health under the settlement he said 
jerry bruce a spokesman for a coalition of antiabortion 
groups called the settlement unconscionable and 
unconstitutional and said heading off a supreme court decision on 
the case was a total sellout 
ragsdale had maintained that the state regulations were a veiled 
attempt to hinder womens access to abortion illinois had argued 
that the rules were necessary to protect womens health 
one requirement stricken under the settlement mandated that 
patients receive counseling about birth control and adoption and 
that counselors be people who derive no profit from abortions 
miller said 
also changed was a requirement that all abortion clinics go 
through a public hearing process and obtain a certificate of 
need from the state verifying that they do not duplicate similar 
services in their areas clinics performing abortions before the 
18th week of pregnancy would be freed from that requirement under 
the settlement miller said 
dr bernard j turnock director of the illinois department of 
public health said wednesday that state officials hope to resume 
inspections of abortion clinics next year to make sure they adhere 
to the proposed new state regulations 
well be in these facilities four times a year at a 
minimum to assure their continued compliance said turnock who 
noted that officials had been barred from inspecting abortion 
clinics since 1985 when ragsdale won a preliminary injunction

federal health officials said friday they have 
found statistically significant evidence that the nutritional 
supplement ltryptophan causes a painful blood disorder now 
reported in 427 cases and at least one death 
the studies appear to have very strongly linked the actual 
taking of these tablets and capsules with the disease centers 
for disease control researcher dr henry falk said it now seems 
extraordinarily likely that taking ltryptophan causes the blood 
disorder he said 
the disorder known as eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome brings an 
abnormally high number of white blood cells called eosinophils and 
causes severe muscle pain or myalgia 
ltryptophan is a building block of protein which is found 
naturally in a number of foods pills and capsules containing doses 
of the substance are taken by some people for insomnia depression 
premenstrual syndrome or weight control 
since reports of ltryptophan and the blood disorder surfaced in 
new mexico several weeks ago hundreds of case reports have come 
into the cdc with most cases occurring after july of this year 
falk said 
a 58yearold new york woman who died from the disorder in 
september is the first confirmed fatality in the outbreak and 
several other deaths are still under investigation in other states 
falk said 
the cdc report said the new york woman had been taking 5 to 6 
grams of ltryptophan daily 
the atlantabased cdc in its weekly report cited studies in 
new mexico and minnesota which establish a statistically 
significant association between the product and the disease 
in new mexico each of 12 blooddisorder patients studied from 
may 1nov 11 had used ltryptophan in minnesota another 12 cases 
were investigated and again all had used ltryptophan 
the studies show a causal relationship said falk director 
of the cdcs environmental hazards and health effects division 
we dont yet know what exactly about those tablets and capsules 
has caused the disease 
the disease has now been reported in 43 states and the district 
of columbia the number of ltryptophan users nationwide remains 
unknown but it appears to be large falk said 
some of the first potential cases of ltryptophanrelated ems 
could not be confirmed but all state health departments now have a 
detailed definition of the disease and states are reporting new 
cases daily falk said 
minnesota researchers in a recent followup study found that 
20 of 30 ems cases were among patients using brands of ltryptophan 
from one particular manufacturer such details can be a strong 
lead in the investigation falk said but he noted that there 
are numerous brands of ltryptophan and many can come from a 
single source so any number of brands could be involved 
it appears that most of the ltryptophan sold in the united 
states comes from four or five sources in japan falk said 
the food and drug administration last week announced its 
intention to seek a nationwide recall of all ltryptophan products 
in which the substance is the sole or major component the fda 
previously warned consumers to stop taking it

dissident playwright vaclav havel 
and excommunist leader alexander dubcek hugged and drank bohemia 
rose champagne friday night to greet the end of the nations two 
decades of gloom and despair 
in a crackling day of political drama havel and dubcek walked 
handinhand into the jammed magic lantern theater 
the two symbols of czechoslovak freedom met on a stage of 
history as the news of mass resignation of the entire politburo 
hit the downtown prague theater where an opposition news 
conference was in progress 
long live free czechoslovakia havel toasted to the jubilant 
crowd which jumped to its feet in joy 
earlier before sheer happiness and an overwhelming sense of 
unity flooded the entire hall some differences between the two 
father figures of czechoslovak independence still remained 
i do not share the opinion that socialism is unreformable 
dubcek said when asked about the political future of his country on 
the eve of imminent change in the communist leadership 
the party must be more open he insisted 
dubcek led the prague spring reforms crushed by sovietled 
armies of five warsaw pact countries in august 1968 after the 
soviet leader leonid brezhnev claimed counterrevolution threatened 
socialism in czechoslovakia 
i used to pass myself for a socialist but i have stopped 
using this word 15 years ago havel countered 
this word completely lost its meaning in the czech language 
he said it became a magic spell with which the bureaucratic 
power would protect itself 
for 13 years havel was persecuted as a leader of underground 
dissent he spent four years in prison and the rest of his time 
under police surveillance 
this can be different in other countries but i do not use the 
word socialism anymore what i want is social justice there are 
many examples to learn from havel explained 
crowds outside the theater hugged and kissed each other 
emotions choking the throats of youngsters who stood up at the 
beginning of this peaceful revolution 
we are all tired and exhausted and we hope the society will 
take away this heavy load as soon as possible said igor chaun a 
ponytailed representative of the students strike committee 
speaking in the theater 
students went on nationwide strike nov 18 the day after police 
beat peaceful demonstrators in downtown prague sparkling off a 
wave of massive protests finally leading to the politburos 
resignation 
in spite of 40 years of almost continuous oppression 
czechoslovaks seemed to have reached a spontaneous political 
consensus overnight 
we thank the students for returning time and history to this 
country havel said his words drowning in cheers and tears on 
stage 
nobody gave this to us as a christmas present we have have 
taken that one ourselves michal horacek a lyricist added from 
the wings 
finally we can respect ourselves

a federal judge threw out the irancontra case 
against a former cia station chief friday two days after attorney 
general dick thornburgh barred courtroom use of classified 
information on cia facilities and programs in central america 
us district court judge claude hilton said criminal charges 
against joseph fernandez focusing on his help to oliver norths 
secret contra resupply network must be dropped 
classified material the government refuses to divulge is 
essential to this defendant said the judge 
associate independent counsel laurence shtasel asked hilton for 
more time to work out a compromise with the cia to preserve part of 
the case but the judge refused saying his rulings about 
classified information in the fernandez matter have been known 
for quite some time they were issued in july 
irancontra prosecutors will try to revive the case in the us 
court of appeals in richmond va where they filed a notice of 
appeal following the session before hilton in alexandria va 
shtasel complained that thornburgh and us intelligence 
agencies have made bringing this case to trial extremely 
difficult 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh has called the 
data the government is protecting fictional secrets that are 
widely known to the public 
the information protected by an affidavit thornburgh filed 
wednesday concerns the locations of three cia facilities including 
stations in el salvador and honduras the government also is 
refusing to allow details to surface in court about three cia 
programs in costa rica the country where fernandez was cia station 
chief 
fernandezs defense in part is that some of his activities on 
behalf of north were intertwined with initiatives by costa rica to 
protect itself from possible invasion by nicaragua fernandez 
asserts for example that he did not lie when he told the cia 
inspector general that an airstrip built by the north network was 
an initiative of the costa rican government 
north the former white house aide is appealing his conviction 
on three charges destroying government documents aiding and 
abetting in the obstruction of congress and accepting an illegal 
gratuity 
last july 24 the day fernandezs trial was to begin hilton 
rejected a lastminute proposal by the justice department and 
independent counsel to substitute numbers for the cia facilities 
and to drop part of one charge dealing with an airstrip to avoid 
delving into the programs 
the justice department delayed the fernandez case for four 
months by seeking to appeal hiltons rulings but was turned away 
by the appeals court in richmond relations between the justice 
department and walshs office worsened during the delay and the 
independent counsels office wasnt shown the attorney generals 
affidavit until it was filed in court 
thornburgh said in a statement friday i continue to believe 
that this case can be tried without compromising the defendants 
right to a fair trial or the national security of this country 
he said the independent counsel and i agree that the district 
courts earlier rejection of substitutions and alternatives to the 
release of classified material constituted reversible error 
fernandez was indicted on four charges including obstructing 
inquiries into the irancontra affair by the cia inspector general 
and the presidentially appointed tower commission and making false 
statements 
the retired cia officer called hiltons decision wonderful 
but said he was troubled that cia operatives performing what he 
said were legitimate duties could be subjected to a politically 
motivated prosecution 
that is a chilling message to people who put their lives on 
the line every day fernandez said 
he said national security absolutely would have been 
endangered by disclosure at a trial of the classified information 
the government is keeping secret which he said involves 
intelligence sources 
fernandez characterized as onerous and unnecessary a 
question by a reporter who asked whether he had engaged in 
graymail the practice of trying to force as much classified 
information as possible into a case in an attempt to scuttle the 
prosecution 
the secret material at issue is the guts of the defenses 
case said fernandezs lawyer thomas wilson 
shtasel told the judge that a possible compromise with the cia 
might involve narrowing charges as well as drafting findings

vincent sardi can take back the legendary 
theater district restaurant he sold to a broadway producer in 1986 
a judge ruled friday 
the new owner sardis inc and its president ivan bloch 
failed to make the monthly purchase payments and sardi can 
foreclose on the note he holds said triallevel state supreme 
court justice burton sherman 
sardi sold his west 44th street restaurant to bloch and his 
group for 62 million with 1 million cash down monthly payments 
were to include the remaining principal plus interest a consulting 
fee for sardi and a fee to keep him from opening another restaurant 
within five years 
after one default in april the debt was restructured in july 
blochs group failed to make a required monthly payment of 
13626238 and sardi sued 
blochs group opposed the foreclosure saying sardi should have 
renegotiated with them again since he was aware of financial 
setbacks stemming from a decline in the broadway theater industry 
according to sherman 
the judge said bloch accused sardi of trying to grab the 
restaurant back because this theater season has the potential to be 
broadways best in years 
sardi is not under any legal obligation to renegotiate the 
terms of the note with the defendant sherman said 
blochs lawyer howard rubin said he hadnt discussed the 
ruling with his client 
open since 1922 sardis is a favorite hangout for broadway 
stars and stargazers located in the heart of the theater 
district the restaurants walls are adorned with caricatures of 
stage greats

two kingpins of the notorious medellin 
cocaine cartel managed to escape during a police raid on their 
operations center in a northern jungle and have eluded air and 
ground searches officials said friday 
president virgilio barcos office said police killed two cartel 
gunmen and wounded 10 others in shootouts during the sweep 
thursday fiftyfive people including five women were arrested at 
the jungle site and three nearby ranches said the office 
communique it reported no police casualties 
police seized 10 automobiles two boats weapons ammunition and 
communications equipment during the raid about 110 miles north of 
bogota the communique said 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo said the police operation was 
such a surprise that one of the cartels kingpins pablo escobar 
fled wearing only his pants 
national police gen octavio vargas said it was believed that 
jorge luis ochoa another major leader of the medellin cartel also 
was at the operations center when police attacked 
he said helicopter gunships and warplanes crisscrossed the area 
in case the fugitives tried to escape by air and ground patrols 
were making a methodical search of the jungle district some 70 
miles east of medellin 
vargas in a broadcast interview said the raid was the result 
of a tip from a colombian citizen and indicated the information was 
in response to a reward of nearly 300000 offered for clues 
leading to escobars arrest 
he said the raid was carried out by a special antidrug strike 
force created after drug traffickers received advance warnings 
about planned actions by regular police units 
the strike force backed by warplanes and army troops was not 
told where it was headed or who might be captured according to 
vargas 
he said a fierce gunbattle developed as helicopters carrying the 
strike force landed and the police charged escobar and perhaps 
ochoa were able to escape as policemen fought with dozens of 
gunmen vargas said 
he did not say how police knew that either escobar or ochoa were 
at the center but el tiempo quoted strike force commanders as 
saying clothing was found with documents belonging to escobar 
it said a shirtless escobar was seen running into the jungle a 
reporter and photographer from el tiempo went with the police on 
the raid 
the presidential communiqhe said cartels operation center was 
in the state of antioquia at the junction of the cocorna and 
magadalena rivers 
if escobar and ochoa were at the center or main ranch it would 
have been the closest security forces came to capturing them since 
the government declared war on traffickers more than three months 
ago 
barco made a war declaration hours after traffickers 
assassinated a presidential candidate sen luis galan at a bogota 
election rally aug 18

hrawi as lebanons 10th president and he pledged to carry on the 
national unity programs of his predecessor rene mouawad who was 
assassinated after 17 days in office 
eight hours later hrawi early saturday dismissed the military 
interim cabinet of christian gen michel aoun and formed a 14man 
government under moslem prime minister salim hoss 
hrawi a wealthy maronite catholic agricultural engineer 
promised friday to abide by the peace plan worked out by lebanese 
legislators last month in taif saudi arabia aimed at ending the 
14yearold civil war the arab leaguebrokered plan shifts 
political power to the moslem majority 
the peace march has started and it will not stumble said 
the new 62yearold president we shall not allow anyone to stand 
in the way 
aoun named head of an interim cabinet in september last year by 
outgoing president amin gemayel opposes the taif plan because it 
fails to say when syrias 40000 troops will be withdrawn from 
lebanon 
there was no immediate comment from the general early saturday 
on hrawis order to dissolve his interim cabinet 
hoss government included george saadeh a maronite who heads 
the rightwing phalange party as minister of post and 
telecommunications shiite moslem militia chieftain nabih berri was 
named minister of electrical and hydrolic resources as well as 
minister of housing and cooperatives druse warlord walid jumblatt 
was given the public works portfolio 
hrawi was elected by lawmakers who were guarded by hundreds of 
syrian troops and he was sworn in by speaker hussein husseini 
in hrawis hometown of zahleh people danced in the streets 
fired into the air and drank arak the national drink in 
celebration 
in his acceptance speech hrawi pledged to adhere to the taif 
accord and work for peace in lebanon 
i promise the nation to follow the same path that martyred 
president mouawad had planned for national unity said hrawi who 
has been in parliament since 1972 and maintains good contacts with 
lebanons moslems as well as neighboring syria 
the vote came on the eve of mouawads burial in his northern 
lebanese hometown of zgorta thousands of mourners met the 300car 
funeral procession and women kissed his casket 
mouawad 64 was assassinated by a remotecontrolled bomb 
wednesday that exploded amid his motorcade in moslem west beirut

long i ask god to shield him against his protectors an apparent 
reference to syria 
he also announced a nationwide day of mourning for mouawad on 
saturday the general however has denounced the taif accord and 
the earlier election of mouawad as unconstitutional 
syria and its leftist moslem and christian allies have blamed 
mouwads assassination on aoun but the general has denied 
involvement 
syrian president hafez assad sent a telegram to hrawi saying 
i see in your election an honor to the soul of the late president 
mouawad who was determined to end lebanons torment 
the white house said president bush commends the lebanese 
parliament for its swift decision and called for all lebanese 
to stand with president hrawi in his efforts to work for unity 
and peace 
those who do not will only isolate themselves further from 
lebanons people and the international community the statement 
said 
the arab league envoy to the united nations clovis maksoud 
said the election is a tribute to the courage of the members of 
parliament and the new president deserves all the support that the 
international community can provide

of balloting five blank ballots were found and one deputy 
abstained in the first round hrawi got 46 votes two less than 
the twothirds majority of 48 votes required by the constitution 
only a majority was needed on the second ballot 
his election was announced 20 minutes after the parliamentary 
session started at the park hotel in chtoura 25 miles east of 
beirut

10minute session of the house which unanimously voted to extend 
its mandate for another fouryear term ending in december 1994 
parliaments current mandate expires dec 31 1990 
voice of the nation a moslem radio station also said the new 
president would appoint a new army commander the report could not 
be officially confirmed 
mouawads election nov 5 had ended 14 months of political 
vacuum after gemayels term expired with parliment unable to gather 
the necessary quorum for an election session 
the political turmoil triggered one of the countrys bloodiest 
rounds of violence pitting aouns troops against syrian and 
lebanese moslem forces arab league intervention halted the 
fighting sept 22 
with 53 legislators the parliament had achieved its needed 
quorum to convene

the civil war which broke out in 1975 has prevented elections 
twentysix deputies have died and gemayel lost his seat when

transfer on oct 31 of 48 vietnamese 
some of the vietnamese told the un agency that security forces 
used martialarts tactics to immobilize them during the move from a 
detention center to a holding center for refugees who may be 
forcibly sent back to vietnam 
the government denied earlier this week that unreasonable force 
was used during the transfer

intelligence

referred a query on the allegations to the us embassy in bonn a 
spokesman there cornelius walsh told the associated press he

east german communist party chief egon krenz in 
an interview published saturday declared his countrys allegiance 
to socialism and said dismantling of more of the berlin wall 
depends on west germany 
krenz told londons financial times that a decision whether to 
open the brandenburg gate will be based on cooperation from west 
germany and west berlin 
the newspaper quoted krenz as saying at the moment we are 
not planning to open it the brandenburg gate whether we open it 
and when we open it depends not on us but on the other side 
there have been rumors that the crossing at the gate would soon be 
open 
the financial times reported krenz said that although east 
germany opened its western border to virtually unrestricted travel 
two weeks ago the main berlin wall will remain in place to prevent 
unification of east and west germany 
the falling away of the border would have significant 
consequences for carrying out certain plans for reunification 
krenz said and at the present the existence of two german states 
is a question of stability and peace in europe 
he also was quoted as saying it was unlikely that planned free 
elections in east germany could be held befsdore the end of 1990 
krenz became party chief oct 18 when hardline leader erich 
honecker was forced to resign 
the financial times said the interview was conducted friday in 
krenzs office at his party headquarters in east berlin 
it reported he criticized what he called west german efforts to 
force east germany into marketoriented reform in exchange for aid 
and said i cannot imagine east germany as a capitalist country 
the newspaper said krenz had these replies to questions on other 
issues 
east germanys interest in joining the european economic 
community is a difficult question to judge today it is a 
question to do with the common european house which we all want 
to build 
east and west germany could move toward a form of confederation 
if the north atlantic treaty organization and warsaw pact alliance 
dissolve 
the question of reunification at the moment is not on the 
agenda because it would totally change the power relationships in 
europe 
one reason for east germanys economic difficulties is adherence 
to an administrative system inherited from the stalinist past 
we are ready to take advice about making our state more 
effective and attractive but we are not ready to be dictated to 
with conditions from any other country especially the federal 
republic west germany

mothers who take multiple vitamins containing 
folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear 
babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects a new 
study concludes 
the birth defects were about onefourth as common among babies 
whose mothers took the overthecounter vitamins than among babies 
whose mothers didnt take vitamins according to a report in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
the apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the 
vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy leading the 
researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid 
when they first start trying to conceive 
the defects include spina bifida in which incomplete closing of 
the bony casing around the spinal cord typically results in mild or 
severe paralysis another spinal column defect is anencephaly in 
which major parts of the brain are lacking and death usually occurs 
within hours

the us supreme court could still make 
significant changes in abortion law despite the outofcourt 
settlement of one of three key abortionrights cases on its docket 
this session 
the high court is scheduled to hear arguments wednesday in cases 
from ohio and minnesota both of which focus on state laws 
requiring that one or both parents be notified before a minor gets 
an abortion 
those cases and an illinois dispute settled out of court 
earlier this week were seen by those on both sides of the issue 
as likely vehicles for the supreme court to expand or modify its 
july ruling allowing states greater leeway to restrict abortion 
the illinois case over state regulation of abortion clinics 
was the most likely of the three to result in changes to the 
courts 1973 roe vs wade ruling said jack tunheim chief deputy 
attorney general for minnesota the illinois case affected all 
women rather than just minors 
i dont think the illinois settlement will have any impact on 
our case tunheim said thursday the minnesota case and the 
ohio case both involve what we view as a very very different 
proposition the issue of minors abortions

this weekend network anchors and correspondents 
will go down to the sea in ships soviet and american guided 
missile cruisers for the summit meeting of president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the warship setting in malta may be reminiscent of august 1941 
when president franklin roosevelt and prime minister winston 
churchill met aboard warships in newfoundland for a meeting that 
produced the atlantic charter 
but now as then the fourth estate wont need sea legs as in 
1941 the ships involved in a historic meeting arent far from 
land this time about 1000 yards offshore in the harbor at 
marsaxloc on the south coast of malta 
this being the age of tv and satellites those covering and 
participating in the shipboard summits on saturday and sunday may 
be able to see themselves on tv on the ships the uss belknap and 
the soviet navys slava 
cnn whose washingtonbased anchor bernard shaw is among 60 
cable news network staffers heading to malta is hoping to install 
on each ship portable facilities to receive cnns worldwide 
newscasts a spokesman here says 
theyre trying hard to set it up he says obviously that 
takes a little more effort but thats what theyre trying to do 
peter jennings dan rather and tom brokaw the anchors of abc 
cbs and nbc respectively also are making the voyage to malta the 
point men of a threenetwork army totalling nearly 200 staffers 
from europe and the united states 
each anchor first will report from rome on the meeting friday 
between gorbachev and pope john paul ii before moving on to malta 
and coverage of a summit in which the upheaval in eastern europe 
may produce major news 
the white house press center the networks command stations and 
portable satellite transmission centers on malta will be in its 
capital city valletta a few miles from the harbor in which the 
shipboard meetings will occur 
but jeff gralnick lane venardos and joe angotti the executives 
in charge of the abc cbs and nbc expeditions respectively say 
they dont expect any problems with getting live video signals from 
the ships 
although anchoring newscasts from the ships is an unlikely 
possibility they say they anticipate being able to send live 
reports from the ships on their own separate circuits via 
microwave 
those transmissions and those of cnn then would be relayed to 
valletta where the network evening newscasts will be anchored 
for satellite feeds to the united states 
i dont anticipate any difficulties says angotti they 
are making available to us pretty complete access to getting 
pictures microwaved off of each of the ships 
i expect that well have as much coverage of this summit as we 
would on a landbased summit 
saturdays opening day of talks is to be held aboard the slava 
with sundays session aboard the belknap developments from each 
are to be reported live and on videotape as warranted 
bush and gorbachev are expected to close their summit with a 
joint statement and then hold separate news conferences the 
networks expect to air all three events live starting at 8 am 
est on sunday 
the only big problem that cbs venardos says he worries about is 
trying to get information when bush gorbachev and their spokesmen 
are isolated on these ships 
at such times he says theres no way to pick up the phone 
and ask for the spokesmen we have to wait until they come off 
the ships to find out what happened and so the clamor for 
information is going to be pretty loud down there i think 
but each side seems eager to have this one of the most 
accessibletotelevision summits in recent history he says 
the networks shipboard microwave transmission links can be shut 
down at any time venardos says but both sides have been 
extraordinarily interested in having live television available on 
this event the russians no less than the americans

margaret obrien thought it was just part of 
everyday life to make movies work with major stars meet the 
british prime minister and sit in parliament 
these people were a part of my life when i was a child she 
recalled they all seemed like part of the family 
obrien who made her film debut in 1942 in journey for 
margaret is featured with many other child stars in when we 
were young growing up on the silver screen the 90minute 
special from wttw in chicago will be telecast on pbs on monday

the show has scenes from many old movies and interviews with 
such child stars as obrien jackie cooper mickey rooney spanky 
mcfarland jane withers dick moore roddy mcdowall dean

bing took me under his wing and got his brother everett who 
was one of the big hollywood agents to become my agent hickman 
said in an interview i went right into more movies and kept 
working most of my childhood i got a lot of feedback from 
moviegoers who grew up with me identified with me and i think 
envied me because i was in pictures 
when we were young shows how the movies and child stars of 
the 1930s and 1940s reflected the social conditions of the times 
shirley temple became such a national booster during the depression 
that president franklin d roosevelt commented that an american 
could pay 15 cents to go to a movie look at the smiling face of 
a baby and forget his troubles 
the children expressed optimism and a hope for the future as 
well as serving as alter egos for young moviegoers 
jackie coogan became the first child star when he played

of her time now to promoting a new margaret obrien doll and to 
lecturing

dobie gillis now earns his living as an acting teacher his last 
film was sharkys machine in 1981

good things used to come in small 
packages now they come in a box inside a box packed in foam and 
wrapped in plastic 
all that packaging has some consumers fuming about hardtoopen 
containers and environmentalists warning that landfills are nearly 
full 
harold hughes says the packaging industry is getting a bad rap 
hughes director of the school of packaging at michigan state 
university sings the praises of modern synthetic packagings for 
their efficiency at protecting and helping promote the products 
they wrap 
but even hughes finds some packaging frustrating 
i bought a spark plug the other day and i was convinced i 
would break the thing before i got that plastic open i couldnt 
cut it i couldnt do anything to it i was ready to take it down 
and table saw it it happens he said 
michigan state which annually graduates twothirds of the 
worlds packaging students is regarded as a leader in the 70 
billion packaging field because of its research into packaging 
technology 
the packaging business mainly was a plain brownwrapper business 
when the michigan state school was started in 1952 at the urging of 
industry groups wanting improved wooden shipping crates 
the school opened with five students and a halftime instructor 
holding class in an old log cabin on campus 
now the school one of a handful of comprehensive packaging 
programs in the united states has 600 students 27 fulltime 
professors and 30 parttime graduate assistants who can use 
sophisticated equipment to wrap items in plastic or smash 
studentmade cardboard boxes to test their strength 
packaging majors study a mix of math chemistry physics 
accounting communications and business courses as well as 
packaging courses few come to michigan state planning to major in 
packaging hughes said most transfer into the school from 
engineering or other majors 
packaging school research is aimed at easing consumer 
frustration and landfill concerns hughes said recently the 
school attacked a classic consumer packaging complaint childproof 
medicine containers 
many elderly people find the containers too hard to open so the 
school joined with the geriatric research center at western 
michigan university to design alternatives the project was funded 
by the us consumer product safety commission 
students submitted a dozen designs including some likely to be 
adopted by industry hughes said 
what they found was that a 74yearold has basically the same 
hand strength as a 4yearold something that kept a 4yearold out 
also kept a 74yearold out he said 
the favored designs substituted intelligence for strength one 
uses a key or coin to unlock the cap another suggestion was to 
print the instructions on the container in contrasting colors 
rather than hardtoread whiteonwhite lettering 
a bigger headache is what to do with used packaging 
an estimated 30 percent to 35 percent of the 12 million tons of 
solid waste annually generated in michigan is packaging said fred 
clinton chief of the resource recovery section of the state 
department of natural resources 
the packaging does what it is supposed to do protect the 
product for a specified period of time the industry is doing a 
great job of designing packages to do that but at the same time 
they are moving toward a less recyclable package he said 
for example plastic bottles sometimes are made of several 
layers of different materials making them difficult to recycle he 
said 
research by the packaging school might help ease some of the 
environmental problems 
associate professor sue selke showed that high density 
polyethylene from recycled milk jugs is very similar to virgin 
plastic helping erase the stigma that recycled material is 
inferior to new 
her finding confirmed what environmentalists had been saying but 
lacked any proof to support 
selke also mixed wood fibers with plastic to create a composite 
material strong enough to be used as synthetic lumber for such 
things as pallets and packing crates the material potentially 
could expand the market for recycled plastic and encourage more 
recycling 
what we need is an entrepreneur to take our idea and start 
working on it we dont have that capability she said

americans marveled at the towering statue of 
ramses ii in an exhibit of artifacts from the mighty pharaohs 
reign but now it appears the colossus is a retouched image of 
someone else 
new research indicates the statue was of a lesserknown pharaoh 
who ruled 600 years before ramses the great was born experts say 
it became ramses because he had his artisans retouch the face and 
inscribe his name 
they also say the ancients would have been worshipping both 
godkings when they made offerings to the 24foot statue of red 
granite which weighs 47 tons 
no one doubted the statue was of ramses when in 1987 it was 
pulled from its grave of mud and weeds in memphis the ancient 
egyptian capital 
so positive were promoters that it was given a royal sendoff 
from the mediterranean port of alexandria a band played the 
national anthem and boat sirens blared a 20minute farewell salute 
with american help the statue was restored at memphis state 
university in tennessee then it joined other ramses artifacts 
already being exhibited to complete a hugely successful nationwide 
tour of us museums 
first at memphis then in denver boston charlotte nc and 
dallas the colossus stole the show 
but it isnt ramses says art historian hourig sourouzian who 
has spent years studying ramses statues 
its sesostris i she said ramses touched it up made it 
more his style and put his name on it 
of course when ramses did this the statue became ramses no 
problem but when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus 
they were remembering not only ramses but sesostris 
sesostris i also was called the great and died in 1926 bc 
he was a pharaoh of the middle kingdom while ramses was of the new 
kingdom ruling for 67 years in the 13th century bc 
ms sourouzian said a major problem in identifying large 
egyptian statues is that ramses had so many of them and his name 
was so famous that any oversized statue naturally was assumed to 
have been his 
nevertheless she said something disturbed me even then 
when she first saw the colossus in the mud of egypt 
the next time i saw it was on exhibit in memphis tenn she 
said it was beautifully restored beautifully lighted but when 
i took a deep look i said its not ramses 
rita freed who led the restoration team for the institute of 
egyptian art and archaeology at memphis state said she first heard 
of the sourouzian research a year ago 
its excellent i think shes right ms freed said by 
telephone from the boston museum where she now works 
i didnt think anything about it until we brought the statue 
to tennessee she said once we had it standing i said gee 
that looks middle kingdom but i must emphasize its ramses his 
name is on it and weve done a wonderful job of saving a 
magnificent statue 
it is no secret that ramses had a fondness for gigantic statues 
of himself he erected them throughout egypt 
some depict him standing some sitting the largest estimated 
to have stood 57 feet and weighed 1000 tons lies headless in his 
ruined mortuary temple the ramesseum 
perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at abu 
simbel southern egypt 
ms sourouzian said she discovered ramses the great borrowed 
colossal statues in his customary grand style she reported finding 
nine sesostris i retreads 
both pharaohs had connections with memphis now mit rahina 
village 17 miles south of cairo memphis contained several 
colossi including one of ramses now in cairos ramses square 
another of him remains at mit rahina on display where it fell 
a twin of the colossus that toured america also a madeover 
sesostris is in pieces at the mit rahina outdoor museum ms 
sourouzian said 
discovering what is or is not the ramses look hasnt been easy 
for the armenianborn scholar who is a doctoral candidate at the 
sorbonne in paris and coauthor of the official catalogue of 
cairos egyptian museum 
relics of ramses and his family are everywhere in egypt he had 
at least three queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to 
have fathered 167 children 
about 300 statues of ramses have survived and ms sourouzian 
has used her artists eye to examine them clothing expression 
muscles size of the legs items in each hand the crown 
statues of sesostris era had one look those of ramses another 
in earlier times statues showed fierceness because the 
pharaohs were trying to show they could smite their enemies ms 
sourouzian said ramses who truly was great could have 
portrayed himself on statues this way but he preferred a faint 
smile a gentleness 
a ramses statue has a sweet expression he has massive legs 
and wears a longer kilt he has a triangular or round face with 
almost almondshaped eyes looking down he wears a uraeus on his 
crown an ornamental cobra favored by new kingdom pharaohs 
the nine colossi that ramses recycled are backed by stone slabs 
and have straight mouths rectangular faces thick cheeks and eyes 
staring straight ahead the kilts are short 
despite ms sourouzians research the identity of the colossus 
scheduled to arrive home from america on dec 6 is not in question 
said egyptian antiquities official zahi hawass 
when the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient 
memphis the name well put under it is ramses ii he said

kieko hara has attended a cram school for 
months in a desperate effort to be ready for entrance exams shes 
5 and her parents hope kieko will make it into a topranked 
private elementary school 
she attends cramming sessions twice a week after kindergarten 
and on weekends 
some days kieko makes rice balls or crafts or is drilled in 
the japanese alphabet once a week she takes a practice test like 
those used by private schools to choose the few applicants they 
accept 
we wish she didnt have to go to cram school but if she gets 
into a good private system now then shell be able to enter 
the schools junior high automatically said yuko her mother 
japanese public education is praised for egalitarianism and the 
high scores of students on achievement tests but as public schools 
have become more equal parents have sought an edge elsewhere 
children are being sent at everyounger ages to cram schools 
called jukus or are going to private rather than public schools in 
hopes of gaining ground in the merciless collegeentrance 
competition 
the education ministry says 71 percent of elementary and junior 
high students attend jukus or have special outside lessons in 
effect creating an entire second school system it is a booming 
business estimated to be worth about 1 trillion yen or 7 billion 
a year 
some japanese contend the increasing role of private spending in 
education threatens the equality of opportunity created by the 
public school system others feel public schools have concentrated 
on educating the mass of students neglecting the bright and 
creative 
getting into the best schools frequently costs a staggering 
amount of money as well as work 
kiekos parents pay about 65000 yen 460 a month for her juku 
classes in addition to fees for her private kindergarten some 
classmates began attending a juku at age 3 to prepare for the 
kindergarten entrance exam and now have daily cram sessions before 
kindergarten and again in the afternoon 
such devotion to schooling has a long history in japan and some 
other asian nations but the intense competition is largely a 
postwar development that grew with economic prosperity 
japan spends less on public education than the united states 
both in total amount and percentage of gross national product 
in the last fiscal year the government allocated 16 trillion 
yen 112 billion to public education compared with 353 billion 
this year in the united states 
an education minstry study in 1987 said 42 percent of japans 
gnp went to public education compared with 48 percent in the 
united states 44 percent in britain and 42 percent in west 
germany 
spending on education in the united states varies greatly by 
school district and region but japan has followed a policy of 
equal distribution of resources it also does not track 
students separating them according to ability 
in the united states the federal government provides about 6 
percent of the public money for kindergarten through high school 
japans central government pays 43 percent much of it in subsidies 
to local districts that reduce regional disparities to less than 20 
percent according to government figures 
the education ministry approves textbooks and curricula so all 
students study essentially the same material at the same time 
in high school japanese students cram for college entrance 
exams that determine not only what schools they will attend but 
their chances for a good job afterward 
companies with the most prestige usually hire graduates of only 
the top universities 
college entrance exams have become more difficult as competition 
has intensified and frequently include material not covered in the 
public school curriculum according to education ministry studies 
with craming for exams now extending down to kindergarten by 
junior high school many students feel their life has already been 
ordained said naomi kikuchi who has two children in school 
in the past a leading public high school was considered the 
best preparation for college entrance that changed as the high 
schools became more equal 
many parents and students now see jukus with their 
singleminded emphasis on preparing for exams as more helpful than 
public schools in gaining admission to good universities 
about 70 percent of parents in a recent survey said they 
disapproved of jukus but most said they enrolled their children as 
a necessary evil 
other families try to get their children into top private 
kindergartens or elementary schools especially those of respected 
private universities that automatically admit graduates of their 
own lower schools 
the first year of aoyama universitys kindergarten one of the 
most soughtafter schools costs about 14 million yen 9500 
more than the 980000yen 6800 for the first year of university 
a survey by a major bank in 1987 found that education expenses 
account for 134 percent of aftertax earnings for an average 
japanese family in a metropolitan area 
that did not include salary forgone by the kyoiku mama 
mothers who devote themselves to their childrens education until 
the youngsters enter elementary school and for periods before 
entrance exams 
for people without money and mothers who have to work its 
hard to get children into a good school mrs kikuchi said

kabul afghanistan ap a man who spoke russian entered a 
store in the bazaar opened a black briefcase and produced an 
automatic weapon 
after several minutes of negotiation the shopkeeper paid him 
200000 afghanis or 500 for the gun when a reporter approached 
him in the street seconds later and addressed him in english the 
man got into a green jeep without license plates and drove away 
who was this man 
merchants said he and dozens like him identify themselves as 
soviet soldiers since the soviet withdrawal was completed feb 15 
they say those soldiers have sold them at least 20 automatic 
weapons 
where the men are stationed or what they are doing here the 
shopkeepers can only guess 
diplomats from countries with close ties to the soviet union say 
the only red army soldier in afghanistan is the embassy military 
attache they say all the others left in february 
the afghan governments position on the issue has not been 
clear on oct 14 the official news agency bakhtar reported the 
presence of soviet military advisers in kabul 
it added that they only handle deliveries of arms and provide 
information on the specifications of arms and ammunition to the 
afghan side and do not take part in military operations at all 
a day later government spokesman mohammed nabi amani said the 
bakhtar report was an error that there were no soviet soldiers 
in afghanistan 
another government official quoted an afghan military officer as 
saying soviet soldiers operated a missile base on the outskirts of 
kabul he said the soviets were unwilling to train afghan soldiers 
to use the scud rockets they provide which require advanced 
tracking methods and use of computers 
more than 1000 scuds have been fired and the government has 
credited them with important victories over moslem guerrillas 
according to diplomats in kabul and neighboring pakistan 
a us intelligence report has alleged that soviets in afghan 
uniforms operate the scud base 
many diplomats discount the report and say soviet soldiers no 
longer are engaged in combat in afghanistan some add however 
that soviet officers direct the civil war and the operations of 
khad the afghan intelligence and secret police agency at the 
defense and interior ministries 
a communist bloc journalist who visited the defense ministry 
frequently said he discovered soviet advisers in several 
departments 
any country that is supplying billions of dollars a year to 
another country is not going to sit by and let that country direct 
its war effort one diplomat said 
such influence by the soviets over afghanistans security 
politics and economy has created problems between the two 
governments 
afghan officials say privately that soviet officials tend to 
treat them like colonial subjects and a recent incident 
illustrates the point 
journalists were taken to a battlefield to see captured weapons 
a soviet bodyguard armed with grenades an assault rifle and seven 
clips of ammunition accompanied a soviet television crew 
during the helicopter flight to lalandar 12 miles south of 
kabul the bodyguard dressed in blue jeans and a combat jacket 
ordered an afghan officer to give up his seat and barked commands 
to the pilot 
when a swiss journalist snapped his photograph the guard 
grabbed the camera and exposed the film 
the journalist appealed to officials from the foreign ministry 
who said they could do nothing the ministry later protested to the 
soviet embassy 
and the question still remains who was the man in the bazaar

he used to be prime minister but 
yasuhiro nakasone campaigns as hard as a rookie these days trying 
to overcome the effects of scandal and save his political influence 
with an impressive election victory 
only two years ago he was completing five years in the highest 
office of an economic superpower he and ronald reagan then 
president of the united states were yasu and ron to each other 
then after he left office the recruit influencebuying scandal 
came to light he was forced to resign from the liberal democratic 
party which has governed japan since its formation in 1955 and is 
trying a political comeback at age 71 
please give me another chance to make my way back to the 
center of politics he entreated a crowd of about 1000 people 
bowing deeply japan still needs my experience and my worldwide 
network 
he made the appeal in the municipal auditorium in the farming 
country of gunma prefecture 100 miles north of tokyo 
it is not the custom for japanese prime ministers to retire and 
build libraries as monuments to their administrations 
instead they become elders of the liberal democrats overseeing 
their successors and wielding great influence through the loyalty 
of legislators they support with fundraising 
that process now is being questioned in japan and nakasone who 
has been in politics 43 years was hurt personally by his link to 
the bribery scandal 
analysts and aides say his campaign for parliament in elections 
expected early next year is crucial to his political survival 
he faces an uphill battle because he needs not only to be 
reelected but must win overwhelmingly if he is ever to come 
back into the political limelight said toshio yamaguchi a 
member of parliament and nakasone aide 
under japans multipleseat constituency system nakasone is not 
only running against opposition candidates but against prominent 
people in his own former party 
his constituency has four seats but each voter chooses only one 
candidate and the top four are declared winners 
those four seats are held by nakasone former prime minister 
takeo fukuda keizo obuchi former chief cabinet secretary and 
tsuruo yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the opposition socialist 
party 
fukuda is retiring at age 84 and plans to hand his mandate to 
his son yasuo 
all the incumbents are powerful votegetters in the 
constituency and the socialists in a break with their past 
practice plan to run a second candidate 
a party official said privately that the socialists want to 
force nakasone out of parliament and they are working to take a 
bite out of nakasones votes little by little 
failure to score at or near the top could end nakasones 
political influence 
among the many other liberal democratic leaders sidelined by the 
recruit scandal which began in mid1988 are former prime minister 
noboru takeshita former finance minister kiichi miyazawa and 
former foreign minister shintaro abe takeshita was prime minister 
when the scandal was revealed 
nakasone was especially affected because the activities that 
caused the scandal began while he was prime minister two aides 
face trial on charges of accepting bribes from recruit co an 
information conglomerate accused of trying to buy influence with 
huge donations and insider stock deals 
a dozen politicians bureaucrats and recruit executives were 
indicted for bribery 
recruit made large donations to nakasone but prosecutors 
declared them legal and nakasone to be innocent of wrongdoing 
i had no link to recruit and it was proven by prosecutors 
he told his constituents i was victimized badly by mass media 
and the public because i was an unusually strong leader for a 
japanese prime minister during my term in office i stepped into 
many areas most past leaders dared not touch 
in may nakasone was embarrassed publicly when the government 
and liberal democratic party bowed to the opposition and summoned 
him to parliament to testify about the recruit affair 
he subsequently resigned from the party and as a consequence 
lost the leadership of his party faction 
analysts say nakasone probably never will regain the influence 
he had even if he rejoins the party because his power base within 
it is crumbling it is considered only a matter of time until 
michio watanabe an ambitious disciple of nakasone takes over his 
old faction 
the former prime minister had hoped to remain prominent in 
foreign affairs through a governmentsupported think tank he 
established that plan foundered when the recruit scandal dried up 
corporate contributions to his world peace research institute 
although nakasone believes he has a chance to start over 
political analyst soichiro tawara said an election victory would 
only delay his retirement and save a little piece of his pride 
i dont think the japanese general public is as generous as 
nakasone and his aides wish he said it is certain that most 
japanese share the view that nakasones time is over and one 
election cant change the flow

wall street is hoping for some help from the 
calendar soon to pull the stock market out of its doldrums of the 
past couple of months 
this year perhaps more vehemently than most the slumping 
securities industry is starting to talk up the yearend rally a 
phenomenon whose regularity and reliability depends on whose 
arithmetic you use 
experienced investors naturally tend to be leery of any 
mechanical formulaic approach to forecasting the ups and downs of 
the stock market 
so if you try to tell them stocks have a tendency to do well in 
some specified period your odds of making much of an impression 
are pretty long 
nevertheless advocates of the yearendrally doctrine say there 
are some sound logical reasons in favor of owning stocks over the 
next couple of months 
as december passes they maintain downward pressure begins to 
ease on any issues that are being dumped for yearend tax purposes 
or by investing institutions such as pensionfund managers readying 
their portfolios for annual reports to their bosses and customers 
once january arrives those same institutions presumably must 
map out their plans for the year ahead and put new cash they have 
received to work 
these forces often are offered as partial explanations for the 
socalled january effect defined by investment advisor yale hirsch 
as the unmistakeable tendency for certain stocks to have much 
larger gains in january than in the other months of the year 
though it is still the subject of much contention among 
analysts the january effect has gained a significant following 
among investors in recent years 
indeed there has been evidence that traders trying to buy 
stocks ahead of the january wave over the past few years have 
started to move it at least part way into december 
the midnovember to earlyjanuary period has been the 
bestperforming segment of the year for the market over the last 
few decades asserts norman fosback editor of the advisory 
publication market logic 
for those who subscribe to this view one popular strategy for 
exploiting it starts with the list of stocks at new 12month lows 
around middecember 
the issues the reasoning goes are artificially depressed in 
the waning weeks of the year by tax selling and other seasonal 
pressures so its not unreasonable to hope that they will rebound 
early in the new year once that weight is lifted 
statistical studies by hirsch show this presumption has been 
borne out most of the time since the mid1960s but not always 
in the market rallies of early 1975 and early 1976 for example 
stocks from the dec 15 newlow list rose more than twice as much 
as the overall market by feb 15 
even in the few years when the dec 15 lows showed further 
losses two months later their declines were generally smaller than 
that of the market as a whole 
the spell was broken in early 1986 the dec 15 lows from 1985 
which numbered only four were further battered by plunging world 
oil prices 
the magic seemed to be back last winter however by hirschs 
reckoning the 23 new york stock exchange issues at new lows on 
dec 15 sported an average gain of 132 percent two months later 
outstripping a 68 percent rise for the nyses composite index over 
the same period 
the odds of success in such speculative trading endeavors are 
stacked against the small investor but for those with an interest 
in such things whether such a scavenger strategy has any rewards 
left looks to be in for a pretty fair test this time around 
the recent newlow list of nyse stocks just a few weeks ahead 
of dec 15 has included several dozen names ranging from blue 
chips to companies in bankruptcy proceedings

mikhail s gorbachev broke the mold of dour 
intransigent soviet leaders during his first foray onto the world 
stage and hes been surprising nowwary western counterparts ever 
since his 1985 summit with ronald reagan 
based on his past performance theres every reason to believe 
that the 58yearold gorbachev might spring a surprise on president 
bush when the two meet off malta on dec 2 and 3 so much so that 
white house officials say extensive preparations are under way to 
prepare the american president for anything that might be thrown at 
him 
gorbachevs reform policies in the soviet union and eastern 
europe have been surprising enough to americans his style leans to 
the unexpected as well 
when gorbachev and reagan posed for pictures at the start of 
their meeting in geneva four years ago the american president kept 
mum heeding his advisers counsel not to take a chance on spoiling 
the atmosphere of his first ussoviet summit with an offhand 
remark 
the russian showed no such caution 
when a reporter told gorbachev he had been described by a fellow 
soviet official as a man with a nice smile but iron teeth 
gorbachev replied im still using my own teeth but as to the 
substance of your question both the president and i have good 
grounds to believe we can have a good talk 
later the same day after his teteatete with reagan stretched 
well beyond the carefully choreographed schedule the soviet leader 
broke a comment blackout imposed by both sides i think we will 
have a good relationship he said 
at the last snap summit in reykjavik iceland in 1986 the 
united states went prepared to negotiate the framework for a treaty 
reducing intermediaterange nuclear missiles gorbachev instead 
proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons in all categories 
reagan took him up on the challenge and the two men engaged in 
what was later described as historys higheststakes poker game 
seeing and raising each other one weapons category after another 
until they stumbled over the last chip reagans beloved star wars 
plan 
the american refused to concede the soviet insisted it was all 
or nothing and nothing it was 
bushs advisers have let it be known the new us president will 
not let himself be drawn into a game like that at the summit off 
malta 
but as recently as last may when secretary of state james a 
baker iii went to moscow expecting to set a date for the next 
ussoviet summit gorbachev caught the new foreign policy chief 
off guard with a bold new offer of substantial cuts in conventional 
forces in europe 
the initiative broke a yearsold logjam over how to count and 
reduce the two sides nonnuclear ground and air forces in europe 
but it embarrassed baker who was unprepared for such a move and 
gave gorbachev a public relations coup 
bush facing criticism that he was slow and indecisive in 
developing a policy toward the soviet union recovered at the end 
of the month with his own conventional arms proposal announced at a 
nato summit in brussels 
but six weeks later gorbachev pulled another trick out of his 
hat 
as the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies 
gathered in paris for their annual economic summit they received a 
letter from gorbachev appealing for entry to the world economic 
community 
after decades of cold war and economic rivalry the soviet chief 
wrote that his effort to restructure the soviet economic and 
society is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and 
entire participation in the world economy 
his letter instantly became the central focus of the summit 
talks

it was new years day 1949 and soprano lily 
pons was nearing the end of the mad scene from lucia di 
lammermoor on the stage of the metropolitan opera house 
reaching for one of the fiendishly difficult high fs that were 
her trademark in the role the diminutive french diva fell short 
emitting what a new york times reviewer later called a blemished 
final tone 
but radio listeners who heard a tapedelayed broadcast of the 
donizetti opera the next day never detected a false note in its 
place engineers had spliced in another high f from the same aria 
one that miss pons had hit squarely on the mark 
the disparity between the reviews and the radio caused an uproar 
in the music world 
texaco sponsor of the saturday matinee broadcasts had known 
that many stations would delay lucia because it conflicted with 
the rose bowl football game but the incident helped bring such 
tapedelays into disrepute and eventually a special network was 
set up just for the opera series one requirement for membership 
stations had to agree to carry all performances live 
on dec 2 more than 300 stations in the united states and 
canada will be doing just that as texaco inaugurates its 50th 
season sponsoring met broadcasts the longest continuous national 
sponsorship of a program in radio history 
by the end of the season texaco will have aired 990 
performances of 124 different operas without commercial 
interruption the company now spends 35 million a year on the 
broadcasts which the met estimates are heard by 2 million to 6 
million people 
for texaco the close identification with one of the nations 
most cherished cultural institutions has proved a public relations 
dream worth every dollar 
there is nothing new about the principle on which we acted in 
merging oil and opera company president wss rodgers said at 
the time of its initial broadcast mozarts le nozze di figaro 
on dec 7 1940 american business has long acted on the policy 
of success through service to the greatest number 
in the years since then texaco radio audiences have thrilled to 
virtually all of the worlds leading opera singers in their prime 
from kirsten flagstad and lauritz melchior to birgit nilsson and 
jon vickers from licia albanese and eleanor steber to maria callas 
and joan sutherland from richard tucker and jussi bjoerling to 
luciano pavarotti and placido domingo 
they have occasionally heard history in the making as when the 
great comic basso salvatore baccaloni made his debut on the very 
first broadcast or on the broadcast of feb 9 1974 when a new 
zealand soprano named kiri te kanawa made an unscheduled debut as a 
lastminute substitute for teresa stratas in verdis otello 
and they have been witness to tragedy as on the broadcast of 
jan 23 1988 when an 82yearold vocal coach jumped to his death 
from a balcony during intermission after act 2 of verdis 
macbeth 
the announcer who conveyed that grim news to the radio audience 
was peter allen who is launching his 15th season in the broadcast 
booth behind the grand tier that stint might normally qualify him 
as an institution were it not for the astonishing record of his 
predecessor the legendary milton cross who presided over the 
broadcasts from their pretexaco days in the 1930s until his death 
in 1975 
i had auditioned because they thought mr cross might want to 
retire recalled allen who at the time was a staff announcer for 
classical radio station wqxr i used to be a subscriber to the 
opera myself to take over his job was more than anything i had 
dreamed of 
allen said he prepares for each weeks broadcast by doing 
research on the operas and composers attending dress rehearsals 
and even prowling around the stage to inspect the scenery 
i wander all over the place looking for details so i can try 
to give the listeners a picture of what theyre missing allen 
said sometime i even notice things that most people in the 
auditorium dont like the cafe scene of la boheme where franco 
zeffirelli has used real street posters from 19th century paris 
advertisements for laxatives and lingerie 
allen also tries to anticipate things the radio audience might 
hear that wouldnt make sense to them without some explanation 
i tell them that florestans chains will rattle in the prison 
scene in fidelio and that the audience will laugh when the 
inventors workshop comes to life in tales of hoffmann he said 
at broadcast time he has one constant companion in the booth 
his wife sylvia 
thank goodness she always sits next to me allen said 
during the centennial gala i was introducing a conductor and i 
either said leonard bernstein when i meant james levine or vice 
versa she kicked me and i was able to recover before the baton 
came down 
allen said his most exciting challenge came during a 1987 
performance of wagners parsifal 
it was the middle of the first act and suddenly i heard 
curtain coming down i barely had time to shut the door and put 
on my earphones when the music stopped and i had to go on 
part of the stage that was supposed to move forward mechanically 
for a scene change had snagged and it took technicians 23 minutes 
to move it into place by hand 
luckily i had lots of written material ready allen said 
since you never know what the intermission guests will say i 
dont want to anticipate or contradict them so i look for 
something relevant interesting but out of the way 
on that occasion allen learnedly discussed how much puccini 
loved parsifal and the mets role in breaking the wagner 
familys ban on having the opera performed outside bayreuth 
germany 
the first broadcast this year will be the met marathon a 
fourhour program featuring recorded excerpts from the 194041 
season and a singers roundtable with performers who were at the 
met at that time including rose bampton eleanor steber and rise 
stevens 
regular broadcasts begin dec 9 with richard strauss die frau 
ohne schatten and continue through april 21 at intermission 
each week edward downes will again preside over the texaco opera 
quiz as he has for 32 years other intermission features will 
include analyses of the days operas presented by such favorites 
as impresario boris goldovsky who is celebrating his 45th season 
on the broadcasts

this young nation hewn from a rocky 
mediterranean archipelago hopes to use its fleeting moment at 
superpower center stage to boost its own prosperity as well as play 
a part in the cause of peace 
we as the americans would say are about to play the biggest 
and most important ball game of our times says government 
tourism official michael refalo anticipating next weekends summit 
talks between president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev aboard ships in maltese waters 
i will go so far as to say that much of our future prospects 
depend on the image which we portray of ourselves and project 
during these momentous days refalo said 
the potential for a public relations bonanza is obvious most of 
the 2000 reporters expected to cover the summit will not get to 
the us and soviet warships where bush and gorbachev will hold 
their talks they will be left behind on land with time to 
discover malta 
along with the opportunity for malta comes a potential for 
difficulties 
the opposition socialist party whose relations with the 
governing nationalist party are always strained and sometimes 
violent has scheduled an antinuclear demonstration during the 
summit and invited a delegation from moammar gadhafis libya to 
take part gadhafi a foe of the united states has said he opposes 
the summit meeting on foreign warships in the mediterranean 
malta which lies in the mediterranean sea between italy and 
libya is off the beaten path for superpower diplomacy and both 
visiting presidents plan visits with prime minister edward fenech 
adami 
bush will be the first us president to visit since franklin d 
roosevelt stopped here 44 years ago en route to a world war ii 
summit in yalta in the soviet union gorbachevs visit will be the 
first by a soviet leader 
maltas location has made it desirable to a long list of 
conquerors stretching back 2000 years and including the 
phoenicians carthaginians and romans its other foreign rulers 
have included the spanish the crusading knights of malta napoleon 
and finally the british 
the summit comes as malta which became independent from britain 
25 years ago is beginning a new push for industry and tourism by 
promoting itself as an international conference center 
the summit comes too at a time when the island is beginning a 
drive to become the switzerland of the mediterranean as a 
financial and trading center said joseph fenech the government 
minister responsible for offshore banking and maritime affairs 
we feel that if malta is good both for bush and gorbachev it 
is good for any prospective investor with whom together we shall 
build the success of our future as a maritime state and a financial 
and trading center he said 
the guided missile cruiser uss belknap and the soviet missile 
cruiser slava are expected to anchor in marsaxlokk bay within 
sight of fishing villages on the eastern end of the island and 
about 220 miles north of tripoli libya 
there are some worries among local officials about maltas own 
volatile brand of politics and about the reaction of libya 
opposition leader karmenu mifsud bonnici traveled to libya in 
midnovember for meetings with gadhafi and when he returned he 
called for gorbachev and bush to include mediterranean tensions on 
their agenda 
enmity between the united states and libya reached a peak with 
the april 1986 us bombing raids on tripoli and benghazi attacks 
the united states declared were reprisals for libyan acts of 
terrorism published reports said maltese air traffic controllers 
passed on a warning to libya shortly before the american planes 
made their strike 
still us officials in malta say they see no special security 
problem from libyans who travel freely in malta 
maltas conservative nationalist government has downgraded 
political and military relations with libya since taking power in 
1987 and has sought to strengthen its economic ties with the west 
while remaining officially nonaligned it has sought to take a 
place among the family of western european nations 
fenech adami flew to bonn on nov 19 for six days of talks with 
west german leaders including chancellor helmut kohl on the 
superpower summit and on maltas plan to apply for full membership 
in the european economic community malta currently has an 
association agreement with the common market and conducts most of 
its trade with ec countries particularly west germany italy and 
britain 
the maltese hope their contributions to the summit can help 
foster their image as an island of peace 
the holding of the summit here is not only an honor to all 
maltese but presents above all the greatest challenge our country 
and people have had to meet in peacetime said the governments 
refalo

eastern airlines machinists were left alone on the 
picket lines after pilots and flight attendants abandoned their 
8month strike but even for the unions that surrendered labor 
peace remained elusive 
eastern warned members of the air line pilots association and 
the attendants transport workers union they wont necessarily get 
their old jobs back 
it is regrettable that they didnt come to this conclusion 
earlier eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said thursday they 
didnt so we had to go out and hire permanent replacements 
the 2200 striking pilots ended their strike wednesday after 
president bush vetoed a bill to create a congressional advisory 
committee on eastern which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization five days after the strike began march 4 
the 6000member flight attendants union followed suit later 
that day that left just the 8500member machinists union which 
began the bitter strike 
union leaders contend that easterns bankruptcy ordered by 
parent texas air corp was a tactic to break the unions 
on the picket lines in atlanta machinists said they felt 
abandoned but were determined to continue what has at times taken 
on the look of a personal battle between unionists and texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo 
everybody out here is pretty much in shock said steve d 
mack a striking ramp worker 
tony chapman vice president of the machinists atlanta branch 
said his union wouldnt follow the pilots 
we will continue chapman said we started this strike 
the pilots acted on their own 
members at the union local across the street from eastern 
headquarters in miami chanted strike strike strike after 
receiving word of the settlements late wednesday 
eastern said it will fight to keep replacement workers hired 
during the strike pilots and flight attendants ready to return to 
work were asked to sign a recall list at eastern which said it 
would take them back as openings occurred 
eastern doesnt have jobs for the 2200 striking pilots said 
ms ceremsak she said eastern has 1850 pilots including 850 
union members who crossed picket lines and there are already 100 
union pilots on a recall list 
the number of openings for flight attendants wasnt immediately 
available but nancy currier vice president of transport workers 
local 553 in miami said 1500 union attendants had crossed picket 
lines 
the pilots and attendants are prepared to take eastern to court 
to win back jobs ms currier said 
we dont agree with easterns position and our lawyers dont 
agree with their position ms currier said 
the strike began after 1 years of federally mediated talks 
between eastern and the machinists union stalemated over demands 
for 150 million in wage cuts and workrule changes 
the other unions joined the strike in part out of the suspicion 
that texas air which bought eastern in 1986 wanted only to bust 
the unions and milk cash from eastern 
texas air which broke strikes and unions at continental 
airlines in 1983 infuriated the eastern unions by spinning 
easterns computer reservations system off into a subsidiary and 
selling its prized northeast shuttle to donald trump 
lorenzo and other eastern executives said they had taken over a 
company with severe financial problems and unreasonable labor costs 
and had to make cuts with or without the unions 
eastern which operated nearly 1100 daily flights before the 
strike has said it is rebuilding into an efficient carrier that 
will be up to 90 percent of its prestrike size when it emerges 
from chapter 11 next year

representatives from 20 south 
pacific nations today endorsed a pact aimed at banning the huge 
60milelong drift nets that environmentalists say are robbing the 
ocean of marine life 
the japanese government and the taiwanese fishing industry main 
users of the fishing technique will be asked on monday to accept 
the convention which bans driftnet fishing across large areas of 
the pacific 
delegates attending a weeklong meeting in wellington pledged to 
work to eliminate drift net fishing from the region 
most governments in the area already have barred drift net boats 
from their waters 
the area covered by the convention stretches from the marshall 
islands in the north french polynesia in the east new zealand in 
the south and australia in the west 
but the regional governments do not have the power to force the 
driftnetters from international waters where they string their 
nets across the tuna migration paths 
philipp muller chairman of the pacific forum fisheries agency 
told reporters there had been signs of cooperation from japan 
and taiwan but added they will want to take the protocols back 
home and there will be long discussions 
japanese diplomats are attending the conference and a delegation 
from the taiwan deepsea tuna fishing boat owners and exporters 
association is due to arrive on monday 
countries represented at the conference are to sign the 
convention at government level within the next few weeks binding 
themselves to taking action if they have not already done so 
the regional governments fear the driftnetters will seriously 
deplete albacore tuna stocks within two years endangering the 
fragile economies of island states which depend on fishing 
a us senate move wednesday and a taiwanese pledge to cut its 
south pacific fleet have raised hopes the technique could be 
outlawed or discouraged 
senior taiwanese officials have said the country would send 24 
drift net boats into south pacific this season compared with 60 
last year 
the senate has voted to bar imports of tuna caught by the drift 
net fishing which is known as wall of death fishing because 
the 60mile nets entrap and suffocate virtually everything in their 
path 
the bill is aimed mainly at tuna imported from japan and taiwan 
worth about 250 million last year 
south pacific countries represented at the conference include 
american samoa australia cook islands federated states of 
micronesia fiji french polynesia kiribati marshall islands 
nauru new caledonia new zealand niue palau papua new guinea 
solomon islands tokelau tonga tuvalu vanuatu and western samoa

the nations exports of farm products in the 
fiscal year that ended on sept 30 came close to the 40 billion 
forecast by agriculture department experts three months ago 
according to a detailed report by the departments economic 
research service the value of shipments in the 1989 fiscal year 
was almost 397 billion up 12 percent from 353 billion in 1988 
that was the biggest export value since the record 438 billion 
in 1981 it also marked the third consecutive yeartoyear increase 
since exports plunged to 263 billion in 1986 
officials said the 1989 export surge came despite a sharp 
cutback in the departments export enhancement program or eep 
which subsidizes selected exports to designated overseas markets 
agricultural imports meanwhile were valued at a record 215 
billion up from about 21 billion in 1988 the previous high 
vegetables grain and grain products sugar and rubber showed the 
largest increases the report said 
as expected the actual volume of 1989 exports of key 
commodities was down from the previous year but higher unit 
prices for many items offset the decline in shipment tonnages 
for example total us wheat exports dropped to 377 million 
metric tons from 405 million tons in 1988 despite huge shipments 
to the soviet union and china the value boosted by higher market 
prices rose to more than 6 billion from 45 billion in 1988 
corn exports in 1989 jumped 15 percent from 1988 to 507 million 
tons the most in a year since 1981 that included a record 156 
million tons shipped to the soviets total shipments were worth 
61 billion up from 432 billion in 1988 
soybean exports in 1989 were reported at 141 million tons down 
from 211 million tons in 1988 the lowest since 1975 the export 
value at 408 billion was down from 507 billion 
exports of cotton totaled 14 million tons or 66 million 
bales the highest level in five years the report said value 
reflecting lower prices dropped to 204 billion from 214 
billion in 1988 
the analysis also showed that spending for export subsidies 
under eep dropped 15 percent in 1989 to less than 28 billion from 
nearly 33 billion in 1988 
in terms of commodities the eep subsidies covered less than 
159 million tons of wheat down almost 40 percent from 263 
million tons subsidized in 1988 
all commodities authorized under the program were cut back 
according to the report others included 
rice 20000 tons in 1989 down 83 percent from 120000 in 1988 
barley 529000 tons down 69 percent from 17 million 
grain sorghum none in 1989 and 213000 tons in 1988 
vegetable oils 105000 tons down 71 percent from 13000 
frozen poultry 8000 tons down 39 percent from 13000 
eggs 42 million dozen down 61 percent from 1075 million 
cattle none compared with 12000 head in 1988

an agriculture department scientist has 
developed a surefire test to detect a costly virus in fruit tree 
seedlings 
plant pathologist ahmed f hadidi of the departments 
agricultural research service said the test detects the presence of 
tomato ringspot 100 percent of the time compared with current 
diagnostic procedures that are only about 60 percent reliable 
the virus causes stem pitting disease of stone fruits like 
peaches and union necrosis disease of apples these are among the 
most common diseases of commercial orchards on the east coast the 
agency said 
each year the virus is responsible for millions of dollars in 
losses of peach nectarine prune and apple trees as well as heavy 
damage to grapes and raspberries 
in the past it has been a difficult and sometimes impossible 
virus to diagnose in fruit crops said hadidi who works at the 
agencys national plant germplasm quarantine laboratory in 
beltsville md fruit trees can be infected with the virus for a 
few years before they exhibit symptoms of the disease which are 
then followed by the trees decline and death 
hadidi said he expects that by the time it is marketed as a 
commercial kit it will be cheap enough to use for screening trees 
for the virus a patent application is being filed a step toward 
commercial development

japans fair trade commission on friday issued 
stern warnings to two japanese computer manufacturers that may have 
engaged in unfair trade practices by bidding one yen on local 
government projects 
after several weeks investigation the commission decided the 
bids of one yen the equivalent of 07 cent made by fujitsu ltd 
and nec corp required stern warnings said takashi yamamoto of 
the ftcs trade practices division 
the commission said the low bids made on contracts to design 
computer software for several city governments were judged likely 
to be unjust lowprice sales and customer inducement by 
unjust benefits under the unfair trade practices chapter of the 
antimonopoly law 
the ftcs decision stopped short of saying the bids had violated 
the law but warned if the two companies make excessively low bids 
again there was a strong possibility the antimonopoly law would 
be applicable 
nec said in a statement that it had reflected deeply on the 
social outcry over careless bidding and had taken measures to 
ensure it would not occur again 
fujitsu also issued a statement saying it taken steps to prevent 
such problems and repeated a request to hiroshima and nagano 
officials to cancel the contracts won with low bids 
shortly after fujitsu won a contract to design computer software 
for the hiroshima city water supply system with a oneyen bid 
several other such cases surfaced 
fujitsu and nec were found to have submitted bids of one yen to 
design software for libraries in nagano city in central japan and 
for planning an information system for wakayama prefecture in 
western japan fujitsu won both contracts 
the commission said fujitsu also won a contract to develop a 
culture and educational information system for hiroshima city with 
a 700 bid and with a 70 bid won another contract to conduct a 
feasibility study on a library computer system for saitama 
prefecture near tokyo 
these cases are not common but recently there has been a 
sudden increase that seems to indicate a trend the commissions 
statement said 
yamamoto said it was uncertain whether the ftc ruling would 
affect the contracts we cannot legally say whether the contracts 
should be carried out or not the local government officials and 
fujitsu will have to discuss that issue he said 
the deals provoked criticism over what us officials charged 
was weak enforcement of japans antitrust laws ftc officials say 
warnings are strict enough to enforce compliance with fair trade 
rules

the european community commission said 
friday it plans to propose new measures early next year to make 
corporate takeovers in the 12nation trade bloc easier 
the commission said in a statement that takeover bids faced 
formidable legal obstacles in many member countries but such 
roadblocks could be overcome by new measures and the application of 
current ec legislation 
the executive commission said new measures were needed to 
facilitate the restructuring of european industry as the 12 
member states attempt to integrate their economies before the end 
of 1992 
the commission said it wants among other things to strengthen 
the voting rights of shareholders and force bidders to outline 
their plans to target companies and their employees 
the commission wants to propose the regulations by march 
the move followed a british demand for measures to counter an ec 
proposal that would give the commission power to block large 
mergers on antitrust grounds 
takeover bids are becoming increasingly numerous and are 
expected to continue as europe prepares to meld into one market in 
1992 
among the ec nations west germany and the netherlands have the 
highest barriers to takeover bids while takeovers are more simple 
in britain and in france

the lite brigade is swelling thanksgiving 
gluttony aside american food companies are jumping on the trend of 
giving shoppers the same great taste but no fat or cholesterol 
or sugar or salt 
next to foods that can be microwaved light foods continue to 
be the fastestgrowing segment in the store said judy ball 
manager of customer relations for kroger co the nations largest 
supermarket chain 
if two comparable products are on the shelf next to each 
other the one that says light will probably sell better she 
said in a telephone interview from her cincinnati office 
one of the newest entries is the venerable hostess cupcake with 
the sevenloop squiggle signature on top and sugary white cream in 
the middle 
the new version called hostess lights is 97 percent fatfree 
contains no cholesterol and has fewer calories than its regular 
hostess counterpart 
this allows people who are watching their diet to have a sweet 
snack every once in a while without feeling guilty said pamela 
marsh a snack nutritionist at hostess 
this allows them to have their cake and eat it too 
hostess cupcakes were invented 70 years ago and helped build 
hostess parent company st louisbased continental baking co 
into the nations largest wholesale bakery 
hostess lights the cupcake for the 1990s will be available 
around the nation in a few months theyve been on sale since 
october in new york philadelphia boston and washington and have 
fared fairly well marsh said 
rolling out more and more products that tout healthful qualities 
has probably increased overall sales in the food industry but only 
slightly said roger spencer a stock analyst with dean witter 
reynolds in chicago 
any growth in a slowgrowth industry is always welcome but 
its certainly not anything that would bowl you over spencer 
said 
he said that overall the healthy products seem to be drawing 
consumers away from their less healthy counterparts rather than 
increasing consumption of products 
the skinny guys will keep buying what theyve always bought 
and the fat guys will use this new stuff spencer said and 
well all live to be about the same age 
the only problem with the food industrys urge to be healthy is 
that no one has agreed on what is healthy 
its kind of confusing for consumers ball said when they 
pick up something that says light it may not be at all what they 
expect 
the food and drug adminstration which oversees the majority of 
food products sold in supermarkets set standards in 1980 for 
lowcalorie and reducedcalorie foods but so far has no 
requirements for foods labeled light or lite said emil 
corwin an fda spokesman 
however corwin said the fda is studying possible definitions 
for the light category 
he said lowcalorie foods must have no more than 40 calories per 
serving and reducedcalorie foods must be at least onethird lower 
in calories 
in 1986 the fda proposed requirements for cholesterolfree 
lowcholesterol and reducedcholesterol foods corwin said 
under the proposal foods labeled cholesterolfree should 
have less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol per serving 
lowcholesterol should have less than 20 milligrams of 
cholesterol per serving and reducedcholesterol should have at 
least 75 percent less cholesterol than the normal serving 
meanwhile other regulatory agencies like the us department of 
agriculture and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms also 
are involved with their own set of guidelines for lite beef and 
lite whiskey 
the lack of definitions is part of a broader controversy being 
debated in washington about the use of improper health claims on 
products and concerns that food labels are becoming meaningless 
what i always say is that the grocery aisles are becoming the 
mine fields of misleading information for consumers said bruce 
silverglade legal director of the center for science in the public 
interest 
silverglade said the explosion of health boasts and bravado may 
mean a boost in profits now but food companies will pay for that 
by alienating consumers in the long run 
if unabated consumers will disregard everything on the 
label he said well be in a position of throwing out the baby 
with the bathwater because people simply wont know what to 
believe 
hostess lights are a good example of products that may be 
walking the line between what is slick marketing and what is a 
genuinely healthful alternative 
the cupcakes come in three flavors plain filled with vanilla 
pudding and with a raspberry filling theyre made with a new 
angel food cake recipe that doesnt use egg yolks or animal fat 
according to the fdas proposed guideline for light or low 
fat products the reducedcalorie product should have at least 
onethird fewer calories than the regular version 
two of the three hostess light cupcakes miss that mark and the 
other light cupcake the one with plain cake passes only because 
its a halfounce lighter than cupcakes made with the original 
recipe 
our use of the word light does not fall into the 
reducedcalorie category some people may use the term to relate to 
calories but were not positioning this as a diet food said 
marsh a hostess spokeswoman 
she said the brand name light was selected because the cupcakes 
are 97 percent fatfree and they contain no cholesterol

grain and soybean futures prices were slightly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade paced 
by modest gains in the corn market 
corns strength appeared to stem in part from an agriculture 
department report that export sales of corn rose by nearly 12 
million metric tons last week 
indications that mexico bought some us corn overnight also 
prompted buying as did a usda decisision to extend for 12 months 
the 1985 corn and sorghum loans due to expire dec 31 the move may 
keep some grain in storage that would otherwise have come onto the 
market 
gains in the wheat market were limited by expectations for rain 
in us winter wheat areas early next week 
recent weakness in european soybean oil and meal markets kept a 
lid on the soybean market 
trading conditions were thin this morning with some traders 
taking a long thanksgiving weekend 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn

some economists say the changes sweeping eastern 
europe could be a boon to us credit markets with interest rates 
plunging and bond prices leaping as leaner defense budgets pare the 
federal deficit 
others point out a potential pitfall inthe liberalization of the 
east bloc the foreign investors who help fund the us deficit by 
buying treasury bonds may be tempted to invest their money in 
eastern europe instead causing a us credit crunch 
roger e brinner chief economist for the consulting firm 
drimcgraw hill inc is one of the optimists 
as the treasurys needs for funds drops so will the yields 
that theyre forced to pay he said last week if we cut back 
on defense and didnt spend it elsewhere we could have up to a 2 
percentage point drop in interest rates over the next five years 
that would be a 25 percent gain in the price of bonds 
brinner said his calculation is based on a rule of thumb that 
every 50 billion reduction in the federal deficit brings a 1 
percentage point drop in interest rates 
already there are signs that us defense spending will be cut 
to help ease the deficit and pay for expensive domestic programs 
president bush has promised such as fighting drug abuse improving 
education and reducing pollution 
reports that defense secretary dick cheney wants to trim defense 
spending by 180 billion over the next six years sent defense 
company stock prices plunging last week 
robert a brusca chief economist for nikko securities co 
international inc said the opening of the east bloc holds many 
pluses for the united states such as a vast new outlet for us 
products that could ease the nations trade deficit but he also 
points out potential trouble 
europe will tend to keep its own capital he wrote in a 
commentary last week capital from other parts of the world will 
flow there more freely too the us the worlds major 
foreigncapitaladdicted country could find itself starved for the 
capital it craves financial flows from japan will become ever more 
important to the us 
the potential for a disruption in flows is not a small 
matter he added the cold war is over but a deep chill of 
another sort may lie ahead 
steven hess an economist for first interstate bancorp in los 
angeles disputes bruscas contention 
i dont think the us government will have too much 
difficulty funding itself anymore than it already has because its 
going to clearly still be the benchmark for western markets he 
said 
i really think that investment in eastern europe in the near 
term is not going to be so great that it would have any effect on 
credit markets he added 
doug handler an economist at dun amp bradstreet corp said an 
investment in treasury bonds is not comparable to an investment in 
rebuilding eastern europe and so they probably are not be 
competing for the same funds 
treasury bonds often are used for shortterm investments such 
as currency hedging strategies he said those putting money in 
eastern europe most likely view it as a longterm investment 
handler also said a defense scaleback could have a negative 
effect on the us economy over the short term since it could 
result in layoffs in the defense industry 
these layoffs could depress the economy which in turn could 
reduce government revenue possibly canceling out any 
deficitreducing effect from the defense cuts 
however while a weaker economy wouldnt be good for the nation 
as a whole it would most likely benefit the bond market bond 
prices generally rise when the economy slackens on the assumption 
that the federal reserve board will ease interest rates it also 
benefits bonds by lessening fears of inflation 
theres another potential impact on western credit markets from 
the liberalization in the east the prospect that billions of 
dollars in bonds might be sold in the west by the soviet union and 
eastern european nations to finance their reconstruction 
in the past two years the soviet union has sold about 850 
million in bonds in europe hungary also has tapped western bond 
markets 
but the soviet union is barred from borrowing in this country 
until it clears up the matter of czarist russian debt obligations 
in the united states that the communist government reneged on after 
the russian revolution

the united states will allow a 135 percent 
increase in the amount of raw sugar that can be imported from 39 
countries in 1990 the agriculture department announced today 
this change in the level of the quota is necessary to 
alleviate a tightness in our sugar market caused by unexpectedly 
low ending stocks and a production shortfall said agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter 
the new import quota takes effect monday for the period that 
runs from jan 1 1989 through sept 30 1990 the quota was set 
at 226 million metric tons raw value up from 199 million metric 
tons for 1989 
quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can

japan on friday pledged a 150 million loan for 
poland and said it was considering other aid to poland and hungary 
to help relieve their economic crises and promote democratic reform 
the lowinterest loan would be used for polands currency 
stabilization program said mayumi moriyama the chief cabinet 
secretary 
japan is also considering loans through the exportimport bank 
to cover trade and investment insurance for hungary and is studying 
plans to provide emergency food aid to poland and technical 
assistance to both countries said kenzo oshima director of the 
aid policy division at the foreign ministry 
asked why japan was giving a loan rather than a grant oshima 
conceded poland probably would have been happier with a grant 
it is up to each country to decide what fits he said the 
us apparently felt a grant would be more preferable as far 
as japan is concerned we felt a concessional loan would meet if 
not 100 percent of their requirements at least an important part 
japan has said its relatively slow development of an aid package 
for eastern europe by saying the region is remote from japan and 
relations had not been important while those countries had little 
independence as members of the soviet bloc 
it cant be denied that part of the world is remote oshima 
said it is not something like china or korea to japan 
oshima said the 150 million loan would carry at most a 3 
percent interest rate and be repayable over 25 years with a 
sevenyear grace period the loan would be made if agreement is 
reached between poland and the international monetary fund on a 
plan to restructure the polish economy 
poland the only east bloc country led by a noncommunist has 
asked western countries to support its efforts to control 800 
percent inflation and to stabilize its currency 
western officials say poland faces a severe food shortage this 
winter without more assistance

more than 40000 models of a classic american 
toy have been recalled because paint used on them may contain too 
much lead according to the consumer product safety commission 
the agency also says hundreds of thousands of clown dolls are 
being recalled because they pose a choking hazard 
the makers of slinky animal pull toys a variation on the 
standard accordionlike wired toy are voluntarily recalling them 
because the red paint used on the eyes tongue and cheeks may 
contain a higher percentage of lead paint than the agency allows 
cpsc standards limit to 06 percent the lead content of paint 
used on childrens items 
the 43000 slinky toys sold since 1986 have red and white pull 
cords and come in the form of a train worm seal frog 
caterpillar dalmation and kitten they are made by james 
industries inc of hollidaysburg pa 
the cpsc also said 234000 dolls manufactured by the omahabased 
oriental trading co and sold through mail order catalogues as the 
dress up clown or funny clown were recalled because they 
have small parts that present a choking risk to young children 
the agency said the 13inch dolls used to teach children to 
dress themselves have zipper clasps buttons and buckles that came 
off during standard tests 
these small parts make the dolls banned hazardous substances 
because they present a choking ingestion and aspiration hazard to 
children the agency said in a written statement 
there have been no reported injuries associated with either toy 
consumers may return the toys to the place of purchase for a 
full refund

customers clutching credit cards and wish lists joined by 
children eager for a glimpse of santa claus crammed into stores 
around the country today in the traditional start of the 
postthanksgiving buying spree 
oldfashioned holiday spirit mixed with a hunger for bargains 
sent shoppers and browsers out in force promising to produce a day 
worthy of its billing as the busiest one of the year for merchants 
managers in many areas reported customers lined up outside 
waiting for stores to open a hopeful sign in the most crucial 
season of a year that so far has been slow for retailers 
at bloomingdales department store in manhattan customers lined 
up early in numbingly cold weather to get a jump on their holiday 
shopping and surged inside when the doors opened at 9 am 
were filling up with people rapidly bloomingdales 
spokeswoman ann stock said as always we expect this to be the 
busiest day of the year 
early shoppers at bloomingdales grabbed for mittens gloves 
scarves and hats others made a beeline for the coat department 
new yorks first thanksgiving snowfall in 51 years combined with 
subfreezing temperatures apparently put people in the mood to buy 
warm clothing 
shoppers streamed into suburban malls and downtowns nationwide 
hoping to get as much gift buying done as possible at the start of 
the peak shopping season big markdowns on merchandise at some 
troubled stores lured bargainhunters while shoppers elsewhere 
scanned the aisles for hardtofind items such as the popular 
nintendo video games 
the santa claus at raleigh ncs crabtree valley mall said 
most of the several dozen children that had confided their requests 
to him this morning asked for nintendo items 
the six b altman amp co department stores in new york new 
jersey and pennsylvania that are closing down financially 
struggling parent company hooker corp couldnt find a buyer for 
the chain drew hordes of people to their liquidation sales 
the crowd clamoring to get inside b altmans main store in 
manhattan was so heavy that shoppers had to be admitted in shifts 
were having an unbelievable day said brenda smith 
secretary for the manager at altmans at the mall at short hills in 
new jersey at the paramus nj mall an altmans employee said 
the store was so busy none of the managers were available to talk 
almost half of a retailers annual business is done in the weeks 
between thanksgiving and christmas 
most retailers and industry analysts are expecting this year to 
be a time of cautious spending on expensive longlasting goods 
such as home appliances overall retail sales are predicted to rise 
only about 55 percent over last year compared with 1988s 
surprisingly strong 9 percent gain 
typically there is a crush of shopping done in the days just 
after thanksgiving and then a long lull until the final frantic 
days just before christmas 
merchants in many places were providing incentives to people 
that showed up early 
in new orleans early arrivers to st charles street were 
offered coffee and donuts one large department store in sioux 
falls sd offered special prizes inside cracker jack boxes for 
early arrivals 
shirley larsen a clerk at a sioux falls clothing store said 
we always have merchandise on sale but today in order to get 
people to come in there are coupons were handing out at the 
door she said 
the acadiana mall in lafayette la brimmed with shoppers by 
midmorning and marketing director sherry bouttee fretted that the 
parking lot might not be able to handle the holiday traffic

for appointing pursers in which candidates for the jobs are placed

used until now 
sas management has refused to reconsider its decision on hiring

a 1 billion infusion is putting panda motor 
corp chinas largest foreignfunded investment project on track 
to begin auto production by the end of next year an official news 
report said friday 
american panda motor co which is affiliated with south koreas 
unification church is investing 1 billion in the project which 
will produce 300000 cars a year all for export by 1995 the 
peoples daily said 
chinese government reports said previously that us investors 
were contributing 250 million to the project 
the peoples daily said investors from 20 countries and 
regions were involved in the project but gave no further 
details 
the panda motor factory is being built in huizhou a small city 
east of canton the capital of southern guangdong province 
american panda motor has its head office in arlington va one 
of its main backers is charles kim a koreanamerican who formerly 
was with the us small business administration according to 
officials in beijing and canton 
little else is known about american panda the officials say 
theyre tied in with the tongil unification group said a 
foreign commercial official in beijing the tongil group is headed 
by rev sunmyung moon leader of the wealthy unification church of 
south korea 
but american panda has yet to tie up with anyone to provide 
equipment to make cars said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity nobody has signed on with them to provide marketing 
rights or stamping equipment and so on 
foreigners with some familiarity with the project question the 
ventures ability to obtain parts in china as well as demand on the 
world market for chinesemade cars 
almost no chinese can afford private automobiles and few can be 
exported because cars made in china rely heavily on imported parts 
and are not costcompetitive on the international market 
the peoples daily said workers were busy with the first stage 
of construction an assembly factory paint shop administrative 
building and parking lot 
but no ones aware of any developments in huizhou said the 
commercial official noting that the companys plans largely are a 
mystery any firm which pulls out a billion dollars and says 
theyre going to make 300000 cars a year should at least come up 
with some basic facts but no one has been able to provide those 
facts 
no foreign carmaker including any from south korea has come 
forward as any form of partner the official said though in 
infrequent conversations with panda representatives in canton 
theyve mentioned just about every auto manufacturer 
official chinese reports in september said huizhou planned to 
borrow roughly 54 million to build power generating plants docks 
and other facilities needed for the factory 
the project contradicts the chinese governments attempts to 
consolidate the slumping auto industry under central planners in 
beijing 
last year the state council chinas cabinet announced it no 
longer would approve auto manufacturing joint ventures and 
cooperation and that passenger car production would be confined to 
six major manufacturers 
those six are the first automotive works in the northern city of 
jilin which makes audis in cooperation with volkswagen the second 
automotive works in central hubei province the japanbacked 
tianjin automotive industry corp the shanghai volkswagen auto 
co the beijing jeep corp a subsidiary of chrysler corp and 
the guangzhou canton peugeot automobile co 
chinese officials have said they hope to produce up to 600000 
passenger cars this year china produced 33000 passenger cars last 
year and 39000 in the first half of this year 
the governments current austerity plan which includes 
forbidding most staterun institutions from purchasing cars has 
led to plunging sales and soaring inventories

gasoline prices could dip slightly in 
coming months if opec fails to cap its surging oil production 
analysts said friday 
us pump prices could tumble 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon over 
the next three months without restraint by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries said allen sinai chief economist at 
the new york investment firm of boston co 
mari buglass an oil analyst at shearson lehman hutton in 
london predicted that retail gasoline prices would be likely to 
stay static or become slightly softer for consumers 
whether they go up or down hinges in part on the outcome of 
negotiations among members of the 13nation oil cartel which 
begins its winter conference on saturday 
the ministers started preliminary meetings on thursday of the 
committee that monitors world oil prices then talked privately 
friday in their hotel rooms 
we are trying to find a solution said saudia arabias 
hisham nazer in early evening we are making progressthere are 
various options being considered 
opec secretarygeneral subroto described the ministers work as 
an informationseeking and solutionseeking exercise 
there are many things that are being explored right now he 
said 
during their talks the ministers must work out a new pricing 
and production accord in line with world demand for opec oil 
forecasted to slow in the 1990 first quarter 
they also must try to find a way to halt persistent quota 
cheating by kuwait and the united arab emirates each producing 
about double their opec allotments of 11 million barrels a day to 
press demands for higher shares 
the extra production has raised the cartels output above 23 
million barrels a day sharply higher than opecs ceiling of 205 
million barrels and well above the 217 million barrel average 1990 
world demand forecast by the cartels own economic experts 
despite the excess prices have remained fairly steady due to 
strong demand particularly by developing countries 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec was 
1716 a barrel from january through the third week of october when 
it reached 1776 
opecs target price is 18 a barrel a year ago the opec basket 
registered 1234 
futures prices for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
american crude which usually averages about 2 more than the opec 
basket have been in the 20abarrel range 
nevertheless some cartel members see a need to curtail opecs 
burgeoning production soon 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said late 
thursday that the cartels production ceiling could increase but 
definitely not by more than one million barrels a day to 215 
million barrels 
many analysts believe the ministers will bump up the official 
production ceiling to that level in the first half of 1990 
divvying it up proportionately among all members even though it 
likely would not satisfy kuwait and the united arab emirates 
analysts said there was not enough pressure from weak prices to 
force the ministers to come up with a novel solution or make tough 
compromises in the quota dispute 
what does it do to oil prices asked fergus macleod oil 
analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london not a lot they 
might fall some but very slightly 
ginandjar said he wasnt worried about prices i dont see any 
reason why prices should collapse 
ms buglass said if they can be seen to reduce actual 
production the market will take heart 
but an inconclusive meeting she said could mean price erosion 
a confusing outcome along with a sagging us economy could 
send oil prices down by about a dollar or two a barrel sinai said 
but he added that he doubted the meeting would end on a false 
note 
opec has managed since november 1988 to control supply and the 
perception of supply enough to keep prices up he said 
every dollar change in the price of a barrel of oil amounts to 
about a fivecent change in gasoline prices 
us gasoline prices shot up a seasonally adjusted 09 percent 
in october the biggest gain since a 39 percent upward jolt in may 
gasoline prices have been on a seesaw this year going up by 
212 percent in the first five months of the year and then falling 
by 93 percent from june through september

battled the bedlam to purchase a designer suit on the second floor 
its a real mess downstairs a disaster said al bellow of 
bayside queens who plunked down next to a mannequin to await his 
daughter 
drawn by the wellpublicized clearance sale officially 
beginning on the traditional biggest shopping day of the year 
about 2000 customers massed outside the flagship store on fifth 
avenue and 34th street before the doors opened at 10 am 
shouldertoshoulder crowds reminiscent of subway rushhour 
flooded the main floor new waves were allowed in periodically 
perfume i need chanel yelped one frenzied shopper unfazed 
by the cacophony 
im flabbergasted at the number of people said charlie 
miller director of housekeeping and maintenance who provided 
crowdcontrol and directed the onslaught on the second floor 
the escalators were turned off from the main floor to the second 
floor but the line to walk up them was still about a quarter block 
long 
look at this no one is moving the elevators are packed 
hundreds of people are lined up for them said a manhattan 
resident who would not give her name 
she was determined to walk to the eighth floor if necessary in 
search of a baby blanket i wouldnt think of buying a baby gift 
anywhere else she said 
throughout the store cheery christmas decorations were 
interspersed with red and white signs that read everything must 
go regardless of cost 
its very sad for us especially when its decorated for 
christmas said miller a jersey city nj resident who has 
worked at b altmans for 30 years i think the store has never 
looked better we worked our hearts out we thought it would stay 
open

corp could not find a buyer

im very very sorry to see it closing its one of the last 
traditions in new york city agreed wendy goidell of manhattan 
who has shopped there about 20 years

valhalla who was there for the opening but left emptyhanded 
this is not what i consider a sale 
gridlock gripped streets around the white plains store some 
motorists waited up to an hour to get into the parking lot others 
parked blocks away and braved icy sidewalks employees at 
neighboring neimanmarcus struggled to get to work and find parking

sharply grains and soybeans mostly were lower and energy futures 
were mixed 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 760 to 8

highest close since last dec 13

588 a troy ounce 
golds advance its fifth consecutive daily rise largely was a 
response to higher prices overnight in europe where investors are 
growing increasingly uneasy over the rapid pace of political 
changes in eastern europe 
as one communist government after another bends to public 
demands for reform investors there feel theyre on a political 
bog and theyre getting panicky said bruce kaplan president of 
kaplan amp co a preciousmetals dealer in santa monica calif 
european investors have become big buyers of gold analysts 
said because they perceive the metal as a safe haven for assets 
during troubled economic times 
for most of the session the new york gold market mirrored the 
4 to 650 gains made earlier in london but prices spurted higher 
late in the session following news that communist part chief milos 
jakes and the rest of czechoslovakias communist leadership had 
resigned following more than a week of huge protests 
in the united states the upheaval in eastern europe is widely 
seen as sign of easing tensions between the east and west 
but from a european standpoint you dont know if youre going 
to have a civil war or a revolution its quite unstable said 
craig sloane a metals analyst with smith barney harris upham amp 
co you dont know from one day to the next which government is 
going to resign 
changes in eastern europe continued to support pork futures 
prices friday on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the us government bought 280000 pounds of pork bellies 
wednesday to ship to poland as part of a foodaid package and a 
recent yugoslavian purchase 150000 metric tons of bellies has 
stirred hopes for more sales of us pork to eastern europe

cattle futures markets

contract for delivery in december at 7607 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 05 cent to 42 cent higher with november at 8370

republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid for gold at 
41290 an ounce up 290

in new york the dollar traded at 18010 marks down from 
181275 marks late wednesday louis quilici a dealer with harris 
trust amp co in chicago said that was the lowest since early

to raise interest rates to keep its economy from overheating it is 
widely believed that west german growth will accelerate as east 
germans continue to pour into the country following the recent 
reforms in that country 
higher west german interest rates would raise returns on 
markdenominated investments and spur demand for marks 
meanwhile concerns that us interest rates would fall due to 
weakness in the economy also helped depress the dollar dealers 
said

the day off or leaving early to extend their thanksgiving day

measures 
the annual growth rate in m2 so far this year is 42 percent

the annual growth rate in m3 is 39 percent within the feds

golds move up and over 400 an ounce this past week was good 
fortune for gold producers down under 
the gold surge coincided with the australian governments 
heavily hyped us launch of its redesigned 1ounce gold and 
platinum bullion coins 
so perfectly did the events mesh that its almost as if 
someone is looking out for the australians said bruce kaplan 
president of kaplan amp co a preciousmetals dealer in santa 
monica calif 
analysts consistently have cited investment demand as the main 
factor behind golds dramatic runup from less than 360 an ounce 
since midseptember 
the rally gained speed after the stock markets 190point tumble 
on oct 13 and shifted into high gear this past week cracking the 
psychologically important 400 level on tuesday with surprising 
ease 
it kind of broke through 400 and never looked back said 
fred demler metals economist with drexel burnham lambert inc in 
new york 
gold for december delivery on new yorks commodity exchange 
settled at 41930 a troy ounce friday compared with 39580 a week 
earlier fridays price established a new high for the year 
december silver rose to 588 a troy ounce from 5685 on the 
commodity exchange during the week while platinum for january 
delivery on the new york mercantile exchange climbed to 54470 a 
troy ounce from 52660 
dealers say the rise in precious metal values has sparked a 
substantial increase in sales of gold bullion coins such as the 
us eagle the canadian maple leaf and the australian nugget 
representatives of goldcorp australia a company formed by the 
australian government to market the kangaroo nugget and its 
platinum counterpart the koala were in the united states 
promoting the newly redesigned coins when gold passed the 400 
milestone 
goldcorp chairman donald mackaycoghill said that while he had 
no sales figures we have made very significant sales into the 
market im delighted with the sales weve made 
market analysts say the increased investment demand for gold 
indicates uneasiness among investors worldwide about the us 
economy and the political changes sweeping eastern europe gold 
often is perceived as a safe investment haven during troubled 
economic times 
the news on friday that czechoslovakias communist leaders had 
resigned appeared to lend new strength to the gold market 
gold prices have risen so sharply in the past six weeks that an 
increasing number of analysts are predicting a selloff in the near 
future but others say the market has potential to climb 
considerably higher 
craig sloane of smith barney harris upham amp co said european 
markets have been leading the rally and that when gold prices 
falter overseas the us market will stall as well 
william oneill research director for elders futures inc said 
he was keeping an eye on gold producers who largely have been 
absent from the market 
one key factor that could halt the rally is if producers 
decided the market has reached a level where they want to be 
aggressive sellers he said

it was hard to gauge the effect of the protests on business but 
most shop owners dismissed the protests as merely annoying 
we have had very good sales at this time of year as usual so 
i dont believe it has changed at all said christina delgado 
manager of rosina malta fashions in miami where the front door was 
painted red by vandals 
in seattle half a dozen fur store workers and mink farm owners 
held a counterdemonstration with signs proclaiming the right to 
wear fur next door to a shopping center protest by 35 animal rights 
activists jeff craggs owner of blue granite fur farm said 
animals are used for food medical research and circuses so furs 
shouldnt be singled out by protesters 
in new york standing behind barker was gary kaskel of 
manhattan who walked with his two pet fitch ferrets which are 
related to the mink and are often used for furs 
its a good image to let people see the animals alive said 
kaskel petting the animals people dont see the animals in the 
traps so you have to let em see them alive see how sweet they 
are 
in front of kaskel five women dressed as skeletons marched 
carrying a sign which said fur is dead others in the crowd 
which stretched for four blocks held signs reading fake people 
wear real fur and fur belongs on its real back 
protester nancy winters a manhattan novelist said she put away 
all her furs including a sable you would die for after 
rethinking the issue last year 
there were few confrontations between the marchers and 
furwearing shoppers one woman in a fur coat was taunted with 
chants of shame and vanity but she ignored the shouts 
there were no arrests 
barker who resigned as host of the miss usa pageant over its 
award of a fur to the winner criticized the nations fur farms as 
animal concentration camps a charge which infuriated a 
spokesman for the fur industry 
that kind of spurious allegation is entirely without any basis 
in fact said bob buckler executive director of the fur farm 
animal welfare coalition the fact is animals raised on american 
fur farms receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals 
in the world 
workers at grove cleaners and furriers in miami on friday 
arrived to find red and blue paint covering the front windows and 
graffiti on a van parked out front in a fashionable section of 
coconut grove 
i dont think thats right they have a right to express 
themselves but i dont think they should vandalize the store 
said alfonso zequeira who owns the shop 
in addition to ms delgados nearby shop two fur shops in fort 
lauderdale also were vandalized 
a spokeswoman for the animals rights foundation of florida 
nanci alexander denied responsibility for the vandalism blaming 
it on furriers trying to make the protest groups look bad

isuzu now makes the geo storm subcompact car for gm the car is 
sold through the us automakers chevrolet dealers

leveraged buyouts that have taken many companies 
out of public hands slowed considerably in 1989 but the megabuyout 
of rjr nabisco inc catapulted the food and tobacco giant to the 
no 3 spot on forbes magazines list of 400 largest private 
companies in america 
forbes said in its dec 11 issue that only 16 entries on the 
list went private this year in leveraged buyouts down from 49 
companies last year 
forbes ranked the 400 largest private firms according to their 
estimated or reported total sales during the most recent fiscal 
year 
cargill the international marketer of agricultural and bulk 
commodities topped the list for the fifth straight year 
minneapolisbased cargill reported 1988 revenue of 43 billion 
up 5 billion from the previous year and more than double that of 
the second largest company on the list koch industries the 
wichita kanbased oil company with sales of 16 billion 
forbes estimated rjr nabisco had sales of 14 billion last year 
ranking it third after the company was taken private by the new 
york buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the 30 billion 
leveraged buyout was the biggest corporate takeover ever 
a leveraged buyout is a corporate acquisition financed mainly 
with borrowed funds that are repaid with cash from the target 
companys cash flow or the sale of its assets the technique has 
raised concerns from some critics who believe such debtburdened 
companies are more likely to fail during an economic downturn 
leading to layoffs and other problems 
forbes defined a private company as one that has no publicly 
traded stock there are about 7 million private us companies 
compared with roughly 10000 firms that are public 
there were 37 supermarket chains on the forbes list led by

lawyers for former automaker john z de lorean 
whose belfastbased car company went bankrupt in 1982 won a high 
court order friday setting aside an english court order against him 
for more than 51 million 
judge peter gibson overturned a july 1987 court order that 
allowed legal documents in the case to be served on de lorean at 
his home in new jersey outside the jurisdiction of the english 
courts 
it follows that all subsequent orders made against mr de 
lorean will fall away gibson said 
the ruling was the latest stage in a dispute between the 
liquidators of dsq property co ltd incorporated in northern 
ireland and formerly called de lorean motor cars ltd and de 
lorean 
unstated damages had been claimed against de lorean for alleged 
conspiracy deceit and breach of fiduciary duty gibson said 
in june 1988 the high court entered judgment against de lorean 
ordering him to pay more than 51 million 
gibson said de lorean took no part in the english proceedings 
until this year when dsq sought to enforce the judgment in the 
united states 
on july 10 de lorean issued a high court summons seeking to set 
aside the order allowing service in the united states any service 
of documents under that order and all subsequent orders made 
against him 
the application was opposed by dsq which went into receivership 
in 1982 and had since been put into liquidation 
gibson ruled that in dsqs application to serve documents on de 
lorean outside english jurisdiction there had been serious 
nondisclosures of matters including the existence of 
proceedings against de lorean in the united states unrelated to dsq 
and his likely defense 
dsq which was ordered to pay de loreans legal costs was 
allowed to appeal gibsons ruling which was suspended pending the 
appeal 
de lorean a former general motors co executive set up his 
plant in belfast in 1978 employing more than 2600 workers at its 
peak 
the british government hoping to ease high unemployment in the 
city lost 140 million in the venture when the gullwing sports 
cars found few buyers 
in 1982 de lorean was arrested in los angeles on charges of 
drug running but acquitted two years later of conspiring to 
distribute 24 million worth of cocaine in the united states in a 
bid to raise money for saving the failing car company
