the use of dna identification to link suspects 
to crimes is being successfully challenged by defense attorneys in 
a small but growing number of cases 
at issue are the reliability of the tests and the way they are 
conducted 
in the last year i am aware of at least seven or eight cases 
where after the defense got an expert involved the prosecution has 
withdrawn the evidence says lawyer peter neufeld who 
successfully challenged dna test results in a new york city murder 
case last summer 
the judge in the case cited problems with the laboratory 
analysis 
since it was first introduced in a us criminal court in 1987 
dna testing has been presented in 200 cases in at least 36 states 
the fbi opened its own dna lab in late 1988 to test samples for 
state and local police departments since then bureau experts have 
presented evidence that has helped convict 44 people 
with everything we have seen so far we are gaining confidence 
in the dna identifications utility in serving the criminal justice 
community said john hicks head of the fbis laboratory division 
the tests compare genetic material extracted from tissue or body 
fluids found at crime scenes with dna from a suspects blood 
while law enforcement authorities hail dna identification 
defense lawyers have won several victories by exposing what courts 
found to be flaws in testing procedures 
among them 
the minnesota supreme court refused in november to admit dna 
test results in a murder case saying the laboratory of cellmark 
diagnostics in germantown md did not meet standards for 
scientific reliability 
in december prosecutors in maine were forced to withdraw dna 
evidence in a sexual assault case and drop charges 
defense experts testified there were flaws in procedures used by 
lifecodes corp of valhalla ny to match dna in the defendants 
blood with that extracted from a semen sample taken at the crime 
scene 
on march 8 a judge presiding over an oregon rape case refused 
to admit dna test results from the fbi lab ruling there was too 
much scientific controversy over the tests reliability and too 
much danger of confusing jurors with technical details 
spokesmen at the two commercial dna laboratories defended their 
procedures as did hicks 
hicks said computer imaging at the fbi lab ensures that a match 
is properly read by the tester in addition two examiners must 
find that the dna patterns match before positive results are 
declared he said 
michael baird director of forensic testing at lifecodes said 
the court decisions have not discredited the technique or the 
procedures track record 
we are talking about whether the approach itself is correct as 
opposed to whats being done in a particular case baird said 
there have been situations where portions of the evidence were 
not ruled admissible but the technology itself has been 
admissible 
the issue is not so much should it be accepted as evidence but 
how and under what circumstances said janlori goldman a staff 
attorney for the american civil liberties unions privacy project 
dna testing isnt exclusively a weapon for prosecutors 
of more than 500 tests completed by the fbi 36 percent excluded 
the suspect in question hicks said 
public defenders in washington commissioned dna tests that 
recently exonerated a man whose rape conviction was overturned 
because his dna did not match that taken from a semen stain found 
on the womans clothing 
thousands of other tests performed by cellmark and lifecodes 
have exonerated defendants or encouraged them to plead guilty said 
mark storolow a spokesman for cellmark 
as a form of evidence it must be very very powerful because 
it results in a lot of plea bargaining he said 
rape cases are the most common application of dna testing in 
criminal investigations because hospitals routinely take semen 
samples from victims 
the test can also be useful in solving murders enabling police 
to determine for example that blood on a suspects clothing was 
from the victim it also is used for paternity tests 
when it goes to the identity of the person thats when its 
particularly relevant said jay b stephens the us attorney in 
washington 
to check for a match scientists use enzymes to cut dna 
strands into small pieces and place them on laboratory gelatin the 
fragments move along the gelatin and form patterns similar to the 
pricecode bars on supermarket merchandise 
each person except for identical twins has a singular genetic 
makeup so the pattern should be unique 
based on the size of the test sample and data taken from dna 
tests drawn from samplings of the population scientists calculate 
the odds against a pattern being repeated 
neufeld and other lawyers argue that laboratories use 
lessthanobjective criteria for deciding that two dna patterns 
match 
in the maine case expert witnesses questioned the procedures 
lifecodes used to adjust for a phenomenon called bandshifting 
in which the fragments do not move evenly along the gelatin 
thomas caskey a medical professor who is starting a dna lab at 
baylor university in houston dismisses those who question the 
reliability of tests 
it is extremely easy to determine whether one has a match 
between the suspect and the forensic specimen he said 
but neufeld argues that like other scientific evidence dna 
should be subject to rigorous court scrutiny particularly if its 
used to determine if a person is going to prison

judge stanley sporkin leans way back in his 
swivel chair pops another chunk of ice from a paper cup into his 
mouth stares at the ceiling 
he is presiding over a hearing into a dicey enormously costly 
matter but you couldnt tell it by his demeanor 
he stretches he yawns he slumps he wears his halfframe 
glasses on his forehead he chews ice 
at his side millionaire charles h keating jr is the witness 
laying out his claim that clumsy overzealous regulators foolishly 
seized his lincoln savings and loan association an act likely to 
cost taxpayers 25 billion left alone it would have prospered 
keating says 
moreover according to keating the larger sampl crisis is of the 
governments own making he claims regulators took control of sampls 
that could have survived ruined the business and needlessly put a 
multibilliondollar load on taxpayers backs 
the estimated cost of the bailout has just been raised to 325 
billion including interest payments for 40 years there goes the 
peace dividend some say 
sporkin a us district court judge has to decide whether to 
let keatings claim come to trial 
keating tall trim squareshouldered wearing rimless glasses 
looks like a sunday school superintendent 
he is famous for three tactics filing suits spending what is 
necessary to get what he wants and hiring his antagonists often 
at big salaries 
his very name raises goosebumps on political skin five senators 
are hurting because they accepted 13 million in campaign 
contributions from keating then met with him to hear his 
complaints about heavyhanded federal regulators 
keating didnt help them when taking note of the rumors that 
his money influenced several political figures to take up my 
cause he said i certainly hope so 
whatever aid he got from the senators it was not enough to 
prevent the takeover of his sampl empire based in california 
the regulators declared keatings highflying tactics made 
lincoln unsafe and unsound and put its depositors at risk their 
money dissipated in junk bond gambles they said he used a complex 
tax scheme to funnel lincolns deposits into his arizona real 
estate ventures 
his testimony is peppered with aggressive words 
preposterous reckless vendetta he says the 
examination of his books by the federal home loan bank board was 
vicious even savage 
he says he ran a nontraditional sampl he says the government 
was out to destroy him he says the us league of savings 
institutions resentful of the competition lobbied against him 
on the stand thursday to prove evil motivation he cited a memo 
from one regulator 
even our lawyers are finally getting the message it said 
under every document is another scam and they seem to finally 
understand what type of thieves we are dealing with and why we need 
to get them out 
keating brought out that the author of the memo kevin 
oconnell is the son of the william b oconnell who was 
president of the league at the time kevin oconnell a witness for 
the government was seated at the government table 
sporkin acted like a man who could not believe his ears he 
chuckled he pointed to the younger oconnell 
it was this gentlemans father who was president of the us 
league he asked unbelievingly 
oconnell said nothing later he told reporters the memo was 
selfexplanatory 
if sporkin rules in keatings favor the entire sampl bailout 
could be thrown into question it would lend credence to keatings 
view that sampl takeovers created a glutted real estate market 
jeopardizing additional sampls which saw the value of their 
mortgages fall 
the government asked sporkin to quash keatings suit a motion 
which could be routinely disposed of sporkin set aside two days 
for a hearing then he set aside six more days now the hearing 
had run through its 23rd day 
between these two keating and sporkin has developed a rapport 
courtroom spectators say sporkin understands finances an 
accountant before he was a lawyer he was chief of enforcement at 
the securities and exchange commission and chief counsel to the cia 
before he became a judge 
keating is solicitous to him before the house banking 
committee keating exercised his fifth amendment rights to remain 
silent but is eager to make his case in sporkins court 
every so often up pops james murphy the lawyer hired to 
represent the office of thrift supervision successor agency to the 
home loan bank board 
he argues that keating keeps veering into areas that have no 
relevance this is a hearing on a motion not a trial 
sporkin waves him off im just listening and i believe i have 
a responsibility to listen he tells murphy plus he says 
grinning its a lot more interesting than a lot of things i have 
to listen to

police on sunday were investigating whether a 
cab driver found shot to death in his taxi was the fourth victim of 
a serial killer 
rafael montes de oca 38 was found in his car at 1155 pm 
saturday in the bronx police said he was shot in the head at 
close range as were three other private carservice drivers killed 
in the bronx since march 7 
police had not ruled out that the killer believed responsible 
for the previous three slayings may have struck again said police 
spokesman hugh barry 
but police at the 48th precinct which is investigating the 
latest killing were leaning against connecting it to the others 
there are certain consistencies in the other cases which are 
not present in this one said lt james malvey the precinct 
commander we became convinced there is no connection 
a detective in the precinct said investigators were treating the 
latest slaying as a separate incident but theyre not ruling a 
connection out definitely its too soon the detective spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a task force of more than 30 officers formed last week to probe 
the homicides was investigating the montes de oca killing barry 
said 
it was not immediately determined if any money had been stolen 
before the killing 
a fifth cab driver dennis forbes was shot during a robbery 
wednesday and died the next day but his death was not believed to 
be related to the others detectives said montes de oca and the 
other three slain drivers had all received calls to pick up 
passengers while forbes picked up a passenger on the street 
montes de oca had worked for seaman car services of manhattan 
for about two years 
he had gone to a bronx address to pick up a passenger said 
leslie rivera a seaman dispatcher we didnt hear from him 
since she said we were notified by another driver that he was 
shot 
she said montes de oca had a pregnant wife and four children 
everybody here is devastated said raul morel another 
dispatcher 
like other cab companies seaman has lost taxi drivers because 
of fear instilled by the string of killings ten to 15 percent of 
its 350 drivers no longer work at night rivera said 
everybody takes extra measures but what can you do morel 
said the only precaution that we take is when you see the 
people if you see a person that you dont like you dont take 
them 
mayor david dinkins offered a 10000 reward on thursday for 
information leading to the killer or killers 
the guardian angels meanwhile announced that one member of the 
group would begin riding with each driver for two car services on 
their overnight runs sunday night 
we look upon these car services as the lifeline in these 
communities said lisa sliwa of the angels a volunteer group 
known for its red berets and controversial crimefighting tactics 
without them theres no way for people like nurses who work late 
to get around

underground fuel tanks belonging to 
a sect that built huge bomb shelters in anticipation of an 
apocalypse have begun leaking jeopardizing a nearby trout fishery 
state officials said saturday 
the leaks at the church universal triumphants 750person 
underground bomb shelter amounting to as much as 20000 gallons so 
far pose a major threat to the fishery near the northern border of 
yellowstone national park authorities said 
were putting on a fullcourt press as an administration 
said steve yeakel chief of staff for gov stan stephens 
yeakel said the increasingly large spill had become very 
serious and the state planned to go to court monday for an 
injunction to force the controversial religious group to focus all 
its resources on repairing the damage already done and averting 
further contamination 
small amounts of the fuel have reached mol heron creek but no 
major damage has occurred so far officials said saturday night 
the creek is considered a blueribbon fishery and one of the 
last remaining cutthroat trout spawning areas along the upper 
yellowstone river 
the church has been preparing for nuclear armageddon and its 
local population has mushroomed since its spiritual leader 
elizabeth clare prophet warned members that march and april are 
dangerous times she suggested they come to montana to prepare for 
a possible nuclear war or accident 
the sect sponsors two housing developments at emigrant in 
southwestern montana where park county officials say as many as 45 
private underground fallout shelters exist 
initially church officials disclosed that 4000 gallons of 
diesel fuel leaked last tuesday from a 20000gallon underground 
storage tank and a largescale cleanup was under way 
on friday night state officials learned of a second leaking 
tank and by early saturday had been advised that from 10000 to 
12000 gallons of unleaded gasoline had leaked into the soil 
by saturday evening park county officials said church officials 
had told them about a third leaking tank and of church plans to 
launch a major effort to pump out and exhume all buried fuel tanks 
doug rogness of the states underground storage tank program 
said previously that the church had registered 35 underground tanks 
at the bomb shelter complex within the last six months he said 
they had a total capacity of 634500 gallons of diesel fuel 
unleaded and regular gasoline 
also buried on the site are a number of 30000gallon propane 
storage tanks 
its a helluva mess said steve pilcher chief of the 
states water quality bureau the bomb shelter site is a 
disaster anyway 
he said that latest estimates put the total leakage at between 
12000 and 20000 gallons of fuel and 15000 gallons is 
unaccounted for and going downhill near the creek 
he said a fuel sheen began showing up on the creek about 
noon friday but so far leakage reaching the creek had been 
minimal the fuel absorbed into the soil however poses a 
significant threat to the fishery were going to do everything 
possible to see that doesnt happen 
yeakel said park county officials had been told the state would 
put all necessary resources at its disposal if necessary 
he said state officials were mobilizing to go into court early 
monday to seek injunctions that the first order of business is 
that the tanks will be pumped out and removed and that things are 
repaired 
the state also was being asked to call upon the federal 
environmental protection agency to become involved 
church members and workers from an environmental cleanup company 
were working frantically in kneedeep mud to recapture some of the 
leaked fuel pilcher said

renegade leaders of the december coup 
attempt on saturday threatened to do battle with the united states 
if washington intervenes in philippine affairs 
if the us government is ready and willing to have another 
vietnam experience then the mutineers together with the filipino 
people are willing to give them a fight that they will never 
forget said a statement by the revolutionary alliance for the 
massessoldiers of the filipino people 
us jets helped put down the dec 19 coup attempt that killed 
113 people and was believed led by the alliance american officials 
have repeatedly voiced support for president corazon aquino who 
has survived six armed attempts to topple her 4yearold 
administration 
the us government will be solely responsible for whatever 
actions we might consider to take against them said the rebel 
statement distributed near a military headquarters for as long 
as they leave us filipinos alone in settling our internal problems 
then they are not our enemy 
us embassy spokeswoman victoria middleton refused to comment 
on the statement until us authorities received a copy last week 
the us state department warned americans of a heightened 
terrorist threat in the philippines during the easter holidays 
the statement was issued amid rumors of a new plot to oust mrs 
aquino late saturday progovernment troops manned positions near 
the headquarters of the philippine armed forces in suburban quezon 
city and the nearby headquarters of the national police 
armored personnel carriers were deployed at gasoline stations 
near the sprawling camps which were attacked by mutineers during 
decembers failed coup 
also saturday soldiers arrested a leader of the december coup 
near his house in sorsogon province 370 miles southeast of manila 
a military report said 
the military said capt leovic dioneda administrative officer 
of the philippine constabulary was charged with commandeering two 
passenger buses and reinforcing rebel troops during the coup 
attempt 
officials said dioneda jumped from a window when troops arrived 
but was captured after a brief chase 
he is among the more than 2200 mutineers in military custody 
eightyone officers have been charged in the december coup 
in another development a separate renegade group on saturday 
threatened to attack suspected british mercenaries allegedly 
training mrs aquinos security forces 
the warning by the young officers union came in an open letter 
for the british embassy dated friday copies were sent to news 
agencies 
rebels said british military instructors last wednesday and 
thursday joined troops from mrs aquinos security forces in 
staging mock attacks on the palace the manila international 
airport and the house of representatives building 
the rebel group claimed its forces had identified the alleged 
british mercenaries it urged the british embassy to order them 
to leave the philippines saying otherwise they would face 
drastic action 
assistant press secretary horacio paredes confirmed that 
presidential guards conducted an exercise on those days but refused 
to say if british instructors took part the british embassy was 
closed saturday for the easter holidays 
the young officers union is believed to be an offshoot of the 
reform the armed forces movement which has recently taken the name 
revolutionary alliance for the masses 
both groups claim mrs aquinos government is incompetent and 
corrupt mrs aquino says the rebels simply want to grab power from 
her elected administration which came to power after the 1986 
popular revolt that ousted president ferdinand marcos

a driver for a private car service was fatally 
shot at close range in the bronx borough of new york late saturday 
the fifth such killing in five weeks police said 
police were investigating whether the driver was the victim of 
the same robber believed responsible for three of the earlier 
slayings 
the driver was found dead in his car at 1155 pm in the 
fordham section of the bronx said sgt nick vreeland a police 
spokesman 
the victim rafael montes de oca 38 of the bronx was shot in 
the head at close range vreeland said he would not immediately 
say how many times the victim had been shot 
the driver who worked for seaman car services in manhattan had 
picked up a passenger who called for a ride said leslie rivera a 
seaman dispatcher 
we didnt hear from him since she said we were notified 
by another driver that he was shot 
rivera described the victim as a good family man and a good 
fellow worker he had four children and his wife is pregnant 
she added 
carservice drivers were shot to death in the bronx on march 7 
march 14 and april 9th after receiving calls to pick up a 
passenger in the early morning hours 
investigators believe the three were the victims of the same 
person because the drivers were all shot many times in the face and 
neck with a 22 caliber gun each had been robbed of between 50

you wont be through with taxes for the year 
even if you beat the midnight monday deadline for filing your 
federal return the average american will have to work through may 
5 to satisfy the tax collectors 
if that prediction by the tax foundation proves accurate it 
will be the latest tax freedom day on record and two days later 
than 1989 
the reason is simple the nonpartisan research organization said 
sunday in announcing the mythical date tax increases will 
outpace the growth in individuals income during 1990 
tax freedom day is the foundations estimate of how long it 
would take an average person to pay his or her state federal and 
local taxes if all income went for taxes until they were all paid 
for the year 1990 
the calculations assume that all taxes are paid by individuals 
including those collected from corporations 
until this year the latest date was may 4 1981 before a big 
tax reduction took effect the foundation said subsequent watering 
down of several deductions increases in social security taxes and 
state and local taxes and a gradual economic slowing will have 
wiped out that reduction 
for the millions of couples and individuals still struggling 
with 1989 returns the internal revenue service announced that its 
tollfree telephone service would remain open late monday night to 
answer technical tax questions 
the postal service said most post offices in cities with at 
least 30000 population planned to station clerks at curbside to 
receive returns 
neither the irs nor the postal service estimated how many 
returns were likely to be filed monday night however the irs said 
it expects to receive about 23 million this week or one of every 
five that will be filed this year 
about 6 million couples and individuals unable to file their 
returns on time were expected to receive a fourmonth extension by 
filing form 4868 instead the extension is automatic but only if 
form 4868 is accompanied by a check for estimated taxes owed 
another 650000 or so americans abroad including military 
personnel qualified automatically for a twomonth extension just 
by having their main business home or duty station outside the 
united states and puerto rico 
a number of people have tax years that ended on days other than 
dec 31 1989 and thus have other filing deadlines still others 
will simply miss the filing deadline do nothing about it and 
subject themselves to separate penalties for filing late and paying 
late 
taxpayers who file their returns with the irs service center in 
andover mass residents of new england and most of upstate new 
york have until midnight tuesday to file that is because monday 
is patriots day a legal holiday in massachusetts 
when all the returns are counted later this year they are 
expected to total 111 million an increase of about 1 million from 
1989 
about four of every five returns are qualifying for refunds 
slightly above last years figure refunds are averaging more than 
850 
if irs estimates of how long it takes to prepare a return are 
correct procrastinators should not wait too late monday before 
beginning the task the agency guesses the average person requires 
2 hours and 32 minutes to learn about the law and form 1040 
another 3 hours 10 minutes to fill it out and 35 minutes to copy 
assemble and mail it 
that adds up to 6 hours and 17 minutes not counting the 3 
hours and 7 minutes of recordkeeping required and that total does 
not include the time required to do a schedule a for itemized 
deductions 1 hour and 47 minutes plus recordkeeping a schedule b 
for interest and dividends 44 minutes or any other supplemental 
form 
while the conservative tax foundation was highlighting the 
overall growth of taxes the democratic study group was marking the 
filing deadline by decrying a shift of tax burden away from the 
rich 
the organization which includes most liberal democrats in the 
house released an analysis indicating that since 1980 the total 
federal tax burden for the threefifths of the population with low 
to middle incomes rose the next highest 20 percent realized a net 
cut of only about 45 and the 1 percent of households with the 
very highest incomes had taxes cut by an average of more than 
12000

aids can still be a dirty word out in the 
country and sufferers in rural areas often live miles from medical 
care and face even greater obstacles just to live out their lives 
health officials and activists say 
theres a big stigma about being gay or being a drug user 
or being hiv positive said dr ted holloway who heads a 
16county health district in southeast georgia 
holloway meets monday with the national commission on aids 
which is traveling to rural georgia to study the effects aids 
outside the big cities where aids patients and their treatment 
programs are most concentrated 
weve had people lose their jobs and get kicked out of their 
apartments holloway said theres a lot of selfblame people 
become totally dependent on their families living in fear about 
how people will react to their disease 
some patients holloway said are afraid to tell their insurance 
companies instead they try to pay for expensive tests and drugs 
out of their own pockets 
a spokesman for rainbow partners a yearold support group here 
said a friend spent 10000 in four years for treatment in 
jacksonville fla until he became so sick he had to tell his 
employer and file insurance claims 
his employer turned out to be very supportive said the 
spokesman who would identify himself only as charles 
he said rural residents tend to think of aids as a bigcity 
problem they see it on tv and say we dont have that here 
he said once they meet someone who had aids it becomes 
personalized and changes their attitudes 
support programs also exist in brunswick valdosta and albany 
where ramona price the states aids program manager for 14 
southwest georgia counties and two others run a group called hiv 
positive 
the albany group provides counseling educational programs and 
housing money this month the group will train volunteers for a 
buddy system to help people sickened by the disease 
theres a lot of red tape when it comes to acquiring state 
funds she said if theyre sick and bedridden its a drain on 
the family 
some of georgias big cities have aids treatment centers 
including an advanced clinic at atlantas grady hospital but rural 
patients generally do not have easy access to such care especially 
if they are poor 
dr paul white district health director in southwestern 
georgia which has had 97 reported aids cases in three years said 
indigent patients from albany have to make a monthly 350mile 
round trip to grady for drugs and treatment 
we need clinics and we need money for drugs white said 
holloway said there are an estimated 60000 people who are hiv 
positive in georgia and 60 percent or 36000 need the drug azt 
this year the state has federal funds to treat only 150 patients 
with azt he said 
of 3488 aids cases reported in georgia since january 1987 the 
eightcounty 2736600population atlanta area had 2549 
holloways district which includes the city of savannah has a 
population of 275000 was second with 237 cases proportionately 
the incidence of aids is about the same in the two regions 
we dont have large gay communities like the big cities 
holloway said its been hard to mobilize community activities 
because we dont have that leadership from the gay community 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving sufferers prey to various infections and cancers 
the aids virus also known as human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
according to a january 1990 study by the state the increase in 
the spread of aids in rural georgia is due mainly to drug use and 
heterosexual transmission from male drug users to their female 
partners 
georgias problem could be getting worse health officials fear 
that georgias syphilis epidemic linked to the practice of 
trading sex for crack cocaine portends a surge in aids cases in 
years to come 
in southeastern georgia syphilis jumped from 48 cases in 1984 
to 500 last year weve talked to hivpositive crack addicts who 
are having sex with 30 or 40 people a month holloway said 
theres just got to be transmission occurring 
the aids commission will visit waycross and albany on monday to 
meet with aids patients their families doctors and health 
officials on tuesday they meet with health officials and aids 
patients at a clinic in macon 
the 15member panel created by congress in 1988 submitted its 
first report to the white house in december calling for urgent 
action to repair the nations health care system to make it more 
responsive to aids

washington resistance from airlines airports and foreign 
governments is hindering federal efforts to install sophisticated 
bomb detectors at highrisk airports 
the machines which scan luggage with neutrons are very costly 
bulky and not foolproof critics say they cant be used on 
passengers and in the two airports where theyre installed they 
are inspecting only a fraction of the total luggage load 
but proponents say the devices should be used until better 
antiterrorist technology comes along they cite sobering 
statistics to make their point three bombs planted aboard 
passenger jets killed 548 people during the past 16 months and 
bombs were found or threats made affecting several other flights 
james busey head of the federal aviation administration has 
ordered us airlines to buy and install at airports scores of the 
nearly 1 million thermoneutron analysis tna units or any other 
machine that can meet its specifications 
france japan and possibly other countries are developing 
competing systems faa officials say and a massachusetts company 
has placed portable units using other technologies at some 
embassies and foreign airports but only for handcarried items and 
passengers 
plastic explosives that can be molded into virtually any shape 
and elude detection in hand or ordinary xray searches have 
replaced hijacking as the major threat to world aviation 
the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 which killed all 
259 people aboard and 11 more on the ground at lockerbie scotland 
was caused by plastic explosives concealed in a radiocassette 
recorder 
an explosion destroyed a french uta jetliner over the niger 
desert last september killing 171 people and another bomb aboard 
a colombia jetliner in november over a bogota suburb took the lives 
of all 107 people aboard 
a bomb was found and defused aboard a saudi jumbo jet in 
november and several bomb threats have been made against other 
airliners including a northwest flight from paris to detroit in 
december 
despite these incidents the tna devices are in use at only two 
of the 40 world airports the faa considers most likely to be used 
by terrorists miami has one as does new yorks john f kennedy 
airport but at jfk fewer than 500 of the estimated 75000 daily 
pieces of luggage are inspected by the tna machine 
the tnas are built by science applications international corp 
of san diego the machines which are radioactive and cannot be 
used to scan passengers put out a neutron cloud that penetrates 
and interacts with elements of explosives enabling the machine to 
identify them 
hadi bozorgmanesh saic vice president said the jfk unit has 
had a false alarm rate of 25 percent he said since september 
only about 40 bags have had to be handsearched 
no bombs have been known to slip through and none have been 
found he said except in test bags that are sent through regularly 
to keep a constant check on the units reliability 
the faa has purchased six tna units which it eventually will 
turn over to airlines or airports and is expected soon to issue 
deadlines for airlines to buy their own the third faa unit is to 
be installed in london next month 
but the agency is having difficulty placing the remaining three 
airlines think the government since it is most often the 
target should pay for all of the detectors airports say they 
dont have space for the 10ton tna units which are about the size 
of a small bedroom some foreign governments dont trust them 
busey said the installed units are meeting expectations but he 
told the presidential aviation security and terrorism commission 
earlier this month that he will review his directives partly 
because effectiveness of the machines may be compromised by all the 
publicity they have generated 
faa officials said last week however that busey is not likely 
to retreat from the orders requiring airlines to purchase the units 
we cannot wait until the perfect system comes along busey 
has told critics 
aviation industry officials say the faa requirements are 
premature 
the faa has yet to show that the machine will fit into airline 
and airport operations said tim neale spokesman for the 
industrys air transport association 
neale said us airlines fear checkin delays caused by the 
machines may steer international business travelers to foreign 
carriers 
northwest airlines turned down a unit at detroit citing 
electrical and space problems the detroit news in an editorial 
said northwests rejection was based on thin excuses 
the san francisco airport which uses dogs to search for bombs 
objected to the tna machine being assigned to a single airline 
said spokesman ron wilson 
one airline could claim it had the safest service we didnt 
think that was fair said wilson 
german officials balked over reliability of the devices and now 
have an agreement to test the jfk unit in may or june negotiations 
are under way to place one at manila where northwest suggested the 
detroitbound unit be diverted 
the sevenmember presidential commission itself is raising 
questions about the faa orders formed in response to the flight 
103 bombing the panel is expected to be critical of some 
government antiterrorism efforts in its report due may 15 
commission chairwoman ann mclaughlin told busey she is concerned 
that the faas sweeping orders requiring the devices might have had 
a dampening effect on the development of improved technologies 
there has got to be a better mousetrap out there she said 
a nonradioactive portable egis detector developed by 
thermedics of woburn mass checks passengers and handcarried 
luggage the scanners sometimes called sniffers are used by 
the state department at foreign embassies and by some foreign 
airports 
costing about oneseventh as much as the tna units the egis is 
so sensitive it can detect minute amounts of plastic explosives 
said thermedics president john wood but it has not been developed 
for checkedin baggage and does not meet faa specifications

poor josef stalin 
the once allpowerful dictator sculpted on the facade of the 
institute of party history here has white paint resembling runny 
marshmallow dribbling from his walrus moustache down the front of 
his coat 
a few feet away on the same building martyred revolutionaries 
who fought for soviet rule in the caucasus region have lost their 
faces to vandals chisels 
just down rustaveli boulevard the main drag in tbilisi a 
statue of soviet founder vladimir lenin is still standing but 
just barely georgian communist party chief givi gumbaridze and 
some comrades blocked a recent attempt by hooligans to drag it off 
it is reputedly the last lenin statue left on its feet in this 
southwestern republic of 5 million people 
since soviet troops sent in with politburo approval killed 19 
protesters in tbilisi one year ago its been hard to be a 
communist in georgia 
vazha gurgenidze ideology secretary of the georgian communist 
party said that for days after last years april 9 clash i 
couldnt look my children in the eyes 
although he helped evacuate the wounded from the square the 
attack can morally be pinned on the communist party and it will 
always be with us he said in his office in the imposing 
goldenmarbled central committee building 
gurgenidze denied that georgias communist party is under siege 
saying its membership of 400000 has even risen slightly but after 
the clash and the resulting furor we felt immediately that we 
couldnt go on as we had been we had to go with the people he 
said 
the party supports calls for eventual georgian independence 
party officials even laid wreaths at the graves of the victims 
before anniversary protests last week 
but georgias many independence activists say the communist 
party is a thing of the past and is a passive caretaker until 
elections this fall 
even the official soviet news agency tass commented on a 
certain vacuum of power in the caucasus republic 
unlike in the baltic republics where wellorganized popular 
movements have stepped in to replace discredited communists the 
georgian political scene is a hodgepodge of splinter parties 
in the past year and particularly since the georgian supreme 
soviet legalized a multiparty system last month about 120 parties 
have sprouted by gurgenidzes count 
the opposition parties are split into two camps one is a 
coalition called the national forum that advocates mass civil 
disobedience the other envisions a parliamentary struggle for 
independence like those in the baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia 
among the most prominent is the georgian popular front whose 
leader nodar natadze is trying to persuade radicals that they 
should run for the republics parliament 
zviad gamsakhurdia a former political prisoner now considered 
the dean of georgias dissidents said he believes georgia will be 
the fourth of the 15 soviet republics to secede as soon as the 
baltic states have independence georgia will too he said 
lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence encourages 
us it gives us force and it gives us hope he added 
but activists also acknowledge that georgia faces some special 
obstacles 
the republic includes three autonomous regions abkhazia 
adzharia and southern ossetia and disputes over their status have 
led to several violent ethnic clashes in the last year in the 
bloodiest more than 20 people died in fighting between georgians 
and abkhazians last summer 
according to the law on secession passed this month such 
autonomous regions have enormous say on whether and on what terms 
a republic can leave the soviet union 
its a horrible law popular front leader natadze fumed in 
an interview 
also georgia unlike the baltic republics does not have 
widespread international recognition that it was forcibly annexed 
although it is acknowledged that it joined the soviet union in 1921 
while occupied by the red army 
but what georgians do have is a donttreadonme attitude 
a few blocks down rustaveli boulevard from the institute of 
party history a dozen blackgarbed women outside the citys main 
art museum are holding a vigil that has lasted more than 150 days 
their signs proclaim they are demanding punishment for the 
officials that ordered the charge that killed their children and 
for the soldiers who did the killing last april 9 
asked if they wouldnt eventually just give up a local activist 
said never theyre georgians

a wayward nut from a candy bar may 
someday bear fruit for lorene arnold 
the almond tree in her back yard apparently began as a nut in 
her grandsons candy bar she said 
she recalled that she first noticed a weed growing in a planter 
by the front door about five years ago when she pulled it she 
discovered an almondlike seed attached to the roots 
it kind of shocked me she said i poked my finger down in 
the hole and replanted it to see what it would do 
she said their grandson rocky arnold then 9 heard his 
grandparents discussing the weed and confessed 
the seed came from a candy bar he said adding grandma i 
throwed that in there because i dont like the nuts 
leave it to grandkids mrs arnold said 
i wouldnt have thought it would sprout after all the 
processing she said 
mrs arnold let the tree grow in the planter for a while but 
eventually moved it to the back yard where it has thrived and is 
now taller than she is

a deteriorated revolver has been unearthed 
by construction crews tearing up the main street through cheyennes 
historic downtown raising hopes that a bit of the wild west has 
turned up 
experts at the state museum refuse to speculate the exact age of 
the corroded pistol until a study is completed but judging from 
the location in which it was found it could be more than a century 
old 
i wouldnt want to imagine for a minute that it was the result 
of an old gunfight on main street but all things are possible 
said steve cotherman manager of the wyoming state museum 
the revolver was uncovered friday at a level lower than buried 
streetcar tracks which were built in the 1890s normally an 
object found on a lower level is older cotherman said 
the gun whose wooden grip is all but disintegrated and the 
trigger barely discernible appears to be a 38caliber or larger 
he said 
it is probably a military revolver because it has a lanyard 
ring which was used by officers to attach a fancy string or chain 
for military dress purposes he said 
while it might be fun to fantasize about the guns history 
cotherman said we never speculate on stuff like that we try not 
to perpetuate old legends and myths the facts are usually not as 
romantic

the government will sponsor a threeyear 29 
million research project aimed at reducing or preventing physical 
frailty in the elderly two federal agencies announced sunday 
the national institute on aging and the national center for 
nursing research said sites in eight states will be used for the 
ficsit project short for frailty and injuries cooperative 
studies of intervention techniques 
more than 1500 volunteers will participate in the program to 
include exercise ranging from the oriental practice of tai chi to 
aerobic dance education to make older people aware of accident 
risks and rehabilitation to improve physical conditioning 
millions of older people are frail lacking strength mobility 
balance and endurance which can make them susceptible to serious 
falls nursing home admissions and a loss of independence 
according to the nia 
the new trials highlight the fact that frailty and injuries 
are not the inevitable outcome of aging said nia director dr t 
franklin williams instead they are problems for which we have 
now found some very viable solutions 
among people over age 75 more than 32 percent are unable to 
climb stairs 40 percent are unable to walk two blocks 7 percent 
cannot walk across a small room and 22 percent cannot lift 10 
pounds the nia said fortytwo percent of nursing home residents 
cannot get out of a chair without help 
dr ada sue hinshaw director of the national center for nursing 
research said the project may help identify frail people who have 
treatable or preventable disabilities 
the eight research teams selected for project are 
david m buchner university of washington seattle maria a 
fiatarone hebrew rehabilitation center for aged boston mark c 
hornbrook kaiser foundation hospitals portland ore meridean

armenians assaulted local kgb headquarters with 
stones torches and flare guns in an attack that the agencys chief 
branded an onslaught by bandits tass said sunday one attacker 
was reported killed 
saturday evenings assault on kgb headquarters in the armenian 
capital of yerevan spurred on by provocative calls to liquidate 
the kgb lasted two hours but the rioters did not manage to 
break into the building the official soviet news agency said 
tass said the crowd had been angered by the kgbs arrest of four 
armenians on charges of stealing weapons from a military unit 
soviet kgb head vladimir a kryuchkov denounced the incident as 
unprecedented in a civilized society 
a group composed mainly of young men broke off from a yerevan 
ecological protest went to the kgb building and started to pelt 
its windows with rocks and lit torches tass reported it said 
flare guns were also used 
one young man whose homemade explosive device went off in his 
own hands was fatally wounded it said 
the news agency did not say how many people were involved in the 
attack 
alexan akopyan spokesman for the armenian national movement 
confirmed the account of the attack in a telephone interview from 
yerevan he said the arrests had been part of an allout campaign 
against armed banditry run by the armenian kgb more to gain 
approval from moscow than to cut the crime rate 
since armenias strained relations with neighboring azerbaijan 
worsened this winter and armed clashes became common armenian 
militants have staged dozens of raids on the republics arms depots 
to get weapons for fighting the azerbaijanis 
the armenian kgb issued a public appeal warning of the special 
danger of the provocative actions of the criminal world 
kryuchkov in a message to the agencys armenian branch praised 
the men inside the building who held themselves ready to repel an 
attack but did not strike back 
only thanks to their restraint and capable actions was it 
possible to avoid more serious consequences and victims his 
message said according to tass 
riots and attacks against kgb government and party buildings 
have become part of a recurring pattern of antisoviet riots in 
various republics in the southern soviet union some of the attacks 
have been clearly aimed at taking arms from police and kgb stocks 
and others have been intended to force political change 
kryuchkov said criminal charges would be brought against the 
rioters and those guilty would be punished with the full 
strictness of the law

france marked the 10th anniversary of jeanpaul 
sartres death sunday with a mixture of praise and suggestions from 
intellectuals that many of his leftist political ideas would be out 
of place in todays world 
in commemorative newspaper and magazine articles this week 
sartre was saluted as one of frances outstanding philosophers and 
writers 
yet the praise generally was mixed with comments that sartres 
leftist sympathies and belief that marxism could be molded into a 
viable ideology has been overtaken by recent political events 
if sartre came back he wouldnt find the world had simply 
changed its an entirely different universe he would discover 
without the iron curtain or peoples republics with communism in 
agony wrote liberation the leftist newspaper which sartre 
founded in the early 1970s 
liberations robert maggiori wrote that sartres political work 
has become a mirror reflecting an epoch that doesnt exist any 
more in a language that isnt spoken any more a broken mirror in 
which nothing can be recognized 
sartre who would have been 85 on sunday openly supported the 
communist party through the 1930s he later denounced stalins 
brutal purges and the soviets crushing of the hungarian uprising 
in 1956 but even in subsequent years he balked at renouncing 
communist theory or leftwing terrorists despite his eloquent 
advocacy of individual freedom 
the philosopher of liberty he blindly justified the worst 
despotisms of his century and even affirmed i have fought all my 
life for a society in which i would not want to live wrote 
essayist pascal brickner this week in express magazine 
it is alas the worst of sartre that lives today the 
critical spirit gone astray the habit of taking up a cause 
without considering it brickner wrote he wasted a large part 
of his talent on the esthetics of violence and revolution 
sartre was born in paris on june 21 1905 and was raised by his 
mother alone after his father died when he was a year old 
he taught school studied philosophy began his decadeslong 
romance with the writer simone de beauvoir was drafted into the 
army and was a german prisoner of war in 194041 before being 
freed 
some of his greatest works his plays the flies and no 
exit and his first major treatise on existentialism being and 
nothingness were written in paris during the war brickner 
among others questioned whether perhaps sartre had shirked his 
duty to the antinazi resistance by focusing on his work 
in 1964 sartre was awarded the nobel prize for literature but 
turned it down seeking to show his contempt for an honor he 
considered bourgeois 
four years later he supported french students during 
politically inspired riots and founded a maoistoriented 
publication called the peoples cause in 1974 he went to 
germany to visit members of the baadermeinhof terrorist group and 
described their actions as necessary to achieve a new 
organization of the masses 
but in 1975 sartre was virtually out of public view sick and 
going blind although he made a dramatic visit to israel in 1976 
he accepted an honorary degree from hebrew university and declared 
that his support for palestinian guerrilla attacks did not mean he 
opposed israel

in an easter sunday salute to mans yearning 
for freedom pope john paul ii said he hoped lithuanians would 
achieve their goal of independence through respectful and 
comprehensive dialogue with moscow 
in other easter celebrations romanians and east germans gave 
thanks for the freedoms won by their prodemocracy revolutions and 
religious leaders called for peace and tolerance in lebanon and 
israel 
in the soviet ukraine where roman catholicism was banned 44 
years ago catholics in kiev were allowed to legally perform easter 
services for the first time in decades 
the pontiff spoke as lithuanians waited to see whether soviet 
president mikihail s gorbachev would carry out his threat to 
impose economic sanctions on the republic unless it rescinded 
independenceoriented actions by sunday 
in the name of jesus dead and risen for all men we ask for 
peace for our children in the dear lithuania nation while we hope 
that their aspirations find confirmation in a respectful and 
comprehensive dialogue the pope said 
he spoke in lithuanian after delivering his noontime easter 
message from the central balcony overlooking st peters square 
cheers went up from a crowd of 100000 faithful and tourists in 
the square where the pope earlier celebrated easter mass in front 
of st peters basilica in his speech the pope declared man of 
our time only the risen christ can fully satisfy your 
irrepressible yearning for freedom 
he said mans true dimensions of the spirit have been 
discovered anew after two bloody world wars and years of 
dictatorships which have deprived men and women of their basic 
freedoms 
his message on lithuania was the latest attempt by the vatican 
to help ease tensions between moscow and the tiny baltic republic 
which declared independence on march 11 
tass the soviet news agency reported that a soviet envoy 
received by the pope on saturday had delivered a message from 
gorbachev about the crisis in lithuania where four out of five 
people are catholic 
the vatican in march opened diplomatic relations with moscow 
earlier this month the vaticans newly appointed envoy to the 
soviet union said the holy see would be willing to mediate the 
lithuanian dispute 
in his speech john paul gave holiday wishes in 55 languages 
the longest greetings went to lithuania and his homeland poland 
quoting from the gospel of john the pope told his 
economicallydepressed homeland you have the tribulations of the 
world but have faith 
in romania tens of thousands of worshipers sang ancient hymns 
in packed churches across the nation in an emotional celebration of 
their first free easter in more than four decades 
in timisoara where romanias prodemocracy revolution started 
and where some of the worst fighting occurred archbishop nicolae 
eulogized the martyrs of the revolution in a sermon to 2000 people 
after 45 years during which communists tried to enslave our 
soul and history we now celebrate in freedom holy easter he 
said 
so far when we said christ has risen we thought that one 
day better would come and now it did come due to those who 
sacrificed their lives he said 
similar services were held in the two germanys 
east and west germans poured through their border in both 
directions and packed churches to give thanks for their newfound 
freedoms while thousands of others took part in traditional peace 
protests 
border guards waved crowds from west berlin through the 
brandenburg gate checkpoint where churchgoers headed for roman 
catholic services at st hedwigs cathedral and lutheran services 
at st marys church in east berlin 
before east germanys prodemocracy revolution last year its 
citizens could only dream of visiting friends and relatives in the 
west independent church leaders were officially scorned 
in lebanon church bells vied with bursts of gunfire in east 
beirut as thousands of christians celebrated easter and wondered 
whether fullscale fighting would break out again in the battle for 
control of their enclave 
police said troops of renegade gen michel aoun and lebanese 
forces militiamen of christian warlord samir geagea clashed 
intermittently 
the firing drowned out church bells ringing in neighboring 
districts and many people were too frightened to venture out for 
easter mass 
in israel the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem used his 
easter message to call for equality between peoples as tension 
continued between jews and christian arabs over a jewish settlement 
in the citys christian quarter 
in a sermon before hundreds of pilgrims and tourists at the 
church of the holy sepulchre the traditional site of christs 
crucifixion and burial patriarch michel sabbah said 
individuals and peoples are equal in all rights a people must 
not oppress another people nor must a people be dominated by 
another people 
a few hundred yards away paramilitary border police guarded a 
building in the christian section of jerusalems old city occupied 
wednesday by a group of 150 jewish nationalists the occupation 
sparked rioting by christian arabs 
the jerusalem district court has ordered the settlers out of the 
building but they are appealing the decision 
as ukrainian catholics held easter services in kiev a 
controversial cathedral in the western ukrainian city of lvov that 
was given back last week to ukrainian catholics was closed for 
easter to avoid conflict 
an announcement by the ukrainian popular movement rukh said st 
georges cathedral which had been under russian orthodox control 
was closed to prevent provocations and ease tension during the 
holiday 
the ukrainian catholic faith was outlawed in 1946 by soviet 
authorities after josef stalin seized control of the western 
ukraine at the end of world war ii but recently under gorbachevs 
reforms it has been practiced openly 
soviet tv devoted more than 15 minutes to easter coverage in the 
soviet union jerusalem and bulgaria on sunday night in what soviet 
viewers said was the longest televised easter report they could 
remember

us rep harold ford and his lawyers get 
their turn this week at countering allegations that he took more 
than 12 million in political payoffs from two crooked bankers he 
says his defense likely will be brief 
the government does not have a case the tennessee democrat 
said friday 
ford is charged with conspiracy bank and mail fraud 
since testimony began march 1 witnesses have described a scheme 
in which ford allegedly got loans from banks controlled by ch 
butcher jr and his brother jake a twotime democratic candidate 
for governor 
the butchers are serving 20year prison sentences for bank fraud 
stemming from a 1983 bank failure the largest in the states 
history 
witnesses said few if any payments were ever made on the loans 
which were rolled over into new loans when the notes came due 
the government says ford and his family got more than 12 
million in exchange for unspecified political favors ford says the 
loans were for 650000 and it was repaid 
ford said his attorney had prepared to call 41 witnesses but 
now may call only the congressman 
it is narrowed down to whether we should close it out on the 
bang of harold ford taking the stand or whether that is needed 
he said 
prosecutors on wednesday surprised defense lawyers by resting 
their case without bringing to the stand ch butcher jr who has 
pleaded guilty to two counts of the 19count indictment 
fords lawyers are to inform us district judge odell horton on 
monday how they plan to proceed ford said his lawyers will ask for 
a directed verdict of acquittal from the judge but have little 
hopes of getting it 
the jury is scheduled to return tuesday 
ford is on trial with three former butcher aides accountant 
david crabtree and lawyers karl schledwitz and douglas beaty 
the four can put on independent defenses but ford said lawyers 
for his codefendants are working closely with his attorneys 
assistant us attorney dan clancy the lead prosecutor 
declined to comment on the governments decision not to call 
butcher as a witness clancy noted however that butcher still can 
be called as a rebuttal witness 
ford the only black member of tennessees congressional 
delegation has blamed his legal troubles on racists and on a 
personal vendetta directed by clancy a republican appointee 
clancy has denied that allegation 
first elected to congress in 1974 ford has had little 
opposition for reelection and he is credited with running a 
political organization that can deliver the black vote in his 
hometown memphis the states largest city 
government witnesses said ford started getting loans from the 
butchers in 1976 but made few if any payments on them until after 
the brothers banking empire fell 
ford generally got the loans without collateral and with little 
or no explanation on how he would repay them government witnesses 
said 
jesse barr a former top aide to jake butcher testified that 
ford was not expected to repay his loans barr is serving an 
18yearprison sentence for misapplying bank funds

twenty blacks were reported 
killed as factional fighting raged throughout natal province 
despite stepped up security measures in the region police said 
sunday 
also state radio said a mixedrace soldier was killed sunday 
morning when his vehicle was ambushed during a patrol in black 
township of mpumulanga in natal 
the 20 deaths listed on the police unrest report represented one 
of the highest singleday casualty figures since rival black groups 
began battling for supremacy in the southeastern province in 1986 
the unrest report released each morning covers incidents from the 
previous 24 hours 
about 4000 blacks have died in the past four years including 
hundreds in fighting that has escalated sharply since february 
in the worst single attack police said 10 men were killed and 
two wounded in a factional fight at ngubela about 80 miles 
southwest of the port city of durban 
five men died when fighting erupted over an apparent land 
dispute at ngilayeni also in natal police said 
the burned bodies of three women and a man were found at three 
different locations in natal the unrest report said police also 
found the body of a man who had been shot in mpumulanga one of the 
most violent areas during recent years 
the main combatants in natal are supporters of the african 
national congress a black nationalist movement and inkatha a 
relatively conservative zulu organization 
neutral observers blame both sides for the fighting the anc and 
inkatha both have large numbers of young supporters they cannot 
control 
anc deputy president nelson mandela and mangosuthu buthelezi 
head of inkatha and leader of the zulu homeland have both made 
repeated pleas for peace that have been ignored 
president fw de klerk announced plans april 2 to crack down on 
the fighting he says the violence in natal and elsewhere is 
threatening his plans to start negotiations on a new constitution 
that will increase the role in government affairs of the countrys 
28 million black majority 
the government has sent additional police and soldiers to natal 
including an army battalion made up of portuguesespeaking black 
angolans that battalion was one of south africas leading combat 
units when the country was involved in wars in angola and namibia 
in recent years 
antiapartheid groups have long opposed the presence of soldiers 
in the black townships 
but natal residents and antiapartheid figures including 
mandela generally have supported the recent addition of troops 
because the fighting has become so intense mandela has said the 
army is preferable to the police which the anc has accused of 
being biased in favor of inkatha 
however walter sisulu an anc leader said sunday the 
government should not station the battalion of black angolans in 
natal 
we are sure that their presence will aggravate the situation 
instead of bringing peace said sisulu head of the ancs 
internal wing most of the anc leadership remains in exile 
the south african defense force said the battalion was chosen 
because its members are neutral and do not have affiliations 
which could be seen to side with factions involved in the unrest in 
natal 
both the anc and inkatha oppose apartheid but differ over 
tactics the anc has waged a guerrilla campaign though it is 
largely dormant now the organization favors sanctions boycotts 
strikes and other confrontational methods to pressure the whiteled 
government 
inkatha does not endorse any of these measures and buthelezi is 
a proponent of capitalism in contrast to the socialistleaning anc

chinatown normally jammed with tourists 
has been suffering financially since octobers earthquake smashed 
one of the main highways leading to the maze of crowded streets and 
bustling shops 
so when mayor art agnos suggested the crippled embarcadero 
freeway be destroyed instead of repaired with a new road built at 
ground level or underground merchants decided they had had enough 
activist rose pak of the chinese chamber of commerce is leading 
the fight to rebuild the 17mile freeway at her urging hundreds 
of chinatown merchants planned to lock their doors monday and show 
up at a board of supervisors meeting where the freeways fate was 
expected to be decided 
agnos argues the freeway is ugly it blocks prime views of san 
francisco bay and too expensive to repair and reopen 
his supporters on the issue include many groups who oppposed it 
even before it opened in 1959 they include preservationists and 
urban design activists who say the freeway sacrifices city streets 
and alters the character of neighborhoods 
the freeway survived a 1986 vote to spend 10 million to tear it 
down 
but opponents of the mayors plan say rebuilding the damaged 
highway would take far less time than building a new underground 
stretch and time is the key to recovery of businesses in the 
nations secondlargest chinatown 
pak called the plan to shut down the neighborhoods shops and 
cafes for a show of force as the supervisors vote on the agnos 
proposal a very basic grass roots humble gesture 
a longtime ally of agnos the outspoken pak is steamed that the 
mayor has rejected the message of 10000 people who signed 
prorepair petitions 
its a political statement that were not a silent minority 
she said 
signs supporting the shutdown are posted in store windows 
throughout chinatown 
under agnos proposal 120 million would be spent to replace 
the elevated roadway with a sunken one leading into chinatown 
north beach fishermans wharf and the rest of the waterfront he 
acknowledges it could take five or six years to complete 
it would cost far less an estimated 32 million to reinforce 
and patch up the freeway the state transportation department has 
that amount set aside for the repair and is awaiting the city 
decision of whether work can begin 
one supervisor the protesters have on their side at mondays 
meeting will be tom hsieh who says hes outraged by the mayors 
decision 
it was explained to the board of supervisors in a twopage 
release devoid of details such as where the 120 million would come 
from and what chinatown is supposed to do while the underground 
expressway is built he said 
some leaders have no idea of the hardship and the trauma 
people in that community are facing hsieh said they lost not 
just business they lost employment 
residents and businessmen in chinatown just went wild when 
they heard the mayors plan he said theyre simply panicked 
they have no confidence in the city government that it can take 
care of their daily life 
at the golden gate restaurant association executive director 
cecilia metz said no vote of the organizations members has been 
taken on the freeway controversy but the sentiment is clear 
no one can wait five or six years she said 
joining opposition to the freeway demolition has been the san 
francisco chamber of commerce business panel which voted last week 
to support rebuilding the damaged road 
harold lee executive director of asian inc a nonprofit small 
business advocacy group said agnos plan will cost him not just in 
chinatown but with people who own businesses or work in nearby 
less vocal areas as well 
of course it will hurt agnos politically he said people 
are not stupid 
but agnos insists hes pursuing the best longterm interests of 
the city rather than shortterm needs of any one community 
nobody wants to sacrifice shortterm discomfort for longterm 
progress but thats what a great city has to do or it will become 
stagnant he said

birthday of president kim il sung official news reports said 
at may day stadium in pyongyang communist north koreas 
capital 150000 people listened to speeches glorifying kim by vice 
president li jong ok and other officials the norths korean 
central news agency reported 
kim and his son and heir apparent kim jong il were not listed 
among those attending the rally 
some recent news reports from beijing have quoted east european 
diplomats there as saying the aging communist ruler may turn over 
some of his official posts to his son soon after his birthday 
but there was no indication of such a shift in the official 
north korean reports monitored in tokyo 
kim has led the secretive nation since its formation after the 
division of the korean peninsula at the end of world war ii and he 
has created a huge personality cult 
in a birthday editorial sunday the communist party newspaper 
rodong sinmun said that through kims guidance our nation which 
was weak and backward in the past has been able to grow into a 
mighty and independent nation 
south koreas yonhap news agency reported last week that north 
korea had invited about 100 arts ensembles from 60 countries to 
celebrate kims birthday designated a national holiday

senate leaders in both parties warned soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev on sunday that carrying out his 
threatened economic blockade against lithuania could derail opening 
trade relations between the united states and moscow 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and minority 
leader bob dole rkan said retaliation by moscow to lithuanias 
march 11 declaration of independence would jeopardize a trade 
agreement president bush and gorbachev hoped to sign at a summit in 
june 
the bush administration meanwhile was taking what secretary of 
state james a baker iii described as a wait and see attitude 
as the kremlinimposed deadline for lithuania to rescind its 
declaration of independence passed sunday night 
mitchell who on saturday condemned gorbachevs ultimatum as 
precisely the wrong approach said sunday he was waiting for 
bush to do the same but in an interview on cbstvs face the 
nation he also supported the administrations reluctance to 
issue specific counter threats 
we ought not to be announcing in advance what were going to 
do when we dont know for sure that they are going to do he 
said he has made a threat he has not yet carried it out we 
dont know what theyre going to do 
however mitchell said a wide range of possible reactions 
could include canceling the summit slowing down the trade 
negotiations and in between those a whole lot of things that 
can be done 
dole interviewed on nbcs meet the press from jerusalem 
questioned the wisdom of canceling the summit if the soviets carry 
out their threat to cut off supplies to lithuania 
on areas where we mutually benefit arms control maybe those 
should proceed on target he said it would probably be a 
little strained summit if in fact this continues but i look at 
the arms control issues as being mutually beneficial to the united 
states and to the soviet union 
any us retaliation dole said should be limited to measures 
such as a trade accord that are more to moscows benefit than to 
the united states 
mitchell said he and five other senators just back from the 
soviet union after meeting with gorbachev and two lithuanian 
delegations last week planned to meet with bush in the next few 
days to give him their impressions 
i think there is room for movement on both sides some 
possibility of bridging the gap between them mitchell said

preferences of the missing 24 percent but indicated about 10 
percent of those polled supported the bulgarian national agrarian 
union another opposition group

the last month but a gain of 7 percent over the same period by the 
union of democratic forces the press agency reported without 
elaborating

sen spark m matsunaga of hawaii a longtime 
advocate for peace and champion of japaneseamericans seeking 
compensation for their internment during world war ii died early 
sunday in toronto he was 73 
the late democrats spokesman ed greaney said in washington 
that matsunaga died about 2 am he was in toronto for cancer 
treatment 
greaney said the senators body would be flown to washington on 
a military aircraft sunday and to hawaii early this week 
the spokesman said hawaii gov john waihee asked that the body 
lie in state wednesday in the state capitol burial would be 
thursday or friday at national memorial cemetery of the pacific at 
punchbowl 
matsunaga who announced in january that he was suffering from 
prostate cancer that had spread to the bone died at toronto 
general hospital according to nursing coordinator olga muir the 
senator traveled to canada last week for treatment at an oncology 
clinic according to greaney 
the senators wife helene daughter merle and son keene 
were with him when he died greaney said 
the senator has been plagued by medical ailments including a 
heart attack in 1984 a stomach ulcer in 1987 a serious bout with 
the flu and back problems in 1988 
waihee a democrat has authority to name a successor to serve 
until a special election could be held in november matsunagas 
term runs through 1994 
rep daniel k akaka a hawaii democrat elected to the house in 
1976 is considered the leading choice to succeed matsunaga 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii said it is not impossible to fill 
anothers shoes in a particular job but i dont think its 
possible to find someone with sparkys touch 
he said akaka would seem to be the logical choice to succeed 
matsunaga 
akaka refused to discuss the possibility of his appointment 
saying at this time my deep concern is for his family and also 
in participating to create a most adequate and proper tribute for 
this great american 
sparkys death is an enormous loss for the united states and 
people of hawaii he was a great american a peacemaker he was 
distinguished militarily politically socially and globally ill 
remember sparky as having a human local hawaiian touch when it 
came to politics 
carolyn tanaka press secretary to waihee said it would be 
several days before the governor began to deal with the issue of a 
successor 
when i learned of sparks passing said inouye i recalled 
a conversation i had with him about three years ago i asked how he 
would like to be remembered and he said id like to be 
remembered as a friend a friend of the war veterans as a 
friend of the forgotten those who have no friends as one who 
supports those who are peacemakers as your friend i said 
im certain youll be remembered as a friend of hawaii 
matsunaga was known more for his easygoing manner and his warm 
treatment of constituents than his impact on legislation but when 
he cared deeply about an issue he combined skill and perseverance 
to win passage 
in 1988 he engineered passage of a 125 billion law that pays 
20000 to each surviving japaneseamerican interned in a us 
prison camp during world war ii 
matsunaga a japaneseamerican who was highly decorated in world 
war ii had to overcome opposition to the internment law from some 
veterans and from those who objected to its cost during debate 
the senator was forced to halt his comments in midsentence while 
telling of an elderly internee killed by a guard as he went to pick 
up a softball 
i myself become overly emotional when i think about it even to 
this day he said after regaining his composure 
matsunaga lobbied for 22 years before persuading congress in 
1984 to establish a us peace institute peacemaking is as much 
an art to be learned as war was his persistent argument 
matsunaga supported a joint ussoviet exploration of mars 
sponsored a plan for an international space year in 1992 and worked 
to make his state a center for space exploration 
waihee said sunday he will be remembered most for his vision 
of peace and his faith in the human heart in his memory we will 
carry on his quest in his spirit we will strive for the highest of 
principles and the brightest of worlds 
senator matsunaga has been a steady and guiding force 
throughout hawaiis modern history sparky warmed our state and 
country with his humanitarianism 
matsunaga was first elected to the house in 1962 and the senate 
in 1976 
when he died he was the secondranking democrat on the finance 
committee and chairman of its subcommittee on taxation and debt 
management 
before going to washington matsunaga was a member of hawaiis 
territorial house from 1954 to 1959 
he was born oct 8 1916 on kauai island the son of immigrants 
from japan 
after graduating from the university of hawaii with honors in 
1941 matsunaga joined the 100th infantry battalion which later 
became part of the famed 442nd regimental combat team the go for 
broke 442nd would become the most decorated regiment in us 
history

the judge conducting the inquiry into 
the scandinavian star ferry fire rejected charges sunday that the 
proceedings were being improperly conducted 
authorities said 160 people died in the blaze which police are 
investigating as a case of arson the 20yearold ferry caught fire 
april 7 in swedish waters on an overnight trip from norway to 
denmark 
maritime unions in norway and sweden have criticized the 
hearings now in their fifth day they complained attorneys for the 
shipowners were dominating the questioning of witnesses and the 
captain has been allowed to attend all sessions after testifying as 
the first witness 
the norwegian captain hugo larsen admitted he abandoned the 
burning ship while some passengers remained alive on board 
we are on the borderland of parody when representatives of the 
ferry owners are the ones asking questions during the inquiry 
norwegian sailors union leader gudmund aasheim told the 
norwegian news agency ntb 
but marine and trade court president frank poulsen the judge 
heading the hearing said the proceedings are continuing in a 
correct and harmonious way 
poulsen said the inquiry came at the request of the danish 
shipowner vr dano lines and that the presence of its 
representatives was required by law 
the judge said the purpose of the inquiry was to find the facts 
in the case witnesses are under oath and have been warned that 
their testimony could be used in any subsequent criminal case 
representatives of the ferrys insurers scandinavian marine 
authorities and norwegian and danish police are also taking part in 
the inquiry about half of the expected 30 witnesses have testified 
a commission of danish norwegian and swedish maritime officials 
also is scheduled to hold hearings on the case following the 
copenhagen marine court inquiry

the christian science church says its right to 
exist goes on trial this week with two church members charged with 
manslaughter for relying on prayer alone to heal their 2yearold 
son 
the prosecution will argue that the david and ginger twitchells 
son robyn might be alive today had his parents sought medical 
attention for his bowel obstruction 
the twitchells attorney rikki klieman said she will argue 
that her clients far from acting recklessly sought the only real 
cure that was dictated by their most deeply held beliefs 
the us supreme court typically has refused to hear such cases 
and there has been little consensus in similar cases heard in state 
courts around the country 
a los angeles judge in february acquitted eliot and lise 
glaser a christian scientist couple of involuntary manslaughter 
in the meningitis death of their toddler son on grounds of 
insufficient evidence 
in august 1989 a santa rosa calif jury acquitted christian 
scientists mark rippberger and susan middleton of like charges in 
the meningitis death of their 15monthold daughter but convicted 
them of child endangerment 
in sarasota fla a christian scientist husband and wife 
received probation for their april 1989 conviction for thirddegree 
murder for letting their diabetic 7yearold daughter die without 
receiving medical attention 
on tuesday almost exactly four years after robyn twitchells 
death his parents go on trial in suffolk district court under the 
scrutiny of the mother church world headquarters here of the 
christian science church 
a week before the trial was to begin the church took out 
fullpage ads in several massachusetts newspapers to discuss the 
case and explain church doctrine why the ads ask is prayer 
being prosecuted in boston 
john kiernan a special assistant district attorney denies the 
case is an attack on christian science or a repudiation of 
spiritual healing he said it has nothing to do with freedom of 
religion 
the whole idea is to bring to the front what is the required 
conduct of parents he said we are advocates of children we 
are not persecutors of religious beliefs 
when robyn apparently came down with the flu the twitchells 
followed church teaching and called a christian scientist 
practitioner and christian scientist nurse to treat him said 
church spokesman nathan talbot 
after four days in which the illness ebbed and flowed 
klieman said the boy appeared to get better a day before he died 
she said he went outside to play 
kiernan argued that an adult may choose to forgo conventional 
medical treatment but a child is not in a position to make such a 
decision 
the medical profession is quite clear this condition is 
relatively easy to diagnose and the prescribed treatment has a 
very very high success rate he said 
by relying exclusively on christian science healing the 
twitchells acted with reckless disregard for the health of their 
son he said the state he contends has a duty to protect 
children 
religious practice is subject to regulation by the state 
belief is not theres a whale of a difference particularly 
when dealing with a baby he said 
the church founded in 1879 by mary baker eddy believes that 
physical disease like sin can be healed by spiritual means alone 
there are about 2600 christian science churches in 68 countries 
and the church owns weekly and monthly publications and a 
television news show 
klieman contends prejudice against the christian science church 
lies at the heart of the case this district attorney wants to 
put the christian scientists out of business she said 
oh good lord no kiernan responded reiterating that the 
heart of the issue was parental conduct 
klieman said her clients chose a system of health care 
which they believed was excellent adding that christian science 
practitioners care is covered by blue cross and medicare and is 
tax deductible 
she also has argued that a 1971 amendment to state child abuse 
and neglect law recognizes spiritual healing as an alternative to 
modern medicine but gives christian scientists no guidance on when 
a physician must be called 
harvard divinity professor harvey cox said the case demonstrates 
the difficulty in setting the limits of religious freedom 
theres a feeling within the religious community that the degree 
of state involvement and supervision has gone too far cox said 
yet accommodations have been worked out he said pointing to 
the amish community which repudiates modern practices but 
coexists with a modern state 
perhaps the middle ground in the twitchell case will be carved 
out by a legal recognition of alternative forms of healing he said

saying we are now telling our people and they accept it that 
the next government will be mainly black

groups in addition to the anc the government has said

groups in february as part of his effort to launch blackwhite 
powersharing talks 
the same month he freed black nationalist leader nelson mandela 
from prison mandela deputy president of the anc had been 
imprisoned 27 years he was convicted of sabotage and plotting to

join them together

the steel tubing and had delivered 44 to the ministry of industry 
and minerals in the iraqi capital of baghdad 
iraq has also claimed the metal tubes were pipes for a 
petrochemical plant arms experts have given conflicting opinions 
about whether the steel sections could be used as a weapon 
peck said the company had permission from the department of 
trade and industry to manufacture the tubing and sell it to iraq 
the department refused to comment sunday 
britain banned all arms sales to iraq and iran after the 
outbreak of their eightyear persian gulf war despite the 1988 
ceasefire the embargo remains in effect

between 1980 and 1985 six children were born with downs 
syndrome in this small panhandle area the texas department of 
health and us centers for disease control have said the number is 
significantly more than expected in a population of 25000 the 
agencies found no cause for the birth defects 
more than 250 people from pampa and nearby kingsmill have joined 
a lawsuit against hoechst celanese corp alleging negligence in 
three deaths and numerous injuries from a 1987 explosion at its 
chemical plant 
on friday dr john denko an amarillo pathologist submitted a 
report to state district court in houston in the lawsuit saying 
the number of downs cases probably is related to the 
environmental pollutants from the celanese site 
another pampa area doctor told the court in a letter obtained by 
the pampa news that in 1985 he noted something most unusual in 
the number of downs cases in the area 
dr gerald h holman of the growth and genetics program for 
infants children and adolescents in amarillo said he was concerned 
about alarming levels of environmental pollution and related 
health problems 
vernon hartline an attorney for celanese said the companys 
tests show environmental factors have nothing to do with the downs 
cases 
on friday celanese offered findings by three doctors who said 
it is uncertain whether one of the children discussed by dr 
denko even has downs syndrome 
the socalled general health epidemic is in large part 
merely an amalgamation of a number of health conditions that have 
nothing to do with one another the report said 
it said the incidence of downs cases in pampa are for the 
most part absolutely normal and any increase is due as likely 
as anything else to chance 
the us rate of downs syndrome cases among young women is one 
in 1500 and for women in their late 20s and early 30s about one in 
1000 in the 1980s the number of births among pampa women was 347 
to 484 a year because of the low number of births no more than 
two downs syndrome babies should have been born between 198085 
holman said 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit have asked to be considered a class 
but the court hasnt ruled on the motion

northern threeprovince regions four main nationalist parties 
which hold 53 of 75 seats in the regional parliament 
these are manifestations of a single reality our will to be 
a nation and to decide our fate by ourselves said regional 
parliament leader jose antonio ardanza in san sebastian the 
rallies commemorated aberri eguna which translates from the 
ancient basque language as day of the basque motherland 
more than 10000 people sang the basque national anthem and 
chanted proindependence slogans at a march in pamplona capital of 
the neighboring region of navarre some nationalists want navarre 
to be part of any future basque state 
ardanza addressing a rally in san sebastian attended by 
thousands of members of his basque nationalist party criticized 
his socialist coalition partners for failing to support a 
proindependence proclamation signed feb 15 by the his party and 
three others 
another proclamation in 1987 denounced terrorism the only

the herri batasuna widely considered the political arm of the 
armed separatist group eta eta has claimed responsibility for

22 years 
under spains 1978 constitution the three basque provinces

senate republican leader robert dole said 
sunday that the united states has to take care of its own homeless 
before granting israels request for loans to house soviet jewish 
immigrants 
charity starts at home and that means america dole rkan 
told a news conference we are going to give 400 million to 
israel for housing guarantees when we have 3 million homeless in 
america and no program for them he asked rhetorically 
dole has been the bush administrations point man in attempts to 
reduce foreign aid israel is already the largest recipient of such 
funding getting about 3 billion a year 
the jewish state is seeking the 400 million in usgovernment 
guaranteed housing loans to help absorb the onslaught of soviet 
jewish immigrants israeli officials say as many as 500000 may 
arrive over the next three years 
the prospect of mass immigration has angered the arab world ever 
since israels caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir suggested 
earlier this year that israel needed to retain the occupied lands 
to settle the wave of soviet jews 
president bush made any us aid for immigration purposes 
conditional on an israeli guarantee that the money would not help 
settle soviet jews in territory israel occupied during the 1967 
middle east war including east jerusalem the west bank and gaza 
strip 
bush said in early march that the united states didnt recognize 
israels annexation of the eastern half of jerusalem israel has 
declared unified jerusalem its capital and most palestinians want 
east jerusalem as the capital of an independent palestinian state 
the senate passed a nonbinding resolution march 22 confirming 
that jerusalem should be israels capital dole protested the 
senate decision and said he was going to state his position on the 
senate floor this week 
i conclude the resolution was illtimed he said all it 
does is stir up rhetoric the arab countries only wanted to discuss 
the resolution and not the peace process 
dole claimed that jerusalem mayor teddy kollek had agreed that 
the senate decision came at a bad time and served no useful 
purpose kollek could not immediately be reached for comment 
abraham foxman us director of the bnai briths 
antidefamation league called doles intention to protest the 
senate resolution insulting 
it is inconceivable that he should lead a campaign based on a 
chorus of criticism in the arab world foxman said in a statement 
released in jerusalem sunday 
dole has headed a delegation of five us senators whose visit 
to israel was the last stop on a middle east tour to promote peace 
other countries on the itinerary included egypt syria jordan and 
iraq the group was scheduled to return to washington on sunday 
others in the delegation were james mcclure ridaho alan 
simpson rwyo frank murkowski ralaska and howard metzenbaum 
dohio 
the senators reflecting on israels current political crisis 
stressed that the country urgently needed a government that would 
launch peace talks with the palestinians 
metzenbaum criticized the israeli electoral system that is 
stalling government formation and said he was leaving with no more 
optimism for peace 
metzenbaum saw no readiness for arms control in the middle east 
and said that international supervison over the weapons industry 
was not even discussed with shamir 
however murkowski who earlier celebrated easter sunday in a 
jerusalem church had a more optimistic message 
this is really what easter is all about an opportunity for a 
new beginning he said i think we leave with that challenge 
and communicate that challenge to you

people power scaled the majestic 
himalayas last week and a king bowed to a street revolution 
promising multiparty democracy 
a political stalemate is holding up the reform however and 
some fear nepals movement toward freedom will be turned back 
early monday negotiations between opposition and government 
leaders collapsed and hundreds of angry protesters camped out 
around the site of the talks refusing to let the politicians leave 
on april 8 two days after the bloodiest crackdown in nepals 
modern history 44yearold king birendra gave in to the popular 
revolt declared the press to be free and released political 
prisoners 
tens of thousands of nepalis their faces painted red in 
celebration danced through the streets of the capital shouting 
victory victory 
their tears of joy dried quickly the 17 million people in this 
landlocked nation of breathtaking beauty face serious questions 
how can they establish true democracy in a country where the 
king is allpowerful and viewed by many as a living god what means 
should they use 
the questions are not new 
three decades ago nepal experimented with multiparty politics 
for 18 months the experiment ended abruptly when birendras 
father king mahendra dismissed the government and banned 
political parties which he accused of corruption and incompetence 
now the nepali congress party which mahendra banned has 
returned to haunt his son joining with a leftist coalition the 
party led the movement for democracy that drew hundreds of 
thousands of people into the streets 
doctors pilots government workers students and intellectuals 
conducted strikes the movement peaked april 6 and the goverment 
cracked down up to 200 people were killed when police opened fire 
in katmandu and elsewhere 
two days later a special television broadcast told the story 
the king was establishing a multiparty system in exchange the 
opposition announced an end to its agitation 
new battle lines have been drawn since then 
after the television announcement birendra invited the 
opposition to join an interim government that would prepare for 
elections foreign minister pashupati rana said the kings role 
would be diminished 
opposition parties balked and have threatened to return to the 
streets unless the king dissolves the partyless national assemby 
or rashtriya panchayat and scraps the constitution 
under the system established by his father birendra dominates 
the government he appoints onefifth of the national assembly and 
has a say in the nomination of candidates for the other elected 
seats 
the constitution gives him control of the executive legislative 
and judicial branches of government 
observers say the oppositions first job will be among the most 
difficult to nullify or at least limit the kings power 
we have scored a victory no doubt but we have not staged a 
french revolution said dilli raj regmi cofounder of the nepali 
congress party the scenario has not totally changed and we still 
have limited rights 
he described the monarchy as useless 
the opposition held all the trump cards and should have 
demanded dissolution of the panchayat and the abolition of the 
constitution from the beginning said lok raj baral a professor 
of political science at tribhuvan university the only one in nepal 
unless the opposition acts quickly baral said the result will 
be the same old game of palace intrigue a reference to 
birendras past record of playing one political group against 
another 
krishna prasad bhattarai president of the nepali congress 
party said we have to go stepbystep the agitation was 
stopped to avoid further bloodshed and because we are a 
responsible party he said 
bhattarai added however that if he does not meet our 
demands the king will lose his crown 
he said birendras concession is only the first step toward 
wider democracy that can be achieved only after general elections 
there are no indications when elections will be held 
we are willing to wait one month one year or three years or 
ad infinitum bhattarai said 
others might not share his patience 
nepal with a per capita gross national product of about 160 a 
year is one of worlds poorest countries and 75 percent of the 
people are illiterate 
during the crackdown april 6 tens of thousands of angry men 
threw rocks and sticks at police set fire to government buildings 
and smashed windows throughout the capital 
baral said the people now are ready to assert their rights 
because they have tasted the power of mass movement once the 
peoples movement has started no army or police can stop them

the halls of congress have become one big 
laboratory for a handful of eastern europeans who are spending 
three months learning how democracy works or doesnt work as the 
case may be 
i didnt realize the congress works so slowly to make 
policy said miroslaw luczka a member of the polish senates 
investigations bureau in warsaw 
capitol hill is not as simple as i thought said luczka who 
as an intern with the senate budget committee has been following 
the tortuous legislative course of president bushs request for 
800 million in aid for panama and nicaragua 
they probably wont get that money for months said luczka 
the measure has yet to be approved by the senate 
for the interns most of them poles learning the nuts and 
bolts of congress has been an eyeopening experience 
several of them have had a chance to visit congressional 
districts and attend town meetings and slawomir gorecki 30 had a 
hand in helping to draft legislation that rep david dreier 
rcalif will introduce to encourage investment in eastern europe 
overall they say their stay has been informative useful and 
pleasant with a couple of exceptions 
marian lemke assigned to the offices of rep dennis hastert 
rill and sen bill bradley dnj said he was gunshy about 
the press after a magazine reporter quoted him out of context 
but im willing to try again 
theyve also been surprised by certain things such as the power 
and size of congressional staffs 
i didnt realize capitol hill was such a big machine employing 
44000 said marek krukowski 30 who spent time in the office of 
rep larry craig ridaho 
both krukowski and zdobyslaw milewski a teacher in krakow were 
shocked by the amount of power lawmakers turn over to their staff 
they are so dependent on their staff krukowski said in 
poland politicians rely on their own knowledge 
his colleague said he cant get used to seeing staffers sign a 
boss name to a letter or document 
they also wonder at the hectic life of a member of congress 
milewski 33 has worked in the offices of sen barbara 
mikulski dmd and rep paul kanjorski dpa his assessment 
it might be exciting for a month after that tiring its 
a hard job to be in congress milewski said the philosophy 
instructor is trying to write a article about the average day in 
the life of a lawmaker his conclusion is that their isnt any 
other surprises include 
the close relationship between a lawmaker and his constituents 
luczka said he watched the politician and the people interact at a 
town meeting in bucks county pa when he visited with rep peter 
kostmayer dpa milewski said he was surprised that people call 
their representatives by their first name 
the powerful role of the press the poles say there is too much 
theater and not enough attention to issues with politicians 
playing to the television cameras and courting news coverage the 
other side of the coin is irresponsible reporting they say 
reporters need to be more careful about the facts milewski 
said 
the advances of technology the interns are agog at such 
technological innovations that make it possible to print the entire 
proceedings of congress the next day in the congressional record 
in poland computers copiers and facsimile machines are few and 
far between the interns said 
in fact a 12member delegation headed by the joseph stewart 
the secretary of the senate recently visited poland to assess the 
technical needs of that countrys parliament the plan is for 
congress to come up with equipment for the poles 
catherine messina of the national forum foundation a group that 
raised private money to pay for the east european interns said the 
feedback on the program has been overwhelmingly positive

greta garbo the legendary screen star who 
turned her back on hollywood in 1941 and became as well known for 
her passion for privacy as for her sculpted beauty and husky 
vibrato died sunday she was 84 
new york hospital announces with great sadness the death of 
miss garbo said hospital spokesman andrew banoff 
at the familys request he provided no other information other 
than that she died sunday he declined to say when she entered the 
hospital or at what time she died 
ben buttenweiser a neighbor and friend of miss garbo said the 
actress hadnt been well lately and had had dialysis treatments 
but didnt know the nature of her illness banoff declined to say 
whether miss garbo had been treated for kidney trouble 
the swedishborn star began her career in silent films and 
reigned as the supreme movie queen throughout the 30s some 
critics considered her the finest screen actress of all time 
actor jimmy stewart recalled sunday night that miss garbo had a 
certain mystique about her 
it was a combination of the way she looked her voice and the 
beautiful way she moved stewart said as an actress and as a 
person she had this very special thing about her that i think sort 
of set her apart 
he said he never really got to know miss garbo but was always a 
fan 
i think her mystique was her privacy said comedian milton 
berle she was a wonderful actress and she was very glamorous 
berle said that during his days in vaudeville he wore clothes 
like miss garbos on stage 
after her retirement at age 36 miss garbo never acted again 
but her luminous performances in 24 films kept her name alive and 
made her a favorite of younger generations who saw in her an 
ethereal ideal of the ultimate woman 
while camille and ninotchka became film festival 
staples the woman known worldwide simply as garbo remained 
shuttered in her manhattan apartment or at various retreats in 
france and switzerland 
she suffered little illness through most of her life and was a 
health enthusiast who enjoyed long walks 
carl peterson a doorman and elevator operator at her manhattan 
apartment building said she didnt look well when he last saw her 
early last week she had gray hair and was very thin peterson 
said she looked very pathetic 
when miss garbo traveled it was with the air of a phantom 
slipping in and out of airports wearing dark glasses and a slouch 
hat pulled down she was usually only a few steps ahead of 
persistent photographers who stalked her incessantly and 
occasionally managed to steal a quick shot of the face 
her mostremembered line was in grand hotel when she said 
i want to be alone she was also reputed to have said the same 
to reporters although she once insisted to a friend that what she 
had said was i want to be let alone 
in comments published in life magazine in 1989 garbo described 
herself as a sour little creature 
i dont want any kind of attention from anybody except that i 
know that someone likes me and thats nice otherwise its 
sickening she said 
rumors of love affairs were plentiful but she never married and 
in her later years allowed only a few longtime friends to 
penetrate her solitudefew would discuss the star knowing they 
would lose her friendship if they did but those who did comment 
indicated they had never been allowed to know her secrets 
she was born greta lovisa gustaffson in stockholm on sept 18 
1905 the daughter of an uneducated laborer who was often ill or 
unemployed after her father died when she was 14 she left school 
to become a barbers helper and later a 25amonth department 
store clerk 
while clerking in the hat department she was chosen to appear 
in a filmed hat advertisement stagestruck the 17yearold greta 
enrolled in stockholms royal dramatic theater academy and haunted 
film studios seeking work she won several bit parts the first in 
a 1923 comedy titled peter the tramp 
but her big break came when mauritz stiller then swedens 
leading director visited the academy and discovered the tall 
angular beauty he made her his protege changed her name to garbo 
and starred her in his 1924 silent movie the atonement of gosta 
berling 
the film depicted her wrapped in furs and huddled in a 
horsedrawn sled as it sped away from a pack of pursuing wolves at 
the first sight of miss garbo on film stiller said her face 
you only get a face like that in front of a camera once in a 
century 
stillers film caught the attention of hollywood movie tycoon 
louis b mayer who offered the director a contract at 
metrogoldwynmayer studios stiller agreed on the condition that 
miss garbo be signed too 
she stepped onto american soil in 1925 and from her first 
american appearance in the silent film the torrent miss garbo 
captivated audiences 
her career soared with such silent films as flesh and the 
devil the divine woman and woman of affairs but when 
talkies began studio officials feared her voice might not please 
audiences they were wrong 
talking pictures revealed her throaty sensual voice and further 
enhanced her appeal she became an international sensation drawing 
rave reviews in mata hari grand hotel queen christina 
and many more 
many film buffs can recite her first spoken line to a bartender 
at a waterfront saloon in anna christie 
gimme a viskey ginger ale on the side and dont be stingy 
baby 
response to the sight of her chisled features and lithe body 
sometimes was so frenzied that the phenomenon became known as 
garbomania 
by the 1930s she was reportedly earning between 250000 to 
300000 a picture 
her leading men included some of the greatest stars of the time 
clark gable in susan lennox john barrymore in grand 
hotel fredric march in anna karenina robert taylor in 
camille and charles boyer in conquest

at various times she was reported to be ready to marry actor 
john gilbert maestro leopold stokowski health food enthusiast 
gayelord hauser and director rouben mamoulian but as she had said 
early in her career marriage i have said over and over again 
that i do not know 
her career began to wane in the late 1930s but bounced back with 
the comedy ninotchka which prompted marquees across america to 
blaze garbo laughs but her next attempt at a humorous role in 
twofaced woman flopped and miss garbo announced her retirement 
in 1941 
in 1949 she went to italy to film la duchesse de langlais 
but the project was delayed and eventually fell through 
miss garbo a millionaire through many investments had no need 
to work again she never did 
although nominated four times for academy awards she didnt win 
one until 1955 a special oscar for a series of luminous and 
unforgettable performances she did not appear to collect it 
she became an american citizen in 1951 and moved her permanent 
home from hollywood to manhattan where she sometimes used the name 
harriet brown she also maintained a residence in klosters 
switzerland 
garbo watchers would wait hours outside her apartment 
hoping to catch a glimpse of her 
details of her private life rarely leaked out but in the 1940s 
she was linked with russianborn entrepreneur george schlee whose 
wife valentina designed miss garbos clothes she purchased an 
apartment in the schlees building the entrepreneur was soon 
traveling alone with miss garbo although he remained married 
the relationship lasted nearly 25 years until schlee died in 
1964 
her enduring popularity was evident when in the 1960s dozens of 
garbo festivals were held worldwide but miss garbo as always 
remained aloof 
in a rare interview in 1928 she said there are many things 
in your heart you can never tell to another person they are you 
your private joys and sorrows and you can never tell them you 
cheapen yourself the inside of yourself when you tell them 
when she saw the words in print miss garbo was furious with the 
writer i do not like your story she said 
however in 1985 sven broman a swedish magazine publisher and 
garbo biographer released details of conversations he said he had 
had the summer before with the actress 
according to broman miss garbo said she longed to return to 
sweden but feared the resulting commotion 
neighbor buttenweiser said he had known the actress for 35 
years he said he sometimes discussed world developments with 
garbo but said she wouldnt talk about her film career 
she wanted to know about germany about europe she wanted to 
know what was going on in new york said buttenweiser she was 
a very interesting person 
for most of her life the actress apparently decided to let her 
films speak for her 
the result of our life should bear witness to what we are 
what we will do what we can achieve she said as a budding 
teenage star and our work tells this best in its own language 
mine happens to be the language of the motion picture screen 
new york hospital spokesman banoff said the family had asked 
that instead of flowers donations be made to a kidney treatment 
center at the hospital 
he said he didnt know who the family members were but 
neighbors said miss garbo had a niece 
he said services would be private

thoughts of the those who died at hillsborough in the football 
association cup semifinal game between liverpool and nottingham 
forest a match that should have been one of the highlights of the 
season 
and at 306 pm the 15000 fell silence for a minute to 
remember those who were crushed or suffocated when police opened a 
stadium gate to alleviate crowding outside the stadium as the 
crowd rushed into the already filled terrace or standingroom 
section many were crushed against antiriot fences and barriers 
circling the field 
the tragedy has led to plans to improve crowd control at english 
soccer grounds including the compulsory switch to allseat 
stadiums 
but those measures were a long way from the thoughts of the 
supporters and their families at anfield sunday 
liverpool its city and its football clubs are renowned for 
their family spirit liverpools roman catholic archbishop derek

by students who say she doesnt embody the wellesley experience 
mrs bush is scheduled to speak at graduation ceremonies june 1

to honor barbara bush as a commencement speaker is to honor a 
woman who has gained recognition through the achievements of her 
husband which contradicts what we have been taught over our years 
at wellesley said a petition signed by 150 students 
the petition was recently presented to college president nanerl 
keohane 
senior susie cardenas who helped organize the petition drive 
said mrs bush is not representative and does not embody the 
wellesley experience what were trying to go after in life 
wellesley spokeswoman laura stavis defended the invitation 
the point of fact is mrs bush holds a very important 
position stavis said she is and continues to be involved in 
crucial issues literacy volunteer programs for the needy and the 
homeless i feel she speaks with her own voice 
anna perez a spokeswoman for mrs bushs office in washington 
said sunday she would have no comment on the students petition 
not all students agreed with the protest 
i think its fabulous we can get someone that prestigious to 
speak said junior carrie workman i dont think you can write 
her off as just marrying a famous man 
other students expressed concern about the presence of security 
and secret service agents on campus on graduation day 
its a private day said senior helen yannatos its what 
we worked for years for it will take away from it in a sense

you wont be through with taxes for the year 
even if you beat the midnight monday deadline for filing your 
federal return the average american will have to work through may 
5 to satisfy the tax collectors 
if that prediction by the tax foundation proves accurate it 
will be the latest tax freedom day on record and two days later 
than 1989 
the reason is simple the nonpartisan research organization said 
sunday in announcing the mythical date tax increases will 
outpace the growth in individuals income during 1990 
tax freedom day is the foundations estimate of how long it 
would take an average person to pay his or her state federal and 
local taxes if all income went for taxes until they were all paid 
for the year 1990

interest rates on bank deposits were reduced by 
126 percentage points in a move aimed at stimulating chinas 
sluggish economy 
the peoples bank of china said sunday the new rates would apply 
to deposits by individuals enterprises and institutions the 
official press reported 
it follows a decision by the central bank to lower interest 
rates on business loans also by 126 percentage points on march 
21 
the interest rate on a oneyear deposit will fall to 1008 
percent from 1134 percent while the rate for a threeyear deposit 
will drop to 1188 percent from 1314 percent 
lower deposit rates could encourage people to put less of their 
income into savings and spend more giving the economy a needed 
boost 
tough austerity measures imposed in late 1988 have succeeded in 
reducing inflation from a high of more than 30 percent to about 4 
percent in february but at the cost of a sharp economic slowdown 
that has chilled consumer demand and led to thousands of plant 
closures 
in recent months the government concerned about economic 
recession has begun easing its tight credit policies and 
increasing the money supply to bail out debtridden companies 
peoples bank governor li guixian said the reduction of interest 
rates on loans in march would cut enterprise debt burdens by 17 
billion yuan a year or the equivalent of 36 billion
