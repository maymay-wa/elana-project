members of amnesty international on sunday 
called on gov bill clinton to grant clemency to two men facing 
capital punishment including one who would be the first person 
executed in arkansas in 26 years 
about 50 members of the human rights group held a 26minute 
vigil on the steps of the state capital 
cynthia crawford of little rock read a statement imploring 
clinton not to end the decency of the past 26 years by 
reinstituting this brutish form of violence 
we ask that he heed the words of mrs coretta scott king a 
woman left widowed by a murderer but who still opposes the death 
penalty an evil deed is not redeemed by an evil deed of 
retaliation 
john edward swindler 46 is scheduled to be executed monday 
night for the 1976 slaying of a fort smith policeman if he is put 
to death he would be the first person executed in arkansas in 26 
years 
clinton last week denied swindlers request that his death 
sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole the us 
supreme court on saturday denied 72 swindlers appeal for a stay 
of execution 
on june 25 ronald gene simmons is scheduled to die by lethal 
injection for the 1987 slayings of 16 people including 14 family 
members he has declined to appeal his death sentences saying he 
wants to die 
the members of amnesty international in arkansas are repulsed 
at this reactivation of this states machinery of death crawford 
said just as amnesty international opposes any use of torture 
we also oppose executions the ultimate form of torture 
there was no counterprotest but someone in a passing car 
shouted out burn swindler burn 
crawford urged citizens who oppose the death penalty to wear 
black armbands on the execution days 
but the mother of slain police officer randy basnett said the 
execution would not be a sad event for her it will be a very 
happy occasion said peggy basnett

soldier in a northern town sunday but the dayold ceasefire 
between government soldiers and insurgents held in other areas of 
the country officials said 
a second soldier died sunday of wounds inflicted in a saturday 
sniper attack 
the government blamed the rebels for several other ceasefire 
violations but said they could be due to lack of communications 
with remote places a spokesman for the rebels said the 
ceasefire appeared to be holding 
a joint governmentrebel delegation was scheduled to tour the 
ceasefire area tuesday the government said 
the tour was previously scheduled for monday and no reason was 
given for the postponement 
at least 376 people were killed in northern and eastern sri 
lanka since monday when tamil tiger rebels broke a 13monthold 
truce 
the death toll was compiled from accounts by witnesses military 
sources and rebel officials the government has acknowledged losing 
only 40 soldiers while the tigers admit only 72 guerrilla deaths 
the ceasefire went into effect at 6 pm saturday five days 
after the tigers besieged about 20 police stations and captured 
more than 850 policemen the government rushed reinforcements to 
the area and claimed to have retaken seven stations before the 
ceasefire 
there has been no word on the fate of the policemen but 
military sources and a lone survivor said 137 of the police were 
disarmed and massacred by rebels

john sununu wields his clout in washington 
these days but his influence still is felt in the state he governed 
for six years before being tapped as george bushs chief of staff 
new hampshires immediate past governor is seen as a smooth 
operator who does favors for his adopted home state but leaves few 
political fingerprints 
some state republicans express concern that sununu is meddling 
in local politics but most consider his presence in the white 
house to be an asset for the state 
sununu makes certain new hampshires place on the political 
map is not forgotten said gop strategist tom rath 
it was not an accident that the first place outside of 
washington that the president visited was new hampshire rath 
said referring to a bush stopover in manchester not long after he 
became president 
as new hampshires governor sununu sided early with bush in the 
1988 presidential race he helped engineer a bush victory in the 
states earliestinthenation primary and continued the national 
campaign with attacks against democratic nominee michael dukakis 
governor of neighboring massachusetts 
sununus political work continues even now he had a guiding 
role in easing the white houses handsoff policy toward party 
primaries putting the oval office behind candidates such as rep 
bob smith rnh who hopes to replace retiring gop sen gordon 
humphrey 
state gop chairwoman rhona charbonneau wishes sununu had stayed 
out of the primary race between smith and rye lawyer tom christo 
its good to have a friend in the white house rather than a 
foe she said but i truly wish they had kept out of the 
primary i dont believe anybody not even the white house should 
be involved 
sununu whose influence also can be seen in some state races 
brushes off the criticism 
were not trying to pick candidates he says were trying 
to help the process 
his wife nancy hasnt kept silent either she said she 
considered challenging us rep chuck douglas for the gop 
nomination in new hampshires 2nd congressional district because 
she never appreciated his values and his morals 
sununu and his successor in the governors mansion republican 
judd gregg have what insiders consider a civil relationship at 
best at a recent new hampshire business dinner sununu sat next to 
senate president william bartlett who was considering challenging 
gregg 
sununu 50 is described as bushs righthand man part of a 
white house troika with secretary of state james baker and budget 
director richard darman 
many doubted the abrasive sununu would last long in the white 
house job after an admittedly rocky start but now even his critics 
have had to admit he appears to be effective and may wield more 
power than any other recent chief of staff 
most republican politicians believe it is to new hampshires 
advantage to have sununu in the white house 
we may not get everything from the white house but people at 
the white house have the ear of new hampshire said bill zeliff 
a sununu ally who is seeking the gop nomination for smiths 
congressional seat 
sununu is seen as helping to place new hampshire operatives in 
federal positions promoting the seabrook nuclear power plant and 
ensuring that important promises are fulfilled 
when the navy threatened 1000 jobs by canceling a 128 million 
submarine overhaul at the portsmouth naval shipyard maine and new 
hampshire governors and congressional delegations won a pledge by 
the navy to find replacement work 
humphrey credits sununu with making the navy deliver 
when those promises started to filter down the navy 
bureaucracy was sidestepping it so i called sununu and he got them 
to do what they said they would do humphrey recalls 
humphrey said sununu is clearing similar hurdles for a proposal 
the senator is championing to make a wildlife refuge out of some of 
the land to be abandoned when pease air force base closes 
a string of people with new hampshire connections have been 
appointed to federal posts since sununu moved to washington most 
recently wally stickney a sununu friend and associate was 
selected to head the federal emergency management agency 
a highly placed republican who agreed to discuss sununu only if 
not quoted by name said sununu is adept at maintaining a low 
profile in the state 
he hasnt left any fingerprints or left anyone with a story 
that they can tell that sununu sidled up to me and so on 
seabrook the republican said falls into that category sununu 
champion of the nuclear power plant when he was governor didnt 
just go to the nuclear regulatory commission and say give them 
the license the source said 
hes been very cautious but seabrook got the license didnt 
it he made sure his feelings on the topic were well known in the 
appropriate places 
sununu plays down his role in the licensing of seabrook 
i was a patient man he said recently i knew the right 
thing would happen

two years ago carl marriotts farm fields were dusty his 
soybeans were shriveled his prospects bleak this spring he has a 
different brown sickly crop but theres a different culprit rain 
yes rain the manna from heaven midwest farmers hoped and 
prayed for these past few years has flooded fields delayed 
planting and damaged crops but survivors of one or even two 
consecutive droughts arent complaining 
we just roll with the punches weve got options we can pull 
out of the bag when its wet said marriott a southern illinois 
farmer who may lose a quarter of his waterlogged wheat crop when 
its dry theres nothing we can do 
weve been biting our tongues said mark white a chariton 
iowa farmer whose fields were parched in 1988 and 89 then too 
muddy to work all last month ill take a wet year over a dry 
year anytime at least youve got a chance to grow something 
after the most devastating decade in half a century marred by 
drought high interest rates and plummeting land values many 
farmers have entered the 1990s with one of the wettest springs in 
recent times and the brightest outlook in 10 years 
the farmer is in the best shape hes been since 1980 said 
gregory hanson an economist at the us agriculture department 
weve got rising land values rising sales rising investment 
im not trying to paint a pollyanna picture on the other hand 
theres the famous rubber ball theory of economics what bounced 
down is now bouncing up 
though an unseasonably cool wet spring may prevent a bumper 
crop the economic forecast is promising cash income for the farm 
sector which includes government subsidies has been projected at 
55 billion to 59 billion for 1990 a record if it reaches the 
outer limit and better than last years estimated 54 billion 
hog and cattle prices are at or near record levels corn prices 
are up because the surplus is down farm exports have increased 
land values are expected to rise about 4 percent in 1990 about 
the same level they did in 1989 and machinery sales have jumped 
by 50 percent in the last four years 
when i look at the farm economy i look at a growth sector 
hanson said ten years ago it was a sector ready to take a 
fall 
the national farm debt which peaked in 1983 at 206 billion 
could dip to as low as 145 billion in 1990 he said 
farmers who survived the 80s are smarter and more careful about 
their purchases said neil harl an economics professor at iowa 
state university 
some have been burned some were singed some were just close 
to the heat he said at the same time he added lenders are 
more cautious and conservative 
as the new decade begins some signs of a turnaround are due to 
the weather some to a reversal in economic fortunes for example 
in kansas a record winter wheat crop is forecast for 1990 
4602 million bushels more than double last years 
droughtbattered 2136 million bushels 
theyre laughing jim shroyer extension agronomist at 
kansas state university said of the farmers theyre really 
looking forward to harvest this really lifts their spirits 
nationally winter wheat production is expected to reach a 
nineyear high of 2 billion bushels despite some losses from wet 
weather 
in iowa land values jumped nearly 45 percent from 1986 to 
1989 though theyre still far below 1981 peak levels less than 
one in five farmers had significant money troubles last year 
compared with a third in 1986 harl said 
in minnesota state officials say soil moisture is the best it 
has been since november 1986 
despite such optimistic signs drought persists in areas 
including florida and parts of colorado in california in its 
fourth straight dry year reservoirs are low enough that the state 
and us bureau of reclamation cut in half the amount of this 
years irrigation water to farmers 
and in the upper midwest even though puddles in the fields make 
people smile a recent wet spell in north dakota was dubbed the 
milliondollar rain they havent convinced anyone the drought 
is over 
by no means are we out of the woods said tim edman special 
assistant to south dakota gov george mickelson if we go back to 
the 90degreeplus windy dry weather conditions we could be 
facing a proble very quickly just as serious as the last two 
years 
in 1988 all of south dakota was declared a drought disaster 
area last year it was twothirds of the state 
while many cursed the drought others now say rainy cool 
weather is no blessing 
in michigan for example some apple growers say its reduced 
their crop in missouri a fourth of the corn is in poor or very 
poor shape and planting is five weeks behind schedule and in 
illinois pastures with water bellyhigh to the livestock and 
fields too muddy to put a tractor in have farmers worried 
its rained so much our wheat is full of blight said herman 
krone who welcomed thenpresident reagan to his shriveled southern 
illinois farm fields in 1988 instead of ripening its dying in 
standing water its been 43 years since ive seen something 
like this 
but its too early to make dire predictions and dry sunny days 
last week allowed many farmers to get back into the fields some 
also say as time runs out to plant corn they may switch to 
soybeans which have a later growing season 
thats an option for marriott a fourthgeneration farmer who 
normally would have planted all his corn by now but had completed 
less than 5 percent by the second week of june a situation to 
which hes resigned 
farming is hills and valleys he said you have good crops 
some years and some years good prices seldom together 
its either feast or famine said bill million agriculture 
extension adviser in adams county in western illinois farmers 
are just taking it one day at a time 
not long ago million said they looked to the skies for 
salvation rain 
now theyre praying for it to stop just a bit he said 
typical human beings were never satisfied

on thanksgiving eve of 1984 randall robinson 
a black american walked into the south african embassy on 
massachusetts avenue in voice as smooth as worn saddle leather he 
chatted amiably for nearly an hour with thenambassador bernardus 
fourie when it was time to go he wouldnt 
not until he insisted south africa freed nelson mandela and 
all its black people 
that night in the dc jail robinson wondered where his first 
arrest for civil disobedience would lead america still was caught 
up in its own civil rights debate arguments raging over 
affirmative action and school busing the middle east central 
america eastern europe the cold war with the soviet union and the 
trade war with japan dominated its global concerns 
south africa was as far south on that list as it is on the map 
no more robinson now 48 is executive director of transafrica 
a lobbying group for black africa and this week he is bringing 
nelson mandela to the united states to ticker tape and yankee 
stadium in new york city to hollywood and the coliseum in los 
angeles to the oval office and congress in washington and to all 
the front pages in between 
and when he sends mandela home it will be with millions of 
dollars to replenish the cashstarved accounts of the african 
national congress to help it repatriate thousands of poor exiled 
members and reestablish internal operations after three decades of 
official banishment 
of greater import it will be with the assurance that this 
nation having lavished its affection on a man who strode so 
elegantly from his prison cell onto the international stage last 
february will not retreat from its economic sanctions against the 
south african government no matter how badly the bush 
administration might wish it so 
mandela 71 is coming to pick the fruits of political stardom 
just as lech walesa did a year ago the difference is that walesa 
the hero of eastern europes flood tide of democracy arrived the 
conquering hero mandela after nearly 28 years in prison is out 
of jail but he is not yet free said new york mayor david 
dinkins alluding to the south africa laws that still bar blacks 
from full voting privileges and the right to travel and live 
wherever they choose 
so mandela is sure to stir the special emotion that americans 
reserve for the heroic underdog that fondness is far less 
transitory than the cheers accorded victors though mandela may 
return one day in that role too 
robinson and other organizers of the mandela visit have set a 
34event 8city agenda that would gladden the heart and tax the 
energy of any rock star and any politician starting with the 
tickertape parade in manhattan on wednesday and ending with a 
rally at the oakland coliseum 10 days later 
other stops include boston atlanta miami detroit los angeles 
and washington where mandela will meet bush at the white house and 
address a joint session of congress something no black american 
has done 
mandela is likely to raise at least 8 million along the way 
from 5 general admission tickets at yankee stadium where 60000 
are expected to flock to 25000perplate dinners for corporate 
and showbusiness sympathizers a washington firm that manages the 
financial affairs of athletic superstars proserv expects to gross 
another 3 million from the sale of mandela tshirts posters 
coins souvenir mugs and other promotional items 
all of this said anc spokesman victor mashabela is 
powerful and positive 
and doubtlessly a little dismaying to the bush administration 
which will publicly embrace mandela as heartily as anyone but which 
would prefer that his american accolades for courage be shared with 
the man who released him south african president frederik w de 
klerk 
bushs predecessor ronald reagan unsuccessfully vetoed the 
1986 law that barred most trade with south africa bush has argued 
as did reagan that more american commerce would be a greater force 
for peaceful change than stiff sanctions 
recently the administration quietly suggested to key members of 
congress that sanctions be relaxed when pretoria meets the minimum 
conditions of the antiapartheid act particularly ending the 
national state of emergency and freeing all political prisoners 
earlier this month de klerk lifted the state of emergency in 
all but natal province but there are still south africans in 
prison for political reasons 
congressional leaders declared that it was too soon to consider 
easing sanctions and the administration backed down and the 
anticipated outpouring of public support for mandela during his 
us visit is sure to bolster congressional resolve on the issue 
mandela while effusive in his praise for de klerks gestures 
continues to insist that they should not be rewarded with any 
easing of us economic pressures that would be a grave 
mistake he said last week it would be regarded by the people 
of south africa as a stab in the back 
compounding any argument to the contrary by bush is the 
governments embarrassment over a recent report by the cox news 
service that the cia was responsible for mandelas capture 28 years 
ago having tipped the south african government to his whereabouts 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater initially declared we find 
no value in reviewing a 30yearold history in this case but his 
subsequent plea belied a greater sensitivity this happened 
during the john f kennedy administration dont beat me up 
for what the kennedy people did 
mandela a man of charity toward his aggrievers is not likely 
to rub that one in he wont need to he is coming a hero to 
americans known for viewing foreign leaders as either good guys or 
bad by the time he leaves it may be difficult for george bush or 
anyone else to persuade them to see the conflict between white and 
black south africa in shades of gray 
sometime later this summer de klerk too will come to 
washington he too will dine at the white house but he will not 
hear the roar of the american crowd the cheers that this week will 
belong to nelson mandela

high school students boycott kelloggs 
products mineworkers picket shell oil offices a rap music group 
cuts a song with the message dont buy gold jewelry from south 
africa 
americans have weighed the arguments on south africas racially 
separate society and many have lodged protests large and small 
against apartheid some march some lobby some talk with their 
pocketbooks 
do americans care about sanctions id say so when you have 80 
cities 25 states and 15 countries that have passed binding 
measures restricting their investments in or their purchases in 
companies that do business in south africa says jim casen of the 
american committee on africa a new yorkbased antiapartheid group 
westchester ny recently pulled 40 million out of citibank 
to protest that companys rescheduling of south africas debt 
another recent example the state of new jersey sold 42 billion 
in securities of companies involved in south africa 
by all accounts the us sanctions have taken a serious 
economic and psychological toll on south africa this week black 
leader nelson mandela tours the united states with this message 
please keep up the economic pressure 
international trade sanctions alone have probably resulted in 
a 2 billion loss annually to the south african economy said 
stephen r lewis jr president of carleton college and author of 
the economics of apartheid 
although fewer than 1 percent of south africans are employed by 
american companies in south africa the sanctions sent the white 
government a signal that it could no longer kid itself that 
united states would come down on its side he said 
american blacks have played a major role behind the us 
sanctions policy the black community has been a key and they 
have become a firm base of the antiapartheid movement casen 
said 
black politicians in concert with peace groups labor and 
college students have spearheaded grassroots campaigns against 
us business in south africa 
even on the eve of mandelas visit antiapartheid activists 
have maintained pressure for instance the cocacola co has been 
rebuffed in its efforts to support mandelas eightcity tour 
this company is still profiting from apartheid and hence we 
cant have any relationship with it said tandiluthuli gcabashe 
coordinator of an international coke boycott and a member of the 
welcoming committee for mandela in atlanta coke divested its 
bottling plants in south africa in 1986 but still sells its 
concentrate there 
the first organized efforts to use us economic power against 
south africa date from the early 1960s after the sharpeville 
massacre and the jailing of african national congress leaders 
including mandela mandela was released in february after 27 years 
in prison 
lewis said south africa has struck a chord with americans where 
other foreign policy issues have failed because apartheid is so 
egregious and so obviously unfair 
perhaps the most visible grassroots campaign against south 
africa was organized by transafrica the washingtonbased africa 
lobby on thanksgiving day 1984 the group began wellpublicized 
daily marches outside the south african embassy in washington 
often ending with the orchestrated arrest of congressmen or 
celebrities 
the marches coincided with increasing violence in south africa 
as that countrys white leaders tried to suppress uprisings in the 
black communities television brought the violence into every 
american home 
the antiapartheid activists most striking success came in 
october 1986 when congress passed a comprehensive sanctions bill 
overriding thenpresident reagans veto 
they finally made an impact on the whites said pauline 
baker of the sanctions the economy was in irreversible 
decline said ms baker a south africa expert at the carnegie 
endowment for international peace 
the sanctions include a ban on the importation of south african 
agricultural products textiles uranium ore iron steel and coal 
an end to new loans to south african businesses an end to new us 
investment and a shutdown of us oil exports to south africa 
additionally the united states does not sell pretoria military 
equipment computer technology and other items that might be used 
to enforce apartheid 
on the eve of mandelas visit to the united states there have 
been rumblings that the bush administration might lift some 
sanctions but congress imposed specific conditions for ending the 
sanctions not all of which have been met for instance all 
democratic political activity must be legalized before sanctions 
are removed according to the legislation 
while sanctions have damaged the south african economy and 
ultimately contributed to the relaxation of apartheid experts say 
they have not been totally effective 
although the south african economy is vulnerable to further 
sanctions it has no realistic achilles heel said a recent 
report by the investor responsibility research center a group that 
monitors business activity in south africa 
only a collapse in demand for south african gold or n 
effective oil embargo would be likely to have crippling effects 
and neither of these sanctions appears imminent the report said 
south africas economy is fueled largely by the sale of gold and 
other minerals including diamonds gold accounts for 45 percent of 
south africas export earnings 
sanctions against gold are relatively ineffective a general 
accounting office report said last october it noted that millions 
of dollars worth of south african gold and diamonds reach us 
consumers annually in the form of jewelry which was not banned 
some members of congress have also been upset because the united 
states has allowed about 900000 tons of south african steel to 
enter the country despite the antiapartheid laws 
there is no excuse for the administration to allow even one 
ounce of such products to enter the united states said rep 
john bryant dtexas the administration allows the steel imports 
because us lawyers have differentiated between steel and 
fabricated steel products like girders and beams

a shy little owl is about to slow the 
flow of logladen trucks through this and other timber towns 
freckling the pacific northwest 
the federal government is expected this week to list the 
northern spotted owl as threatened by heavy logging on and near 
the owls virgin forest habitat the action eventually could halt 
logging on up to 8 million acres of timber most of it controlled 
by the us forest service 
there is no doubt the us fish and wildlife service will list 
the owl as threatened and move to protect it said sen mark 
hatfield rore he and other northwest leaders have searched for 
compromise in the long and bitter fight between the timber industry 
and environmentalists over the fate of northwest forests huge 
swaths of which are hundreds of years old 
its going to throw us into a depression says norma craig 
who owns a flower shop here this is a cruel thing to do to 
timber families that somebody back east can make a decision about 
an owl and ruin the timber industry 
but environmental leaders whose lawsuits to protect the owl and 
its old growth habitat provoked the major upheaval facing the 
timber industry are elated 
the spotted owl is the canary in the coal mine whose health 
gauges the vitality of the canopied cathedrallike forests where 
it nests and roams said jim pissot director of the audubon 
society of washington 
weve been overcutting for years and now one of the richest 
biologicial treasures in the country our ancient forest is 
literally on its last legs he said the listing of the spotted 
owl will begin its recovery its absolutely a disgrace that weve 
been cutting these magnificent centuriesold trees 
the old trees are prized by loggers for their huge girth and 
fine grain 
the forest service estimates that its 12 national forests in 
washington oregon and northern california contain about 4 million 
acres of oldgrowth timber the wilderness society has called the 
figure inflated 
the economic and social impacts of logging limits still are not 
fully known they will depend on several variables including how 
government biologists interpret the endangered species act to 
protect owl habitat and on inevitable court challenges washington 
lands commissioner brian boyle said 
the forest service is awaiting interpretations before estimating 
the size of timber shutdowns but forest service biologist jack 
ward thomas and government colleagues recommend that about 8 
million acres of mostly federal forests be shut to logging about 
half the federal land now available for logging 
that would cost the region about 28000 timber jobs over five 
years a federal study contends but regional leaders and logging 
groups say the employment impact could be much greater 
washington gov booth gardner and oregon gov neil goldschmidt 
recently commissioned a study on the effects on employment logging 
towns and timber prices 
reductions in northwest timber harvests will have relatively 
little impact on the regions overall economy said chang mook 
sohn washington states chief revenue forecaster and oregons 
former state economist 
he said logging and milling accounts for 2 percent of employment 
in washington and about 6 percent in oregon in california it 
accounts for less than a half percent of total employment said 
karen terrill of the california department of forestry oregon 
will feel it the most sohn said 
individual timber communities will be greatly hurt said david 
mendoza a spokesman for the washington department of employment 
security 
people will be stuck with devalued property and no work he 
said many lack the skills to do other things it is going to 
devastate some of these towns 
president bush said last week he is concerned about the impact 
on timber communities but would oppose retraining timber workers at 
federal expense 
the northwest congressional delegation is confident it will win 
a measure now in conference committee to ease the pain a curb on 
exports of unprocessed logs from stateowned lands that would 
increase supply to domestic mills squeezed by heavy asian demand 
and falling supplies of private timber due to heavy cutting by 
law federal timber cannot be exported 
even without federal closures timber workers face hard times 
said washingtons dan evans a former republican us senator and 
governor 
the timber industry has not been completely honest in this 
whole thing evans said even without the spotted owl 
situation the idea that they could maintain the current level of 
cut into the future indefinitely is just crazy

a constitutional amendment to protect the stars and stripes 
enjoys wide popularity in state legislatures but most of them have 
finished their business for the year and wont consider 
ratification anytime soon 
there will be overwhelming support said georgia state rep 
bill lee chairman of the house rules committee id lead the 
charge but georgia like more than half the states has no 
regular legislative session set until 1991 
an associated press survey of state legislative leaders found 
strong support in more than half of the nations statehouses for an 
amendment banning flag desecration 
but skepticism in more than a dozen states and legislative 
timetables mean there will be no rush to ratification even if 
congress approves an amendment this summer the delay could give 
emotions time to die down and opponents time to regroup 
the supreme court issued its 54 decision june 11 three days 
before flag day that flag burning is a form of political protest 
protected by the first amendment the ruling threw out a law passed 
by congress after a similar high court ruling a year ago 
republican leaders immediately vowed to press for a 27th 
amendment to the constitution they are aiming for a vote before 
july 4 
such a measure would have to pass congress by a twothirds vote 
in each house and then be ratified by legislatures in 
threequarters or 38 of the states 
an ap survey following the supreme court decision found strong 
support for the amendment particularly in the south and midwest 
legislative leaders stressed that the situation could change 
particularly since most votes would take place after the november 
elections 
among the states where the amendments chances look good 
alabama arizona arkansas california delaware florida georgia 
idaho illinois indiana kentucky louisiana maine 
massachusetts mississippi missouri montana nevada new 
hampshire north dakota ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania 
rhode island south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah 
west virginia and wyoming 
in many of those states legislators angered by last years 
supreme court decision have already passed some law or resolution 
against flag burning 
in pennsylvania home of betsy ross resolutions asking congress 
to seek a flagburning amendment easily passed both chambers and 
similar action is predicted on ratification 
in this state it would be like voting against apple pie or 
motherhood said senate minority leader robert j mellow a 
democrat 
states where skeptics could force a fight include alaska 
colorado hawaii iowa kansas maryland michigan minnesota 
nebraska new mexico north carolina vermont virginia washington 
and wisconsin 
in new york the powerful assembly speaker democrat mel miller 
strongly opposes an amendment and is in a position to block it 
only a handful of states have yearround legislatures by 
midjune most legislatures have adjourned for the year or are near 
adjournment including most of the states most strongly behind the 
amendment 
louisianas house has passed a bill reducing to a token fine the 
penalty for beating up a flagburner a senate committee endorsed 
that bill last week but the legislature adjourns july 9 
illinois legislature adjourns june 30 but gov james thompson 
a republican said friday he would call a special session to hasten 
a ratification vote 
the last amendment to the constitution which lowered the voting 
age to 18 took a little more than three months from its passage in 
congress in march 1971 to its ratification by 38 states 
this time with all but a handful of legislatures finished for 
the year or nearly so no such speedy action is possible 
it would be a fiveyear process if it worked said the 
majority leader in the arizona senate republican john mawhinney 
it would not be something that rolled through we would not push 
to be the first state

nearly 4 years after christa mcauliffe 
died new hampshire residents who burst with pride at her 
accomplishment and cried in sorrow at her death have a place to 
continue her journey 
the states official memorial to the concord high school social 
studies teacher the stateoftheart christa mcauliffe 
planetarium opens to the public this week its been open for 
school groups since march 
the staff sees this place as a memorial to her dreams more 
than a memorial to her as a person director clinton hatchett 
said it is a memorial to her goals and what she wanted to do for 
education and that is what we have tried to live by in creating our 
programs 
mcauliffe chosen from among 11000 teachers to be the first 
private citizen in space died with six other crew members of the 
space shuttle challenger the sparkling pyramidshaped planetarium 
is within sight of her hillside resting place 
a state commission selected the planetarium as the states 
official memorial to mcauliffe from scores of suggestions which 
included a statue portrait or state holiday 
after viewing a demonstration program for the school opening in 
march mcauliffes husband steven said he thought the planetarium 
staff had lived up to his wifes goals 
i know christa would be delighted he said 
thursdays dedication features nasa administrator richard truly 
who helped reorganize the space program after the 1986 disaster 
and white house chief of staff john sununu as governor sununu 
tearfully led a statehouse service in mcauliffes memory 
one of the most popular items in the 26 million planetarium is 
its computerized multimedia presentation that allows audience 
members to vote electronically on what destinations they want 
to go to and what they want to do when they get there 
with moving pictures and sound a demonstration program took 
viewers inside the human body rode them around in an atom and 
along a musical journey through geometric shapes at times the 
feeling of motion was dizzying and spectators held on to the arms 
of their seats for balance 
some groups may spend most of their time not going out beyond 
jupiter and another group might head all the way out to the outer 
solar system right away hatchett said 
hatchett said the system also can be programmed for 
presentations on geology meteorology art the history of music or 
the demise of the dinosaurs 
more than 12000 school children have visited the planetarium 
since march hatchett said the only complaint he heard was that the 
program was too short 
the planetarium is expected to be a big public attraction but 
its main goal is to be a classroom with programs designed for 
different age groups and skills and for teacher workshops 
hatchett said mcauliffes memory pervades the building from the 
lobby that features her smiling portrait to digital equipment 
corp computers donated by the company to run the mindboggling 
programs 
the contractors that have worked on the building and have been 
involved in donating time and materials have done it because of 
christa mcauliffe and what she stood for how the community feels 
about the whole situation and her having a dream tha was not met 
hatchett said they want to help meet that goal here 
hatchett said its almost like the teacherastronaut is looking 
over their shoulders 
i dont feel that she is here in any kind of mystical way but 
in our minds we are always thinking how would christa feel about 
this would she be happy about this

the parents of a gold miner kidnapped by 
colombian guerrillas said saturday they planned to go to south 
american so they can work more effectively for their sons release 
it looks like im going to have to go and get him out marge 
heimdal of peoria said in a telephone interview from a location 
where she and her two daughters have sought refuge from the news 
media 
scott heimdal 27 who worked for the iminco a gold mining 
company in quito ecuador was kidnapped april 28 while traveling 
on business along the bermeja river near ecuadors border with 
colombia 
officials have said a band of the peoples liberation army 
attacked his canoe killing the pilot and taking heimdal and an 
ecuadoran hostage 
mrs hemidal said something big is going to happen in two or 
three days things will be handled but she would not explain 
what she meant 
in a development friday peoria television station whoi reported 
that heimdals kidnapping might not have been a random act of 
terrorism but a plot involving a former mining company employee to 
extract money from the company 
in a fourday fundraising push last week the heimdals raised 
60000 from peoria residents believing it would meet the 
kidnappers ransom demands but they learned wednesday that the 
kidnappers actually wanted 612000 
on thursday the heimdals made public a fourpage letter from 
their son in which he said he was being moved daily in the jungle 
and surviving on armadillo and monkey meat

bulgarians cast ballots sunday in an 
election runoff that may give former communists a majority in the 
countrys first freely elected parliament in 58 years 
the main opposition parties have said they wont join in a 
coalition government with the excommunists 
but there were indications that leaders of the socialists the 
former communists and the opposition might support a government 
run by nonpartisan technocrats 
the vote comes one week after an initial round of balloting last 
sunday the first free elections in bulgaria since 1932 
the socialists won the most seats in the first round 172 in the 
400seat unicameral grand national assembly the main opposition 
alliance the union of democratic forces was second with 107 
seats and other opposition groups won a total of 40 seats 
the socialists who carried out democratic reforms after ousting 
longtime communist leader todor zhivkov last year need only 29 of 
the 81 seats up for grabs sunday for a majority 
polls open at 7 am and close at 6 pm final results were not 
expected until later in the week 
at final rallies late friday socialist party leader alexander 
lilov predicted a powerful victory in the runoff 
one opposition leader rumen vodenicharov told 10000 
supporters that the second round is a referendum for democracy 
even if the socialists win outright they will be faced with a 
strong opposition in parliament and will no longer be able to 
expect automatic approval of their policies 
the mainstream agrarian party a former docile ally of the 
communists during their four decades of rule earlier this year 
declared their independence and have rejected entering any 
coalition with the socialists leaders of the agrarian party which 
garned only 8 percent of the vote in the first round have called 
on its voters to back the democratic front on sunday 
in an interview carried saturday by the socialist daily duma 
premier andrei lukanov said national consensus is absolutely 
necessary with a government comprised only of bsp socialist 
members this cannot be realized he has repeatedly said he would 
not head such a cabinet 
however the democratic front has repeatedly ruled out a 
coalition with the former communists 
front leader zhelyu zhelev spoke thursday of a government of 
competent people of experts who are nonpartisan 
that idea sources said saturday is also shared by president 
petar mladenov and other leading socialists 
ivailo trifonov a close associate of zhelev hinted there was a 
possibility of such a solution 
while no agreement had been reached within the 16party 
democratic front trifonov said friday if we arrive at this 
possibility it should be a government of nonpartisan experts 
such a solution would be a coalition through the backdoor 
said a western diplomat saturday who insisted on anonymity 
the main task of the parliament will be to draft a new 
constitution and enact legislation designed to lead this nation of 
9 million out of its deep economic crisis 
under bulgarias electoral law half the seats are distributed 
according to the percentage of votes each party receives under the 
proportional system the other half go to individual candidates 
elected by direct ballot

a gold bar plucked by an underwater robot 
from a shipwreck in 1500 feet of water off southwest florida 
provides strong evidence that treasure hunters have located part of 
a goldladen fleet sunk in 1622 
official seals of the spanish crown on the 1 pound 8 ounce bar 
indicate it may be part of a fleet of ships lost in a 1622 
hurricane in the treacherous waters south of key west said marine 
archaeologist robert marx 
the bar resembles gold carried by the nuestra senora de atocha 
a galleon discovered in shallow water in the keys by treasure 
hunter mel fisher in 1985 that discovery yielded gold and 
artifacts worth 400 million 
the latest wreck is the first intact spanish galleon ever found 
in deep water the treasure hunter said 
seahawk deep ocean technology founded by marx in 1986 spotted 
the gold bar last week during part of a survey in preparation for 
archaeological excavation 75 miles from land said seahawk director 
dan bagley iii 
since gold bars often had marks lending clues to the ships 
identity our excavation team decided to bring this piece up to 
investigate immediately rather than completing the survey and 
coming back bagley said 
of particular interest is the marking en rada stamped into 
the metal which also was found on some of the atochas gold bars 
other seals indicate that it was documented gold not 
contraband being brought back to spain marx said 
the first artifact retrieved to identify the ship was a bell 
recovered last summer by the companys smaller remotely operated 
vehicle but the bar confirms that the ship could yield a major 
treasure bagley said 
we feel the information weve gleaned from this artifact goes 
a long way in help us verify which ship we have bagley said 
we are very encouraged by this 
while we are being very cautious and not predicting the name 
of the vessel it appears it was one of the galleons disignated to 
carry official treasure in the same time frame the atocha was 
lost bagley said

fighting erupted sunday in a palestinian 
refugee camp between rival factions of the guerrilla group led by 
terrorist mastermind abu nidal leaving at least four people dead 
and 15 wounded police said 
the fighting broke out around midnight at the rashidiyeh refugee 
camp and continued until 9 am when guerrillas from yasser 
arafats mainstream palestine liberation organization intervened 
supporters and opponents of abu nidal representing rival wings 
of his fatahrevolutionary council fought in the narrow alleys of 
the shantytown with mortars machine guns and rocketpropelled 
grenades according to police and palestinian sources 
the showdown was the bloodiest in lebanon between the two 
factions since an antiabu nidal mutiny began in the 
fatahrevolutionary council ranks three years ago 
rashidiyeh about 50 miles south of beirut houses 18500 
palestinians registered by the united nations relief and works 
agency as well as a few thousand unregistered refugees 
the sources requesting anonymity said abu nidals opponents 
backed by fighters of the plos largest faction fatah occupied a 
school run by unrwa which cares for palestinian refugees 
the threestory school building overlooks the main position held 
by abu nidals loyalists 
the abu nidal opponents demanded that his supporters surrender 
or risk being dislodged by force the sources said 
forty abu nidal loyalists surrendered after the mediation of 
representatives of other plo groups the fatahrevolutionary 
council is outside the plo which brings together nine palestinian 
groups 
the fighting flared up after the shooting death in rashidiyeh 
saturday of omar hamadeh an abu nidal loyalist who was tyre 
regional commander of the fatahrevolutionary council his 
bodyguard mohammed meri was wounded in the shootout with fighters 
from the fatah group 
on friday a plo official was shot to death at his home in 
rashidiyeh no group has claimed responsibility but a plo 
statement blamed the killing on israeli collaborators seeking to 
provoke clashes between arafat loyalists and opponents in the camps 
fatahrevolutionary council and fatah are at odds because of a 
bitter feud over policy between abu nidal whose real name is sabri 
albanna and arafat 
the dispute within the fatahrevolutionary council began in 1987 
shortly after abu nidal moved his headquarters from syria to libya 
abu nidal opponents and plo officials have said that abu nidal 
had 22 close aides gunned down at his base in libya the killings 
followed a meeting of the groups ruling politburo and guerrilla 
commanders 
about 300 fatahrevolutionary council guerrillas fled from libya 
to algeria forming an opposition group led by abdulrahman issa a 
member of the politburo and atef abu bakr the groups spokesman 
issa was wounded in an assassination attempt in algiers earlier 
this year that was blamed on abu nidal 
most of the abu nidal opponents have infiltrated to lebanon in 
the past year 
abu nidal is believed to be in libya despite reports that 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi was seeking his ouster in order 
to distance himself from international terrorism 
a us state department report last year described abu nidal as 
the worlds most dangerous terrorist 
it blamed his group for 34 terrorist attacks in 20 countries 
since he split from the plo in 1973 at least 900 people were 
killed or wounded in these attacks the report said

the first righttodie case to reach the 
supreme court is among two dozen still awaiting decision by the 
justices before they embark on a summerlong recess 
the court will announce rulings twice this week on monday and 
thursday and could wrap up its term next week 
the most closely watched case awaiting decision centers on the 
asserted constitutional right to withdraw lifesustaining medical 
treatment including feeding tubes 
the issue is presented in the case of nancy cruzan a 
permanently unconscious missouri woman being kept alive with food 
and water supplied through a tube surgically implanted in her 
stomach 
ms cruzans parents want to end her life but the missouri 
supreme court bucking a trend among courts nationwide refused in 
1988 to let doctors remove the feeding tube 
many experts expect the nations highest court to issue a 
narrowly worded ruling but whatever the justices say likely will 
have an enormous impact in the continuing national debate 
also awaiting decision before the end of the term are cases on 
the abortion rights of young girls the future scope of political 
patronage the rights of people charged with child abuse to 
confront their young accusers and the validity of federal policies 
that favor women and minorities in awarding broadcast licenses 
the court is studying laws in ohio and minnesota that ban 
abortions for unmarried young girls unless their parents are 
notified beforehand 
the decisions are not expected to affect the courts 1973 roe 
vs wade ruling that legalized abortion 
the justices have been studying an illinois dispute over the 
power of government employers to base hiring transfer and 
promotion decisions on an employees political affiliation 
the court significantly weakened the political patronage system 
a decade ago when it barred government employers from firing anyone 
even some policymaking and confidential government workers 
solely because of their political party unless party loyalty is 
required for effective performance 
but the prior rulings dealt only with firings now the court 
must say whether the same constitutional protections apply to 
hirings transfers and promotions 
cases from maryland and idaho ask the court to decide whether 
people charged with child abuse have the right to at least one 
facetoface confrontation with their young accusers 
what the justices must decide is whether the constitution allows 
exceptions to such potentially traumatic encounters 
in an important test of its continued support of affirmative 
action the court is reviewing the federal communications 
commissions policies of giving women and minorities special 
preferences when awarding broadcast licenses 
the policies are being challenged in cases from florida and 
connecticut as unconstitutionally discriminatory against white men 
other controversies expected to be resolved before the court 
term ends include 
the scope of authority enjoyed by the federal program 
protecting the pensions of 30 million american workers to order 
employers to restore terminated pension plans government lawyers 
told the justices a potential financial crisis for the program 
hangs in the balance 
a freedomofspeech dispute from maryland over a ban on all 
soliciting at most of the nations post offices 
whether police violate the rights of motorists suspected of 
drunken driving by videotaping their responses before warning them 
of their right to remain silent or have a lawyer present such 
police tactics are under attack in a pennsylvania case 
an ohio dispute that asks whether the constitutions 
freespeech protections immunize all expressions of opinion as 
opposed to assertions of fact from libel lawsuits

about 2300 weekend soldiers in period 
costumes marched back in time sunday to restage napoleons last 
stand the 1815 battle of waterloo 
there was much smoke but no fire as they redid the battle on 
the very site where napoleons grande armee of 70000 suffered its 
final defeat by more than 100000 british dutch belgian german 
and prussian troops allied under the duke of wellington 
sundays ranks featured history buffs of all ages from the 
victorious counties as well as france the united states canada 
and even the soviet union organizers said

butte du lion a 130foot mound topped by a lion overlooking the 
farmlands near waterloo today a brussels suburb where napoleon 
lost his empire 
they watched soldiers in 19th century uniforms on foot and 
horseback moving across grassy knolls wielding muskets sabres and 
military banners 
the sound of cannon fire fifes drums and bagpipes filled the 
air as the soldiers moving shoulder to shoulder repeated the 
events of june 18 1815 
the battle has been revisited in previous years under the 
auspices of the british napoleonic society which even supplies a 
napoleon and a duke of wellington 
but sundays show was to mark the real events 175th 
anniversary among the spectators was the current and eighth 
duke of wellington lord arthur valerian wellesley 
the festivities began saturday with a lightandsound show and

sundays battle was broadcast live on rtbf belgiums 
frenchlanguage television network the 90minute reenactment 
showed soldiers firing and dying in the fields that roll toward 
the french border 30 miles away 
of course napoleon lost again 
after his first defeat in 1814 napoleon went to the 
mediterranean island of elba he returned to mainland france on 
march 20 1815 rounded up an army and set out to fight the allies 
in belgium and regain his empire whose roots lay in the french 
revolution of 1789 
the real battle lasted a day and seemed made in hollywood the 
bad guy might have won if not for the lastminute arrival of 
marshal gebhard bluechers prussian troops who turned the tide for 
the allies 
estimates of the dead at waterloo range from 12000 to 50000 
plus 10000 horses the injured numbered 40000 many of whom were 
robbed by local townsfolk and riffraff that followed armies around 
europe in those days 
napoleon was shipped to the south atlantic island of st helena 
where he died and was buried in 1821 years later his body was 
returned to paris 
the waterloo battlefield an area of 1 by 3 miles was named 
a historic site in 1914 and urban development is banned there 
even so this has not prevented a proliferation of tawdry 
souvenir shops and restaurants offering battlefield specials 
in recent decades tourism has dropped sharply from a high of a 
million visitors a year in the 1950s 
nothing reflects this more than the dilapidated building next 
to the memorial mound which offers a 360degree view of the battle

dame eva turner a dramatic soprano of 
extraordinary range and power and a memorable star of puccinis 
turandot has died she was 98 
miss turner who had suffered a broken hip three months ago 
died saturday at devonshire hospital in london said katherine 
morgan a relative 
blessed with a powerful voice and an extraordinary range miss 
turner was one of the first british sopranos to achieve stardom in 
europe 
her voice of enormous proportions in its prime ranging from g 
to top d and her generous personality were admirably suited to the 
dramatic soprano roles in verdi and wagner the late harold 
rosenthal longtime editor of opera magazine once wrote 
born march 10 1892 in oldham lancashire she joined the royal 
carl rosa opera company in london in 1916 she made her debut a 
year later as a page in wagners tannhaeuser and rapidly took 
on lead roles in productions of tosca aida and madama 
butterfly 
ettore panizza assistant to the great italian conductor arturo 
toscanini heard miss turner in a 1924 production of madama 
butterfly and arranged an audition 
toscanini was enchanted 
miss turner made her debut at la scala in milan in 1924 as freia 
in wagners das rheingold and toured with an italian company 
in germany in 1925 
it was extremely rare for a british soprano to go abroad like 
that and her becoming acknowledged on the continent really paved 
the way for some people in the next generation said katherine 
wilkinson a spokeswoman for the royal opera company 
in brescia in 1926 she made her first appearance in 
turandot she did not create the role but franco alfano the 
composer who completed turandot after giacomo puccinis death 
said he considered her the ideal singer for the part 
from 1950 to 1959 she was a professor of voice at the university 
of oklahoma she then returned to london and was a professor of 
voice at the royal academy of music until 1966 she continued to 
coach singers until recent years 
in 1982 she was honored at a 90th birthday celebration at the 
royal opera house in covent garden where a packed house gave her a 
10minute standing ovation she was also made an honorary citizen 
of oklahoma in that year 
she was made a dame commander of the order of the british empire 
in 1962 and was awarded honorary doctorates of music by manchester 
and oxford universities 
some of miss turners performances are preserved on recordings 
recently reissued on compact discs among them are highlights of 
turandot at the royal opera house in 1928 conducted by sir 
john barbirolli 
ronald crichton reviewing the recording for the financial 
times praised the glorious security and thrust of miss 
turners singing while raymond monelle in the independent said the 
old recordings testified to her shattering power 
miss turner never married and left no immediate survivors 
funeral arrangements were to be announced monday miss morgan 
said

the towering spruce jagged mountains 
vast glaciers and lush islands of the tongass national forest are a 
world away from washington dc where the forests future is 
being decided 
after four years of debate federal legislation affecting the 
way americas largest national forest is managed is near a final 
resolution 
last week the senate approved additional restrictions on 
logging in the tongass sending the legislation to a conference 
committee to work out differences with a more restrictive house 
version 
the end of the tongass debate cant come soon enough for 
residents of this remote rain forest along the alaska panhandle 
many feel threatened by what they consider a foreign attack on 
their way of life 
congress doesnt live here they dont really understand the 
lifestyle said tobe miller whose husband works for a logging 
company in wrangell weve been painted to be butchers of the 
forest and we find that very offensive 
they have no comprehension of the size of the forest up 
here said patricia bickar a retired teacher in sitka they 
think that the whole thing is going to look like the iowa wheat 
fields when we get through 
the tongass is big almost beyond comprehension at 167 million 
acres it is larger than new jersey massachusetts rhode island 
delaware and connecticut combined but only 60000 people call it 
home most within the towns of juneau ketchikan and sitka 
bordered by british columbia on the east and the pacific ocean 
on the west the tongass is a spectacular landscape of snowcapped 
peaks immense glaciers and ice fields and thousands of islands 
and reefs much of it is thickly carpeted with spruce hemlock and 
cedar 
the forest stretches from the southern tip of the panhandle 500 
miles north to yakutat bay but the combined shorelines of the 
mainland and islands total nearly 11000 miles 
the forests top products are wood and pulp most of which are 
sold to japan the tongass is rich in other resources as well 
including fish gold silver and other minerals its diverse 
ecosystem is home to thick populations of grizzly and black bear 
deer and bald eagles 
much of the forest is ice rock or swampy marsh only 56 
percent 94 million acres is actually forested and of that 
only 31 million acres is outside protected wilderness areas and 
suitable for logging and regrowth on a sustained basis according 
to us forest service estimates 
only part of that acreage contains the oldgrowth highvolume 
timber prized by the industry and environmentalists alike and its 
that land that all the debate is about in congress 
the oldgrowth includes stands of trees hundreds of years old 
which provide valuable habitat for wildlife and shade for prime 
salmonspawning streams 
it is the last and best representation of major intact stands 
of oldgrowth timber in a temperate rain forest in the world 
said bart koehler executive director of the southeast alaska 
conservation council 
to the industry however the tongass is an overripe forest don 
finney general manager of the alaska loggers association notes 
that much of the fiber content of tongass logs is good only for 
pulp production 
by logging the old trees and carefully managing the second 
growth a more productive forest emerges to help meet the constant 
worldwide demand for wood products finney says 
which is fine if all you care about is wood fiber koehler 
responds but there are a lot more values to the forest than 
that 
in the middle of this debate is regional forester michael barton 
of the forest service what it boils down to barton says is 
values 
theres a segment of the public both here and down south 
that would like to see alaska preserved or frozen in time he 
said then there are other folks who are trying to make a home 
and a living up here who want their kids to have jobs up here 
the fundamental issue is should we develop the resources or 
should we not 
congress has been debating since the 1970s how to reconcile the 
competing needs of the loggers fishermen indians tourists and 
recreationalists who use the tongass 
in 1980 congress set aside 54 million acres from logging in 
exchange it guaranteed the regions two pulp mills a supply of 
timber totaling 45 billion board feet a decade it also promised 
to appropriate at least 40 million a year for road building and 
other assistance to make the timber available 
the tradeoffs to the industry came under fire in the mid80s 
at the same time as environmentalists raised new concerns about the 
biological uniqueness of oldgrowth forests 
the tongass legislation passed by the house last july would 
establish 23 new wilderness areas totaling 18 million acres on 
which logging and other development would be banned the bill also 
would require 100foot protective margins or buffers along 
major salmonspawning streams and their tributaries 
the senate version would add no wilderness areas but would set 
aside 673000 acres from logging it would provide buffers for 
major streams but not for tributaries 
both versions would end the annual 40 million appropriation and 
the timbersale guarantee the housepassed bill also would cancel 
two unusual longterm harvesting contracts with the pulp mills 
dating back to the 1950s while the senate version would modify the 
contracts 
environmentalists favor the house version while industry 
officials prefer the senate plan the white house has endorsed the 
senate bill

a reputed west german terrorist was living in 
east germany with the approval of the secret police when she 
allegedly helped bomb a us air base officials said sunday 
west german federal prosecutor alexander von stahl said he was 
investigating whether there was evidence to charge former communist 
leader erich honecker and members of his ousted regime with 
supporting leftist terrorism against west germany 
the disclosure came after the arrests of seven suspected members 
of the radical leftwing red army faction which has been blamed 
for dozens of killings bombings and kidnappings in west germany in 
the past two decades 
the suspects had been living in east germany under false names 
and some told police that they were in regular contact with the 
feared secret police of east germanys former communist regime 
authorities late friday captured sigrid sternebeck 40 the 
seventh alleged red army faction member arrested in a 10day span 
she was arrested at her apartment near the east german city of 
frankfurt an der oder 
ms sternebeck told authorities that she moved to east germany 
in 1980 and kept in regular contact with the secret police who 
found her a place to live according to a statement released sunday 
by east germanys interior ministry 
but she denied that she had any contact with the red army 
faction after moving to east germany the ministry said through the 
government news agency adn 
west german authorities say she is linked to the august 1985 
death of a us army soldier who was lured from a discotheque in 
wiesbaden west germany and then shot to death 
the soldiers identity card was then used to drive a car laden 
with explosives onto the rheinmain us air base near frankfurt 
west germany 
two americans were killed in the blast and 20 people were 
injured the red army faction later claimed responsibility for the 
soldiers death and the bombing 
sundays editions of the west german newspaper welt am sonntag 
quoted stahl as saying he would look into whether there is evidence 
to begin preliminary proceedings against former east german 
officials for allegedly supporting and harboring terrorists 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the west german federal 
prosecutors office confirmed the report and said there already 
were initial suspicions but not enough evidence yet to pursue 
extradition 
foerster said there was a priority inquiry involving 
honecker former minister for state security erich mielke the head 
of the secret police and former east german espionage chief markus 
wolf 
honeckers regime was ousted in october by mass demonstrations 
he and mielke are among several leaders undergoing medical 
examinations to determine whether they are competent to face 
prosecution in east germany on charges of abuse of office and 
corruption 
of the seven terrorist suspects arrested one of them christine 
duemlein 41 was freed because a west german warrant for her 
arrest had expired 
east german authorities meanwhile turned down west german 
extradition requests for three other suspected terrorists werner 
lotze monika helbing und ekkehard von seckendorffgudent 
the interior ministry statement gave no reason for the action 
and foerster said west german authorities would reapply 
lawyer rolf henrich who is representing seckerdorffgudent and 
ms helbing questioned whether west german federal police could 
legally operate in east germany 
twentyfour core members of the red army faction are still being 
sought 
two west german bankers a wealthy industrialist a west berlin 
judge and a us army lieutenant colonel were among the people 
killed in attacks for which the red army faction claimed 
responsibility

a us official arrived sunday to 
investigate whether the south korean government is behind a 
controversial public campaign that has resulted in a sharp drop in 
imports of consumer items 
wayne berman a counselor to us commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher is to visit south korean department stores to check the 
accuracy of news reports that highpriced foreign consumer goods 
have been removed from shelves and foreign brandname boutiques 
have been closed 
despite repeated denials by south korean officials us and 
west european diplomats in seoul say they believe the government is 
behind the antiimport campaign 
we have evidence that korean officials were involved it is 
unfortunate that such thing can give ammunition to trade 
protectionists in the united states said a us embassy 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the official said that although the volume of foreign consumer 
goods affected is small the antiimport campaign is serious 
because it is visible and can affect the future attitude of 
korean consumers 
imports of consumer goods account for less than 5 percent of 
south koreas total imports which consist mainly of raw materials 
needed to produce goods for export according to government figures 
the antiimport campaign began because of south koreas 
worsening trade balance the country had a trade deficit of 3 
billion in the first quarter of this year and may have a deficit in 
1990 for the first time since 1985 
the government and media blamed the worsening trade balance in 
part on rising imports of luxury foreign consumer goods 
although the volume of such products is low 
the controversy erupted after some foreign consumer goods such 
as golf clubs brandname clothes and refrigerators suddenly 
disappeared from the shelves of leading department stores in seoul 
at hyundai department store owned by the giant hyundai group 
which exported 220000 cars last year about a dozen boutiques for 
such foreign brand names such as burberrys bally lanvin and 
yvessaint laurent were closed 
we did it for two reasons low profits and new social 
obligation said hyundais senior manager choi changkon we 
also considered the mounting public sensitivity against a luxurious 
way of life 
he denied that the action was ordered by the government but said 
hyundai was aware of the governments repeated calls for austerity 
to cope with current economic difficulties 
lotte and other leading department stores in seoul also said 
they were planning to close boutiques or reduce the space for 
foreign goods 
one of the most seriously affected products is the usmade 
mercury sable car whose sales plummeted with the antiimport 
campaign 
the sable made by ford motor corp became the bestselling 
imported car in south korea soon after it was first introduced last 
october in the last three months of the year 998 sables were sold 
far more than all other imported cars combined 
but sales dropped to 105 in may from 280 in february 224 in 
march and 159 in april kia motors co the south korean importer 
of the car said it has lowered its sales projection for this year 
from the original 3000 to 2000

irans oil minister said sunday that his 
countrys oil production capacity will rise more than 25 percent to 
45 million barrels a day in two years 
the announcement in tehran said iran is spending hundreds of 
milions of dollars to repair damage to the industry from the 
198088 iraniraq war irans oil industry produces 90 percent of 
its foreign currency revenues 
the minister gholamreza aqazadeh stressed that iran would 
adhere to the production quota of 314 million barrels a day set by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries even though its 
capacity was larger than that 
aqazadeh told a news conference that irans output capacity in 
march was 33 million barrels a day he said then that iran would 
be able to pump 37 million barrels a day by the end of july up to 
4 million barrels a day next year and 45 million barrels in 1992 
his comments were reported by irans official islamic republic 
news agency and monitored in cyprus 
industry analysts say that much of irans infrastructure is 
aging and estimate that modernization to increase its output could 
cost as much as 8 billion 
iran and iraq have criticized other opec members for violating 
production quotas and driving down prices a practice that costs 
their flagging economies millions of dollars a day 
on sunday aqazadeh blamed saudi arabia and kuwait for 
fluctuating oil prices 
worldwide prices have fallen below opecs benchmark price of 18 
per barrel and analysts have blamed the drop on oversupply on 
friday the price for west texas intermediate the benchmark us 
crude oil fell 51 cents to 1662 
the cartels 13 member states agreed in may to cut their 
collective output by 1445 million barrels a day to restore the 
benchmark price they set the overall production ceiling at 22086 
million barrels a day 
aqazadeh said iran will rebuild jetties and reservoirs on 
southern kharg island that were devastated by iraqi air raids he 
said a petrochemical complex on the persian gulf coast will produce 
1 million tons of liquefied petroleum gas in the coming months 
aqazadeh also said iran will drill 100 wells in the caspian sea 
which it shares with the soviet union the oil reserves there were 
completely independent of the soviet fields he said

the cia is refocusing its operations to look 
at issues such as international economic competitiveness terrorism 
and narcotics but some experts say the agency is moving too slowly 
to keep up with changes in the postcold war world 
the collapse of the berlin wall and the disintegration of the 
warsaw pact have tempered the great ussoviet rivalry and 
prompted the cia to undertake a wideranging selfanalysis to 
determine what it should be doing and where it should be going 
the transformation of our intelligence priorities is 
beginning sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate 
intelligence committee wrote in an opinion piece in sundays 
editions of the new york times 
the congressional oversight committees are working with the 
cia to develop an innovative longterm strategy that sheds cold 
war priorities and focuses on language and cultural skills and 
economic expertise boren wrote 
at cias langley va complex in the bucolic woods overlooking 
the potomac river a senior intelligence official said there was 
great debate under way about the agencys future 
there is more intellectual excitement in this building than 
there has been in years the official said in an interview last 
week he asked not to be identified by name 
at the same time the official said the cia was navigating in 
choppy seas that make predicting a difficult job particularly 
when foreigners themselves are unclear about their future for 
instance he said no one had a crystal ball to see that romania and 
bulgaria would chose communist governments in their elections 
the agency meantime is eyeing nervously budget cuts being made 
by congress in the defense department where most of the money for 
intelligence is put the official said 
the intelligence budget which includes money for the cias 
sister agencies such as the defense intelligence agency and the 
national security agency was estimated to be about 28 billion in 
fiscal year 1990 the intelligence agencies want to avoid any 
proportional hit when defense is pared 
the intelligence community will be scrutinized said rep 
david mccurdy dokla chairman of the house intelligence 
subcommittee on oversight and evaluation i see cuts in those 
areas that primarily support military functions 
covert action the area that has brought the agency its 
greatest notoriety comprises only about 3 percent of the cias 
budget the bulk of the agencys work involves analyzing voluminous 
data from various sources 
practicing their own form of glasnost cia officials and some 
members of congress these days speak forthrightly about unique 
opportunities in 1990 for reevaluating operations and goals as 
well as the daunting challenges 
but they insist intelligence needs will not diminish theyll 
simply be different 
the era of the cloak and dagger may be over but the cloaks 
are likely to multiply and become even more pervasive in their 
effort to procure military industrial and commercial secrets 
said sen william cohen of maine the ranking republican on the 
senate intelligence panel 
it is time to face new enemies drugs terrorism poverty 
brush fire wars and pollution of our planet he said 
and while some spies will come in from the cold many more 
will bask and flourish cohen said 
boren agrees the growth area is the industrial espionage 
that is carried out by foreign governments against private us 
companies 
more and more the aim of espionage is to steal private 
commercial secrets for the sake of national economic purpose 
boren told the national press club recently 
were going to have to know about foreign governments 
intentions for oil production levels exchange rates and trade 
policies he said were going to have to protect our own 
commercial enterprises against the theft of commercial secrets 
david whipple executive director of the association of former 
intelligence officers predicted the intelligence agencies are 
looking forward to a very prosperous future 
but some observers are concerned that the cia a cumbersome 
bureaucracy may not be up to the task of retooling its operations 
i think they understand the pressure and the demands for 
reexamination and a development of the new strategic plan but i 
think they are a long way from accomplishing it mccurdy said 
i have not been satisfied with the pace of change he said 
there desperately needs to be a new look at the whole thing 
he added 
mccurdy said he is concerned that the cia has too few 
independent thinkers linguists women and minorities and 
creative geniuses 
he complained that the new crop of cia employees all look like 
penn state linebackers he said such conformity is 
counterproductive to understanding a changing world full of people 
from different races and backgrounds 
one example might be the restless nationalities in the soviet 
union jeffrey richelson author of a recent book americas 
secret eyes in space said it frequently takes years to develop a 
reporting network that will allow the cia to know the ins and outs 
of say politics in azerbaijan 
but the agency is optimistic about the future and cia director 
william webster says the man who really counts president bush a 
former cia director himself has no gripes 
the president has mentioned that he is pleased with the 
product he is getting webster said

the public broadcasting service is looking at 
ways to provide 1992 presidential candidates and the major 
political parties free air time beyond the normal news coverage to 
present their views pbs president bruce christensen said sunday 
what were looking for is the way to increase the political 
dialogue christensen said in a telephone interview from dallas 
where pbs board of directors is meeting this week 
christensen said just what approaches will be used need to be 
worked out over the next few months but he said the 
possibilities include several ideas recommended friday to top pbs 
officials by the john and mary markle foundation of new york 
the foundation which will formally present a feasibility study 
to the pbs board on tuesday has offered to contribute 5 million 
of the estimated 15 million to 20 million that the project would 
cost 
developed by alvin h perlmutter an independent television 
producer the markle study recommends that pbs offer free air time 
in blocks ranging from 2 minutes to 15 minutes to the presidential 
candidates andor the political parties 
the markle plan was outlined in sunday editions of the 
washington post and the new york times 
perlmutter who has worked for pbs and nbc recommended creating 
a voters channel production company to prepare expanded 
political programing for pbs stations that also would include 
character and competence profiles of presidential candidates 
and an exploration of their debates 
regularly scheduled onehour programs would be broadcast during 
september and october 1992 with halfhour programs airing daily 
the week before the november general election 
the report also recommended that the programs include segments 
examining political ads and party activities in the campaign and 
the medias coverage of it and it called for a segment in which 
voters could voice their views on the candidates and the issues 
al made a number of suggestions well consider christensen 
said predicting most of the 337 public tv channels in the pbs 
system will sign on to what we are doing

why thats what marcia biancardis 
friends wanted to know long after word of the popular cheerleaders 
apparent suicide came over beverly high schools public address 
system on valentines day 
it was a question that lingered until last week when the 
4monthold case took a rare twist marcias mother was charged 
with taking a shotgun and shooting the 16yearold as she slept 
all along we just wanted the facts said sophomore eric 
wade who was a year behind marcia none of us believed it was a 
suicide 
now the counselors who initially helped students confront 
suicide are trying to help them accept what authorities say was a 
homicide 
the mother susan biancardi is charged with firstdegree murder 
and could face life in prison if convicted her attorney robert f 
peck jr says mrs biancardi was linked to her daughters death 
through innuendo hearsay and suggestion he entered an 
innocent plea for her tuesday 
he also indicated tuesday that he did not think his client was 
mentally ill and described her as an active loving parent and 
wife the salem evening news reported 
for some kids theres fear and for some theres anger said 
lauren terry who counsels students at beverly high school about 
15 miles north of boston for a lot of them it has finally put a 
closure on a long long spring 
when mrs biancardi was arrested last week following an inquest 
into her daughters death feb 14 it fell into line with what many 
of marcias friends had suspected from the start 
even that first day it was very clear that there were 
questions surrounding the death said kimberly wilkins who 
directs the communitys project rap crisis response center 
and that made it really tough for the kids to start going 
through the process of grieving 
classmates couldnt make it add up they didnt understand why a 
wellloved girl with a passion for singing sports and people would 
take her own life had they missed some hint of suicidal despair 
there also were questions about how marcia manipulated the 
shotgun to shoot herself in the abdomen and why if she pulled the 
trigger there was no trace of gunpowder on her hands 
its much easier to understand that someone else shot a gun 
with suicide we dont understand why said terry whose caseload 
has tripled since marcia died 
marcias father a bricklayer was not at home at the time of 
the shooting but her 14yearold sister was in the house 
witnesses at the salem district court inquest included scores of 
the girls friends and relatives many of whom were familiar with 
the sometimes stormy relationship she had with her parents 
stephen oconnell spokesman for the essex county district 
attorney and police said they had ruled out suicide but declined 
to comment on the inquest or any specific problems in the family or 
between the mother and daughter 
yes we knew her life was not perfect the rev donald 
remick of the second congregational church had said at marcias 
funeral though none but god knows all her pain we do know that 
in the midst of the suffering and struggle a choice was made 
the choice authorities now say was not marcias 
mrs biancardi was placed under 20 days psychiatric observation 
in a state mental hospital according to james fox of northeastern 
universitys national crime analysis program only two or three 
times a year on average is a mother suspected of shooting a 
teenage daughter in the united states 
wilkins said the filing of charges is very scary for teens 
in the area 
adolescence is typically a time when kids test their parents 
and then you have a case that raises the possibility of a 
murderous potential in all parents said wilkins 
in the days after marcia died her classmates began pinning 
notes stuffed animals and flowers on her locker 
school officials following the advice of experts quietly 
removed the mementos they thought could romanticize or glorify what 
at the time appeared to be a suicide 
now at least its not something a question we have to 
carry around with us said richard cooper a graduating senior 
but its not something we can forget the loss of our friend 
maybe counselors said now is the time to remember 
gestures such as the memorial hockey game that administrators 
vetoed in the winter seem more appropriate now students are 
talking about dedicating next years yearbook and prom to marcia 
who would have graduated in 1991 
the kids will need a catharsis now some constructive way to 
deal with their grief said dr pamela cantor a suicide expert 
affiliated with the harvard medical school they need to talk 
about the fact that a mother is under arrest

the kid is 11 years old 4 feet 
tall and weighs 57 pounds but charlie korsmo came close to 
stealing the show from his elders in the new dick tracy movie 
wasnt he great exclaimed the kids costar and director 
warren beatty last week after the film had its premiere here 
charlies first movie role was as jessica langes son in men 
dont leave initially he wasnt interested in the role offered 
by beatty in the film based on the squarejawed comic strip 
character 
but beatty insisted and the sixthgrader from minneapolis 
finally agreed partly because i hate to go to school 
now charlie considers himself one lucky kid 
everybody says the movie will be a hit so it will probably 
help my career says the slightly built youngster who professes 
more interest in becoming a philosopher than a fulltime actor when 
he grows up 
i would sit around and think a lot like inventions and 
theories and stuff like that and then give advice to others he 
says of his real goal in life

when the world last looked bernice albertine 
king was a fidgety 5yearold in white ribbons piled sorrowfully 
in her mothers lap at her fathers 1968 funeral 
now the baby daughter of the rev martin luther king jr is a 
serene young woman newly ordained as a baptist minister and holder 
of doctor of law and master of divinity degrees from emory 
university 
ms king 27 is the only one of the slain civil rights leaders 
four children to follow her fathers career and join the clergy 
she has a longrange goal of starting a prison ministry that also 
would provide inmates with some legal counseling 
the broader goal of continuing the sweeping social change begun 
by her father is not on her agenda ms king explains but she 
understands why people would take her entry into the ministry as a 
sign that she intends to go in that direction 
thats part of being who i am she explains ive learned 
to live with that 
my father was more concerned with sociology the sociological 
reasons for behavior she says i am more interested in the 
psychological i like to analyze things to look at how things 
happened to figure out why they happened 
ms king describes herself as an ambitious but private person 
she carries herself with an air so coolly serious that friends 
often tell her she needs to lighten up 
ms king said she might begin to do that after a summer of 
reading the bible studying for bar exams and interviewing for jobs 
with atlantaarea law firms 
she was ordained and received both her law and divinity degrees 
all on the same day last month 
part of her serious nature ms king said stems from soul 
searching in her early adulthood when she spent a lot of time 
running from the religious calling she felt at age 17 
she thought briefly about a career as a television reporter she 
participated in some antiapartheid protests went to jail after 
one of them she also attended democratic conventions represented 
her church at baptist assemblies and spoke before the united 
nations 
but by the time ms king earned a bachelors degree in 
psychology from spelman college she had a clearer idea of what she 
wanted to do in life 
she then enrolled at emory and in 1988 gave a trial sermon 
that whipped into a weeping frenzy the congregation at ebenezer 
the baptist church presided over by both her father and grandfather 
at her ordination the rev joseph l roberts ebenezers pastor 
and one of ms kings instructors at emory said she has not only 
the oratorical gifts of her father but the sensitivity of her 
father 
ms king said she considered taking broadcasting courses to 
sharpen that powerful speaking ability 
i always felt i needed to work on the way i choose words i 
still have difficulty with that she said and ive always 
admired the way broadcasters speak

a vaccine to combat the aids virus likely will 
be available for widespread use by the end of the decade a 
government aids expert said sunday 
the bush administration has come under fire from aids activists 
and congressional critics for not spending enough money on aids 
research and moving too slowly in approving new drugs to fight the 
disease 
the federal government is spending 116 billion in the current 
fiscal year on aids research and the administration has recommended 
an increase to 1245 billion in fiscal 1991 
but dr anthony fauci director of aids research at the national 
institutes of health said sunday that the decade of the 90s 
will see some important advances that will have a positive impact 
on hivinfected individuals 
over the next several years youll see a real acceleration of 
vaccine development and hopefully by the end of the 1990s there 
will be a vaccine that is available for widespread use fauci 
said 
an estimated 1 million americans are believed to be infected by 
hiv or human immunodeficiency virus which can develop into the 
aids disease 
fauci appeared on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley in advance of the sixth international aids conference 
which starts wednesday in san francisco 
the conference billed as the largest gathering to date of hiv 
scientists health care workers and policymakers will run through 
june 24 
the meeting will be boycotted however by 80 organizations 
because of us immigration policy that bars entry to people 
infected with the hiv virus the immigration and naturalization 
service in april relaxed the ban by allowing 10day visas for 
conference participants but some groups feel that is not 
sufficient 
a preconference demonstration is planned tuesday outside the 
immigration office in san franciscos financial district 
while conceding that a cure for aids hasnt been found fauci 
said at least a couple of drugs have been shown effective in 
delaying the full symptoms of the disease in patients at the 
earlier stages 
dr luc montagnier an aids researcher at frances pasteur 
institute who also appeared on the brinkley show said it will take 
at least four to five years to develop an effective vaccine 
montagnier said government funding for aids research in the 
united states has been enormous in the past two years or so 
compared with europe 
fauci said were already starting to see positive spinoffs 
from aids research such as information that can be used in work on 
cancer and studies of the immune system 
the aids conference which coincides with the annual gay pride 
week is sponsored by the world health organization the university 
of california at san francisco the american foundation for aids 
research and the citycounty of san francisco

flirting with history on an emotional 
anniversary east germanys parliament came dramatically close 
sunday to dissolving the country and uniting with west germany 
but the stunning move turned out to be more a symbolic gesture 
and acknowledgment that unification was imminent and inevitable 
the countrys first freely elected parliament voted 
overwhelmingly to discuss the final decision of german unification 
but then put off the historic decision that would automatically 
result in immediate unification 
lawmakers met in a rare sunday session to debate unification and 
commemorate the 37th anniversary of a failed attempt by east german 
workers to overthrow soviet rule 
with chancellor helmut kohl and other top west german officials 
in the hall to mark the anniversary lawmakers from the german 
social union proposed the final question of german unification be 
placed on the agenda 
the parliament would like to decide resolve to join the 
german democratic republic to the federal republic of germany 
on this very day lawmaker hansguenther schwarz of the german 
social union told the chamber 
lawmakers voted 26792 with seven abstentions to take up the 
issue 
but when debate opened east german prime minister lothar de 
maiziere took the microphone and said he would not support the 
measure because of the many questions that need to be addresed 
before the two germanys are united 
de maiziere also referred to the june 17 1953 uprising in 
which an estimated 300 people were killed as one of the earliest 
attempts to unify a nation cut in two by world war ii 
he portrayed the parliaments action more as a message to the 
world as the way german unity will take place 
it appears therefore on this day good and right to clearly 
acknowledge german unity and to describe the way that this will be 
done he said in remarks that were greeted with a standing 
ovation 
lawmakers then voted by an overwhelming show of hands to 
postpone the vote on unification which is likely to come in the 
months ahead 
the two german states are to merge their economies july 2 when 
the west german mark becomes the currency of east germany 
banks stayed open through the weekend and hundreds stood in 
lines opening accounts and filling out forms so their money can be 
changed to west german marks 
but the two nations still must find ways to merge their vastly 
different legal economic and social systems and resolve the key 
question of the strategic future of a united germany 
the superpowers are to hold talks in east berlin on thursday on 
the worldwide implications of german unity the united states 
insists that it be a part of nato while the soviet union is 
staunchly opposed 
east germany also is expected to face high unemployment as it 
moves to a free market and its aging enterprises are forced to 
compete 
the question that lawmakers voted to put on the agenda for 
discussion was whether to support article 23 of the west german 
constitution a method under which the entire country could 
dissolve itself and become a part of west germany 
the article was written after world war ii to allow individual 
sections of disputed german territory to decide whether to become a 
part of postwar west germany 
kohl and de maiziere both have supported the article as the 
constitutional tool under which east germany could most quickly 
unite with the west 
another method favored by other officials would involve both 
countries dissolving themselves and writing a new constitution to 
form a completely new nation which would take considerably longer 
however when unification comes it will likely occur when east 
german lawmakers vote in favor of article 23 
de maizieres christian democratic union finished an 
overwhelming first in east germanys first free elections on march 
18 by promising to support article 23 
but an actual vote on it was not expected for months after the 
economic union of the two nations takes place on july 2 
the original purpose of sundays parliamentary session was to 
debate changes in the east german constitution that would make it 
easier for the two nations to merge their vastly different social 
structures 
however a broadbased group of leftleaning lawmakers proposed 
that east germany merely adopt the laws of west germany by annexing 
itself to west germany via article 23 
the lawmakers dropped the proposal after consultations with 
their parties but the german social union then came in with its 
own similar proposal

americas mayors sunday gave initial approval to 
a broad costly domestic agenda that asks congress to repeal the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law and cut social security taxes 
for nearly 120 million workers 
the more than 70 resolutions approved by the us conference of 
mayors key policy committee contain repeated pleas for a 
multibilliondollar infusion of federal funds for antidrug 
housing education and antipoverty programs 
also endorsed was a resolution asking washington to give cities 
broad powers to regulate billboards alongside federal roads but 
the panel balked at a proposal that would have put the mayors on 
record as opposing alcohol and tobacco advertising 
the resolutions endorsed sunday will go before the full 
conference of more than 200 mayors wednesday but the panels 
decisions are rarely changed significantly in those votes which 
set the lobbying agenda for the organizations washington staff 
the mayors who have spent much of the first three days of their 
sixday annual meeting criticizing the federal government for 
slashing aid to cities said repealing grammrudman would force 
lawmakers to confront the deficit 
too many of our members of congress are using this as a crutch 
to hide some of the true problems of our economy said mayor paul 
soglin of madison wis a series of budget gimmicks have been 
implemented 
under grammrudman automatic spending cuts take effect if 
congress and the white house do not meet specified deficit 
reduction targets the mayors complained that citylevel services 
are the first to feel the automatic cuts 
it has the effect of putting cities and towns urban programs 
first on the chopping block said mayor john k bullard of new 
bedford mass 
conference staff said the mayors group if the full conference 
endorses the proposal as expected would be the first organization 
of elected officials to call for repeal of grammrudman several 
mayors said the organization likely will face criticism for its 
stance because grammrudman is the only mandatory deficitreduction 
mechanism 
the mayors across this nation have got to say this is a 
charade said mayor lee robinson of macon ga weve got to say 
enough is enough 
in calling for the social security payroll tax to be cut from 
765 percent to 671 percent the mayors panel also called on 
congress to remove the cap on outside earnings of social security 
recipients and stop using the balance in the social security trust 
fund to mask the true size of the federal deficit 
also included in one taxrelated resolution approved sunday was 
a statement opposing a capital gains tax cut favored by president 
bush 
throughout this years meeting bigcity mayors have been urging 
their colleagues to be more militant in their lobbying of 
washington and to lay claim to a good chunk of expected defense 
savings by warning that urban tensions are reaching a boiling point 
because of cashpoor antipoverty programs 
the first resolution dealing with billboards passed with little 
discussion 
it called on congress to transfer to the states the power to 
regulate and remove billboards alongside federal highways 
but the proposal to put the mayors on the record in favor of a 
ban on alcohol and drug advertising was derailed a day after it was 
endorsed by a lowerlevel committee as part of a minorityhealth 
initiative 
support for the measure eroded sunday after the measure was 
amended to oppose all alcohol and tobacco ads it intially had 
sought a ban only on outdoor ads 
also scuttled sunday was a bid by some mayors to call for a 
constitutional amendment that cities receive a fair and fixed 
percentage of federal revenues if congress refuses to pass a law 
mandating the revenue sharing 
that idea had sparked a split satuday between conference 
committees on human development and urban economic policy with the 
latter group prevailing in getting the amendment language deleted

chancellor helmut kohl has been 
pushing harder than anyone for german unity but even his 
government seemed stunned sunday by east german debate on an 
immediate merger with west germany 
this has caught everyone by surprise no one expected this 
said a west german government spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the east german parliament overwhelmingly voted to take up the 
merger issue but then decided to postpone a final vote 
kohl who attended the remarkable session to commemorate the 
37th anniversary of a failed east german uprising against communist 
rule has been the chief architect of the german unity process 
he announced a 10point program in november that laid the 
foundations for unity and he orchestrated the coming july 2 
economic merger more recently he has been pushing for the 
election of a single german government as early as december 
but not even kohl had predicted east germany might consider 
annexing itself to his country so soon 
kohl has clearly stated he wants formal unity to occur this 
year however he has cautiously avoided making it look like he is 
trying make decisions for the east german government 
during the past two weeks every time kohl has been asked when 
allgerman elections might occur he has said thats also a 
question the east german government must decide 
last week he was pointing out that his government has not even 
begun formal talks with east berlin about the possibility of 
joining the two nations under article 23 of the west german 
constitution 
most certainly we will have to talk about these questions 
what arises from article 23 and about an election date kohl said 
tuesday 
if the east german parliament had approved article 23 the 
country would have automatically joined west germany 
kohls government has been examining two possible models for 
unification allgerman elections as early as december with a 
simultaneous merger of the two countries or annexation of east 
germany under article 23 with allgerman elections at some later 
date 
east germany has not expressed an official view about either of 
these options and kohls government apparently has not decided 
which one it favors 
immediate unity could also anger the soviet union which has 
380000 troops on east german soil and does not want to pull them 
back until it can build adequate housing and find jobs for the 
soldiers 
also moscow objects to a western proposal that a united germany 
be a member of nato 
a hasty annexation of east germany while the military allegiance 
question is still in dispute would probably create further soviet 
concerns 
kohl has told the soviets many times he wants domestic as well 
as global complications of unification cleared up as soon as 
possible

the constitutional article at the core 
of east germanys stunning consideration sunday to immediately join 
west germany has existed since the founding of separate german 
states in 1949 
article 23 was always viewed as a means toward eventual 
reunification of the german people although that seemed only a 
remote possibility more than 40 years ago 
in east berlin on sunday the east german parliament 
overwhelmingly voted to consider the provision but then put off a 
vote 
under the article a region must simply vote to dissolve and 
join west germany to become part of the country with west 
germanys constitution and laws prevailing 
article 23 was written with the approval of the three 
victorious world war ii western allies the united states britain 
and france to allow individual sections of disputed german 
territory to decide whether to become a part of postwar west 
germany 
east german prime minister lothar de maizieres christian 
democratic union finished an overwhelming first in east germanys 
first free elections in march by promising to support article 23 
as translated into english article 23 reads 
this basic law constitution applies first of all in the 
regions of the states of bavaria bremen greater berlin hamburg 
hessen lower saxony north rhein westphalia rheinland palatinate 
schleswig holstein wuerttembergbaden and 
wuerttemberghohenzollern in other parts of germany it is to

one 5000 winner in the state lottery lost 
the entire prize for being behind in child support payments and 
two others lost part of their winnings state officials say 
since 1987 a state law passed when the lottery was created has 
cost three winners nearly 7000 lottery officials said last week 
deb mortenson public information director for the state lottery 
commission said last week that she cant release the names of the 
winners who were penalized but she did give some details 
in addition to the 5000 winner who lost it all a 7000 
winner lost 460 and a 4000 winner lost 721 the state 
department of social services passed the money on to the families 
the lottery which features scratchoff tickets began in 
september 1987 generally speaking the top prize in the 
scratchoff game is 10000 or less 
a provision in state law approved with the lottery authorization 
allows the deductions it applies only to winners of 100 or more 
who have court judgments against them 
the lottery automatically checks records in the social services 
department to compare the names of big prize winners against a list 
of names and social security numbers people who were overpaid for 
food stamps or aid to dependent children programs are on the list 
too said social services secretary jim ellenbecker 
the only three weve had so far were for delinquent child 
support mortenson said and the only reason people are on that 
computer file is that they have a court order against them 
other states collect those debts through their state income tax 
programs ellenbecker said since south dakota doesnt have a state 
income tax the lottery is just another way of getting that money 
when the lottery legislation was passed somebody had the 
foresight to tack that on ellenbecker said 
the amount garnished so far however is small compared with the 
40 million in delinquent support payments ellenbecker said the 
state is trying to collect some of that goes back a number of 
years

a peregrine falcon chick that became 
an instant cable tv star at hatching five weeks ago had viewers 
panicking when he disappeared from his nest on the 21st floor of a 
downtown skyscraper 
the momenttomoment activities of the chick and his brother 
have been the subject of 24hour cablecast here since they hatched 
in early may their mother and father also are part of the show 
the camera has caught each stage of the chicks progress as they 
quickly grew to almost their parents size and started to test 
their wings and venture from their nest on a ledge of the monarch 
place office tower 
but viewers delight turned to worry saturday when one chick 
disappeared 
it later turned out that the chick apparently on his first 
flight strayed too far from home and could not make it back 
he eventually landed in the middle of a downtown intersection 
amidst motorists and hundreds of pedestrians attending an outdoor 
food festival 
he was pretty stressed out there were hundreds of people 
there said steve harris a veterinarian who happened to pass by 
he was panting a bit which falcons do but he didnt fight us 
much he didnt know enough to fight 
harris took the chick to the rowley memorial animal hospital 
where he was pronounced in good health on sunday state wildlife 
officials returned him to a patio several stories above his nest 
to avoid having a human climb the glasssided building and face 
wrathful falcon parents 
harris said the parents probably would find their prodigal son 
on the patio and feed him but his homecoming would likely be 
shortlived 
hell probably try flying again in a few days anyway harris 
said this time hell probably be more successful 
the growing chicks lately had been straying beyond the cameras 
view more and more but when the bird was out of sight for several 
hours worried viewers started calling the cable company 
people get very caught up in this said brian lambert 
general manager of continental cablevision which he said is seen 
in about 100000 homes 
the chicks are the second pair raised on the ledge in this city 
of about 152000 people last year the same parent falcons chose 
that spot to raise the first two chicks in 50 years to be hatched 
in western massachusetts

in the good old days just about every 
american town had its own brass band during the firstever great 
american brass band festival which ended sunday this 
southcentral kentucky town was lucky enough to have eight oldtime 
ensembles 
it was a real coup for danville and i hope its done every 
year said steele gregory a danville businessman 
activities at the centre college campus in town began thursday 
they ranged from displays of antique bicycles to a hotair balloon 
race a traveling cartoon art exhibit from the smithsonian 
institution in washington dc an oldfashioned picnic and even a 
civil war battle reenactment 
but the highlight of the weekend was of course the music 
the groups spanned styles and periods with the civil warera 
regiment band of the 11th north carolina troops playing opposite 
danvilles advocate brass band vintage 1890 
other ensembles included saxtons cornet band from lexington 
the commonwealth brass band from louisville and the brass band of 
columbus from ohio 
but the olympia brass band from new orleans came the farthest 
and got the biggest response when the group led a procession down 
main street on saturday to the tune of when the saints come 
marching in some spectators fell in behind and danced along 
milton batiste one of the band members said afterward that it 
wasnt necessary to go to new orleans to capture that atmosphere 
the atmosphere of this music can be experienced in danville 
ky or new orleans la just the same providing people enjoy 
it said milton batiste one of the band members if people 
enjoy what we do the atmosphere is right anywhere we play 
organizers estimated that more than 10000 people turned out for 
saturdays parade and concert series danville police chief mike 
lamb estimated that several thousand attended an openair musical 
church service sunday morning

in a preview of a key national congress communist 
party members from the nations biggest republic are holding their 
own meeting this week it is likely to turn into a battleground 
over the future of communism and the country under mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the congress opening tuesday is likely to found a communist 
party of russia distinct from the national party previously 
russian republic communists have been folded into the national 
organization 
while russias popularly elected congress elected reformer boris 
n yeltsin president of the republic and declared sovereignty for 
the republic itself the republics party members seem to have 
little such independent feeling 
yet the same disputes over economic and social policies and the 
partys future that are tearing at national party unity will be 
present at the meeting of the 2700 russian communists 
russia with more than half of the soviet population and 
threequarters of its territory is home to 58 percent of the 
countrys more than 18 million communist party members 
but since the bolshevik revolution of 1917 russias identity 
largely has been submerged in the trappings of soviet socialism 
even though each of the other soviet republics has had its own 
party organization within the national party russia has not 
largely because russians had tended to dominate the national and 
republic communist parties 
its search for an identity has now taken it in the direction of 
founding its own communist party as well as in the direction of 
yeltsins more radical reforms 
conservatives radical reformers and the party leaders 
understand that the russian partys size makes it vital 
the 2700 party members from the russian republic are the same 
group that will represent it when the soviet communist party opens 
its 28th national congress on july 2 
the daily moskovsky komsomolets called this weeks conference a 
general rehearsal for the congress of 4700 party members from 
throughout the soviet union 
many party members and observers believe the national congress 
will result in the first split in the party since lenin 
at a meeting june 910 in leningrad some members called for 
gorbachev and his chief party adviser alexander n yakovlev to be 
thrown out of the party the daily komsomolskaya pravda reported 
thursday 
the leningrad group says it represents at least 15 million 
party members it has proposed its own platform and its own slate 
for the central committee 
gorbachevs communist party has to take responsibility for the 
results of perestroika viktor tyurkin a 39yearold leningrad 
party leader said in an interview it is not oriented to the 
majority of simple working people 
like several generations of communists before them tyurkin and 
his comrades believe that soviet socialism has protected working 
people from the whims of the market while reformers criticize 
gorbachevs economic program for timidity in a time of crisis the 
leningrad group sees in them a breach of faith 
despite the leningrad groups criticism of gorbachev there is a 
strong possibility that it will form an alliance with the national 
party leadership at the conference said vladimir lysenko a leader 
of the reformminded democratic platform 
a few months ago gorbachev spoke out against the founding of 
the russian party before the national party congress but he now 
favors it lysenko told the moskovsky komsomolets newspaper the 
leningrad group also favors it 
representatives of the leningrad meetings have been invited to 
help write the conference documents but no members of democratic 
platform have been invited lysenko said 
democratic platform is preparing its own set of documents that 
its small group of delegates will present at the conference he 
said 
vladimir komarov a spokesman for the leningrad group said it 
will have at least 25 delegates to the national conference members 
of the democratic platform say they expect to have a small group as 
well 
soviet party leaders have given no indication so far what 
direction they think the party should take 
vyacheslav shostakovsky another democratic platform leader 
said that even though organizers of the leningrad meetings do not 
have any influential nationwide leaders they can reach a large 
number of russians frustrated by the failures of reform 
by such appeals a bloc can be formed that can create a rather 
potent threat to political stability he said

rival factions of the guerrilla group led 
by terrorist mastermind abu nidal battled sunday with machine guns 
and rocketpropelled grenades killing at least four people and 
wounding 15 police said 
the showdown was the bloodiest in lebanon between the two 
factions since an antiabu nidal mutiny within his 
fatahrevolutionary council began three years ago 
the fighting broke out around midnight in the narrow alleyways 
of the rashidiyeh refugee camp and continued until 9 am when 
fighters loyal to yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction of the 
plo intervened 
police and palestinian sources said supporters and opponents of 
abu nidal from within his fatahrevolutionary council fought in the 
narrow alleys of the shantytown using mortars machine guns and 
rocketpropelled grenades 
rashidiyeh 50 miles south of beirut houses 18500 palestinians 
registered by the un relief and works agency in addition to a 
few thousand unregistered refugees 
the police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
abu nidals opponents backed by fighters from arafats fatah 
occupied a school run by the un agency 
the threestory building overlooks the main position of abu 
nidals loyalists 
the opponents demanded that abu nidals supporters surrender or 
risk being dislodged by force the sources said 
forty men surrendered after the mediation of representatives 
from other plo factions the fatahrevolutionary council is outside 
the palestine liberation organization which comprises nine 
factions 
the fighting flared up after saturdays assassination in 
rashidiyeh of omar hamadeh regional commander of the 
fatahrevolutionary council his bodyguard mohammed meri was 
wounded his attacker is unknown 
arafats fatah and the fatahrevolutionary council of abu nidal 
whose real name is sabri albanna are also engaged in a bitter 
feud 
plo officials and opponents said in 1987 that abu nidal had 22 
close aides gunned down in libya in the internal policy dispute 
abu nidal is believed to be in libya despite reports that 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi was seeking his ouster in order 
to distance himself from international terrorism 
a us state department report last year described abu nidal as 
the worlds most dangerous terrorist 
it blamed his group for 34 terrorist attacks in 20 countries 
since he split from the plo in 1973 at least 900 people were 
killed or wounded in these attacks the report said

muhammad ershad 
the oppositionsponsored protest shut down schools businesses 
and transportation in at least 21 major cities including the 
capital dhaka a city of 6 million

but there were no reports of violence 
in dhaka thousands of marchers shouted down with ershad 
as riot police patrolled nearby

fresh taxes proposed by his government said sheikh hasina 
leader of an alliance of eight parties that called the strike

that new taxes would be introduced 
munim said increased taxes were essential to raise funds for 
development programs 
bangladesh with a population of 111 million is one of the 
poorest countries in the world with a per capita income of 160 a 
year 
opposition leaders have labeled the proposed increases 
antipeople and have demanded that the government resign and 
order new elections under a neutral caretaker government 
the opposition also accused ershad a former army general of 
rigging presidential and parliamentary elections to retain power 
ershads jatiya or peoples party holds a twothirds majority in 
parliament but leading opposition parties boycotted the last 
elections in 1988 
ershad took power in a bloodless coup in 1982

anticommunist demonstrators sunday 
returned to a main square where police and miners loyal to 
president ion iliescu beat people to put down protests last week 
down with iliescu iliescu should be put on trial about 
100 protesters yelled 
soldiers armed with clubs looked on but they took no immediate 
action to disperse them 
the small group of demonstrators thinned out by midnight after 
interior minister doru viorel ursu offered to open a dialogue with 
the protesters ursu was appointed thursday after his predecessor 
was forced to step down partly because of the brutal way in which 
police broke up the previous demonstration in the square 
we are waiting for dialogue with you and we are ready to meet 
you wherever you want said the interior ministry communique 
published by the state rompres news agency we are convinced we 
can live in harmony 
the demonstrators earlier sunday issued a list of demands 
including the release of all those arrested over the past week in 
connection with the protest and subsequent rioting and the 
publication of a list of people still hospitalized as a result of 
the violence 
the government says 1021 people were arrested in last weeks 
protests there were no reports that miners were among those 
arrested 
the government having lost badly needed aid from the united 
states and western europe because of the recent repression 
promised to uphold democratic principles in a statement published 
sunday 
opposition leaders say the government of iliescu whose national 
salvation front won last months free elections by a landslide is 
dominated by excommunists from the regime of deposed dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
iliescu is to be inaugurated later this week 
in timisoara about 3000 people gathered sunday on a central 
square for a service to remember 94 people killed in the western 
city in december the uprising grew into the bloody revolution that 
overthrew ceausescu 
the service was peaceful 
scores of demonstrators appeared in bucharest on sunday evening 
at university square the site of a 53day protest demanding that 
iliescu and other excommunists be banned from office 
riot police broke up the demonstration wednesday the start of 
three days of unrest in which six people died and 502 were injured 
iliescu called on thousands of coal miners to maintain order 
and they swarmed bucharest on thursday and friday swinging iron 
bars and cudgels they attacked anyone they suspected as 
antigovernment 
the violence ended after iliescu thanked the miners with all 
my heart and ordered them home late friday 
on sunday about 80 troops equipped with submachine guns and 
nightsticks stood on the periphery of university square but did not 
interfere two buses full of police were parked nearby 
opposition leaders said the government was behaving like the 
dictatorship it replaced 
in a statement published in sundays newspapers the government 
pledged to play by democratic rules 
the government is prepared to assure appropriate measures for 
freedom of political expression for all with the exception of acts 
of instigation and of neofascist propaganda he statement said 
it also demands that those responsible ensure the total 
freedom of operation of the democratic institutions of the press 
radio and television and instill firmly democratic institutions 
in our country it added 
the statement appeared to be an attempt to contain damage to 
romanias image abroad and to quiet domestic critics particularly 
worried by the miners attacks on intellectuals 
miners smashed the headquarters of opposition parties ransacked 
the home of at least one opposition leader and ordered four 
opposition dailies and periodicals to stop publishing 
the newspapers have not reappeared raising fears that 
opposition voices will not be heard in a society dominated by 
iliescu and his national salvation front 
western governments and international human rights organizations 
condemned the violence of the miners 
state department spokesman richard boucher said the united 
states would withhold all but humanitarian aid and the european 
community postponed a trade and economic cooperation agreement with 
romania

the new rightwing cabinet on sunday gave 
former generals ariel sharon and rafael eitan their biggest say in 
military policy since both were reprimanded for actions in two 
massacres during the 1982 lebanon invasion 
at its first meeting the cabinet named sharon a former defense 
minister and eitan chief of staff during the lebanon invasion to 
the 11man ministerial defense committee 
the committee is a forum for debating defense policies and also 
includes one representative of each of likuds government coalition 
allies 
sharon and eitan were blamed by an israeli inquiry for not 
anticipating that israels lebanese christian militia allies would 
massacre hundreds of palestinians if they were allowed to enter 
beiruts sabra and chatilla refugee camps in 1982 
sharon a leader of the conservative likud bloc also was named 
chairman of a cabinet committee overseeing the immigration of 
thousands of soviet jews to israel sharon is an advocate of jewish 
settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
his appointment has raised fears that he would try to move 
soviet jews to the occupied areas worsening already tense ties 
with the united states us officials consider the jewish 
settlements obstacles to peace 
israeli officials insisted sunday that the new cabinet would 
work for peace with palestinians and for a smoother relationship 
with the united states 
defense minister moshe arens said he wants to improve the 
level and scope of dialogue between myself as defense minister and 
the arab palestinian population in the area so that together we 
try to find the basis of an agreement 
i know it would be limited and i know we dont agree about 
many things but what is important here is the very fact of a 
dialogue arens said on israel televisions arabiclanguage 
program 
police minister roni milo a likud member and confidant of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said this government is interested in 
the peace process no less than the preceding government 
likuds coalition government with the leftcenter labor party 
fell apart in march because shamir would not go along with labor 
demands to accept a us proposal for preliminary 
palestinianisraeli peace talks the new rightwing government took 
power last week 
milo said he expected talks soon between us and israeli 
officials to advance the peace process 
he also warned however that the new government would not 
accept previous processes that were not brought up nicely a 
reference to secretary of states james a baker iiis efforts to 
organize an israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo egypt 
baker urged including at least one palestinian deported by 
israel as a way to satisfy palestine liberation organization 
demands that palestinians living outside the occupied lands be 
included he also proposed to include some arabs who have homes 
both in the annexed east jerusalem and in the occupied areas 
israel argued such moves would allow the plo to control the 
palestinian delegation and raise the issue of jerusalem which 
israel has declared its eternal capital 
the new defense committee named by the cabinet will be headed by 
shamir 74 a former agent of the mossad secret service the 
committee also includes arens and foreign minister david levy 
sharon 62 a hero in the 1967 and 1973 middle east wars was 
the architect of the lebanon invasion he was forced to resign as 
defense minister after the sabra and chatilla massacre in west 
beirut 
israeliallied lebanese christian militiamen who were bitter 
over the murder of their leader went into the two refugee camps 
the day after israels army seized control of west beirut they 
killed more than 800 palestinians many of them women and children 
an israeli inquiry found that sharon disregarded the danger of 
acts of venegance in allowing the christian fighters into the 
camps it found that eitan failed to investigate reports of a 
massacre and did not act to stop it 
sharon has repeatedly said he wants the defense ministers post 
back but he has been kept in lesser cabinet jobs 
eitan 61 a member of the farright tzomet party has never 
been in the cabinet

vietnamese counterintelligence agents 
have uncovered five antigovernment rings and arrested dozens of 
members after investigating joint ventures with foreign companies 
an official report said 
the saturday broadcast a text of which was seen in bangkok on 
sunday was one of a series of recent announcements indicating a 
crackdown on dissent in the communist southeast asian country 
hanoi radio said the groups were discovered when security 
services investigated more than 100 companies involved in the joint 
ventures with foreign companies 
the radio said the investigation was part of a drive is intended 
to root out people regarded as dangerous to national security 
the crackdown spearheaded by the interior ministry has 
included arrests increased police surveillance and the deportation 
of two americans for alleged antigovernment activity 
the broadcast said that in their inspection of the companies 
security forces had discovered many spies who have taken 
advantage of various international organizations and corporations 
that have investments in vietnam to infiltrate into the country to 
carry out intelligence activities 
the security forces have destroyed five underground 
reactionary organizations and captured tens of their members the 
broadcast said 
it said many documents books magazines and other publications 
with reactionary contents had been confiscated 
the broadcast did not elaborate on the alleged spy and 
antigovernment groups it did not identify those arrested 
in the past hanoi has charged that the cia and vietnamese 
expatriates have tried to destabilize the communist government 
some vietnamese officials said the crackdown was ordered to 
prevent protests during several anniversaries earlier this year 
these included the 15th anniversary of the communists victory over 
south vietnam 
but western analysts said they believe there is also a sense of 
insecurity among hardline older communist leaders who fear the 
country is being isolated by the fall of communist governments 
around the world 
vietnam is one of a dwindling number of nations where the 
communist party rules without sharing power

oileating microbes spread over part of 
an oil slick from the supertanker mega borg appear to have done 
their job but officials said they launched another experiment 
sunday to make sure 
on friday about 100 pounds of hungry bacteria were spread over 
an acre of the slick from the crippled norwegian tanker that 
exploded june 8 in the gulf of mexico 
it was the first use of the process called bioremediation on 
open waters 
a flyover sunday of the area marked by a buoy showed little oil 
in the treated waters state officials said 
there certainly wasnt any oil over there said texas water 
commission chairman bj buck wynne 
however wynne said it could not be determined if the oil was 
removed by the microbes or currents or whether the buoy had moved 
visually it appeared there was hardly anything left it 
appears degradation of the oil has occurred said blanton moore 
of the texas general land office 
moore said officials wont know for certain from the first 
application so they started another experiment sunday by 
encircling two areas of the slick with booms each 15 feet in 
diameter 
officials plan to spread microbes on one area but do nothing 
with the other moore said water samples will be taken from both 
areas and results should be available early in the week 
carl oppenheimer a university of texas microbiologist who has 
been working on bioremediation for 15 years has predicted the 
experiment will succeed and show that the process should be used on 
a wider scale in oil spills 
bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria to break down 
oil into harmless fatty acids eaten by marine life

excommunists appeared on the way toward 
winning a parliamentary majority in runoff elections sunday it 
would be the first victory for a reformed communist party in the 
recent east bloc elections 
however the 400seat unicameral parliament the first freely 
elected legislature in bulgaria in 58 years will have a 
substantial number of opposition lawmakers and their presence will 
mark the end of rubberstamp approval for policies of the former 
communists 
the bulgarian capital sofia appeared to be firmly in 
opposition hands 
the projections of a victory for the former communists who now 
call themselves socialists was based in part on incomplete 
results from about 30 of the 81 constituencies counted by the 
independent association for fair elections 
the group did not release a total figure for how many seats it 
believed the former communists captured but it said preliminary 
numbers indicated they had won an overall majority 
firstround results show that in 22 of the 81 constituencies in 
sundays runoff the excommunists candidates had a substantial 
lead over their rivals and in 33 others they had a slight edge 
apart from bulgaria noncommunist parties have triumphed in 
this years round of national elections in east germany 
czechoslovakia hungary and romania after last years democratic 
revolutions however in romania a party with former communists in 
its leadership won elections last month 
although sundays voting appeared to go smoothly in most places

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki said 
sunday that calls by solidarity members to accelerate reforms 
jeopardize government efforts to institute democratic changes 
mazowiecki was speaking to leaders of citizens committees the 
political arm that solidarity formed last year to contest 
elections as they met in warsaw to debate future strategy 
those who use attacks poison and hatred make holes in our 
common boat of polish democracy mazowiecki said 
only by common effort and only by understanding that one has 
to build the fundamentals of polish democracy will we be able to go 
through this difficult passage from the old to the new system he 
added 
mazowiecki a catholic intellectual and longtime adviser to 
solidarity leader lech walesa said the citizens committees should 
act in partnership with other groups to build democracy in poland 
mazowiecki took over as head of polands solidarityled 
government in august ending 40 years of monopoly rule by the 
communist party 
however he has come under increasing attack by walesa and 
members of parliament for being too slow and too timid in routing 
out communist bureaucrats 
walesa has also attempted to bring new people who back his views 
into solidaritys national committee 
those efforts have aroused concern among intellectuals who 
believe walesas new set of advisers are more interested in seeing 
the solidarity leader elected president than in rebuilding 
democracy 
walesa did not attend sundays meeting but sent a letter that 
was read before the delegates 
we are passing today from one system to another the old 
system we fought against has been overthrown a new political 
system is only being formed it should be formed as quickly as 
possible more energetically the labor leader wrote in his 
letter

gunmen have killed 12 more people in the 
violencewracked drug capital of medellin and police said sunday 
they have captured another suspected drug trafficker wanted in the 
united states 
the 10monthold war between the government and traffickers 
heated up again last week when police shot and killed the man they 
described as the mastermind of the drug lords campaign of terror 
and a car bomb killed four people 
the trafficking suspect salomon sheuter benitez was captured 
friday in the coastal city of barranquilla a police communique 
said 
the communique said sheuter 49 is wanted in pittsburgh on 
charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine he is one of 15 
colombians currently awaiting extradition to the united states 
bill dempsey a spokesman for the us marshal service in 
washington said the person arrested apparently is the same one 
listed on a dec 14 1987 cocaine possession and distribution 
warrant from pittsburgh in a state case 
there was no immediate confirmation of the arrest or details 
from other us officials sheuter is not on the official us list 
of the 12 colombian drug suspects most wanted for extradition 
four more police and two soldiers were shot and killed by 
terrorists in medellin on saturday a police communique said 
without elaborating 
officials were quoted sunday by a newspaper as saying married 
policemen will be transferred out of the city police have said the 
medellin cartel is paying more than 4000 to terrorists for every 
police officer they kill 
a terrorist campaign blamed on the citys cocaine cartel has 
killed 116 police officers this year in the city 150 miles 
northwest of the capital bogota 
in addition a gunmen killed six civilians including two 
16yearold girls in a restaurant in one of medellins poor 
neighborhoods police reported they gave no details 
however the massacre was similar to several recently carried 
out by unidentified gunmen in neighborhoods known as the recruiting 
grounds for the medellin cartel 
in a communique last week the cartel blamed police for the 
killings of the neighborhoods youths police rejected the charge 
saying the massacres were apparently the work of rival criminal 
gangs 
the colombian government has extradited 15 colombians since 
putting the policy into effect in august the last extradition was 
march 29 
several us and colombian officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity have said the policy has been suspended until the 
presidentelect cesar gaviria takes office on aug 7 
the administration of president virgilio barco has not commented 
on whether the policy has been suspended 
traffickers have retaliated for the governments antidrug 
campaign with a wave of terrorist attacks that have left hundreds 
of colombians dead since the war began in august with the 
traffickers assassination of a leading presidential hopeful 
the government has offered over 400000 for information leading 
to the capture of the alleged chief of the medellin cartel pablo 
escobar 
on wednesday police raided the medellin apartment of the 
cartels military chief john jairo arias and killed him after he 
fired on them according to the official report 
hours later a car bomb exploded near a police post in the same 
neighborhood it killed four people including two suspected 
terrorists inside the car and injured 43 others police said

to land at kennedy airport officials had cleared the airport to 
accept more airplanes an hour than a traffic control supervisor 
recommended a newsaper reported sunday

holding patterns for more than an hour while flying up the east

donald trump who turned 44 the day 
before he failed to make a critical debt payment told casino 
workers throwing him a huge birthday bash that hes not washed up 
in the business world 
nobody wants to write the positives trump told about 1000 
cheering employees at his taj mahal casino resort on saturday 
over the years ive surprised a lot of people the largest 
surprise is yet to come 
trump who turned 44 on thursday did not specifically mention 
his failure friday to make an estimated 31 million bond payment on 
his trump castle casinoresort but criticized news reporters for 
focusing on his financial woes 
news about his debt crunch overshadowed any coverage of gaming 
revenues produced last month by the taj mahal which set a citywide 
record he said 
trump arrived by limousine flanked by body guards and did not 
speak with reporters before climbing onto a stage fronting the 
atlantic ocean 
for his birthday trump received a chocolate cupcake with a pink 
candle and an 8footby10foot portrait of himself 
those looking for reports in the taj mahal of trumps money 
troubles were disappointed any newspaper with headlines about 
trumps problems was not for sale inside 
outside newspaper stands on the boardwalk near the stage were 
stocked with new york city papers headlined donald duck and 
jilted by lady luck under foggy skies and surrounded by 
birthday cards signed by the 13000 employees at his three casinos 
trump thanked workers for their loyalty calling them absolutely 
fantastic 
the manhattan real estate mogul who also owns the trump plaza 
hotel and casino in atlantic city left without speaking with 
reporters 
before he arrived at least a dozen workers told the crowd that 
trump would weather his problems and they thanked him for providing 
jobs the speeches of support punctuated performances by gyrating 
belly dancers standup comedians and a fivepiece band 
donna long a 26yearold craps table worker at trump plaza 
said the rally inspired her 
i feel like this business has its ups and downs she said 
my boss is a strong man 
trump missed a payment friday on junk bonds used to finance 
trump castle and was given a 10day grace period to make the 
payment 
for the first quarter this year trump castle posted a loss of 
84 million the largest loss among the citys 12 casinos 
after the taj mahal opened in april trump castles gross gaming 
revenue declined 123 percent in may it fell 173 percent 
compared to 1989 despite those losses the casino was up 06 
percent in gross gaming revenues for januarymay compared to the 
first five months of 1989

frank orloski didnt believe he was 
taking a stand in the debate over whether to eliminate the penny 
but when he looked at the pricing policy of his 36 quik mart 
convenience stores and service stations he realized he had already 
put his two cents in 
in most circumstances our prices either end with a nine or a 
five or a zero orloski said last week when we price most of 
our merchandise we either make it so customers get just one penny 
back or none so i guess subconsciously we do take a stand 
the senate banking committee on wednesday will hear from 
economists and retailers on whether the united states should 
continue minting a 1cent piece if the bill becomes law cash 
transactions would be rounded to the nearest nickel 
jim benfield a spokesman for a collection of groups whose main 
goal is a workable dollar coin points to people like orloski in 
illustrating the short shrift the penny gets and deserves 
fortythree percent of all coins required for small 
transactions are pennies said benfield a spokesman for the 
washingtonbased coin coalition the figure is based on the minimum 
number of coins needed to make every change combination from 1 to 
99 cents 
members of the coin coalition contend the united states loses 
22 million a year in making change the figure is based on 10 
billion cash transactions yearly and a cashier wasting two seconds 
per transaction fishing for pennies 
that adds up to 20 billion seconds or 55 million hours at 4 
an hour for the average clerk the total loss comes to 22 million 
also if the penny were eliminated cash register drawers would 
have room for the dollar coins the coin coalition backs 
to help his customers orloski has small containers of pennies 
at the cash registers of half his northeastern pennsylvania stores 
a trend started by tobacco companies in the 1980s as 
pointofpurchase advertising 
if people dont have exact change theyre encouraged to dip in 
if they have extra change on a future trip theyre encouraged to 
return the favor 
theyre used it makes it easier for everyone said orloski 
of wilkesbarre 
raymond lombra a penn state economist who like benfield will 
testify before the banking committee defends the penny 
the incidence of prices ending in nine or any odd digit is no 
accident lombra said to the average customer a 99cent loaf 
of bread appears to cost a lot less than a 1 loaf of bread 
any money saved on clerks wages would be offset if each adult 
had one transaction rounded up per day lombra said he said it 
would effectively impose a rounding tax of 350 per adult per 
year 
for the nations 175 million adults the cost would exceed 600 
million and with government payments tied to the consumer price 
index the rounding tax could increase government spending 15 
billion in five years lombra said 
theres more to it than getting rid of those jars of pennies 
that have accumulated in our homes he said 
the mint makes more than 10 billion pennies a year more than 
all other us coins combined eliminating the penny would 
eliminate the argument that the mint doesnt have the capacity to 
produce new dollar coins 
pennies are made primarily of zinc and the zinc industry partly 
funds the group that hired lombra to do research the new dollar 
coins would be mostly copper the copper industry backs benfields 
group
