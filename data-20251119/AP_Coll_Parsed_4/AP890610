radio talk show hosts proved theyre a force to be 
reckoned with during the congressional payraise brouhaha deluging 
capitol hill with millions of tea bags from angry listeners but 
they still feel ignored 
so theyre meeting in boston this weekend to do what other 
aggrieved minorities do unite to demand more power 
in the words of rodney dangerfield we dont get no 
respect said organizer jerry williams of boston radio station 
wrko the national media never took us very seriously they 
think theres some conspiracy here 
about 50 of the countrys 225 radio talk show hosts began 
arriving friday for the inaugural talkradio conference a twoday 
gab confab expected to include consumer activist ralph nader tv 
talk show host morton downey jr and political columnist jack 
anderson 
williams a 65yearold talk jockey whos been in the business 
since 1950 said he hoped the gathering would give visibility to a 
national movement that has given ordinary people a chance to be 
heard 
theres a huge void where people feel they dont have a voice 
anymore he said 
the voices at the conference are deep and smooth the smiles are 
big the words are vehement and wellrehearsed 
there is no more representative government in this country 
anymore its all special interests said mills crenshaw of 
wtkkam in salt lake city the reason politicians are afraid of 
talk radio is we have the ability to allow private citizens to talk 
to their government 
williams took the first step toward unifying the talk show hosts 
in february when he was able to persuade his colleagues to lead a 
national protest against proposed federal pay increases 
coaxed by their local hosts listeners sent their congressmen a 
ton of tea bags bearing the message read my tea bag no 50 
percent raise 
the public pressure helped halt a raise for lawmakers judges and 
other people on the federal payroll 
williams said he was encouraged by the cooperation of his onair 
brethren to try to formalize their connections through a conference 
the session got going friday with an open mike to boston area 
listeners today the talk show hosts planned to talk to each other 
exchanging ideas and formally organizing williams said 
faneuil hall the venerable brick building where revolutionaries 
fomented independence from britain and abolitionists railed against 
slavery served as the stage for fridays events 
in the morning wrko host gene burns leaned into one of the 
microphones and said the people are sovereign not the 
government adding 
our elected representatives try to give americans enough 
fat from the hog to keep people from rising up 
his peers from across the country and about 125 listeners from 
around new england took their seats and in person the talk show 
fans were as vociferous as their radio friends 
i like to hear what the people say and not the politicians we 
have a governor here whos a dictator said z peter czapski 67 
of north andover his face turning red 
youve got me going the retired tool and die plant manager 
said happily 
janet wofsey 36 of quincy who works for a department store 
said shes a frequent listener and talker 
its the satisfaction of voicing my opinion to express it over 
the airwaves with letter writing theres no response she said 
you can get a response from the talk show

a woman struggling to keep her 17 
million gift business alive says the states enforcement of a law 
banning sewing work at home is unfair and has cost nearly 100 women 
their jobs 
the state department of labor and industry has ordered 
overlyraker inc to stop using 100 or more homeworkers to piece 
together soft sculptures geese cows cats and other creations 
stuffed in cloth skins 
helen overly the companys president said she was unaware of 
the 1937 industrial homework act and made no effort to hide the 
companys use of women sewing at home the law prohibits anyone 
other than handicapped or those providing primary care for a 
handicapped family member from doing industrial work at home 
overly a former teacher founded the company in her basement 16 
years ago with freda raker a former secretary who handles the 
business creative end 
since the bureau of labor standards ordered the company to stop 
home production may 11 in response to a complaint overly said she 
began to hire the 30 or more seamstresses needed at a plant in a 
former dairy distribution building in southern pennsylvanias rural 
fulton county 
the biggest hassle now is to find people who will come in 
she said 
most of the women who had worked at home will lose their jobs 
because they have small children or cannot get to the plant she 
said theres a lot of hardship going on because of this 
one worker virginia logsdon said the 250 a month she earned 
supplemented her husbands income she said she worked for almost 
two years usually earning about 4 an hour based on the piece rate 
paid by overlyraker 
it was very important it takes what my husband makes to meet 
the expenses she said my money would take care of clothes the 
dentist medicines 
logsdon said she cant leave her 11yearold daughter colletta 
and 12yearold son danny to drive the more than 100 miles between 
her home in rural armstrong county to the new overlyraker plant 
helen r friedman director of the labor standards bureau said 
the state was determined to enforce labor laws we work to protect 
peoples rights she said 
john fox an international vice president for the amalgamated 
clothing and textile workers said homework provides an opportunity 
for companies to exploit workers 
there is no control there is no such thing as overtime their 
children help them before you know it children under 12 have 
become helpers fox said it becomes substandard conditions 
during a recent interview overly said the company had more than 
400 orders for more than 8000 pieces of merchandise as it prepares

for years us jews have set aside a special 
matzo each passover and prayed for the emigration of their brethren 
in the soviet union 
now that those prayers have been answered for many jews in the 
united states are being asked to set aside something more than 
unleavened bread the money required to resettle as many as 50000 
jews who are expected to leave the soviet union this year 
the united jewish appeal the national fundraising campaign for 
jewish causes in the united states and israel has launched passage 
to freedom an effort aimed at raising 75 million for soviet 
emigres this year 
half will go to resettlement activities in the united states the 
rest will be split between soviet jews in transit to the united 
states and those seeking to settle in israel 
we have worked for years and years to free them from russia 
now that they are free we cant deny them the freedom to choose 
where they are going to live said ron reider director of public 
affairs for the jewish federation council of greater los angeles 
we really dont know how long these doors will be open said 
marvin lender who is leading the national effort were looking 
at the third largest jewish community in the world and heres an 
opportunity to save them 
the campaign launched in april already has raised more than 21 
million 
peggy tishman president of new yorks ujafederation of jewish 
philanthropies said one reason for the success is that many 
american jews feel they did too little to save european jews from 
hitler 
the idea of not losing another jewish soul is allpervasive 
she said 
programs to help soviet jews have been taxed to the breaking 
point by the flood of emigres especially in new york city the 
destination for more than half of the new arrivals 
the new york association for new americans the biggest private 
resettlement agency that gets about twothirds of its money from the 
uja has had to spread its staff among three offices to make room 
for more caseworkers 
the association is operating as many as 70 english classes a day 
for immigrants it also helps new arrivals find jobs and housing 
new yorks ujafederation has taken a 100000 advance from its 
passage to freedom money to finance scholarships to jewish day camps 
so youngsters can adjust to life in the united states while their 
parents learn english get jobs and find places to live 
appeal money in other cities also will go to programs with proven 
track records 
in four to five months we can make them taxpaying members of 
the community said reider 
about 18000 soviets mostly jewish left the soviet union in the 
first five months of this year and another 26000 applicants are 
waiting to be interviewed at the us embassy 
with only about 10 percent of the soviet jewish emigres choosing 
to go to israel some zionists complain that too much money is going 
to us resettlement programs 
given the choice id rather see much more of the passage to 
freedom money go to israel said lynne abramson president of new 
yorks long island committee for soviet jewry 
still she said she has given to the appeal 
i feel that we need very much to help them when they are 
here ms abramson said

hong kong is preparing to offer asylum to political 
refugees from china londons guardian newspaper reported today 
quoting the british colonys secretary for security the paper 
said trained personnel and screening procedures have already been 
set up at the border with chinas guandong province even though 
it is recognized that this move will add to the growing tensions 
between hong kong and beijing 
the secretary geoffrey barnes was in london with hong kongs 
governor sir david wilson for talks with the british government 
in the volatile situation in china nobody can rule out that a 
mass of refugees will attempt to cross the thin wire fence that now 
divides china from the new territories the report said 
the colony consists of an island and a mainland area called the 
new territories adjoining the south of guandong province 
in beijing chinese and diplomatic sources say police have begun 
arresting intellectuals accused of encouraging the protests and 
participants in the resistance to military intervention 
the guardian said barnes stressed that so far there had been no 
requests for asylum among the daily handful of chinese who cross the 
border illegally 
it said that in the past illegal immigrants were sent back to 
china within 24 hours 
but now in the light of events in china political asylum will 
be granted and unlike the vietnamese boat people whose presence is 
causing increasing friction in hong kong chinese refugees are 
certain to be welcomed the report said 
the military assault on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing 
has hurt the hong kong economy by raising anxieties over the period 
after july 1997 when great britain is to hand the colony back to 
china under the terms of an agreement signed in 1984 
chinas upheaval already has dealt a serious blow to the hong 
kong stock exchange and badly shaken confidence in the property 
market 
officials in the colony said today they fear a drop in its annual 
43 billion tourism business as travelers cancel visits because of 
the upheaval 
about 56 million people visited hong kong last year and 28 
percent of them coupled the trip with a visit to china according to 
the hong kong tourist association 
many people now canceling tours to china also are dropping hong 
kong said manuel woo executive director of the hong kong hotels 
association

president alfredo cristiani 
blamed leftist guerrillas for the assassination of his closest 
adviser and said they were trying to provoke a reaction from his 
rightwing government 
all major political groups condemned the submachinegun killings 
of jose antonio rodriguez porth 73 and two bodyguards friday 
outside the ministers home 
president bush issued a white house statement calling the 
assassination a vicious murder and some salvadoran politicans 
warned it could lead to new political polarization in the nation 
rodriguez porth a cabinet member considered christianis chief 
of staff was the highest ranking official killed in the 9yearold 
civil war between the usbacked government and the rebels the 
rebels as of early today had not claimed responsibility for the 
shootings 
guillermo ungo a social democrat and political ally of the 
rebels said the slaying was an assasination in cold blood 
that does not contribute in any way to peaceful coexistence and 
dialogue 
cristiani called rodriguez one of the most illustrious men of 
our country and told a news conference his adminstration will not 
not allow more provocations that push our country farther down 
into the whirlpool of violence 
cristiani said his government is convinced the leftist farabundo 
marti liberation front fmln is trying to provoke a reaction from 
us but we are not going to react outside of the law 
gunmen fired on rodriguez porths car after he left his home in 
the capital he died shortly after he was taken at zaldivar 
hospital a nurse said on condition of anonymity police said the 
two bodyguards one of whom was driving the car died at the scene 
gerardo le chevallier leader of the centrist christian 
democratic party warned the assassinations could mark a new 
political polarization in the country 
he said the attack was the result of the declarations of 
cristiani that if the fmln does not accept its peace proposal there 
could be a military response 
the rebel front last week offered to halt attacks if the new 
rightwing republican nationalist alliance government eliminated 
death squads the alliance known as arena denies any involvement 
with death squads and spurned the proposal 
arena was founded in 1981 by cashiered army maj roberto 
daubuisson who has been linked to the squads that killed thousands 
of suspected leftists in the early 1980s he denies the accusations 
also among the founders was rodriguez who was a vice minister in 
the 1940s a member of the civilianmilitary junta in 1961 and 
foreign minister in 1978 
guerrillas have pledged to make the country ungovernable under 
the administration of cristiani who won a presidential election in 
march 
about 70000 people mostly civilians have died since civil war 
broke out in 1980

protesters rallied against the proposed 
forced repatriation of indochinese refugees from hong kong likening 
the move to the voyage of the damned in 1939 
they demonstrated outside the british consulate in san francisco 
on friday as officials in london urged that hong kong send home most 
vietnamese boat people 
demonstrators harkened back to the voyage of a german ship loaded 
with fleeing jews who were refused entrance to the united states 
the 900 jewish passengers aboard the ss st louis returned to 
various european ports and many later died at nazi hands the event 
was depicted in the 1975 movie voyage of the damned starring 
faye dunaway and max von sydow 
a spokesman at san franciscos british consulate said officials 
had no comment but the colonys british secretary of security 
geoffrey barnes told reporters at a london news conference that 
hong kong has had enough 
the refugee problem is creating a second crisis for the british 
colony deeply worried about coming under chinese rule in 1997 he 
said 
hong kong has 42766 vietnamese boat people onethird of whom 
arrived this year barnes said all but 14150 were simply seeking a 
better way of life rather than political refuge 
the protesters including jewish representatives democratic 
lawmakers and former vietnamese boat people carried signs that 
read princess diana dont let them butcher us or that quoted 
margaret thatcher when people are free to choose they choose to 
be free 
dr toan truong who escaped from vietnam just two days before 
the fall of saigon in april 1975 told some 50 rally participants 
that forced repatriation was something that will be perpetrated by 
bloodless bureaucrats 
this is a crime against humanity said truong who was among 
two dozen protesters who began a fiveday fast to call attention to 
their cause 
besides the british colony protesters said countries that may be 
considering repatriation include brunei malayasia indonesia 
singapore and thailand 
demonstrators called on britain to oppose repatriation and the

federal prosecutors want to guarantee they have a 
claim against the assets of former philippines president ferdinand 
e marcos even after hes dead 
to that end they filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against 
marcos and his wife imelda on friday 
the critically ill 71yearold marcos and his 59yearold wife 
are already under a criminal racketeering indictment in new york 
charged with siphoning millions of dollars from their homelands 
treasury 
the latest lawsuit filed under the civil aspects of the 
racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act closely parallels 
allegations in the 90count criminal indictment 
the civil complaint was filed in order to ensure that the 
interests of the united states as well as the interests of the 
victims of the racketeering enterprise will be fully preserved in 
the event of the death of ferdinand e marcos said us attorney 
benito romano 
assistant us attorney charles labella said the victims include 
the philippine people and numerous us banks 
the criminal charges against marcos and attending forfeiture 
claims against his alleged illgotten gains would be dismissed after 
his death romano explained conversely a civil complaint filed 
by the government against an individual defendant continues against 
the estate of a deceased defendant he said 
marcos lawyer richard a hibey in washington dc said he 
would fight the civil case as well as the criminal charges 
john j tigue a new york attorney for mrs marcos said the 
lawsuit will be defended against vigorously as is the underlying 
charge which essentially contains the same allegations 
the marcoses have lived in exile in hawaii since they were 
toppled in a popular uprising in february 1986 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the federal charges her 
husbands ill health kept him from making the trip from hawaii to 
new york for arraignment in april he was separated from the case 
although the charges were not dropped 
marcos who suffers from heart and lung ailments has been 
hospitalized in honolulus st francis medical center since jan 16 
he underwent emergency surgery for kidney failure last month 
his doctors and lawyers say he is near death 
a us grand jury indicted the marcoses and eight others last 
october on various charges racketeering charges against the 
marcoses accused them of looting more than 103 million from the 
philippines to buy art and real estate in new york city 
the indictment also said the marcoses defrauded us banks and 
lending institutions of more than 165 million in buying and 
financing the choice manhattan real estate

electricity it provides to panama if its central americans neighbor 
does not pay a 42 million bill due since 1987 
reginaldo panting secretary of economy and commerce told a news 
conference on friday that our position is not to pressure the 
panamanian government nor the chief of the defense forces gen

service honduras has the largest electrical processing plant in 
central america and also sells electricity to neighboring nicaragua

government of its debt with honduras 
at the time we warned that we could suspend the energy at the 
end of the month if panama doesnt immediately proceed to pay the 
debt but it hasnt done it 
he said panama had discussed the possibility of repaying the debt 
with sugar exports to honduras but has not done so 
faced with what has happened we are left with one other 
option cut the electricity we send to honduras panting said 
he said he will travel to panama again next week in a last 
attempt to resolve the problem 
noriega is considered panamas de facto leader he was indicted

luther failed to excite a public already indifferent to its own 
church 
from the fjords of norway to barren windswept iceland to the 
hightech affluence of sweden john pauls tour was unlike any of 
his previous trips to christian countries even those like britain 
where roman catholics are a minority 
faced with some reluctance to the visit by lutheran clergy the 
leader of the worlds 850 million roman catholics agreed to sit in 
silence in a lutheran cathedral in denmark referred to himself 
often as the bishop of rome rather than as pope and listened to 
chiding by lutheran bishops 
even to his own flock in a region with marked differences on 
sexual morality with romes teaching he used more cautious language 
than usual when dealing with family issues 
for a man used to drawing vast numbers of people the crowds were 
tiny in his final mass today of the 10day tour in the swedish 
city of vadstena about 2500 youths attended roman catholics 
represent less than 1 percent of the population of the five 
countries he visited 
i saw the pope in miami in 1987 i was very surprised there 
were so few people here said elizabeth clemmons of tampa fla 
as the pope stopped in trondheim norway she plans to marry a 
norwegian 
there were no protests although a fundamentalist protestant 
demonstrator rushed toward john paul during an outdoor mass friday 
security stopped the man who was unarmed 30 feet from the pope 
police said he wanted to hand the pontiff a leaflet 
the trip is scheduled to end today 
vatican officials assured that john paul was highly pleased with 
his trip and said it helped move along catholiclutheran relations 
i dont go to attract the masses but to preach the gospel 
john paul said midway through the trip i go to bring the gospel 
everywhere there are catholics but i also go to those who are not 
catholics especially here where there are christians 
the pope appeared to go out of his way to avoid offending 
in a region where birth control is encouraged and abortion rates 
are high john paul used such codewords as respect for the gift of 
life in all its forms rather than resort to explicit language 
his frequent reference to himself as bishop of rome was a 
sign of sensitivity for the people present explained australian 
archbishop edward cassidy the vatican undersecretary of state 
other terms such as supreme pontiff would be quite alien 
cassidy said 
norway iceland finland denmark and sweden are overwhelmingly 
lutheran although surveys have shown less than 10 percent regularly 
attend church on sundays 
one of the principal purposes of the trip was to further 
relations with the lutheran church dominant since the protestant 
reformation swept away catholicism four centuries ago 
some lutheran bishops opposed the visit and in denmark they 
insisted that john paul not participate in a prayer service in a 
lutheran cathedral 
the pope attended sitting near the altar and following the 
service in a prayerbook without speaking 
afterward in an exchange of speeches lutheran bishop ole 
bertelsen made no secret of differences between catholics and 
lutherans and told the pope nice words and smiling friendly church 
leader attitudes are not really what we need right now 
vatican officials however viewed the ecumenical meetings as a 
success and emphasized it is better to air differing points of view 
than to pretend all are in agreement 
after four hundred years of separation time is needed for the 
process of reconciliation and healing to take place john paul 
said friday in an ecumenical prayer service in uppsala not 
everything can be done at once but we must do what we can today 
with hope for what may be possible tomorrow

the yellow brick road leads to holland this 
weekend as four of the original munchkins join fans of the wizard 
of oz 
many believe the author who inspired the film classic l frank 
baum patterned part of dorothys travels to oz after local sites 
and people because he had a summer cottage in this town 
it really reminds me of the set said margaret pellegrini 
65 who played one of the sleepyheads who welcomed dorothy to oz 
dorothy apparently was modeled after a neighbor dorothy 
martindale who wore her hair in pigtails and had a small dog said 
festival organizer jl landry the emerald castle is said to be 
drawn from nearby castle park and a circle of houses called perry 
circle was the model for munchkinland she said 
this year the 50th anniversary of the mgm classic will be 
especially busy said meinhardt raabe who played the coroner who 
pronounced the wicked witch of the east dead after she was crushed 
by dorothys house 
former munchkins ruth duccini and mary ellen st aubin also 
appear at the festival which runs through sunday in this 
southwestern community near lake michigan

workers at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
dumped toxic chemicals into creeks that lead to water supplies for 
four denver suburbs and illegally burned hazardous wastes at the 
site according to an fbi affidavit 
both the department of energy which owns the plant and rockwell 
international corp which operates it covered up the contamination 
by stating that the plant was in compliance with environmental laws 
and regulations the affidavit alleged 
us magistrate hilbert schauer unsealed the affidavit friday 
after a newspaper challenged withholding of the information that led 
schauer to issue a search warrant for a raid on the plant tuesday by 
federal agents 
the plant which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons is 16 
miles northwest of denver 
the 116page affidavit indicates the justice department 
investigation into possible criminal violations of hazardous waste 
laws will focus on activities going back to november 1980 
the affidavit also questions the does decision to award an 86 
million bonus to rockwell for excellent management of rocky flats 
the rocky mountain news reported in fridays editions that the 
general accounting office also has launched an investigation of 
performance bonuses awarded rocky flats managers 
the gao probe was the third blow sustained by the facility this 
week 
on tuesday 75 fbi and environmental protection agency agents 
raided rocky flats in a move dubbed operation desert glow as 
part of the justice department inquiry on wednesday the colorado 
department of health announced it had found 25 environmental 
violations at the plant 
we need to check out every allegation that is in this 
document gov roy romer said of the affidavit if it the 
plant cant meet criteria for health and safety we close it down 
the affidavit revealed that fbi aerial infrared surveillance of 
the plant in december found that an incinerator in a plutonium 
reprocessing building that was closed for safety violations was 
being illegally operated 
the doe closed the building in october after an outside warning 
sign was accidently covered up and three doe inspectors walked in 
without protective garb the building reopened in january 
the affidavit also alleged that since 1986 rocky flats has 
generated at least 35 to 40 hazardous or mixed wastes sent for 
final disposal to various onsite facilities that do not have 
permits or interim status under the 1976 resource conservation and 
recovery act 
the knowing treatment storage and disposal of hazardous or 
mixed wastes without a permit is an rcra felony the affidavit 
said 
the illegal discharge of pollutants into walnut creek occurred 
nov 15 and 16 the affidavit alleged adding that the discharges 
and subsequent efforts to conceal them violated the clean water act 
walnut creek drains into the reservoir for broomfield a city of 
27600 residents 10 miles north of denver 
the fbi also detected liquid discharges into woman creek which 
flows into the lake supplying water to the cities of westminster 
northglenn and thornton just north of denver which have a combined 
population of about 157000 
testing of the creeks strongly suggests that the contamination 
is medical waste originating from a research laboratory or a 
pharmacy at rocky flats the affidavit said 
the affidavit went on to say that there was probable cause to 
believe rockwell and doe officials in november 1985 falsely 
certified that rocky flats was in compliance with all applicable 
groundwater monitoring requirements under the rcra 
in fact various rockwell and doe officials were aware of 
serious contamination and were informed that the monitoring system 
was deficient and did not comply with the rcra the affidavit said 
chris sankey a doe spokeswoman in washington said agency 
officials had not had time to study the affidavit and had no 
comment she also said she was unaware of the gao investigation 
in a news release the department said a special doe 
investigation team has been at rocky flats since june 6 but has not 
found any condition or situation which presents an imminent danger 
to the publics health or safety 
dennis hurtt a rockwell spokesman in denver declined to comment 
friday he said rockwell attorneys were reviewing the affidavit

an american military attache will interview a 
japanese monk who has reportedly said he saw american prisoners in 
the reeducation camp where he was held in vietnam a us embassy 
spokesman said today 
the monks daughter quoted her father as saying he shared a cell 
with three american prisoners for the last six years he spent in 
captivity she said her father did not remember their names but 
described them as young and healthy 
the monk iwanobu yoshida 65 reportedly suffers from mental 
disorders and a speech impediment he has been hospitalized since 
january when he returned to japan after being released from 14 years 
of imprisonment in vietnam 
in the past week he has given his first interviews to the 
japanese media raising interest with claims he saw americans held 
since the vietnam war 
vietnam denies holding american prisoners and recently it has 
cooperated with us officials searching for remains of americans 
missing in action 
yoshidas daughter keiko takatsuka told the associated press 
today that her father communicated with the americans in his cell 
through gestures 
my father told me that when he asked them if they were 
americans they nodded ms takatsuka said during a telephone 
interview from her home in sapporo on hokkaido japans northernmost 
island she said the prisoners were not allowed to speak to each 
other 
her report differed from one earlier in the week on the kyodo 
news service in which yoshida was quoted as saying he saw five or 
six american pows but never spoke with them and had been held 
apart from them the location of the reeducation camp has not been 
disclosed 
ms takatsuka told ap the kyodo reporter must have misunderstood 
because her father told her several times he had been held with the 
americans 
a us military attache will travel to sapporo on sunday to 
interview yoshida a us embassy spokesman said speaking 
anonymously 
he said ms takatsuka met with a us navy attache at the us 
embassy in tokyo recently to report on her fathers remarks and that 
the information was forwarded to washington for analysis 
ms takatsuka initially refused to speak with us officials 
saying her father was too ill according to the embassy spokesman 
yoshida suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment 
said hidenori hareyama a spokesman for shiraishi tokushukai 
hospital on hokkaido where yoshida is being treated 
only yoshidas daughter can understand what he says and his 
speech is at times incoherent hareyama said he refused to 
elaborate 
yoshida a buddhist monk told the kyodo news service that 
vietnamese political prisoners also called the foreigners in the 
camp americans 
ms takatsuka said her father does not remember the names of the 
three held in his cell but said they were still young and 
healthy 
yoshida told her he saw more american pows perhaps more than 10 
before he suffered a stroke three years ago my father is still 
afraid somebody will come and get him to throw him back in the 
vietnamese prison she said 
yoshida formerly a city councilman in mibari on hokkaido became 
a monk in 1966 and emigrated to vietnam where he set up a temple in 
saigon now called ho chi minh city he was granted south vietnamese 
citizenship in 1973 then was arrested in 1975 after the takeover of 
south vietnam by communist forces 
on jan 20 vietnam released yoshida for humanitarian reasons 
after appeals by international human rights groups including amnesty 
international 
a total of 1730 americans are listed as missing in action in 
vietnam and 634 are missing in cambodia laos and china according 
to us figures 
the indochina war ended in 1975 with communist victories over 
ussupported governments in vietnam cambodia and laos

syrian gunners shelled the coast north of 
beirut today killing four people and wounding six as an arab envoy 
tried to halt 12 weeks of bloodshed between syrian and christian 
forces 
a police spokesman said about 200 shells and rockets fired from 
syrian batteries in moslem west beirut exploded around the christian 
ports of jounieh and byblos early in the day 
he said the fatalities were civilians killed near jounieh when 
a 107mm katyusha rocket hit a residential district near the harbor 
the latest casualties brought the overall toll to 367 people 
killed and 1427 wounded since the current round of violence broke 
out march 8 between aouns christian army units and an alliance of 
syriandruse forces 
the escalation coincided with the arrival in beirut of lakhdar 
ibrahimi assistant arab league secretary general in a renewed 
effort to stabilize a ceasefire 
ibrahimi an algerian crossed beiruts dividing green line for 
talks with aoun at the generals bunker office under the 
bombravaged presidential palace of baabda east of the capital 
ibrahimi drove to moslem west beirut from damascus the syrian 
capital friday and held separate meetings with salim hoss who 
heads the moslem cabinet in the nations dual government and 
parliament speaker hussein husseini 
the arab envoy was dispatched to lebanon by the leaders of 
morocco saudi arabia and algeria to seek compliance with a 
ceasefire called may 26 the committee of three arab league heads 
of state was formed to find a solution to the 14year civil war 
within six months 
the three leaders also sent their foreign ministers on a tour of 
syria iraq and the five permanent member states of the un 
security council to promote a proposed settlement for the lebanese 
crisis 
the ministers prince saud alfaisal of saudi arabia abdel 
latif alfilali of morocco and bouallam bsayeh of algeria held a 
second sixhour meeting friday with syrian president hafez assad in 
damascus 
details of the discussions were not officially disclosed 
the three foreign ministers today arrived in baghdad where they 
were greeted by foreign minister tariq aziz 
alfilali told reporters we are sure we will find complete 
cooperation from iraqi officials in trying to find a solution to the 
lebanese crisis 
before leaving syria the algerian foreign minister said we 
tried in damascus to define the major subjects that could be 
achieved in the forseeable future he said that the solution is 
in the end in the hands of the lebanese and we were able to see 
damascus willingness to help lebanon 
the independent beirut daily paper annahar said the three were 
soliciting support for a sevenpoint settlement proposal 
the plan according to the paper calls for exerting 
international pressure on israel to withdraw its forces from south 
lebanon 
it also proposes the deployment of an algerian force along a 
75mile stretch of lebanons mediterranean coast to prevent the 
import and export of illegal material at the various ports 
the coastal strip referred to in the plan extends from just above 
the southern provincial capital of sidon through beirut to the 
northern city of tripoli 
the scenario also calls for lifting all sea land and air 
blockades reopening blocked roads between the sectors including 
the beirutdamascus highway that runs across sections of lebanon 
controlled by warring christian and druse militias the paper said 
it said arab military observers would be deployed at the 
crossings and along the beirutdamascus highway 
the plan also calls for convening a session of the lebanese 
parliament to consider a draft for political reforms and the 
election by parliament of a president who would pledge to implement 
the reforms 
the last point in the plan calls for discussing the question of 
syrian withdrawal from lebanon 
israel controls a 6to10mile deep strip of lebanese territory 
along their border it serves as a buffer against crossborder 
guerrilla attacks

polish leader wojciech jaruzelski says the 
communist partys resounding defeat in polands freest postwar 
elections may have been only a passing phenomenon 
at the polish embassy in london today a small group of polish 
emigres protested gen jaruzelskis visit with one banner 
declaring from poland to peking communism brings death 
jaruzelski arrived in london today after a oneday visit to 
belgium and he met for 25 minutes with foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe at heathrow airport 
in belgium jaruzelski said the election results were a 
reflection not only of the attitudes but also of the emotions of the 
polish people 
but as you know emotions are sometimes ephemeral he said in 
an interview in brussels with the british broadcasting corp he 
spoke in polish and his remarks were translated 
following a stop to lay a wreath at polish war graves in england 
today the communist party leader was to meet with prime minister 
margaret thatcher for lunch at her country estate chequers he 
plans to return to poland on sunday 
members of solidarity with solidarity a britishbased group 
organized their weekend vigil outside the embassy near a separate 
weeklong vigil outside the chinese embassy 
we are not saying that what happened in poland was as bad as 
the chinese massacres said protest organizer barbara rudewicz 
referring to the chinese armys attacks on prodemocracy protesters 
a week ago but in 1981 it was gen jaruzelski who brought out 
the tanks onto the streets of poland when several hundred people 
were killed during martial law 
solidarity was crushed at that time and later banned it was 
legalized under an april pact with the government 
in a statement released friday solidarity with solidarity 
described jaruzelski as a man decisively rejected by his nation 
in sundays elections 
in the polish voting for the new 100seat senate solidarity won 
92 seats and the other eight were undecided independent candidates 
were allowed to run for only 161 seats in the existing 460seat 
sejm or lower house but they won 160 of them 
only two of 35 top communist party leaders and their allies 
running on a special list of unopposed candidates gained a majority 
of yes votes allowing them to take seats without a new election 
jaruzelski said in a british newspaper interview this week that 
he would stand by the results and suggested that his communist party 
could lose power in totally free elections in 1993 
in the bbc interview jaruzelski said the elections were not a 
football match it is a political process 
he referred ruefully to his imposition of martial law in poland 
in 1981 and his banning of the free trade union solidarity 
sometimes it takes a long time before the revolution becomes 
civilized said jaruzelski we could not avoid it either 
mrs thatcher invited jaruzelski to britain after she visited 
poland last november and met with both government and solidarity 
leaders 
british officials said the prime minister was interested in 
talking with jaruzelski about the elections and his plans for the 
future 
jaruzelskis visit is part of widening contacts between poland 
and western government leaders who have welcomed the polish reforms 
french president francois mitterrand will visit poland next week 
and president bush is due to go there july 911

premier nikolai i ryzhkov today proposed sharp 
reductions in the vast soviet bureaucracy and said the remaining 
government ministries should turn many of their powers over to the 
nations 15 republics 
speaking to a joint session of the bicameral supreme soviet a 
new 542member fulltime legislature ryzhkov said that of the 50 
government ministries handling basic elements of the economy 
construction transportation agriculture and defense only 32 
would remain 
in addition he told the lawmakers in a session broadcast live on 
radio and television that the number of members of the council of 
ministers or cabinet that he heads will be slashed from 100 to 10 
the proposals which the legislature is to vote on later this 
month mark another step in president mikhail s gorbachevs 
attempts to streamline the soviet bureaucracy he has blamed for 
impeding his economic reforms they would also transfer many 
economic management functions to the 15 soviet republics many of 
which are campaigning for greater control over their affairs 
ryzhkov the 59yearold technocrat reelected premier on 
wednesday said the remaining ministries in moscow will focus on 
longrange planning and on scientific and technological help in the 
spheres they oversee the ministries would leave the daytoday 
managment they now provide to the republics 
at the same time two special commissions are to be formed one 
to handle emergencies such as natural and manmade disasters and 
another to map economic reforms 
since gorbachev became communist party leader in march 1985 he 
has tried to rid soviet society of a halfcentury of topheavy 
bureaucratic management by command epitomized by dictator josef 
v stalin 
the government ministries were a frequent target during 13 days 
of debate in the new soviet parliament the congress of peoples 
deputies 
at one point deputy anatoly miloserdny of byelorussia blamed the 
council of ministers for shortsightedness that he said led to the 
disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods 
gorbachev himself urged the deputies to grill the ministers on 
why they are dragging their feet on reforms he acknowledged 
complaints that government ministries are restructuring very 
slowly if at all and said we have to find out what is wrong 
ryzhkov announced nominees for the cabinet posts today and the 
supreme soviet is scheduled to hold confirmation hearings on them 
beginning june 19 
the congress of peoples deputies wrapped up its session friday 
after hearing andrei d sakharov 68 father of the soviet human 
rights movement say the parliament had not fulfilled its main 
task to establish a system of power to overcome economic and 
social problems to put an end to ecological madness 
the 1975 nobel peace prize laureate also claimed that by electing 
gorbachev president in an uncontested election and investing him 
with far greater powers in his 5year term the parliament had given 
the communist party chief absolute personal power 
gorbachev to loud applause in the kremlin palace of congresses 
vigorously objected to what he termed sakharovs attempt to 
abase the congress work

when president mikhail s gorbachev of 
the soviet union visits west germany next week hell look a lot 
more like a budding capitalist than a communist 
with superpower relations rapidly improving gorbachev is turning 
his attention to improving his nations faltering economy 
the inquisitive president will find theres much to learn from 
west germany one of the worlds richest countries and the global 
leader in exports 
mr gorbachevs main target is to improve the situation of the 
soviet population west germany has hightech knowhow and 
highquality machinery that would be useful for this says peter 
pietsch an economist at the commerzbank in frankfurt 
moscow is eager to intensify economic relations with west 
germany says ivan silayev a deputy premier in the kremlin soviet 
officials said in moscow last week that an estimated 40 million 
soviet citizens live in poverty and warned the country could face 
economic collapse in the next years 
economic cooperation with the federal republic west germany 
is of great importance it is the basis on which the whole field of 
relations between the ussr and the federal republic will be 
broadened silayev wrote in an article for the june 6 editions of 
west germanys die welt newspaper 
the fourday trip starting monday takes gorbachev to 
badenwuerttemberg the countrys richest state for demonstrations 
of high technology and talks with local leaders 
badenwuerttemberg is home to daimlerbenz the countrys largest 
company the stateowned soviet transport company already uses 
daimlerbenz trucks 
the visit also will take gorbachev to the ruhr region once 
germanys industrial heartland and now a leader in retooling for 
hightech businesses in addition gorbachev will see the hoesch 
steel factory a new ruhrarea rolling mill that sells to the 
soviets 
recent polls show that gorbachev is immensely popular in west 
germany and the growing gorbymania will be in evidence wherever 
the soviet president reaches out to ordinary citizens 
chancellor helmut kohl and other political leaders will be 
keeping that in mind when they discuss arms control and other 
international issues with the soviet chief 
gorbymania is such an overriding factor that the mass 
circulation bild newspaper even asked kohl if the visit would help 
the chancellors conservative party in this months european 
parliament elections 
oh come on now kohl snapped the dates have nothing to do 
with each other 
there has been some concern in the united states and other 
countries that west germany is growing fond of gorbachev 
kohl responds that the success of gorbachevss reforms will 
benefit everyone and west german businessmen want to be among the 
first beneficiaries 
we see a huge market in the soviet union said heinz 
skrzipietz spokesman for the salamander shoe company which sold 2 
million pairs of shoes to the soviets last year 
shoes are something everyone needs and we can provide them 
he told the associated press in a telephone interview from the 
companys offices in the badenwuerttemberg town of kornwestheim 
west german banks have also jumped on the perestroika bandwagon 
perestroika a russian term refers to gorbachevs economic and 
social restructuring of soviet society to make it run more 
efficiently 
last year a german bank consortium made a 153 billion line of 
credit available to the soviets for buying west german machinery to 
help improve the communist countrys food textile and clothing 
industries 
a small amount of money has been drawn from this line of credit 
so far said pietsch the economist commerzbank is one of the 
nine banks included in the consortium 
it takes time to draw on all this money because of 
negotiations on what projects to undertake using the credit he said 
gorbachev is still struggling to attain reforms that would not 
only help his countrys economy but also improve the business 
climate for foreign firms 
there is still a very long way to go said karlhermann fink 
secretarygeneral of the german eastwest trade committee which 
coordinates business ties between the countries 
sovietwest german trade slumped during the middle of the 1980s 
but bounced back last year reaching 836 billion up 8 percent 
from the year before 
west germany is currently the soviet unions biggest supplier in 
the west but only about 15 percent of west germanys exports go to 
the communist country 
the soviets buy west german goods ranging from highquality 
machine tools to consumer items they sell energy products to their 
german trading partners 
the soviet union is especially eager to increase the number of 
joint ventures with western companies since such operations employ 
local workers and give business to soviet materials suppliers

in 1982 a homosexual man with aids had a 30 
percent chance of living for 18 months 
in 1987 he had a 60 percent chance of living that long 
in 1982 doctors had only a vague idea of how aids was spreading 
and no idea what was causing it today they know its cause they 
have a drug to fight it and dozens more under study 
none of us can be satisfied until no patient dies of aids but 
there is some progress said dr samuel broder director of the 
us national cancer institute and a principal developer of the drug 
azt the only one so far approved to treat aids 
he spoke at the fifth international conference on aids which 
ended friday it drew 11800 people including 1320 journalists and 
hundreds of activists to montreal to discuss the scientific social 
and human sides of aids 
the conferences organizers were forced to turn away others 
because montreals convention center couldnt accommodate any more 
broders surprisingly optimistic assessment of progress toward 
better aids treatments contrasted with the pessimistic viewpoints 
expressed a year ago at the last international aids conference in 
stockholm 
many researchers there expressed disappointment with experimental 
drug trials and efforts to develop a vaccine but a year has passed 
and the picture has improved 
things are moving much more quickly now said dr anthony 
fauci director of the aids program at the national institutes of 
health in bethesda md 
this years conference was also distinguished by the 
participation of several hundred aids activists who demonstrated 
inside and outside the convention center every day 
they booed government officials for not moving faster against 
aids they demanded antidiscrimination protection access to 
experimental treatments and more money for research 
some of them were people with aids or pwas as they often call 
themselves their message was simple as their handlettered 
cardboard signs said we are all living with aids 
some scientists said they were unhappy that aids interest groups 
were allowed to attend because the protests distracted the 
scientists from their work others welcomed the reminder of the 
human side of the disease 
in the scientific sessions several groups reported initial 
success with aids vaccines in chimpanzees and monkeys among them 
was dr jonas salk who attracted media attention as the 
worldfamous developer of the polio vaccine but whose research 
findings were said to be no better than those of several other 
research groups 
some of the most promising research dealt with the development of 
new drugs for aids 
azt is extending the life span of aids patients but it has toxic 
side effects and in a disturbing development studies have shown 
that the aids virus can develop a resistance to azt making the drug 
no longer effective 
the surprise is it took this long to discover it said dr 
robert yarchoan of the us national cancer institute 
on the other hand the virus strains resistant to azt do not seem 
to be resistant to other aztlike drugs now under study thats 
been a surprise on the good side yarchoan said 
azt is one of a class of drugs called reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors it mimics genetic building blocks needed by the aids 
virus to link with genes inside cells to make more virus 
two newer drugs under study ddc and ddi work the same way and 
are among the most promising new agents said dr thomas merigan of 
stanford university a member of the committee overseeing federal 
drug trials in the united states 
as with cancer treatment the use of a combination of drugs might 
maximize their beneficial effects while minimizing their side 
effects he said 
perhaps the most exciting new drugs are socalled soluble cd4 and 
its relatives these drugs interfere with the process by which the 
aids virus invades cells 
they have to add up to one of our best prospects merigan 
said 
studies are just starting to show that cd4 can reduce levels of 
virus in the body he said whether that will improve the health of 
infected people is not yet known 
some drugs that have been tested have flopped they include 
dextran sulfate which looked promising a year or two ago and 
al721 a drug that many aids patients had pushed for 
merigan said he doubted the usefulness of dextran sulfate from 
the start but that 50 patients were used to study the drug in 
response to pressure and criticism from congress 
it means that our ddc study would have been 50 patients ahead 
if we didnt have this pressure he said 
but merigan said researchers are working as quickly as possible 
to evaluate new drugs 
broder predicted that the experimental results and the aids 
patients survival curves would be even better next year and the 
year after that

they havent bought television time or 
fullpage newspaper ads but the campaigning is still intense in the 
precinct of the house of representatives where democrats are trying 
to fill their top leadership posts 
even at this weekends paris air show junketing lawmakers may 
find their gourmet meals interrupted by telephone calls from the 
candidates seeking their votes in next wednesdays election 
two of the top three officers the democrats reelected just six 
months ago have resigned their leadership posts because of questions 
about their personal finances 
speaker jim wright stepped down rather than continue his struggle 
against charges by the ethics committee that he violated house rules 
on outside income and gifts the no 3 democrat majority whip tony 
coelho of california said he would step down rather than face 
inquiry into a junk bond deal 
last week democrats elected thomas s foley of washington the 
former majority leader as speaker of the house 
but even before that vote the campaigning for foleys old job 
and the whips job had already begun in the personal campaigning of 
congress the first person to ask for a members vote is considered 
likely to get it 
if you wait more than 37 seconds after theres a vacancy youre 
27 votes behind quipped rep dennis eckart dohio 
the two candidates seeking to replace foley as the no 2 man 
and become the natural successors to the speakership are reps 
richard gephardt dmo and ed jenkins dga 
gephardt who is considered the favorite by most people including 
jenkins supporters gave up a post in the house leadership to run 
for president in 1988 
he announced his campaign for majority leader with a 
presidentialstyle press release declaring he was part of a new 
generation that will lead the house and the democratic party into 
the future 
and in the current ethics climate one of gephardts strongest 
cards is the feeling that he is certified clean because running 
for president would have exposed any skeletons in his background he 
has promised if elected he will not run for president in 1992 
jenkins is from the more conservative side of the party and he 
says its time democrats include that viewpoint in the top 
leadership if not we shall continue to lose in national 
elections its that simple he said 
both jenkins and gephardt are members of the ways and means 
committee jenkins enjoys the support of that panels powerful 
chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
jenkins said late last week he would reassess his chances on 
tuesday and discussions were already underway for installing a 
conservative as a top leadership deputy if he didnt win but i 
will not be satisfied personally by that he said 
the whips race is a threeway event with each candidate already 
in a prominent party role 
rep william h gray iii dpa is chairman of the house 
democratic caucus rep beryl anthony dark is chairman of the 
democratic congressional campaign committee and rep david bonior 
is the chief deputy whip 
grays campaign has had to battle news reports that his personnel 
practices were under scrutiny by the justice department his office 
sent videotapes to house democrats on the issue gray held a press 
conference attacking the news leaks and he released affidavits from 
his staff supporting his claim that he is not the subject of an 
inquiry 
however the reports appear to have cut the momentum many 
expected would lead gray to a big win his supporters still contend 
hes ahead but theyre not confident a firstballot victory and 
gray is running hard 
gray recently reached a delegation of lawmakers visiting turkey 
one of his top aides said late last week that he was already on the 
telephone to paris where about six dozen lawmakers were attending 
the big annual aviation gathering 
both bonior and anthony also were burning up the telephone lines 
although one top bonior staffer expressed some jealousy at grays 
success in overseas calling 
were trying to save the taxpayers money were not doing a lot 
of overseas calling she said smiling 
boniors people claim to be within about 10 votes of gray and 
said they could beat him on a second ballot if no candidate received 
a majority in the first round 
but predicting a winner in the secretballot contests except in 
a case like foleys where hes unopposed is a risky business 
i think uncommitted is a very popular candidate eckart said

no issue in the savings and loan debate has 
generated so much ill will as the question of goodwill 
president bushs proposed sampl plan the most expensive bailout in 
us history goes to the house floor this week probably wednesday 
and legislators likely will spend most of their time debating what 
until recently has been an obscure accounting issue 
here are answers to some commonly asked questions about goodwill 
q what is goodwill 
a goodwill is the difference between what a business in this 
case a savings institution is worth if shut down and liquidated and 
what it would fetch if sold as a going concern goodwill represents 
such intangible assets as customer loyalty and name recognition 
q why is it important in the savings and loan debate 
a president bush wants to force sampl owners to risk more of their 
own money capital as a buffer between losses and the government 
deposit insurance fund more than a third of the industrys 60 
billion in capital at the end of 1988 consisted of goodwill which 
becomes worthless when an sampl closes 
q why do sampl supporters believe the institutions should keep 
their goodwill 
a most sampl goodwill is supervisory goodwill meaning it was 
approved by federal sampl supervisors regulators okd the accounting 
break for institutions willing to take failed sampls off the 
governments hands in the early 1980s giving them as long as 40 
years to write the goodwill off their books sampl executives complain 
that the government shouldnt go back on its word 
q whats the difference between normal goodwill and supervisory 
goodwill 
a goodwill usually is determined by what a willing buyer pays 
for a business on the open market however supervisory goodwill is 
the arbitrary amount assigned by regulators to make takeover deals 
work in this case the goodwill actually represents a hidden loss 
rather than something of value 
q why do critics of goodwill think its worth going back on the 
governments word 
a critics acknowledge that many of the institutions operating 
with goodwill are healthy in the sense that they are earning profits 
and most of their loans are sound but they say the institutions 
are dangerously vulnerable because the goodwill allows their owners 
to operate with little or none of their own money at risk thats a 
situation ripe for abuse critics argue because those sampls would 
have little incentive to prevent them from speculating wildly with 
depositors money those looking to phase out goodwill say its 
better to be unfair to sampl owners than to be unfair to the 
taxpayers who are picking up most of the 30year 285 billion bill 
for the sampl bailout 
q what are some of the compromises proposed on the goodwill 
issue 
a the bill passed by the house banking committee and endorsed by 
the administration would phase out goodwill from tangible capital by 
1995 institutions short of capital because of goodwill would be 
allowed to apply to regulators to avoid the stigma of a supervisory 
agreement but they would have to submit a business plan on how they 
plan to raise capital 
rep henry hyde rill wants to give sampls with goodwill the 
right to appeal its loss through administrative proceedings 
critics however say that could delay tougher standards for up to 
18 months 
rep james quillen rtenn would simply require regulators to 
honor past agreements on goodwill and other legislators are 
proposing variations

out when the figures get into the millions counting not just 
the student protesters but their families as well 
reagan was asked by cbs charles kuralt do you feel optimistic 
enough to say that you feel it in your bones they are going to win

sweeping the communist world just look poland the other day the

scores of americans boarded us embassy 
buses and vans from nearby beijing to evacuate this port city 
despite its relative calm after the military crushed the 
prodemocracy movement in the capital 
the convoy of three buses and two vans carried 89 foreigners 
mostly americans from the sheraton tianjin hotel 75 miles northwest 
to the beijing airport where many sought flights to hong kong and 
tokyo 
most of the evacuees were students teachers tourists and oil 
field workers many said they were nervous about being so close to 
beijing where hundreds of residents were killed last weekend when 
troops entered tiananmen square to quell the student movement for 
more freedom 
but they said it had been quiet in tianjin the nations 
thirdlargest city with about 8 million people 
this is the calmest city said chilin shih of somerset 
nj who was in tianjin for an international phonetics conference 
but it only takes two hours for the troops to get here 
the section of tianjin through which the convoy passed appeared 
normal there were no troops visible buses were filled with 
passengers and markets appeared well stocked 
its been very peaceful said ann marie king 38 of 
scottsdale ariz i havent felt threatened in any way in 
tianjin 
us students living in tianjin said there was a demonstration 
last sunday to protest the killings in beijing but not much activity 
since 
its been relatively quiet said philip comeau 23 of 
gardner mass i think the students lost some of the enthusiasm 
because of the deaths theyre a little scared now 
the convoy was arranged by the embassy after the us state 
department recommended all americans leave china following the 
recent turmoil 
the americans sipped beer and wine in the hotel bar before filing 
onto the buses shortly before 3 pm for the trip to beijing the 
only delay came just outside tianjin when the convoy stopped for a 
regular passport check by police 
us diplomats said police were cooperative when the convoy 
entered tianjin to pick up the foreigners officers were stationed 
at major intersections to point the vehicles toward the hotel 
they made sure we didnt get lost said larry wortzel an 
assistant army attache who led the convoy 
the convoy provided the first opportunity for foreigners to 
travel outside beijing with government approval since the 
confrontation in tiananmen square 
no soldiers were visible during the 3hour trip in the 
countryside peasants were seen harvesting wheat and others tending 
neat vegetable plots 
young men lazily shot billiards at tables placed by the roadside 
while old women sat talking beside the highway under trees 
brad tonita of calgary alberta watched the scene from a van 
window as he smoked american cigarettes and drank chinese beer with 
other oil workers who drove six hours from shandong province to 
tianjin to join the evacuation 
we feel its time to get out before things get bad he said 
when things settle out well be back

eighty years after ernie scott rode his 
horse across the south dakota badlands and arrived late for his 
wedding with maud seidler they still disagree about what kept him 
ernie 101 says he paused after getting the marriage license in 
pierre to see a jailed ax murderer maud 97 says he stayed to 
watch the hanging 
both agree he got back before dark they married that evening on 
june 16 1909 and settled down in nowlin a prairie town that no 
longer exists 
the anniversary this week of one of the worlds longest marriages 
will be a time for memories and visits sunday from four generations 
of descendants the guinness book of world records lists two 86year 
marriages one beginning in 1753 the other in 1853 as the worlds 
longest but doesnt list the current longest surviving couple 
i think were lucky to be married 80 years and still have our 
complete family circle thats kind of a record itself mrs scott 
said 
the scotts who have three daughters 16 grandchildren 48 
greatgrandchildren and 34 greatgreatgrandchildren have led 
quiet honest hardscrabble lives 
they shared most of the 20th century living in minnesota south 
dakota georgia michigan indiana and california with stops along 
the way they couldnt afford a honeymoon and never went any place 
more exotic than canada 
old age is not for sissies reads an embroidered kitchen 
wallhanging 
ernie and maud are no sissies and the phrase on the wall 
reflects their nononsense approach and the humor they say played a 
big role in their marriage 
i like funny things she said he used to come out with the 
funniest expressions and he was witty as could be hes not that 
way anymore 
scott hard of hearing and confined to a wheelchair may not be 
the quipster he was but hes still sharp he has a full head of 
white hair a strong voice and keen memory 
all i thought about when i was younger was having a good 
time he said i thought when you laughed and had a good time 
it added to your life it did i guess something kept me going 
their youngest daughter gwen crippen 72 said one reason her 
parents got along so well is that they often lived in different 
places and couldnt hear each other much when they were together 
it was always happy when they got together but next thing dad 
would be off working someplace else she said he wasnt 
satisfied he was always looking 
scott was born in minnesota and picked corn as a youth he became 
a barber charging 10 cents a shave and two bits a haircut and says 
he had a brief amateur boxing career at 18 and 19 
i had about 200 bouts and i never was marked he said 
proudly with nobody around to dispute him i never got knocked 
down i never was hurt they put my picture up in the barber 
school i had a smile on my face and they said it was the smile 
you couldnt knock off i think i could box a little yet 
he farmed in south dakota and played the fiddle at dances but he 
and his wife left the prairies during the great depression when the 
dust bowl took over the land 
we was dried out and we was froze out he said 
scott became a railroad car inspector in gary ind he returned 
to minnesota as a house mover and worked in a detroit factory 
during world war ii 
when mrs scott got sick in the cold of the north she and the 
kids moved to atlanta and she worked as a hotel clerk 
she met babe ruth when the new york yankees stayed at the hotel 
but was disappointed that he was much shorter than she expected 
during world war ii she joined the coast guard working aboard 
great lakes boats 
mrs scott moved to california in 1951 but scott stayed in 
minnesota and built houses visiting during the winter in 1965 he 
retired and joined her 
nobody is always happy but we had our share of good times 
he said youd wonder where youre going to eat the next meal 
sometimes and youd feel happy when you did but we never went too 
hungry 
over the years mrs scott has gone through whole libraries of 
books the happiest time of her life was when she was in school she 
adds with a laugh i wasnt married then 
she straightens slowly getting out of a chair 
i must be getting old she said 
in the parlor is a photo of ernie and maud made before their 
wedding he was 6 feet tall 6 inches taller than now and 
straight as a cornstalk a handsome young farmer with bib overalls 
and hair parted in the middle she looked pretty in a long 
checkered frock 
her advice for young couples is you have to go in with the 
idea that youre going to stay together 
weve never done anything dramatic never met any presidents 
and never went to jail mrs scott said but weve been a happy 
family and had a happy time in life 
i never blacked his eye once she said and he never 
blacked mine he might have wanted to but he never did

when the trees in sims park in euclid ohio 
began toppling into lake erie officials in the cleveland suburb 
turned to their congressman rep edward feighan for help 
but when the army corps of engineers proved reluctant to build 
offshore barriers to block the waves battering the parks 
shoreline feighan chose the best way he knew to get the message 
across that he wanted the job done 
he composed a single paragraph stating that the corps shall 
undertake the project and inserted it into legislation congress 
hopes to complete this week rushing billions of dollars to veterans 
foster care providers and other programs running low in funds 
this is a bill that is certain to see enactment in some form or 
another the ohio democrat said last week in explaining why his 
provision ended up in the spending measure 
feighan was not alone dozens of lawmakers have sought to use the 
spending measure as a way to get favorable treatment for local 
projects a capitol hill ritual with bills that are seen as 
mustpass 
the senate approved a 33 billion version of the legislation 
last wednesday two weeks after the house approved its own 37 
billion measure the money is for the rest of fiscal 1989 which 
ends sept 30 bargainers from the two chambers plan to try to work 
out a compromise package next week and ship it to the white house 
for president bushs signature 
but sprinkled into the socalled dire emergency spending bill are 
provisions from senators and representatives calibrated to elicit 
smiles back home 
there is 75 million to rebuild a crumpled radio telescope in 
greenbank wva home state of the senate appropriations committee 
chairman democrat robert byrd 
the federal aviation administration is ordered to spend up to 
360000 for aviation research it conducts with the university of 
minnesota in the district of rep martin olav sabo and senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan obtained 275000 for kansas state 
university to help farmers cope with drought 
the net worth of the special projects comes to just a small 
fraction of the overall bill but they come under fire from critics 
who say they add to the federal deficit and show a visceral 
inability by lawmakers to just say no to spending taxpayers dollars 
theyre like a bunch of kids in the candy store says carol 
cox president of the committee for a responsible federal budget 
the bipartisan group that advocates deficit reduction 
cox complains that when lawmakers from the two chambers hash out 
their differences over the bill few projects for the folks back 
home are likely to drop out 
they say ill take yours if you take mine she says 
lawmakers involved in the process take umbrage at such criticism 
house appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten dmiss 
says federal spending on local problems increases the national 
wealth and he concedes that the practice is so widespread that he 
has so far received more than 3500 requests from colleagues who 
want special projects placed in next years spending bills 
they represent their districts whitten says of his fellow 
legislators they know whats there 
in an era of tight budgets lawmakers have perfected several ways 
of helping their districts without ordering new federal spending 
some provisions order federal agencies to set aside portions of 
their budgets for particular projects thus language by wyoming gop 
sens malcolm wallop and alan simpson requires the us forest 
service to delve into its coffers for 400000 for research into 
last summers forest fires in yellowstone national park 
other clauses command bureaucrats to do what congress wants that 
is the case with feighans provision which in effect orders the 
corps of engineers to start a 17 million project it has so far 
declined to undertake the money was actually provided in 
legislation two years ago 
still other sections subtly prod agencies to obey congressional 
desires the report accompanying the senates bill urges the 
department of health and human services to give serious 
consideration to hiring more workers in honolulu departments 
ignore such language at their own risk 
examples of local projects appended to the spending bill include 
1 million to be divided among west virginia maine north 
dakota tennessee and vermont to computerize their criminal records 
an extra 150000 for work on an agricultural research center in 
lane okla 
repeal of earlier legislation blocking the military from 
changing its strength in alaska the army once wanted to reduce its 
forces in the state it now wants to add a headquarters there 
urging the agriculture department to buy more apples for school 
breakfasts thus helping an industry plagued by the alar 
controversy introduced by washingtons two senators democrat brock 
adams and republican slade gorton 
66 million to subsidize airlines serving small towns in 38 
states and puerto rico

intelligence experts say theyre not surprised 
that president bush admits he cant say for sure whos calling the 
shots in china 
real time intelligence that is what is happening now is 
almost impossible to come by said one administration official 
the official who is familiar with the daily intelligence 
briefings prepared by the departments of state and defense the cia 
and other sources said the presidents comment that the situation 
in china is very very murky came directly from such reports 
at one point bush even joked about the problem saying hed 
called chinas 84earold leader deng xiaoping but the line was 
busy i couldnt get through 
the reason us officials have so little information about who 
may or may not be in power at any given time or who gave specific 
orders for the savage attack on the prodemocracy demonstrators is 
quite simple the experts say 
theres no access if they dont want to respond to the 
president of the united states they sure as hell arent going to 
respond to the ambassador the administration official said 
he and others speaking on intelligence matters spoke only on 
condition that their names and exact titles not be used 
china which only began to open up during the past decade has 
traditionally posed a problem for foreigners seeking detailed 
information 
the leaders sequester themselves in special compounds and are not 
seen unless they wish to be seen they tend to keep their decisions 
within a very tight circle and for the most part have had nearly 
complete control over the mass media 
the dearth of human intelligence that gleaned by personal 
contact has been a big difficulty in the current unrest the 
administration official said 
us diplomats tend to be exposed to their counterparts who 
spout the party line in normal times said another source 
familiar with the diplomatic scene in beijing 
so when there is a undoubted conflict within the party 
government and top military leadership they are especially careful 
to keep it obscure from the rest of the world said the diplomatic 
source 
during the past week us ambassador james lilley has met twice 
with the vice foreign minister in beijing and secretary of state 
james a baker iii has called the chinese ambassador to the state 
department twice 
embassy officials have contacted officials from the chinese 
ministry of national defense the ministry of education and the 
civil aviation administration 
also contacts have taken place with some chinese military 
officers who are personally acquainted with us officials in 
beijing and they have been providing some information but its 
not very satisfactory the administration official said 
the official admitted with some frustration that we dont have 
any feel for what is going on in what he called the dark 
stretches of provincial china 
the diplomatic source said the government has ample reports 
about the situation in beijing but there is an important 
distinction between being able to observe what is going on the 
outside and having access to the inner workings of the party and 
government he said 
the administration official pointed out that information culled 
from technical sources such as satellite photos or electronic 
surveillance can only go so far in providing uptodate information 
overhead photos pictures of troops massed and locations and 
tanks that isnt going to tell you who does what to whom during a 
groupbygroup or persontoperson struggle for political power 
said the official 
although he refused to specifically discuss electronic 
surveillance the official noted that the sheer volume of 
information poses a problem 
you have a whole mass of information to sort out it has to 
translated analyzed and sometimes only after the fact do you 
find something has happened he said 
one important source of information is the news media and us 
officials freely admitted they had their eyes glued to the 
roundtheclock coverage provided by the 24hour cable news network 
cnn has been one of the sturdy resources for information 
during the beijing crackdown the administration official said 
we cannot presume to do without the information that the media 
transmit said another calling the presence of the us 
television networks of tremendous importance 
the united states also cooperates with other foreign embassies in 
china but everybodys been somewhat embarrassed really at how 
difficult and unsuccessful theyve been in getting any 
information the administration official said were all in the 
same boat 
sometimes the official said expectations are just too high 
its a magic word people really think that intelligence 
people are omniscient but boy they sure arent the official

a onetime altar boy who escaped the 
barrio to become a harvard university student was convicted of 
pulling six armed robberies during college vacations 
jose luis razo 22 showed no emotion as he was convicted friday 
by an orange county superior court jury 
i think that none of us wanted to find him guilty said juror 
dean montanye but there was just too much evidence on most of the 
counts and we couldnt get his excellent memory out of our minds 
the prosecution rested heavily on a videotaped confession in 
which razo recounted with vivid detail the holdups by a gunman in a 
ski mask defense attorney john barnett maintained it was a false 
confession given in a stupor induced by the drug phencyclidine 
better known as pcp or angel dust 
jurors who deliberated three days acquitted razo of four other 
robbery counts including two that he had confessed to but they 
also convicted him of trying to escape from police after his arrest 
in 1987 
he faces a maximum sentence of 15 years and four months in 
prison sentencing is scheduled for aug 4 
razo was charged with committing 10 armed robberies between 
december 1985 and june 1987 in the confession razo told detectives 
he robbed fastfood restaurants grocery stores a dairy and a drug 
store 
razo testified that he confessed to the robberies in a 
drugdriven schizophrenic episode describing crimes actually 
committed by a friend and drug dealer richard longoria 
when deputy district attorney ravi mehta pointed out that the 
friend was in jail during three of the robberies razos lawyer 
suggested those holdups were committed by his clients younger 
brother albert 
razo a product of a poor la habra neighborhood was an altar boy 
and boys club boy of the year and an a student at his roman 
catholic high school a standout prep football player he was wooed 
by more than 60 colleges when he graduated 
he chose a scholarship to harvard where just 47 percent of the 
student body is hispanic as a freshman in 1985 he decided to major 
in psychology 
he always said look how good im doing im mexican im 
trying to make it in a white world his sister martha once told 
an interviewer 
but in a jail interview right after his confession and arrest in 
july 1987 he said at harvard i didnt fit im a homeboy now

students whose stubborn calls for democracy 
brought a military crackdown that left hundreds dead said saturday 
they were still trying to understand what happened and ride out a 
campaign of political repression 
im just trying to leave the country one beijing university 
student said gloomily for more than 2000 years chinese have put 
up with governments like this it will take a long time to change 
the mood of confusion and frustration on beijing college campuses 
contrasted sharply with the spirit one week ago when most students 
were confident the government would have to bend to their demand for 
dialogue 
then came last weekends military assault on student protesters 
in tiananmen square in which nearly 300 people were killed by 
official count and as many as 3000 by unofficial count 
student leaders went into hiding thousands of others fled home 
the few who remained on campuses seemed in shock all said they 
still wanted democratic change in china and several said they would 
fight the government from underground 
this government cannot last long the people will rise up 
and a leader will emerge said a math student at beijing 
university 
but even the defiant ones acknowledged they had no idea how to 
put their ideas into action 
right now is not the time the math student said maybe in 
a few months he paused and thought but maybe students will 
just go back to school in september and it will stay quiet who 
knows 
i dont think the ordinary people can do anything said a 
woman at beijing normal university change cant come from below 
it has to come from above we have to wait until the communist party 
decides to change itself the leaders arent concerned for the good 
of the people all they think about is holding onto power 
by weeks end the government intensified political repression 
which included arrests of protest leaders and a propaganda campaign 
against the students in the staterun media 
the government announced saturday that several student leaders 
were arrested including gua haifeng the secretary of the united 
association of beijing universities the independent student group 
that led the seven weeks of protests in tiananmen square 
it said 12 people were arrested at beijing university and charged 
with stealing but that they were not students of the school 
authorities ripped down protest posters and soldiers patrolled the 
university district in northwestern beijing but only one person 
reported seeing uniformed soldiers enter a campus and then only 
briefly 
the sprawling treecovered campuses of beijing university and 
beijing normal university have become shady havens for about 1000 
students each or about onetenth the normal student population 
school officials declared an early start to summer vacation 
which normally would have begun in two weeks 
most who remained on campus were seniors who said they were 
waiting to receive diplomas and government job assignments others 
said they were waiting for rail service to return to normal so they 
could go home 
they worked on senior theses read novels played pingpong and 
basketball and shuffled around their gloomy hushed dormitory halls 
anxiously watching political developments 
certainly there will be a serious political campaign of 
denunciation said the woman at beijing normal university maybe 
many intellectuals will be arrested 
the official media began to carry a steady stream of reports 
denying that soldiers killed unarmed civilians and highlighting 
civilian attacks on soldiers 
whenever there is so much propaganda who can believe it a 
woman student at beijing university said scornfully 
but other students worried that people outside beijing who did 
not see the soldiers violent attack would believe government 
denials 
most chinese are peasants they believe what the government 
says they want to believe said another beijing university 
student they dont want to believe foreign news reports 
even the students had trouble understanding the attack 
no one thought the soldiers would fire many said 
amid the confusion frustration and resignation predominated 
nothing can be done now what good would it be to demonstrate 
the government has shown it doesnt care said a student from the 
northwestern city of xian 
many of the protests were directed against senior leader deng 
xiaoping 84 and premier li peng 60 who imposed martial law 
deng xiaoping may die soon but we will still have to wait for 
li peng to die and that will take a long time said the woman 
from beijing normal university 
forget about politics she advised we should just try to enjoy 
life

sin city is about to meet its maker 
the first contingents of up to 18000 southern baptists began 
arriving this weekend for an evangelistic blitz in the nations 
gambling capital they hope to leave behind 12 new churches and tens 
of thousands of religious tracts by the end of their annual 
convention 
i embrace the old philosophy if someone gives you a lemon you 
make lemonade said john b wright a convention organizer 
las vegas which has welcomed conventions of strippers and 
swingers in recent years is ready for the southern baptists 
we want all the conventions we can get and we dont give a damn 
who they are said john reible a spokesman for the las vegas 
chamber of commerce 
the site represents a marriage of convenience for southern 
baptists and the city built on the vices they condemn 
the 148 millionmember southern baptist convention has more than 
doubled its membership in a quarter century and surpassed the united 
methodist church as the nations largest protestant denomination 
las vegas a desert town of 5600 little more than five decades ago 
is growing at the rate of 3000 people a month and there are now 
about 700000 people in the region 
las vegas is one of only 15 us cities that can provide the 
hotel rooms and exhibit space for a southern baptist convention 
said alvin c shackleford a convention spokesman 
it just seemed sooner or later we would accept the invitation 
of the people of las vegas to come he said there are about 
22000 southern baptists in 71 churches in nevada 
six years after the denomination voted to meet in las vegas the 
decision still evokes controversy and many southern baptists have 
decided to stay home 
while conventions in recent years have drawn as many as 45000 
people estimates for the convention running tuesday through 
thursday range from 13000 to 18000 
reasons include the reluctance of southern baptists to expose 
their children to the gambling scene the citys remoteness from the 
denominations strongholds in the southeast and an apparent lack of 
burning issues as the struggle between the denominations moderates 
and conservatives stretches into its 11th year 
southern baptists leaders say las vegas offers an opportunity to 
put aside internal battles and emphasize evangelism 
the choice of las vegas was deliberate in that the southern 
baptist convention hopes it can do sort of an evangelistic blitz in 
las vegas said stan hastey executive director of the southern 
baptist alliance a moderate group 
a series of revivals in city churches led up to a campaign 
saturday in which about 2000 southern baptists were expected knock 
on doors around las vegas 
to keep the focus on evangelism when the meetings begin 
convention president jerry vines said he is seeking postponement of 
a controversial proposal by conservatives to create a religious 
liberty commission the commission would lobby congress on issues 
such as organized prayer in public schools and tax credits for 
tuition paid to parochial schools 
church leaders said the internal struggle has taken a toll on the 
evangelistic efforts of the denomination where membership has 
increased barely more than half a percent in each of the last two 
years 
the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing said 
jay strack president of the conference of southern baptist 
evangelists 
on wednesday the conference plans to lead thousands of southern 
baptists down the gambling strip to distribute 10000 new testaments 
and 20000 gospel tracts strack said 
las vegas officials and some church leaders say the city 
variously known over the years as sin city sin city west and lost 
wages is undeserving of special attention 
las vegas is probably no more notorious in its pagan qualities 
than any other city hastey said 
robert powers a spokesman for the las vegas convention and 
visitors authority said life in the residential areas outside the 
strip is little different from anywhere else 
in addition to bringing in up to 15 million in revenue the 
southern baptist convention should help the citys image powers 
said 
i think its good for the city that a group like this is 
meeting here he said

the government has switched from gunfire to 
propaganda and intimidation following its assault on the 
prodemocracy movement 
chinese citizens who have seen the signs before face what could 
be the worst state backlash against free thought since the 196676 
cultural revolution 
already chinese sources say police are arresting intellectuals 
who supported the sevenweeklong student movement authorities 
announced saturday that 400 people including student leaders had 
been rounded up for agitation 
hundreds of people in cities outside beijing also have been 
arrested in the unrest following last sundays military attack in 
beijing that left up to 3000 people dead 
student leaders who demanded democratic reforms press freedom 
and an end to government corruption have been branded as 
counterrevolutionaries and told to turn themselves in 
activists charged with the same crime after the democracy 
wall movement of 197879 were imprisoned for up to 15 years 
many chinese intellectuals usually the first to suffer when the 
communist party asserts its authority have gone underground 
some student leaders also are in hiding a few are believed to 
have fled to embassies fang lizhi chinas leading dissident is 
sheltered at the us embassy 
we now live in terror said one student 
show trials like the one for mao tsetungs widow jiang qing 
and her leftist gang of four after the cultural revolution are a 
possibility executions of some people accused of attacking police 
or soldiers seem certain 
however relatively few leading dissidents may face criminal 
charges instead they could be suppressed in a more subtle campaign 
of fear and reprisal that also would affect the lives of millions of 
chinese 
workers already have been docked pay and threatened with 
dismissal for participating in demonstrations 
the government has begun a massive propaganda campaign to drum 
home the belief that the military carried out the will of the masses 
in attacking unarmed protesters the official press insists that not 
one shot was fired when troops stormed tiananmen square in beijing 
last sunday 
thousands of reporters had joined the students in calling for 
press freedom for one heady moment they were permitted to print 
what they saw as the truth 
now the press is once again a conduit for official 
pronouncements 
one chinese reporter expressed surprise when a foreigner asked 
for a copy of the partys peoples daily theres no news in it 
he said 
repression of free thought has been a fixture of communist rule 
in china 
in 1957 leader mao tsetung lured critics into the open with the 
slogan let 100 flowers bloom let 100 schools of thought 
contend within months he banished thousands of freethinkers to 
prison and reeducation camps 
many victims eventually returned to their lives only to be 
caught up in the orgy of violence of the cultural revolution people 
were persecuted for their intellectual background their work with a 
foreign company speaking a foreign language or traveling abroad 
tiananmen square the symbolic heart of china is itself no 
stranger to government repression in 1976 security forces stormed 
the square and killed about 100 people protesting an attempt by 
maos wife and other leftists to seize power 
senior leader deng xiaoping himself disgraced during the 
cultural revolution took power in the late 1970s he promised then 
that ideological struggles would no longer interfere with chinas 
urgent need to fight poverty and modernize 
last week was not the first time deng has used force however 
when democracy wall leaders began to question oneparty rule in 
their daring posters deng imprisoned dozens of people 
he responded to prodemocracy student demonstrations 2 years ago 
by purging party chief hu yaobang a reformer and his designated 
successor hus death in april touched off the new round of protests 
despite his oftquoted remark that china will have to let in a 
few flies when it opens its windows to the world he stands firmly 
against what he calls spiritual pollution from the west 
deng and other oldguard conservatives who back him also share a 
deepseated phobia of political unrest 
still the chinese people returned this spring to reassert their 
demands for greater freedom they are bound to do so again after 
this new crisis

vice president dan quayle embarking sunday on 
a trip to central america will confer with salvadoran government 
and rebel leaders in a climate of escalating violence that threatens 
the striferiddled countrys new administration 
quayles fourday trip is designed in part to show support for el 
salvadors new rightist president alfredo cristiani whose top 
adviser was gunned down by assassins on friday barely a week after 
cristiani took office 
in addition to his talks with cristiani quayle will meet with 
nonfighting rebel leaders closely allied with the leftist 
guerrillas most likely ruben zamora and guillermo ungo as well as 
other opposition politicians and the countrys military leaders his 
office said 
elsewhere on the trip us concerns about panama and nicaragua 
will be high on the agenda during quayles stops in guatemala 
honduras and costa rica he plans to meet with the presidents and 
other leaders in those countries and also will visit combatants and 
officials of the contra movement that has been fighting nicaraguas 
sandinista government 
quayle will arrive in el salvador just days after cristianis top 
cabinet minister jose antonio rodriguez porth and two bodyguards 
were shot down in a blaze of gunfire cristiani blamed the killings 
on the guerrillas who are organized under the umbrella group 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
the white house condemning the shooting as vicious and 
despicable murder said quayle will deliver president bushs 
condolences to the rodriguez family and cristiani 
quayle called it an attempt to kill not only a man but 
democracy 
during his trip quayle also will try to spur the latin nations 
into a new plan to bolster thusfar futile efforts to depose 
panamas manuel antonio noriega and step up pressure against the 
leftist nicaraguan government said his press secretary david 
beckwith 
the vice president will sound out reaction in the region to 
further us action against panama if an organization of american 
states effort fails in its mission to mediate a transfer of power in 
panama the press secretary said 
the united states supports the oas mediation team that last week 
was given an additional six weeks to resolve the panama stalemate 
the teams initial foray failed to budge noriega from power after he 
invalidated results from the election last month that was widely 
seen as rigged by noriega 
the administration last week blasted nicaragua for sending 
weapons to panama for use against a potential us military attack 
the state department also accused the sandinistas last week of 
denying the opposition fair representation in the allpowerful 
tribunal that will oversee next years elections 
quayle will be seeking latin support for us condemnation of 
what officials say is a continuing pattern of nicaraguan arms 
shipments to el salvadors leftist rebels 
in el salvador quayle is expected to convey a more positive tone 
than the stern lecture he delivered to military leaders in february 
then he warned that el salvador risked cut off of its more than 1 
millionperday in us aid unless it made progress on human rights 
and a quashing of death squad activity 
us officials say they are pleased so far with cristianis young 
government but quayle will underscore the need to maintain 
scrupulous human rights standards in the face of increasing scrutiny 
by congressional and other critics who fear the ascension of 
cristianis arena party heralds a new open season for death squads 
the rebels have pledged to make the country ungovernable under 
arena and cristianis political opponents say the polarization they 
foresaw under arena governance has begun

former president reagan says he believes the 
democratic reform movement in china will eventually emerge 
victorious despite the beijing governments current crackdown 
against the movement 
in an interview to be broadcast on the cbs sunday morning 
program reagan said he was optimistic about the longterm 
prospects because what were seeing now is what a lot of us have 
known for many years that communism couldnt really be a 
successful system 
reagan also said the leadership in china like soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev faces its most serious challenge from 
hardliners within the ruling communist party politburo 
in the soviet union he gorbachev came in and found hed 
inherited an economic basket case so he knows that his opposition 
is going to be behind him not the people out in front of him its 
going to be that politburo well the same thing in china reagan 
said 
regarding the chinese government reagan said those people 
that are being hardnosed right now dont they have to think twice 
about whether they want to take on the people in the street 
he indicated that the reform movement could not be simply stamped 
out when the figures get into the millions counting not just 
the student protesters but their families as well 
reagan was asked by cbs charles kuralt do you feel optimistic 
enough to say that you feel it in your bones they are going to win 
some day 
the former president replied yes i do because this is 
sweeping the communist world just look poland the other day the 
first election in more than 30 years and they voted against 
communism 
reagan interviewed in los angeles was asked about his feelings 
on the may 5 conviction of fired national security council aide 
oliver north on three charges aiding and abetting obstruction of 
congress destroying government documents and taking an illegal 
gratuity in the irancontra affair 
north was acquitted on nine other counts including false 
statements to congress obstruction of a presidential inquiry 
conversion of travelers checks to personal use and conspiracy to 
defraud the treasury and internal revenue service 
reagan said about the verdict i was not disappointed in the 
fact that nine of the charges were dropped 
but he said he was handicapped in making any substantive 
comment because north is now appealing the conviction 
that is before the courts and i dont want to say anything that 
is out of line besides which i have a handicap around this whole 
thing it has been falsely portrayed in most of the press the whole 
irancontra situation it has been portrayed as if we were trading 
arms for hostages with the government of iran as it was then 
reagan said

with names like subhuman project squid 
gossamer albacore and speed stick for their oceangoing inventions 
it may seem that entrants in the national humanpowered submarine 
races take the whole thing lightly 
but competition promises to be fierce when 19 teams from 
universities and corporations around the country gather june 23 to 
25 for the race sponsored by the ha perry foundation for undersea 
research 
made of lightweight materials most of the subs will be propelled 
by humans pedaling bicycle drive trains one sub is armpowered and 
another works with a pushpull operation 
twomember dive teams wearing scuba gear in their flooded but 
sealed submarines must maneuver around a milelong kidneyshaped 
course in ocean water that is about 23 feet deep in this inaugural 
race 
teams will be rated on speed of course but also such other 
factors as cost efficiency and design innovation 
ocean engineering majors at florida atlantic university are 
putting the finishing touches on their entry the fautilus 
from what we saw out there when we were on the course its 
going to be difficult to get the submarines out and running said 
fau team leader brent hoelzer the lightweight subs will have to 
maneuver in the strong surf at nearby singer island 
he coordinated design of a 12foot cigarshaped submarine with 
the lowest volume and surface area features that he believes will 
lead the student project to victory in the 15 to 20minute race 
but thats what the other teams think too 
everybodys going to win you talk to the guys at mit 
massachusetts institute of technology and theyre fastest they 
wont even think about anybody else winning the guys at the naval 
academy are the same way said maggie linskey merrill foundation 
director and race coordinator 
hoelzer openly frets about reports that the gossamer albacore 
entry by lockheed advanced marine systems of san diego was built for 
speed with the help of 15 engineers and that navy brainpower was 
borrowed by naval academy midshipmen for their teardropshaped 
project squid short for submerged quick intervention device 
oh good we got them worried said gordon isomura 
lockheeds manager of engineering programs but he acknowledged his 
team ran into trouble running its torpedoshaped sub in murky waters 
in our bay where we were trying to run we couldnt see five 
feet in front of us said isomura we couldnt even see what 
direction we were heading were running into problems too thatll 
make them happy 
hoelzer believes he has the advantage of early sea trials because 
the fau sub took a nosedive into mud capsized a canoe and broke 
essential parts at a time when mistakes were expected and adaptation 
was possible 
the top prize is 5000 
theres going to be schools against corporations schools with 
sweat equity up against corporations with supercomputers said 
linskey merrill if theres a guy whose vehicle is very very fast 
who spent tons and tons of money on it he may not win the whole 
prize 
various cash and trophy prizes also will recognize the team with 
the most flair and flamboyance and the team that shows the best 
sportsmanship and fortitude she said 
cal gongwer a 73yearold inventor whose innerspace corp of 
covina calif manufactures propulsion systems for remotecontrol 
robot subs is pushing his knuckle ball as an innovator the round 
ball with wings on the bottom is 5 feet in diameter and made of 
transparent plastic 
the engine of choice seems to be a scubadiving bicyclist both 
of faus pilots are women who are compact enough to fit in the 
2footwide 3foottall chamber 
the knuckle ball is armpowered just for the heck of it 
said gongwers son bob a retired physician and project participant 
lockheed is using a rowing machinetype pushpull propulsion 
method with the human engine lying face down the fau pedaler will 
sit with legs outstretched facing aft the mit power source will be 
lying on his back facing forward 
the rules ban electronic controls and emphasize safety as the top 
priority 
there are developments that will come out of this that will 
contribute to enhancement in the field of underwater vehicles 
submersibles for uses that would include commercial uses for 
research applications and for military applications said linskey 
merrill whether there is an industry out there waiting to produce 
humanpowered submarines for the commercial market i dont know

kurdish rebels on saturday accused iraq of 
razing several towns and forcibly relocating 19000 people in a 
drive to stamp out the kurdish identity and carve a security zone 
along the iranian border 
diplomats and other sources in iraq say the government already 
has moved up to 500000 kurds and destroyed about 3000 villages in 
a major relocation effort over the past few years they say it is 
aimed at cutting off the rebels from sympathizers and breaking up 
the tightknit kurdish clan system 
iraq acknowledges relocating people but denies forcing residents 
to leave 
a kurdish official speaking in northern iraqs city of arbil said 
saturday that kurds in the region have suffered long years of 
backwardness and that the resettlement is a nonpolitical and 
nonpartisan issue 
ahmed abdul qader alnaqshabandi who heads the legislative 
council of the autonomous region said in an interview that the 
relocation is only a communal program aimed at uplifting economic 
and social standards of villagers 
rebels refuse to join the council which was elected on the basis 
of 1974 agreement for limited autonomy for kurds and consider its 
members proiraqi 
the iraqis are pressing ahead with their mass deportation plan 
and theyre getting away with it said a spokesman for the 
patriotic union of kurdistan a leading rebel group wed hoped 
that western government pressure would prevent this happening but 
it hasnt 
the rebel spokesman spoke in a telephone interview from london 
where kurdish leaders are seeking international support he demanded 
anonymity 
according to reports from the kurdistan region of iraq 
government forces dynamited about 2400 homes in the towns of 
twosuram and sengeser and the nearby villages of qadirawa 
madhobizinan soorkanh gelk and mankan the spokesman said he said 
they first forcibly evacuated about 13000 people to settlements 
near the ancient city of erbil 60 miles to the west 
the evacuated area is seven miles northwest of qala diza some 
reports say that citys population of about 200000 kurds also is 
being relocated 
kurdish rebel officials said last week that iraqi tanks had moved 
into qala diza 15 miles west of the iranian frontier to enforce 
the evacuations 
the rebel spokesman said some residents barricaded themselves in 
their homes and called a general strike in an unsuccessful effort to 
resist it was not known if there were casualties 
the rebel spokesman also said troops evacuated the 6000 
residents of dagalah last week 
there was no immediate confirmation of his claims 
he said iraq was trying to create a 50milewide security zone 
along its border with iran and that it hoped to destroy the 
kurdish identity 
iraqs 35 million kurds have been battling for an independent 
homeland for decades the kurdish rebels sided with iran during the 
eightyear iraniraq war 
a short time before both countries agreed to a ceasefire last 
august the iraqis dropped poison gas on the kurdish town of 
halabja killing an estimated 4000 civilians the kurds claim 
thousands more were killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last 
fall 
since the ceasefire went into effect the iraqis have stepped up 
their campaign against the kurds the rebels charge 
the rebel spokesman said iraqis have destroyed 19 religious 
centers and shrines in the region to eliminate any reason for 
kurds to return on pilgrimages

fifteen protesters against the seabrook 
nuclear power plant seeking a day in court got themselves arrested 
saturday on a more serious charge than normal for such 
demonstrations 
we feel fine about that weve been trying to do that for three 
years said lee wheeler a spokesman for the antinuclear group 
clamshell alliance 
twelve adults and three juveniles were arrested shortly after 
730 am as they tried to block traffic at a gate to the stalled 6 
billion plant police said the adults were released on bail or 
personal recognizance and the juveniles were held until their 
parents took them away 
all 15 were charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing an 
offense that carries a maximum penalty upon conviction of a 1000 
fine and a year in jail 
a threeday demonstration last weekend at seabrook resulted in 
734 arrests although most of those arrested some more than once 
were charged only with a criminal trespass violation a violation is 
a summons like a parking ticket that carries a maximum 500 fine 
and does not have to go to trial 
wheeler said the purpose of saturdays blockade was to get 
tougher charges filed so the group could get a court hearing 
this was basically in response to some tv news shows tuesday 
and wednesday where the police etc were saying that people 
wouldnt do this if the charges were more serious wheeler said 
wheeler said the demonstrators hoped to be tried as a group and 
with a jury 
a hearing was scheduled for july 10 in hampton district court 
the seabrook reactor was completed nearly three years ago but 
federal regulators and objections by officials in neighboring 
massachusetts help up issuance of a license for lowpower tests 
until last month 
seabrooks operators had hoped to start the first chain reaction 
last week but wont be able to do so before at least the middle of 
this week three faulty safety valves had to be taken out for 
modification by the manufacturer they have been returned to 
seabrook and were being reinstalled saturday said seabrook 
spokesman ron sher

vice president dan quayle and his family 
took a whitewater rafting trip down north americas oldest river 
saturday after the army corps of engineers lowered the water level 
for a smoother ride 
quayle his wife marilyn and children benjamin corinne and 
tucker put their raft into the new river about 1030 am 
accompanied by guides and three rafts filled with secret service 
agents 
the army corps of engineers informed raft operators that it would 
decrease flow from bluestone dam 40 miles upriver from 14000 
cubic feet per second friday to 800010000 cfs saturday said 
susan hanger who runs songer whitewater in fayetteville 
hell have a kinder gentler ride said hanger adding that 
recent rains also would smooth the course over rapids from cunard to 
fayette station 
the quayles took a shorter trip than most rafters three hours 
instead of four and exited the river about a mile downriver from 
the usual landing the vice president spoke with reporters before 
the trip but not afterward 
quayle remarked on west virginias beauty and mentioned a bush 
administration environmental proposal that could reduce demand for 
the states highsulfur coal 
were going to be submitting clean air legislation and this 
rafting will be in the spirit of clean air he said well get 
out and taste a little bit and have a little fresh air today and 
enjoy the river and the scenery in west virginia 
president bush on monday is expected to propose legislation 
requiring a 10 millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by 
the end of the century to combat acid rain 
quayle reminded of the bills possible impact in an area where 
abandoned coal towns already line the new river laughed then 
backed off of his remark 
i know i shouldnt have mentioned that he said 
gov gaston caperton a democrat and a whitewater rafting 
enthusiast greted quayle at cunard but did not accompany him state 
agriculture commissioner cleve benedict the only republican holding 
statewide office in west virginia went along on the trip 
the new river is at the bottom of a canyon rising to 1000 feet 
the northwardflowing river its name notwithstanding predates 
the glacial era and geologists say that its age is comparable to 
the niles 
the vice president who had been whitewater rafting once in 
wyoming set aside saturday for his family before embarking sunday 
on a threeday trip to central america 
the quayles were clad in shorts and wore life preservers required 
on rafting trips after about 15 minutes of instruction they put 
their raft into the roily waters 
an unexplained onehour delay in the quayles departure caused 
authorities to postpone other rafters launches a group that had 
started its trip upriver at thurmond was forced to tie up for 1 
hours along the river bank and wait until after the quayles took off 
good morning mr vice president some of the rafters shouted 
when the quayles passed them 
other rafters were displeased that the river wasnt at full 
strength 
i was expecting something a little more challenging said 
william bradford of newark del but i understand after all he 
is the vice president 
the us park service made a 45mile stretch of the new river 
part of the national park system in 1978 shortly after the area was 
opened up by the completion of fourlane us 19 over the new river

premier nikolai i ryzhkov on saturday announced 
plans to abolish 18 state agencies slash the number of cabinet 
posts and surrender some power to the republics in the biggest 
government overhaul of the gorbachev era 
president mikhail s gorbachev has been streamlining and 
decentralizing the soviet bureaucracy because he blames it for 
impeding his economic reforms 
the cabinet or council of ministers which ryzhkov heads has 
been widely accused of ruining the economy and slowing the changes 
speaking to a joint session of the nations new twochamber 
legislature the supreme soviet ryzhkov said of the 100 cabinet 
members appointed in 1984 only 10 will remain 
he also told the session broadcast live on staterun radio and 
television that of the 50 key ministries overseeing industries 
construction transport agriculture and defense only 32 would 
remain 
one of those eliminated will be the ministry of light industry 
which oversees production of chronically scarce consumer goods 
ryzhkov a 59yearold technocrat reelected premier on 
wednesday said the remaining ministries in moscow would abandon 
daytoday management of the countrys industries and focus instead 
on longrange planning as well as scientific and technological work 
gorbachev who came to power in 1985 has said his goal is to rid 
soviet society of a halfcentury of topheavy bureaucratic 
management by command epitomized by dictator josef v stalin 
in earlier phases of gorbachevs program ministry staffs were 
cut by thousands and several ministries were consolidated into a 
superagency for agriculture 
in march however the leadership decided to abolish the 
superagency which was blamed for mismanagement of food production 
and distribution that has left some grocery shelves bare 
ryzhkov said some economic management functions will be 
transferred to the 15 soviet republics many of which are 
campaigning for greater control over their affairs 
he mentioned specifically that the ministry of construction 
materials would be abolished and that republics would control 
building supplies several lawmakers have complained that shortages 
of construction materials cause long delays in projects 
despite the proposed reductions two committees will be formed 
one to handle natural and manmade disasters and another to plan 
economic reforms leonid abalkin a prominent economist will handle 
the economic panel 
the government ministries were frequently criticized during 13 
days of debate by the new soviet congress of peoples deputies 
which ended its session friday 
at one point deputy anatoly miloserdny of byelorussia blamed the 
cabinet for shortsightedness that he said led to the 
disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods 
gorbachev urged deputies to grill ministers on why they are 
dragging their feet on reforms he acknowledged complaints that the 
agencies are restructuring very slowly if at all 
we have to find out what is wrong he said 
the soviet union suffers from a budget deficit projected to reach 
162 billion this year inflation estimated last year at 8 percent 
to 9 percent and poverty that affects millions of people 
ryzhkov on saturday announced nominees for the 10 cabinet posts 
that will remain supreme soviet committees are scheduled to hold 
confirmation hearings beginning june 19 
among those nominated to remain in their posts are kgb secret 
police chairman vladimir a kryuchkov and defense minister dmitri t 
yazov 
the full supreme soviet is to reconvene june 26 to vote on the 
nominations and then draft legislation in a session that will last a 
month and 10 days vice president anatoly i lukyanov announced 
in other work saturday the supreme soviet named heads of 14 
committees to oversee such areas as state security law enforcement 
and farming in addition to economic reform 
communist maverick boris n yeltsin was named head of a committee 
on construction and architecture

the inaugural session of the new soviet congress 
may in the end prove more frustrating than elevating for a nation 
that has begun demanding results to match its leaders talk 
frequently contrasted of late with china where there was 
economic reform without political reform the soviet union has made 
dramatic strides in opening its political system to popular 
participation and unrestrained debate 
but one point that debate harped on during the first session of 
the congress of peoples deputies was the failure of mikhail s 
gorbachevs perestroika or restructuring to produce tangible 
improvements in peoples lives 
the soviet union is a superpower with missiles but little meat 
its people have money but nothing to buy giant factories produce 
pollution but to no end for no one wants their shoddy products 
the result is a grinding sort of poverty and frustration bred by 
chronic shortages and compounded by a new national awareness that 
life isnt like that elsewhere and shouldnt be at home whats 
more there is general agreement things are getting worse as 
everyday goods disappear from stores black marketeering flourishes 
and inflation saps peoples savings 
yet the congress after two weeks of mindboggling televised 
criticism that five years ago was hardly expressed around a kitchen 
table for fear of being overheard adjourned on friday leaving no 
particular course for the kremlin to follow no consensus for a new 
program of action 
gorbachev called the meeting the most outstanding event in the 
entire history of the soviet state and said it heralded a new 
stage of perestroika certainly in terms of free expression that 
was true 
but human rights activist andrei d sakharov whose presence as a 
deputy testified to the genuineness of the new democratic spirit 
said on the final day that the congress had failed in its main task 
as he defined it to establish a system of power to overcome 
economic and social problems and put an end to ecological madness 
communist maverick boris n yeltsin who had called on the 
congress to approve at least one program to cure a social ill told 
the supreme soviet legislature on saturday he agreed with sakharovs 
criticism 
we have not been offered a shortterm program economic and 
financial which would lead our country out of the dead end 
yeltsin said 
there have been many cries recently including at the congress 
for the government to import popular consumer goods as a way of 
demonstrating that those who heed gorbachevs pleas to work harder 
and better will have something to buy with the rewards they earn 
without some incentive there seems little reason for people to risk 
breaking from the stagnant environment gorbachev so often rails 
against 
but premier nikolai i ryzhkov who heads the mammoth bureaucracy 
charged with carrying out gorbachevs reforms told the congress the 
state cannot afford to finance what would only be a quick fix 
he revealed the soviet union is carrying a 52 billion debt to 
the west and is spending 20 billion a year to buy technology 
chemicals raw materials and food from abroad after servicing its 
debt he said the nation already is running a 146 billion annual 
deficit in convertible currencies 
his alternative approach announced to the new supreme soviet 
legislature on saturday was to reorganize the bureaucracy for at 
least the third time since gorbachev took power four years ago

the top student at jack yates senior high school 
who has a child and is seven months pregnant delivered the 
valedictory speech saturday despite earlier doubts school officials 
would allow her to do so 
you and i are special carrie mae dixon said told 400 
classmates during commencement ceremonies held at texas southern 
university we made many sacrifices and some of us even went 
against all odds 
miss dixon 18 became a center of controversy in april when an 
article about her for the school paper was killed by principal 
chester smith the article titled against all odds student 
becomes valedictorian despite motherhood detailed miss dixons 
first pregnancy and how she was shuffled among relatives after her 
mother died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings 
smith said the school newpaper article was too personal he cited 
a us supreme court ruling in january 1988 that upheld the right of 
school authorities to censor school newspapers 
miss dixon said she doubted school officials would allow her to 
give the valedictory address since she was pregnant a second time 
but officials later said there was no policy preventing her from 
giving her speech 
the petite student wearing a bright red cap and gown had to 
pause and start her speech over as smith lowered the microphone for 
her 
there were almost 1000 of us that rushed through the halls of 
jack yates senior high school at the sound of the bell in 1985 
she said 
in less than four years over 50 percent have disappeared 
where did they go she asked you and i are special special 
because we didnt give in to drugs alcohol or peer pressure 
miss dixon who shared the stage with other honor students 
including mark nealey her boyfriend and father of her unborn child 
was first to receive her diploma she also was recognized as an 
honorable mention for the award of outstanding graduating girl 
miss dixon attained valedictorian status by maintaing straight 
as in such honors classes as physics calculus and economics she 
plans to attend the university of houston to study chemical 
engineering and has 17500 in scholarships 
before and after the ceremonies miss dixon eluded reporters and 
photographers 
the publicity about her graduation has helped miss dixon 
financially said shuronda robinson editor of the school paper 
people have sent money and offered things i think it helped 
her know that there are still people out there who care about other 
people in this world that everybody makes mistakes shes gotten 
letters from girls who are in her same situation 
and i think her story also lets others know that they can beat 
the odds she said 
student tammi mccall who wrote the censored story said miss 
dixons scholastic achievements belie stereotypes that pregnant 
teenagers cant go far in life 
miss dixon and her daughter 20monthold terrisha keandrea are 
living with her boyfriends family 
nealey a national merit scholar was vice president of the 
graduating class

former us rep pat swindalls attorneys have 
pared by five the 37 allegations of perjury for which he is on trial 
and are preparing to call at least three congressmen to testify 
us district judge richard c freeman ruled friday that the five 
of the 37 alleged statements that gave rise to perjury charges are 
not relevant to the case 
but he did not throw out any of the 10 perjury charges outright 
saying he would take defense motions for dismissal under advisement 
the 32 remaining disputed statements are divided among the 10 
charges 
while the jury took a day off in the 2weekold trial freeman 
also indicated that he personally believes at least some of 
swindalls allegedly perjurious statements were indeed false 
swindall was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in early 
1988 about his 1987 dealings with an undercover agent posing as a 
money launderer and with a swindall associate since convicted of 
money laundering swindall was negotiating to obtain 850000 from 
the agent for construction of his home 
the statements eliminated from the case involved questioning 
about whether two exact terms were used during swindalls money 
discussions narcotic and hiding as it pertained to the 
source of the money 
defense attorney richard hendrix has subpoenaed at least three 
members of congress to testify in the case presumably in an effort 
to refute the prosecution notion that swindall should have been 
familiar with moneylaundering laws the three are rep howard 
coble rnc rep alex mcmillan rnc and rep barney frank 
dmass 
house officials have filed a motion to quash the subpoenas of 
coble and mcmillan which freeman on friday deferred ruling on until 
it becomes obvious they are to be called the coblemcmillan motion 
said that frank is expected to respond separately 
hendrix did not say how many congressional representatives he has 
subpoenaed but he said some have indicated they will testify the 
jury returns monday to begin hearing the defense portion of the case 
swindall a twoterm republican lost his seat in a bitterly 
contested race to democrat ben jones a former actor on televisions 
dukes of hazzard last november after the indictment was 
returned 
his attorneys contend he was duped by friend and associate 
charles lechasney who acted as middleman in the loan deal 
swindall testified before the grand jury that he walked away 
from the money deal after a sept 13 1987 meeting with lechasney 
and the undercover agent 
the evidence is clear he didnt walk away from it freeman 
said in court friday the statement is literally false

a wilder victory on nov 7 would make him the first elected black 
governor in us history at least one black served as governor but 
not as an elected governor for a time in the south during the 
period after the civil war 
his republican opponent will be chosen tuesday in a bitterly 
contested primary from among former us sen paul s trible jr 
former attorney general j marshall coleman and us rep stanford 
e parris 
polls released last week showed the three gop contenders 
neckandneck and each slightly leading wilder in a headtohead 
contest but the democratic ticket has swept all three offices in 
the last two statewide elections including wilders 
precedentsetting victory as lieutenant governor four years ago 
the people of virginia do not want to turn back wilder said 
they know virginia is moving in the right direction they want to 
continue our progress and prosperity 
wilder praised baliles and his predecessor former gov charles 
s robb even though he has publicly feuded with both men on issues 
ranging from tax policy to giving credit for election victories 
at the convention the three men clasped hands and raised them as 
the 5300 delegates and alternates cheered 
robb now a us senator said in a seconding speech for wilder 
that their differences pale by comparison to what those 
republicans are saying about each other he said he might not have 
been elected lieutenant governor in 1977 and governor in 1981 
without wilders help 
baliles who was the target of a coal miners protest at the 
convention said wilder reminds him of the verse of poetry that 
ends paddle your own canoe 
well ive looked out the window of the governors office on 
more than one occasion and sure enough there was doug paddling by 
but he was always nice about it he always waved baliles said 
he said he admires wilder because he knows what he believes in 
and has the courage to stand and be counted 
about 150 labor delegates at the convention stood silently and 
turned their backs to baliles while the governor delivered the 
keynote speech the protest was over the sending of state troopers 
to the southwest mountains where some 1700 members of the united 
mine workers union have been on strike since april against the 
pittston coal group operations 
we think hes turned his back on us by putting at least a third 
of the state police out there escorting coal trucks and harassing 
our people said sam church a convention delegate from wise 
county and former president of the umw 
wilder a grandson of slaves and a former state senator from 
richmond came to the convention unopposed for the nomination a bid 
by state sen daniel w bird jr of wythe drew little support and 
bird dropped out of the contest earlier this year

the chinese communists until his may 1988 release called for 
freedom and peace in his homeland during a memorial mass on saturday 
for the students slain in beijing 
bishop ignatius kung who was released from a chinese prison for 
medical reasons made his comments shortly after the secretary of 
the interior laid a memorial wreath at the statue of liberty as an 
eternal reminder of the cause for which the students died 
in washington 500 to 600 people protested outside the chinese 
embassy and erected a 20foot plaster replica of the statue of 
liberty in a nearby park the statue however was barely visible 
from the embassy because it was largely shielded by tall bushes 
about 200 chinese students and supporters demonstrated in the 
northern new jersey city of morristown under banners with such 
messages as give me freedom or give me death and students in 
beijing we stand on your side 
the two ceremonies in new york marked the second consecutive day

prodemocracy forces would never be forgotten placed the memorial 
wreath on liberty island at a brief saturday morning ceremony 
sadly we come here today to commemorate those who lost their 
lives in the quest for freedom in their own lands said lujan 
we were horrified by the brutal reminder that there are strong 
forces in this world who seek to snuff out the flame of liberty 
lujan standing beneath the statue of liberty thanked the 
students for inspiring americans by erecting the goddess of 
democracy a statue inspired by miss liberty that stood in tiananmen 
square 
later about 100 people filled the transfiguration church in 
chinatown to hear kung deliver his comments 
i am happy to be here but at the same time very sad kung 
said in his sermon which was read by a translator i am happy to 
pray for human rights but sad for the innocent youths who have been 
brutally murdered 
the 88yearold bishop was jailed in 1958 for his refusal to 
renounce papal authority since his release last year kung has 
since been receiving medical treatment in stamford conn 
the death of the chinese young students is a great tragedy in 
chinese history all of you who live in freedom through your 
prayers must support our suffering brethren said kung 
after saying mass the frail bespectacled bishop blessed a 
shrine inside the church set up to beijings tiananmen square 
martyrs a dozen wreaths sent by various groups in chinatown 
surrounded the shrine 
after the mass dozens of parishioners lined up to pray at the 
memorial in the schoolyard adjoining the church prostudent groups 
set up tables to collect donations in the fight for democracy 
there was one pocket of support for the chinese governments 
decision to use military force against the students sara flounders 
a member of the national committee of the workers world party said

we feel its in the interest of the working people and 
oppressed people all over the world to support the chinese 
government she said labeling the student uprising a 
counterrevolutionary development

two faces of the rocky flats nuclear plant were 
presented by its operators and its federal overseers an affidavit 
and internal memos revealed after federal raids shut down the 
facility as unsafe last week 
hazardous wastes were burned illegally in a plutonium 
reprocessing building while it was closed for safety violations the 
affidavit states yet the department of energy paid rocky flats 
managers bonuses each year as rewards for production and management 
a july 1986 energy department internal memorandum said rocky 
flats was in poor condition generally in terms of environmental 
compliance and its permit applications were grossly deficient 
the memo also indicated some of the plants waste facilities were 
patently illegal plutonium triggers are made at the plant 
northwest of denver 
yet an ad for rockwell international the facilitys operator 
appears in the current edition of a metropolitan weekly the 
broomfield enterprise inviting the public to tour the plant 
officials said the tours were the companys method of explaining to 
neighboring communities how the nuclear weapons plant operated and 
why 
the rocky mountain news quoted an unidentified rockwell spokesman 
as saying that the ad was placed before the investigation 
another doe memo written july 14 1986 said favorable news 
media attention had been garnered for rocky flats officials who 
negotiated a cleanup agreement with regulators rather than the bad 
press they might have deserved 
much of the good press we have gotten from the agreement 
has taken attention away from just how really bad this site is 
the memo said 
energy department officials supported the statements of rockwell 
executives about plant safety and performance they allegedly knew 
were false according to the affidavit that was unsealed friday in 
us district court here 
the affidavit was made public after it had been used earlier in 
the week by federal agents to obtain warrants for the raids 
some of rocky flats top managers since 1980 are among the doe 
and rockwell officials named in the affidavit as possible 
coconspirators in violation of hazardous waste laws 
they include energy department officials earl whiteman and 
raymond romatowski as well as rockwell executives dominic sanchini 
and je door but representatives of the department and rockwell 
declined to comment on the affidavit 
it says doe and rockwell officials are suspected of collaborating 
on making low waste estimates at rocky flats they also are accused 
of making false statements regarding waste disposal at the facility 
at that time the plants plutoniumreprocessing facility 
building 771 was supposed to be shut down for four months afer 
three safety inspectors were accidentally exposed to radiation 
but the fbi using infrared cameras during flights over rocky 
flats in december detected burning in an incinerator in building 
771 
meanwhile whiteman and sanchini publicly were saying the 
building totally was shut down 
whiteman and dorr also were accused of misleading regulators in 
1985 by certifying that rocky flats groundwater monitoring system 
complied with federal requirements the affidavit says that 
certification was found to be false and in violation of federal law 
whiteman and other energy department officials were accused of 
claiming that a number of wastes were nonhazardous when in fact 
they were hazardous 
a nov 13 1987 energy department memo by romatowski to other 
department officials advised that the agency should resist the 
efforts of environmental and public health authorities trying to 
clean up rocky flats 
the general accounting office also is conducting an investigation 
into performance bonuses awarded rocky flats managers 
the doe paid bonuses each year ranging from 23 million in 1981 
to 94 million last year to reward rockwell for its production and 
management performance at rocky flats 
in addition to the raid by fbi and epa agents the plant also 
came under fire wednesday from the colorado department of health 
which announced it had found 25 environmental and procedural 
violations at the plant

syrian and christian gunners exchanged 
rocket and artillery fire saturday killing four people and wounding 
12 
arab officials meanwhile sought to halt the fighting and 
reportedly were trying to gain support for a peace plan to end 
lebanons 14year civil war 
a police spokesman said the syrians entrenched in moslem west 
beirut blasted the christian coastline north of beirut with 130mm 
howitzer shells and 107mm rockets 
one round struck a residential district near the port of jounieh 
12 miles north of beirut killing four people and wounding seven he 
said on condition of anonymity 
five other civilians were wounded in a retaliatory barrage on 
west beirut during which christian units under gen michel aoun 
opened up with 155mm howitzers he said 
the latest casualties brought the overall toll to 367 people 
killed and 1432 wounded since the latest round of fighting began on 
march 8 between aouns 20000 forces and allied syrian and druse 
moslem fighters 
the clash began when aouns forces blockaded illegal ports run by 
moslem militias that aoun said cost the state treasury about 100 
million yearly syria responded by blockading the 310squaremile 
christian enclave 
thuds of exploding shells shook the capital as lakhdar ibrahimi 
an arab league envoy shuttled twice between the christian and 
moslem sectors for talks with aoun who heads the christian cabinet 
in lebanons dual government and salim hoss his moslem rival 
the arab league called a ceasefire on may 11 but the fighting 
did not stop the league renewed the call at a summit meeting in 
casablanca morocco may 2326 and appointed a threemember 
committee to devise a peace plan 
but syrian forces kept shelling the christian coastline claiming 
they wanted to prevent iraqi supplies from reaching aoun by sea 
these barrages have drawn occasional retaliation from aouns forces 
ibrahimi an algerian diplomat left for syria later saturday 
the arab committee is comprised of moroccos king hassan ii king 
fahd of saudi arabia and president chadli bendjedid of algeria 
their foreign ministers arrived in baghdad iraq saturday after 
three days of talks in damascus with syrian president hafez assad 
and foreign minister farouk alsharaa who reportedly pledged to 
assist their mission 
syria and iraq the arab worlds traditional rivals are on 
opposite sides of the lebanese civil war 
syria with 40000 troops in northern and eastern provinces as 
well as west beirut is the moslems main supporter iraq supports 
aoun who has vowed to drive the syrians out of lebanon 
the independent beirut daily annahar said the arab foreign 
ministers were soliciting support for a sevenpoint settlement 
proposal 
the plan according to the paper calls for exerting 
international pressure on israel to withdraw its forces from south 
lebanon israel has occupied a selfdesignated security sone 
in south lebanon since 1985 in an effort to stop crossborder 
guerrilla raids 
according to annahar the peace proposal would include the 
deployment of an algerian force along a 75milelong coastal 
stretch from sidon 25 miles south of beirut to tripoli to prevent 
the import and export of illegal goods 
it also calls for lifting all sea land and air blockades

millions of bicycles clog cratered 
streets electric trolleys lumber down treeshaded avenues and dim 
neon signs flicker above holeinthewall bars 
shanghai grinds on after authorities made some arrests and issued 
warnings of tougher action aimed at preventing chinas largest city 
from becoming the new focal point for the prodemocracy movement 
crushed in beijing last week 
the fist of authority has come down less forcefully in shanghai 
than elsewhere but strong enough to stifle the reappearing 
protests security forces have swept through chinese cities in 
recent days arresting scores of students and workers including at 
least 21 in shanghai 
in the last few days protesters wrought havoc on shanghais 
traffic blocking intersections with buses and concrete barricades 
on friday they held a rally in peoples square that drew 50000 
supporters largest anywhere in china since the bloody suppression 
of the democracy uprising june 34 that left at least 3000 dead 
facing virtually no opposition from authorities in shanghai 
which unlike beijing is not under martial law activists seemed 
headed toward shifting the focus of the fight for freedom and 
expanded rights to this city of 12 million 
shanghai mayor zhu rongji gave what was viewed as a conciliatory 
speech thursday urging civic obedience so troops would not be 
called into the city 
but authorities issued a clear warning against further unrest 
we want to sternly warn certain students not to go any 
further on this dangerous road shanghai radio said saturday 
there is a limit to the restraint of the people of shanghai 
there was also a heavy police presence saturday with a motorcade 
of 17 police motorcycles with sidecars and a small convoy of trucks 
carrying workers urging rigid support of the communist party 
swooping through the city 
a major handicap for students propaganda efforts is the lack of 
news about what has happened in the capital 670 miles to the 
northwest 
the government says 23 students were killed but how do we know 
way down here in shanghai asked a 33yearold delivery man 
we know the students say many more were killed than the 
government says but we have no idea whos right a mechanic said 
we dont get any news 
since before last weeks bloody crackdown in beijing provincial 
students had been returning to the countryside to inform the masses 
about the revolution 
but shanghai students have not been particularly energetic in 
spreading the word 
there were scattered posters in shanghai earlier this week 
calling for a general strike but they have largely disappeared 
residents say 
instead shanghai citizens seem to be absorbed in other kinds of 
posters in the city center people stared intently at pictures of a 
bodybuilding contest movie promotions and shoe advertisements 
tacked up along raucous nanjing road 
several clusters of people gathered at peoples square saturday 
to exchange opinions about the previous days mass rally 
im outraged but im very afraid i dont dare speak out a 
research scientist said our media is just communist party 
propaganda we all listen to the voice of america and bbc broadcasts 
every day to hear the truth several people around him nodded 
like all those interviewed in shanghai the scientist insisted 
that his name not be used the chinese government began a new form 
of terror saturday playing foreign news reports on television and 
urging informers to identify chinese who spoke on camera 
about 200 students from shahghais fudan and tongji universities 
held a rally and sitin in front of shanghai police headquarters to 
demand the release of nine labor leaders arrested friday 
if they decided to press charges then they must do so in the 
open but they insist on doing it secretly said a student leader 
from tongji university at the protest 
the arrests appeared to be part of a nationwide campaign to 
create a split between students and workers by cracking down on 
labor authorities undermine a main source of support for the 
student movement 
at fudan university about 90 percent of the students have 
returned to their homes out of fear of troops entering campus to 
arrest students 
along the main path into campus there is an 8foot plastic foam 
model of the statue of liberty made by a neighboring school and 
paraded around the city in marches before the may 20 imposition of 
martial law in beijing 
student leaders were divided earlier this week over whether to 
continue disrupting city life 
we finally agreed to an end to the barricades because the loss 
in production caused by them becomes the peoples burden one 
senior said 
diplomatic sources estimated production fell off in shanghai a 
major industrial base by as much as 50 percent after the barricades 
caused widespread absenteeism at factories 
with arrests stepping up in the last few days it is time for the 
democracy movement to pause and assess its lessons students 
interviewed at fudan said 
most peasants dont understand our 1989 movement at all one 
freshman said we must now concentrate on bringing the peasants 
into play 
sheer fear and a need for quiet reflection are thus likely to 
keep shanghai from becoming the kind of rallying point for democracy 
that beijing was 
the people of shanghai are not cowards said a young bank 
teller at peoples square but we are afraid of getting killed

israeli soldiers opened fire saturday on 
palestinians protesting new identity cards and an 8yearold boy was 
struck in the chest and fatally wounded a doctor reported 
hospital officials said the boy was one of 30 arabs wounded 
during clashes with troops in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
according to residents of the jabaliya refugee camp in the gaza 
strip soldiers in jeeps used loudspeakers to announce that a 
weeklong military curfew on the strip would be lifted to allow 
residents to obtain new computerized identity cards the cards are 
needed for palestinians to work in israel 
khader muranakh a camp resident said about 200 palestinians 
began a protest march shouting slogans against the new cards 
youths started pelting the troops with stones and the soldiers 
then opened fired said united nations nurse muhammad hamudeh 
a doctor at the un relief and works administration clinic in 
the camp said shadi ziad rabah awad 8 was hit in the chest by a 
rubbetcoated metal pellet and died despite an emergency operation 
muranakh said the boy was standing outside his uncles home 
watching the demonstration when troops opened fire from about two 
yards away and wounded him 
an army spokesman confirmed the death but gave the boys age as 
12 the spokesman did not provide the circumstances of the death 
army officials have accused palestinian activists of encouraging 
children to participate in protests to act as shields for older 
organizers and to serve propaganda purposes when they are wounded 
awads death raised to 514 the number of palestinians killed 
since the uprising began 18 months ago twentytwo israelis also 
have been slain in the violence 
arab reports said 28 palestinians including awad were wounded 
in the gaza strip they said two palestinians were wounded in 
clashes in the west bank town of ramallah 
the army announced late saturday that the curfew would remain in 
effect on the jabaliya refugee camp when it is lifted from the rest 
of the gaza strip on sunday 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said in a radio interview that the 
army had succeeded in breaking a boycott ordered by the underground 
leadership of the uprising 
the leadership called on the 17 million palestinians in the 
occupied lands to stop paying taxes tear up identity cards and not 
cooperate with the military government 
the opposite has happened rabin said the individual today 
needs and depends on the civil administration and therefore there 
is no more talk of a popular revolt 
on the other hand we have not been able to prevail over the 
sporadic stone throwings he said

local police have allowed roving bands of armed 
youths to rampage through cities in uzbekistan and attack minority 
turks and their homes according to news reports saturday 
officials said at least 80 people have been killed in the week of 
violence in the central asian republic the number of deaths was 
expected to rise as security forces searched through the rubble of 
hundreds of burnedout homes one report said about 1000 people 
have been injured 
col gen yv shatalin of the interior ministry told soviet 
television that a group of 5000 extremist youth appeared in the 
city of kokand friday afternoon and attacked government office 
buildings and meskhi turk neighborhoods 
for the first time we saw a great number of automatic firearms 
carried by the attackers he said 
soviet interior minister vadim bakatin said the inability of the 
local police to protect the turks was shameful according to the 
newspaper sovietskaya kultura 
uzbekistan interior minister d usatov accused police of looking 
the other way another news report said 
the attacks of the extremists are more frequently taking on the 
character of organized military action said the government 
newspaper izvestia 
bakatin and other officials blamed the rioting on outside 
agitators who they said went to the fergana region of the uzbekistan 
in trucks and buses the area is about 1650 miles southeast of 
moscow 
soviet televisions evening news program vremya reported 
saturday that several thousand youths armed with knives axes and 
clubs drove around kokand in stolen vehicles it said they carried 
out attacks that left 86 houses in flames 11 people dead and 121 
injured a videotape showed burning houses and overturned cars 
the vremya correspondent said the figures were for a twoday 
period but he did not say what the days were or if the death toll 
was in addition to the 80 previously reported 
authorities said at least 9000 security officers have been 
dispatched to stop the violence sovietskaya kultura quoted shatalin 
as saying soldiers had not fired on the mobs 
the communist party newspaper pravda said at least one local 
police officer was among the dead 
the fighting began june 3 between ethnic uzbeks and members of 
the meskhi turk minority who were forcibly resettled in 1944 in the 
fergana valley by the late dictator josef stalin 
uzbek activists have blamed unemployment working conditions in 
the regions cotton fields and poor food supplies for increasing 
local tensions 
the vremya correspondent said 10000 people demonstrated in 
downtown kokand friday demanding that cotton prices be increased a 
local chemical factory be closed and that the meshki turks be 
resettled elsewhere 
meskhi turks who came to moscow seeking a meeting with president 
mikhail s gorbachev blamed poor economic conditions for the unrest 
but they also accused bands of attackers from other areas of 
uzbekistan for starting the arson and killing 
the official press had initially characterized the rampage as 
clashes between the two ethnic groups 
more than 11000 meshki turks are being guarded in emergency 
refugee camps most of their homes have been burned down and the 
rioters were increasingly turning on police stations and government 
officials the reports said 
in one case on june 4 the communist party newspaper pravda said 
police saved the regional party leader who had been captured and 
doused with gasoline by a mob it did not identify the official 
one thing is absolutely clear bakatin was quoted as saying 
evil forces that want to destabilize the situation interfere with 
perestroika are behind these events 
he said he had not determined who was responsible 
izvestia said people had been ordered to temporarily turn in 
firearms but only 87 had done so more than 3000 other guns have 
been seized it said

the united states is sending a military attache to 
interview a japanese monk who reportedly saw american pows in 
vietnamese prison camps recently despite hanois assertions that it 
holds no prisoners 
the buddhist monk iwanobu yoshida 65 has been hospitalized in 
northern japan with what are termed mental and physical problems 
since he was freed in january after 14 years imprisonment in 
vietnam 
in the past week japanese media reports and his daughter have 
said that yoshida shared a cell with americans in the reeducation 
camp where he was held 
the vietnamese embassy in tokyo denied the claims reiterating 
that hanoi holds no prisoners from the war which ended in 1975 
but the us government has for years pressed hanoi for an 
accounting of the 1730 americans listed as missing in action in 
vietnam and 634 missing elsewhere in the war zone 
a us embassy spokesman said saturday that a military attache 
planned to fly to northern sapporo sunday to interview yoshida and 
the information will be relayed to washington for analysis 
the united states sought to interview yoshida earlier but until 
now had been turned down by his daughter keiko takatsuka on 
grounds he was too ill said the embassy spokesman on condition of 
anonymity 
ms takatsuka on saturday said her father had shared a cell with 
three american prisoners for the last six years before returning to 
japan 
my father told me that when he asked them if they were 
americans they nodded ms takatsuka said in an interview from 
her home in sapporo on hokkaido japans northernmost island the 
prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other she said 
a spokesman for the hospital where yoshida is being treated said 
he suffers from mental disorders and a speech impediment and only 
his daughter can understand what he says 
hidenori hareyama a spokesman for shiraishi tokushukai hospital 
on hokkaido said that yoshidas speech is at times incoherent ms 
takutsaka said her father had a stroke three years ago 
yoshida had been a city councilman in mibari on hokkaido before 
he became a monk in 1966 and emigrated to vietnam he set up a 
temple in saigon now ho chi minh city and became a south 
vietnamese citizen in 1973 
he was arrested in 1975 after the takeover of south vietnam by 
communist forces on jan 20 vietnam released him on humanitarian 
grounds after appeals from international human rights groups 
including amnesty international 
ms takatsuka said her father does not remember the names of the 
three held in his cell but said they were still young and 
healthy 
yoshida told her he saw more american pows perhaps more than 10 
before he suffered a stroke 
my father is still afraid somebody will come and get him to 
throw him back in the vietnamese prison she said

about 300 people have crossed into 
namibia from angola the first sign of a massive repatriation under 
terms of a unsupervised independence process for this south 
africanruled territory officials said saturday 
the refugees included both namibians returning home and angolans 
fleeing the angolan civil war said eberhard hoffman a spokesman 
for namibias administrator general 
the un high commission for refugees has registered more than 
than 41000 namibians at camps in angola and zambia who want to 
return home and a unsupervised airlift is to begin monday 
hoffman said the refugees crossed the border friday on foot and 
had no food or possessions other than the clothes they wore they 
were temporarily being housed in tents he said 
when namibias independence process began april 1 some guerrillas 
belonging to swapo the group fighting south african rule entered 
the territory from bases in southern angola fighting with security 
forces ensued until swapo ordered the guerrillas to return to angola 
namibians fled their homeland to angola and zambia over the years 
to escape the 23year bush war between the security forces and the 
southwest africa peoples organization swapo 
under a regional peace treaty signed in december south africa 
agreed to end its 74year rule of namibia in return for cuba 
withdrawing its estimated 50000 troops from angola where they 
fought alongside government forces 
hoffman said he did not know how many angolans fled into northern 
namibia in recent days but he believed they will be granted refugee 
status by the united nations angolans fleeing to namibia did not 
receive refugee status previously 
in recent months there have been reports of sporadic fighting 
but no major battles in the angolan war it was not clear whether 
the angolans leaving their homeland were fleeing a new outbreak of 
fighting or if they simply decided to accompany the returning 
namibian refugees in hopes of receiving un assistance 
angola has been at civil war since 1975 and most of the fighting 
between the marxist government troops and the usbacked unita 
rebels has been in the southern part of the country near the 
namibian border 
unita the national union for the total independence of angola 
was not part of the peace agreement and has continued to fight for a 
powersharing agreement with the angolan government 
under namibias independence plan elections are set for 
november swapo is widely favored to win but they will need a 
twothirds majority in order to control the new government no 
formal date has been set for independence but it will likely be 
early next year

a farmer said to be in financial straits 
killed himself after sheriffs deputies discovered the carcasses of 
41 cows that had been dead in his barn since winter 
richard g turek 42 shot himself in a field on his farm about 
14 miles north of faribault in southern minnesota on wednesday 
morning dr asa graham the rice county coroner said saturday 
sheriff dave schweisthal said turek shot himself in the face with 
a 22caliber rifle after leaving a suicide note which his family 
declined to give authorities tureks body was found by a son 
a deputy was first called to the farm monday night when a 
neighbor complained about a strong odor coming from the property 
he was told there was a dead hog and some dead turkeys and he told 
them to clean them up because of the complaints the sheriff said 
when deputies showed up at the farm again late tuesday with a 
search warrant to enter the barn schweisthal said he kind of 
hung his head later during the course of night he seemed fine and 
asked what would happen 
authorities explained that he might face misdemeanor charges 
related to the dead cows in the barn but tried to reassure the 
farmer that he wouldnt have to go to jail the sheriff said 
turek told the deputies his cows had become sick over the winter 
and died despite his efforts to treat them but offered no 
explanation about why he left their bodies in the barn the sheriff 
said 
four hours after the deputies left tureks family reported he 
had shot himself 
it doesnt make a lot of sense he put a crop in this year the 
crops look good schweisthal said adding that turek and his 
family have had a tough go of it financially 
he was trying to get back on his feet farming 
schweisthal said there are still some unanswered questions that

official usplo meeting in the tunisian capital 
i ask the president and the american administration what are

why is there in the minds of the americans two weights and two 
measures when it is a question of rights of palestinians under the 
occupation and in other regions of the world he added

condemned israels crackdown in the territories while ignoring

the last ashes of union martyr joe hill 
were scattered saturday at a cemetery where five unionized miners 
had lain in unmarked graves since being gunned down at a coal mine 
nearly 62 years ago 
its high time you got back among your own people again said 
carlos cortes a poet with the industrial workers of the world union 
in chicago as he scattered hills ashes over the graves 
hill was an organizer for the iww one of the earliest unions 
whose members were also called wobblies 
a granite marker with the names of the slain miners and of a 
sixth miner who lies in a family plot in louisville colo was 
unveiled in the green neatly mowed cemetery about 20 miles 
northwest of denver 
the dead who were among 500 striking miners accompanied by wives 
and children were killed at the columbine mine on nov 21 1927 by 
state militiamen and mine guards using machine guns and rifles the 
strike was organized by the iww 
a marker commemorating the columbine massacre was unveiled 
saturday on colorado highway 7 about a mile south of the old

a grocer in salt lake city where hill had been organizing workers 
supporters said the mining industry framed hill who maintained his 
innocence to the end 
at his last request his body was cremated after a chicago 
funeral and on may day of 1916 his ashes were divided and scattered 
in many states except utah where he said he wouldnt be caught 
dead

the national archives in washington through a postal error and 
remained there another seven decades last fall the archives 
returned them to the iww 
hill is best known to many modern americans through the ballad 
joe hill which folk singer joan baez sang at the woodstock 
festival in 1969 one stanza runs from san diego up to maine in 
every mine and mill where working men defend their rights its 
there youll find joe hill 
during a general strike in 1927 the columbine mine was the only 
one operating strikers and some family members went there nov 21 
to try to persuade miners to join them 
rocks were hurled back and forth before a miner climbed up on a 
closed gate and yelled come on he was hauled down by police 
and beaten 
pickets surged forward and burst through the gate but were met 
by withering gunfire from militiamen and guards who had at least 
two machine guns according to historians and witnesses

spanudakhis 34 of lafayette frank kovich of erie jerry davis 
21 of frederick mike vidovich 35 of erie were buried in a plot 
at the lafayette cemetery bought by the wobblies

chinas bloody crackdown on students demanding 
more democracy has sent shivers of fear through hong kong and macao 
british and portuguese territories to be turned over to china by 
the end of this century 
lydia dunn a member of hong kongs executive council cabinet 
said saturday that britains decision to let only certain categories 
of hong kong residents resettle in britain would divide the colony 
she said britain has a moral obligation to give a home of last 
resort to all of hong kongs 325 million people who are entitled 
to british passports a vast majority of hong kongs people are 
chinese 
the colony is to be returned to china in july 1997 under an 
agreement signed in 1984 
in lisbon president mario soares said portugal will stand by an 
accord signed with china on macao a portugese enclave in southern 
china near hong kong 
under a 1986 agreement portugal will cede macao which has a 
population of about 500000 to china by dec 20 1999 
in both the british and portuguese accords china promises to 
allow the two territories to maintain democratic structures and 
mixed capitalistsocialist economies for at least 50 years after the 
transfer of sovereignty 
soares expressed concern over the military supression of 
prodemocracy groups in china in which hundreds of people were 
killed the portugese news agency lusa reported 
it said in a statement to the people of macao soares said a 
climate of liberty democracy and tolerance is needed for economic 
progress and social justice 
thousands of people in hong kong and macao have joined 
demonstrations protesting the violence in china 
in talks last week between hong kong governor david wilson and 
british prime minister margaret thatcher mrs thatcher rejected 
proposals to give the right of resettlement to all hong kong 
residents 
london newspapers reported mrs thatchers government was 
prepared to admit up to 250000 hong kong residents mainly current 
and retired civil servants and leading businessmen 
hong kongs lawmaking legislative council declared after a 
meeting friday that britain has a fundamental moral duty to give 
all residents entitled to british passports the right to resettle in 
britain 
mrs dunn said of the category system we believe it would be a 
disservice at this time when there is such unity to separate the 
community into the haves and the havenots 
she said britain may decide to give out x number of 
passports on some kind of categorization system but the rest will 
continue to demand their rights 
londons guardian newspaper reported hong kong is prepared to 
offer asylum to political refugees from china 
it quoted geoffrey barnes hong kongs secretary for security as 
saying screening procedures have been established at at the border 
with chinas guandong province even though it is recognized that 
this move will add to the growing tensions between hong kong and 
beijing 
barnes was in london for talks british officials 
the guardian said barnes stressed that so far there have been no 
requests for asylum among the handful of chinese who cross illegally 
into hong kong daily the newspaper said that in the past such 
illegal immigrants were sent back to china within 24 hours 
antichina demonstrations were reported saturday in portugal and 
in rome 
portuguese newspapers said hundreds of university students held 
protest rallies and student leaders at coimbra university declared a 
period of mourning until june 14 for the people killed in chinas 
martiallaw crackdown 
in rome student representatives delivered to the chinese embassy 
a petition they said was signed by 12000 people condemning the 
massacre of prodemocracy desmonstrators in bejing 
they said the petition also denounced the witchhunt under way 
to seize the leaders of the beijing demonstrations

a hightech navigation satellite 
designed to tell us and allied military forces where they are 
within 50 feet anywhere on the globe on land sea or in the air 
rocketed into orbit saturday 
the threestage delta 2 rocket finally made it on the sixth 
launch attempt bad weather wiped out four tries and the fifth was 
aborted at the last second when an engine valve failed to open the 
valve was replaced 
the delta 2 blasted off its launch pad right on schedule at 630 
pm and left a fiery trail in a clear sky as it darted over the 
atlantic ocean 
the air force reported that the 12storytall rocket had 
performed flawlessly in launching the navstar satellite into an 
initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11000 miles 
above the earth 
we had normal spacecraft separation everything appears to have 
gone extremely well with todays launch said lt col ron rand 
the air force launch commentator 
on tuesday an onboard motor is to fire to shift the satellite 
into a circular orbit about 11000 miles up 
the 30 million rocket carried a 65 million navstar global 
positioning system satellite which could enable military units such 
as ships planes submarines and tanks to determine their location 
within 50 feet and in some cases to within 10 feet 
guided by the satellite a submarine could unleash a nuclear 
missile to strike within a few dozen feet of its target a stealth 
bomber could sneak up on its mark without turning on telltale radio 
or radar 
the satellite effective in any kind of weather also was 
expected to keep track of military units speed within a fraction of 
a mile per hour and the precise time within a millionth of a second 
american and allied military users would receive information from 
a coded channel civilian users also with access to the satellite 
system would monitor an open channel providing them with a position 
accuracy of 300 feet 
the 3675pound navstar gps contains an atomic clock with an 
error rate of one second every 300000 years 
the satellite is the second of 21 upgraded navstars that the air 
force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992 giving 
anyone anywhere in the world 24hour access to the positioning 
information 
the first advanced navstar was launched aboard the maiden flight 
of the delta 2 on feb 14 
seven earliermodel navstar satellites are orbiting the earth 
the new model has more power and improved systems and has added the 
coded military channel

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski still 
smarting from his communist partys stunning electoral defeat 
received promises saturday of economic assistance from britain 
he was greeted at the start of his twoday visit by 
prosolidarity demonsrators who demanded he resign 
prime minister margaret thatcher after a 3hour meeting with 
jaruzelski promised economic aid to encourage progress on the 
path of democracy and reform according to a statement issued by 
mrs thatchers office it said the measures include a 775 million 
annual contribution to a managerial fund to train poles in a more 
marketoriented economy 
british sources said the promised help fell short of jaruzelskis 
hopes for new direct credit lines 
supporters of solidarity the free union movement that won scores 
of victories in sundays election demonstrated outside the polish 
embassy and draped a statue with banners in solidaritys red and 
white colors 
jaruzelski commented on the election in an interview with 
britains channel 4 television network 
we went into the election as a very fragmented front in 
contrast to solidarity he said 
perhaps because we are burdened by a kind of complex of guilt 
for so far not having sufficiently applied all sorts of democratic 
procedures we wanted to be superdemocratic superpluralist he 
added 
jaruzelski speaking polish with his remarks translated into 
english also said the reforms are irreversible and were going to 
carry on with them 
the statement from mrs thatchers office said she told

the arrests came as authorities intensified a propaganda campaign 
that blamed troublemakers and counterrevolutionaries for 
confrontations last weekend in which the peoples liberation army 
killed hundreds of unarmed citizens in beijing 
the moves were further proof that hardliners engaged in a power 
struggle with moderates have gained control of the government the 
reemergence friday of 84yearold leader deng xiaoping with other 
aging revolutionaries served to bring the point home 
on saturday troop trucks with loudspeakers drove through central

student commander in the square during the violence june 24 
mayor chen xitong of beijing meanwhile ordered security forces

in government reports 
cai ling who identified herself as the students chief commander 
from june 2 to june 4 said in an audio recording broadcast on the

executioners were the soldiers of the 27th army 
i think im the most qualified to talk about it and its my 
responsibility to tell everyone the truth ms ling said through 
an interpreter 
she denied official chinese government reports that only 
soldiers not students were killed in tiananmen square a week ago 
then she described the confrontation saying many of the students 
didnt expect violence 
some students still had hopes in the government and in the 
soldiers they thought at most that they would be carried away 
they were tired and returned to their tents to sleep 
then the tanks made pancakes out of them i dont know the 
total number of dead but the members of the independent workers 
union on the outside they stood their ground and now theyre all 
dead 
after students left the tanks and all their personnel carriers 
flattened the tents with the bodies inside then they poured 
gasoline over the remains and burned them she said 
thousands of students joined by workers and others had 
virtually paralyzed chinese government operations in tiananmen 
square for several weeks before soldiers took back the area on june 
3 estimates of the number of people killed range up to 3000 
cbs news said it had obtained the tape recording from a secret 
location

sen lloyd bentsen said saturday he plans to 
introduce legislation that would allow older americans to earn more 
money while holding on to more of their social security earnings 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee said his bill 
would increase both the amount of earnings a social security retiree 
can have with no reduction in benefits as well as reducing the rate 
of reduction for those who earn over the limit 
under his proposal a person who earned 15000 in additional 
income over their social security benefit would be allowed to retain 
almost 800 more in social security benefits than under the present 
law said the texas democrat 
under the current social security earnings test those 70 and 
older are eligible for full benefits without regard to earnings 
but those under 70 are considered retired and eligible for full 
benefits only if their earnings are lower than a specified exemption 
level 
in 1990 the maximum a retiree aged 65 to 69 could earn without 
suffering a reduction in social security benefits will be 9360 
under present law said bentsen he would boost that to 10620 
bentsen said that under his plan a person age 65 to 69 earning 
15000 and receiving 8000 in social security benefits would lose 
1095 in benefits next year compared with 1880 under existing 
law 
retirees now typically lose all benefits when they have earnings 
in excess of 34000 under the bentsen plan a person with 8000 
in social security benefits would have to earn almost 36000 before 
losing them all 
aides estimated that at least 600000 social security 
beneficiaries would benefit from the changes proposed by bentsen

contractors working for the department of housing 
and urban development systematically embezzled millions of dollars 
the government should have received from homes sold after 
foreclosure the new york times reported in its sunday editions 
the newspaper said private escrow agents took the money with 
little fear of recrimination from the reagan administration 
hud inspector general paul a adams has been ordered by hud 
secretary jack kemp to conduct investigations in denver houston 
new orleans los angeles and washington the newspaper said 
there are several investigations andor prosecutions around the 
country in which the loss to hud or the funds allegedly appropriated 
to hud exceed 1 million each said assistant us attorney gary 
p jordan of baltimore who is handling a maryland case 
in that case an escrow agent marilyn harrell has been dubbed 
robin hud by federal investigators because she told agents that 
she diverted as much as 55 million to charity the newspaper said 
the federal investigation the times reported is separate from a 
congressional inquiry into allegations that influencepeddling at 
the department allowed more than a dozen former reagan 
administration officials to benefit from housing programs meant for 
the poor 
the washington post on saturday reported that the head of the 
housing departments washington office and three of her assistants 
were placed on administrative leave last week pending a review of 
charges that harrell used hud money to buy 20 homes and 40 
automobiles for the poor 
the post said senior hud officials estimated cost to the 
government by alleged mismanagement at the washington office at 10 
million 
this could never have gone on if they were doing their jobs 
right harrell told the times 
in texas the inquiry has led to the indictment of reba louise 
lovell 36 who is accused of embezzling 25 million from the sale 
of 55 governmentowned private homes in the dallas area 
the 79count indictment against ms lovell accused her of trying 
to hide her activities by depositing sales proceeds in local banks 
in amounts less than 10000 so that they would not be reported to 
the federal government 
the homes in texas were sold over a fourmonth period last year 
and sold for between 15000 to 80000 each in the dallas area 
including cedar hill keller and fort worth 
hud employs private escrow agents throughout the nation to handle 
paperwork and to transfer the money from the sales of private homes 
and other government properties to government accounts the homes 
being sold by the government have been obtained because the owners 
default on their hudinsured mortgages 
after a home is resold an escrow agent is supposed to transfer 
the money to hud minus a small commission often between 50 to 
200 the times reported 
in many instances investigators told the newspaper hud 
officials failed to notice that the money from the sales was not 
transferred 
one investigator told the times the laxity of oversight by hud 
was frightening nobody noticed nobody cared that the money wasnt 
coming in these private agents apparently felt after a while they 
had carte blanche to keep it

rebels were killed when they were trapped by an army unit in a

when president bush visited china four months 
ago he declined to emphasize human rights issues now faced with 
repression there on a grand scale he is making it a focus of his 
china policy 
bush told an east room news conference we have to speak out in 
favor of human rights we arent going to remake the world but we 
should stand for something 
he also defended the us decision to harbor chinas most famous 
dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi in the us embassy in 
beijing saying its awful hard when a man presents himself a 
person who is a dissident and says his life is threatened to turn 
him back 
that isnt one of the premises on which the united states was 
founded bush added at the thursday night news conference 
fang is now enjoying the us hospitality he was unable to claim 
last february when he was invited to be a guest of the president at 
dinner in beijing 
on the final night of a threeday visit to china bush hosted a 
texasstyle barbecue for chinese leaders in a beijing hotel but 
fang who has spoken out repeatedly against humanrights abuses in 
china was barred from attending by chinese police 
bushs protests did not come until the next day amid some foot 
shuffling by the administration over who actually invited the 
dissident to the ushosted event the white house or the embassy 
staff 
the presidents slowness of response in the incident and his 
failure to stress the human rights issue either in public speeches 
or in private meetings with chinese senior leader deng xiaoping and 
prime minister li peng drew criticism from some quarters 
it also evoked comparisons with his predecessor former president 
reagan who often used public forums in communist countries to speak 
out forcefully on human rights 
bush in part played down the issue during his visit so as not 
to offend top chinese officials he has a personal relationship with 
many of them and he also has cited his familiarity with the chinese 
sensitivity to criticism from outside on internal matters 
however any constraints bush may previously have felt about 
denouncing humanrights abuses in clear terms were washed away with 
the bloodshed of the past week in tiananmen square 
his spokesman said friday keep in mind that the government has 
murdered many many of its citizens we have had an incredible 
upheaval in that country 
spokesman marlin fitzwater added things are not going back to 
normal soon or in a quick fashion a situation has been put in 
effect in china that is going to have an influence on that country 
and on their relations with all countries of the world for a 
considerable period of time 
as for the president the personal relationships he established 
with senior chinese leaders over the years since he served there as 
us envoy in 197475 have been of little use to him in the current 
crisis 
as he told his news conference he put in a call to chinese 
leaders but the line was busy 
fitzwater on friday disclosed that the leader bush had been 
trying to reach was deng xiaoping himself we were just informed 
the call would not go through fitzwater said 
the call remains in place and of course now its public 
im sure chinese officials have read about it and so forth the 
spokesman added

former interior secretary james watt denies he 
used his relationship with former cabinet colleague samuel pierce to 
sway the selection of federally subsidized housing projects for 
developers who paid him as a consultant 
watt said friday he never asked secretary pierce to do anything 
that would embarrass him or me during meetings with the 
thenhousing secretary in connection with a project to renovate a 
lowincome maryland housing development 
i left his office with no commitments from him other than that 
he would check into it said watt adding that his conduct was 
moral ethical and effective 
the project was later financed under the department of housing 
and urban developments section 8 moderate rehabilitation program 
the program came under congressional scrutiny in april when 
current hud secretary jack kemp suspended funding and criticized it 
as being riddled with favoritism mismanagement and 
influencepeddling 
kemps action followed release of an inspector generals 
investigative audit which revealed several former hud and other 
government officials had assisted public housing authorities and 
developers in obtaining grants to renovate or repair subsidized 
housing for lowincome families 
kemp has restored 1989 funding for the program and issued new 
guidelines on june 1 
while in government mr watt often belittled federal programs 
to assist the poor and the less fortunate he spoke of the dangers 
of being lured by the crumbs of subsidies entitlements and 
giveaways said rep tom lantos dcalif in opening fridays 
hearing of the house government operations subcommittee on housing 
and employment 
yet watt apparently decided to take advantage of them lantos 
said his subcommittee is one of several congressional panels 
investigating the program 
watt described a fee sharing arrangement with phoenix 
associates a group headed by joseph strauss a former special 
assistant to pierce watt and phoenix were paid 300000 as 
consultants to developer judith siegels landex corp on a project 
to renovate 312 units at the kingsley park apartments in essex md 
this project came into existence because of influencepeddling 
by you lantos charged a much more worthy project may not have 
come into existence because they didnt have the good fortune to 
hire you 
the fact remains you were able to do something because of your 
prior cabinet relationship with sam pierce said rep barney 
frank d mass in a sometimes rancorous exchange with watt 
people had to pay to get influence on their behalf frank 
said 
im the messenger you dont need to badmouth the 
messenger watt retorted 
youre much more than a messenger frank replied you are a 
great critic of the established ways but when the chance to make 
169000 came your way that did not seem to motivate you the 
balance of 131000 went to phoenix associates at watts request 
watt also testified he received 20000 and 100000 in 
consultant fees from similar arrangements with the phoenix group on 
projects in new jersey and puerto rico 
watt said he met on two occasions with pierce in early 1985 in 
connection with the projects and had several conversations with 
three other hud officials deborah gore dean a special assistant 
to pierce silvio dibartolomeis and maurice barksdale who both 
served as assistant secretary for housing during pierces tenure 
watt resigned as former president reagans interior secretary in 
october 1983 pierce is the sole cabinet secretary to remain with 
reagan through both his terms as president 
however watt said he was not aware when he met with dean that 
pierce had set up a threeperson panel in the department including 
dean to select projects for mod rehab funding 
dean and debartolomeis are scheduled to testified before lantos 
panel next week

the governments main jobtraining program is 
providing more services to people who already have skills while 
shortchanging those who need training the most federal auditors 
conclude in the latest report critical of the program 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
also said friday in a report that too little attention is paid to 
remedial education needs of high school dropouts in the system set 
up under the job training partnership act 
in addition gao questioned jtpa programs that pay for onthejob 
training for lowskill positions saying in most cases it appears 
the government is paying wage subsidies to employers who are 
shirking their responsibilities to provide worthwhile training 
jtpa has not targeted those with the greatest need for 
employment and training services the gao said the less 
jobready were receiving services that were less intensive than 
those provided to the more jobready 
still the agency said the job training partnership act was 
proving far more effective than previous federal training programs 
the gao study requested by the house education and labor 
committee reviewed services provided by 63 of the 600 regional 
service delivery areas set up under the 1983 legislation 
sponsored by vice president dan quayle then an indiana senator and 
sen edward m kennedy dmass more than 10 billion has been spent 
on the system in the past six years 
the agencys findings were similar to those reached by an 
advisory committee that monitors the act and by a senate 
subcommittee led by sen paul simon dill which held extensive 
hearings last year 
both simon and the bush administration have proposed amending the 
program and their proposals appear to answer most of the recent 
criticisms which focus largely on a failure of programs to target 
those most in need of training and a failure to shape programs to 
individual needs 
among the gaos principal findings were 
those most needing extensive skill training were least likely to 
get it 
some 37 percent of those eligible for job training partnership 
act programs are high school dropouts but only 27 percent of the 
participants are dropouts 
the systems programs currently serve roughly equal proportions 
of clients who are job ready and who need extensive skills 
training this suggests that nationwide the program is not 
targeting services the study said 
about 43 percent of onthejob training contracts were for lower 
skills occupations such as custodians and dishwashers in many 
instances onthejob training contracts appeared to provide wage 
subsides to employers gao said 
while such training may be appropriate for certain individuals 
much of it appeared to be excessively long 
the gaos recommendations matched many of those suggested by the 
administration simon and the jtpa advisory committee including 
that spending formulas be rewritten to emphasize training for those 
most in need of skills gao expanded on those suggestions by saying 
more extensive training for promising occupations also should be a 
major goal 
the congressional agency acknowledged such an approach likely 
would reduce the number of people served by the federal program 
which now provides services to just 6 percent of the eligible 
population 
because more intensive training services are more costly fewer 
people are likely to be served under jtpa if such services are 
offered to each participant the gao said 
included in the amendments being considered by congress is a 
requirement that the job training partnership act system coordinate 
its programs with other federal state and local education and 
welfare programs

thousands of americans appear to have fled 
china during the past week spurred by the savage crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators and the advice of secretary of state 
james a baker iii that all us citizens should depart 
according to figures released friday by state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler slightly more than 1500 americans 
remained in the nation of 1 billion 
us officials had estimated that about 8800 us citizens were 
in the country prior to last weeks violence in which hundreds of 
demonstrators were killed by chinese troops 
ms tutwiler described beijing as still an armed camp 
the white house on friday denounced the chinese governments call 
for reprisals against the demonstrators and stressed that 
authorities there had murdered many many of its citizens 
president bush who placed a call to chinese leader deng xiaoping 
earlier in the week but was unable to get through had not heard 
back from deng by friday evening 
the phone call remains placed and well see if he returns our 
call presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
an administration source familiar with intelligence estimates 
said the number of chinese troops in and around the capital city had 
grown to about 340000 from 200000 estimated earlier in the week 
deng appeared in public friday for the first time since may 16 to 
attend a ceremony at which he saluted military leaders for carrying 
out the crackdown on the counterrevolutionaries who had 
occupied beijings tiananmen square until last weekends military 
assault 
ms tutwiler said dengs reappearance did not settle the question 
of who is in charge in china nor does it clarify who bears 
responsibility for ordering the crackdown 
we think that its a very clouded situation and we arent in a 
situation to judge at this time to see who is in charge of what 
she said to be perfectly honest it seems to me that that 
would be something the chinese should be telling us versus us 
trying to sit back and guess 
said fitzwater you can watch television and see who the 
government is but in terms of individual actions and motivations 
we dont know 
but he added that i dont think anyone doubts that deng and 
prime minister li peng are now in charge of the overall government 
in beijing 
fitzwater used some of the strongest language yet to express us 
condemnation of the military actions against unarmed civilians 
keep in mind that the government has murdered many many of its 
citizens said fitzwater things are not going back to normal 
soon or in a quick fashion 
he noted calls for reprisals were being announced over the 
loudspeakers in the public squares in beijing 
reprisals are repugnant we certainly watch this situation with 
grave concern fitzwater said 
bush suspended military sales to china on monday but has 
refrained from economic sanctions saying he does not want to cause 
hardship for the chinese people 
ms tutwiler said friday there are approximately 500 americans 
left in beijing including 150 to 200 journalists and 116 us 
embassy personnel the remainder are business people and tourists 
she said 
between 50 and 100 amercians are in tianjin near beijing and 
the embassy has organized a bus caravan to return them to the 
capital the spokeswoman said 
she said 10 dependents of us government personnel are left in 
china and will be leaving soon and no american students remain at 
beijing university one of the rallying points of the prodemocracy 
movement

internal divisions among palestinians and 
israelis have been magnified by 18 months of bloodshed in the 
occupied lands and threaten to paralyze peace efforts 
leaders on both sides predict that unless political progress is 
made soon the violence will grow and destroy a historic opportunity 
for arabisraeli negotiations 
we are at a turning point either to get a political solution 
or resort to more violence said said kanaan a palestinian 
businessman who supports the palestine liberation organization we 
are waiting to see if we can reap all that we have planted in the 
past 18 months 
at least 512 palestinians have been killed and more than 8000 
wounded in the uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
which began its 19th month friday twentytwo israelis have been 
slain 
both societies have been polarized and advocates of violence are 
becoming more active 
palestinian militants insist only a violent struggle can lead to 
their own independent state 
we are exposed to a lot of pressure to resort to violent 
means kanaan told the associated press this is growing mainly 
among the lower cadres of the plo and the population because the 
israelis are pushing us so much against the wall 
on the israeli side prime minister yitzhak shamir speaks of 
harsher measures to crush the uprising and jewish settlers are 
attacking palestinian villages a 13yearold girl was killed in a 
recent raid 
leftists by contrast grow more vocal in demands for talks with 
the plo and formation of a palestinian state both taboo in israel 
amos oz a prominent leftist writer said extremism including 
vigilante attacks by settlers could destroy israel 
we dont want the nation to be ripped apart but under no 
circumstances will we acquiesce in the transformation of our country 
into a monster he told an audience of peace activists 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said in a telephone 
interview if both sides lose control completely the situation 
can deteriorate and we can have more violence 
shamir faces increasing pressure in his conservative likud bloc 
to abandon plans for elections in the occupied lands that would 
choose palestinian delegates to negotiate with israel 
shamir has said he will resign if likud rejects the plan at its 
convention next month 
mainstream plo officials have conditionally accepted the 
elections as a first step toward negotiating a permanent settlement 
but militants reject any compromise 
i think only the continuation of the uprising will bring us 
liberation said sufian khatib a jerusalem physician whose views 
have been linked to those of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine a radical prosyrian faction of the plo 
the only obstacles are the compromises the plo leadership is 
making he said the plo must focus its efforts only on the 
uprising and its continuation 
moderates say the uprising is a means of forcing israel to 
negotiate israel has refused contact with the plo which it defines 
as a terrorist organization 
israel will find no alternative but to talk with the plo

will be forced to approach us as a people with a leadership and 
rights

the first meeting of the congress of peoples 
deputies quickly became an outlet for a national catharsis with 
representatives of the soviet people pouring out anger and 
grievances pent up for generations 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs tolerant hand the 
congress has been purging soviet society of its devils reexamining 
history from the rostrum and demanding answers no one dared demand 
before in public 
just a year ago at the communist party conference observers 
were surprised by the candid criticism from littleknown delegates 
and frank arguments between senior party officials some of which 
were even shown on television 
but from the opening moments of this congress which has been 
broadcast live to a rapt nation except for two private sessions the 
horizons stretched again this debate has been broader and more 
pointed than anything seen in a public forum in this country in 
living memory 
each one of us wants to talk out an ocean of emotion said 
deputy konstantin d lubenchenko 
the result has been a tidal wave of words day after day for 
nearly two weeks the peoples representatives most of them chosen 
in competitive elections have talked openly sometimes heatedly 
sometimes even shouting and their voices are heard throughout the 
land 
some of the criticism has been by deputies playing to their 
constituents complaints about the miserable roads in siberia the 
disappearance of refrigerators the poor health care 
on occasion the talk has even been personal 
gorbachev himself who remains largely off limits to the 
increasingly frank official press was compared by one deputy to 
napoleon who fearing neither bullets nor death led the nation 
to victory but who owing to sycophants and his wife transformed 
the republic into an empire 
you can put me to death but i fear this path said leonid i 
sukhov a driver from kharkov who promised the president his vote 
but warned you too are incapable of avoiding the adulation and 
influence of your wife 
never before in history he said have the rich and the 
poor sat at the same table the former eating chicken the latter 
licking their own fingers what kind of perestroika is this 
but deputies also have challenged the historical tenets on which 
the union of the 15 soviet socialist republics is based and have 
demanded the communist party surrender its legal monopoly on power 
until now the sanctity of the union and oneparty rule were not 
open to question 
up to now in our history books we have said estonia latvia 
and lithuania voluntarily joined the soviet union and that it was a 
popular revolution there was no violence and it was a declaration 
of free will said historian roy medvedev this is a lie 
lithuanian prosecutor egidius v bichkauskas charged the three 
independent baltic states actually were handed to the soviet union 
as the soviets and the germans secretly carved up the lands that lay 
between them in 1939 
as a result of this pact sovereign lithuania and the other 
baltic republics were occupied and incorporated into the soviet 
union losing their independent statehood bichkauskas noted 
soviets have been taught the three republics overthrew their 
fascist rulers in popular uprisings in 1940 and were then occupied 
by the nazis and liberated by the red army at the end of the war 
gorbachev said he could hardly believe the revisionists account 
but he agreed to a congressional investigation to determine the 
truth 
tamaz v gamkrelidze a university professor demanded the 
congress condemn the annexation of the independent democratic 
georgian republic by the red army in 1921 saying it violated a 
1920 treaty agreed to by soviet founder vladimir i lenin the 
congress did not act on his complaint but gamkrelidze gained a 
national forum for a longsuppressed view 
the inquisitive spirit of the congress already has proved 
contagious after the first week of debate an official newspaper 
exposed the governments 27year coverup of how soldiers opened 
fire on strikers in the southern russian city of novocherkassk 
secretly buried the bodies of 20 victims and repaved the street to 
hide the blood 
the account published by komsomolskaya pravda the newspaper of 
the communist youth league was accompanied by a commentary signed 
by three congress deputies saying it was fitting to report details 
of the longsecret affair during the congress first session

a federal court has ordered the labor 
department to conduct a new review of the cancer risks of exposure 
to formaldehyde and also to reconsider its decision not to protect 
the earnings of workers disabled by the gas 
in a decision issued friday the us court of appeals here said 
the departments occupational safety and health administration has 
failed adequately to explain its determination that the exposure 
limit for formaldehyde it set in 1987 made the cancer risk 
insignificant 
the court also said osha had offered a feeble explanation of 
its decision not to include in its standard for formaldehyde 
exposure provisions guaranteeing workers will be paid full wages and 
retain seniority rights during rehabilitation from any illness 
linked to the substance 
the court ruling in a suit filed by several unions upheld 
oshas decision not to require employers to provide annual medical 
examinations to workers who are exposed to formaldehyde a colorless 
gas that when mixed with other materials has a number of 
applications in industry and is found in numerous construction and 
consumer products 
simple monitoring of employees who are exposed to the substance 
and medical checkups if they develop skin or eye irritations and 
other symptoms caused by formaldehyde exposure are enough to protect 
workers the court said 
also upheld was the oshaset exposure action level at which 
employers are required to provide workers with training protective 
clothing and other measures for protection the unions failed to 
show that lowering that level would significantly enhance worker 
safety the court said 
an osha spokesman said agency officials were reviewing the 
decision and had no immediate comment 
osha revising a 1972 standard in 1987 set a maximum permissible 
exposure level of 1 part per million of formaldehyde during an 
eighthour workday and set the action level at 05 ppm 
a number of unions challenged the standard saying osha should 
have set a far more stringent exposure limit 
the court in returning to the labor department the question of 
cancer risk questioned the formula used by the department to 
extrapolate the cancer risk to humans from the risk found in animal 
studies 
the court also dismissed oshas contention that it did not 
include provisions protecting the earnings and seniority of workers 
disabled by formaldehyde because it did not believe those workers 
could ever return to their old jobs 
the court said in other instances the agency had provided 
earnings protection until a disabled worker was retrained for 
another job citing provisions applying to coal dust and lead 
exposure 
when it released the revised standard in 1987 osha said it would 
help protect 22 million workers at an annual cost to industry of 
more than 60 million employers who cannot reduce formaldehyde to 
acceptable levels in the air have to provide respirators to workers

home builders told congress a bill lowering the 
minimum down payment on governmentbacked home loans would ease the 
nations housing crisis but a grassroots group said it would 
actually make homes less affordable 
the greatest impediment to homeownership is excessive monthly 
housing costs not the down payment gale cincotta of chicago 
chairman of national peoples action told the senate banking 
committee on friday 
in 12 years she said average costs for firsttime buyers have 
soared from less than onequarter of their income to more than 
onethird 
shirley mcvay wiseman of lexington ky president of the 
national association of home builders cited a harvard university 
study that reached a different conclusion 
raising the cash necessary for a down payment is the greatest 
obstacle to homeownership for firsttime buyers she quoted the 
study as saying that study concluded that 81 percent of potential 
firsttime buyers identified as renters between the ages of 25 and 
34 dont have the money to make a 20 percent down payment on a 
medianprice starter home which cost about 69000 in 1986 she 
said 
the two housing experts were among several taking part in a 
hearing on a bill sponsored by sen alan cranston dcalif 
chairman of the committee and 40 other senators cranston said he 
expects the bill aimed at making housing available to more 
americans to be approved by the committee next month although it 
likely will be sometime next year before it can clear congress 
the bill would 
lower the 5 percent minimum down payment on fhainsured 
mortgages for most first home buyers to 3 percent for all fha 
loans the down payment would be cut to 3 percent of the first 
50000 of value up from 25000 and 5 percent of the balance 
permit fha to insure loans for homes worth up to 95 percent of 
local median sales prices which would be as high as 180000 in 
highcost areas of new england and california the current limit is 
101250 
allow owners of individual retirement account and 401k 
retirement plans to withdraw money from those accounts to buy a home 
david perel housing finance officer for los angeles said the 
ira provision is highly desirable although he predicted it would be 
of little benefit to younger families looking for their first home 
cincotta whose organization is a national coalition of 
grassroots communityaction groups said the ira proposal would not 
be equitable because it would represent a federal housing subsidy 
only to those fortunate enough to have a retirement account and in 
case of a foreclosure she said such home buyers could face a 
double whammy losing their home and their life savings in one 
stroke 
willard gourley of charlotte nc president of the mortgage 
bankers association endorsed most parts of the cranston bill 
these enhancements to fha can be the cornerstone of the federal 
governments effort to expand homeownership opportunities he said

a federal prosecutor whose sister was jailed 
for not revealing the whereabouts of her daughter has defied a judge 
by refusing to answer 26 questions about the child 
the judge who jailed elizabeth morgan in 1987 threatened 
assistant us attorney robert m morgan with contempt friday and 
said he could be jailed unless he agrees to answer 
district of columbia judge herbert b dixon jr excused robert 
morgan from the courtroom with a warning to report any change of 
address or employment 
morgan could face professional sanctions including loss of his 
job and disbarrment for his defiance of the judges order to answer 
questions put to him by eric a foretich whom ms morgan has 
accused of sexually abusing their daughter hilary 
dixon has kept the woman in jail since she sent the 6yearold 
girl into hiding rather than allow the father another courtordered 
visit 
the custody battle between ms morgan and foretich who adamantly 
denies abusing the child and contends ms morgan is insane has been 
going on almost since the girls birth in 1983 
the hearing friday was ordered by the district of columbia court 
of appeals to determine if continued coercion would ever get ms 
morgan to reveal where the child is 
robert morgans first refusal came when he was asked the 
whereabouts of his parents who disappeared around the time the 
child was last seen publicly 
your honor i have appeared before most of the judges of the 
court and i have the greatest respect for its jurisdiction he 
said but i respectfully decline to answer that question which 
could lead to the discovery of my niece or further harm to her 
warned by dixon that he faced contempt charges morgan said my 
answer is the same 
ms morgan also testified repeating her contention that she 
would remain in jail for the rest of her life rather than produce 
the child

the experimental drug cd4 is the nearest thing to 
a magic bullet that might one day be used to treat aids 
according to one of the discoverers of the aids virus 
if cd4 doesnt work in the early phases dont despair dr 
robert gallo of the national cancer institute said friday at the 
close of the fifth international conference on aids in montreal 
gallo said cd4 blocks the mechanism where the aids virus attaches 
to certain white blood cells and infects them this mechanism is so 
critical to aids virus growth in the body that some version of cd4 
ought to be able to interfere with it he said 
he also reported that mice given a single aids virus gene 
developed an aidsrelated cancer called kaposis sarcoma suggesting 
the cancer is caused by the virus itself 
gallos studies on kaposis sarcoma offer one possible 
explanation for the origin of the disease in aids patients 
others have evidence indicating kaposis sarcoma may be caused by 
another virus not the aids virus but gallos work questions that 
theory 
his report dealt with a study involving kaposis sarcoma 
developed in mice that were genetically engineered to contain an 
aids virus gene called tat the tat gene is a kind of supercharger 
that speeds up the replication of the aids virus 
mice carrying the tat gene developed kaposis sarcoma but the 
cancer did not arise in the cells carrying the gene according to 
the study but arose from other cells 
gallo said that finding suggests the gene triggers the production 
of some biochemical factor that in turn causes the cancer 
he also said certain kaposis sarcoma cells called spindle cells 
are releasing a whole series of biological molecules that allow us 
to create ks kaposis sarcoma in a mouse 
if the work proves correct it offers the possibility that drugs 
could be designed to interfere with these molecules and treat or 
prevent kaposis sarcoma gallo said 
the aids virus infects certain white blood cells called t4 cells 
or cd4 cells these are master players in the immune system 
directing many immune functions 
gallo said other viruses that activate the immune system and 
therefore t4 cells can aggravate infection with the aids virus 
known as the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
for example a leukemiacausing virus called htlv1 can infect 
the same cells infected with hiv and can turn on hiv in the 
cells resulting in the production of more hiv he said 
human herpes virus type 6 or hhv6 which was discovered 
recently by gallo and his colleagues can also infect the same cells 
and turn on hiv he said 
gallo described what he said was a possible vicious cycle in 
which hhv6 and hiv work together to cause disease 
all of us in this room almost have hhv6 he said healthy 
people control it and it causes no illness but hiv weakens the 
immune system allowing hhv6 to grow 
the proliferating hhv6 then triggers the production of hiv 
according to the study and the hiv further weakens the immune 
system allowing further growth of hhv6 in a continuing cycle

president bush is ready to propose legislation 
requiring a 10million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by 
the end of the century to combat acid rain sources say 
the proposal is expected to be part of a farreaching rewrite of 
the 1970 clean air act that bush will unveil monday he was spending 
the weekend at the presidential retreat in camp david md putting 
finishing touches on the package 
bushs expected proposal for cutting sulfur dioxide emitted 
mainly by coalfired power plants and identified as a main 
ingredient in forming acid rain is not quite as tough as the 
12million ton reduction advocated by environmentalists 
but it was far stronger than utilities and other coalburning 
industries have advocated and represents a dramatic turnabout from 
the reagan adminstrations resistence to any new standards for 
controlling acid rain

in 1987 he had a 60 percent chance of living that long 
in 1982 doctors had only a vague idea of how aids was spreading 
and no idea what was causing it today they know its cause they 
have a drug to fight it and dozens more under study
