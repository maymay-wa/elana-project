the philadelphia inquirer asked a judge 
monday to dismiss a 6 million libel verdict a state supreme court 
justice won after the paper allegedly defamed him 
the verdict was against the evidence and improper contrary 
to law and fact according to a motion for a new trial by 
philadelphia newspapers inc which owns the inquirer 
attorney william hangley filed the motion which went to common 
pleas judge john lavelle of carbon county there was no indication 
when lavelle would rule or set a hearing 
inquirer reporter daniel biddle wrote a 1983 series of articles 
that questioned the ethical conduct of members of the states 
highest court 
justice james t mcdermott filed two lawsuits against the 
newspaper one for the original series and one for the reprint 
which went to the 1984 conference of the american judicature 
society 
the jury decided on dec 7 that biddles original series was not 
libelous but that portions of a february 1984 reprint were false 
the reprint contained the same text as the original series but was 
accompanied by an introduction two editorials and two cartoons 
that had not appeared with the original series 
there was no evidence that anyone at the ajs meeting actually 
read the articles in reprint form at the seminar or anywhere 
else hangley said in the motion 
hangley argued a new trial was warranted because the award of 
compensatory and punitive damages is so excessive as to shock the 
conscience 
the jurys verdicts were inconsistent and irreconcilable 
the motion said the court should correct and set aside such a 
verdict 
the ruling was the second libel judgment against the paper in a 
year in may an attorney won a record 34 million finding against 
the paper for a 1973 story criticizing his handling of a homicide 
case while he was assistant district attorney the paper is 
appealing that ruling as well

a businessman was found guilty in the sale 
of us warplanes left behind in vietnam to undercover customs 
agents 
a federal jury monday convicted cenon rey avelino 40 of filing 
false documents and illegally importing weapons but acquitted him 
of five more serious charges including violations of the trading 
with the enemy act 
the jury partly accepted avelinos defense that he was entrapped 
by customs agents who pressured him to come to the united states to 
complete the 306000 deal for two a37 dragonfly light attack 
planes 
avelino a former pilot for the family of deposed philippine 
president ferdinand marcos who later went into the aircraft 
business faces a 12 to 20month prison sentence under federal 
guidelines no sentencing date was set 
the jury deliberated for 21 hours over four days 
avelino a canadian citizen purchased the planes from the 
vietnamese government and had them shipped to toronto 
roy stafford a jacksonville fla aircraft dealer working with 
customs agents had led avelino to believe he could sell the planes 
to el salvador one agent played an iranian businessman who was 
supposedly the financier of the deal 
avelino was arrested in buffalo in 1989 after the dismantled and 
crated planes were seized at the border 
he was convicted of filing documents that misstated the value 
and nature of the planes and illegally importing 762mm machine 
guns installed in the jets 
if they did not manufacture a crime there would be no case 
he said after the verdict he was allowed to remain free on 
250000 bail 
the pentagon has estimated that nearly 1000 planes 940 naval 
vessels 42000 trucks and 791000 m16 rifles were abandoned in

presiding bishop edmond browning couldnt get his phone calls 
returned when ronald reagan was president now with fellow 
episcopalian george bush in office browning considers himself a 
pastor to the president 
but while presidential access is improving for mainline 
protestants some disgruntled religious conservatives are slamming 
the white house door on their way out they contend bush took their 
votes and then pushed aside their concerns on abortion 
homosexuality and obscenity 
describing a meeting with bush in late october robert dugan 
public affairs director of the national association of 
evangelicals said we told him the truth that his 
administration is on the ropes with evangelicals 
welcome to the new world of religion and politics 
jerry falwell and pat robertson have stepped out of the 
political limelight mainline protestant churches see signs of a 
return to political influence and the catholic church may emerge 
as the most powerful religious power broker of all because of its 
willingness to enter into coalitions with a wide range of allies 
an associated press poll conducted in november by icr survey 
research group indicates americans believe that within some 
limits religious leaders have a responsibility to enter public 
policy debates 
threequarters of the poll respondents said religious leaders 
such as priests ministers and rabbis should speak out on social 
issues but 58 percent including 63 percent of the catholic 
respondents said the clergy should not endorse political 
candidates 
the emergence of issues such as abortion civil rights child 
care and federal funding of the arts into the forefront of national 
public policy debates has shown that no american religious group 
appears willing to give up the good fight 
perhaps the single most dramatic defeat of the forces of 
militant secularism in america is that almost 18 years after roe 
vs wade the abortion issue just hasnt gone away said richard 
neuhaus author of the naked public square and the director of 
the institute on religion and public life in new york 
in the new ballgame the ability to deliver votes not past 
status as the religious elite is what counts 
the heyday of mainline protestantism highlighted when president 
eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the new national council of 
churches building in new york in 1958 declined two years later 
coinciding with the election of the countrys first catholic 
president john kennedy 
bornagain christian evangelicals jolted from political apathy 
by judicial rulings eliminating school prayer and legalizing 
abortion entered the fray 
leaders such as falwell and robertson helped mobilize voter 
registration drives that drew millions into the political process 
and contributed heavily to reagans two presidential victories in 
1988 dugan said bush received 82 percent of the white evangelical 
vote his largest single voting bloc 
but as robertson and falwell left the political spotlight to 
concentrate on less earthly matters some say evangelicals 
influence has waned 
the well is dry for now said barry lynn legislative 
director of the american civil liberties union a frequent opponent 
of religious conservatives on churchstate issues 
others including university of chicago historian martin marty 
say the superstars such as falwell and robertson have been 
replaced by new leaders like radio psychologist and author james 
dobson whose family research council has chapters in 17 states 
lobbying on issues such as abortion home schooling and 
pornography 
the arrest of a florida record store owner and two 2 live crew 
members grew from a focus on the family mailing containing the 
lyrics of the groups explicit rap album as nasty as they wanna 
be 
upset with the republican parts apparent wavering on its 
antiabortion stance and the lack of concern expressed by bush over 
the national endowments for the arts controversy evangelicals may 
be looking for new political partners 
if the president and the party dont wake up they face the 
possibility of a third party in 1992 that would end up giving the 
white house to the democrats said gary bauer a former domestic 
policy adviser under reagan who now oversees the family research 
council these people are up for grabs in a major way 
mainline churches have shown their political influence by 
helping focus attention on human rights abuses in el salvador and 
working for congressional passage of the civil rights restoration 
act said browning the episcopal bishop 
but other observers say those churches are hurt by their 
inability to mobilize grassroots support among their 
congregations 
alan d hertzke author of representing god in washington 
said liberal churches have been effective in lobbying for funds for 
hunger relief and in limiting aid to the nicaraguan contras but 
that some members of congress discount their influence 
theres pretty good evidence that most church members have no 
knowledge of what their national church leaders are doing said 
hertzke a professor at the university of oklahoma 
despite its absolute theological stance on many issues the 
catholic church has proven to be one of the most effective 
religious players in the game of practical politics hertzke said 
for example he said catholics took the lead among religious 
groups in the abortion debate in pennsylvania and forsook an 
allornothing approach to work successfully for a law 
requiring a waiting period for the womans husband to be notified 
and for parental consent to be required for minors 
catholic lobbyists also helped open the door for aid to 
parochial schools by working for a child care bill that allows 
churchrun day care centers to be eligible for federal subsidies 
but what may hurt the churchs sway some observers say are 
highprofile disciplinary actions such as the banning of one 
legislator from the communion rail and threatening others with 
eternal damnation for their abortionrights stands 
demoralization within the church over the clergy shortage and 
internal liberalconservative tensions also limit its influence 
said marty the university of chicago historian 
theyre power brokers but theyre not all that powerful 
theyre divided he said 
as the nation prepares for the possibility of war in the middle 
east james childress author of moral responsibility in 
conflicts is among those who fear religious groups arent doing 
enough to hold the nation accountable to its justwar 
tradition that tradition requires war to be justified in moral 
rather than economic terms 
theres been fairly ready acceptance of the definition of our 
national interest in this setting said childress a university 
of virginia professor 
if america enters a war with iraq childress said it appears a 
majority of religious groups would support the administration 
others say that would be a serious miscalculation 
the national council of churches has urged the administration to 
halt its persian gulf buildup and begin withdrawing troops and the 
national conference of catholic bishops has repeatedly expressed 
reservations about the possibility of a us offensive 
we ignore the religious element to our peril said bishop 
herbert chilstrom spiritual leader of the evangelical lutheran 
church in america there is a profound sense of religious belief 
in our people

juan arreola crouched over a makeshift grill 
beneath an interstate bridge heating his supper of corn tortilla 
and chile peppers 
we are the poorest of all the workers and thats why we are 
here arreola says of the chile pickers who sleep under the 
bridge they call hotel mira estrellas or the hotel star 
gazer 
he and the others cant afford the 2 a night for the 
alternative arreola says a soiled pad atop a metal frame in a 
dingy laborers barracks where one toilet and sink must suffice 
for 20 workers 
farm workers in the chile fields of new mexico have demanded an 
end to what they call exploitation growers say the pickers 
allegations unfairly tarnish all of them for the transgressions of 
a few 
but recent federal investigations support the complaints of the 
pickers who disrupted this years multimilliondollar harvest with 
protests strikes and demonstrations over substandard living 
conditions and povertylevel wages 
a backyard garden vegetable 15 years ago chile peppers now are 
new mexicos largest cash food crop and the state is the nations 
largest chile producer and exporter last years crop was valued at 
nearly 42 million 
but some workers who won legal stats through a 1986 
immigration amnesty program say they havent shared in the 
prosperity 
they think its a lot of money theyre paying us said jesus 
vasquez of ciudad juarez mexico who has been living beneath the 
bridge since may but its not enough 
carlos marentes director of the union de trabajadores agricolas 
fronterrizas the border agricultural workers union said farm 
workers earn an average of 6000 for a family of seven 12000 
less than the federal poverty line 
although federal law requires farmers to pay laborers the 
minimum wage of 380 an hour pickers are being paid the same 
rates for a bucket of peppers as they were a decade ago he said 
meanwhile the size of the bucket has gone from 6 gallons to 10 
gallons 
farmers pay by the bucket picked an average 60 cents to 70 
cents even if a worker does not pick enough buckets to earn 
3040 the minimum wage for an eighthour day farmers or labor 
contractors are required by law to pay the hourly wage anyway 
union organizers and some pickers say farmers arent complying 
i have a wage receipt from a lady who worked eight hours 
and they have four hours on her work receipt she made 21 said 
sandy newlopez a union staff member 
i think what they want is they want the undocumented workers 
they had before 1986 that would stay in the field all day and pick 
for a few cents a bucket marentes said 
farmers believe the union has exaggerated the problems of a 
minority of workers 
i think they bring up isolated incidents said don hackey 
chairman of the new mexico chile commission which represents many 
of the states estimated 400 chile growers they find something 
thats happened to an individual and then portray it as widespread 
and say thats how we all work thats absolutely not true 
hackey said he pays 100 to 150 workers picking his 300 acres as 
much as 80 cents a bucket his own survey of workers on his field 
found the average wage was 54 for about eight hours work 
the only complaint i hear from my people is gosh i wish we 
had this all year hackey said 
us labor department investigators sent out in august found 63 
cases of violations of various federal laws said andy chavez 
district director of the albuquerque wage and hour division of the 
labor department 
a second investigation of 51 growers and farm labor contractors 
that ended in october found 142 violations only six of the 51 were 
in compliance with laws protecting farm workers many of whom say 
they were better off before they were granted amnesty 
i thought it would be a lot better now that i am legal said 
jose cadena 25 who was trying to sleep one night in a pickup 
truck parked beneath an interstate bridge but now its a lot 
worse they used to give housing to the illegal aliens and food 
now we have to pay for our own 
tierra del sol a nonprofit group that provides housing for 
farm workers estimated about 17000 work in southern new mexico 
among them are permanent laborers who live in the towns where they 
work migratory workers who follow the crops and a commuter 
population that comes from juarez and is recruited in el paso 
texas about 90 miles from hatch 
on the same night cadena was sleeping his camper a few workers 
huddled beneath flimsy blankets on an el paso street trying to get 
a little sleep many workers sought shelter inside parked buses 
others paced the street to stay awake 
most of those workers can be found in predawn hours at the foot 
of the paso del norte bridge in downtown el paso waiting for labor 
contractors who will hire them for another days work 
gregorio lopez 33 said he usually arrives at the bridge about 
1 am after catching a 10 pm bus from his home in juarez the 
buses usually return him from the fields at about 6 pm or 7 pm 
all i have a chance to do is shower and eat and come back 
he said i sleep on the bus i get about 1 hours sleep 
lopez said he didnt like to sleep on the street because workers 
who do often awake to find their shoes jacket or money stolen 
more and more people are sleeping out on the street theyre 
not street people they are farm laborers said bill belt 
regional administrator of the us department of labor wage and 
hour division these are good hardworking people 
unfortunately they are caught in a bad situation 
grower eliseo flores believes the producers are the ones with 
the problems 
we need some real help what we got is a bunch of dadgum trash 
that litter the town and litter the fields we were better off with 
wets undocumented workers said flores who farms 200 acres 
these people they go to the bathroom 20 times a day or they go 
in the fields we got a bunch of winos and drug addicts 
flores said hes been forced to knock down houses he set up for 
workers because the structures were vandalized and didnt meet 
federal standards 
hackey the chile commission chairman said farmers already pay 
taxes and shouldnt have to subsidize housing for workers 
instead he said the commission supports tierra del sol which 
has built an apartment complex for laborers in hatch and is trying 
to build another in anthony on the texasnew mexico state line 
no one is really at fault for their situation said rose 
garcia tierra del sols executive director unfortunately 
because they are farm workers they are the working homeless

perhaps its a sign of better times in 
tough old glasgow that this years biggest uproar was about the 
past 
critics attacked an exhibition about the citys 800 years which 
stressed its relations with the world for sanitizing history 
glasgows glasgow as it was called closed nov 5 and was the 
citys biggest attraction in 50 years drawing half a million 
visitors the show may have lost more than 8 million in a 30week 
run which the city will have to cover 
city hall will announce the cost in february when it presents 
the entire bill for the citys year as the european capital of 
culture 
the exhibition promoted as everything glasgow gave to the 
world and more was the centerpiece of the yearlong festival 
celebrating the title bestowed by culture ministers of the 
12nation european community athens florence amsterdam berlin 
and paris were chosen in earlier years 
jill campbell mackay public relations director for the cultural 
year said the title glasgows glasgow meant how the city 
perceived itself as perceived by the outside world 
under 22 arches of storage space below the central railway 
station unused for 60 years the show assembled 3200 artifacts of 
history industry and social life 
they ranged from a model of the yacht shamrock v with which 
glasgow grocery tycoon sir thomas lipton made five unsuccessful 
tries for the americas cup to the suitcase of an emigrant who 
paid 2 pounds then 10 for passage to canada in the 1920s 
documentary films lauded glasgows greatness as the second city 
of the british empire an industrial cornucopia that poured out 
textiles locomotives weapons and by 1913 about 60 percent of 
the worlds ships 
i think the exhibition was a great success said robert 
palmer director of the cultural year a space which was dripping 
wet unusable and derelict was renovated and that space and the 
new arches theater there seem certain to become a permanent part of 
the citys life 
an unusual partnership of business and a socialist council 
budgeted 50 million pounds 80 million when the year began to 
make cultural capital 1990 a success about 7 million went for 
glasgows glasgow 
commercial sponsors contributed cash materials and assistance 
valued at about 12 million 
us ambassador henry e catto visited the show june 20 and 
called it the most imaginative exhibition of its kind i have ever 
seen 
sniper fire was aimed at it regularly however by the daily 
glasgow herald and workers city a group of leftwing and 
anarchist writers poets folk musicians and workers the 60 or so 
active workers city members champion the class struggle against 
what they regard as glasgows yuppie ascendancy 
glasgow is renowned for fierce partisanship alone among british 
cities it is regarded as having come close to revolution in 
1919 during a general strike 
the red flag was raised in george square when 20000 
demonstrators demanded a 40hour work week while the sheriff read 
them the riot act ordering them to disperse a bottle hit him on 
the head forty people were seriously injured when horse and foot 
police charged the crowd 
a photograph of tanks and troops assembled at the cattle market 
was part of glasgows glasgow 
although unemployment remains above 14 percent the cultural 
capital designation recognized glasgows selfregeneration from 
industrial blight slums ill health and violence to a humming 
center of commerce tourism and the arts 
the poor have been moved out of the city center and their 
tenements demolished but to workers city they are no better off 
in the bleak damp tower blocks erected for them on glasgows 
periphery 
we have been accused of being propoverty but it isnt 
true said brendan mclaughlin owner of the scotia bar where 
workers city meets 
in the interests of privatizing glasgow and presenting it as a 
place without problems the glasgows glasgow exhibition buries our 
history of industrial struggle 
john murray the shows marketing executive said we had the 
slums the drink the gambling the crime the sickness and death 
alongside the shipyards the factories the scientists and the new 
industries 
in hopes of making a profit glasgow district council set an 
admission charge of 4 pounds then 650 when the show opened in 
april 
after public and press criticism the price was reduced in july 
to a pound about 160 total attendance was 501105 largest for 
such a show in glasgow since the empire exhibition of 1938 
attracted 12 million visitors from around the world that one lost 
money too 
no exhibition makes money but the cost of subsidizing 
glasgows glasgow was only half the cost of others in europe 
said doug clelland the architect who devised it 
clelland is proud of the exhibitions appeal we did three 
exit surveys and found 30 percent of the people visiting it had 
never before set foot in a museum or gallery he said

one year after parachuting into 
panama at the height of fighting that overthrew manual noriega 
pfc bruce krot faces another christmas away from home threatened 
with war 
this year at least hell have christmas dinner with his wife 
melissa shes also in saudi arabia with the us armys 82nd 
airborne division which she joined nine months ago 
we were separated last year she didnt want it to happen 
again said krot 21 of dearborn mich who serves with a 
company of military police but i consider my company part of my 
family we support each other 
it is a soldiers lot in life sometimes to celebrate a season of 
peace and good will in a theater of war the 82nd airborne landed 
the first us ground forces in saudi arabia under operation desert 
shield 
the 82nd known as the all american division is the armys only 
division with what the military calls forced entry capability 
its troops can parachute into a country or wade ashore if there are 
no friendly airfields or bases 
last dec 20 elements of the 82nd carried the brunt of fighting 
in panama to overthrow and arrest noreiga during operation just 
cause some like krot jumped in others were on the ground doing 
jungle training or came ashore on helicopters or in amphibious 
assaults 
this year the division is part of a multinational force 
assembled against iraqi president saddam hussein 
its a trying time everybody would love to be back home with 
their families and loved ones but we have to carry out our 
mission said sgt elton moton 25 of newport news va you 
live with it accept it were all volunteers 
spec lee etris 25 of greenville sc said when youre 
away from home these guys tend to become family we all put up 
with the same hardships were all in it together 
theres a bond in enduring the same misery somehow its easier 
to take when your buddy has to bear the same relentless heat slug 
it out in the sand put up with the flies cope with the same 
isolation 
its been hell you end up falling back on your buddies to 
pull you through said spec brian langston 22 a medic from 
daytona beach fla he treated four of them for wounds last year in 
panama 
the lead elements of the 82nd fully expected to be in a shooting 
match with the iraqis when their plane doors opened in august and 
they got their first blast of desert heat they were given bullets 
for their rifles and doublechecked their gas masks to face down 
saddams 20 divisions 
we were calling ourselves speed bumps for a while all we 
could have done is slowed him down said spec mark mattson 30 
of port huron mich 
since then about 250000 us troops have followed the 82nd 
airborne into the saudi desert but the four months of waiting have 
taken their toll while the diplomats wage a war of words 
its been a roller coaster said sgt duane barker 23 of 
mansfield ohio who has been away at christmas five times in the 
past six years the worst part of all is not knowing nobody 
minds doing the job nobody has a fear of fighting the frustration 
comes from not knowing 
so the paratroopers train and wait knowing that christmas 
brings them even closer to the jan 15 deadline for the use of 
force set by the united nations if iraq hasnt pulled out of 
kuwait

parliament has banned nude advertising and 
paved the way for restaurants and cinemas to be shut down during 
the sabbath 
the laws are part of a package of sweeping religious legislation 
that the ultraorthodox agudat israel party demanded when it joined 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs governing coalition 
they are likely to heighten the rift between israels 
nonobservant jewish majority and religious jews who have political 
clout far outweighing their numbers 
in a vote of 44 in favor to 42 against the knesset or 
parliament gave final approval monday to a law prohibiting nudity 
or partial nudity with sexual overtones on city billboards or 
bus stops 
religious legislators claim posters featuring partially clad 
models violate jewish dictates of modest dress for men and women 
a second bill submitted by the national religious party 
enables local councils to shut down restaurants theaters and other 
places of entertainment on friday night and saturday the 
sunsettosunset jewish sabbath 
the bill passed 50 to 44 with one abstention 
leftwing legislators argued that the bills are an infringement 
on the rights of the roughly 70 percent of israelis who are not 
orthodox jews they appealed to secular rightwing knesset members 
not to support what one called the law of the middle ages 
tel aviv mayor shlomo lahat condemned religious parties as 
increasing tensions with secular israelis 
he told israel television that places of entertainment will 
remain open in his city during the sabbath despite the new law 
ultraorthodox parties are also seeking legislation tightening 
restrictions on public buses that travel on friday nights and 
saturday religious law expressly bans travel on the sabbath 
the agudat israel party is demanding a fourth law that would ban 
the sale of pork in israel jewish dietary laws forbid pork

ronald gilmore got a shock when he 
returned home after his heart transplant operation 
like thousands of other victims of a 21 million fraud scheme 
gilmore learned his health insurance policy was worthless and 
couldnt cover the cost of the 200000 procedure 
the hospital has been pretty good through it all they havent 
pushed me for the money but this whole things been pretty bad 
said the 49yearold retired brewery worker from robbins 
a federal grand jury last week charged six officers of a 
charlotte company with bilking gilmore and more than 1350 other 
families and individuals out of their insurance benefits and 
pocketing 21 million 
cap programs inc and several associated businesses never paid 
millions in medical claims for workers at 120 small businesses the 
indictment charged 
to gilmore the first hints of trouble came when he was 
recovering at duke university medical center after receiving his 
new heart in october 1989 his coverage was provided by his wifes 
employer a small textile company 
the bills started coming in right away i called them cap 
and they kept giving me the runaround he said finally it 
came out that they just werent going to pay 
all the while prosecutors say the defendants were living the 
high life using the premiums to buy lavish homes beachfront 
condominiums and luxury cars 
id like to see them serve a long hard time in prison said 
gilmore who retired from strohs brewery in winstonsalem after a 
heart attack in 1981 id like to see them spend their time 
making little rocks out of big rocks 
gilmore has been unable to get health insurance now because of 
his medical condition 
they took advantage of people who had no reason to suspect a 
thing he said explaining that cap had paid 14000 in bills 
when he had an earlier hernia operation 
federal officials said that was typical of a ponzi scheme a 
fraud in which money taken in initially by swindlers is used to 
make early payouts and lure in more money 
julian de la rosa inspector general of the us labor 
department said the health insurance scheme was one of about three 
dozen now under investigation he estimated the victims of such 
frauds numbered in the tens of thousands 
what is especially frightening is that we all can be 
victimized by this type of criminal enterprise because each of us 
has a very fundamental need for a health insurance policy that will 
assure us and our families that we can afford the health care we 
may need he said 
the indictment said cap told customers their medical bills would 
be covered by the travelers insurance co but travelers was 
responsible only for processing claims 
in an agreement with north carolina officials travelers has 
paid some medical claims the company also is suing cap 
the 120 companies that used cap are in north carolina south 
carolina georgia virginia kentucky ohio pennsylvania and 
illinois 
the issue of such health insurance scams was the subject of 
hearings last spring in the senate lawmakers heard numerous tales 
like that of gilmore 
for example the parents of a 3yearold leukemia victim from 
alabama testified they were left with 250000 in bills when cap 
did not pay their claim 
the six defendants are robert w long victor s blackwell and 
jerry m wolicki of charlotte david r harris of greenville 
sc michael a krebser of stuart fla and michael h spieles 
of palm city fla 
none of the defendants could be reached for comment long 
blackwell and krebser all have nonpublished numbers and there 
were no listings for wolicki harris and spieles at the addresses 
given by law enforcement officials 
officials also seized seven homes 26 vehicles and business and 
personal bank accounts from the men worth an estimated 3 million 
us attorney tom ashcraft said the seized assets would be used 
to help the victims of the scam but it would be a mistake to 
think there is a big pot of gold out there 
charges include mail fraud money laundering embezzlement and 
conspiracy if convicted they could get five to 10 years in prison 
and fines of 250000 to 500000 on each of the counts

experience isnt necessary for a job 
working with 5000 christmas trees on a central pennsylvania farm 
a prison sentence is 
on the north flank of mount nittany 53 felons from the 
mediumsecurity rockview state prison grow firs pines and spruce 
from seedlings to centerpieces 
fortyone of the prisoners live in unlocked trailers on the side 
of the mountain in the last 13 years there has been one escape 
the guys who would cause a problem will not even get a smell 
of his place said jack allar the superintendents assistant at 
the prison 
the camp was set up in the mid1950s to manage the 3500 acres 
of forest on prison property 
we started 10 years ago putting an emphasis on the christmas 
trees and were just a year or two away from having enough to 
supply all the other state institutions said sgt jim moore a 
prison guard and instructor 
a 15footer is in the rockview rotunda and a tree 7 feet 8 
inches tall is in the prison chapel about 150 others were chopped 
for state police barracks the transportation department and other 
pennsylvania offices 
only government agencies get the trees they cant be bought 
state law prohibits anything being taken off prison property unless 
it goes to other state facilities or is sold as surplus 
the theme is not to compete with private industry its to 
train prisoners in a skill allar said 
the camp is a mile up a narrow road from the prisons main 
cellblocks there are no locks on the trailer doors the guards 
arent armed and a major state highway is a short hike away 
theres not even a fence to climb 
if you think thats something imagine taking 15 inmates over 
the mountain with two chainsaws and 15 axes and all you have is a 
radio said moore 
the incentive to stay in line is a quick trip back to the main 
prison said inmate elwood f barnes who is serving time for 
burglary no one wants to go back there he said 
in a twist the crimes committed here are perpetrated from the 
outside 
somebody always steals the best tree we have to keep cutting 
earlier and earlier to beat the people who come and cut the best 
trees moore said 
the christmas trees start out as seedlings in a woodandplastic 
greenhouse and are transplanted to plots on the 7000acre prison 
complex instructors from a nearby university and videotapes they 
leave behind show prisoners how to shear 
in six to 12 years the trees are ready for harvest trees that 
arent perfect wind up in yule logs that are sent to prison 
offices 
most of the inmates wont be in prison long enough to see a 
seedling turn into a rooms centerpiece many are here long enough 
to learn enough of a new skill though 
one man now has his own tree surgery business said bb 
radomsky who runs the forestry work camp he never had a job 
before he came in here except selling drugs 
another man who excelled at tree pruning left with two skills 
since he also had completed the prisons barber course 
he was the best christmas tree shearer in the place 
radomsky said

elobeid sudan ap like thousands of others suffering the 
effects of a worsening drought and threatened by famine awadalla 
bakheit and his family straggled across western sudan seeking help 
yet like other refugees streaming into this regional capital 
they may merely be given some food and money and shipped back to 
the countryside 
the government is trying to discourage a large permanent camp in 
elobeid which is proving to be an uphill battle 
i walked four days to reach here were just waiting for the 
will of god and what the government will decide said 35yearold 
bakheit at the rukub camp for displaced persons 10 miles north of 
the city 
wearylooking men women and children cluster under the few 
trees seeking shade tents are not provided a tactic by the 
military government to prevent settlement 
across sudan africas largest nation two consecutive years of 
drought conditions have led to fears a serious famine may loom 
in the kordofan region of which elobeid is the capital nearly 
a third of the 35 million inhabitants have been affected 
authorities in elobeid about 200 miles southwest of khartoum 
have delcared the region a disaster area but the central 
government refuses to officially acknowledge the crisis 
famine has struck most of the country affecting up to 7 million 
of its 25 million people and much worse is expected within six 
months relief professionals say a million tons of food are needed 
to avert disaster 
the united states and other western donors have condemned the 
government for refusing to acknowledge that an emergency exists 
thus preventing the international relief operation needed to head 
off mass starvation 
ahmed omer deputy director of the rukub camp said 9000 people 
recently arrived from the nearby countryside 
we will supply them with a months food and pocket money he 
said 
they are then sent packing in trucks either back home or to 
areas where they can find work 
omer said turning people away from the camp was part of the 
policy of lt gen omar hassan elbashirs government not to 
encourage large settlements 
in 198485 thousands died in sudanese camps from lack of 
adequate food and medicine 
col faisal medani mukhtar the regions military governor was 
quoted by the government newspaper alinkaz alwatany as saying his 
region needs 330000 tons of food to see it through until the next 
harvest in late 1991 
a lack of rain made this winters harvest a total failure and 
schools were closed after recent rioting and looting of food 
stocks 
omer said the emergency has been eased somewhat by distribution 
in some areas of 3500 sacks of dura the sudanese staple sorghum 
provided by the european community and the government 
displaced people arrive at the camps in fairly good health 
according to omer although he attested to a few malnourished 
children 
comprehensive health records do not exist but elobeids 
hospital admitted 15 adults and children over a twoday period 
suffering from malnutrition or related problems such as overeating 
an official at the hospital said the overeating occurred when 
people who had gone without food for days stuffed themselves at a 
relief kitchen he said no hungerrelated deaths had been reported 
in the elobeid hospital 
western kordofan also faces a shortage of drinking water because 
it depends on rainwater as its main source 
the regional capitals 600000 residents have only a third of 
the 15 billion gallons of water they need daily governments 
television has reported and the locals blame their thirst partly 
on the displaced people at rukub and other camps 
libya has offered to help build a pipeline more than 30 miles 
long to solve the regions water needs but the project would not 
be completed in time to help this years drought victims 
the united nations childrens organization unicef has provided 
50000 to buy water pumps

everybody and his dog now can munch tropical 
treats being pitched to consumers as the new way to save shrinking 
rain forests 
sales of such products as ice cream mixed nuts and peanut 
brittle for pooches are beginning to channel money from 
environmentally conscious customers in the united states to the 
impoverished inhabitants of the distant forests 
so far the products are heavily dependent on nuts for snacks 
but promoters are hoping to expand to a broader range of consumer 
goods like soaps cosmetics and furniture polish 
the idea is to make sure that the worlds rain forests are worth 
more standing and producing sustainable harvests than cut for 
timber or cleared for pasture 
this by itself is not going to save the worlds rain 
forests said jason clay an anthropologist who has become an 
importer of forest nuts oils and fruits but this can become an 
important part of saving the rain forests and other fragile 
ecosystems 
clay is research director of cultural survival inc in 
cambridge mass a nonprofit group set up in 1972 to promote land 
rights and alternative development schemes for indigenous peoples 
in the third world 
the world resources institute estimated recently that 40 million 
to 50 million acres of tropical forests are vanishing each year a 
pace that could wipe them out by the end of the century 
environmentalists say this is likely to accelerate global warming 
because the forests soak up some of the worlds production of 
carbon dioxide 
scientists say the rain forests also are valuable as a home to 
an abundance of plant animal and insect species that live nowhere 
else some of which could prove useful in ways no one today can 
imagine many are likely to become extinct as their habitat 
shrinks 
in 1989 cultural survival got into the business of promoting 
trade in forest products as a way to get money into the hands of 
the people they were trying to help 
it is selling imports mostly brazil nuts and cashews to 17 
companies currently marketing products in the united states 
including rainforest crunch and bowser brittle it also has 
provided samples to 75 companies for product development clay said 
in a telephone interview 
in hand we have about 41 million in orders for 1991 clay 
said we estimate that within five years were going to be doing 
more than 50 million worth of business 
besides creating new income for people living in the forest 
cultural survival is plowing its profits back into projects to 
strengthen native groups producer coops and other local 
organizations including rubber tappers 
so far most of its work has been in brazil but it is expanding 
into bolivia and peru and has bought some dried fruit from honduras 
and belize honey and beeswax from zambia jams and jellies from 
the philippines and other products from ecuador colombia and 
botswana 
cultural survivals biggest customer is community products set 
up by ben cohen cofounder of ben and jerrys homemade ice cream 
it produces rainforest crunch both as candy for direct sale and as 
an ingredient in ben and jerrys rainforest crunch ice cream 
the concept is a really powerful one said martha broad 
comanager of community products which is based in montpelier vt 
customers like the taste but theyre also excited that were 
helping the people in the rain forest 
this year 300000 pounds of cashews and brazil nuts went into 
rainforest crunch ms broad said adding that a new product is 
coming chocolate chip brazil nut cookies 
then theres bowser brittle a concoction of rain forest 
cashews vanilla extract wheat germ flour eggs and peanuts with 
a label telling buyers they contribute to the saving of the rain 
forest 
the dogs seem to like it its one of our two top sellers 
said teri goodman a partner in dandy doggie a san franciscobased 
manufacturer of dog treats 
randy hayes head of the san franciscobased rainforest action 
network said environmental activists see marketing of forest 
products as a necessary part of a strategy to save the forests 
theres a common misconception that the tropical rain forest 
is unoccupied by humans hayes said 
in addition he said such products as rainforest crunch reach 
people unlikely to read ecology magazines or join environmental 
groups but who may take an interest in the worlds threatened 
forests 
theres been too much preaching to the choir he said the 
environmental movement has sadly become a special interest group 
this is an excellent way of reaching out to other segments of 
society

after killing thousands of people in a 
sevenyear separatist insurrection sikh extremists in punjab state 
are now telling people what they to wear 
the extremists fighting to set up a theocratic nation in the 
rich farming state have threatened to kill punjabi women unless 
they stop wearing jeans and other western clothing 
sikh men have been told not to trim their beards and women have 
been warned not to pluck their eyebrows or use makeup 
the dress code was announced dec 10 by the panthic committee 
an umbrella group for five militant sikh organizations about 54 
percent of punjabs 17 million people are sikhs most of the rest 
are hindus 
failure to comply with the dress code will mean death the 
panthic committee said in its decree which was published in local 
newspapers 
the threat has had considerable impact 
a survey friday of colleges and other public haunts of the young 
in the state capital of chandigarh found no girl or woman wearing 
jeans skirts or other western dress 
most were clad in salwar kameez the traditional kneelength 
tunic worn over voluminous trousers their heads were covered with 
flowing scarves called dupattas 
bk sharma a leading garment seller said his sale of jeans 
has nosedived dropping by 25 percent i am now planning to 
switch over to selling punjabi dresses he said 
threats from the militants last month prompted state government 
officials to stop using hindi the national language at the 
workplace and instead use punjabi 
two local stations of governmentrun all india radio stopped 
relaying hindi and englishlanguage news and song programs from 
its headquarters in new delhi sikh gunmen killed the director of 
one of the stations dec 6 because he had not immediately stopped 
the hindilanguage broadcasts 
punjabs outgoing gov virendra verma admitted friday that the 
government had to some extent succumbed to pressure from the 
extremists the times of india newspaper reported 
the militants have also banned the singing of indias national 
anthem which is in the ancient sanskrit language at morning 
assemblies in schools 
a school principal nirmal kanta was murdered thursday after 
refusing to stop the singing 
the secessionist movement began in 1983 but this is the first 
time the militants have sought to enforce a wide range of social 
changes through the threat of force 
the separatists this year have killed 3100 people according to 
the government more than any previous year 
the panthic committee last week asked journalists to stop 
referring to sikh extremists as terrorists three days later 
militant had largely replaced terrorists in major 
newspapers and the two national news agencies 
police officials still refer to the sikhs as terrorists 
khushwant singh a respected sikh historian and journalist who 
lives in new delhi said people are obeying the militants orders 
out of fear but he predicted the scare was temporary 
it happens but it dies down nobody will give a damn about 
these thugs in a week or two said singh who opposes the 
separatist campaign 
sikh separatists complain of cultural political and economic 
discrimination by indias officially secular but hindudominated 
government 
the sikh faith founded about 1500 has roots in both islam and 
hinduism while they constitute a majority of the punjabi 
population sikhs nationwide comprise 2 percent of indias 880 
million people who are 82 percent hindus and 12 percent moslems

a japanese research team has successfully revived 
small insects after deepfreezing them for nearly two weeks in what 
could be a step toward prolonging the life of larger animals 
scientists say they believe the defrosting of water fleas by a 
team led by professor ichiro tanasawa of the tokyo university was 
the first time complex multicellular organisms have been revived 
after being frozen to minus 321 degrees 
at that temperature metabolism virtually halts and 
theoretically organisms can be kept frozen for any length of time 
and then revived tanasawa says 
tanasawas team first chilled the water fleas to almost freezing 
to slow their metabolism it then soaked them for several hours in 
a glycerin solution which penetrated their cells and lowered the 
freezing point like the antifreeze in a car radiator 
the glycerin also prevented formation of large ice crystals 
inside the fleas organs and caused the insects to freeze more 
uniformly tanasawa said they then were cooled at a controlled 
rate to minus minus 321 degrees 196 centigrade 
a british research group first successfully used glycerin a 
nonpoisonous syrupy liquid to freeze chicken sperm in 1960 and 
the technique is now widely used to preserve blood cells and simple 
organisms 
the main difficulty in using it for more complicated organisms 
has been glycerins low penetration rate 
without its antifreeze effect ice crystals form from the water 
inside cells drying them out and damaging them said dr harold 
meryman assistant director of blood services for the us red 
cross 
ice inside the tissue causes tremendous damage he said in a 
telephone interview 
tanasawa said about 90 percent of the water fleas which 
resemble regular fleas but live in water were defrosted in perfect 
condition in his experiment 
he said his research group spent two years experimenting with 
different glycerin concentrations and freezing rates before it 
achieved success 
we hope to make the process more sophisticated so we can have 
a 100 percent success rate and be able to use it for larger 
organisms he said 
then people will be able to freeze things that they want to 
revive at a later time for example baby fish could be frozen 
until there is greater seasonal demand and then be defrosted and 
allowed to grow 
but humans hoping to prolong their own lives will have to wait 
i will not accept a generalization that this opens the door 
for the freezing of much larger tissues meryman said 
many other people have tried freezing mammalian tissues using 
similar methods without success it is not currently possible to 
prevent significant damage to large organs from ice crystals 
tanasawa says his goal is much smaller to successfully freeze 
and revive organisms about 10 times the size of a flea 
water fleas dont do anyone much good he said next i 
want to try something useful

the bombing of kahoolawe has stopped the 
question is for how long 
use of the pockmarked 27000acre island by the military for 
target practice has been suspended for two years the political 
maneuvering over who ultimately will get control of kahoolawe is 
just beginning 
the dry mostly barren island 10 miles west of maui has been 
ravaged by 49 years of conventional bombing by us planes and 
warships some historical sites have been damaged the landscape 
has been scarred and topsoil has been lost to erosion caused by 
bombs and grazing goats and sheep the bombing has also been a 
source of deep pain for native hawaiians who view the island with 
its ancient shrines as a sacred place 
the former penal colony and cattle ranch was seized by the navy 
in 1941 after pearl harbor kahoolawe had been used for target 
bombing since 1953 until president bush signed the 1991 defense 
appropriations bill on nov 5 
the bill contained an amendment sponsored by sen daniel akaka 
dhawaii that puts a halt to the bombing for two years the law 
also established a commission to help determine the best way to 
return the island to the state 
but the threat of war in the middle east has military officials 
pressing for limited use of the island some who worked to halt the 
bombing worry that bush may issue an executive order permitting 
military use of the island if war begins with iraq 
the kahoolawe island conveyance commission includes two 
appointees from gov john waihee two navy appointees and an 
appointee from the office of hawaiian affairs the commissions 
first meeting was scheduled for today 
the panel can recommend a ban on all military use or allow the 
military unlimited or partial access to the island the three 
nonnavy appointees oppose any bombing the panels recommendations 
are subject to approval by congress 
cmdr joel keefer a spokesman for the navys pacific command 
said kahoolawe is needed to train troops for the long term not 
just for operation desert shield 
kahoolawe offers us the only place for the kind of training we 
need to perform aircraft gunfire support amphibious 
landings keefer said we have forces in the pacific and we 
need to train them where they are 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii has flipflopped on the the issue 
twice in recent months he was a longtime advocate of the 
militarys use of kahoolawe then came out in support of akakas 
bill before the november election and pledged to work for the 
return of the island to hawaii 
last week he said the island is needed to train troops for 
operation desert shield 
inouyes reversal disappointed many of us said dr noa 
emmett aluli cofounder of the protect kahoolawe ohana and a 
member of the commission aluli helped form the protect kahoolawe 
ohana in 1975 and has taken part in several occupations of the 
island to prevent target bombing 
aluli said the island holds a special spiritual and cultural 
significance to native hawaiians ancient hawaiians were the only 
people ever to inhabit the island there are fishing shrines 
agricultural shrines major temples and housing sites which have 
landed kahoolawe on the national register of historic places 
the history of our ancient hawaiian people is intact on 
kahoolawe aluli said no way will i allow a resumption of 
bombing 
maui mayor hannibal tavares another commission member said as 
the western part of maui becomes more populated bombing of 
kahoolawe becomes more dangerous because errant shells can strike 
the cities of lahaina and kihei 
tavares and others say the military has better sites to train

telephone companies are making it easier for 
the government and big business including the irs and credit 
agencies to reach out and touch someone thanks to computerized 
phone directories 
for a hefty fee largevolume users of white pages directories 
may tie their computers into phone company computer banks then 
they can enter a name city and state and get an uptodate 
address zip code and phone number 
if a user has only a name and no city or state they most likely 
will get multiple listings about 10 names at a time on their 
computer screens the customer pays for each screen of material 
that is displayed plus monthly connection charges passwords and 
longdistance charges if any 
the phone companies are prohibited by a federal consent decree 
from providing anything more than a person could find in a printed 
white pages directory that means no electronic yellow pages no 
special groupings by regions addresses or phone numbers that also 
means no unpublished or unlisted numbers 
but beverly hollifield a product manager for bellsouth 
services said computerized white pages should be useful for 
credit verification possibly government organizations the 
irs or companies that make mass mailings and need to verify 
addresses 
the service began in southwestern bell telephones fivestate 
territory in june and now is being adopted by other regional bell 
phone companies 
american telephon amp telegraph co is providing nationwide 
access to the regional services meaning a caller in new york may 
electronically find listings in texas for example atampt expects to 
be able to offer its service to 80 percent of the country by spring 
1991 
the advantages of such a service is speed meaning time and 
money saved and the listings are updated daily making them as 
effective as traditional operator assistance and more reliable than 
most white pages directories 
its targeted at customers that really use quite a bit of 
directory assistance banking telemarketing insurance credit 
collections said ellen zundl an atampt spokeswoman 
if you run the kind of operation that deals with lets say 
20000 listing requests a month or more this really saves you a 
lot of time zundl added 
she said the atampt find america service takes just 36 seconds 
per listing on average compared with an average 36 seconds through 
a long distance directory assistance operator 
southwestern bell expects its service will generate about 1 
million in revenue in 1991 said dean jeffries the companys 
product manager thats small change for a company that had nearly 
9 billion in revenue last year 
it did get off to a slow start jeffries said of the 
directline custom service but the growth has been much as 
expected the service now has four solid customers and the demand 
is starting to pick up jeffries said 
one company us west communications is offering local listings 
to residential users of the community link videotext service in 
omaha and council bluffs neb the service will be expanded to 
minneapolis next year said tom lee a us west spokesman 
but the cost probably will make this a businessonly service for 
the foreseeable future 
subscribers to us wests electronic white pages access service 
which began in the companys 14state region last month must pay a 
243 startup fee a 163 monthly charge 850 for each 
identification number needed to reach the service and 1463 cents 
for each screen of numbers viewed 
the user also must pay any longdistance charges accrued while 
connecting with us west computers

donald trump sold off a piece of his 
empire raising 88 million to satisfy bankers in an auction of 35 
luxury condos built on the wrong side of this prestigeconscious 
resort 
buyers on sunday paid from 185000 to 720000 or onehalf to 
twothirds of previous asking prices for the waterfront units at 
trump plaza of the palm beaches the twin 32story towers are 
across the intracoastal waterway from exclusive palm beach 
the original prices which ranged as high as 18 million for 
the penthouse were cut under pressure from marine midland bank 
the bank wanted trump to unload the units that had gone unsold 
since the developer took over the building in 1986 boasting that 
the complex would be floridas hottest property 
trump who must meet 345 million in payments today on two of 
his casinos in atlantic city nj said he was pleased by the 
auction 
we far exceeded our expectations today this was a tremendous 
sale for trump plaza said trump who congratulated several 
buyers as they left the auction ballroom at the breakers hotel to 
sign sales papers 
trump was pushed into the auction by marine midland which 
loaned him 60 million after he missed a 271 million payment due 
oct 22 only one sale had been recorded this year and about 85 of 
the 221 units remained unsold after the auction 
we think that our buyers got a tremendous buy said william 
lange president of lange financial corp the auctioneer we 
just brought in 35 new neighbors and made a community out of the 
trump plaza as opposed to an empty building 
the development boasts a spacious leather and marbledominated 
lobby concierge valet parking swimming pools that catch morning 
and afternoon sunlight a fitness center and tennis court but the 
penthouse has no interior walls and the other units have concrete 
floors and drywall 
the satisfaction of the auction may be shortlived for trump 
today is the deadline for paying bondholders 184 million on 
the trump castle and 161 million on the trump plaza hotel and 
casino in atlantic city the trump castle has a 10day grace period 
and the trump plaza 30 days if the deadlines are missed 
the philadelphia inquirer reported friday that trump plaza has 
just 17 million in the bank and trump castle has only 18 million

the number of people convicted in state courts 
of drugrelated felonies leaped by 69 percent over two years 
according to justice department research 
about onethird of the 667400 people convicted of felonies in 
state courts two years ago about 227000 people were found 
guilty of drug trafficking or possession according to the bureau 
of justice statistics report released sunday 
in 1986 just under onefourth of the 582800 felony convicts 
or about 134000 people had been found guilty of drugrelated 
offenses according to information provided by bureau statistician 
patrick a langan 
its certainly what one would expect these days said 
langan who wrote the report with fellow bureau statistician john 
m dawson 
the states apparently were cracking down on drug offenders long 
before the bush administration began exhorting them to do so the 
report indicates 
felony convictions for drug trafficking increased from 13 
percent to 17 percent of the total felony convictions from 1986 to 
1988 the report found at the same time drug possession felony 
convictions rose from 10 percent to 17 percent of the total langan 
said 
drugrelated cases represented 23 percent of the felony 
convictions in 1986 and 34 percent in 1988 given the larger number 
of total felony convictions two years ago the increase in 
drugrelated felony convictions amounted to 69 percent 
this was occurring as the total number of felony convictions in 
state courts was increasing at the much lower rate of 145 percent 
the report says 
langan said he believed the increase in drugrelated felony 
convictions was due to an increase in lawbreaking and arrests not 
to new laws targeting a greater range of behavior 
i dont think youre going to find much evidence of that 
langan said 
for example he said one of the changes that im aware of in 
the laws regarding drugs is a growing number of states are passing 
laws that increase the penalty for trafficking drugs within 100 
yards of a school 
people who are convicted will have to pay a heavier penalty 
langan said but its not as though that wasnt a felony before 
those laws were passed 
the studys most reliable data concerns the 75 most populous 
counties langan said as those were studied in depth in 1986 and 
1988 the margin of error is 2 percent for those counties in both 
years 3 percent for the 1988 national figures and 12 percent for 
the national figures in 1986 the first year the research was done 
the number of counties checked nationwide increased from 100 in 
1986 to 300 two years ago 
for the 75 counties total felony convictions in state courts 
rose 27 percent to 310547 
drugtrafficking felony convictions rose 61 percent in those 
counties other large increases there were in aggravated assault 
19 percent larceny 17 percent and burglary 14 percent murder 
convictions rose 5 percent robbery convictions remained the same 
and rape convictions declined 4 percent other felonies a 
category including drug possession forgery fraud weapon 
possession and other offenses rose 34 percent 
on a national basis the report also found that 
state courts sentenced 44 percent of their convicted felons to 
state prison 25 percent to jail 30 percent to probation and 1 
percent to alternative sentences 
death sentences were given to 2 percent of those convicted of 
murder or nonnegligent manslaughter 
about 79 percent of the felons had one felony conviction 15 
percent had two and 6 percent had three or more the likelihood of 
receiving a prison sentence increased with the number of felony 
convictions of those with one felony 39 percent went to prison 
of those with two 56 percent among those with three or more 66 
percent 
among those convicted of felonies 91 percent pleaded guilty 5 
percent were convicted by a jury and 4 percent were found guilty by 
a judge 
about 57 percent of the felons convicted in 1988 were white 41 
percent were black and 2 percent were of other races of the total 
87 percent were male the average age was 29 years

two foundations have awarded grants totaling 
245 million to help devise better ways of judging students 
knowledge and ability to think clearly 
one grant announced sunday is a 115 million award from the 
pew charitable trusts of philadelphia to the university of 
pittsburghs learning research and development center 
the second 13 million from the john d and catherine t 
macarthur foundation of chicago will go to the national center on 
education and the economy in rochester 
the two research centers will work together to devise ways of 
assessing student performance other than through the usual 
multiplechoice exams the collaboration could extend over a 
decade a joint announcement said 
these are some of the testing methods the researchers are likely 
to look into 
examinations in which students demonstrate specific skills to 
panels of examiners much as an olympic figure skater performs for 
a panel of judges 
projects in which students show their ability to use 
problemsolving skills over time often with other students 
portfolios consisting of the best work done by students in a 
variety of areas over time 
the two research centers said they planned over the next three 
months to assemble a group of school districts and states that 
would help develop and test the new methods 
if successful the methods could replace standardized 
multiplechoice tests now common at most us schools 
several recent studies claim that the most frequently used 
standardized tests give misleadingly positive signals about how 
well prepared american youngsters are for the complex problems they 
will face as adults 
critics say such tests fail to assess a students ability to 
solve problems creatively or to cooperate with others

a new report to congress says about 25 percent 
of the nations grocery stores authorized to accept food stamps may 
be accepting them for forbidden items such as beer and cigarettes 
and cash 
the agriculture departments office of inspector general said 
most of the violations apparently involve small and mediumsize 
establishments among the 220000 stores nationwide that participate 
in the program 
supermarkets make up about 15 percent of the stores authorized 
to accept food stamps but handle about 74 percent of all food 
stamps redeemed the report said our studies have shown that 
these large retailers general have adequate controls and systems in 
place to prevent program abuse 
the report said the departments food and nutrition service 
which administers the program estimated that 53000 of the 220000 
stores may be selling nonfood items for stamps and that more than 
3200 retailers may be exchanging food stamps for cash 
the semiannual report as required by law covered audit and 
investigative activities for the last half of the 1990 fiscal year 
april 1 through sept 30 
a special look at food stamps was included as an area of 
particular interest to congress and usda management 
although the report was not distributed generally a copy was 
provided to the associated press upon request 
the report said about 28 million people received food stamp 
benefits at some time during fiscal 1989 on average 188 million 
people in more than 7 million households received assistance each 
month 
overall more than 117 billion worth of food stamps were 
issued in fiscal 1989 the report said administrative costs added 
12 billion to the federal bill 
by law food stamps can be used to buy only food in authorized 
stores in practice the coupons sometimes are illegally sold or 
traded 
of particular concern in recent months has been the use of 
food stamps as a second currency to purchase drugs weapons stolen 
property and other illegal items the report said as a result of 
these transactions family members who should receive food through 
the program do not 
in the 1990 fiscal year that ended sept 30 compliance officers 
of the food and nutrition service reviewed 5447 retailers of 
those 1395 were found to be in violation 
food stamps are issued to eligible recipients through state 
welfare agencies the recipients spend the stamps at stores for 
groceries and the stores deposit the stamps at banks which credit 
the stores with the full face values of the coupons 
the banks send the redeemed stamps to a federal reserve bank 
which credits the account of the local food stores bank the 
federal bank then bills the us treasury for the face value of the 
stamps and then destroys them 
errors in food stamp certification often result with some 
households getting more or less than they are supposed to outright 
recipient fraud sometimes exists on the part of householders 
states are responsible for certification and issuance of stamps 
and therefore state agencies conduct the majority of investigations 
of recipient fraud the report said in return usda reimburses the 
states for 75 percent of their investigative expenses 
the report said that in fiscal 1989 the states conducted more 
than 360000 recipient fraud investigations which produced nearly 
16000 criminal convictions and 24000 recipient disqualifications 
food stamp buying and selling trafficking have attracted 
news media attention in recent months especially when stamps are 
traded for drugs 
often this involves nonauthorized retailers the report said 
therefore its difficult to estimate the volume of dealings 
except that investigators say its widespread 
for example local welfare officials in a large metropolitan 
area estimated that at certain issuance points where trafficking 
was believed to be most widespread about 50 percent of recipients 
were approached by individuals who offered to buy their food stamps 
for cash the report said 
it was further estimated that about 50 percent of those 
approached appeared to sell at least some of their food stamps 
the report added that it is not uncommon for food stamp 
trafficking to be part of larger criminal enterprises such as 
theft and fencing rings or drug trafficking operations 
department investigators said they strongly support a number 
of initiatives under consideration that would reduce food stamp 
abuse one system being tested is electronic benefits transfer or 
ebt which would be an alternative to the use of paper food stamps 
states also are being urged to upgrade specific criminal 
statutes so food stamp traffickers can be prosecuted more 
effectively the report said 
also it said the establishment of a strike team of 
investigators has been proposed in 1992 to detect and investigate 
food stamp fraud at the retailer level

mom couldnt get you to drink your milk but 
madonna might 
at least thats what a bigtime new jersey dairyman and an 
outgoing minnesota senator hope 
theyre trying to persuade the dairy industry to levy a tax on 
itself to finance a multimilliondollar advertising war with the 
soft drink industry 
skeptics such as agriculture secretary clayton yeutter believe 
americans already drink as much milk as theyre going to 
but marc goldman who runs an independent dairy in the new york 
city area and sen rudy boschwitz rminn say milks problem 
isnt that americans dont want to drink it but that they havent 
been sold on it 
if your mother tells you to drink milk and madonna tells you 
to drink soda madonna wins most of those arguments goldman 
said weve got to get madonna and others like her on our side 
at boschwitz initiative the 1990 farm bill passed by congress 
authorizes the government to collect a tax of 20 cents per 100 
pounds of milk if a majority of the nations milk processors 
approve of it in a referendum no vote has yet been scheduled 
the assessment would work out to about 1 cents a gallon 
processors could take it out of their profits or pass it on to 
consumers 
soft drink manufacturers spend 500 million a year hawking their 
product while dairy farmers invest a relatively meager 60 
million goldman said so its no wonder to him that us milk 
consumption has fallen markedly over the last two decades 
in 1965 americans drank 24 gallons of milk and 18 gallons of 
soft drinks each today the average consumer drinks 46 gallons of 
soda and just 21 gallons of milk 
milk has been relegated to the dowdy and to babies too young 
to understand marketing tactics goldman said in a column for 
dairy foods an industry publication 
goldman is president of farmland dairies an independent milk 
handler in wallington nj that buys from 800 producers and 
claims 15 percent of the new yorkarea market 
boschwitz a longtime friend won passage of the promotion plan 
before losing reelection in november he sees the program as an 
enormous boon to the dairy farmers in minnesota and around the 
country 
us milk consumption which has been relatively flat could 
rise 4 percent to 6 percent a year the senator claims 
goldman believes there is a future in products like skim milk he 
sells that is fortified to taste like the fat hasnt been removed 
and flavored drinks like the strawberry and root beer milk that 
boschwitz has sold each year at his minnesota state fair booth 
there is some evidence to support their optimism 
the hottest growth in the beverage industry has been in bottled 
water carbonated juices and other drinks considered more healthful 
than soda said hellen berry an analyst with the consulting firm 
beverage marketing 
milk has never been creatively marketed she said whenever 
anybody makes noise about a beverage product it does have an effect 
on sales she said 
yeutter whose department would set up the advertising fund 
believes that us milk consumption has peaked despite recent 
marketing success stories with yogurt and highpriced ice cream 
new markets will have to be found overseas he said

south carolina legislators their 
reputations tainted by a bribery scandal soon will have the chance 
to show whether they want to put words about reform into action 
when the legislature returns in january it faces the challenge 
of restoring public confidence in the wake of an fbi sting that led 
to the indictment of 10 lawmakers and one lobbyist 
i figured politics was pretty corrupt around here we found 
out how said william carter jr an inventory manager at a 
hardware company in sumter 
the sting operation lost trust was set up to look for bribery 
and other corruption at the statehouse it succeeded 
nine legislators were charged with selling their votes for cash 
another legislator and a lobbyist were charged with drug 
possession 
seven have pleaded guilty and one legislator was convicted at 
trial the three others await trial in january earlier this month 
a former senator was sentenced to six months in a halfway house and 
an exrepresentative got a 6year prison term 
the indictments shined a bright light on south carolinas lax 
regulation of campaign finance lobbying and ethics 
the state allows any person or group to give an unlimited amount 
of money to political campaigns candidates do not have to report 
donations until after the election lobbyists can give gifts to 
legislators 
after the scandal broke in july lawmakers began scrambling to 
reform the system legislators and other interest groups have 
proposed more than 100 reform measures 
much as the cross gave christianity a focal point and purpose 
so should the tragedies of the past 120 days give each of us the 
zeal and much needed attention to reform senate president pro 
tem marshall williams said in a letter to colleagues last month 
williams has written a 105page bill that would radically reform 
campaign finance ethics and lobbying laws 
sen ed saleeby a cosponsor of the bill said it could run 
into trouble for being too restrictive he said for instance that 
it would hurt the system if legislators were not permitted to take 
trips to inspect industrial sites at a businesss expense 
house speaker bob sheheen pushed the house earlier this month 
into adopting a wideranging ethics package as part of its own 
internal rules 
the house limited the amount of money lobbyists can donate to 
campaigns and also banned legislators with some exceptions from 
accepting meals or entertainment from lobbyists the rules apply 
only to house members 
some lawmakers argue they cannot create a perfectly clean 
system bribery already was illegal they note so anyone open to 
accepting bribes still will find ways to do so 
what we can do is throw up roadblocks to make bribery less 
tempting said sen john courson 
many of the proposed reforms attack problems linked not directly 
to the bribery scandal but to the impression of an ethically weak 
legislature 
what the sting did was force the disclosure of other unseemly 
aspects of the legislature said john crangle head of the 
states common cause chapter it galvanized a number of media 
people into looking at whats going on up there 
crangle cited stories about lobbyists picking up bar tabs 
golfing fees and the cost of trips as well as latenight poker 
games at a columbia hotel 
legislators who had never embraced reform now know they must 
change the way the legislature does business crangle said 
i dont think they realized how bad the system had gotten 
he said

lew schneider says his car was broken into 
shortly after he moved here from chicago i told the police 
ive been here 28 days what the hells going on 
and the way they explained it to me was look they got a lot 
of cars to break into and they get to them as fast as they can 
 
schneider may sound like just another comedian mining new yorks 
misery for cheap laughs but hes supposed to be boosting local 
morale 
that at least was the stated purpose for comedians for new 
york a monday night fixture at a comedy club called stand up new 
york 
two months ago the club was looking for a monday theme to 
replace whats so funny about the persian gulf because 
comedians were having trouble coming up with new material and 
since time magazine had just bashed the city in a cover story we 
decided to make an attempt to counteract the citys negative 
image said publicity director jennifer walker 
in reality however schneider and his colleagues answer the 
weekly call to stand up for the city with jokes about surly 
cabbies outrageous prices and wooden fire escapes 
not that they dont love new york taylor mason a new jersey 
resident says he comes in to try out his car alarm and billiam 
coronel enjoys watching the garbage change color with the seasons 
coronel also was pleasantly surprised by the bronx zoo its 
very nice because whenever you think of a zoo in new york you 
assume dead animals bullet holes in the cheetah maybe a 
rhino jacked up on cinder blocks and homeless people living inside 
the kangaroos 
but no one has a good word for the taxi drivers how can a 
passenger sit back and relax asks adrianne tolsch when the sit 
back and relax sign has bullet holes in it when the drivers 
hack license photo is a police sketch 
scott blakeman on the other hand says he doesnt like to 
complain about cabbies many of them have fled persecution in 
other countries and maybe the quickest way to 81st street is 
through canada 
anyway most comics can afford only the subway they call my 
train the no 1 but it smells like number two says sam 
greenfield 
he notes that in boston people formed a human chain to rescue 
someone who had fallen onto the tracks next to an electrified third 
rail in new york someone would say spit on her lets get a 
spark going 
jim david was riding the subway when he noticed a poster ad that 
said pregnant we can help next to it someone had written in 
not pregnant yet i can help 
crime is funny jon solomon suspects that when aliens from outer 
space finally land here new yorkers will snap the antennas off 
their heads 
ms tolsch learned to use her apartment keys as a weapon by 
sticking them between the fingers of her fist so she tried this 
against a mugger my luck the keys fit right into this guys 
face 
mike sweeney is skeptical about mayor david dinkins plan to 
hire thousands of additional police officers but says it suggests a 
stock tip buy dunkin donuts 
coronel the man whose apartment has a wooden fire escape notes 
that new york has a doormans union why he asks they cant 
go on strike what are they going to do stand in front of your 
building 
as a special service stand up new york has posted this offer at 
its monday night shows we will allow any audience member who 
wishes to give a funny anecdote about the good things in new york 
to go on stage 
so far said ms walker there have been no takers

the first phase of the strategic defense 
initiative could be the next version of the illfated hubble 
telescope mission a congressional panel is warning 
the house government operations committee citing pentagon 
documents testimony at hearings and a general accounting office 
report released in july on sunday raised serious questions about 
deploying the system commonly known as star wars in 1993 
in january the pentagon incorporated the brilliant pebbles 
concept into phase 1 of the sdi system that technology involves 
several thousand interceptors that would orbit the earth to seek 
and destroy a target by smashing into it at high speeds 
phase 1 also involves seven highly integrated elements 
including two spacebased sensors a spacebased weapon two 
groundbased sensors a groundbased weapon and a command and 
control system 
the gao also said that detailed tests planned by the sdio or the 
strategic defense initiative organization wont be completed before 
the scheduled executive decision on deployment in 1993 
sdio is a defense department agency that oversees the star wars 
program 
based on the problems of incomplete testing the gao said it 
doesnt believe the sdi organization will be able to give the 
president enough information to support a 1993 decision to deploy 
phase 1 
the fallacy of sacrificing adequate testing for early 
deployment is highlighted by the hubble space telescope 
democrats and republicans on the committee said in the 39page 
report 
this is but a small example of the problems that could beset a 
far more complex sdi system composed of thousands of spacebased 
components the report said 
shortly after the 15 billion hubble telescope was launched 
from the space shuttle discovery last april officials discovered a 
problem with the primary mirror which was providing a blurred view 
of the universe 
nine of 15 republicans on the committee dissented from the 
report saying it was unclear why the panel prepared the report 
the gop members also contend that a possible delay in deploying the 
sdi system is not due to problems with the program but rather 
congressional cuts in the sdi budget 
president bush recently signed a defense budget for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 that provided 29 billion for sdi nearly 
2 billion less than bush requested from congress and 900 million 
less than congress provided last year 
what is most troubling is what appears to be an underlying 
assumption that the likely inability of sdio to support a 1993 
deployment decision is the result of the way sdio is conducting the 
program said the gop lawmakers this is unfortunate and 
untrue 
maj mike doble a spokesman for sdio said friday the agency 
had not seen the report and would have no immediate comment 
the report is based largely on a gao study that said deploying 
the first phase of star wars would be premature and fraught with 
high risk because of problems with design and testing 
the investigative arm of congress said the introduction of the 
brilliant pebbles concept had drastically changed the systems 
design leaving it in a state of flux 
the committee report also questions the cost estimates of the 
sdi program the pentagon plans to spend between 69 billion and 
87 billion to develop and deploy the first phase of the strategic 
defense system designed to protect the united states from a soviet 
nuclear ballistic missile attack 
to date 2 billion has been spent on the phase 1 aspect of the 
system the committee contends that the cost could easily increase 
sdios 69 billion estimate for phase 1 represents only a 
snapshot at a point in time as the system is still changing 
however department of defense experience has shown that such early 
estimates usually increase significantly for a variety of 
reasons the committee said 
the pentagon also believes that the brilliant pebbles 
concept will be cost effective however the committee notes a 
march 1990 report by the lawrence livermore laboratory concluding 
that it is highly unlikely that brilliant pebbles will be cost 
effective 
according to the report each pebble would cost about 2 
million to produce and deploy this is almost double earlier 
estimates the committee said citing the laboratory report 
eleven of 23 democrats on the panel said in an addition to the 
report that the country could illafford the folly of reagans 
star wars dream a decade ago twenty billion dollars later we can 
barely afford even the more prudent course of continuing with its 
basic research

there may be a whole lotta shakin going on 
if sound waves become the industry standard for processing soybean 
oil 
researchers at the national center for agricultural utilization 
research devised the use of ultrasound to remove gummy impurities 
from the nations no 1 vegetable oil 
the technique is faster and more effective than the conventional 
method of mixing water with crude soy oil so that the sticky gums 
can be removed in a centrifuge said food chemist timothy mounts 
this would be an avenue to look at maybe better than the 
mechanical means said david erickson director of technical 
services for the american soybean association 
when soybeans are crushed to make oil for cooking and salad 
dressing processors must remove gummy impurities fatty acids and 
phospholipids that can increase refining losses and create 
flavors that are slightly off 
mounts who developed the system with colleague karl moulton 
said it has been done only at the government laboratory 
we have demonstrated the feasibility of the technology but we 
dont know about the commercial costs said mounts it should 
be equivalent to the current process maybe cheaper on a perunit 
basis because you move the product through the system more 
rapidly 
the process uses highfrequency sound waves to vibrate the oil 
and water mixture at 20000 times per second creating tiny bubbles 
and causing the gums to cluster 
the gums which bond with hydrogen from the water then are spun 
away from the oil in a centrifuge 
taste panelists could not tell the difference between soy oil 
refined the conventional way and oil processed with the ultrasound 
system 
mounts said the technology is available to the soybean 
processing industry at no cost 
theres no patent he said they can do with it what they 
will

a proposed city measure to regulate the use 
of computer screens could cost employers up to 76 million over two 
years and according to some critics drive a lot of business out 
of san francisco 
the video display terminal or vdt ordinance was scheduled to 
go before the board of supervisors today for a final vote with 
approval expected 
the ordinance would mandate adjustable chairs special lighting 
and rest breaks the law which would affect city government and 
businesses with 15 or more employees also would require glare 
shields detachable keyboards and tables with sufficient leg space 
obviously this will have a wider impact than just in san 
francisco i am sure that many municipalities will be looking at it 
and will probably think about similar types of legislation said 
bruce dickerson executive director of a national industry 
organization the center for office technology 
mayor art agnos has not committed himself to signing the 
proposal if he refuses to sign it the supervisors who favored it 
in an 81 vote last week could override his veto with eight votes 
from the 11member board 
agnos and his staff have spent the last week meeting with 
supervisors and labor and business leaders in an effort to work out 
a compromise 
city budget analysts estimate san francisco would have to spend 
14 million to 6 million during the next two years to comply with 
the bill in its present form while business would have to spend 
315 million to 765 million 
the chamber of commerce and other business officials have warned 
that the proposal drive companies out of the city 
legislating seems counterproductive said bill allen atampt 
district manager for government relations our feeling is that we 
can best address the issue on a voluntary basis 
supporters believe the cost estimates are too high they also 
say analysts have overlooked how much money would be saved by 
reducing vdtrelated injuries which can cost thousands of dollars 
to treat and boosting productivity 
if someone thinks its cheaper to move out of the city than to 
provide an adjustable chair or decent lighting thats pretty 
shortsighted said barbara kellogg of the vdt coalition a group 
that helped draft the bill 
companies would have two years to implement the law after that 
violators could be fined up to 500 per day 
business owners successfully challenged the only similar 
ordinance passed in the country in suffolk county on new yorks 
long island they argued that only the state could impose such 
rules 
among the problems associated with constant work at a computer 
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers back and neck 
strain eyestrain sleep disturbances chronic headaches nausea 
and fatigue

twentyfive people were rescued 
after the ice they were fishing on broke free and drifted more than 
half a mile into a lake authorities say 
no one was injured sunday but 10 ice houses and three 
allterrain vehicles were left on the 5inchthick ice authorities 
said they would be recovered after the ice freezes back together 
probably in about two weeks 
one person told me they looked down at their fishing hole and 
noticed rocks going by and couldnt understand why the water was 
moving so rapidly said sheriffs deputy herb willis 
john odle owner of a resort on lake mille lacs said he barely 
managed to reach the shore before the ice broke free nineteen 
people were left on the floe which was about a halfmile long and 
a quartermile wide he said 
some were frantic and started to panic waving shirts to get 
attention odle said things got really crazy at this point 
odle and billy cawelti who operates a nearby resort rescued 
the 19 by boat he said the men along with rescue workers also 
brought four adults and two children to shore from another floe a 
halfmile away 
they were all very wet and one of the little boys was only 
wearing tennis shoes odle said 
willis said lake mille lacs usually does not break up this late 
in the year but warm weather and strong winds had opened a large 
hole in the middle of the lake allowing room for other chunks to 
break free and drift 
temperatures in the area this month have been in the 30s and 
40s the lake is about 60 miles north of minneapolis where it was

a surgeon disputed a colleagues claim to have 
contracted aids from being squirted in the face with blood during 
an operation they performed 
dr william knapper senior surgeon during the 1983 operation in 
which dr rudolph almaraz said he was exposed to aids denied any 
such accident took place but acknowledged not remembering specifics 
of the surgery or almaraz himself 
almaraz a breast cancer surgeon at johns hopkins hospital died 
of aids on nov 16 at age 41 never having told the hospital or his 
patients of his disease 
almarazs lawyer marvin ellin said the doctor told him a month 
before his death that he believed he was infected during an 
operation at the memorial sloankettering cancer center in new 
york 
although almaraz couldnt recall the date ellin said his review 
of almarazs operating records shows it must have been a 1983 
biopsy of a lymph node in the groin of an aids patient 
almaraz told me that while surgery was proceeding blood 
squirted in his face hitting him in the eyes and mouth ellin 
said 
but knapper who works at sloankettering said i can assure 
you that at no point in my career in any surgical procedure that i 
performed on an aids patient was there ever any accident that 
could have put me or my colleagues at risk for contracting aids 
at no point in my career was there ever an arterial spurt 
while i was doing a biopsy of a subcutaneous under the skin lymph 
node he said 
sloankettering officials has said no records exist of such an 
accident 
since almarazs death johns hopkins hospital has offered aids 
tests to 1800 of his patients two of them have sued saying they 
should have been told about his disease before being operated on

a weekend conference of the 
african national congress highlighted divisions between moderates 
eager to hold talks with the government and hardliners who want 
first to force more concessions 
the nations largest black opposition group ended its first 
public conference in 30 years with a 40000strong rally sunday 
the overall consensus during the threeday meeting was to 
maintain anc support for international trade sanctions and to urge 
protests and other pressure to ensure that president fw de klerk 
indeed dismantles apartheid 
the european community on saturday lifted its ban on new 
investment in south africa the first major crack in the wall of 
sanctions the anc has worked hard to build 
while opposition to apartheid remains european governments 
have decided that the best way to end it is by supporting de 
klerks initiatives rather than the ancs hard line said 
business day the countrys leading financial daily 
de klerk wants to open negotiations early next year with the anc 
and other opposition groups on a new constitution that will allow 
the 5 million whites and 30 million blacks to share power 
the overwhelming majority of our people and the delegates 
here support negotiations between the anc and the government 
said anc deputy president nelson mandela considered a moderate 
but joe slovo who also heads the south african communist party 
and is considered a hardliner in the anc said it seems to be 
the clear view of the conference that in order to get negotiaions 
proper going much much more has to get done by the whiteled 
government 
the rally in soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
marked the official homecoming of anc president oliver tambo who 
returned last week from 30 years in exile to attend the conference 
tambo said in a speech saturday that the anc should reconsider 
its advocacy of sanctions the government claims that sanctions 
hurt blacks and white alike by hurting south africas economy but 
anc leaders have seen them as a means of pressuring the government 
to end apartheid 
the anc said it would continue periodic talks with the 
government on dismantling apartheid that began in may 
but unless all barriers to fullscale constitutional 
negotiations are removed by april 30 the anc said it would 
consider withdrawing 
we shall not hesitate to recommend to suspend talks 
said chris hani head of the ancs military wing and one of the 
groups most militant leaders 
the anc says that before formal constitutional negotiations can 
begin the government must release political prisoners allow some 
20000 exiles to return home end political trials and scrap 
security legislation 
de klerk has agreed to the first three demands and has pledged 
to review security laws that have been used to restrict political 
activity 
however implementation has been delayed by bickering between 
the anc and the government over details hundreds of political 
prisoners remain in jail few exiles have returned and some trials 
involving anc activists accused of violence are still before the 
courts

storms off canadas coast have forced british 
tycoon richard branson and swedish balloonist per lindstrand to 
postpone until the new year their attempt at the first pacific 
crossing by hotair balloon 
lindstrand and branson had hoped to lift off later this week 
from miyakonojo a small town on the southern japanese island of 
kyushu 
but they said today that storms over the pacific had slowed the 
jet stream and pushed it too far south for a safe crossing 
to try to cross the worlds largest ocean at this time would 
pose too high a risk not only for ourselves but for others 
especially the rescue services who would be stretched over the 
christmas and new year period said branson founder of the 
virgin group and one of britains wealthiest men 
he said they would try to take off sometime in january 
branson and lindstrand have crossed the atlantic by balloon but 
failed to get off the ground in a transpacific attempt last year 
they have said they want to land somewhere in california 
japanese balloonist fumio niwa also has postponed his solo 
pacific crossing in a heliumfilled craft until next year 
he said he plans to try again on jan 11 
no one has ever crossed the pacific alone or in a hotair 
balloon although four men piloted a helium balloon across the 
ocean in 1981

nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner on monday restated the 
european allies willingness to wage war on iraq to force it out of 
kuwait if peaceful means are unsuccesful 
in brussels belgium the nato said the solidarity of all 
allies and their determination to implement in full the un 
security council resolutions against iraq remain firm 
 
secretary of state james a baker iii says he still hopes to 
revive the stalled american proposal for talks with saddam hussein 
but that no back channel talks are going on 
he said sunday on his way to the nato foreign ministers meeting 
that he wants to travel to baghdad to see saddam hussein by jan 3 
at the latest but he gave no indication saddam was about to agree 
to any of 15 dates from dec 20 through jan 3 acceptable to 
washington 
 
president bush had been scheduled to meet with iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz in washington on monday but the visit was put 
off by washington after saddam refused to set an early date for a 
return visit by baker 
saddam has offered to meet baker jan 12 three days before the 
un deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait or face military 
force but the bush administration has rejected that date as too 
close to the deadline

a military study says the united states had no 
conclusive evidence when it accused iraq of using chemical weapons 
against its kurdish minority in september 1988 
the report written by three analysts at the us army war 
college before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 also says that 
contrary to general belief iraqs rulers enjoy significant 
popular support 
the study examines iraqs performance in the iraniraq war that 
ended in july 1988 
claims that they iraq won simply by using massive amounts of 
chemical weapons cannot be substantiated concludes the study 
titled iraqi power and us security in the middle east 
leif rosenberger one of the authors said in a telephone 
interview from carlisle pa that the writers concluded that 
iraqs win over iran was pretty much an armor victory 
although both iraq and iran used chemical weapons during their 
eightyear war iraqs chemical superiority was overstated we 
thought rosenberger said iraq used chemical weapons as a 
defensive measure against iranian human wave attacks the study 
said 
the fundamental point to keep in mind we feel is that iraq 
won the war with iran because of its greater sacrifice said the 
study 
us officials have repeatedly cited baghdads possession of 
chemical weapons as the reason for taming iraqi president saddam 
hussein even if he were to leave kuwait 
imagine his saddams ability to blackmail his neighbors 
should he possess a nuclear device president bush said at a news 
conference earlier this month weve seen him use chemical 
weapons on his own people 
the war college report which was declassified and released to 
the public in the summer raises questions about whether saddam 
used chemical weapons against the kurdish minority in iraq in fall 
1988 
having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us 
we find it impossible to confirm the state departments claim that 
gas was used in this instance the authors said 
to begin with there were never any victims produced 
international relief organizations who examined the kurds 
failed to discover any the report said it said the claims rest 
solely on testimony of the kurds who have long sought autonomy 
from iraq 
conclusive evidence on the attack was never produced the 
study said 
col doug johnson another of the studys authors said the 
authors did not visit iraq or interview kurds to reach their 
interpretation instead they looked at published reports and at 
pictures he said in a telephone interview 
they concluded that the kurds had symptoms such as temporary 
blindness and skin blisters that are more commonly associated 
with attack by fuel air explosives rather than chemical weapons 
we recognize that there are observers who do not share our 
view on this the authors said adding that their conclusions did 
not necessarily represent the views of the war college or the army 
at the time turkish officials found no evidence of chemical 
weapons use when they screened the sick and injured among 60000 
kurdish refugees who fled across the border 
but seth carus of the washington institute for near east policy 
said he had doubts about the conclusion that iraq did not use 
chemical weapons against its own people in late 1988 
the evidence for use i think is fairly substantial carus 
said it would require a much more convincing case than they make 
to discredit the claim he said 
the war college study also deals with another incident in which 
kurds were killed by chemical gas in march 1988 in the city of 
halabjah 
iraq was blamed for the halabjah attack even though it was 
subsequently brought out that iran too had used chemicals in this 
operation and it seemed likely that it was the iranian bombardment 
that had actually killed the kurds the report said 
johnson said pictures from halabjah showed victims with blue 
mouths and hands which points to a cyanidebased gas the iranians 
not the iraqis are known to possess such gases that affect the 
blood he said 
several accounts reported iraqs alleged use of chemical weapons 
in the late summer of 1988 but iraq denied it 
on sept 8 1988 the state department accused iraq of the 
totally unjustified and abhorrent use of chemical weapons 
against the kurds then secretary of state george shultz lodged a 
protest with iraq but the department declined to say how it 
obtained its evidence 
two staffers from the senate foreign relations committee wrote a 
report in october 1988 saying overwhelming evidence exists that 
iraq used chemical weapons on kurdish civilians in a major 
offensive in northern iraq that began aug 25 1988 
they cited eyewitness accounts of kurdish refugees in turkey as 
did amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization in accusing iraq of using chemical weapons to kill 
hundreds of kurdish villagers

israeli police blocked thousands of 
palestinians from entering jerusalem today and barred arab youths 
from the historic mosques on the citys temple mount 
the heightened security was aimed at heading off clashes with 
jewish extremists and to prevent protests over israels decision to 
deport four moslem fundamentalist leaders from the occupied gaza 
strip 
in the west bank students at the closed bir zeit university 
held a march and stoned police to protest the planned deportations 
of the four activists members of the fundamentalist movement 
hamas israel radio reported 
police dispersed the demonstration with tear gas and rubber 
bullets and arrested four protesters it said 
officials anticipated angry reaction to the expulsions since 
palestinians many of whom were driven out of israel with the 
founding of the state in 1948 consider deportation from the 
occupied lands the worst possible punishment 
hamas or zeal is a fundamentalist group that has called for 
violence against isrelis recently hamas members murdered three 
israelis at a factory outside tel aviv on saturday 
the israeli army said the four were instigators of 
incitement but did not accuse them of direct involvement in the 
killings 
hundreds of paramilitary border police most in full riot gear 
were moved into jerusalem this morning to block the entry of 
palestinians from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
police teams were posted at gates to jerusalems old walled 
city and around the temple mount and arab residents of jerusalem 
who are under age 40 were turned away 
israel resurrected its controversial deportation policy to calm 
public anxiety over arab stabbing attacks on jews since the oct 8 
temple mount riots in which 17 palestinians were shot to death by 
police 
in jerusalem police denied a request by the jewish extremist 
group temple mount faithful to go up to the mount but more than a 
dozen members of the group defiantly marched nearby with four 
blueandwhite israeli flags 
tension over a planned march by the same group helped set off 
the temple mount riots 
police did not interfere today as the marchers went to the 
wailing wall at the foot of the mount and lit a candle to mark 
hanukkah the jewish festival of lights israel radio reported 
police detained four members of another extremist group the 
kach movement who were demonstrating by the wall the antiarab 
group was created by the late rabbi meir kahane slain last month 
by a gunman in new york city 
sixty arabs have been expelled during the threeyear palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation but israel had stopped the 
practice in august 1989 reportedly under us pressure 
the announcement of renewed deportations drew immediate 
criticism from us officials who charge that expelling people 
from the occupied territories violates international law 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post reported today that israeli 
officials viewed the us objections as pro forma 
but some israeli officials worried the deportation orders would 
weaken us resolve in fighting a un security council resolution 
that calls for a middle east peace conference which israel 
opposes 
us officials have approved such a conference in principle but 
they have fought recent attempts to introduce a un resolution 
saying that doing so now would give the appearance of rewarding 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
saddam has sought to liken his seizure of kuwait to israels 
1967 occupation of the west bank and gaza

the recent collision of two jets on the 
taxiway at detroit metropolitan airport was a rarity but there are 
dozens of close calls at airports around the nation each year 
safety officials say 
the national transportation safety board calls them 
incursions incidents in which pilots report that another 
airplane came dangerously close to theirs on the ground 
they have occurred as often as once every 12754 takeoffs or 
landings which is the ratio for such incidents during a 20month 
period at logan international airport in boston federal records 
show 
statistics published sunday in the detroit news showed that none 
of the incursions at other airports led to collisions but the 
incidents underscore a growing perception that they are becoming a 
major industry problem 
detroit had 24 close calls reported among 643000 operations 
during the 20month period that ended aug 31 the newspaper 
reported the ratio of incursions at 19 major us airports but not 
the actual number of occurrences 
weve been concerned for some time about runway incursions 
and this detroit accident has helped bring more attention to it 
said john lauber an investigator for the federal safety board 
in no way is it just a detroit problem it is a national 
problem he said 
eight people died dec 3 when two northwest airlines planes 
collided in fog at detroit metro one plane taxied onto the runway 
where the other was rushing toward takeoff 
the statistics were provided to the federal government by pilots 
who file reports with the aviation safety reporting system a 
program monitored by the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
the hazard potential the potential of a highspeed collision 
is great said david haase spokesman for the airline pilots 
association 
we feel there are several areas that need to be addressed to 
reduce the risk everything from hightech surface detection radar 
to changing phraseology used by airport personnel he said 
following are the 19 airports listed and the number of landings 
or takeoffs for every reported incursion

the convictions and 19year prison 
sentences handed down for the murder of environmentalist chico 
mendes are an important victory in the fight to preserve the 
dwindling amazon forest rubber tappers say 
this conviction is a landmark for environmentalists 
prosecutor sueli bellato said over the weekend 
a sevenmember jury determined late saturday that rancher darly 
alves da silva planned the dec 22 1988 slaying and that his son 
darci alves pereira fired the shotgun that killed the amazon union 
leader and rain forest defender 
prosecutors had said the ranchers had stained the forest 
with mendes blood and urged the maximum 30year sentence brazil 
has no death penalty 
now landowners know that every brother rubber tapper or 
environmentalist who dies will be avenged said francisco barbosa 
de aquino president of the rural workers union in this remote 
town 
defense attorney ruben torres said his clients would appeal 
mendes leader of the rubber tappers union became 
internationally known in his fight against ranchers who sought to 
expand their pastures by cutting down the rain forest the rubber 
tappers gather latex from forest trees 
he was gunned down on the back porch of his humble wooden house 
in this backwoods amazon river town 2650 miles northwest of rio de 
janeiro 
the fourday trial also drew world attention to a centuriesold 
battle over land in brazil that has left thousands of people dead 
only too often the perpetrators have gone unpunished 
the convictions are an important victory not only for the 
rubber tappers but for all the rural workers movements in 
brazil aquino said 
the amazon is the worlds largest rain forest and the only 
habitat for many plant and animal species rubber tappers depend on 
the forest for their livelihood 
once the jungle is cleared it becomes barren of most vegetation 
within a few years the race for development and quick profits 
wiped out vast swaths of the 2millionsquare mile wilderness 
land reform is a deeply divisive issue in this nation of 150 
million people larger in area than the 48 continental united 
states four percent of the population controls 60 percent of the 
arable land government surveys show 
president fernando collor de mello who took office march 15 as 
brazils first freely elected leader since l960 promised to give 
500000 families land by 1994 but he has not moved to fulfill the 
promise 
as brazils economy crumbles urban poor are flocking to the 
amazon to try to forge a new life on the frontier 
ranchers with little fear of reprisal from a corrupt justice 
system hire pistol men for as little as 25 to kill peasants 
or the roman catholic priests and other leaders who organize them 
since 1980 more than 1000 people have been killed in land 
disputes in brazil according to surveys by the pastoral commission 
for land 
in the first 11 months of this year 60 people died most of 
them poor farm hands and 403 were injured in battles over land 
the commission says 
convictions were achieved in only two cases the international 
human rights organization amensty international says 
satellite surveys show ranchers annually destroy an area the 
size of louisiana in the amazon which constitutes onethird third 
of the worlds remaining rain forest

a soviet envoy today opened talks with 
iraqi officials on their demand that moscow pay penalties to 
terminate the contracts of soviet workers in iraq 
a soviet diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
contract issue threatens to delay the departure from iraq of 2565 
soviet workers 
vladimir mordvinov a deputy minister at the soviet foreign 
economic relations ministry was meeting with acting oil minister 
hussein kamel and deputy prime minister sadoun hamadi 
another soviet sergei arakilyan a deputy minister at the 
petroleum refining and petrochemical ministry has been in baghdad 
for more than three weeks trying to work out agreements on oil and 
electrial contracts 
we would like to speed up the process take the necessary 
measures in baghdad soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly 
churkin said in moscow 
all the questions concerning soviets leaving baghdad are being 
discussed by representatives of the soviet government the 
purpose of that mission is to discuss with the iraqi side all the 
aspects of the stay of the soviet experts in iraq he said 
iraqs revolutionary command council decided dec 4 that all the 
remaining soviets can leave but it demanded that the soviet union 
compensate iraq for terminating their work contracts 
the soviet union said it was willing to pay compensation for 
breaking the contracts of the soviet workers 
however sources say the iraqis have not yet received an 
official pledge of payment from the soviet union and the two sides 
still have to agree on the amount and the payment schedule 
the soviet diplomat would not say if moscow is willing to pay 
the amount of compensation demanded by iraq neither side has 
disclosed the amount the iraqis are requesting 
the soviet diplomat said mordvinov will tell iraqi officials 
that moscow is prepared to comply with all international laws 
applicable in this case and the soviet union will abide by its 
obligations in the contracts 
iraq has slowed the processing of exit visas for the soviet 
workers and sources said the soviets are somewhat concerned that 
the iraqis want at least some of the soviets to stay on 
we proceed from the assumption that the iraqi leadership 
assured us that all soviet people have the chance to leave iraq and 
we proceed on the assumption that it is really so and we want those 
promises to be implemented churkin said in moscow when asked if 
iraq was trying to prevent soviets from leaving 
there were about 11000 soviets including 8000 soviet workers 
and several hundred military advisers in iraq on aug 2 when iraqi 
troops invaded kuwait 
churkin said there were 3316 soviets in iraq on dec 4 since 
then he said 751 soviets have left the country 
after the invasion of kuwait thousands of foreigners were 
prevented from leaving iraq and the occupied emirate and some 
mostly britons and americans were detained at strategic sites to 
prevent a feared attack 
some people were allowed to leave in response to appeals from 
foreign leaders earlier this month president saddam hussein said 
the others could go and most did so

president bush said today he still hopes for 
talks with iraq on resolving the persian gulf crisis but said 
iraqi forces must be out of kuwait by jan 15 and that means 
entirely bush would not say what hed do if the deadline wasnt 
met 
in remarks to reporters after introducing two new cabinet 
nominees bush said he was disturbed by saddam husseins weekend 
comments that there should be a holy war if necessary to permit 
iraq to keep kuwait 
iraqs invasion of that oilrich country on aug 2 touched off 
an international crisis and led to a united nations deadline of 
january 15 for iraq to leave kuwait the un resolution permits 
the use of force if iraq has not withdrawn its forces 
bush said he has heard from many people who say saddam may 
believe the united states is bluffing despite the deployment of up 
to 400000 troops into the middle east 
a lot of people who think they understand him dont feel that 
he believes we are serious they dont feel that he thinks we will 
use force 
some tell me as recently as yesterday that he feels that 
saddam hussein simply does not understand the debate in this 
country he thinks it means our country is divided and we cant go 
forward and hes just as wrong as he can be 
his demeanor seemed muted this morning and bush said in response 
to an inquiry that he was calmer than last friday when he 
lambasted saddam for rejecting us proposals for a date to meet 
with secretary of state baker

china did not support a un resolution 
authorizing force to liberate kuwait because of the world bodys 
role in the korean war foreign minister qian qichen said in an 
article published today 
qian told the communist partys peoples daily newspaper 
that china remains intent on finding a peaceful solution to the 
persian gulf crisis 
i believe it could take longer to achieve a peaceful solution 
but the losses would be less qian said 
before abstaining on the security council resolution authorizing 
a military strike to drive iraq from kuwait china had supported 
all other un resolutions aimed at pressing baghdad to withdraw 
its troops 
but we could not approve the proposal for some countries to 
take up arms and use military means under un authority qian 
said on this issue we have a historical responsibility the 
korean war launched in the name of the united nations remains fresh 
in the minds of the chinese people 
chinese officials have made similar comments in private talks 
with foreign diplomats in beijing but this is the first time the 
chinese publicly compared the korean war and sanctions against 
iraq 
chinese troops joined the north korean side against usled 
un troops in the 195053 war between the two koreas which have 
been split since the end of world war ii 
qian said china abstained on the resolution to make the 
international community continue to work for a peaceful solution 
the un security council voted 122 to allow a military strike 
against iraq if baghdad refuses to withdraw troops from kuwait by 
jan 15 china was the only permanent security council member that 
did not support the resolution 
the peoples daily interview is part of a new higher profile 
for qian 
the communist party magazine seek truth last week published 
a lengthy analysis by qian on chinas foreign policy there have 
been reports in hong kong that qian soon will be appointed vice 
premier

a drug commonly used as a sedative for 
children chloral hydrate may cause cancer in humans state 
scientists said 
in a letter sent last week to the us food and drug 
administration state health director kenneth kizer also urged the 
federal government to issue a warning and to conduct a study of 
the drugs effects in children who have already received it 
federal authorities said they would study the issue 
details of the problem were reported sunday by the sacramento 
bee 
kizer in the letter to fda commissioner david kessler said 
more than 20 animal and laboratory studies show evidence of chloral 
hydrates ability to alter genetic material and cause cancer in 
mice following a single oral dose 
another test expected to be completed by the us environmental 
protection agency later this month has shown that two out of five 
animals exposed to chloral hydrate developed liver tumors he said 
these finds raise serious concerns about carcinogenic risks 
associated with the use of this drug and the adequacy of warnings 
provided in labeling of chloral hydrate drug products kizer 
wrote 
interviews with health care professionals who prescribe 
dispense and administer chloral hydrate including neonatalogists 
pediatricians pedodontists and hospital pharmacists are unaware of 
the carcinogenic risks of this drug kizer added 
fda spokeswoman faye peterson said if there is solid evidence 
of the safety problem well be taking some action 
chloral hydrate the original mickey finn when used with 
alcohol has been used as a sedative and hypnotic since the 
mid1800s it has been considered a safe sedative for children 
because it doesnt depress the respiratory system also unlike 
many pediatric sedatives that are administered intravenously 
chloral hydrate is given orally in a sweetened syrup 
the drug is also widely used by radiologists who need children 
to hold still during lengthy diagnostic exams and by 
neonatalogists who routinely give it to newborns on ventilators 
because of its widespread use before the federal government 
began regulating drugs in 1938 chloral hydrate has never been 
subjected to the scientific scrutiny given new drugs according to 
the newspaper 
mary mortenson a pediatrician toxicologist and member of the 
drug committee of the american academy of pediatrics questioned 
whether animal studies on the carcinogenic effects of chloral 
hydrate can truly be applied to humans 
shouldnt we be seeing an epidemic of liver tumors in kids 
said mortenson who heads a poison control center in columbus 
ohio however she said the fda needs to seriously consider the 
california data

iraq today ordered 33yearold reservists 
to report for military duty its third major callup of reserves in 
recent weeks 
the ruling revolutionary command council also issued a statement 
of defiance on kuwait saying it wanted peace but would not cave in 
to demands by the united states and its allies 
the council said it rejected american attempts to impose a date 
for a meeting between saddam hussein and secretary of state james 
a baker iii the two sides have been unable to agree on a date for 
baker to visit baghdad 
baghdad newspapers reported the ministry of defense has recalled 
men born in 1957 to bolster the mobilization of almost 500000 
soldiers already in kuwait and southern iraq 
saddam said on nov 19 he would send 250000 men seven new 
divisions apparently drawn from reserve forces and 150000 
reservists and draftees 
the move came after president bush announced us forces in the 
persian gulf would be increased by about 200000 to almost 
450000 military personnel in the region by early january 
since then iraq has recalled about 60000 reservist farmers and 
an unknown number of others aged 30 31 and 32 
iraq has a force of 500000 regular soldiers and 480000 
reserves the sixth largest army in the world the country of 17 
million has about 900000 men aged 18 to 22 and 13 million aged 23 
to 32 according to the international institute for strategic 
studies 
the newspaper reports said recruiting offices had informed them 
that the 33yearolds should report to their units in a week the 
number of affected men was not known 
iraq usually recalls its reserves through statements read over 
state television and radio there was no explanation why that 
procedure was not followed this time 
after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait a usled multinational 
force assembled in the gulf to confront iraq a un resolution has 
authorized the use of force to liberate kuwait unless iraq 
withdraws its troops by jan 15 
iraq had suggested that foreign minister tariq aziz travel to 
washington today for talks there and that baker come to baghdad on 
jan 12 
the united states rejected that date saying it was too close to 
the jan 15 deadline set by the un security council for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait or face military action 
the revolutionary command council which is headed by saddam 
issued a statement broadcast over baghdad radio saying 
we seek peace we want dialogue for the sake of peace we 
respect legitimacy and seek the application of the international 
law on the nations causes however we reject capitulation 
it said the iraqi leaders reject the unilateral imposition of 
dates as the president of the usa wishes visavis the dialogue 
to which he agreed 
the statement said iraq was not afraid of the fleets and 
forces of oppression

fourteen former government officials 
including top national security experts said today the united 
states should not delay military action much beyond jan 15 if 
saddam hussein fails to withdraw his forces from kuwait 
i dont think we can just sit forever and depend on 
sanctions adm thomas moorer former chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff told reporters 
robert f ellsworth former deputy secretary of defense and a 
onetime gop congressman from kansas said saddam hussein will 
not respond to anything except a credible threat of immediate 
military action thats what will move him out of kuwait 
moorer and ellsworth released a letter that they and 12 other 
officials signed addressed to iraqi foreign minister tiraq aziz 
they said they had planned to deliver it to him during his visit to 
washington which was canceled 
the letter expressed support of president bush and the united 
nations security council in requiring iraqs immediate complete 
and unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
in the event of iraqs failure to comply the signers said 
we do not believe it wise or in the interest of international 
security to delay the use of all necessary means much beyond that 
date 
they noted the views of some in congress that military action 
should be delayed while sanctions are allowed to work but they 
urged aziz to advise saddam that such misguided views should not 
stand in the way of the use of all necessary force to enforce the 
un resolution 
moorer said war in the persian gulf is certainly probable 
but it is not totally certain 
others signing the letter were richard v allen and robert c 
mcfarlane both of whom served as national security advisers to 
former president reagan thomas c reed former secretary of the 
air force john f lehman former secretary of the navy retired

a founder of albanias first 
noncommunist political party said today his newly formed group was 
asking the government to postpone elections scheduled for february 
gramoz pashko was reached by telephone from vienna a day after 
he and an associate met with premier adil carcani to discuss 
legalizing the group the democratic party of albania 
pashko said he was asking for his party to be allowed to contest 
the feb 10 elections but would like them postponed by several 
months 
we dont have time to be well organized he said 
a spring election date would make it easier to organize a 
nationwide campaign in albania where very few people have access 
to cars and roads are often blocked by snow across the mountains 
that cover 70 percent of the nation 
in sundays meeting pashko asked carcani to legalize the party 
and create conditions for it to organize and operate as an 
independent political group 
the new party was created wednesday after the communist party 
reversed 45 years of oneparty rule and said it would allow 
formation of noncommunist political groups the decision followed 
four days of student protests 
pashko said the presidium of the peoples assembly the 
rubberstamp parliament was expected to issue a decree today on 
the formation of parties according to the decree the party would 
have to register within 30 days 
he said he also asked for a fair trial of those arrested after 
last weeks rioting in at least four cities and for foreign 
journalists to be allowed to visit albania only a handful of 
foreign journalists has been allowed in 
a spokesman for the democratic party genc pollo said on sunday 
that the group would seek formal registration with the justice 
minister this week 
earlier today a radio tirana editor speaking on condition of 
anonymity said by telephone that carcani praised the leaders of 
the new party for having taken a clear stand against the violent 
actions in albania last week 
in the meeting with carcani pashko said the founders of the 
new party presented their views about last weeks violence 
our stand was that of course we distance ourselves from 
these acts of vagabonds and hooligans he said but the founders 
also protested what he called provocations by some authorities 
and police he did not elaborate 
radio tirana in a russianlanguage broadcast monitored in 
vienna said carcani emphasized democracy could be achieved only 
through the path of dialogue it did not detail his response to 
the demands for legalization 
thousands of demonstrators burned and ransacked stores and other 
buildings in antigovernment riots in northern shkodra the port of 
durres nearby kavaje and central elbasan wednesday through friday 
several people were injured 
albanian chief investigator chemal ljama said 157 people would 
go on trial because of the violent protests the albanian radio 
editor said trials may begin as early as today 
ljama said those arrested were charged with illegitimate 
gatherings of plundering the wealth of the people as well as 
of carrying out acts of violence such as assassination attempts 
inflicting serious and slight injury the possible penalties 
were not known 
the three cities and the town of kavaje where rioting broke out 
wednesday were reported quiet today police and troops patrolled 
the streets 
communist president ramiz alia who has encouraged limited 
reforms in europes last hardline communist nation said on 
saturday that the criminal activity of rioters would not be 
tolerated 
alia has led the country in implementing reforms this year 
including lifting restrictions of religious practice 
the new party claims support of 20000 people in the country of 
32 million the communist party claims more than 120000 members 
the democratic party was formed by students and intellectuals 
last month parliament approved legislation allowing independent 
candidates to compete in secret ballot elections at the time the 
ruling party was adamantly opposed to pluralism

watching capitol hill these days brings to 
mind the old dan hicks song how can i miss you when you wont go 
away 
its been more than seven weeks since the 101st congress 
adjourned but many of its members are still around holding 
hearings issuing press releases and otherwise working to get on 
the nations airwaves and news pages 
the differences between an insession and an outofsession 
congress have been blurred in this age of instant communication and 
fast travel other than the actual votes on bills theres little 
that cannot be accomplished and lawmakers are wellpolished at 
working the system 
in its early days congress would meet for a few months in the 
winter afer which lawmakers would flee the summer moisture and 
heat of this sultry swamp city 
we pay them to be fulltime professional legislators now 
said stephen hess of the brookings institution members of the 
house now get 96600 while senators are paid 98400 
its not like the 19th century we give them not only a living 
wage but all of the staff they need to work at it when you combine 
that with jet planes air conditioning its a different 
attitude he said 
some still cling to the ideal of the citizenlawmaker the most 
recent popular expression of it can be found hess said in the 
drive for term limits 
but theres really no going back to the old days 
the stalemate in the persian gulf provides a vivid example of 
how the democraticcontrolled congress tries to exercise its powers 
when not in session 
even though congress is in recess they are still in the 
loop said jeff biggs whose boss house speaker thomas foley 
dwash has been working in his capitol office for most of the 
recess 
by holding hearings and generating publicity lawmakers can 
affect national policy without passing a single bill 
taking advantage of exposure on the national cspan cable 
network several committees in the house and senate have held 
hearings on the gulf while their legislative goal may still be 
unclear they have left no doubt that congress wants its views 
heard and prerogatives protected 
without those hearings the public would be left with the 
impression by the administration that no course other than 
military action would be effective in driving iraq from 
kuwait said david dreyer spokesman for house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo 
several experts including former top pentagon officials 
testified that the united states should give economic sanctions 
more time to work before considering an invasion 
the bush administration is in business 365 days a year 
spending 98 cents out of every federal dollar dreyer said 
its our job as an entity to spend just 02 percent to monitor 
how that is carried out 
of course good government isnt the only force that moves 
congress to work yearround 
because of the long legislative sessions many younger lawmakers 
put their children in school in the washington area so theyre in 
town anyway until the christmas break 
and not all of congress postsession activity is making members 
look good one of the mostwatched events has been the senate 
ethics committees hearings into whether five senators sold their 
influence to former savings and loan operator charles h keating 
jr 
lawmakers enthusiasm for hanging around the capitol does have 
its limits 
at a private meeting several members of the house armed 
services committee barked when they were told that chairman les 
aspin dwis scheduled two weeks of hearings ending just five 
days before christmas after so many weeks of testimony aspin was 
insisting on hearing from secondstring witnesses including 
university professors and think tank experts 
forced to absorb the brunt of the complaints was rudy deleon 
staff director of the panel said one lawmaker who requested 
anonymity aspin himself was stuck in milwaukee due to another sign 
of the season a winter storm 
perhaps it was a sign from dan hicks

withdrawal from kuwait 
reiterating their readiness to wage war against iraq as early as 
next month if necessary the nato foreign ministers said a 
complete iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and the restoration of the 
sovereignty and legitimate government of kuwait are unequivocal 
conditions for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
there can be no partial solutions said the statement issued 
on the opening day of a twoday nato foreign ministers meeting it 
called the iraqi seizure of kuwait on aug 2 a flagrant violation 
of international law

contempt for united nations resolutions imposed to try to force 
it out of kuwait

for a meeting between iraqi president saddam hussein and secretary 
of state james a baker iii the iraqi council said in a statement 
that iraq does not fear the fleets and forces of oppression

the gulf crisis with his nato counterparts along with his stalled 
efforts to start direct talks with iraq 
while the allies said they hoped war could be averted in the 
gulf they reaffirmed their pledge to abide by all un 
resolutions including one adopted nov 29 that authorizes the use 
of force unless iraq withdraws from kuwait by jan 15 
the responsibility now lies with the government of iraq to 
ensure peace by complying fully with the mandatory united nations 
decisions the foreign ministers statement said 
nato secretary general manfred woerner opened the meeting by 
saying the allies are determined that the brutal aggression and 
violation of international law committed by saddam hussein in 
invading kuwait will not be allowed to stand 
the solidarity of all allies and their determination to 
implement in full the security council resolutions against iraq 
remain firm he added 
woerner did not say anything about increasing north atlantic

to the individual nato countries all of them except iceland 
luxembourg germany and turkey have troops naval units or 
warplanes in the gulf region 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz was to have met with president 
bush in washington today but the meeting was scuttled by a

2565 soviets 
britains ambassador to kuwait and his consul flew to jordan 
from baghdad today en route home to london they were the last two 
western diplomats to leave kuwait 
the us embassy in kuwait was evacuated last week upon 
completion of saddams blanket hostage release the iraqi president

abbas leader of the palestine liberation front as saying squads 
have been prepared to strike american targets worldwide if war 
breaks out 
abbas whose followers hijacked a cruise ship in 1985 and killed 
a american passenger was quoted as saying if war flares up it 
will not go the same direction as planned by the american 
administration the united states does not have the final decision 
to confine it to a limited area 
by the middle of next month washington will have deployed more 
than 400000 troops in the gulf region the allies have committed 
smaller forces britain with 30000 troops and france with 10000

president mikhail s gorbachev today called for a 
national referendum to decide whether to hold the 15 soviet 
republics together on the basis of his proposed union treaty 
we must not let the union disintegrate this would have a 
devastating effect on millions of people he said in a state of 
the union message to the congress of peoples deputies 
just after the 2250member congress convened today a deputy 
who said she was ashamed that her country is accepting foreign food 
aid took to the podium and issued an emotional call for gorbachevs 
resignation 
the call for a noconfidence vote was rejected but the 
political divisions that threaten the survival of the soviet state 
were abundantly evident 
nevertheless gorbachev said that by working together the soviet 
people can overcome the crisis within 18 months 
we have learned a lesson we should not be 
panicstricken he said 
gorbachev urged the congress to approve proposed constitutional 
amendments to strengthen the presidency adding the post of vice 
president and replacing the 89member council of ministers with a 
cabinet of about 15 people 
gorbachev aides say it is unlikely that nikolai ryzhkov who 
heads the council of ministers and who is widely blamed for the 
failure of the nations economic reform will remain prime minister 
in the government reshuffle 
before the congress opened in the kremlin today gorbachevs 
aides indicated the soviet leader wanted the body to endorse his 
union treaty 
delegates from the republics of lithuania and armenia were 
boycotting the meeting and lawmakers from estonia and latvia said 
they would not take part in discussions of the treaty 
we must take strong measures to halt separatist nationalist 
actions gorbachev said in proposing the referendum he said the 
results of the referencum in every republic will be a final 
verdict but it was not clear when the referendum would be held 
or how it would be administered 
the congress the countrys highest lawmaking body has the 
right to approve the proposed constitutional changes but only the 
republics have the power to approve the proposed union treaty 
gorbachev apparently sought to remove the decisionmaking power 
from separatist republics in favor of a direct vote 
gorbachevs chief political rival president boris n yeltsin of 
the russian republic did attend the congress session gorbachev 
offered yeltsin who heads the largest richest and most populous 
republic the empty chair next to him on the podium and the two men 
shook hands but did not speak 
yeltsin is leading a movement among the 15 soviet republics to 
wrest economic control from the central government 
the conflict has set off economic and administrative turmoil 
contributing to the food shortages that have in the past month 
prompted gorbachev to seek and secure western credits food and 
medical supplies 
the congress has largely supported gorbachevs initiatives and 
its previous three gatherings have been momentous 
the most recent last spring amended the constitution to end 
the communist partys guaranteed monopoly on power 
but rival parties have been slow to gain strength and gorbachev 
seemed unlikely to face an organized challenge from either radical 
reformers or hardliners in the congress 
the radical interregional group on friday ended a twoday 
caucus without agreeing on a common platform and on saturday 
members of the hardline soyuz or union movement said they would 
back gorbachevs proposals 
last month some soyuz members demanded gorbachev declare a 
state of emergency suspend elected legislatures and political 
movements in rebellious republics or step down 
gorbachev responded by replacing the moderate interior minister 
with a kgb general and ordered a crackdown on the pilfering and 
profiteering that have exacerbated food shortages and the collapse 
of the state distribution system 
several of gorbachevs senior allies have come out with strong 
lawandorder speeches in recent days threatening separatists and 
black marketeers 
the presidents aides say the tough talk is meant to appease 
hardliners not to signal that the soviet leader is abandoning 
reform they say gorbachev needs to rally conservatives who in 
many cases control transportation and distribution networks so his 
reforms to survive the winter 
in the call for a noconfidence vote sazhi umalatova a 
communist party member from the chechenongush autonomous republic 
in the russian republic accused the president of bringing 
devastation hunger cold blood tears to the people 
fellow lawmakers sat in stunned silence and a national audience 
watched on live television as umalatova accused gorbachev of 
destroying the country 
umalatovas call for vote of no confidence in gorbachev was 
rejected by a vote of 1288 to 426 with 183 abstentions

nasas poor maintenance practices have caused a 
fire in a mission control room falling concrete in a space shuttle 
building and a steam line explosion according to a government 
report issued today 
the general accounting office report says the national 
aeronautics and space administration is working to correct the 
shortcomings congress appropriated 141 million for maintenance in 
1990 and more has been asked for future years 
the gao recommends that the space agency develop a comprehensive 
maintenance strategy spend more money on upkeep and do annual 
surveys to determine which of its centers most need repairs 
people and facilities are critical to mission success said 
sen barbara mikulski dmd who released a summary of the report 
today we cant afford breakdowns on the ground if were going to 
have spectaculars in space 
the report said launch pads and the space shuttle processing 
facilities are generally wellmaintained but it said that eight 
nasa centers visited by gao inspectors all have deteriorating 
facilities such as leaking roofs peeling paint and leaking steam 
lines many of nasas buildings are 30 to 50 years old 
the report said nasa rated its own facilities as marginal 
an example of deterioration is concrete falling from the roof 
of the 52story building where the shuttle is joined with the 
external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters 
nasa installed netting beneath the roof deck to catch the 
concrete the summary said 
other incidents included a cooling tower that partially 
collapsed under the weight of ice that formed because water valves 
malfunctioned the report said 
experts at the national research council recommend that agencies 
spend at least 2 percent to 4 percent of their facilities 
replacement value on maintenance the report said 
the percentage for most of nasas facilities between 1985 and 
1989 was between 09 percent and 15 percent it said 
mikulski said this years federal budget includes a special 20 
million fund to start rehabilitation and major maintenance at 
nasas field centers 
the space agencys facilities include 2700 buildings and 3200 
other major structures encompassing 36 million square feet

in remarks to reporters after introducing two new cabinet 
nominees bush said he was disturbed by saddam husseins weekend 
comments that there should be a holy war if necessary to permit 
iraq to keep kuwait 
bush vowed anew that iraq must not be allowed to profit from its 
takeover of kuwait 
weve got an opportunity for a new world order but that 
opportunity will be lost if an aggressor gets one single 
concession its important that the man understand that were 
serious about this 
bush also met with ambassador nathaniel howell who kept the 
us embassy in kuwait open despite pressure from baghdad howell 
said iraq was winterizing military bunkers in kuwait prompting a 
reporter to comment aloud that it doesnt bode well for us 
bush replied it doesnt bode well for saddam hussein 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 touched off an international 
crisis and led to a united nations deadline of january 15 for 
iraq to leave kuwait the un resolution permits the use of force 
if iraq has not withdrawn its forces 
bush said he has heard from many people who say saddam may 
believe the united states is bluffing despite the deployment of up 
to 400000 troops into the middle east 
a lot of people who think they understand him dont feel that 
he believes we are serious they dont feel that he thinks we will 
use force 
some tell me as recently as yesterday that he feels that 
saddam hussein simply does not understand the debate in this 
country he thinks it means our country is divided and we cant go 
forward and hes just as wrong as he can be 
his demeanor seemed muted this morning and bush said in response 
to an inquiry that he was calmer than last friday when he 
lambasted saddam for rejecting us proposals for a date to meet 
with secretary of state james a baker iii 
bushs comments came after several days of international 
jockeying over dates for direct talks between american and iraqi 
diplomats iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz had been due in 
washington today to meet with the president but that visit was put 
off when the two sides could not agree on a date for bakers visit 
to baghdad 
i hope these talks will take place he said but he 
repeatedly sidestepped questions on what he would do if there were 
no talks and if iraq did not comply with the withdrawal deadline 
bush accused saddam on friday of refusing to see baker until too 
close to the jan 15 deadline set by the united nations for a 
withdrawal from kuwait he repeated his accusation today saying 
again that the united states had offered saddam 15 separate dates 
for bakers trip 
bush has said he wants baker to meet with saddam no later that 
jan 3 asked what difference nine day makes saddam has proposed 
a jan 12 date bush replied 
if i thought that meeting on the 14th would permit him to 
comply fully with the un resolutions id be very flexible but 
thats not possible 
in reference to the iraqi leaders weekend comments bush said 
he keeps making these statements that fly directly in the face of 
the international positions taken by the un security council

prime minister chandra shekhar said 
monday he is prepared to use any amount of force needed if 
dialogue fails to halt the hindumoslem riots that have claimed 
more than 300 lives in the past 10 days 
certain people are trying to create trouble they are 
exploiting this thing he said in an interview with the 
associated press 
the sectarian violence helped bring down his predecessor prime 
minister vp singh about a month ago parliament then gave 
chandra shekhar a vote of confidence to form a new government 
he said monday he was optimistic that dialogue could defuse the 
sectarian rivalries and fears that have spurred hindus and moslems 
to murderous riots in several cities mobs have slaughtered infants 
with axes burned people alive and lynched passengers on passing 
trains 
it is very difficult to grapple with the situation chandra 
shekhar said we want to deal with the situation with restraint 
and patience 
however he said if dialogue fails and if these things dont 
stop any amount of force needed will be used in order to stop the 
situation 
we have already initiated some processes and we are trying to 
have a dialogue with different religious communities he said 
chandra shekhar a veteran politician tends to speak in 
political platitudes in public but he has a reputation for 
toughminded effectiveness when it comes to wheeling and dealing in 
private with his friends and foes 
the hindumoslem riots erupted when hindu fundamentalists 
renewed their campaign to build a temple on a site occupied by a 
mosque in northern ayodhya singhs government fell when he lost 
the support of a hindu rightwing party during an attempt to build 
the temple in late october 
since then members of indias hindu majority and moslem 
minority have attacked each other with a ferocity that has little 
parallel since 1947 when the british colonial asian subcontinent 
was partitioned into mostly hindu india and overwhelmingly moslem 
pakistan 
chandra shekhar took office as the leader of the janata 
dalsocialist party a breakaway faction of singhs janata dal 
party his rise to power was made possible only by support from his 
longtime political enemy former prime minister rajiv gandhi 
leader of the congress party 
chandra shekhar said his willingness to make political deals and 
engage in dialogue should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness 
he said he was more interested in running the country than in 
trying to figure out how long his minority government would last 
on friday he said he soon would present a new peace plan for 
punjab where sikh extremists have killed more than 3100 people 
this year the highest annual toll since they launched their 
separatist campaign in 1982 
the only thing i offer is that i am ready to talk with anybody 
who is an indian and who is ready to negotiate and discuss and 
settle this issue within the framework of the indian 
constitution he said in the interview monday at his official 
residence 
he said selfdetermination could be discussed under the 
purview of the indian constitution a restriction that would 
rule out the independent nation demanded by some sikh radicals 
on kashmir where more than 1600 people have died this year as 
indian troops try to put down a moslem secessionist movement 
chandra shekhar said there is no limit to his willingness to 
negotiate 
but he reiterated the views of all previous indian governments 
that a plebiscite for kashmirs selfdetermination is out of the 
question 
most of the problems of this nation of 880 million people 
whether religious political or economic can be traced to needs 
for greater development chandra shekhar said 
a socialist since his university days the 63yearold prime 
minister said socialism was still the answer to equalize 
humanity but this did not mean dogmatic adherence to the 
socialist models of other nations 
he said he would not shut the door to foreign investment but 
india must choose carefully before deciding what sort of products 
and technology are needed 
our problem is that we are a scarceresource area we cannot 
squander our resources for something that is not essential 
chandra shekhar said we should not try to ape the western 
world 
he acknowledged having little affinity for international 
relations unlike the political dynasty of prime ministers 
jawaharlal nehru indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi the dynasty 
governed independent india for all but four years in the nations 
43year history 
i am a man who knows very little about foreign affairs and i 
am not much interested but there is some meeting in january he 
said apparently referring to the commonwealth summit just to 
discharge my duties i shall go to the foreign countries 
improving ties with pakistan which whom india has shared a 
border and animosity since they became independent from britain 
was more important he said 
he said he and pakistans new prime minister nawaz sharif have 
set up a hot line that they have used twice in the past month he 
did not say what they discussed

three senators have asked mikhail gorbachev 
for help in resolving unanswered questions about the 1983 
destruction of a korean airliner carrying 269 passengers including 
a georgia congressman 
sen sam nunn dga sen carl levin dmich and sen edward 
kennedy dmass wrote gorbachev last month in an appeal for 
information on whether the wreckage of the plane or the remains of 
its passengers or any of their effects were located 
although the letter was sent to the soviet president nov 14 
aides said monday the senators have received no response 
this unanswered question is a constant troubling burden for 
the families and relatives of the americans who perished on the 
flight the senators wrote 
sixtythree americans including rep larry mcdonald dga 
were among those presumed killed when korean air lines flight 007 
was shot down sept 1 1983 by a missile fired from a soviet 
fighter plane 
the plane was far off course over the soviet island of sakhalin 
north of japan when it was shot down 
soviet authorities gave american and japanese officials some 
items recovered from the plane several weeks after it was shot 
down but they have never acknowledged whether they found the main 
wreckage or any of the remains of the victims 
the soviet union has maintained the airliner was on a spy 
mission for the united states and deliberately violated soviet air 
space it also has contended that the pilot of the soviet fighter 
didnt know he was firing at a civilian airliner 
the united states has denied the spying charges as well as 
soviet contentions that american air traffic monitors knew the 
plane was flying into soviet air space but failed to radio the 
korean crew to change course

here are excerpts of the statement on 
the persian gulf crisis issued monday by nato foreign ministers 
iraqs invasion and brutal occupation of kuwait represent a 
flagrant violation of international law and the charter of the 
united nations and pose a fundamental challenge to international 
order 
we condemn iraqs consistent contempt for the resolutions of 
the united nations security council which reflect the overwhelming 
solidarity and commitment of the international community 
iraqs behavior threatens peace 
it jeopardizes the unprecedented opportunity for the united 
nations to realize the original vision of its role in promoting 
global peace and stability 
the responsibility now lies with the government of iraq to 
ensure peace by complying fully with the mandatory united nations 
decisions 
a complete iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and the restoration 
of the sovereignty and legitimate government of kuwait are 
unequivocal conditions for a peaceful solution there can be no 
partial solutions 
we firmly support un resolution 678 and all other relevant 
resolutions adopted by the security council and reiterate our hope 
that their implementation can be achieved by peaceful means 
we are confident that a contact between the presidency of the 
european community and the foreign minister of iraq among other 
initiatives can make a contribution to this purpose we also 
encourage action by the un secretary general to this end in 
particular we support efforts for a dialogue such as those made 
by president bush to provide iraq through direct highlevel 
contacts with the clearest possible understanding of the 
consequences of further postponing the fulfillment of its 
obligations 
we agree that iraq must not use these initiatives to delay 
meeting the jan 15 date established by the united nations 
security council resolution 678 has authorized the use of all 
necessary means if iraq does not comply before that date and has 
expressly called on all governments to provide appropriate support 
in implementing the resolutions adopted by the security council 
our countries will continue to respond positively to this 
united nations request each of us undertakes to provide 
further support for this continuing effort in line with evolving 
requirements 
we note that the crisis in the gulf poses a potential threat 
to one of our allies having common borders with iraq and we 
reaffirm that an armed attack against one of our states shall be 
considered an attack against them all

california billionaire kirk kerkorian may turn a 
quick tidy profit on the 272 million he has invested in the 
struggling chrysler corp according to some analysts 
a variety of scenarios including a takeover bid have 
surfaced since fridays news that kerkorian bought 98 percent of 
chryslers stock becoming the companys largest shareholder 
in a report filed today with the securities and exchange 
commission kerkorian said he has plans to buy more chrysler stock 
and does not immediately intend an extraordinary corporate 
transaction such as a merger reorganization or liquidation 
a chrysler statement friday said the company would not comment 
on his motives for such an investment as chrysler announced the 
purchase it said its board of directors lowered the threshold for 
the companys poison pill antitakeover provision to kick into 
action 
previously if a shareholder collected 20 percent of the stock 
other shareholders could buy stock at lessthanmarket value on 
friday the board halved that to 10 percent 
kerkorian known as a shrewd investor said he would consider 
general economic money and stock market conditions in determining 
whether to buy more chrysler shares 
he said in the sec report that his actual stake in chrysler as 
of last friday was 22 million shares or 977 percent the stock 
was purchased mostly on the open market at the new york stock 
exchange between oct 11 and nov 16 at prices ranging from 1050 
to 1125 
kerkorian has told chrysler chairman lee iacocca he was a 
passive investor 
but chryslers lack of acknowledgement that the purchase was 
solely for investment and its directors move on the poisonpill 
language started speculation about kerkorians motives 
william steele of dean whitter reynolds inc in san francisco 
doubted kerkorians passive investor characterization 
it seems to me that a passive investor is somebody whos after 
dividends and price appreciation he said his past history 
doesnt show that he is a passive person 
analysts saw little chance of kerkorian or anyone else buying 
chrysler then breaking it up and spinning off say its profitable 
jeep or minivan business or its chrysler financial corp 
subsidiary 
breaking up the car and ruck business would likely cause an 
instant war with the united auto workers union two years ago 
chrysler tried to sell its acustar parts subsidiary and the uaw 
immediately took to the streets the attempt eventually was 
scuttled 
general motors corp ford motor co and especially chrysler 
face intense pressure these days from slumping sales and rising 
labor costs all under the threat of a continued economic downturn 
analysts have speculated that dividends for the big three may be 
lowered gms and fords stand at 75 cents a share and chryslers 
at 30 cents 
nevertheless analysts acknowledge that chryslers stock is 
undervalued after kerkorians announcement it closed friday at 
1225 a share unchanged from thursday 
that makes chrysler a good investment some analysts and 
investors say 
most people assume this is nothing more than someone who views 
the stock as undervalued said michigan state treasurer robert 
bowman the state controls about 65 million shares or about 3 
percent of chryslers outstanding stock 
analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york said the 
investment made sense 
barring a nuclear war in the middle east he gets his money 
back said brady whos bullish on the big three 
analysts were waiting to see what kind of reaction wall street 
would have this week 
typically when a large investor sinks that much into a company 
the move is viewed as an endorsement of the company 
early friday afternoon just before the announcement of the 
purchase trading on chrysler stock was halted trading resumed 
after about two hours time enough for the news to sink in 
chryslers move on its poisonpill provision healy said caused 
the market to shrug it off

a year after their peaceful 
revolution czechoslovaks are snapping up a new board game that 
makes fun of the communists who ruled their nation for four 
decades 
the game called building a monument to stalin takes 
satirical aim at the relics of communist rule marxist education 
the secret police bureaucratic pettiness and corruption 
players roll the dice and draw cards giving instructions that 
could have been chillingly real before they took to the streets 13 
months ago and toppled their hardline leaders 
participating in an unauthoized demonstration the water 
cannon pushed you back five spaces says one card 
after a night at the communist youth disco you come down with 
venereal disease bribe the doctor 2000 crowns says another 
visiting a soviet army base the extra three glasses of vodka 
with which you washed down the boiled carp made you sick miss two 
turns says a third 
the monopolylike game sells for 50 crowns the equivalent of a 
nice restaurant lunch 
before they can start the game players must put it together 
with scissors and glue even assembling makeshift paper dice 
thats a pointed reminder of the communistera consumer practice 
of scrounging in shops for makeshift goods patching together what 
they were lucky enough to find or buy 
although they can joke now about the economic hardships under 
the communists czechoslovaks are bracing for even tougher times as 
their country makes the painful switch to a market economy 
this may be the last time we can laugh about how stupid the 
communists were and still have a good meal for dinner said 
martina klementova a 34year old teacher 
the goal of the game is to win control of sites along the board 
and build a monument to the late soviet dictator a reallife 
monument to stalin a gargantuan statue once towered over 
prague but it was dismantled 
players roll the dice to determine rewards the chance to study 
at a university or even become party general secretary or 
punishment such as detention by police 
the game can be found in department stores as well as at small 
stands in the metro and it has been selling briskly its inventor 
a 39yearold writer is a little disconcerted by its success 
i heard about this in a pub from a guy who spent 10 years in 
jail and devised something along these lines just to kill time 
said petr sabach 
several years later i started scribbling something similar on 
the table of the same pub and in less than a day i was 
finished he said 
the game is also sold in neighboring poland which also recently 
shook off communist rule sabach said he and the producer had made 
33000 from sales 
the son of a ministry clerk and an army colonel who was a 
communist party member sabach says the things the game makes fun 
of were part of his childhood 
these things were with me ever since i was born whether i 
liked it or not he said 
jana savrdova a 25yearold waitress says the game is fun 
and yet it reminds one of the notsoold times when something 
like this was actually dangerous she said

a ride aboard a soviet spacecraft and a visit to 
the space station mir await the winner of a national sweepstakes to 
be conducted by a company here executives said today 
the sweepstakes dubbed the ultimate adventure will accept 
entries beginning today from any interested person who is 
willing to call a 900 telephone number and enter for a fee of 
299 
he or she need not be a test pilot or a scientist or a 
government official according to a release from space travel 
services corp the butcher the baker the candlestick maker are 
all eligible it could be your neighbor it could be you 
space travel president david mayer said the company has 
contracted for a oneweek stay on mir there has been no 
independent confirmation from soviet officials 
the lucky person will be selected in december 1991 by the 
houston office of kpmg peat marwick an accounting firm 
the winner also could take a cash payment of 15 million 
instead of the flight 
space travel services said because of local laws people listing 
addresses in new york florida or rhode island would not be 
eligible for the flight 
our longterm business strategy is to arrange for space travel 
opportunities for anyone who wishes to go into space said james 
davidson senior vice president of space travel services to 
introduce this service and our company to the general public weve 
arranged for a little sweepstakes the trip to the mir space 
station is the ultimate adventure 
the national aeronautics and space administration suspended its 
plans to have civilians accompany astronauts in space after the 
1986 challenger disaster 
the soviets for a hefty price have transported passengers of 
a variety of nationalities to their space station for stays of 
varying duration they have included a frenchman a cuban and an 
east german the tokyo broadcasting service recently paid 12 
million to the glavkosmos sapace agency for japanese journalist 
toyohiro akiyamas ride 
but theres never been an american 
 
i would say its a very natural evolutionary activity said 
art dula whose houstonbased space commerce corp markets soviet 
space services in the united states and negotiated the deal on 
behalf of space travel services 
ive been doing this business with the soviets since 1986 
he said i have found the soviets are very flexible they do not 
have a large bureaucracy i have found they are willing to consider 
anything beneficial and not harmful i found they thought this was 
rather innovative 
a woman at the kpmg peat marwicks houston office said she was 
unaware of the sweepstakes but said others who might know were not 
immediately avaiable 
space travel said it would pay the guest cosmonaut expenses for 
the trip the preflight training which could take as much as six 
months and other expenses 
the company said the winner would have to pass a soviet physical 
examination the preflight training is to include physical 
training plus russianlanguage training 
the flight is expected to occur in late 1992 or early 1993 the 
winner would accompany two soviet cosmonauts rendezvous with the 
space station and spend about a week there in orbit 
the company is described as being founded this year by a group 
of space enthusiasts who want to make a positive change in peoples 
attitudes toward space and space travel according to a release 
mayer is described as the executive vice president and 
cofounder of space city construction services a commercial 
construction contractor

an indepth study of the soviet economy 
concludes that massive western aid at this time would be wasted 
because the countrys economic system is in such disarray official 
sources said monday 
instead an extensive infusion of technical assistance to help 
carry out fundamental economic reforms will be recommended 
according to sources familiar with the report due to be released 
this week 
basically the problems are structural which no amount of 
external aid will solve one soviet specialist said monday 
the sources speaking on condition they not be identified 
characterized the findings as pessimistic and depressing because 
they describe a system even more backward than expected and 
practically paralyzed by inefficiency and confusion 
no amount of aid will make a real difference the system 
simply cannot absorb it the pipe is so porous that very little 
would reach its intended target said ilya prizel of the johns 
hopkins school for advanced international studies 
the study conducted by the international monetary fund world 
bank and two europeanbased development groups comes on the heels 
of a weekend summit at which western leaders ordered 1 billion in 
emergency aid for the soviets and approved spending more than that 
amount on technical assistance during the next two years 
prizel said a political statement in the form of food aid to 
help soviets get through the winter might shore up president 
mikhail s gorbachev or even help induce the kinds of reform that 
are necessary 
but prizel said what they need is technical assistance 
everything from entrepreneurial and managerial assistance to 
logistical assistance as well as traditional advice such as how 
to set up a central bank 
gorbachev recently won legislative approval of a compromise plan 
for moving from a centrally planned command economy to one 
controlled by market forces one source said the study provides the 
most thorough analysis yet of how colossal a task that will be 
the soviet currency the ruble is not traded on international 
exchanges and its value inside the country is in a free fall the 
price of goods bears little or no relationship to the cost of 
production inflation is accelerating at a pace difficult to 
measure and manufacturing plants are almost universally old 
inefficient and unable to compete in world markets 
the soviet union has no central bank as the institution is 
generally understood in the west the concept of property law is in 
its infancy the work ethic is practically unknown and generally 
accepted principles of organizational management are foreign to 
most soviets in managerial positions 
the most visible result of such pervasive problems is the 
widespread shortage of food and consumers goods in major soviet 
cities but the study considers that merely symptomatic of an 
economic system that doesnt work and cant be made to work the 
sources said 
john hardt a specialist on the soviet economy at the library of 
congress said an international assistance program would make sense 
if gorbachev establishes a central banking system and moves to 
retain a common currency common tariffs and control of the 
infrastructure and foreign economic policy so foreign investors 
know who theyre dealing with 
however he said any aid program should be conditioned on the 
soviets imposing basic economic stabilization measures which are 
threatened by fractious political forces demanding that the 
constituent republics set up their own independent economies 
president bushs proposal last week to give the soviets a 
special association status in the imf and world bank paved the 
way for giving technical assistance and training without immediate 
economic aid 
the new category would be short of full membership which the 
soviets are seeking and which would be required before they could 
receive institutional assistance 
one official also said the study would go a long way to 
defining the size of their economy 
western analysts say the soviet union ranks anywhere from no 2 
in the world to a mere 3 or 4 percent of the world economy 
depending on how gross national product is measured 
when you provide assistance to a country to help restructure 
its domestic economy you have to make sure there is a domestic 
economy that it has some ability to absorb the assistance and some 
ability to do the kinds of fundamental economic things that are 
necessary like price liberalization the source said 
asked about growing political pressure in the west to ship food 
and medical aid to relieve shortages and buttress the gorbachev 
regime one imf source said 
humanitarian assistance is really quite different from 
economic assistance that is the kind of assistance that just 
buys time until the leaves come back on the trees the kind of 
assistance they need is far more than that

the european communitys 
lifting of its ban on new investment in south africa shows the 
wests growing faith in president fw de klerks pledge to end 
apartheid 
the weekend move by ec leaders in rome marked the first major 
reversal of international sanctions which have been used as a 
punitive measure against south africas institutionalized racism 
the decision came despite african national congress leader 
nelson mandelas urging that the ec delay a decision the anc the 
countrys leading black opposition group reaffirmed its support 
for sanctions hours before the europeans acted 
more important than the immediate ending of the investment 
embargo is the psychological lift the ec statement has given 
president de klerk the countrys leading finanicial daily 
business day said monday 
while opposition to apartheid remains european governments 
have decided that the best way to end it is by supporting de 
klerks initiatives rather than the ancs hard line it said 
in ending the nonbinding investment ban the ec praised de 
klerks reforms that so far have eliminated some apartheid laws 
legalized banned opposition groups and freed mandela from prison 
after 27 years 
still in place though are ec bans on importing iron steel and 
gold coins from south africa and exporting military hardware to the 
whiteled government

aristide escaped unharmed when thugs armed with machetes knives 
and pikes attacked the same church during mass killing 12 
parishioners and wounding 70 others 
the assailants burned the church to the ground 
no other violence was immediately reported today in haiti where 
the presidential and legislative election had been conducted

election joao de medicis of brazil head of a un observation 
team and a representative of un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said earlier today 
de medicis told reporters there were some voting irregularities 
but in our opinion these irregularities did not affect the 
results he did not elaborate on the irregularities or results 
in washington the state department praised the peaceful and 
orderly conduct of elections in haiti and urged all parties to 
respect the official results when they are announced 
no official figures were expected to be available until later 
today but the consensus of some politicians and observers based 
on partial returns and talks with election officials was that 
aristide would win a clear majority 
haitians also seemed sure the priest would be their next 
president 
thousands of people poured into the streets dancing and 
singing aristide president and shouting now the people 
have power they waved posters with aristides picture and green 
branches the traditional haitian symbol of celebration

the official returns local radio and television stations were 
barred by law from broadcasting partial results some stations got 
around the embargo by relaying foreign shortwave radio broadcasts

weve won they couldnt steal our election from us said 
pierre merveille a 42yearold bus driver and aristide supporter 
the international airport reopened today to arriving flights 
which had been canceled on sunday in case of disturbances 
the election was hampered by delays in the delivery of ballots 
and the opening of poll booths that kept hundreds of voters 
simmering in long lines under the sun and leading some to charge 
fraud 
the new government will replace the caretaker administration of 
president ertha pascaltrouillot a supreme court justice appointed

held jan 20 
more than 800 international observers were on hand seeking to 
assure violencefree balloting a november 1987 election was 
thwarted after 34 voters were shot or hacked to death by thugs 
backed by the army 
the observers praised the behavior of the army and police who 
kept order and patrolled streets at a discreet distance from 
polling stations 
this time the army has been equal to its task said jean 
robert sabalat president of the electoral council we have just 
lived together a great day in our history 
about 3 million voters 85 percent of the electorate were 
registered to vote the turnout wasnt known but was thought to be 
high

a popular uprising overthrew jeanclaude duvalier in 1986 
ending the repressive dictatorship that began when papa doc

terror fostered by former members of the duvalier family militia

fourteen former government officials 
including top national security experts cautioned on monday 
against delaying military action in the persian gulf much beyond 
the jan 15 un deadline set for the withdrawal of iraqi forces 
from kuwait 
adm william j moorer former chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff said war in the persian gulf is certainly probable but 
is not totally certain 
i think the debate is primarily about when it will become 
necessary rather than whether moorer said 
the retired admiral joined robert f ellsworth a former deputy 
secretary of defense in releasing a letter that they and 12 other 
former civilian and military officials sent to iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz 
the letter urged aziz to advise iraqi president saddam hussein 
that the signers oppose demands in congress for continued reliance 
on sanctions 
such misguided views should not stand in the way of the use of 
all necessary means to enforce the deadline the signers said 
if iraq does not unconditionally withdraw from kuwait by jan 
15 they said we do not believe it wise or in the interest of 
international security to delay the use of all necessary means much 
beyond that date 
ellsworth a former republican congressman from kansas said 
that the calls for letting the sanctions work for six months for 
12 months some congressional leaders have even called for 24 
months simply play into saddam husseins hands 
saddam hussein will not respond to anything except a credible 
threat of immediate military action thats what will move him out 
of kuwait ellsworth said 
moorer told reporters i dont think we can just sit forever 
and rely totally on sanctions 
the letter expressed support of president bush and the un 
security council in requiring iraqs immediate complete and 
unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
others signing the letter were richard v allen and robert c 
mcfarlane both of whom served as national security advisers to 
former president reagan thomas c reed former secretary of the 
air force john f lehman former secretary of the navy retired 
gen px kelly former commandant of the marine corps retired 
vice adm john j shanahan former commander of the us 2nd fleet 
retired brig gen james d hittle former assistant secretary of 
the navy retired brig gen hugh s aitken former deputy director 
of joint plans for the marine corps robert h knight former 
chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york robert d 
blackwill former special assistant to the president for national 
security affairs roland a paul former counsel of the senate 
foreign relations committee and william j taylor former director

president bush today chose former tennessee 
gov lamar alexander who has been active in education reform to 
fill the post of education secretary vacated last week when lauro 
cavazos was forced to resign 
meanwhile the adminstration signaled it may be backing away from 
a controversial education department edict that racebased minority 
scholarships are illegal white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said bush was very disturbed about the ruling 
no governor in the country is so clearly identified with the 
movement to improve education bush said in presenting alexander 
he described the nominee as being at the forefront of the 
movement to restructure our nations schools 
alexander has long been a national leader in education reform 
he left the tennessee governors office in 1986 after two terms and 
has been president of the university of tennessee the past three 
years 
a republican alexander has been president of the university of 
tennessee for the past three years he was governor of tennessee 
from 197886 
while governor he pushed for education reform and instituted 
his master teacher plan that plan gave teachers higher pay 
based on education levels and performance 
on the subject of racebased scholarships fitzwater said bush 
has ordered the education department to conduct a quick review 
with advice from the justice department and white house lawyers 
bush believes these scholarships are important to minorities 
and to ensuring opportunities for all americans to get a good 
education the spokesman said 
alexander said we have scholarships for minority students who 
are poor at the university of tennessee and they have proved 
useful in helping poor students get an education 
its ultimately a constitutional question and well try to 
assure the students that under any reasonable set of circumstances 
those who now have scholarships shouldnt be in fear of those 
alexander said 
robert atwell president of the american council on education 
called the naming of alexander the most positive signal we could 
have gotten that the president really wants to be the education 
president the council is a washingtonbased lobby representing 
some 1800 institutions of higher learning 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said he was optimistic that alexander as a former 
governor could bring to the department some of the dynamism that 
critics said it lacked under cavazos 
im hopeful he said in a telephone interview i doubt 
very much hed take the position unless there was that kind of 
expectation 
bush made the alexander announcement at a morning meeting with 
reporters at which he also introduced his new labor secretary 
outgoing rep lynn martin bush announced the martin choice friday 
while she was home in illinois 
still open is the top job at the republican national committee 
vacant anew because of last weeks surprise withdrawal by william 
bennett 
cavazos was viewed by his critics within the administration as 
passive and ineffectual alexander as tennessee governor and 
president of the national governors association has been an 
aggressive advocate for education and has the television skills 
cavazos was often criticized for lacking 
alexander said his priorities will be to improve schools for the 
nations children and training and adult education opportunities 
for american workers who need new skills for the changing 
workplace 
alexander said that when tennessee was looking for workers for a 
new general motors plant families considering the move would ask 
two questions 
the second question is where can i get good schools for my 
children and the first question is where can i go back to 
school 
alexander told bush i appreciate and am grateful for the 
chance to do this 
of martin bush said working americans have a friend in lynn 
martin she understands the challenges facing our workforce 
the martin and alexander appointments are all but certain to win 
confirmation on capitol hill both will have to go before the 
senate labor and human resources committee probably in january 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the committee chairman said 
alexander has a distinguished record in education and earned 
bipartisan respect for his role in stimulating education reform in 
the states 
school reform cannot succeed without strong federal 
leadership said kennedy who added that he will use the 
confirmation hearing to explore alexanders views on the proper 
role of congress and the president 
the moves also fill the cabinet for now 
transportation secretary samuel skinner is among those being 
considered for the chairmans post at the republican national 
committee a post bush is expected to fill soon 
bush had been expected to fill the education post quickly 
because of criticism the administration received for the way 
cavazos was forced to resign cavazos the first hispanic american 
to serve in the cabinet was not on hand for the announcement he 
was leaving the cabinet as is the customary practice 
bush made no reference to cavazos as he introduced alexander 
other candidates for the education post had included hawaii rep 
pat saiki who like martin lost a senate race and lynne cheney 
chairwoman of the national endowment for the humanities and wife of 
defense secretary dick cheney

mortgage delinquencies rose sharply from july 
through september the mortgage bankers association said monday in 
a report it said was further proof the economy is in a downturn 
overall delinquency rates are essentially the same as a year 
ago executive vice president warren lasko said but following 
a dip earlier this year we now see a significant upward movement 
in all categories of delinquencies 
unfortunately in the context of higher unemployment rates and 
a decline in home price appreciation we may be looking at further 
evidence that a recession is upon us he added 
indeed the association report said it would not be surprising 
for delinquency rates to stay at the higher levels of the third 
quarter and perhaps to even drift up a bit more given the state of 
the economy particularly in the new england states 
the association survey found the delinquency rate was 50 
percent up from 452 percent in the second quarter and 441 
percent in the first the rate in the third quarter of 1989 was 
496 percent 
the survey also found that foreclosures had risen slightly the 
033 percent rate compared with a 031 percent rate in the previous 
quarter 
contributing most to the delinquency increase were mortgages 
30days past due this category which provides the least concern 
rose from 313 percent in the second quarter to 347 percent in the 
third 
but mortgages with 60day delinquencies increased from 070 
percent to 078 percent while those that were 90day late rose from 
069 percent to 075 percent 
on a regional basis delinquency rates were higher in the 
northeast and south but were lower in the midwest and west 
compared to yearago levels the report said during the same 
time period the percentage of loans in foreclosure fell in the 
midwest and west but rose in the northeast and south 
the rate of late installments in the northeastern states rose to 
448 percent in the third quarter of 1990 from 434 percent in the 
same period of last year loans under foreclosure advanced from 
070 percent in the third quarter of last year to 087 percent from 
july through september 
the delinquency rate in the south moved upfrom a yearago level 
of 553 percent to 586 percent this year foreclosures rose from 
109 percent last year to 115 percent in 1990 
in the north central region the delinquency rate fell to 500 
percent from 513 percent loans in foreclosure fell from 098 
percent to 092 percent 
delinquencies in the west dropped from a 408 percent rate in 
the third quarter of 1989 to 398 percent from july through 
september while the foreclosure rate fell from 114 percent last 
year to 074 percent 
the survey covered 155 million loans on one to fourunit 
properties about onethird of all residential mortgage loans in 
the united states

when rumors circulated in the pentagon a few 
weeks ago that defense secretary dick cheney might reduce the 
purchase order for the navys futuristic a12 stealth warplane 
few imagined that the new number might be zero 
the a12 may yet get built but its prospects dimmed greatly 
last friday when cheney told navy secretary h lawrence garrett 
that he would cancel the 50 billion project on jan 4 unless the 
navy could show cause why it should be salvaged 
the a12 program is in serious trouble cheney wrote in a 
memorandum to garrett the apparent schedule slippages cost 
growth and management deficiencies in this program are intolerable 
if we cannot spend the taxpayers money wisely we will not spend 
it 
cheneys blunt words underscore how far the a12s fortunes have 
fallen this year 
less than eight months ago cheney was telling congress that a 
highlevel pentagon review had given the a12 a clean bill of 
health and that the navy was on track to begin fielding the first 
of 620 a12s on schedule and within budget 
a few weeks later the contractors mcdonnell douglas corp and 
general dynamics corp disclosed that they were far behind 
schedule and far above budget they also raised doubts about their 
ability to build the plane to specifications 
two weeks ago an internal navy report on the a12 program 
concluded that the contractors and navy managers failed to fully 
advise top pentagon officials of cost overruns and the likelihood 
of delays in building the prototypes in response garrett sacked 
the threestar admiral in charge of navy aviation programs and he 
reprimanded two other uniformed officers involved 
the a12 episode is all the more remarkable for the national 
security interests at stake 
the navy has no known alternative to the new aircraft called 
the avenger which has been scheduled to begin replacing the a6 
intruder attack plane in the mid1990s and to serve as the main 
carrierbased bomber well into the 21st century 
cheney alluded to this in his note to garrett 
we will continue to need to develop a basic strike airplane 
for our aircraft carrier force cheney wrote because the a6 
fleet is too old too slow and lacks the technology necessary to 
maintain us naval air superiority 
the a6s some of which currently are deployed in the persian 
gulf crisis have been in service for nearly 30 years the aircraft 
was used along with air force f111 fighterbombers in the april 
1986 american bombing raid on libya 
little is known about the capabilities of the a12 avenger 
because it is highly classified 
cheney in his memo to garrett seemed to be indicating that the 
avenger must go ahead but that he wants a major shakeup in the 
projects management one possible outcome is that the 48 billion 
mcdonnell douglasgeneral dynamics contract for building avenger 
prototypes would be rewritten to give the companies more time to 
overcome the technical problems they have encountered 
that probably would mean the avenger would not enter service 
until late in this decade or possibly later 
it also is possible that the pentagon will decide to buy far 
fewer of the planes than the 620 now planned fewer may be needed 
if as seems likely the aircraft carrier fleet is reduced from the 
current 14 in response to budget pressures and the end of the cold 
war 
mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics are expected to formally 
ask the pentagon soon to restructure the avenger contract to 
account for unanticipated costs

the marxist government of ethiopia has reached 
an agreement with the united states and israel to more than double 
the number of jews it allows to emigrate officials said monday 
the ethiopian government is being rewarded with israeli aid and 
a thaw in relations with washington which have been strained for 
over a decade said the officials who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
under the agreement reached last month in the ethiopian capital 
of addis ababa president haile mengistu mariam will allow up to 
1000 jews to leave for israel every month said the officials 
a previous agreement negotiated by israel last year after it 
resumed diplomatic ties with ethiopia allowed 400500 to leave 
every month but was violated by mengistu last summer from july 
through october no jews were allowed to leave 
israeli and us officials estimate some 20000 jews are 
stranded in addis ababa after trekking there from their homes in 
northern ethiopia to escape famine and civil war and await flights 
to israel activists in israel claim some 250 of their brethren 
have died of disease and hunger while waiting 
ethiopian jews who trace their lineage to biblical times lived 
in isolation from mainstream jewish life for over 2000 years in 
1984 israel launched a secret airlift with us support to rescue 
them 
some 8000 were evacuated before operation moses became public 
causing the government of ethiopia to block further departures 
israel had been trying to resume the jewish emigration and a 
breakthrough was made when ethiopia agreed to reestablish 
diplomatic ties which it broke in 1973 in solidarity with the 
arabs 
but mengistu wanted israel to supply him with weapons against 
the eritrean rebels who have been trying to unseat him for some 30 
years us congressmen say mengistu wanted israel to sell him 
cluser bombs 
israel says it refused because the weapons are manufactured with 
us technology and the administration refused to allow such sales 
to ethiopia 
instead israel provided ethiopia with some light weapons 
mainly old rifles and agricultural and technological aid 
it also interceded with the united states to urge that 
washington improve relations with mengistu said one official 
the israeli efforts were aided by the administrations desire 
for ethiopian support for a un security council resolution 
authorizing use of force against iraq secretary of state james 
baker met with ethiopian foreign minister dinka tesfaye last month 
at the united nations to solicit his support as a member of the 
15nation security council 
two weeks earlier assistant secretary of state herman cohen 
traveled to addis ababa primarily to participate in a joint 
meeting with ethiopian and israeli officials regarding jewish 
emigration the state department said 
his trip was intended to encourage progress on this issue and 
to make clear that we will not be satisfied until all ethiopian 
jews who wish to leave ethiopia can do so said a statement 
issued by the department 
us officials said the administration had received promises 
from israel and ethiopia that emigration would not be linked with 
any arms sales to ethiopia 
the administration still wants ethiopia to improve its human 
rights record to allow international relief shipments to prevent 
famine and to negotiate in good faith with the rebels about ending 
the civil war 
rebel and government representatives were brought together under 
us auspices in washington two months ago but failed to make real 
progress

secretary of state james a baker iii 
said monday that saddam hussein may withdraw some iraqi troops from 
kuwait by jan 15 in a ploy to divide the alliance against iraq 
he urged foreign ministers of the north atlantic treaty 
organization to stand firm against any iraqi tactics and resist 
partial solutions to the persian gulf crisis 
we need to anticipate saddams possible moves be prepared for 
a partial withdrawal ploy and coordinate closely our responses 
baker said at the start of a twoday meeting of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization 
baker said he was willing to go to baghdad for talks with saddam 
on any day from dec 20 through jan 3 iraq has suggested jan 12 
for the talks just three days before the deadline set in a un 
resolution authorizing the use of force to drive iraq from kuwait 
if saddam hussein is not willing to see me on any one of 
15 dates he is telling all of us that hes interested not in 
communication but manipulation baker said 
we are willing to communicate but not to play saddams games 
and no one else should either he told his counterparts in a text 
made available to reporters 
at the end of the days talks the ministers released a 
statement reaffirming their resolve to see the iraqi invaders out 
of kuwait by jan 15 
the responsibility now lies with the government of iraq to 
ensure peace by complying fully with the mandatory united nations 
decisions said the nato statement 
it said complete iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and restoration of 
its legitimate government are unequivocal conditions for a 
peaceful solution 
there can be no partial solutions the statement said 
baker cautioned the ministers that as the midjanuary deadline 
approaches they should expect saddam to try to undercut the 
collective will of the international community to use force 
just as i believe he chose to release hostages for this 
purpose i think he may take a dramatic step on or around jan 
15 he said he could withdraw partially 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd urged saddam to dismiss 
any thoughts of dividing the coalition against his aug 2 seizure 
of kuwait 
he said the nato statement as well as one issued during the 
weekend by the 12nation european community underscored western 
unity 
all this should be mounting evidence for iraq that there is no 
point in staying in kuwait in the hope that somehow the coalition 
is about to split he said 
it is very important from the point of view of looking for 
peaceful solutions that the iraqis should not deceive themselves in 
the next few weeks he said 
we have not decided to go to war but we are running out of 
time said belgian foreign minister mark eyskens the choice 
between peace and war is in the hands of iraq 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis said the european 
community would decide tuesday whether to meet this week with 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz 
the ec had asked de michelis to meet in rome with aziz after he 
went to washington for talks with president bush but azizs 
meeting with bush scheduled for monday was canceled 
baker called on the allies to shoulder more of the costs of the 
gulf operation in light of increased us troop deployments by 
midjanuary the united states will have more than 400000 troops 
in the gulf region 
it means significant new economic burdens for us he said 
and it means real risks and real sacrifices by the american 
people 
among nato nations only france and britain have sent 
substantial military forces to the gulf region other nations have 
provided ships and planes to ferry soldiers and equipment and 
still others have contributed money

similar attention should be focused on hostages in lebanon 
last week mrs say said she planned to go to lebanon in january 
in an effort to find her brother

lena olin was a tomboy she didnt want to be 
pretty she cut her hair short and refused to wear dresses she 
preferred sports to dolls and fighting to tea parties 
she changed once she turned 13 no one whos seen the 
unbearable lightness of being and enemies a love story would 
question that but watch those films the way she uncorks a wine 
bottle with her teeth or the erotic tension between olin and other 
women and youll see a masculine spirit that runs much deeper than 
a bowler hat 
and she hasnt stopped looking for new ways to bring that 
quality into her professional life as a swedish actress shes 
been compared to garbo but when olin speaks of tackling classic 
roles its not only camille thats on her mind 
one of my first stage parts was in a comedy called able 
drugger an english comedy olin dressed in jeans and a simple 
white blouse recalled in a recent interview i played a man and 
i enjoyed that i very much would like to play a man id like to 
do hamlet 
hamlet is a tragic male incapable of making up his mind but 
olin might be too tough as the danish prince her characters 
sabina in the unbearable lightness of being and masha in 
enemies a love story are erotic cynics intelligent 
complex highly sexual painfully selfaware 
theres something otherwordly about them theyre objects of 
desire yet very much alone they make their own rules fair play no 
longer matters theyve been hurt too often 
sabina is an avantgarde artist living in czechoslovakia during 
the 1968 uprising a free spirit in an oppressed country the 
mistress of a seductive doctor who can make tugging a curtain seem 
pornographic masha for which olin received an academy award 
nomination for best supporting actress is an embittered holocaust 
survivor a force of life but an even stronger force of death 
in havana her new film olin plays roberta duran a swede 
trapped in a casablancalike love triangle torn between 
american playboygambler robert redford and cuban revolutionary 
raul julia roberta or bobbi as shes called is somewhat softer 
than masha or sabina shes more passive easier to manipulate and 
for olin an easier person to like 
sabinas so bored with life so fed up with life olin said 
and mashas so distraught she was hard to live with i like to 
be able to close the door to the studio but its very difficult 
with some characters i also felt very vulnerable when i did bobbi 
i wanted to be good when i did bobbi and i kept that with me 
masha was very hard to come back to every night to sleep with 
every night you touch areas in yourself that i dont think are 
very healthy to touch 
olin 35 was born in stockholm her parents were actors her 
father stij olin appearing in ingmar bergmans classic the 
seventh seal but they divorced when she was little and for all 
her all spirit she remembered herself as selfconscious and 
insecure more at home with inner thoughts than with the outside 
world 
i was a weird child and i still see things differently she 
recalled in a soft voice smiling shyly i always remember very 
strange things i have a capacity to walk in an apartment where 
there are boxes and papers and someone will say excuse the boxes 
and papers and ill say oh i didnt see that i think i 
concentrate on other things small things that can be revealing 
acting was the perfect way to express herself and at age 20 
olin entered the royal dramatic theater school joining bergmans 
famed company of players on stage she starred in the plays of 
shakespeare strindberg and chekhov and she also worked with 
bergman on films appearing in after the rehearsal and fanny 
and alexander 
olin sees nothing peculiar or silly about her tomboy roots it 
was a phase to build upon rather than outgrow a yearning to be in 
touch with all sides of herself a rebellion against the rules that 
men and women are supposed to obey that went beyond mere 
roleplaying 
if i ever had a daughter id bring her up the same way 
encourage her to do what i did said olin a single mother whose 
son august is named after strindberg 
i think its important for everyone to stay open not to be 
afraid and if you push that way i think that makes a difference 
for an actor the great thing about marlon brando hes very macho 
and all of that but theres a huge woman in there as well

the justice department said monday it is 
investigating 100 schemes to evade gasoline taxes and officials 
fear the new nickelagallon hike in the federal levy will spawn 
more fraud 
with the fivecent increase in the gasoline excise tax we 
have no doubt there will be an incentive to cheat said shirley 
d peterson the assistant attorney general who heads the justice 
departments tax division 
after the tax hike took effect dec 1 an informant told a 
government prosecutor that the word on the street is thanks for 
the early christmas present she told reporters 
the schemes which cost the federal government at least 1 
billion in lost revenue were initially detected in the mid1980s 
as a way for organized crime to muscle into a legitimate business 
officials said 
but legitimate businesses are increasingly involved in the 
schemes particularly businesses under the pressure of price 
competition in an industry with thin profit margins officials 
said 
there have been 25 convictions since 1987 peterson said 
but the nov 16 guilty verdict against getty terminals corp a 
getty executive and two independent gasoline wholesalers for 
scheming to evade 1 million in excise taxes was one of the first 
convictions of a legitimate business she said the company could 
be fined 2 million and individual defendants could be sentenced to 
20 years in prison 
if you consider the number of gallons of gasoline sold you 
begin to understand the magnitude of the potential problem and the 
temptation to cheat she said theres just enormous enormous 
money to be made by those who are able to find ways to basically 
defeat the payment of the tax 
with low profit margins legitimate dealers are driven out of 
business unless they get on board the criminal activity 
besides trying to recover lost tax revenue we want to make it 
possible for the legitimate businessman to carry on his business 
without getting creamed by criminal activity she said 
the 100 investigations of gasoline taxevasion schemes are being 
conducted in 18 cities around the country peterson said most have 
reached the stage of prosecutors submitting evidence to federal 
grand juries 
in addition to the new york city area the problem is most 
evident in florida texas the midwest and california officials 
said 
the sale of gasoline stocks at terminals from one registered 
wholesaler to another is exempt from excise taxes 
but businesses use phony corporations fake invoices and other 
schemes that test the perseverance of prosecutors and agents to 
go through the mountains and mountains of documents said james 
a bruton one of petersons deputies 
four of the five major organized crime families in the new york 
city area the gambino lucchese colombo and genovese mobs are 
involved in gasoline tax schemes along with groups formed by 
russian emigres said prosecutor james rodio 
anybody involved in the scheme has to pay what is known as the 
mob tax a penny to two cents a gallon rodio said 
earlier this year a colombo family capo pleaded guilty to 
extorting money from a long island wholesaler he said 
bruton said prosecutors are trying to determine the involvement 
of legitimate businesses in most of the transactions under 
investigation 
they have the cash normally to start with and the transactions 
downstream usually result from them having the cash bruton said 
i think its an issue of the degree of their participation and the 
degree of their knowledge of whats going on

lynn martin said monday she expects a very 
productie relationship with organized labor if shes confirmed 
as secretary of labor

white house because we share the same goals martin said when

the federal reserve caught between 
persistently bad inflation figures and a slumping economy is 
likely to opt for a slight easing of credit conditions in coming 
weeks private economists said monday on the eve of a key meeting 
of fed policymakers 
the bush administration has been pressuring the fed to ease 
interest rates aggressively in an effort to lessen the severity of 
the recession that many economists think began in october 
however the downturn is occurring at a time when inflation has 
remained at disturbing levels in large part because the persian 
gulf crisis has sent energy prices soaring 
for this reason many economists believe that fed policymakers 
will adopt a goslow approach when they meet behind closed doors on 
tuesday to map monetary strategy 
normally in this kind of downturn the fed would be easing 
aggressively but inflation off the middle east events is still 
substantial said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
many economists were looking for fed policymakers meeting as 
the federal open market committee to engineer another small 
decrease in the federal funds rate the interest that banks charge 
each other for overnight loans private economists predicted 
monday 
in the past seven weeks the fed has pushed the funds rate down 
a quarter point three times from 8 percent to 725 percent 
many analysts said they believed the fed would wait until the 
december unemployment report is released on jan 4 before reducing 
the rate again 
that would give the central bank time to assess other economic 
data and also to gauge whether inflation is moderating a key 
statistic on that front will be released right before tuesdays 
meeting when the labor department reports on consumer inflation for 
the month of november 
last friday the government said that wholesale prices during 
november rose 05 percent about twice what analysts had been 
expecting but many economists believe the report on consumer 
prices will show them rising a more moderate 03 percent in 
december 
some economists believe that if inflation does show signs of 
moderating the fed will move to cut the discount rate the most 
dramatic signal it can send of its desire to push interest rates 
lower in order to rescue a slumping economy the discount rate 
which has stood at 7 percent since february 1989 is the interest 
the fed charges to loan money to banks 
but there is dispute on this point with other economists 
contending that the fed will not touch the discount rate anytime 
soon for fear of sending the wrong signal to financial markets 
about the feds inflationfighting resolve 
overhanging all of the feds deliberations is the threat of war 
in the middle east 
if a shooting war does erupt after the jan 15 deadline for iraq 
to withdraw from kuwait that would likely have the effect of 
driving oil prices up sharply thus making the feds 
inflationfighting task even harder 
a war would be a very unfavorable environment for the fed to 
be trying to ease domestic interest rates said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer the fed will have to worry about a possible war and also 
the effect any further easing would have on other central banks 
jones said if german and japanese officials hold their interest 
rates firm at the same time that us rates are being cut that 
could weaken the dollar as foreign investors dumped the greenback 
in favor of foreigndenominated investments offering a higher rate 
of return 
even if tuesdays meeting produces nothing more than a small 
025 percentage cut in the federal funds rate many economists said 
that would be enough to finally push banks to cut their prime 
lending rate to 95 percent down from the 10 percent where it has 
been stuck since last january 
david wyss chief financial economist of drimcgraw hill said 
that in addition to a halfpercentage point cut in banks prime 
lending rate he was looking for mortgage rates to continue 
falling 
last week 30year fixedrate mortgages fell to 951 percent 
the lowest level in three years according to survey by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp 
wyss said mortgage rates will probably decline to around 925 
percent early next year

nasa which had trouble this year in the 
hightech world of space is downright deficient in the lowtech 
world of keeping its buildings in good repair a governmental 
report said monday 
the space shuttles garage leaks high voltage transformers are 
corroded one cooling tower collapsed from an accumulation of ice 
and faulty wiring caused a fire in a control room all because of 
poor maintenance the congressional general accounting office said 
nasa has given little priority to preserving its facilities 
most of which are at least 30 years old and there is no standard 
maintenance system within nasa the study said 
many of nasas facilities have not been adequately maintained 
and are in degraded conditions it continued in addition 
several serious incidents have been caused by the facilities 
deterioration including a fire and a steam line explosion 
the associated press in a report three months ago called 
nasas crumbling facilities a handymans nightmare the story 
cited the leaky roof on the 52story vehicle assembly building at 
the kennedy space center the second largest building in the world 
in terms of volume rain has splashed down on computers in the 
modernistic adjoining launch control center 
ventilation systems and heating boilers are so old that parts no 
longer are available and nasa must make its own obsolete circuit 
breakers at kennedy and at the ames research center in mountain 
view calif pose so much danger that power must be turned off 
before workers can test them 
people and facilities are critical to mission success said 
sen barbara mikulski dmd chairwoman of the subcommittee that 
oversees the space agency we cant afford breakdowns on the 
ground if were going to have spectaculars in space 
john e obrien assistant deputy administrator of nasa called 
the report a useful assessment and constructive and 
appropriate adding that the agency is in the process of 
correcting the problems 
gao said nasa leaves maintenance of the 15 billion worth of 
facilities to directors of its nine centers six auxiliary 
installations and three deepspace network sites these directors 
the report said give maintenance different priorities 
things are so bad the report said that at the marshall space 
flight center in alabama the roof of a laboratory building leaked 
so badly that electricians working with 440volt equipment had to 
be moved out because of a severe shock hazard 
at the same center fire in a mission control building was 
caused by loose electrical connections the collapse of the cooling 
tower at the lewis research center in ohio was caused partially by 
the weight of ice that accumulated due to malfunctioning water 
valves 
the report has pictures showing the deterioration a high 
voltage distribution transformer at ames showing corrosion and oil 
leaks a wall damaged by leaking water in a stairwell at goddard 
space flight center in maryland peeling paint and surface 
corrosion on a building at marshall 
among the serious problems cited in the report are leaks in the 
vehicle assembly building at kennedy where the space shuttle is 
mated with its external fuel tank and rocket boosters 
because of leaks going back several years rust expansion of 
reinforcing bars caused pieces of concrete up to 8 inches across to 
break loose and fall 
to prevent damage to the shuttle or injuries to the workers 
below nasa erected nets between the structural steel trusses to 
catch any falling concrete the report said 
overall the conditions of nasas nine centers were ranked near 
or below marginal by the gaos investigators the problems 
generally were leaking roofs deteriorating roads peeling paint 
and corrosion leaking pump seals and groundwater seepage into 
basement utility rooms 
the gao recommended that standards be established to guide 
centers in putting together maintenance plans that the agencys 
budget include funds equal to 2 percent to 4 percent of replacement 
value for keeping up the facilities and that annual surveys be 
conducted

in the celebration alongside betteroff aristide supporters some 
celebrants rode in mercedes benz cars shiny nissans and jeeps 
carrying posters of aristide and waving green tree branches 
people leaned out of their vehicles shouting aristide is our 
president now we are saved 
in front of the whitedomed national palace hundreds on foot 
shouted the priests name under the watchful eyes of soldiers 
clutching automatic weapons 
truckloads of police dressed in riot gear were on hand to 
prevent any violence 
the woman was shot and killed at midday when police fired into a 
crowd celebrating outside st jean bosco roman catholic church in a 
portauprince slum where aristide once preached in september 
1988 assassins attacked during mass killing 12 people wounding 
70 and burning the building 
witnesses said that on monday that about a halfdozen policemen 
wearing gas masks pulled up in a blue police pickup and opened fire 
on hundreds of aristide supporters singing and dancing outside the 
church 
lannis waters a photographer said he saw the policemen in the 
truck and heard gunfire but could not tell how many shots were 
fired into the crowd or why he said the crowd ran in panic 
from a photograph the dead woman appeared about seven months 
pregnant 
there were fears that the celebrations could turn ugly with 
people seeking revenge against supporters of the duvalier 
dictatorship that ruled this caribbean nation for 29 years 
when jeanclaude duvalier son of francois papa doc 
duvalier was deposed in february 1986 following a mass uprising a 
celebration quickly turned into a rampage people burned and 
pillaged homes of known duvalier supporters in what in haiti is 
called a dechoukaj or uprooting 
people are very excited said jeanclaude roy a businessman 
and political leader this can turn into a very bloody thing 
he said it was important for aristide to have the good sense 
to appeal to haitians not to resort to violence 
outside the headquarters of roger lafontant head of the tonton 
macoute militia that enforced the duvalier rule dozens of 
supporters shooed away motorists who slowed near the gates 
lafontant returned from exile earlier this year to run for 
president but was barred by the electoral council 
lafontant promised in an interview last week to do anything 
to prevent aristide from becoming president saying haiti would 
never be delivered to communism 
the scene was calm and somber in the wealthier suburb of 
petionville where presidential candidate marc bazin a former 
world bank economist lives and has considerable support 
one woman selling rice from a burlap sack said aristide is 
not the man here

iraqi president saddam hussein has broadbased 
support within his country with the army a mainstay of his regime 
according to a us military study written shortly before the 
persian gulf crisis erupted 
today in iraq we have a regime that views its rule as 
legitimate and an army that is confident and supportive of the 
regimes policy on top of which all opposition inside iraq has 
collapsed according to the us army war college report 
contrary to general belief iraqs rulers enjoy significant 
popular support the report said there is virtually no sign 
that the iraqi army is estranged from the regime if anything it 
appears to be its mainstay 
despite praise for the iraqi militarys professionalism the 
report doubts saddams contention that his country could be 
selfsufficient in weapons within a decade 
the authors do not believe that iraq has the cash to 
develop a major arms industry concludes the study titled 
iraqi power and us security in the middle east 
the most it can do is lay the groundwork for such an 
institution which it can then build on when it gets back on its 
feet substantially 
the study which examines iraqs victory over iran in the 
eightyear war that ended in july 1988 was written by three 
analysts before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 it was declassified 
over the summer 
the authors who did not visit iraq but examined source 
materials said they based their conclusion of the militarys 
suport for saddam on his ability to order a general callup 
during what was perhaps the darkest period of war 
they also said the populations willingness to comply with the 
regimes order confirmed its legitimacy 
the study raises questions about whether saddam used chemical 
weapons against the kurdish minority in iraq in the fall of 1988 
after the iraniraq war ended 
having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us 
we find it impossible to confirm the state departments claim that 
gas was used in this instance the authors said 
to begin with there were never any victims produced 
international relief organizations who examined the kurds 
failed to discover any the report said it said the claims 
rested solely on the testimony of the kurds who have long sought 
autonomy from iraq 
conclusive evidence on the attack was never produced the 
study said 
col doug johnson one of the studys authors said the authors 
did not visit iraq or interview kurds to reach their 
interpretation instead they looked at published reports and at 
pictures he said in a telephone interview 
they concluded that the kurds had symptoms such as temporary 
blindness and skin blisters that are more commonly associated with 
attack by fuel air explosives rather than chemical weapons 
on sept 8 1988 the state department accused iraq of using 
chemical weapons against the kurds and thensecretary of state 
george shultz lodged a protest with iraq 
at the time the state department did not say what evidence it 
had that iraq had used chemical weapons against the kurds or where 
the evidence had come from 
amnesty international the international human rights group 
accused iraq of killing hundreds of kurds with chemical weapons 
the group said it based its report on accounts from kurdish 
refugees 
us officials have repeatedly cited baghdads possession of 
chemical weapons as a reason for taming saddam even if he were to 
leave kuwait 
imagine his saddams ability to blackmail his neighbors 
should he possess a nuclear device president bush said at a news 
conference earlier this month weve seen him use chemical 
weapons on his own people 
several accounts reported iraqs alleged use of chemical weapons 
in the late summer of 1988 iraq denied the charge 
during the iraniraq war both sides used chemical weapons 
according to leif rosenberger another one of the authors 
but iraqs chemical superiority was overstated we thought 
rosenberger said iraq used chemical weapons as a defensive measure 
against iranian human wave attacks the study said 
claims that they iraq won simply by using massive amounts of 
chemical weapons cannot be substantiated 
the war college study also deals with an incident in which kurds 
were killed by chemical gas in march 1988 in the city of halabjah 
iraq was blamed for the halabjah attack even though it was 
subsequently brought out that iran too had used chemicals in this 
operation and it seemed likely that it was the iranian bombardment 
that had actually killed the kurds the report said 
johnson said pictures from halabjah showed victims with blue 
mouths and hands indications that a cyanidebased gas had been 
used the iranians not the iraqis are known to possess such 
gases that affect the blood he said 
the authors of the war college study said their conclusions were 
their own and did not necessarily represent the views of the 
college or the army

britains armed 
forces minister said monday that war in the persian gulf is more 
likely than ever because iraq appears adamant about remaining in 
kuwait 
archie hamilton deputy to defense minister tom king said the 
united states and its allies would find it too difficult to sustain 
an army in the region for another year to give economic sanctions a 
chance to work 
hamilton said he hoped americans would support president bush in 
choosing to fight if iraq keeps its forces in kuwait after the jan 
15 deadline set by the un security council 
saddam is now back to saying hes not going to withdraw and in 
those circumstances it looks as if war is more likely than it was 
say a week ago he said during a visit to java battery of the 
40th field regiment royal artillery 
it is part of the 9000man 7th desert rats armored brigade 
which is attached to the us marine force in norteastern saudi 
arabia 
we have to be optimistic that this man will eventually see 
sense and realize hes got to leave kuwait hell either do it 
bloodily or hell go peacefully he should choose the peaceful 
option hamilton said 
saddam has to know that the troops in the usled multinational 
force are getting more and more prepared and were in a position 
where we cant just do nothing as the deadline passes he said 
if he doesnt withdraw at that stage then the risk of war 
starts to rise very highly hamilton said 
the united states is expected to have about 450000 troops in 
the region by the un deadline and the british more than 30000 
the thirdlargest contingent in the allied forces of 190000 after 
the saudi army 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and now has an estimated 500000 
troops in kuwait and southern iraq

president kenneth kaunda approved new laws 
monday legalizing opposition political parties ending 17 years of 
oneparty rule 
at a brief ceremony kaunda signed constitutional amendments 
allowing for a return to multiparty democracy they had been 
approved unamimously by the 125seat parliament on nov 30 and 
needed kaundas signature to become law 
im doing this very happily indeed because i believe it is the 
wish of the people to go multiparty again he told officials 
gathered on the lawn of his official residence 
he said multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections 
would be held before september 1991 
after the signing ceremony leading government opponents said 
they will announce formation of a political organization to contest 
the balloting 
since kaunda declared a oneparty state in 1973 his united 
national independence party has been the only legal political 
organization 
in a statement in lusaka a spokesman for the movement for 
multiparty democracy said the group would register as a political 
party after a meeting of its officials tuesday the party will 
retain the name chosen when it was created by prodemocracy 
activists as a pressure group earlier this year 
we intend to exercise maximum restraint throughout the 
transition period to democracy because we believe in peaceful and 
constutional means said party chairman arthur wina 
at mondays ceremony kaunda told colleagues i compel myself 
to believe that after 26 years we consider ourselves mature enough 
to shoulder the responsibility of running a multiparty democracy 
kaunda who led the former british colony of northern rhodesia 
to independence as zambia in 1964 has been under mounting pressure 
in recent months from prodemocracy activists demanding political 
reforms 
labor leaders academics student organizers and influential 
businessmen including onetime kaunda loyalists led the campaign 
against the ruling partys monopoly on power 
the movement was founded in july after 27 people died in police 
and army gunfire in rioting touched off by increases in food 
prices 
zambia is one of africas poorest nations 
it is the latest of several african nations to reintroduce 
pluralism

the chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said monday that banks must soon pump billions of dollars 
more into the fastdwindling government fund guaranteeing 
customers deposits 
a coherent plan should be in place before money is actually 
needed in other words action should be taken early next year 
fdic chairman l william seidman said 
the bush administration working with the fdic will propose a 
plan to rescue the fund early next month he told the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions 
theres no need for panic he said but that doesnt mean 
there isnt any urgency 
figures included in his testimony indicate he believes banks 
should be required to pay a onetime assessment totaling 24 
billion to 25 billion 
also under the figures he presented annual deposit insurance 
premiums would be raised for the third time in as many years to 23 
cents for every 100 in deposits nearly triple the 83 cents 
charged last year the higher premium would bring in an estimated 
6 billion a year 
such a burden would add only marginally to bank failures 
seidman said he was disputed however by three private economists 
r dan brumbaugh of san francisco robert litan of the brookings 
institution and james barth of auburn university who presented a 
report to the panel 
brumbaugh said a one percent assessment on deposits would cost 
banks the equivalent of two years of earnings litan said it would 
cause additional failures costing 3 billion to 8 billion 
litan and barth believe the treasury should lend the fdic up to 
50 billion which would be repaid by banks later if possible 
brumbaugh favors using taxpayer funds without repayment to 
quickly close down failed banks 
that kind of tax on any industry is going to cause problems 
many firms will fail brumbaugh said its basically unfair 
seidman however said the banking industry has enough money to 
shore up the fund unless a disaster occurs 
as in any insurance fund the strong have to pay for the 
weak he said 
only in the event of a severe and long recession would the fdic 
have to resort to borrowing from the treasury to stay solvent he 
said 
the fdic chairman said he was still undecided about exactly how 
the assessment should be levied against bank deposits he has 
indicated the administration and his agency are examining a number 
of proposals that would allow banks for bookkeeping purposes to 
spread the expense over time critics however have raised 
concerns that this could amount to accounting gimmickry 
richard a kirk president of the american bankers association 
said the industrys largest trade group was working with the 
administration to come up with a plan for banks to recapitalize the 
fund 
the system has problems but its gloom not doom kirk 
said everyone can guess about what might happen under various 
scenarios but no one can predict with certainty 
seidmans remarks followed the presentation of brumbaugh litan 
and barths report they estimated a mild recession would produce 
bank failures costing the government 31 billion to 43 billion and 
would bankrupt the fund unless it gets more money a severe 
recession would produce failures costing as much as 63 billion 
they said 
seidman said the report was credible and in fact said its 
estimates in this worstcase scenario of a major deep recession 
are too low 
he estimated that 170 banks would fail this year reducing the 
fdic fund from 132 billion at the end of last year to around 9 
billion at the end of this year an additional 180 institutions 
likely will fail in 1991 reducing the fund to only 4 billion to 
protect 2 trillion in deposits he said 
seidman also raised the possibility that regulators may hold off 
shutting down weak banks that appear likely to recover citing the 
success of such a policy toward struggling farm banks in the 
mid1980s 
the fdics experiences have shown that forced liquidation 
of large amounts of assets in weak markets is expensive he said 
thus carefully supervised management of weak but viable 
institutions is another option 
however the economists and members of the subcommittee 
criticized that forbearance approach as extremely risky in the 
case of savings and loans it allowed institutions owners to 
gamble with deposits without risking their own money they said 
the economists report makes it abundantly clear forbearance 
doesnt work that is a pathway to hell said rep charles 
schumer dny 
several panel members suggested that deposit insurance should be 
curbed and others said regulators should stop banks from paying 
dividends to stockholders 
the subcommittee chairman rep frank annunzio dill who 
commissioned the economists report criticized seidman for failing 
to acknowledge the seriousness of the insurance funds problems 
earlier seidman began 1990 by predicting the fund would break 
even 
fdic officials may actually have contributed to the problems 
facing the fdic today by their inability to admit that the fund was 
in serious trouble annunzio said

you can drink dance or listen to a disc 
jockey at the basix nightclub but if you want to light a cigarette 
youve got to go outside 
its an enlightenment for customers who suddenly realize they 
dont have to put up with cigarette smoke there is an 
alternative said bar owner bill watkins who opened the 
nightclub oct 31 in a partnership with pittsburgh steelers 
football player chuck lanza 
when you walk through the door just take a breath and you can 
smell the difference said watkins who has asthma 
outside a billboard reads try smokefree air for a change 
draft beer 1 
the owners say theyve had no major problem because of the 
policy 
every once in a while you get somebody in here who isnt aware 
of the policy and theyll light a cigarette and everyone will 
turn and look at them its just like they totally ostracize them 
you dont have to say a word watkins said when theyre told 
its smokefree they put it out very graciously and thats the 
end of it 
at least one other bar in the country the jazz showcase in 
chicagos blackstone hotel also bans smoking 
on fridays and saturdays the south bend club has about 500 
customers each paying a 3 cover charge the owners say 
watkins admits there was much skepticism that the bar would 
succeed 
no one believed it literally we were fought from day one 
he said 
but watkins cites studies from the american tobacco industry 
saying only 22 percent of the american public smokes 
i think this country is ready for a smokeless kind of living

the owners of the five vessels involved in a 
700000gallon oil spill in galveston bay have agreed to pay for a 
study of the impact on the areas rich fishing grounds and 
sensitive marshes 
the barge and vessel owners agreed last week to pay the 
government more than 156000 to assess damages the oil may have 
caused according to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the funds will be used by noaa the interior department and the 
texas water commission to study the effects of julys spill on 
wildlife and wetlands said brian gorman a spokesman for noaa 
the study will focus in part on determining what toxic effects 
the oil may have had on young shrimp researchers will also develop 
a plan to restore damaged marshes and conduct tests to identify the 
spilled oil through a chemical fingerprinting process 
gorman said the study would give the government an assessment of 
how much it would cost to restore the area 
the heavy fuel oil was spilled july 28 when the greek tanker 
shinoussa collided with two of three barges under tow by the chandy 
n in the houston ship channel 
the barges owned by apex towing co of st louis spilled

became the first city restaurant to comply with an ordinance 
ordering all hotels motels restaurants and bars to install condom 
vending machines 
john cliffords establishment in central square between harvard 
and the massachusetts institute of technology was a year early in 
complying with the ordinance 
weve had customers come in looking for them said owner 
john clifford explaining why he installed the condom machines 
we are not going to be condom cops but we are encouraging 
people to take the law seriously and put in machines said 
jennifer wolfrum community health coordinator for the city which 
made made a law out of a recommendation to cities by the state 
department of public health

city of about 100000 people had 103 documented aids cases 
wolfrum said she said from 1000 to 3000 cambridge residents are 
infected with the hiv virus which causes aids 
city officials and aids activists said the program may be the 
only one of its kind in the nation jersey city nj tried to 
pass a similar ordinance a few years ago but the measure was 
tabled after it met with strong opposition 
the city council adopted the ordinance on nov 5 after several 
hours of debate and public hearings on the issue the program was 
brought before the council by the cambridge aids task force which 
began two years ago to address the citys growing problem with the 
deadly disease 
it was not a unanimous vote but in the long run we did the 
right thing said city councilor john myers 
all public places have until dec 31 1991 to comply with the 
ordinance 
the cambridge aids task force is printing stickers to be placed 
on the machines that will warn users about aids and provide 
telephone numbers for those seeking counseling and information the 
warnings will be in english haitian creole spanish and 
portuguese said wolfrum 
citing issues of religious and moral values raised during public 
hearings the city is allowing a way out for those at odds with the 
measure business owners seeking exemption must file a written 
request for immunity from the ordinance but no explanation is 
necessary wolfrum said

barbie the doll usually more occupied with 
clothing and hairstyle decisions didnt mean to upset anyone but 
now she stands accused by a northwest logging group of promoting 
the radical agenda of environmentalists 
at issue was a mattel toys commercial in which barbie asked her 
young admirers how to make the world a better place one 
possibility she suggested was that we could keep the trees from 
falling keep the eagles soaring 
that drew the ire of the oregon lands coalition which charged 
that mattel and barbie had pandered to a movement out to shut down 
the engines of this country and had exposed children to the 
preservationists radical agenda 
the logging group which lobbied congress last year against 
legislation aimed at protecting the northern spotted owl also has 
protested in letterwriting and telephone campaigns the 
proenvironment products and activities of several other companies 
they include kmart canon copiers american greeting cards cotler 
manufacturing ralston purina and shearson lehman hutton 
weve been known to activate 3000 to 5000 phone calls to 
manufacturers and retailers said jackie lang spokeswoman for the 
logging group she said the coalition is part of a timber and 
mining political action network that boasts 61000 members 
the group also has protested kmarts sale of save the trees 
shirts and helped persuade cotler to discontinue a childrens 
clothing line which carried tags that read environmental 
protection department absolutely no hunting of wild and free 
animals while wearing this garment 
the oregon land coalition also has assailed companies for 
donating a portion of proceeds to environmental groups 
american greeting cards for example contributes a percentage 
of sales of its wildlife line of cards to the national wildlife 
federation shearson markets an ecological trust which invests in 
environmentally conscious companies and the broker returns some 
proceeds to the environmental federation of america canon is 
donating money to the wildlife federation and the nature 
conservancy for every used copier cartridge consumers mail back to 
the company and ralston is supporting global releaf a 
reforestation project as part of a new cereal campaign 
we want to wake up corporate america to the fact that 
powerful monied groups are at work shutting down the engines of 
this country and they are doing it in the name of 
environmentalism lang said 
we need to ask the question who is really in the mainstream 
here said stephanie sklar of the national wildlife federation 
i would really hate to see these groups bully other companies who 
are making an effort to do something positive about the 
environment she said 
in the barbie commercial mattel invited children to send their 
ideas for making the world better to the company the eight 
american youngsters who sent the best replies won trips to new york 
city for a barbie summit with 39 other children from around the 
world the company promised to donate about 500000 to the cause 
picked by the young summiteers 
the oregon lands coalition feared the money would go to an 
environmental group and told its members in a newsletter buy a 
barbie and your money will help stop timber harvesting 
as it turned out while the environment and animal rights were 
the top concerns of the us children world peace was the majority 
concern of the international group mattel says it has not decided 
which peace organization will get the money 
as for the oregon land coalitions criticism mattel spokeswoman 
donna gibbs said we kind of thought how can anybody criticize a 
program that is designed to give children a voice in a world they 
are going to inherit 
cotler said it received an equal number of telephone calls 
supporting and denouncing its environmental protection line of 
childrens clothes the complaints included those of the oregon 
lands coalition and save our sawmills of white city ore 
the purpose of the theme was to promote an environmental 
awareness with young people obviously we did not have the intent 
to offend any one groups sensibilities said cotler spokeswoman 
martha koletar 
while cotler withdrew the line officials for most of the other 
companies said they stand behind their efforts 
we feel there is a corporate commitment in trying to keep the 
environment clean and good for future generations said jody 
roberts spokesperson for american greeting cards in cleveland 
ohio

a canadian businessman who sold us combat 
jets abandoned in vietnam to undercover us customs agents was 
convicted monday of filing false documents and illegally importing 
firearms 
cenon rey avelino was convicted of two counts each of filing 
false statements and of weapons violations but he was found 
innocent of five other charges including one of trading with the 
enemy 
a us district court jury partly accepted avelinos defense 
that he was entrapped by customs agents who pressured him to come 
to the united states to complete the 306000 deal for two a37 
dragonfly light attack planes 
the jury deliberated 21 hours over four days 
avelino was impassive in the courtroom but lashed out at the 
government on his way out of court 
if they did not manufacture a crime there would be no case 
he said 
juror joe franklin said that while the jurors felt avelino was 
not an innocent participant in the deal they also thought the 
government agents had come on too strong 
prosecutor roger williams said under federal sentencing 
guidelines avelino would probably face between 12 and 20 months in 
prison defense lawyer james harrington said avelino probably wont 
face any additional prison time because he spent more than a year 
in jail awaiting trial 
arguments on a newtrial motion were scheduled for feb 19 with 
sentencing to follow probably in march avelino will remain free 
on 250000 bail until then 
avelino 40 of suburban toronto was arrested in buffalo on 
nov 6 1989 
federal authorities said he sold two cessna a37 dragonfly light 
attack planes to undercover us customs agents for 306000 the 
jets were equipped with 762mm machine guns the basis of the 
weapons charges 
the pentagon has estimated that nearly 1000 planes 940 naval 
ships and boats 42000 trucks and 791000 m16 rifles were 
abandoned in vietnam when the us military pulled out in 1975 
avelino purchased the planes from the vietnamese government and 
had them disassembled and shipped to toronto 
the crated planes were seized at the international peace bridge 
coming in from canada on the day he was arrested 
the chief prosecution witness roy stafford was a jacksonville 
fla aircraft dealer who once owned the plane in which eugene 
hasenfus was shot down over nicaragua exposing the secret cia 
assistance to the contra rebels 
stafford working with customs agents led avelino to believe he 
could sell the planes to the el salvadorean air force one of the 
agents played an iranian businessman who was supposedly the 
financier of the deal 
avelino himself was once the personal pilot for the family of 
ferdinand marcos the deposed president of the philippines he also 
was a military attache at the philippine embassy in paris 
he said he got into the aircraft parts business in 1985 and 
began dealing with vietnam last year after an old friend whose 
father had become vietnams defense minister arranged for him to 
meet officials in that country who were trying to dispose of the 
abandoned us military hardware 
avelino a filipino native who became a canadian citizen in 
1977 said he was not acting illegally because canada has no law 
forbidding its citizens from trading with vietnam 
he contended he was entrapped by us agents who pressured him 
to travel to jacksonville fla and buffalo to complete the deal 
on us soil citing surveillance tapes in which he repeatedly 
asked the agents if the deal could be done in canada 
but williams introduced a thick sheaf of documents showing 
avelino went out of his way to hide the origin and value of the 
jets he portrayed avelino as a wheelerdealer who was willing to 
risk breaking the law in pursuit of deals that ultimately could 
have brought him millions of dollars 
in addition to the a37s avelino was willing to deal in uh1 
huey helicopters rifles antiaircraft guns and bombs prosecution 
witnesses contended

school district lawyers go to court 
tuesday in an effort to throw out a lawsuit filed on behalf of an 
8yearold boy whos been banished to a private classroom because 
he refuses to cut his ponytail 
for more than 2 months zachariah toungate has been kept apart 
from his third grade classmates at school because his 7inch 
ponytail violates the dress code 
zach has received cards and letters from supporters across the 
country radio station koa in denver heard in 38 states has 
encouraged listeners to write the school in a free zach 
campaign 
a firstgrade class in albany ny wrote zach a letter 
saying we feel you should have your hair anyway you want it 
its not fair that you should be locked in a room by yourself 
zachs parents filed a lawsuit claiming the schools hair policy 
discriminates because it doesnt apply to females 
a state district court judge denied a temporary injunction that 
would have allowed zach back into class the court scheduled a 
hearing for tuesday at which the school district attorneys will 
seek to have the case dismissed 
in the meantime the standoff continues 
every school day zach gets off the bus and says goodbye to his 
friends before entering an 11by13foot room dubbed an 
alternative education setting by school officials 
he eats by himself plays by himself and for 35 a day is 
provided a substitute teacher he has no physical education or 
music classes 
school officials say zachs grades havent suffered because he 
is receiving individual instruction and is not distracted easily 
but the isolation is wearing on him his mother said 
hes still in the room its getting real hard on him now 
said his mother september toungate hes real frustrated but he 
says i want to keep my tail 
two weeks ago about 15 students from the university of texas at 
austin protested in front of the elementary school and submitted a 
petition with about 1000 signatures in support of zach 
but school superintendent paul flemming said friday that zach 
will be separated from his classmates indefinitely 
the question is not hair the question is are you going to 
allow a student to willfully violate a rule flemming said 
he said most of the criticism of the school comes from 
outofstate he said his office has received 228 letters from 
outside texas and all but 10 supported zach 
from inside texas he said the mail is running about half in 
favor of zach and half in favor of school officials 
but in bastrop he said i have not had one citizen come up to 
me personally and say we are opposed to the rule i have had 
numerous people say we think youre right

filming began monday on a movie about former 
presidential press secretary james brady and his fight for survival 
after being shot nine years ago in john hinckley jrs attack on 
president reagan 
crews for hbo pictures filmed a reenactment monday of the 
attempted assassination at the washington hilton hotel on 
wednesday theyre scheduled to simulate the presidential motorcade 
the movies working title is the james brady story with 
beau bridges playing the lead it is based on the book thumbs 
up about bradys life since one of hinckleys shots struck him 
in the head nearly killing him reagan also was severely wounded 
but he recovered fully while brady suffered permanent impairment of 
his mobility and speech 
some of the extras in the movie include newsmen and 
photographers who were at the actual 1981 shooting 
primarily it is the story of jims and my family getting 
through the trauma more than the handguncontrol aspect of it 
said bradys wife sarah but i think it will probably bring a lot 
of attention to the subject of gun controls 
the bradys were consultants on the film

following are excerpts of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs speech monday to the congress of peoples deputies 
translated from russian by the associated press 
 
comrade deputies the present situation in the country is 
difficult the crisis is growing in the economy in social and 
political spheres and especially in interethnic relations 
dissatisfaction is growing with the actions of central republican 
and local organs of power especially actions of executive organs 
even in the course of perestroika serious errors and 
miscalculations have been made by the leadership we underestimated 
the depth of the crisis in the society but we cannot give way 
to panic we must not succumb to the pressure of the present 
difficulties and most importantly we must act to remove the most 
serious dangers and use all opportunities opened by perestroika 
 
we have destroyed the foundations of the totalitarian 
administrative command system which chained our society for 
decades we have started to transform property relations to 
create incentives for the individual to make him the owner of the 
means of production and of the fruits of his labor and to liberate 
his initiative 
our foreign policies have had a decisive contribution in a 
healthier international atmosphere together with other states we 
have removed the danger of a global nuclear war our soldiers have 
returned from afghanistan and i am sure that nothing like that 
will ever be repeated 
the only reasonable policies now will consist of joint efforts 
to stop the deepening of the crisis and overcome our weaknesses and 
negative tendencies that have become apparent in our society and 
within a year or year and a half to bring our country onto the 
broad road of normal healthy development toward renewal 
if we have firm power discipline and control over the 
execution of decisions well be able to set normal food supplies 
rope in criminals and stop interethnic hostilities if we 
cannot achieve it discord will inevitably grow and evil forces 
will rage and the state will crumble 
the communist party is a natural and indispensable part of the 
forces the cooperation of these public forces will make it 
possible to achieve the ultimate goal of perestroika the renewal 
of our society in the framework of socialist choice on the way to 
a movement toward humane and democratic socialism 
under the new system the president who is the head of state 
will directly guide the cabinet of ministers unite and coordinate 
the activities of all supreme organs of union power and government 
and it is important that a vice president should be working 
alongside the president with permanent functions of his own who 
would at the same time fulfill specific tasks put forward by the 
president 
the council of the federation as part of the presidential 
power will also have a new role this is related to the 
transformation of our state into a union of sovereign republics 
 
the sovereignty of the republics is a historically irreversible 
stage in the development of our country but while drawing away 
from overcentralization we must not allow for the union to grow 
into an amorphous entity we proceed from the inviolability of 
the principle that each nation has the right to selfdetermination 
but it is the precisely the nation as a whole that has this right 
the best form for expressing the will of the nation is a 
referendum and im making a proposal for the congress 
consideration to hold a referendum in the entire country so that 
each citizen should express him or herself in favor or against of 
union of sovereign states on the basis of a federation 
the results of the referendum in each republic would be become 
the final verdict as for secession from the union it can only be 
carried out on the basis of the appropriate law with due regard to 
all aspects of this complex political and socioeconomic process 
 
we have come across a situation where republics and other 
national and territorial entities adopt changes in their legal 
status ignoring the acting constitution of the ussr this 
guerrillatype approach can lead to serious disorders and simple 
chaos this is a road to nowhere so i think its necessary for 
the congress of peoples deputies to state firmly that until the 
union treaty is signed that the constitution remains the 
supreme legislative statute 
we particularly need strong power to launch a decisive offensive 
against crime to deliver a merciless blow against bandits 
economic sabotage bribery profiteering thievery and hooliganism 
special structures to fight organized crime are being 
established under the president 
the armed forces are responsible for the defense of our state 
the army is the main foundation of state sovereignty its internal 
and external stability 
i think that this congress should decisively condemn slurs 
against our armed forces and discrimination against them i 
want to stress that the problems of the armed forces will be a 
priority of the presidential power and its organs 
the utmost priority to be tackled immediately by the presidency 
and its organs is the food problem what is happening now is not 
simply a shortage of food it is a consequence of disorder lack of 
control criminal negligence it is a result of unheardof 
disruption of deliveries by republics and regions of economic ties 
and normal relations between the city and countryside 
i want to reaffirm that we are capable of ensuring in 1991 on 
the basis of domestic production and purchases from abroad a per 
capita consumption not lower than this years level but we need to 
bring order the consumption of food resources i mean gathering 
transportation preservation processing and above all 
distribution and trade

considering the experience this year and disruption of 
deliveries to industrial centers i have proposed that republics 
should sign an agreement for 1991 on the issues of food supplies 
this agreement must be signed while the congress is in session 
 
nineteen ninetyone should be a turning point in reforming land 
ownership relations i propose that this congress adopt a special 
resolution stating that starting jan 1 farmers and all 
individuals should be allowed to lease without any obstacles land 
to use during their lifetime and with the right to pass on to their 
children 
a presidential decree will be passed recommending that local 
organs give additional land to current owners of small private 
plots who want it five million hectares 12350000 acres 
will be needed for this 
i have given instructions to draft a temporary agreement between 
republics on economic issues for 1991 the draft has been 
considered in all republics and we have their remarks it will be 
redrafted and signed this will remove obstacles to normal 
functioning of the state during the period of transition to the 
market 
the priority issue now in the country is to normalize the 
monetary system and reduce the state budget deficit for that 
purpose the following measures will be taken a sharp decrease in 
capital investment in industry freezing of unfinished construction 
and selling off uncompleted facilities concentrating finances and 
resources on those facilities that are nearly completed sharp 
decreases in subsidies to moneylosing enterprises cuts in 
expenditures for administration and management requiring more 
enterprises to be selfsufficient cuts in military expenditure 
end to issuing money to cover the budget deficit incentives for 
increasing individual savings accounts and sales of major consumer 
items apartments and construction materials 
starting jan 1 the state bank will be taken out of the 
executive organs at the same time a large number of jointstock 
and cooperative banks will be formed and other nonstate banks will 
be formed 
denationalization must not be reduced to a change of labels or 
to transferring enterprises from the union to the republics 
because it will lead to a change from the dictate of union 
ministries to an equally tough dictate of republics ministries 
i have given instructions for a draft on denationalization and 
demonopolization programs to be prepared it must be discussed and 
considered most carefully but by society at large and the organs 
of legislative power and adopted only after that 
our investment policies will focus on the development of 
hightech and lowwaste industries military conversion will play a 
major role it will consist of modernization of the entire 
machinebuilding complex in cooperation with foreign partners 
we have given up state monopoly on foreign trade given 
enterprises the right of access to the international market given 
up ideologyridden approaches which used to lead to waste of 
resources in relations with some countries 
nineteen ninetyone is going to be our most difficult year the 
highpoint of servicing our foreign loans will be in 1991 in 1992 
the payments will decrease by 50 percent negotiations have been 
held with leaders of some countries on opening credit but 
everyone realizes that however important foreign aid may be the 
credit itself wont solve our problems we must count on our forces 
and organization and determination in transition to the market as 
well as the toughest austerity regime 
prices will be regulated by supply and demand eventually but 
this cannot be done overnight in our imbalanced market 
uncontrolled price growth would have a severe impact on the living 
standards of many people 
i am giving all appropriate due to the tremendous input made by 
intellectuals working in the arts science and technology at 
the same time i must say that a large part of the intellectuals 
wasted their efforts in sorting out our relationship with the past 
and relations among other intellectuals those people render poor 
service to society and are accustomed to iciting destructive 
passions destabilizing public consciousness 
now more than ever we need discipline and selfdiscipline 
civil conciliation hard and selfless labor and confidence in our 
own forces we must not give up ourselves or frighten people with a 
looming catastrophe the entire society all work collectives and 
every individual must proceed from words to deeds and decisively 
move forward

a judge monday overturned the conviction of 
a man accused of sexually assaulting a woman who doctors say has 46 
personalities ruling a defense psychiatrist should have been 
allowed to examine the woman 
winnebago county circuit judge robert hawley ordered a new trial 
for mark a peterson 29 of oshkosh the judges action came at 
the request of district attorney joseph paulus whose handling of 
the case has been widely criticized and followed an advisory 
opinion by the state attorney generals office that the jury 
conviction should be reversed 
paulus said he has not decided if he will reprosecute the 
exgrocery store bagger and will consult with the womans doctors 
about whether she could handle another trial the judge set a 
thursday hearing to determine if another trial will be held 
george curtis the lawyer for the oshkosh woman said his client 
is willing to testify at a second trial but that he would advise 
against it 
i dont think it was in her best interests to go through it 
the first time he said i hate to see her beat around any more 
by many people who lost sight of both the victims rights and the 
accuseds rights 
a jury found peterson guilty nov 8 of seconddegree sexual 
assault in a trial that raised new questions about sexual consent 
mental illness and a rare condition called multiple personality 
disorder 
jurors accepted paulus arguments that peterson manipulated one 
of the womans personalities to have sex with him in his car 
wisconsin law forbids sexual contact with mentally ill people who 
cannot understand the consequences of their action 
peterson who is married testified during the trial that he 
didnt know the woman was mentally ill and said she consented to 
have sex with him 
the 27yearold woman said she had no idea she had sex until 
other personalities revealed it to her the case attracted 
widespread media attention and the woman later was interviewed for 
numerous tabloid television shows 
the surprise ruling granting a new trial followed the attorney 
generals office opinion that said a defense psychiatrist should 
have been allowed to examine the woman before the trial 
the judges refusal to allow such an examination would be held 
to be a denial of the defendants right to access to evidence 
relevant to his defense the opinion said 
petersons new lawyer mary sue robinson predicted her client 
would not face another trial and suggested paulus found a 
convenient way to end the circus surrounding the case 
i am sure there is careful thought being given how to lay this 
thing to rest she said the record in this case is a mess from 
several points of view the camera lights just got too bright for 
everybody i dont think there is anybody who participated in that 
trial who would like to have the appellate court read the record 
much less the supreme court 
curtis said he also expected no new charges would be brought 
against peterson the prosecutor has found a way to get out from 
underneath it he said 
ms robinson had listed nine separate grounds in her bid to get 
a new trial for peterson the only one addressed in the judges 
ruling was whether a defense psychiatrist should have been allowed 
to examine the victim 
she said peterson who faced up to 10 years in prison for the 
conviction has been devastated by the case and has been unable 
to find a job because of publicity

secretary of state james a baker iii 
privately cautioned israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir against 
deporting palestinian arabs before four gaza residents were ordered 
expelled a state department spokesman said monday 
the four palestinians were described by the israeli army as 
middleranking leaders of the islamic resistance movement an 
extremist group also known as hamas that claimed responsibility for 
the slaying of three israeli workers in an aluminum factory in 
jaffa on friday 
all of them are known activists of hamas and all took part in 
directing and organizing the violent activities of this 
organization the israeli army said 
earlier in the week israeli defense minister moshe arens had 
warned that deportations would be resumed after a 16month 
suspension israel has expelled some 60 palestinians suspected of 
involvement in terrorist activities and antiisraeli 
incitement 
baker met with shamir over breakfast last thursday toward the 
end of the prime ministers visit to washington while the session 
was held before the murders and resulting expulsion order the 
issue already was in the public domain department spokesman 
richard boucher said 
baker made very clear to shamir that the bush administration 
considers deportations of residents of the west bank and gaza in 
violation of the geneva conventions provisions dealing with 
occupied territories boucher said 
charges of wrongdoing should be brought in a court of law 
the us official said 
even if they are convicted palestinians from the territories 
should not be deported but sent to prison within the territories 
the department said later in a brief statement 
the spokeswoman for the israeli embassy ruth yaron said shamir 
had told baker that he was aware of the us position on 
deportations but that israel had to deal with a very difficult 
situation 
sometimes shamir said israel has no choice but to resort to 
such tactics but it does not issue deportation orders 
indiscriminately or in a massive way and issues such orders only 
after careful consideration and when there is no alternative mrs 
yaron said 
besides the israeli official said shamir reminded baker that 
palestinians who are given deportation orders have a right to 
appeal to the israeli supreme court 
israel which signed the international treaty contends that the 
pact refers to mass deportations and not to expulsions of 
individuals 
besides bakers admonition to shamir the bush administration 
made a point of registering its disapproval in two other ways john 
kelly the assistant secretary of state for the near east 
complained to ambassador zalman shoval here over the weekend and 
the us embassy in tel aviv complained to the foreign and defense 
ministries 
obviously we condemn the recent attacks on israelis and the 
deaths which have resulted boucher said in reading a statement 
that emphasized us disapproval of israels deportations policy 
in a related dispute the state department also criticized 
israel for authorizing snipers to deter palestinian attacks 
the use of live fire even by trained sharpshooters raises the 
likelihood of more deaths and injuries and is an inappropriate 
response to the threat caused by stonethrowers the department 
said in a statement 
we believe that the use of force should be proportionate to 
the action it is intended to prevent we have raised our concerns 
with the government of israel 
the statement said baker also took up the use of snipers with 
shamir at their meeting on thursday

president mikhail s gorbachev on monday swept 
aside a demand that he resign for bringing his people 
devastation hunger cold blood tears and he called for a 
national referendum on forming a new federation 
in an hourlong address to the congress of peoples deputies the 
national parliament gorbachev said citizens would vote on whether 
they want to form a union of sovereign states on a federative 
basis 
but he said republics that want to secede must follow laws 
requiring a separate referendum and a waiting period of up to five 
years 
we must not let the soviet union disintegrate this would 
have a devastating effect on millions of people gorbachev told 
them 
the 59yearold kremlin leaders popularity has plummeted amid 
shortages of food and consumer goods more crime and increased 
ethnic conflicts thousands of demonstrators have demanded he quit 
but never before had the issue come to a formal vote in parliament 
despite the russian federation parliaments approval this month 
of private ownership of land gorbachev stuck to a conservative 
line again proposing a nationwide referendum on the issue 
he offered few new solutions in his state of the union address 
and took a decidedly cautious tone his speech received a few 
seconds of light applause from the 2000 lawmakers gathered in the 
kremlin 
he urged lawmakers to approve constitutional amendments to 
strengthen presidential power by adding a vice president and 
replacing the 89member council of ministers with a cabinet of 
about 15 people 
gorbachev also would create a national security council 
responsible for military and intelligence matters 
at the start of the 10day congress a nervous delegate asked 
gorbachev to resign in a demand broadcast live to millions on 
television and radio 
mikhail sergeyevich does not have the moral right to hold his 
post said lawmaker sazhi umulatova a communist party 
hardliner you brought devastation hunger cold blood tears 
innocent people are perishing 
her voice shaking she called for a noconfidence vote her 
proposal to put such a vote on the congress agenda was defeated 
1288 to 426 and gorbachev did not mention it 
presidential aide georgy shakhnazarov later told reporters 
gorbachev wants a referendum because he thinks secession is too 
important for legislators in the republics to decide themselves as 
they did in the baltics 
some people make statements that the union isnt needed lets 
ask the people let them decide shakhnazarov said 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia already 
have declared independence and the 12 other soviet republics have 
proclaimed some form of sovereignty lithuania and armenia 
boycotted mondays proceedings 
the principle of a union of sovereign states is contained in 
gorbachevs union treaty which the congress is to consider before 
its scheduled end dec 27 
the treaty would preserve central control over national security 
and key industries such as energy and transportation most 
republics are demanding that the national government also hand over 
the power to make all economic decisions 
gorbachevs main political rival russian federation president 
boris yeltsin said monday that the proposed referendum on a 
federation would be a waste of time 
yeltsin also told reporters he expected to hear nothing new from 
gorbachevs speech and my expectations came true 
yeltsin whose popularity far exceeds gorbachevs sat next to 
the soviet president but the two did not speak to each other at 
length 
estonian lawmaker marju lauristin told reporters gorbachevs 
speech was weak and showed he had lost his democratic and radical 
supporters and is depending more and more on conservative forces 
such as the hardline parliamentary group soyuz 
but soyuz leader victor alksnis complained that gorbachev gave 
the congress no concrete program for solving problems 
president nursultan nazarbayev of kazakhstan who has been 
mentioned as a possible vice president to gorbachev blasted 
gorbachevs plan for switching to a free market as not radical 
enough and criticized his begging for bread in western europe 
his speech received more than 20 seconds of applause far more 
than gorbachevs 
the congress the countrys highest lawmaking body has the 
right to approve proposed constitutional changes but only the 
republics have the power to approve the union treaty 
gorbachev admitted making mistakes during his nearly six years 
in power but said the soviet people can overcome them within 18 
months while moving to a market economy 
we have learned a lesson but we should not be 
panicstricken he said 
the soviet union gorbachev said should not return to the 
limitless dictatorship and arbitrariness we have condemned and 
rejected 
he criticized republics and regions that declare sovereignty and 
disrupt economic ties and rejected their pronouncements that local 
legislation takes precedence over national measures 
gorbachev blasted some members of the intelligentsia whom he 
traditionally has wooed to back his reforms for acting 
irresponsibly in ethnic disputes 
and in a step that shakhnazarov conceded was antimarket 
gorbachev ordered businesses to retain through next year the fixed 
prices and contracts they used for trade in 1990

police blocked thousands of palestinians from 
entering jerusalem on monday and sent hundreds of flakjacketed 
officers into the walled old city to prevent clashes caused by 
heightened arabisraeli tensions 
officials also denied a request by jewish extremists to enter 
jerusalems temple mount site of the jews ancient temple two 
historic mosques now stand on the site and moslems call it the 
noble sanctuary 
the steppedup security was intended both to prevent trouble on 
the mount where police killed 17 palestinians during oct 8 
rioting and violence over israels planned deportation of four 
leaders of the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal 
the planned deportations stirred new anger among palestinians 
many of whom were driven out of israel with the 1948 founding of 
the jewish state israeli outrage was heightened by the stabbing 
deaths of three jews on friday which precipitated the deportation 
orders hamas was blamed in the three deaths 
hamas published a leaflet monday calling for suicide missions 
against israelis and a war of attrition aimed at undermining 
israels selfconfidence arab reports said 
in the occupied territories at least three antideportation 
demonstrations were reported monday israel radio said soldiers 
fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a march at the closed 
bir zeit university in the west bank 
police set up roadblocks around jerusalem to block palestinians 
coming from the occpied west bank and gaza strip 
officers also turned away young men trying to enter the noble 
sanctuary 
secretary of state james a baker iii privately cautioned 
visiting israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir in washington last 
thursday against deporting palestinian arabs state department 
spokesman richard boucher said monday 
he said baker made very clear that washington views such 
deportations as violating the geneva convention dealing with 
occupied territories 
israel says the convention refers to mass deportations not 
expulsions of individuals 
more than a dozen members of the extremist jewish group temple 
mount faithful ignored police orders against demonstrations by 
marching with israeli flags near the site 
the group wants to enter the mount for hanukkah the jewish 
festival of lights in october tensions over a planned march by 
the group during the sukkot jewish holiday helped set off the riot 
and fatal police shootings 
gershon salomon leader of the faithful said monday his group 
would persist in its effort to rebuild the jewish temple on the 
present site of the 7th and 8th century al aqsa and dome of the 
rock mosques 
the army announced meanwhile that a military board hearing 
appeals of the four deportation orders was to sit for a second day 
tuesday after accepting defense requests for more time to study the 
case 
the four men ordered deported are all from the occupied gaza 
strip 
police said slogans signed by hamas were painted on the wall at 
the murder scene in the tel aviv suburb of jaffa in ordering the 
deportations officials blamed the men for inciting the slayings 
but not for direct involvement in the killings 
during the 3yearold palestinian uprising israel has deported 
60 residents of the west bank and gaza strip it stopped the 
practice in august 1989 reportedly under pressure from us 
officials 
in the gaza strip israel opened a new air strip monday to serve 
the gush katif settlement home to about 3000 jews living among 
the 750000 palestinians in the seaside strip 
israel radio quoted transport minister moshe katzav as saying 
air service could increase tourism to a beach resort built by 
settlers in the south of gaza near khan yunis refugee camp

a mild earthquake shook westcentral 
indiana early monday and officials said it had no connection to 
the infamous new madrid fault elsewhere in the midwest 
no damage or injuries were reported 
the quake shortly after midnight measured 30 on the richter 
scale said larry braile professor of geosciences at purdue 
university 
it was felt from lafayette to crawfordsville in west central 
indiana according to the national earthquake information center in 
golden colo 
it was centered two or three miles northwest of delphi and it 
occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers which is very common in the 
midwest said kelly stemnock earthquake program manager for the 
state emergency management agency 
delphi is about 50 miles northwest of indianapolis and about 12 
miles northeast of lafayette 
each year we record between 10 to 20 events of this magnitude 
in the midwest for the most part these events are random and 
scattered and unrelated to any major fault zone braile said 
two other unrelated mild earthquakes one in california and 
another in pennsylvania also were reported monday 
the california quake centered about 60 miles east of los 
angeles registered 35 on the richer scale the pennsylvania 
quake centered near erie registered 25 on the richter scale 
authorities said 
the quakes came about two weeks after the date climatologist 
iben browning had projected a 5050 chance for a major quake along 
the new madrid fault causing concern in parts of indiana 
arkansas missouri illinois and kentucky brownings projection 
was based on tidal changes and was dismissed by other scientists a 
major quake didnt occur along that fault 
indiana is not on the new madrid fault line but an earthquake 
there could cause damage in southern indiana stemnock said

the pentagon on monday charged that a house 
committees report on the strategic defense initiative is basically 
a rewrite of a fundamentally flawed congressional report 
released in july 
there are a number of problems with the conclusions and 
finding of both reports the pentagons strategic defense 
initiative organization said in a onepage statement responding to 
the study done by the government operations committee 
the panel report issued sunday cited a general accounting 
office study issued this past summer that raised serious questions 
about deploying the first phase of the strategic defense system 
commonly known as star wars in 1993 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said detailed tests planned by the sdio wouldnt be 
completed by the time the president has to decide whether to go 
ahead with deployment 
based on the problems of incomplete testing the general 
accopunting office said it did not believe the will be able to 
give the president enough information to support a 1993 decision to 
deploy phase 1 
the incorporation of the brilliant pebbles concept into the 
strategic defense system in january drastically changed its design 
leaving it in a state of flux brilliant pebbles are several 
thousand interceptors that would orbit the earth to seek and 
destroy a target by smashing into it at high speeds 
the house committee chaired by rep john conyers dmich 
warned that brilliant pebbles could become the next version of the 
illfated hubble telescope the 15 billion telescope whose 
primary mirror is flawed and provides a blurred view of its viewing 
targets 
responding to the reports the sdio said the 1993 decision was 
never a decision on whether to deploy but rather a choice on moving 
toward fullscale development 
given recent budget cuts all decisions have been delayed by 
at least two years and deployment of brilliant pebbles would not 
begin before late in this decade the sdio said 
the organization also contends that the general accounting 
office exaggerated the changes in design of the system after the 
introduction of brilliant pebbles it also said the president could 
make a decision on the system with the tests planned 
the organization added that cost estimates are continuing to 
drop a trend which we believe all in congress should support 
the recent house goverment operations committee report on the 
strategic defense initiative is essentially a rewrite of a 
fundamentally flawed gao report released earlier this year the 
sdio said

city supervisors on monday approved the 
nations broadest video display terminal safety law rejecting the 
arguments of opponents who had said the law would be too expensive 
for employers 
its historic supervisor angela alioto said of the 
ordinance its on the cutting edge of an extremely important 
area for all workers in america 
the supervisors voted 74 in favor of the law monday mayor art 
agnos has said he is sympathetic to the need for vdt safety but he 
has said he is uncertain about signing the ordinance in its present 
form citing the costs 
agnos said he would meet with business and labor leaders over 
the next couple of weeks he has 10 days to act on the legislation 
and the board can till make changes 
i plan to listen carefully to the concerns of both sides 
before making up my mind agnos said 
even if agnos rejects the measure the 11member board of 
supervisors could overturn the veto with eight votes 
the law would require city government and businesses with 15 or 
more employees to provide those who work on video display terminals 
at least four hours a day with adjustable chairs glare shields 
detachable keyboards tables with sufficient leg space and special 
lamps to reduce vision impairment 
vdt workers also would be allowed 15minute breaks every two 
hours and an advisory committee would monitor information about 
the health effects of vdt use including the possible effects of 
radiation 
companies would have two years to implement the law after that 
violators could be fined up to 500 per day 
city budget analysts estimate that san francisco would have to 
spend 14 million to 6 million during the next two years to 
comply with the bill and private businesses would have to spend 
315 million to 765 million 
this is a message to the nation that this is the next wave of 
worker safety issues said supervisor nancy walker who 
cosponsored the ordinance with alioto if this were 100 years ago 
we might have been debating child labor laws here today and been 
told it was none of our business 
the chamber of commerce opposed the ordinance claiming it would 
drive business from the city jim lazarus chamber vice president 
said monday he would urge the mayor to veto the bill 
the vdt coalition which represents unions computer workers and 
community groups cited studies that show provisions in the law 
would actually save businesses money 
vdts are associated with a wrist ailment called carpal tunnel 
syndrome nerve damage to the wrists and fingers back and neck 
strain eyestrain sleep disturbances chronic headaches nausea 
and fatigue 
one case of carpal tunnel syndrome can cost 70000 when lost

members of one of the wests largest communist 
parties gather on tuesday for their first party congress since the 
fall of communist rule in eastern europe but the leadership is 
expected to block major reform 
secretarygeneral george marchais is heavily favored to win 
reelection and kill proposed overhauls of his policies but never 
before in 18 years as french communist party chief has he faced 
such vigorous challenges from fellow communists 
the congresses held every three years are the highestlevel 
forum for choosing leadership and setting policy this one will be 
held in the workingclass paris suburb of saintouen exactly 70 
years after the partys founding congress in tours 
the communists hold 26 of 577 seats in the national assembly in 
1946 they held 182 seats the most of any party but their share 
dropped to 44 in 1981 and 35 in 1986 
the party claims 600000 members but even some of its own 
activists suggest this figure is excessive communists control the 
municipal councils in 1097 communities but only one with more 
than 100000 people le havre 
the general confederation of labor a communist ally remains 
the largest french labor federation but its membership has dropped 
from 16 million to 4 million since 1977 
marchais 70 says he has been a longtime supporter of the type 
of reform being implemented by soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
marchais critics say the party continues to function in an 
undemocratic way they also contend that the lessons of eastern 
europe have not been heeded by marchais although he did assert in 
march that french communists had been duped by soviet bloc 
leaders 
marchais most prominent rival is charles fiterman who served 
as transport minister in the early 1980s during a brief alliance 
between the communists and governing socialists 
fiterman wants the party to modernize its platform and open up 
its decisionmaking process 
although fitermans proposals face likely rejection at the 
fiveday congress he has benefited from one change this year a 
decision to allow some internal dissent to appear in the opinion 
columns of the partys daily newspaper lhumanite 
some party dissidents including lhumanites own moscow 
correspondent bernard frederick say their commentaries remain 
barred from these opinion pages 
but some fairly blunt criticism of marchais has appeared in the 
newspaper one article by jeanpierre brard asked how 
insightful is a leadership which wasnt able to distinguish the 
truth from the lies during its conversations with the heads of the 
easts communist countries 
despite its problems it received under 10 percent of the vote 
in recent elections the french communist party remains one of the 
largest in the west 
the largest in italy is undergoing a major selfexamination 
its leader achille occhetto has proposed dropping the word 
communist from the partys name

the death toll in last weeks fiery 
83car interstate pileup has been lowered once again from 13 to 
12 authorities said monday 
investigators initially reported that 15 people died in the dec 
11 crash on a fogbound stretch of interstate 75 about 40 miles 
northeast of chattanooga the next day they lowered the number of 
fatalities to 13 saying the scattered condition of the body parts 
caused them to count some victims twice 
the same confusion accounted for the latest discrepancy said 
dr iris snider assistant mcminn county medical examiner 
that gives you an idea of the shape everything was in the 
doctor said we started out with 15 body bags 
she said that after studying certain body parts sunday she 
suspected that what she thought were two victims were actually one 
that hunch was confirmed when the victims wife identified a 
certain piece of jewelry she said 
all the victims had been identified by monday officials said 
the chainreaction pileup occurred on a stretch of i75 that is 
notorious for morning fog between 1974 and 1979 there were six 
fogrelated multivehicle accidents along the road

president bush said monday he would nominate 
former tennessee gov lamar alexander as education secretary 
choosing a teachers son with a reputation as an education reformer 
to take over a department recently troubled by controversy 
bush made no mention of last weeks abrupt departure of his 
first education secretary lauro cavazos who was forced to resign 
by the white house praise for the choice of alexander currently 
president of the university of tennessee was quick and widespread 
suggesting there would be no lingering ill effects from the firing 
of cavazos 
meanwhile sources said the administration had decided to 
reverse a ruling by the education departments office of civil 
rights that colleges could not award scholarships on the basis of 
race alone 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was very 
disturbed by a department officials ruling last week that such 
scholarships are illegal 
bush believes these scholarships are important to minorities 
and to ensuring opportunities for all americans to get a good 
education and has ordered the department to conduct a quick 
review with advice from the justice department and white house 
lawyers fitzwater said 
alexander refused to be drawn into the controversy saying in 
answer to questions that he had many many opinions about it and 
would be willing to be full of advice to the president and the 
senate 
my general disposition would be that when youre wandering 
through constitutional thickets that a warm heart and a little 
common sense sometimes are helpful he said noting that the 
university of tennessee offers scholarships to poor minority 
students 
the president announcing his choice of alexander said no 
governor in the country is so clearly identified with the 
imperative to improve education in america 
lamar if youll remember was at the forefront of the 
movement to restructue our nations schools bush said when 
he was chairman of the national governors association he was 
instrumental in bringing education reform to the very top of the 
agenda 
alexander 50 left the tennessee governors office in 1986 
after two terms and moved to australia for six months in 1988 he 
was appointed to his university post 
he said his goals in addition to improving schools for the 
nations children will include creating better training and adult 
education opportunities for american workers who need new skills 
for the changing workplace 
alexander said that when tennessee was looking for workers for a 
new general motors plant families considering the move had two 
concerns 
the second question is where can i get good schools for my 
children and the first question is where can i go back to 
school he said 
while governor alexander unveiled an education reform package 
called better schools that included adding a career ladder of pay 
raises for teachers and principals expanding basic education 
curriculum putting computers in junior high schools and hiring 
more math and science teachers 
in early reaction to the choice 
richard f rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities called alexander one of 
the best people in the country in terms of background and 
understanding of education rosser added he also is known as a 
thoughtful moderate republican and clearly we need someone who 
is going to be in the mainstream in terms of their thinking of what 
needs to be done in education 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said he was optimistic that alexander could bring to the 
department some of the dynamism that critics said it lacked under 
cavazos he said he hoped alexander would not be as zealous as 
others in the bush administration in pushing the concept of public 
school choice as the key to school reform 
ernest boyer head of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said every signal suggests that not 
only does he have strong commitment but a realistic sense of what 
the priorities should be it seems to me that hes looked at reform 
more broadly there is nothing in his past record to suggest that 
hes be narrow or ideological 
bushs choice of alexander three days after picking rep lynn 
martin of illinois as labor secretary fills his cabinet for now 
although there is much talk that at least one more member may leave 
soon perhaps to take the vacant position of chairman of the 
republican national committee 
the nominations will be considered by the senate labor and human 
resources committee the panels chairman sen edward m kennedy 
dmass said monday that alexander has a distinguished record in 
education and earned bipartisan respect for his role in stimulating 
education reform in the states 
alexander told bush monday that his parents were teachers and 
that as governor i discovered that our states major need was 
better schools colleges and universities 
he received a law degree at new york university and later 
supplemented his income as a law clerk in new orleans by playing 
the trombone in a dixieland band at night

food and drug administration officials said 
monday they were looking into reports that a drug commonly used to 
sedate children may cause cancer 
the concerns were raised by california state health director 
kenneth kizer who said that if carcinogenity is confirmed by an 
environmental protection agency study the fda should issue a 
warning about the drug 
in a letter to fda commissioner david kessler last week kizer 
said interim results from the epa study found cancer in mice that 
were given oral chloral hydrate 
these findings along with those from other studies raise 
serious concerns about carcinogenic risks kizer said 
interviews with health care professionals who prescribe 
dispense and administer chloral hydrate including neonatologists 
pediatricians pedodontists and hospital pharmacists indicate 
that these practitioners are unaware of the carcinogenic risks of 
this drug he wrote 
kizer sent with his letter brief summaries of more than 20 
studies conducted during the 1970s and 1980s involving chloral 
hydrate the findings ranged from changes in cell development to 
genetic mutations in one study young mice got cancer after a 
single dose of the drug 
fda spokeswoman eva kemper said the fda had received the 
letterbut at this point we have no comment she said the 
agency was looking into the matter 
epa officials conducting the study in cincinnati ohio had left 
for the day and could not be reached for comment 
chloral hydrate has been sold for many years as a branded and a 
generic product for use as a hypnotic and sedative it was used 
widely before the federal government began regulating drugs in 
1938 which means it was never subjected to the kind of scrutiny 
that new drugs are 
it is used by doctors and dentists as a sedative for children to 
keep them still for examinations also neonatologists give it to 
newborns on ventilators 
ed brewton vice president of scientific affairs at roxane 
laboratories inc said his company has been getting calls after 
reports of the possible cancer risk associated with the drug 
roxane makes generic chloral hydrate products including an oral 
syrup and soft gelatin capsules he said 
he said he was first alerted to concerns by a letter that 
appeared in the journal science in october in which a university 
of california professor raised questions about pediatric use of 
chloral hydrate because of cancer risks

away from retaining his title 
kasparov who leads anatoly karpov by 11 points to nine has now 
used up all three of the timeouts allotted to him karpov has one 
timeout remaining 
karpov will have the advantage of the white pieces in the 21st 
match but his chances of overall victory have virtually 
disappeared he would need to win three of the final four matches 
and draw the other to win back the title he lost to kasparov in 
1985 
of the 20 games played thus far in new york and lyon kasparov 
has won four and karpov two with draws in the others kasparov has 
won the last three times he has played with the white pieces 
including a brilliant victory in the 20th game on saturday 
he would retain the title in the event of a 1212 tie and thus 
needs only one more victory or two ties karpov needs 125 points 
to win 
the victor earns 17 million of a 3 million purse plus a

pain and death in the salvadoran civilian population and caused 
serious damage to the economic infrastructure of the country the 
communique said 
it was signed by presidents vinicio cerezo of guatemala rafael 
angel calderon of costa rica leonardo callejas of honduras 
violeta chamorro of nicaragua and cristiani president guillermo 
endara of panama attended as an observer 
a senior guerrilla commander maria marta valladares better 
known as nidia diaz called the communique biased and said the 
rebels will not heed it 
once again the central american presidents emit a resolution 
that is removed from the salvadoran reality she said in a 
telephone interview from guerrilla offices in mexico city 
it makes no sense to ask us to abandon the armed struggle as 
long as the causes that gave rise to the armed struggle are not 
overcome she said 
she said the rebels would keep acquiring and using sophisticated 
weapons as long as necessary 
the summit statement named the declaration of puntarenas for 
the pacific coast port where the presidents met demanded the 
guerrillas immediately halt use of sophisticated weaponry such as 
was used in the recent offensive it asked un central american 
observers to investigate the weapons origin 
the rebels used surfacetoair missiles to bring down an a37 
attack jet on nov 23 and an ac47 on dec 4 their first use of 
missiles to down warplanes 
cristiani said on his return to el salvador he was extremely 
pleased with the summits results 
if the fmln continues to ignore these calls it will lose more 
and more political space that allows it to generate violence 
cristiani said 
the missile incidents and increased guerrilla effectiveness with 
rifle fire against aircraft damaged pilots morale and made them 
more cautious guerrilla defeat of 200 elite troops last week was 
blamed in part on lack of air support 
the war has killed an estimated 73000 people it became the 
central issue of the talks as a result of the rebel offensive that 
began nov 20 last week government troops were driven across the 
border into honduras 
the summit statement reflected the salvadoran governments 
position in negotiations with the guerrillas rounds of talks held 
between may and september bogged down over rebel demands that the 
salvadoran army be reduced and purged of human rights violators 
the government says it will purge its ranks but without 
guerrilla help 
pressure from other regional presidents on the sandinista 
government in nicaragua helped force president daniel ortegas 
administration to allow free elections and the transfer of power to 
mrs chamorro who took office april 25 
the central american leaders scheduled their next meeting march 
1819 in nicaragua they also will meet with mexican president 
carlos salinas de gortari on jan 11 and 12 in tuxtla gutierrez

the security council consulted on monday 
night about draft resolutions that would deplore planned israeli 
deportations of palestinians and enhance protection of palestinians 
in israelioccupied lands 
the 15member council also was considering draft resolutions 
that would recognize the importance of a properly structured middle 
east peace conference 
all governments here believe israel is wrong to be deporting 
palestinians british ambassador david hannay said after 
consultations the most important thing is that we communicate to 
israel that it must stop 
the order to deport four palestinian activists linked to an 
extremist group has complicated the longdelayed council meeting 
aimed at increasing protection of palestinians under israeli 
occupation and expressing general support for a peace conference 
the united states has sought to cut out any reference to a 
conference from the heart of a resolution about protecting 
palestinians saying iraqi president saddam hussein might 
misinterpret that as linkage to the persian gulf crisis 
the meeting has been postponed three times recently at us and 
soviet urging they insist the arabisraeli question not be linked 
to the gulf crisis the kremlin has indicated it would support 
further delays 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on monday 
deplored the decision by israeli authorities to deport four 
palestinians from the occupied territories calling it a violation 
of the fourth geneva convention 
israel identified the four gaza strip residents as leaders of a 
group which claimed responsibility in the killing of three israeli 
workers in a jaffa factory on friday 
the fourth geneva convention prohibits expulsions but israel 
which signed the treaty says it does not apply to this case and 
refers only to mass deportations not individual expulsions 
the latest us draft resolution diplomats said monday would 
deplore planned deportation of palestinians and remove the 
reference to a mideast peace conference 
mention of a conference would be shifted to a nonbinding 
statement by the president of the council which also would 
categorically state there is no linkage between the arabisraeli 
dispute and the gulf crisis

premierdesignate dimitar popov said 
monday that an agreement has been struck on a new government to try 
to pull the balkan country out of a severe economic and political 
crisis 
popov said on government tv that the two main political forces 
the socialists and the union of democratic forces reached 
agreement on dividing up cabinet posts in the new government 
he did not identify any of the ministers but said only that 
they were respected and competent figures 
the new government which will serve until new elections next 
summer must still be formally approved by legislators before it 
can begin functioning 
popov a judge who is a member of neither leading faction was 
chosen to lead a new government after strikes and protests forced 
socialist premier andrei lukanov and his government of former 
communists to quit late last month 
the two sides came close to an agreement last week but a 
dispute over control of the interior ministry kept them apart the 
ministry is in charge of law enforcement 
parliamentary sources said the socialists will keep the interior 
and defense ministries while the opposition could name a vice 
premier with authority to observe their work 
the opposition gained the crucial finance ministry and the 
socialists will take the foreign trade ministry the sources said 
viktor volkov of the agrarian party will be designated foreign 
minister under the agreement sources said 
electricity and many consumer goods are rationed or simply 
unavailable in sofia and elsewhere in this country of 9 million 
people political bickering has prevented any government from 
attacking the problems

the house of commons voted by wide margins monday 
night against restoring capital punishment which was abolished by 
act of parliament in 1969 except for treason and piracy 
it follows the freeing of four people wrongly convicted of 
murder in irish republican army bombings and the scheduled hearing 
of appeals by six prisoners who say they also were wrongly 
convicted of murder in ira attacks 
legislators in a series of votes 
defeated 367182 a motion to introduce hanging for murder in 
general provided the court of appeal was given power to commute the 
sentence to life imprisonment if it thought fit 
defeated 350215 a motion tointroduce hanging for the 
murderer of a policeman 
defeated 349186 a motion to introduce hanging for murder by 
firearms explosives or offensive weapons 
but the house voted 289257 to retain hanging for treason and 
piracy at least for the time being after home secretary kenneth 
baker the cabinet member responsible for law and order indicated 
the government plans to consider the issue later 
legislators in each case voted according to conscience unbound 
by party instructions 
it is the ninth time since 1969 that the house has voted against 
restoring the death penalty in defiance of overwhelming public 
support for its reintroduction public opinion polls have show 
fourfifths of the british public want it restored 
the last hangings in britain of a convicted murderer and his 
accomplice occurred aug 13 1964 
prohanging conservative party legislator ivan lawrence said 
during the debate that the nation was overwhelmingly wanted capital 
punishment restored he said the deterrent of life imprisonment for 
murder had totally failed 
but baker warned about the danger of miscarriages of justice 
there is no appeal from the grave the possibility of an 
innocent person being hanged by mistake cannot be dismissed with a 
shrug he said 
there has been grave concern over the case of the guildford four 
three men from northern ireland and an english woman freed last 
year after 15 years in jail following conviction for murder 
three detectives who investigated the 1974 ira bombings at 
guildford southwest of london and at woolwich in southeast london 
will be charged with conspiring to obstruct justice the crown 
prosecution service announced last month seven people died in the 
two bombings 
appeals by another group of prisoners the birmingham six will 
be heard early next year the court of appeal said monday 
the six irishmen were jailed for life after being convicted of 
murder in 1975 in ira bombings at two pubs in birmingham in central 
england the previous year that killed 21 people critics allege 
police beat confessions out of them

the government issued a decree monday 
paving the way for a mass surrender by drug traffickers by lifting 
the threat of extradition 
hours earlier the bogota daily el espectador said granting 
concessions to the medellin cocaine cartel was like trying to 
appease adolf hitler 
president cesar gavirias administration clarified on monday 
earlier offers to drug traffickers who surrender and confess their 
crimes it said they will not be sent to face trial in the united 
states and will be eligible for reduced prison sentences 
those who accept this decree have an absolute guarantee that 
they will not be extradited justice minister jaime giraldo told 
foreign reporters 
the decree guarantees traffickers human rights appointing 
delegates from the attorney generals office to oversee their 
surrender 
but giraldo said the medellin cartels leader pablo escobar 
would still serve 20 years in prison if he surrendered and 
confessed all his crimes 
the cartel has been blamed for killing about 550 colombians 
including 250 medellin police in terrorist attacks since 
government and traffickers declared war on each other in august 
1989 after a presidential candidate was assassinated 
late last month drug bosses said between 200 and 300 
traffickers were willing to surrender in a heavily fortified 
compound protected by the army in exchange for legal guarantees 
from the government 
these include an end to extraditions and not being treated as 
criminals 
the governments decree said cocaine smugglers would have to 
confess at least one of their crimes to be eligible for the 
benefits giraldo said the traffickers would in fact be treated as 
criminals 
he said the government is preparing jail facilities for 
surrendering traffickers to be guarded by the army to protect drug 
barons from outside attack 
four midlevel traffickers were reported to have already accepted 
the governments offer and turned themselves in 
el espectador columnist ramiro de la espriella on monday likened 
government concessions to the failed policy of appeasing hitler 
before world war ii 
are drug traffickers really going to turn themselves in 
wouldnt it be more truthful to admit that were the ones who are 
surrendering and in exchange for what chamberlains peace he 
wrote 
he was referring to british prime minister neville chamberlain 
who championed appeasing nazi germany 
others also complained that colombia was going soft on drug 
traffickers after having sent them into retreat in an antinarcotics 
war fought now for nearly 1 years 
the massacres the hundreds of sacrificed policemen the 
soldiers the judges the innocent victims of bombs their names 
also count espriella wrote 
the justice minister said the decree was an attempt to end 
narcoterrorism by creating new judicial mechanisms 
it is the search for peace through justice giraldo said 
he said the police crackdown will continue full force and 
there will be no impunity for traffickers 
the cartel has begun freeing journalists it abducted in the past 
three months to show its desire to make peace 
four of nine abducted reporters have been released in the past 
month including orlando acevedo a television cameraman freed 
monday in medellin

portauprince haiti ap the us government said monday the 
rev jeanbertrand aristide was the apparent winner of haitis 
first fully democratic election 
widespread victory celebrations however were silenced in the 
capital when police killed a pregnant supporter of the leftist 
priest 
bernard w aronson assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs said a us delegation met with aristide 
monday morning and congratulated him on his victory in sundays 
balloting 
the us official cited no figures but said it was clear from 
partial returns that aristide had won without the need for a 
runoff 
we fully respect him as the apparent presidentelect of haiti 
and look forward to working closely with his government aronson 
said 
the killing of the woman was the first violence reported in 
connection with sundays balloting which international observers 
had described as the first fully democratic election in the 
caribbean nations turbulent 186year history 
the independent electoral council announced the first official 
results monday evening 24 hours after most polls closed 
with 27227 votes tabulated slightly more than 1 percent of 
the estimated 2 million total aristide had 19181 votes or 706 
percent former world bank official marc bazin 3410 or 126 
percent agronomist louis dejoie jr 1866 or 69 percent and 
evangelical preacher sylvio claude 745 or 27 percent 
the seven other candidates each received less than 2 percent of 
the vote the results came from four of the countrys nine 
provinces 
dejoie son of the late sen louis dejoie who lost an 
armycontrolled election to francois papa doc duvalier in 1957 
conceded defeat monday night saying we affirm clearly the 
people have spoken 
even before the results were known thousands of jubilant 
supporters of aristide a charismatic leftist priest had poured 
into the streets of the capital portauprince to celebrate his 
anticipated victory 
aristide a 37yearold firebrand told the poor during his 
campaign that they were following gods will to fight for their 
rights 
he was expelled from the conservative salesian order in 1988 for 
allegedly inciting class hatred he has said he would renounce the 
priesthood if elected complying with a vatican policy that priests 
cant hold public office 
the killing occurred at midday outside st jean bosco roman 
catholic church where aristide once preached and which was the 
site of an attack in september of 1988 in that violence thugs 
armed with machetes knives and pikes attacked the church during 
mass killing 12 parishioners and wounding 70 
in mondays shooting witnesses said about half a dozen 
policemen wearing gas masks pulled up in a blue police pickup truck 
and opened fire on hundreds of aristide supporters singing and 
dancing outside the church in the la salines slum 
lannis waters a photographer for the palm beach post in 
florida said he saw the policemen in the truck and heard gunfire 
but could not tell how many shots were fired into the crowd or 
why he said the crowd ran in panic 
from a photograph the dead woman appeared to be about seven 
months pregnant 
the celebrations died down nearly everywhere in portauprince 
not long after the shooting was reported on radio 
monday night governmentrun television showed footage of the 
dead woman and broadcast a statement by the military authorities 
denying any responsibility for her death 
police intervened in the area and fired shots into the air the 
statement said because demonstrators were threatening to lynch 
someone in haiti the military controls the police force 
haitis last attempt to hold democratic elections on nov 29 
1987 collapsed in a bloodbath when thugs supported by the army 
shot and hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and 
in the streets 
in the only major violence leading up to sundays election 
unknown gunmen hurled a grenade and fired bullets into an aristide 
campaign rally on dec 5 killing seven people and wounding more 
than 50 
despite that attack and fears that supporters of the fallen 
duvalier dictatorship would disrupt the election an estimated 70 
percent of eligible voters turned out sunday 
about 800 international observers including former president 
jimmy carter and 64 unarmed military security advisers monitored 
the election to help prevent fraud and ensure safety 
joao de medicis of brazil head of a un election monitoring 
team said monday the election was fair 
i think it was a very democratic election a very open 
election he said at a news conference there were some 
irregularities but in our opinion these irregularities did not 
affect the result 
the new government will replace the caretaker administration of 
president ertha pascaltrouillot a supreme court justice appointed 
in march 
bazin a 58yearold former world bank economist seen as the 
favorite by the us embassy and the business community was 
considered aristides top rival among his 10 opponents 
haitians also elected a 110member national assembly and local 
officials 
if no candidate won 50 percent of the vote a runoff was to be 
held jan 20 about 3 million voters 85 percent of the electorate 
were registered to vote 
a popular uprising overthrew jeanclaude duvalier in 1986 
ending the repressive dictatorship that began when francois 
duvalier assumed office in 1957 
but there have been a series of coups and failed elections since 
then and a climate of terror fostered by former members of the 
duvalier family militia the tonton macoutes

the medellin cocaine cartel and held 110 days was freed monday in

traffickers in a month five other reporters are still held 
a taxi left acevedo in front of the offices of the medellin

state planning officials have vetoed a 
proposal to use state money to turn a vacant electronics factory 
into the worlds largest contemporary art museum 
but one of those same officials said hours later monday the 
project has a chance to proceed 
gov michael s dukakis was one of the strongest backers of the 
proposed massachusetts museum of contemporary art or mass moca 
last week the state museum commission approved a scaleddown 
version of mass moca which was originally to cost more than 77 
million 
john i carlson deputy commissioner of the state division of 
capital planning and operations rejected the revised proposal 
monday citing problems with the financial arrangements but later 
in the day he released a statement saying he expects the problems 
to be worked out 
a pivotal issue here is that if sufficient operating funds are 
not available it is likely that the projected size of the opening 
facility may have to be reduced thus changing all the basic 
assumptions he said 
museum commission members and the governors press aides did not 
immediately return telephone calls monday 
the plan originally proposed by thomas krens who later became 
curator of the guggenheim museum in new york city caught the fancy 
of the art world when it was first unveiled four years ago 
krens who was said to be en route from europe also could not 
be reached supporters had said the museum could revitalize the 
economy of the small isolated industrial city of north adams a 
mill city perched in the berkshires in the states far northwest 
corner 
the mayor of north adamas refused to concede defeat i am 
fully confident this will fly despite the incompetence in those two 
departments said mayor john barrett iii referring to the 
capital planning and inspector general offices 
our governor is still in office and i and very confident he 
and his staff will be able to get things under control barrett 
said ive been belted before 
but state rep greg sullivan one of the museums most vocal 
opponents hailed the move the democrat called the project the 
worst example of misplaced priorities and upside down logic of the 
dukakis administration 
we cant deny essential services to mentally retarded and 
elderly people while we buy millions of dollars of modern art to be 
placed out in the berkshires sullivan said 
three years ago the state legislature authorized 35 million 
for the conversion of the 28building sprague electronics co mill 
the funding was contingent upon acceptance of a 17 million 
feasibility study by state capital planning and finance officials 
and the museum commission 
carlson said north adams had failed to come up with its 30 
percent share of the construction costs and planners failed to show 
that the museum could generate enough income to sustain itself

tens of thousands of students and 
workers including airline navigators who halted all domestic 
flights were on strike monday in an effort to pressure the 
government to step down 
premier petre roman vowed not to quit but he and president ion 
iliescu held talks with radu campeanu leader of one of the two 
main parliamentary opposition parties amid indications the 
opposition party might join the government 
the current cabinet is composed solely of members of the 
national salvation front which overwhelmingly won last mays 
elections after toppling and executing communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu in the december revolution 
critics of the front however accuse it of having many former 
communists 
campeanu leader of the national liberal party demanded last 
week that opposition parties join government to broaden support for 
tough but needed economic reform and to improve democracy 
he also demanded that roman be replaced by a neutral 
personality unaffiliated with the front 
but roman speaking on national television late sunday firmly 
rejected calls for his resignation and stressed that he had sided 
with all those who revolted against ceausescu 
i took part in the revolution and won along with it with a 
clean conscience and my wrath merged with the peoples he said 
and i will not budge unreasonable noise ambition for power will 
not budge me 
after meeting campeanu roman said the front was open to a 
sharing of responsibility in a difficult moment for romania 
iliescu told radio he was attempting to find a solution for 
the participtation of some opposition parties in government 
sources in the national peasant party the other main opposition 
party said they were not part of the emerging deal 
after the elections six months ago the two parties refused to 
become junior partners in a government led by the front 
the bucharest talks followed sundays antigovernment protests 
to mark the anniversary of the revolution that toppled ceausescu 
the demonstrations were far smaller than expected perhaps 
because roman moved to defuse mounting protest over economic reform 
by announcing dec 7 that price hikes on foodstuffs planned for 
january would be postponed until june 
thousands of people including many workers on strike flocked 
monday to the opera square in the western town of timisoara 
birthplace of the revolt against ceausescu 
their stoppage and a class boycott estimated to have the support 
of about 100000 students are part of an opposition campaign to get 
the government to resign because of its alleged neocommunist links 
and harsh economic reform 
price hikes that increased the cost of consumer goods twoand 
even threefold nov 1 and other economic reforms had fueled the new 
wave of antigovernment protest as the anniversary of last years 
revolution approached 
the most serious strike disruption monday appeared to come from 
a stoppage at the national airline tarom domestic flights were 
grounded and international flights took off with huge delays 
management announced that in view of a strike by navigators and 
other workers all flights would stop on wednesday 
workers who belong to a free trade union also went on strike 
alert at romanias staterun radio and television network

to the 900telephone number monday overloaded the service companys 
circuits and made the line temporarily inaccessible company 
officials said 
the problem was with our service bureau in dallas they were 
not prepared for the level of activity our announcement 
generated said david mayer space travel services president 
the company said the problem should be corrected by tuesday 
space travel services said that because of local laws people 
listing addresses in new york florida or rhode island would not be 
eligible for the flight deadline for entering the contest is dec 
1 1991 
the exact cost of the trip was not disclosed but mayer 
president of space travel services said it was more than the 12 
million paid by a japanese broadcast company which recently put a 
reporter aboard the station 
that would be difficult for us to get into right now mayer 
said when asked about cost it was a lot 
in addition to the revenue from the calls davidson said the 
company hoped to sell advertising space aboard the spacecraft 
some of things done in the past are commercial endorsements 
production promotions associated with the spaceflight he said 
were intending to pursue those were also looking to have our 
astronauts endorse products by wearing apparel or by drinking fizzy 
beverages as appropriate 
we also have the broadcast rights to this mission well be 
happy to negotiate for that 
company officials said they had checked with us officials and 
were told there was nothing illegal about the planned flight the 
national aeronautics and space administration suspended its plans 
to have civilians accompany astronauts in space after the 1986 
challenger disaster 
as for the soviets davidson said the ultimate reason for their 
participation is cash 
they realize there was a buck to be made and thats what they 
want to do with their space program mayer said 
art dula whose houstonbased space commerce corp markets 
soviet space services in the united states and negotiated the deal 
on behalf of space travel services termed the contract a natural 
evolutionary activity

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
dec 1017 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this year has been a disaster for local ad 
spending in newspapers and the prospects for improvement are not 
good without a turnaround in the economy a prominent industry 
forecaster said 
robert coen of the ad agency mccannerickson spoke dec 10 at 
the start of the weeklong painewebber media conference at which 
major media companies said overall us ad spending this year has 
grown at the slowest pace since 1975 and could slow even further 
next year 
coen said he expects us ad spending will rise 49 percent to 
1301 billion this year and 46 percent to 136 billion in 1991 
of that national ad spending will rise 67 percent to 736 
billion this year while local ad spending will increase a meager 
28 percent to 565 billion 
coen attributed the weak local picture to the poor business 
environment deteriorating consumer confidence and spending cuts by 
retailers due to their heavy debt loads 
he said rising unemployment and a sluggish housing market caused 
a deepening decline in classified ads and made it a disastrous 
year for local ad spending in newspapers 
national advertising on the other hand was stronger than 
expected partly because of increased competition for market share 
in categories such as coffee credit cards and mutual funds coen 
said 
for 1991 coen said he expects national ad spending growth will 
again outpace local ad spending with national up 57 percent and 
local rising 31 percent 
until unemployment rates fall and the real estate and housing 
sectors turn around we must continue to be pessimistic about local 
ad growth next year coen said

tribune co will keep the new york daily news 
open as long as it continues regaining circulation and advertising 
lost in a 7weekold strike publisher james hoge said dec 14 
hoge speaking at the painewebber media conference said daily 
circulation has reached about 600000 after sinking as low as 
250000 it was more than 109 million before the strike 
the publisher has previously said the paper lost 115 million 
between 1979 and 1989 and that losses by the end of 1990 will rise 
to about 200 million 
hoges determination to keep the paper open echoed his 
statements earlier in the week after a meeting with the tribune 
board in chicago 
after the dec 11 meeting theodore kheel the striking unions 
legal adviser called the decision a form of sheer masochism 
the news has no hope of survival whatsoever in the absence of 
a settlement or sale he said the sooner the board realizes 
that the better everyone including the tribune co will be 
the news using managers replacements and employees transferred 
from other tribune co newspapers has continued to publish despite 
the 7weekold strike by 2100 employees 
hoge said the strike is costly but not as expensive as trying 
to run the paper with all the excess costs and contract abuses that 
we had in the old contract 
another part of the dispute moved into court dec 13 when two 
newsstand owners sued the drivers union saying it encouraged a 
campaign of violence to stop vendors from selling the paper 
the federal suit filed on behalf of the citys approximately 
12000 news vendors seeks more than 30 million in damages from 
the newspaper amp mail deliverers union of new york and its 
president michael alvino 
the daily news brought a similar racketeering lawsuit against 
the unions last month both suits detail allegations of attempted 
murder arson assault and vandalism and accuse the drivers 
union of a long history of racketeering 
while the latest lawsuit was being filed negotiators for both 
sides met separately in washington with the director of the federal 
mediation and conciliation service but he reported virtually no 
progress toward ending the dispute 
its been a moving day but bottom line no theyre still 
quite separated said bernard e delury 
he and other federal mediators shuttled between the two sides 
for about seven hours in an effort to spur direct talks but the 
only hopeful result was that each agreed to be recalled by him 
hoge later called for the appointment of a federal mediator to 
force both sides toward a settlement 
what we are in favor of is a very highpowered supermediator 
to come in and knock everybodys heads together he said dec 
16 on a local television news program 
on the same show newspaper guild president barry lipton said 
were willing to consider anything that will bring about a fair 
and equitable settlement 
hoge and lipton both rejected binding arbitration

a letter to employees that their union dues would triple for some 
workers by 1993 and that only 45 percent of the cwas members were 
publishing employees

the supreme court has agreed to decide whether 
news media organizations enjoy any constitutional protection 
against being sued over broken promises of confidentiality 
the justices said dec 10 they will consider reinstating a 
200000 award against minnesotas two largest newspapers won by a 
news source whose identity was not kept confidential the award had 
been thrown out by the minnesota supreme court 
public relations man dan cohen initially won a 700000 award 
against the star tribune of minneapolisst paul and the saint paul 
pioneer press dispatch 
a state appeals court ruled that a promise of confidentiality 
given to cohen by a reporter with each newspaper amounted to an 
oral contract but cut the award to 200000 cohens victory was 
overturned completely by the state supreme court last july 
elliot rothenberg cohens attorney expressed pleasure at the 
us supreme courts decision to take up the case the major 
issue will be to what extent does the first amendment of the 
constitution apply to contract law he said does it give 
newspapers the right to dishonor promises or violate oral 
contracts with confidential sources 
attorneys for the newspapers said they had not seen the courts 
order and could not immediately comment on it 
the controversy stems from a revelation during the 1982 
minnesota political campaign that marlene johnson a democratic 
farm labor candidate for lieutenant governor once had been 
arrested and charged with shoplifting 
cohen who was associated with the campaign of wheelock whitney 
the independentrepublican candidate for governor provided the 
information on the condition he not be identified as the source 
reporters for the two papers gave that assurance but their 
editors ordered that cohens name be published because they said 
the public should be told that the information came from someone 
linked to whitneys campaign 
the same day he was named as the source in the newspaper stories 
about johnson cohen was fired from his advertising agency job 
in voting 42 to throw out cohens ensuing lawsuit against the 
newspapers the state supreme court drew a distinction between 
moral and legal obligations it said promises of confidentiality 
did not amount to oral contracts 
to impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an 
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship the 
state court said 
the state court also rejected arguments that cohen was entitled 
to collect monetary damages under a more general legal theory 
governing broken promises 
enforcement of the promise of confidentiality under such a 
theory would violate defendants first amendment rights the 
state court said 
minnesotas highest court added there may be instances where 
a confidential source would be entitled to a remedy when the 
states interest in enforcing the promise to the source outweighs 
first amendment considerations but this is not such a case 
the two dissenting state court justices called the ruling a 
sad day in the history of a responsible press in america 
in the appeal acted on dec 10 lawyers for cohen argued this 
court has not before accorded media organizations a constitutional 
privilege to break promises or contracts with others or to be 
immune from generally applicable laws no one including the news 
media should be above the law 
lawyers for the two newspapers urged the justices to reject 
cohens appeal

drafting a policy on the matter

the citys board of supervisors has given 
initial approval to what could become the nations only law 
regulating video display terminals in the workplace 
the measure tentatively approved dec 10 would require employers 
with 15 or more employees to provide adjustable work stations 
mandatory 15minute breaks and safety education for workers 
private and government offices would have two years to comply 
with the vdt safety rules if the ordinance is approved a second 
time by the supervisors and signed by mayor art agnos a second 
hearing was scheduled for dec 17 
this is the new age of safety and health legislation said 
supervisor nancy walker 
she compared the vdt safety ordinance to landmark laws at the 
turn of the century that set work standards such as eighthour days 
and compensation for overtime 
we are once again on the cutting edge of something that others 
have been unable to do she added and were taking heat from 
that 
the only other such ordinance in suffolk county ny was 
successfully challenged by business owners who said only the state 
could impose such rules 
the san francisco ordinance passed 81 supervisor tom hsieh 
cast the lone dissenting vote saying it was too costly and more 
information on vdt problems should be gathered 
the national institute for occupational safety and health said 
vdt workers often suffer headaches general malaise eye strain and 
musculoskeletal problems caused by poor work station design that 
results in awkward hand head and limb positions 
under the ordinance vdt operators would get a 15minute break 
every two hours work stations would have to have proper artificial 
lighting and be out of direct sunlight adjustable swivel chairs 
and document holders must be provided computer terminals would 
have to have detachable keyboards and adjustable nonglare 
screens among other safety features 
additionally businesses would have to provide workers at their 
request with arm wrist and foot rests that aid in proper 
placement of limbs and joints while working on a vdt 
jim lazarus vice president of the san francisco chamber of 
commerce said the business group opposes the ordinance because it 
would cost too much to comply especially during an economic 
downturn 
city budget analysts estimate it would cost san francisco about 
16 million to retrofit vdt work stations private businesses 
would probably pay some 36 million to comply with the ordinance 
they said

the federal communications commission is 
proposing rules to give cities more authority over basic cable 
television rates 
cable systems already pay millions in franchising fees provide 
community access channels and make certain other public service 
commitments but critics claim cable systems have raised prices 
inordinately while providing poor service to subscribers 
the house in september adopted legislation that would have given 
the fcc power to regulate basic cable services but the measure 
stalled in the waning days of the congress and did not pass the 
senate 
the new proposals redefine what constitutes effective 
competition for a cable system the companies now can avoid rate 
regulation of their basic tier of service if they have 
effective competition which the fcc defines as three overtheair 
broadcast stations covering the cable systems community 
the new rules would raise that number of competing stations 
required effectively bringing many more cable systems under rate 
regulation 
following a period of public comment the fcc will adopt final 
rules sometime next year

belgium has brought back mr energy and japan even 
asks its citizens to take smaller baths with the persian gulf 
confrontation as a reminder affluent nations are conserving oil 
once again 
a decade after europes last oil crisis belgium is reviving 
heat limits in public buildings designating in each a monsieur 
energie employee to watch the thermostat 
italy has announced measures ranging from mandatory tire 
pressure checks to nuclear energy research 
a new spirit of conservation is emerging in western europe and 
japan as the gulf crisis drives home the risks of heavy dependence 
on foreign oil 
theres a lot of encouragement going around theres the 
feeling that oil demand has to be curbed said peter bogin 
assistant director for oil markets at cambridge energy research 
associates in paris 
whats important is that thats a feeling that hasnt existed 
for the past five years 
western europe and japan generally have not suffered severely 
from the rise in oil that followed the iraqi seizure of kuwait on 
aug 2 
their economies have generally had higher growth than the us 
economy the dollar the currency in which oil prices are set is 
relatively cheap and world oil supplies have remained fairly 
constant 
what the crisis has done is jar rich nations into realizing 
their risk if war breaks out and many are trying to curb their 
thirst for oil 
in italy the government has decided to tighten enforcement of 
speed limits and pay 30 percent of energysaving investments in 
homes or industries it plans to invest in nuclear power research 
and spend 27 billion on extending bus and subway networks 
japan has urged its people to drive slower keep building 
thermostats at 68 degrees and curtail the schedules of 24hour 
stores and tv stations 
companies and individuals in france are allowed to write off 100 
percent of energysaving investments 
the measures are new versions of those introduced in the early 
1970s when the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
quadrupled oil prices 
that oil shock and another in 197980 forced draconian 
measures in oildependent europe 
some governments banned sunday driving or forced restaurants to 
close early street and store lights were dimmed and customers 
sometimes shopped by candlelight 
europe now sees the results of its investments in alternative 
energy france for example gets more than 80 percent of its 
electricity from nuclear plants norway exports electricity from 
its hydroelectric plants 
even so cheap petroleum and good economic times have encouraged 
europeans and japanese in recent years to increase their use of oil 
and buy bigger cars 
people thought energy was cheap and would stay cheap 
forgetting that all the conditions for instability were there 
said joao vale de almeida energy spokesman for the european 
community you only needed someone to pull the trigger which mr 
saddam did 
according to the international energy agency imported oil 
accounts for 188 percent of primary energy needs in the united 
states 306 percent in western europe and 59 percent in japan 
twothirds of japans oil comes from the persian gulf 
many developed countries are drawing up emergency energy plans 
greece is printing gasoline rationing coupons in case of war in 
the gulf the netherlands may bring back sunday driving bans and 
gas rationing if supplies decline 
every country is envisaging tougher measures said nobuyashi 
yokoe director of the emergency systems division at the 
international energy agency in paris 
the european community has proposed a longterm conservation 
program and new taxes on oil and coal 
as vale de almeida put it the question now is even when the 
crisis is solved what should we do in order to avoid falling into 
the same kind of situation in the future 
in italy which gets 58 percent of its energy from oil 
electricity rates are going up and the government has reversed its 
antinuclear policy launching a 500 million research project 
officials say the government will maintain the high price of 
gasoline now 530 a gallon even if oil prices fall 
italian authorities hope high costs will restrain a motormad 
population france sweden and some other countries have reported 
lower demand for gasoline 
oil analyst bogin said a longterm change in driving habits is 
unlikely in europe where gasoline already is heavily taxed 
because theyre used to paying such outrageous prices

benazir bhutto says she is ready to 
do battle with the political and legal troubles that accompanied 
her dismissal as prime minister 
after her election defeat in october opponents and some 
supporters predicted she would move to britain or the united states 
and try to rebuild a career shattered by charges of corruption 
misconduct and incompetence 
in her autobiography daughter of the east ms bhutto wrote 
of the griefstricken young woman who went into exile after her 
father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto was overthrown and 
hanged years later she returned triumphantly and became the first 
woman to lead a modern moslem nation 
this time the 37yearold former prime minister says shell 
fight on her home turf 
i have no desire to live abroad she said in an interview 
i want to live in my own country come what may 
i certainly plan to go abroad not once but several times a 
year but i certainly dont intend to go into exile i denied it 
and yet stories are fed to the press that im planning to go abroad 
and bargaining for the release of my husband 
asif ali zardari a flamboyant businessman who became ms 
bhuttos husband in a december 1987 wedding arranged by her mother 
has been blamed for the political downfall of his wife and her 
pakistan peoples party 
zardari a 38yearold member of parliament has been jailed in 
karachi since early october for alleged involvement in the 
kidnapping and extortion of a british businessman he has yet to be 
formally charged and has been denied bail twice 
associates say the emotional strain of her husbands confinement 
has taken a toll on ms bhutto they have a 2yearold son and an 
11monthold daughter 
if her record of the past decade is an indication ms bhutto 
will confront her detractors rather than leave politics 
with her family life at stake and proposed legislation to make 
death by hanging the penalty for kidnapping however western 
diplomats and some associates say ms bhuttos priority is getting 
zardari released 
i am not bargaining for the release of my husband she said 
in the interview my husband is an innocent person he is in jail 
because he happens to be my husband he is seen as a convenient 
weapon by which to blackmail and pressure me 
i proposed to him in august that he should go abroad because 
they were bound to imprison him but he refused he has always 
tried to cheer me up and says dont worry of course im 
worried but being worried doesnt mean you change your commitment 
i was also worried when my father was in jail but it doesnt mean 
that you can be intimidated 
when she is not attending her husbands court hearings ms 
bhutto is trying to rally party workers and going over the events 
that prompted president ghulam ishaq khan to dismiss her government 
aug 6 after only 20 months 
three months after the dismissal came a humilitating defeat in 
the elections she still contends the vote was rigged but gets 
little support for the view from independent observers 
there has been a lot of time for reflection she said 
certainly one has reflected to a great degree on the past and 
how things could have been done differently although the nagging 
feeling remains that even if things were done differently the 
hostility and bias on the side of the president was so great that 
it would still come out the same 
he did not give us a chance to govern and i believe that he 
will not give a chance to the new government to function i was an 
outsider but even new prime minister nawaz sharif who is 
considered a blueeyed boy of the establishment is not being given 
a chance to rule even the cabinet was imposed on him by the 
president 
ms bhutto faces eight charges of misconduct and abuse of power 
filed with special corruption tribunals many observers supporters 
and critics believe she will be convicted and barred from politics 
for as long as seven years 
if that happens the 39 other pakistan peoples party members of 
the 217seat national assembly will resign they have given their 
letters of resignation to ms bhutto 
it is up to the government to decide whether it wants the 
fulcrum of the opposition inside the parliament or outside it 
she said 
if they think they can silence the voice of the people by 
disqualifying the leader of the opposition then fine parliament 
will have no legitimacy and if the parliament has no legitimacy 
then the government will also have no legitimacy 
many diplomats and associates say ms bhutto is too preoccupied 
with legal problems both her own and those of her husband to be 
the strong opposition leader pakistan needs 
they contend she still has not learned from her mistakes come 
to grips with election defeat or been able to galvanize the 
pakistan peoples party once pakistans most progressive political 
force 
ms bhutto denies all that and says she will fight for electoral 
reform human rights and helping democracy take root in a country 
that has spent more than half its 43 years under military rule 
as i have seen in my life changes do come about she said 
what is important is to keep your commitment and fight for 
principles 
i have passed through many difficult periods and this is 
not the worst time for me

the first wellwishing letters 
arrived days before her birthday and so did a birthday present a 
collection of albums prepared by a friend who went through seven 
suitcases full of critiques that had been sort of dumped into the 
basement 
elisabeth schwarzkopf who turned 75 on dec 9 seems to have 
lost little of the temperament she showed as elvira in mozarts 
don giovanni it was one of the sopranos operatic parts that 
won her international acclaim as did her lieder recitals 
despite a recent bout with flu her voice was strong and clear 
as she recalled some highlights of a career that spanned four 
decades of performing which she is continuing as a teacher of 
young talent 
she spoke in a rare interview at her home near zurich records 
and music books lined a wall in her living room a large unframed 
photograph on the mantelpiece showed her as a stunningly beautiful 
countess in richard strauss capriccio 
i did not want to teach at all she said but i think i 
owe it to all those who helped me in my life to pass on what i know 
will be asked from these young artists later on in life 
teaching she said allows her to use her most important asset 
analyzing a singer 
as a teenager a wrong analysis by her first teacher nearly 
thwarted her ambitions she thought i was a contralto 
schwarzkopf said i was only too pleased because i loved that 
kind of very dark sounding singing but it would have ruined my 
voice her mother who had a very critical ear finally made her 
change teachers 
her operatic debut came in 1938 at berlins opernhaus as a 
flower maiden i learned overnight she recalled in rapid 
fluent english 
schwarzkopf attracted the attention of maria ivoguen a famous 
hungarian soprano who gave her private lessons ivoguen added a 
new dimension to the young protegees voice by teaching her to sing 
lieder 
tuberculosis forced her to rest for a year when she was rising 
to fame in her native germany in world war ii but the illness also 
let her escape the most devastating allied bombing attacks on 
berlin 
i kept my music in the air raid shelter so i could also learn 
during the alerts she said 
following recovery in 1944 she could sing only a few weeks of a 
new engagement at viennas state opera before the curtain fell on 
all stages because of allied bombings 
the postwar period began in a lovely room on top of a chicken 
ranch on austrias lake atter she recalled american care 
parcels were her pay for entertaining gis at a nearby hospital she 
said as she hummed gershwins summertime in recollection 
her reputation grew rapidly throughout europe with salzburg 
bayreuth and milans la scala among early milestones 
she showed that the human voice can be as much an instrument 
of phrasing as the violin wrote an enthralled critic after 
schwarzkopfs first appearance in londons covent garden in 1947 
with the vienna state opra company 
her us debut came in 1953 after her marriage to walter legge 
artistic director of a major british recording company it was 
limited to one recital evening in the packed new york town hall and 
drew resounding applause from audience and critics 
she had become an international star with conductors including 
wilhelm furtwaengler george szell otto klemperer karl boehm and 
herbert von karajan 
boehm was the easiest to work with she said with von karajan 
in the later years it was more difficult because he was changing 
the rehearsed tempi every time and wow if you didnt constantly 
look at him 
she vividly described a visit to the home of aging arturo 
toscanini when the maestro complained about the slow tempi german 
conductors used in magic flute especially for paminas aria 
he started conducting it immediately with his forefingers 
schwarzkopf recalled and he said sing sing paminas aria it 
was much faster than we ever heard it before but i went along and 
then he said this is how it should be done you see 
she named the marschallin in richard strauss der 
rosenkavalier and fiordiligi in mozarts cosi fan tutte as 
some of her favorite parts along with the countess in 
capriccio 
i was always horrified at the two arias of the countess but if 
a singer isnt horrified it wont be good she said 
she bade farewell to the stage in 1971 in brussels belgium 
with der rosenkavalier but she continued singing lieder where 
many critics considered her peerless her recitals of wolf 
schubert bach and others continued to attract audiences until her 
last appearance in zurich in 1979 three days before her husband 
died 
schwarzkopf is concerned about what she feels is a lack of 
knowledge about classical music among many young people many 
have the gift of musicality but they are never exposed to it 
she said 
leonard bernstein did it with those concerts for children he 
did a great great service to music i wish it were done in all 
places where there is an orchestra i know that if young people 
ever get exposed to it once they would know that are other realms 
of beauty than the disco

if paul hogan has a personality he must remove 
it prior to giving interviews and stow it in a dark closet 
because even though hogans life story should evoke fascinating 
discussion 30 minutes with the movie star is about as exciting as 
spending an afternoon going over premiums with an insurance 
salesman 
the life and times of paul hogan are so extraordinary that they 
sound more like a highconcept screenplay its the story of a 
construction worker who left school at 14 and entered show business 
relatively late in life on a lark and a lot of chutzpah 
but extracting the story from hogan who sat for a recent 
interview to plug his latest movie almost an angel was no 
easy task hogan rationed smiles and anecdotes as if they were 
coupons for gas and butter during world war ii 
when he was a 31yearold outrigger and father of five working 
on the sydney harbour bridge he contacted an australian tv show 
not unlike the now defunct gong show in the united states it 
was an amateur talent show called new faces in which 
contestants were often ridiculed by a panel of judges 
hogan decided to turn the tables on the judges to that end he 
portrayed himself as a knifethrowing tap dancer from the 
australian outback the shows producers believed him and booked 
him on the show 
they were looking for new talent but they were often very 
cruel said hogan i thought itd be nice to give them a dose 
of their own medicine i didnt have any other ambitions at all 
hogan went on the show live and proceeded to needle and 
insult each of the judges the way they normally did the 
contestants 
switchboards lit up and a star was born 
but it was a reluctant star hogan says he never had any 
interest in show business as a career and returned to work on the 
bridge the next day he even turned down an offer to return to the 
show but changed his mind when they offered him money 
i never took it seriously said hogan who is now 50 i 
never thought it would last 
more appearances on the show followed hogan graduated to spots 
on other shows and was given his own the paul hogan show was 
eventually syndicated all over the world and made hoges one of 
australias top stars 
his commercials in the united states for australian tourism in 
which he greeted the audience with a gday mate and offered to 
throw a shrimp on the barbie paved the way for the 
overwhelming success of his two crocodile dundee films 
though he never went through high school he wrote the majority 
of sketches on his australian show and wrote and produced the two 
dundee films 
all in all he sounds like a helluva guy the kind of fellow who 
could drink you under the table at some tough sydney pub and keep 
you in stitches 
guess again 
seated in an elegant suite at the plaza hotel where his 
character stayed in crocodile dundee hogan appeared 
surprisingly small he wore a simple shirt jeans and cowboy boots 
his manner was serious and fairly grim 
hogan had decreed that no photographer be present so as not to 
interrupt the flow of the interview in fact a few flashbulbs 
might have livened up things 
he did allow that hes enjoyed his last 18 years in show 
business and says he has no idea what would have happened had he 
not followed his impulse and appeared on new faces 
job satisfaction is the most important thing said hogan 
up until i was 30 i worked just to stay alive 
his second wife linda kozlowski 34 who costarred with him on 
both crocodile dundee movies and almost an angel was out 
christmas shopping on fifth avenue during the interview 
hogan divorced his wife of more than 25 years to marry 
kozlowski they split their time between a home in bangalore in new 
south wales and a rented home in los angeles 
though hogan said the supermarket tabloids played up his divorce 
and remarriage he complained only that if you have a private 
life you find yourself judged 
these days he said the tabloids seemed to have grown bored 
with him 
hard to understand why

while it wont happen president bush has said 
hed welcome a special session of congress called by its democratic 
leaders to strongly endorse what im doing in the confrontation 
with iraq 
vice president dan quayle adds that if congress isnt going to 
do that it ought to keep quiet 
john h sununu the white house chief of staff said most 
members of the house and senate want to state their opinions on 
persian gulf policy but dont want to have to cast an upordown 
vote on it 
with messages like those the republican administration is 
sharpening the political line on persian gulf policy disputing its 
critics and trying to prevent democrats from positioning themselves 
as the peace party 
its not a party line issue nor is there significant dissent on 
the us objective of getting iraq out of kuwait there are 
differences on tactics and especially on timing whether to wait 
while economic sanctions punish iraq or send troops to liberate 
kuwait after jan 15 the united nations deadline for withdrawal 
bush has made the latter offensive action course one of his 
options an array of democratic leaders in and out of congress 
prefers to wait longer for the sanctions to work 
in a white houseapproved speech quayle accused congressional 
democrats of playing politics with the persian gulf in senate 
hearings that offer the luxury of criticism without the burden of 
accountability 
he complained about the sequence of witnesses with critics 
appearing before administration officials testified although that 
happened because the white house chose not to send its spokesmen 
until after the united nations had voted to authorize the use of 
force against iraq 
quayle said the committees should have waited if there was 
such an urgency to have the hearings why not have an urgency to 
help the president he said 
bush said friday that he thinks he has increasing support in 
congress he noted that hed told house and senate leaders that 
if you want to come in here and strongly endorse what i am doing 
or endorse the united nations resolution i welcome that because i 
think it would send a very strong clear signal to the world 
sununu had said earlier that i have the feeling that most of 
them wish that they never get asked to make a decision one way or 
the other on the issue the new congress that convenes next month 
will have to vote on appropriations to pay for the desert shield 
operation 
quayle addressing republican governors in pinehurst nc last 
week said an expression of solid congressional backing for bush 
would improve the chances for peace 
but that would require congress to resist the temptation to 
use the current hearings on the gulf for partisan political 
advantage quayle said instead he said some congressional 
democrats are trying to portray themselves as the party of peace 
and the administration as the party of war 
he wouldnt say which congressional democrats im not getting 
into names at all quayle said later when he was asked to 
identify his targets im not going to do that and youre not 
going to bait me into it 
short of a resolution of support quayle said congress can be 
helpful by remaining silent were going to interpret their 
silence as being supportive 
two days later when the senate foreign relations committee 
resumed its hearings on the persian gulf sen joseph r biden jr 
ddel said the purpose was to broaden understanding of the crisis 
and ways to resolve it not to score political points 
the administration has responded by accusing this and other 
congressional committees of partisanship biden said we are 
accused of seeking to break the bush presidency he said that 
isnt so 
makeorbreak issues will be shaped by the outcome in the 
persian gulf not by congressional hearings or political debate 
if we win a relatively quick and decisive victory as is very 
likely i think the president will emerge as the hero said 
rep stephen j solarz a new york democrat who supports his 
current course if we were to get bogged down in a protracted 
conflict with the casualties building up the country would 
obviously come to a different conclusion

once upon a time in the nottoodistant past 
life as a television viewer was relatively simple 
fall marked the beginning of a new television season reruns 
were over the kids trudged back to school clocks fell back an 
hour for the end of daylightsaving time and tv guide published its 
annual fall preview edition 
there was a certain lifesustaining order to all this 
now however there is no certainty chaos reigns in the world 
of network programming there no longer is just one season for new 
shows there are at least three and the second one is upon us 
officially known as the midseason it unofficially stretches 
from january to may with the third season being summer a mixture 
of reruns and leftover pilots 
being a midseason show is a little like enlisting in the armed 
forces reserves during wartime being sent to the front is a 
distinct possibility so is getting killed 
but as the ratings war escalates between networks fighting for 
the biggest share of a dwindling audience the midseason no longer 
functions simply as a back bench 
yes midseason shows still are used to replace fall failures 
but more and more they exist in and of themselves and form a 
separate season altogether 
no network has embraced this concept more wholeheartedly than 
abc it enters the new year with 12 midseason shows nearly twice 
the number of each of its competitors 
abc entertainment president robert iger has unabashedly held 
back shows from the fall lineup to unveil them after jan 1 most 
notoriously twin peaks the muchhyped soap opera masterminded 
by david lynch debuted last april 8 smack in the middle of 
midseason 
abc cbs and nbc have had varying degrees of success with 
midseason shows for abc moonlighting coach americas 
funniest home videos and the wonder years all proved big 
hits 
nbc scored well with in the heat of the night quantum 
leap carol amp co and hill street blues 
at cbs all in the family debuted as a midseason program 
other notables include top cops northern exposure and 
doctor doctor 
by deliberately waiting for the fall hoopla to die down and for 
fall failures to manifest themselves abc thinks it can grab more 
viewers 
were the ones who figured it out emphasized it and bought 
shows specifically for it said ted harbert abcs executive 
vice president of prime time 
we did not participate in the fall chaos we put on the lowest 
number of fall of shows five harbert said in the long run 
i think that is going to turn out to be the right thing to do 
this fall season was indeed chaotic with nearly 100 shows on 
the four networks 34 of them new it was largest fall rollout in 
television history 
and although cbs and nbc have their own stables of midseason 
shows their executives espouse a different philosophy about the 
significance of januarytomay programming 
the time for new shows will always be the fall said nbc 
entertainment president warren littlefield thats when we can 
take a long time to promote them and to create some excitement out 
there you want to reinforce that tradition not break it down 
nbc used the fall schedule as an opportunity to bolster its 
toprated status by revamping its aging lineup we put on nine 
new shows which is probably the most aggressive schedule ever for 
a no 1 network littlefield said 
five have already been canceled littlefield likened the fallout 
to running a relay race in the middle you want to be able to 
kick in with a fresh runner and in the summer you want to end 
strong 
cbs the bottomrated network introduced the highest number of 
new fall shows of the 12 it debuted half have been canceled like 
nbc it has seven midseason shows some of which are still in 
development and some of which are already on the prime time 
schedule 
peter tortorici senior vice president of program planning for 
cbs said the notion of midseason programming is really nothing 
new 
weve come up with new labels and new names but essentially 
were doing the same thing that weve always done tortorici 
said what has changed is the volume 
the midseason is a necessity tortorici said the practical 
reality is that most shows wont make it the reason for a 
midseason is for that overpowering reason

two of the somber realities of economic life 
recession and high healthcare costs are coming together at just 
the wrong time for many businesses and employees 
consulting firms are recommending that companies scrutinize 
their plans for savings but the historical evidence shows that 
insecurity and other stresses of economic downturns produce greater 
demands on the plans 
for a variety of reasons healthcare utilization and lean 
times go hand in hand says anna rappaport an officer of william 
m mercer inc a leading employee benefits and human resources 
consulting firm 
even layoffs inevitable in a recession can have an impact on 
the cost of health coverage since the consolidated ominibus budget 
act of 1985 requires employers to offer continued coverage to 
terminated workers 
healthcare managers believe some of those former employees may 
use their time to attend to nagging ailments or to undergo surgery 
they had postponed or that financial stress could produce costly 
physical and mental problems 
while the omnibus act popularly and perhaps aptly known as 
cobra in some circles allows employers to charge terminated 
employees the full cost of continued coverage the companies still 
could end up with higher costs 
ms rappaport explains that employees who continue coverage 
often are those most in need typically she says that need might 
involve someone in the family with a mental or physical ailment 
with the result that their coverage costs more than the company is 
allowed to charge the former worker 
still another recessioninduced problem puts pressure on company 
benefit plans older workers and those with chronic ailments may 
seek protection from termination by opting for early retirement or 
by filing a disability claim 
consultants at mercer which serves 9000 domestic employers 
and more if its international operations are included are urging 
clients to reexamine their plans and prepare for the worst but to 
avoid kneejerk solutions 
based on past experience one of the more serious blunders may 
be to slash benefits at the expense of morale and productivity ms 
rappaport a mercer managing director claims that to do so can 
send all the wrong signals 
instead she recommends that companies seek to preserve the 
overall value of benefits and that if it is necessary to shift 
costs to employees then it is also wise to balance this with a 
lowcost addition to the plan 
healthcare costs have been a worsening problem for more than 
two decades consistently rising faster than inflation in general 
by some estimates health care now accounts for about 17 percent of 
gross national product 
at the same time recipients providers insurers employers and 
others agree that much cost is associated with correctible personal 
habits waste duplication and needless usage such as overly long 
hospital stays 
one of the most disturbing consequences of efforts to correct 
any one of these however has been to see costs rise in another 
area savings were sought for example by avoiding or limiting 
hospital stays and it worked for a time but outofhospital costs 
then rose and negated some of those efforts 
in view of such experiences ms rappaport believes there is 
no clean neat solution instead she says the problem must be 
attacked in whatever new ways it rears its ugly head there are 
tradeoffs but not solutions

china is huge and ancient a place of mystery 
and fascination to westerners chinas special ways touch a 
westerners daily life as the writer discovered when she was 
assigned this fall to the associated press bureau in beijing

the driver wove through congested traffic veered 
around muledrawn wagons and passed with cabbageladen trucks that 
dated from world war ii 
a woman carrying a large basket of produce stepped directly in 
front of the car the driver braked swerved blasted the horn the 
woman stared as we passed her bicycles crisscrossing in our wake 
i had just arrived to take up residence in beijing and made a 
mental note that a drive across town should not be approached 
lightly 
there is much for an outsider to learn in the worlds most 
populous country from its ancient past to its complex modern 
politics 
it remains unique despite increased contact with the outside 
and entices the curious to explore 
villagers welcome foreigners warmly giving directions to the 
most scenic spots nearby sometimes even inviting them home for a 
meal on a long train ride chinese travelers will chat at length 
with outsiders over tea 
in china evem the ordinary can be exotic sometimes after a 
wind storm from the north it seems as if half the gobi desert has 
been deposited on the floors furniture and windowsills of a 
beijing apartment 
beijing is heated by coal and its air is thick with the residue 
you can tell how long someone has been in the capital it is said 
by the severity and frequency of the persons cough 
a newcomer must apply for a health certificate those who are 
prepared bring letters from doctors back home chest xrays and 
copies of laboratory reports certifying they have no communicable 
diseases 
getting chinese officials to accept the papers is the challenge 
the canny applicant places a chop or official stamp on every 
piece of paper to lend an air of authority 
after some wrangling the hospital official agreed to accept my 
xray more discussion was needed to avoid paying the xray fee 
even though no xray would be taken 
by this time a crowd had gathered to hear the discussion which 
alternated between chinese and english as each of us used whichever 
seemed best suited to the point at issue 
finally the health official had dropped all but one demand she 
insisted i have a blood test for syphilis 
a new york doctor had given me a letter saying i had no venereal 
diseases but the official declared syphilis is not a venereal 
disease 
i submitted to the test paid the fee and left wondering 
whether the entire process was designed just to collect foreign 
currency 
foreign exchange is in great demand and having it provides 
options but its all a bit confusing because the local currency 
comes in two varieties one for foreigners and one for chinese 
renminbi the nonconvertible currency used by chinese is 
officially unavailable to foreigners they are supposed to use 
foreign exchange certificates or fec 
when i went to make my first household purchase a kettle for 
boiling drinking water i had only fec and the price was in 
renminbi fec has a higher street value so i asked the clerk to 
lower the price 
onlookers clustered around for the bargaining some joined in 
helping me persuade the woman to offer a foreign money price 
so she asked for dollars no i was offering fec pretty soon 
she was quoting three prices renminbi fec or dollars 
much too complicated i thought so i left to think it over 
when i returned the next day all the kettles were gone 
part of the fun of bargaining is that when the bargainer is 
foreign it becomes instant street theater passersby love to 
watch and offer advice especially if the foreigner bargains in 
chinese 
the polite parting line is always you speak very good 
chinese however good or bad it may have been 
foreigners get used to stares on the street but official 
surveillance is another matter 
cameras record all comings and goings at the walled compounds 
where most foreigners must live there are more subtle reminders of 
probing eyes like tea stains on newspaper clippings from a friend 
in the united states who doesnt drink tea 
foreign reporters seem the most closely watched and the most 
resentful of it which creates a mutual animosity that isnt always 
hidden 
at foreign ministry briefings spokesmen often refuse to answer 
questions and rebuke those who demand answers reporters counter 
with derisive laughter 
a dutch journalist asked whether a new government campaign to 
improve chinas image would mean greater access to leaders and more 
complete answers to questions 
colleagues laughed anticipating an ironic or sarcastic reply 
no comment the spokeswoman said

when she first hit bestseller lists a dozen 
years ago with her steamy novel scruples judith krantz 
thought it was a fluke a magical midlife gift that would never 
come again 
i was in shock for two years she says of the book sales 
bonanza that set the publishing world on its ear i put one foot 
in front of another and did what a person does on a 16city book 
tour when you have a no 1 best seller but i didnt know what i 
was doing 
now launching her sixth book dazzle another in the 
sexandglamour sagas that have made her famous the acclaimed 
queen of escapist pop literature recalls her first overnight 
success as fondly as a first love affair 
she still wears the golden cuff bracelet from her husband 
producer steve krantz to commemorate the scruples publication 
it reminds her of that star burst of fame and fortune that sent her 
into orbit as a bestselling author 
and she who has since sold books and miniseries for millions 
still savors the memory of her first 50000 advance 
scruples was published two days after her 50th birthday and 
for this former freelance magazine writer and beverly hills wife 
and mother a new life had begun 
when she hit the bestseller list she ran out and impulsively 
bought a pair of diamond earrings i took refuge in the one thing 
i was sure of shopping it had never occurred to me there was 
money in this she says of her book writing 
and it had never occurred to her that she could make a major 
purchase without her husbands approval its one of the basic 
things most women cant do they cant write a big check without 
asking their husbands its very satisfying for a woman of my 
generation to write a check without asking anyone 
but there was life after scruples and krantz fearul of 
being swallowed by fames dizzying whirl retreated to her 
typewriter 
i started another book so i had a feeling of being grounded 
she said i started princess daisy as soon as possible it 
returned me to a routine of working 
she was still uncertain that success would last 
i never took for granted that i would write a second book and 
i never envisioned that one day you and i would be sitting here and 
i would have written six books she says over lunch in her 
bright flowered beverly hills home 
her second book made publishing history paperback rights were 
auctioned for 32 million then the highest price ever for reprint 
rights 
judith krantz was a millionaire in her own right she had a 
following her subsequent books mistrals daughter ill 
take manhattan and till we meet again were scooped up by 
faithful readers and by television 
but there was a downside to krantz success the critics snubbed 
her 
i took criticism in the press as someone snatching money out 
of the mouths of more deserving writers she recalls they 
didnt understand that if publishers make money on best sellers 
they can afford to work with other authors they had profits from 
my books that they could put into risk taking 
this onetime wellesly college english major knows she is not 
writing serious literature 
i think i write about things that are serious in the lives of 
my characters but not in a serious way my style is not a serious 
style its a playful styleshe says 
sex is a key ingredient in krantz books and dazzle contains 
more explicit sex scenes than ever including a lesbian episode 
why does she focus so heavily on sex 
i like to write about it she says matteroffactly i 
love to write erotic sensuous scenes i found i had a talent for 
writing about sex and i like to exercise that talent besides i 
dont feel i know my characters in a completely rounded way unless 
i know about their sex lives its like the color of their hair 
krantz prides herself on factual research for each book she 
explored the beverly hills boutique business in scruples the 
world of advertising agencies in princess daisy nazi 
collaborators in mistrals daughter and world war ii flying 
aces in till we meet again 
the heroine of dazzle is a beautiful photographer of 
celebrities who also is heir to an orange county calif spanish 
land grant threatened by development that subject is as carefully 
delineated as her characters wardrobes and sexual appetites 
you cant keep a novel going on just sex and clothes says 
krantz nobody would read it youve got to have real characters 
and real problems 
as dazzle hits the bookstores with a glitzy gold cover 
krantz is starting a new book she writes now she says for love 
not money and certainly not for posterity 
if i were writing for posterity as an english major i would 
have to laugh at myself she says i dont think ill come back 
in another life and see kids reading my books in high school

those cheerful green plants may be doing more 
than adding a touch of nature to your home or office some 
scientists think they are keeping you healthy by eating hazardous 
indoor air pollution 
wc wolverton a retired nasa researcher who now has his own 
lab in picayune miss said potted plants are amazingly efficient 
at eliminating such pollutant gases as formaldehyde benzene and 
trichloroethylene from the air 
i think we are closing in on the real economic solution to the 
indoor air pollution problem wolverton said in a telephone 
interview 
the nations florists and nurserymen are enthusiastic of 
course the associated landscape contractors of america has set up 
the foliage for clean air council to promote and publicize studies 
by wolverton and others 
a mississippi businessman wayne anderson established a company 
to market wolvertons invention natures filter which uses a 
fan to draw air through a plants root system apparently 
accelerating the pollutioneating effect 
weve done a lot of testing on it and it looks really good 
anderson said his alliance research and manufacturing corp plans 
to sell the plantbased filter through interior landscapers for 
130 
wolverton an environmental engineer said his studies show the 
fanaided plant filter can do the job of 100 normal plants in 
cleaning up gases given off by paints and varnishes particle board 
or synthetic carpet fibers or contained in tobacco smoke 
his work has focused on benzene formaldehyde and 
trichloroethylene all compounds found commonly in homes and 
offices and known to cause irritation and illness and possibly 
cancer he has used dwarf azaleas golden pothos bamboo palms 
english ivy pot mums and other plants 
the research began as part of the national aeronautic and space 
administrations effort to plan for air filtration in future space 
habitats where humans would be living for years without any way to 
bring in fresh air 
not all experts in the field are sold on wolvertons findings 
im a wolverton skeptic said thad godish professor of 
natural resources at ball state university in muncie ind i 
think everybody should have plants in their houses but its highly 
improbably that theyll be useful for air cleaning 
godish published a study in 1988 critiquing some of wolvertons 
earlier research on spider plants and formaldehyde gas coming off 
particle board 
the small amount i saw just said theres no way in the world 
putting spider plants in the house is going to make a difference 
godish said 
wolverton said critics pointed out important gaps in his early 
studies but said his newest research answers any questions that 
have been raised 
our original work was limited he said those have been 
constructive criticisms 
wolverton said his most recent studies suggest that the 
cleansing process is more complicated than it first appeared 
at first we thought the plant leaves were doing all the 
work he said now we find the soil and microorganisms are 
major players 
there was some concern wolverton said that a plant exposed to 
nasty chemicals would absorb them for a while then just get 
sick and die and dump it back into the environment 
instead he said the plants seem to get better at filtering the 
pollutants the longer they are exposed 
as we keep exposing the plants they seem to absorb more and 
more rather than less and less he said 
a possible explanation he said is that the microorganisms in 
the potting soil adapt to the benzene formaldehyde or other 
chemicals they are exposed to and begin to thrive on them 
this is not surprising since it is a wellestablished fact 
that microorganisms have the ability to genetically adapt thereby 
increasing their ability to utilize toxic chemicals as a food 
source when continuously exposed to such chemicals wolverton 
wrote in a 1989 nasa study 
he said the people most likely to benefit from pollutioneating 
plants are those in energyefficient homes or offices tightly 
sealed to keep out cold air or in mobile homes usually made with 
materials that give off suspect gases 
plants wolverton said are probably the only economic 
solution to sealing these buildings for energy efficiency and to 
make them healthier

in the outer office of gene hunter 
francis collins at the university of michigan is a banner nf amp 
cf back to back another one down love the lab 
the nf and cf refer to collins labs identification of the 
genes that set the stage for two devastating diseases 
neurofibromatosis the socalled elephant mans disease and cystic 
fibrosis 
genetics is his lifes work collins says because it best lets 
him serve mankind and because its fun 
he is a mosiac of a man simultaneously living in the 
competitive and fastmoving world of genetics research and living 
for his family his church and his music 
collins the man of science reads christian novels to lull 
himself to sleep around midnight and then starts the day at 5 am 
by reading the bible 
in 1989 a team led by this tall lanky man with hair in an 
early beatlesstyle mop top tracked down the gene for cystic 
fibrosis a feat made possible in part by collins development of a 
new way of searching for the tiny bits of dna since the discovery 
of the cystic fibrosis gene his lab and others have corrected the 
errant gene in test tubes inserting healthy genes into defective 
cells 
last summer he found the neurofibromatosis gene tagging it at 
the same time as researcher ray white at the university of utah 
within months collins and white again working independently 
also found that the neurofibromatosis gene appears to work like a 
switch that can turn on cancer a find that could lead to new 
treatments for brain tumors or other cancers 
dr allan e rubinstein medical director of the national 
neurofibromatosis foundation called it the single most exciting 
discovery in neurogenetics that has ever taken place 
that discovery means were beginning to see the shape of 
things says dr sherm weissman the yale university professor 
under whom collins worked as a fellow in genetics from 1981 to 
1984 
some scientists might take a lifetime to develop a momentous 
find collins whose path to his calling was uneven has 
specialized in genetics for less than a decade 
science has a lot of competition people get jealous envious 
of people who do extremely well says thomas gelehrter chairman 
of human genetics at michigans medical school collins 
achievements havent aroused such resentment 
its the kind of person he is hes a warm human being other 
people enjoy his success says gelehrter who recruited collins 
from yale in 1984 
collins is a relentless researcher yet in the midst of the last 
frantic stage of the search for the cf gene this hunter with a 
hint of a southern drawl took a hiatus keeping his promise to 
spend three weeks as a missionary doctor in nigeria with his eldest 
daughter 
collins cf gene collaborator lapchee tsui of the hospital for 
sick children in toronto found in 1985 the first genetic marker 
that located which chromosome the gene was on they began 
collaborating in 1987 
collins frets over the past 18 months of publicity partly he 
fears that people with the two diseases will think the gene 
discoveries mean cures are around the corner he hopes to see cures 
in his lifetime 
he also worries that too much attention is focused on him 
its potentially dangerous because people think youre seeking 
it out im ready for it to calm down says collins trying to 
relax in an office crammed with books scientific journals and 
stacks of notebooks and files 
once a week he meets with graduate students and fellows working 
in teams on cystic fibrosis neurofibromatosis and three other 
projects the meetings are informal 
weve been playing around with these blots says one 
researcher at a recent meeting we need to go about this in a 
more organized manner says another collins listens patiently to 
the frustrations 
at another team meeting the weeks results rate high praise 
well you guys are hot collins squints down from his 6foot4 
height as he examines an associates lab results i think its 
cute he coos i hear gene therapy ringing out in the distance 
here 
later his young researchers amble in and out of his office with 
more results more ideas collins schedule gets more tangled this 
is why hes rarely on time for anything 
they need attention nurturing pats on the back its like 
having a small child you have to put time into it collins 
says 
its a philosophy reminiscent of his parents beliefs 
collins was born and raised in staunton va where fletcher and 
margaret collins settled to get away from the bustle of suburban 
long island and created their oak grove players theater 
long before there was any counterculture we went to live in 
the country theater and music and art thats a good blend says 
the elder mrs collins who writes and produces plays her husband 
quit his job as an airline executive to teach college theater 
francis the youngest of their four boys was reading by age 3 
he was obviously bright we wanted him to mix and mingle with 
people not be weird not to be arrogant about it mrs collins 
says

she schooled him at home until the fourthgrade when he could 
handle the drudgery of classrooms at 16 he graduated from 
robert e lee high school whose 1966 yearbook lists his career 
goal as aeronautical engineering 
by then he had met his future wife a meeting born of her need 
for a math tutor 
im shy but i was desperate mary lynn collins says with 
her sly good humor the couple discovered their mutual love of folk 
guitar and have been in love since 
they married in 1969 collins senior year at the university of 
virginia earning money by performing peter paul amp mary and joan 
baez tunes on weekends one resort offered them a free honeymoon if 
they played the weekend of their wedding they accepted 
were cheap mary lynn collins laughed in 1970 daughter 
margaret was born and the family headed to yale where collins 
received his doctorate in chemistry and a second daughter 
elizabeth was born we lived in a drug district off 250 a 
month i mowed lawns hed take down trees paint anything for 
money 
but a phd wasnt enough 
as a contribution to mankind it wasnt that great collins 
says so i went to medical school somewhat shook up and confused 
i wasnt sure if i wanted to continue in research or just be a 
doc 
at med school he discovered genetics then poised on the 
threshold of explosive discoveries it had everything i was 
looking for 
meanwhile mary lynn collins discovered christianity id been 
very depressed it was like a dynamo came into my life francis 
said he didnt want to hear about this jesus junk 
but his wifes suddenly bright outlook made him explore 
christianity i fought it and kicked and scratched collins 
says 
but little by little that became the guiding force in my 
life 
collins who now had a calling and a mission went back to yale 
yales weissman a professor of human genetics molecular 
physics biochemistry and medicine put collins to work developing 
a new way to find genes a technique now known as gene jumping 
were proud to have had him in the lab weissman said 
gene jumping is a technique for getting rid of parts of a 
chromosome that you dont want to waste time on unwanted lengths 
of the chromosome are literally cut away and the respective ends 
are then spliced together now parts of the chromosome that look 
promising are next to each other for easier gene hunting 
in ann arbor collins oversees four projects cystic fibrosis 
now experimenting with replacing defective genes with normal ones 
nf now mapping the finer points of the gene the search for the 
gene causing huntingtons disease and studying why the hemoglobin 
in fetuses changes to its adult version solving that puzzle could 
lead to treating sickle cell anemia 
also collins lab is one of four in the nation with a federal 
grant for the human genome project an effort to map every human 
gene collins directs the project here says director gelehrter 
who cowrote a genetics textbook with collins that was published 
this year 
collins typically puts in a 90hour workweek juggling up to 80 
phone calls a day guiding his projects examining patients and a 
whirlwind travel schedule that takes him to lecture appearances or 
to meetings of the halfdozen national research committees on which 
he serves 
we jokingly call him the northwest airlines professor 
gelehrter says adds mary lynn collins i dont know how he does 
it i keep warning him were 40 
husband and wife play their guitars at the new life baptist 
church on sunday theyre always providing something for 
someone says pastor jeff holt who believes his 2yearold 
congregation might not exist had the collinses not helped form it 
they were very instrumental in getting the church 
established holt says they provided a lot of essential 
leadership 
peter bellerman executive director of the national 
neurofibromatosis foundation credits collins with molding a 
consortium of genetic researchers who share data on the disfiguring 
disease that sharing speeded up finding the gene and its link to 
cancer he says 
while many researchers wont talk about their work until it is 
published he says in this group everybody is expected to put 
their cards on the table prepublication 
collins worries that his achievements will extract a price 
im dangerously close to being overcommitted he says he 
delegates work now but misses being behind the lab bench 
and he misses family time theyre very patient but my kids 
are growing up i dont want to sacrifice everything especially my 
family 
daughter margaret 20 is a student at the university of north 
carolina in chapel hill nc elizabeth 16 is a junior at an ann 
arbor high school 
it has taken a toll on our family in the last year and half 
says mrs collins weve really had to work on it but im a 
doctors daughter i know what it means 
can collins maintain his frenetic pace 
i may get to the point where i burn out he says maybe 10 
years from now i wont be at the cutting edge then what probably 
missionary medicine 
as a christian i lean toward it ive been blessed

people stare when peter dingeman walks into 
a room some show shock others turn away in pity or revulsion 
one time i was in a restaurant and someone came up to me and 
said how could you come in here and ruin my dinner i said no 
ones paying you to look 
dingeman a steel company employee has neurofibromatosis a 
genetic disorder best known erroneously as elephant mans 
disease about 100000 americans have nf making it about three 
times more common than the betterknown cystic fibrosis 
people with nf may develop benign tumors along the nerves of 
their arms and legs their eyes and sometimes their spinal cords or 
brains half will need surgery sometime in their lives as the 
disease progresses 
some people inherit nf in others its caused by a spontaneous 
mutation a gene gone awry some victims may have merely a few 
small lumps and patches of skin discoloration known as cafe au 
lait spots others may have learning disabilities scoliosis a 
spinal curvature other skeletal defects or tumors that disfigure 
every part of their body 
dingeman whose right eye is partly blocked by a tumor has nf 
because of a spontaneous mutation it used to make him angry 
you always had kids making fun of you he says i couldnt 
get dates my brother and two sisters were beautiful people i 
thought why me 
sometimes i get down in the dumps and still think that but 
for the most part i have no qualms and regrets i wouldnt trade 
with anyone adds dingeman 38 putting his arm around son josh 
6 and daughter sabrina 8 during an interview at their home 
northeast of detroit 
stares upset sabrina it bugs me i think keep your eyes off 
my dad 
dingemans peace with nf is such that he finds humor in it 
like in the grocery people will stare so hard they run the cart 
into the wall i just laugh 
dingeman was diagnosed at 16 when surgeons removing a cyst from 
his eye found a tumor instead since then hes undergone seven 
operations to take out growths around his eye the base of his 
skull and his elbow he faces more surgery it was after one 
operation that he met his wife a nurse after seven years of 
marriage they risked the 5050 odds of passing on the nf gene to 
children 
sabrina got lucky josh has signs of nf tan cafe au lait 
spots and a slightly enlarged head dingeman hopes that by the time 
josh must be told he has the disease therell be a treatment if 
not a cure 
a year ago he wouldnt have even fantasized about that but 
earlier this year drs francis collins of the university of 
michigan and ray white of the university of utah independently 
discovered the gene months later the researchers found that it 
appears to be in the family of genes that may operate as 
anticancer genes 
you can think of a cell as having a green light and a red 
light collins says when socalled tumorsuppressor genes are 
defective the cell stays in the greenlight state and keeps 
growing and pretty soon youve got a tumor 
findings suggest that nfs benign tumors may be an intermediate 
step between normal and cancerous tissue implications that could 
lead to new treatments for brain tumors and other cancers 
this often abused population as it turns out may hold the key 
for everybody elses cancer says peter bellerman executive 
director of the national neurofibromatosis foundation isnt 
there poetic or divine justice in this

editors note sometimes as they say you cant believe your 
eyes or your ears either as milli vanilli proved with modern 
technology the line between what is possible and what is 
considered permissible tends to blur 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
more than a century ago william s gilbert wrote 
the comicopera line that deserves repeating at the start of every 
year things are seldom what they seem skim milk masquerades as 
cream 
if the milli vanilli masquerade was not 1990s most blatant 
contribution to the worlds gallery of deception it at least 
showed that todays technology makes it all the more difficult to 
know when to call a knave a knave 
today we have example after example of artistry being 
enhanced as the technicians call it in undetectable ways as 
a result we do not always hear what we think we are hearing or see 
what we think we are seeing and the line tends to blur between the 
technically possible and the ethically permissible 
milli vanilli simply pushed enhancement beyond the pale and 
got caught which to some in the pop music business was its only 
crime 
what you saw in the milli vanilli act were two men dancing while 
singing or at least mouthing a song with a title rich in irony 
girl you know its true what you actually heard though were 
three not even two anonymous other people tape recorded in a 
studio doing the singing the recording crediting the dancers with 
the singing sold 7 million copies and milli vanilli won a grammy 
award rescinded when the truth came out 
given time the truth generally does fortunately because 
masquerades have a long history 
it took 41 years before piltdown man was exposed as a hoax that 
the bones of the missing link found in a gravel pit in england 
in 1912 were actually the skull of a man and the jaw of an ape for 
30 years new yorks metropolitan museum displayed three lifesize 
etruscan warriors believed until 1961 to date from the sixth 
century bc their actual sculptor was still alive in italy 
there is always someone who can tell the difference says 
john russell the chief art critic of the new york times now 
retired just as there is always someone who can tell at a glance 
what is wrong with a horse a plant a balance sheet 
maybe but gilbert knew what he was talking about when it came 
to masquerades and so did whoever said you cant tell a book by 
its cover 
literally one new york outfit among several has for 50 years 
found a ready market in fake books ritzy bindings with impressive 
titles go for 70 a foot installed serious nonreaders pay more 
for specific titles presumably books they especially dont want to 
read 
harmless enough but other masquerades are less so 
a few years ago sugar water masqueraded as apple juice and cost 
beechnut a 2 million fine on a single day in 1986 us customs 
seized truckloads of goods masquerading as genuine rolex piaget 
and cartier watches chanel and estee lauder perfume rayban 
sunglasses louis vuitton suitcases gucci handbags smart sam 
talking teddy bears the list goes on the haul was worth 10 
million retail which merely scratched the surface of a thoroughly 
businesslike and thoroughly fraudulent manufacturing operation 
the milli vanilli scam said william velez of new york 
university reflects an attitude that says why not everybodys 
doing it 
velez teaches a music and technology course which deals in part 
with the ethics of enhancement lipsyncing dubbing sampling 
pitchriding synthesizing the whole electronic garden of music 
wizardry 
you might say that enhancement is to music what anabolic 
steroids are to athletics though not detectable in urine samples 
and apparently permissible but where do you draw the line 
the industry has been moving for years toward more and more 
artificialness if you will so that it probably didnt seem so 
shocking for it to reach the milli vanilli stage velez said 
it bothers me that the students seemed generally cavalier about 
it maybe the outcry will shake them up 
in a television interview the milli vanilli producer frank 
farian seemed bewildered at the outcry he said he had heard the 
song had seen the dancers and put the two together in his mind 
in a flash of genius bingo a new art form 
but we will remember the name milli vanilli not for a new art 
form but for the same reason names such as janet cooke and rosie 
ruiz and clifford irving stick in the memory bank wouldbe 
achievers exposed as cheats no cheaters gain no fame only the 
lasting notoriety of getting caught 
and through the ages they seem to have relied less on fancy 
new technology than on plain old lying 
janet cooke simply made up her moving story about an 8yearold 
heroin addict which won a 1981 pulitzer prize clifford irving 
accepting a 750000 advance in 1971 said flat out that he had 
interviewed the reclusive howard hughes for an authorized 
autobiography the lie was all the more baldfaced because hughes 
was still alive to deny it which he did irving went to jail 
as for rosie ruiz she seemed to come out of nowhere as the 
sports pages said to win the 1980 boston marathon actually she 
came out of the crowd near the finish line in broad daylight and 
got found out 
the oldest fake on record in fact states without shame this 
is not a lie it is indeed the truth 
it is a cuneiform inscription on a stone marker now residing in 
the british museum it is a forgery apparently used in a 1500 bc 
babylonian land swindle it claims to be a thousand or so years 
older than it is in order to establish phony title and warns he 
who will damage this document let enki fill up his canals with 
slime

any museum worth its antiquities gallery also keeps a corner in 
the basement for its accumulated fakes 
every collector has bought a fake says richard fazzini 
head of antiquities at the brooklyn museum which has about 40 
sothebys the new york auction house estimates that as many as 
half the antiquities brought in for possible sale are forgeries 
the 250yearold british museum has so many bogus artifacts 
about 600 that it puts on fakes displays from time to time one of 
them stands as testimony that if a fake lasts long enough the 
cuckoo as it were will finally imitate the clock 
it is a marble bust of julius caesar cherished as genuine for 
143 years until exposed in 1961 by advanced dating methods it 
generated thousands of reproductions which still decorate 
libraries around the world and photographs to illustrate texts of 
gallic campaigns that inspired generations of high school latin 
students 
does it matter william shakespeare and francis bacon are both 
long dead does it really matter if as some claim bacon wrote 
some of the plays would their genius be diminished does the 
knowledge that dresden china is actually made in meissen make it 
any less lovely 
after all says wendy steiner professor of english at the 
university of pennsylvania if geoffrey of monmouth had not 
concocted his history of the kings of britain from a mysteriously 
vanished source we would not have had the morte darthur or 
king lear 
politicians all the way to the top accept the credit that 
belongs to their speechwriters todays public seems to accept that 
with the same shrug that they accept teleprompters which allow 
politicians to appear not to be reading what they appear to have 
written 
but tangible fakes however skillfully done have about the same 
intrinsic worth as a counterfeit relic of a saint who would settle 
for an exact copy of a family heirloom even a technically improved 
copy 
one of modern historys most accomplished fakers was han van 
meegeren of holland he specialized in forging paintings attributed 
to the 17th centurys jan vermeer and fooled some of the finest 
scholars on two continents some of them when van meegeren 
confessed were so embarrassed they refused to believe him 
when british forger tom keating on the other hand confessed in 
1976 to have forged about 2000 paintings by 100 different artists 
he was not scorned but celebrated he gave tv lectures on great 
artists techniques wrote his life story and became a folk hero 
fakery tends to fluctuate with the caprice of an artists 
popularity in the market at one point the lament among dealers was 
that the french painter camille corot who died in 1875 had 
painted about 800 pictures in his lifetime of which about 4000 
hung in american collections 
just as there is a market for fake books there also is a market 
for fake paintings authentic fakes if you will 
leo stevenson a 31yearold briton is a copier by profession 
he says he has made such a fine art of forging fine art that 
driven by honesty he always leaves a clue an xray of one of his 
vermeer forgeries for example will show a telephone in the 
background and a 17th century dutch girl wearing 20th century 
underwear 
no xray or chemical analysis though will detect audiovisual 
monkeyshines and the tinkering goes on eroding resistance day by 
day 
back in 1953 kirsten flagstad made a recording of isolde a 
part she had sung on stage many times to perfection but flagstad 
aging allowed a younger prima donna elisabeth schwarzkopf to hit 
the high notes she herself had once sung with ease 
that bit of deception scandalous to many at the time seems 
almost quaint by todays standards 
in the movie flashdance that was not the star jennifer 
beals dancing it was somebody else on a recording of hes a 
rebel which reached no1 on the charts that was not the 
crystals singing despite what the label said no and not all the 
partridge family members were the ones playing the instruments and 
neither were the monkees 
when it leaked out that liza minnelli lipsynched during some of 
her more strenuous dance numbers in the 1977 musical the act 
it set off shock waves all along broadway according to new york 
critic ken mandlebaum it was later considered more or less 
forgivable because she was singing about 20 numbers in seven shows 
a week he said but it was also considered a dangerous 
precedent 
when it was learned last year that rock star janet jackson 
lipsynched parts of her concerts the only shock was in the later 
discovery of how many others were doing the same thing 
it causes you to wonder whatever became of andrew flosdorf 
remember him 
andrew fosdorf was the 1983 national spelling bee contestant 
age 13 who spelled correctly echolalia or so the judges 
ruled but andrew on his own discovered he had misspelled the 
word and eliminated himself from the contest 
i didnt want to feel like a slime he explained 
just so let us then remember william gilberts words in the 
gilbert and sullivan opera hms pinafore and be cautious of 
masquerades and let us also honor the andrew flosdorfs of the 
world with a seasonal salute from tennyson 
ring out the old ring in the new 
ring out the false ring in the true

one of the most accomplished fakes in the 
history of fakery was exposed in 1984 he betrayed himself not by 
his work which was exquisite but by his working drawings 
he was reinhold vasters a german goldsmith who worked in aachen 
in virtual austerity from 1853 to 1890 when he died in 1909 a 
number of his working drawings found their way to the victoria and 
albert museum in london 
there they gathered dust for more than 70 years until a curator 
charles truman began looking them over to see how they related to 
the renaissance jewelry that had obviously inspired them 
he wondered at first whether they were careful records left to 
instruct apprentices no he discovered they were howto drawings 
full of complicated instructions for assembly 
it became apparent to museum curators that numerous creations 
credited the world over to the italian benvenuto cellini 
15001571 were actually the work of vasters one of them was the 
new york metropolitan museums socalled rospigliosi cup 
celebrated as a masterpiece of renaissance art only when the cup 
was taken apart piece by piece did it appear that it had been put 
together in ways that did not exist until vasters own time 
vasters was not only a master deceiver but clearly an 
accomplished artist in his own right so precisely did he work in 
the cellini style that experts say it is unlikely he would ever 
have been unmasked had his drawings not survived

editors note its been more than a decade since the love 
canal neighborhood of niagara falls ny was evacuated declared 
unfit for human habitation because of pollution from a toxic 
chemical dump now people are beginning to return to the 
neighborhood as the debate continues over the threat to their 
health 
</TEXT>

television cameras rolled as brawny 
men lugged richard horns and sandra devantiers furniture 
appliances and a set of golf clubs into their small brick ranch 
house 
passersby stopped to stare the mayor proclaimed it the biggest 
day in the citys history 
twelve years after chemicals leaking into the basements of a 
middleclass neighborhood made love canal a symbol of americas 
toxic waste problems people were finally moving back to the area 
it has been a long battle says mayor michael olaughlin 
the fact that a person finally moved furniture in is an 
outstanding accomplishment in the environmental world 
indeed much has changed at love canal since the summer of 1978 
when the leaking chemicals dumped there three decades earlier by 
hooker chemicals amp plastics corp set off a nationwide scare about 
unseen poisons lurking beneath the earth 
an elementary school and hundreds of houses built on and near 
the dump in the years after hooker abandoned it have been 
bulldozed literally plowed into the ground 
the 70acre site where children played amid chemical volcanoes 
and explosive fire rocks is now a green grassy mound fenced 
off from the world the 22000 tons of chemicals that remain in the 
earth are contained by a system of underground drains that the 
government says should catch any leaks before they can threaten 
the rest of the neighborhood 
the neighborhood even has a new name black creek village 
but one thing hasnt changed since those scary days scientists 
and environmental officials are still divided on whether love canal 
is or ever will be a safe place to live 
the debate has echoed through the halls of power in washington 
and the halls of justice in buffalo and niagara falls it has even 
ripped apart one of new yorks largest environmental groups 
the state health department reported in 1988 that a portion of 
the love canal neighborhood was no more polluted than comparable 
areas elsewhere in niagara falls after months of delay and 
lobbying that reportedly reached into the white house us 
environmental protection agency chief william reilly upheld that 
study last spring 
with reillys approval in hand the love canal area 
revitalization agency put up for sale 10 houses a few blocks north 
of the dump site the agency ultimately hopes to renovate and sell 
as many as 250 of the 1100 houses that the state bought from 
fleeing residents in the early 1990s 
william broderick the agencys head declared love canal to be 
probably the safest area in the city of niagara falls because we 
know the most about it but he concedes that the agency cant 
give home buyers a written guarantee that chemical leaks would not 
recur 
the agency boasted that it had a list of more than 200 people 
who were interested in buying houses in the area but by late 
november only 12 buyers had signed contracts to purchase houses in 
the area and only one house had been occupied the one bought by 
devantier and her fiance horn they moved in on nov 28 
broderick said recently the waiting list evaporated because many 
of the people on it were looking to buy homes at firesale 
prices lower than the 40000 to 60000 the agency was asking 
singlefamily homes in niagara falls sold for an average of 49700 
this year according to the greater buffalo board of realtors 
devantier and horn who declined to speak to reporters paid 
54000 cash for their house 
broderick also said the agencys sales efforts were hampered by 
the reluctance of many local banks to write mortgages on love canal 
property 
but the agency was also dogged by lawsuits from environmental 
groups that said the state study hadnt proved the area was safe 
the environmentalists said that comparing love canal to other parts 
of niagara falls was meaningless because the entire city is 
permeated by the effluent of its massive chemical industry

one of those groups was the state chapter of the sierra club 
the worldwide environmental group based in san francisco 
but the club found itself plunged into a divisive debate because 
one of its board members james carr was the revitalization 
agencys planning director a key spokesman for the resettlement 
effort 
disgruntled members accused carr a past president of the state 
chapter of using his position to try to frustrate the suit after 
months of debate over whether carr should be ousted the national 
sierra club organization threw the chapters entire board out of 
office 
while that dispute was playing out occidental chemical corp 
which purchased hooker in 1968 was trying to fight off the 
governments efforts to make it pay at least 700 million in 
cleanup costs and damages for creating the dump 
the company lost an early round when us district judge john t 
curtin ruled it was liable for the cleanup costs under the federal 
superfund law a 1980 law that was inspired by the events at love 
canal 
but occidental launched a vigorous defense to the states claim 
that the company should pay 250 million in punitive damages for 
its allegedly reckless behavior at the dump 
former residents hooker employees and state workers streamed 
into curtins courtroom in buffalo telling their recollections of 
how hooker turned a pristine canal bed teeming with fish plants 
and muskrat into a chemical wasteland 
a little league coach told how his outfielders chased a long fly 
ball onto the dump property and returned with terrified tales of 
volcanoes erupting in the weeds parents described a pta meeting at 
which they demanded planks be placed on the dump so children would 
not have to wade through chemicals on their way to school 
former employees of hooker and its contractors painted graphic 
pictures of rusty drums that were dumped helterskelter into pits 
breaking open occasionally and spewing fumes into the air one 
worker said he frequently was splashed by the spilled chemicals 
and had to go to nearby houses to wash them off with water or 
gasoline 
the company countered with evidence that hookers procedures for 
waste disposal were the state of the art in their day that broken 
drums were always covered immediately with dirt that the company 
dug pits deep into what it believed was impermeable clay so the 
leaking wastes would not escape into the groundwater 
occidental also began trying to show as the trial evolved into 
a battle of scientists that the state caused unnecessary panic in 
1978 that the hazards from the dump were overstated all along and 
that many of the chemicals detected in air samples in neighborhood 
houses came from common household chemicals such as paint thinners 
thomas h truitt occidentals lead attorney said the company 
still believes the largescale evacuations of the early 1980s were 
unnecessary 
in order to remediate the canal which i stated in my opening 
argument had to be accomplished some evacuation for construction 
purposes was probably necessary truitt said in an interview 
the panic and misinformation that was put into the public 
domain by both the federal and state governments during this period 
made rational thought impossible as a result many more were 
evacuated than had to be 
state officials said occidental was painting too rosy a picture 
of the dumps dangers they also said occidental was not the only 
institution to do so 
the state attorney generals office ruled last fall that a 
videotape about the dumps history used by the revitalization 
agency in its sales pitch to potential home buyers was inaccurate 
and deceptive and forced the agency to stop using it 
critics have charged that the revitalization agency whose 
chairman is mayor olaughlin has been pushing too hard to resettle 
the area in order to get good publicity for the blighted city 
olaughlin denied that charge but conceded that a successful 
resettlement would have a good effect on his citys image 
were always out trying to sell our city and our falls to get 
people to come here he said

should fine missouri horse flesh wind up on 
dinner tables in europe the idea is revolting to some residents of 
one small town where a frenchrun slaughterhouse has just begun 
operations while horse meat is seldom eaten by humans in the 
united states europeans developed a taste for it out of necessity 
during world war ii

future home of horse killing reads a 
banner on main street it protests a new frenchrun 
horseslaughtering plant that has just begun operation in this 
southeast missouri town of about 3500 residents 
the plant is meant to serve the dining tables of europe an idea 
that runs smack against the american love affair with the horse 
a woman whose family breeds arabian horses is organizing a group 
called missourians against slaughtering horses mash to try to 
shut down the plant 
i consider this to be a holocaust for equines says mary 
voertmann of nearby farmington these people are coming in here 
to rape the horse industry this is an outrage 
in the midst of the criticism archway packing co plant 
officials are trying to keep a low profile but its been difficult 
since news leaked out theyve asked for and been granted permission 
from the state to slaughter as many as 100 horses a day and send 
the meat to france belgium italy switzerland and holland for 
human consumption 
to horselovers thats unthinkable to john cross the plants 
operations manager its just another day at the slaughterhouse 
its like all other businesses in the united states cross 
says 
it may not be wellknown but horseslaughtering operations in 
the united states are nothing new there are at least a dozen in 
this country four in texas alone including one in downtown fort 
worth 
great western packing co in morton texas one of the countrys 
largest horse slaughterhouses has killed between 250 and 300 
animals a day for the past 15 years with no major public 
outcry says ben ansolabehere president of the company 
i think this is an industry that takes care of the animals 
that are no longer useful for the riding horse industry or the 
working horse industry and provides a marketable price 
ansolabehere says 
ansolabehere says his company where cross previously worked as 
operations manager pays between 40 and 60 cents per pound for 
horses 
we try to run a professional firstclass operation 
ansolabehere says we put them down in a humane fashion 
horse hides are used for sports equipment and leather goods and 
their meat and entrails are used in the dog food and fertilizer 
industries while its not illegal to sell horse meat for human 
consumption in the united states most of it finds its way into dog 
food but why begrudge european palates 
its a matter of taste i guess and i sure dont want to 
taste it says desloge mayor jack rabaduex whos at the center 
of the conflict 
eating horse meat became something of a necessity in europe 
after world war ii when food was scarce and since then has become a 
tradition 
last year 61000 tons of horse meat was consumed in france 
although the modern generation appears to be losing its taste for 
it in 1979 the country consumed 97000 tons 
still only onesixth of last years total was produced in 
france 
horse owners across missouri fearing their animals will be 
stolen and slaughtered have been expressing outrage to anyone who 
will listen and have disrupted meetings of the desloge city 
council 
theyve generally made life miserable for rabaduex and the city 
council which recently voted 42 to allow the operation to come to 
town 
state rep craig kilby of lake st louis also is keeping the 
pressure on kilby says he will sponsor legislation aimed at 
preventing socalled killer buyers from purchasing healthy 
marketable pleasure horses for slaughter and export 
the humane society of missouri also is opposed noting fears 
that young horses as well as brokendown or illtempered animals 
will be slaughtered 
plant manager cross says most of the horses that will be 
slaughtered in desloge will be bought at livestock auctions selling 
everything from plug horses to goodriding horses 
he scoffs at the notion that archway would employ rustlers to 
steal horses or buy horses from unscrupulous types or slaughter 
young horses which he and others in the industry say produces 
tougher and strongertasting meat 
there will always be some horses stolen but they had that 
problem long before we got here he says 
the desloge operation is at the outskirts of town at the end of 
a dirt road just a few hundred yards from a jehovahs witnesses 
kingdom hall archway has moved into an almost new 2500square 
foot facility that previously was used for slaughtering cattle 
the horses will be killed gutted drained of blood and hung in 
a cooler in less than five minutes says slaughter room supervisor 
jim pyeatt the meat then will be chilled not frozen trucked to 
st louis and flown to archways food distribution unit in france 
the plant will mean jobs for about 25 people for the depressed 
town of 3500 people about 60 miles south of st louis pyeatt says 
he has taken more than 1700 applications 
pyeatt who has eight years experience as a butcher was a 
little leery about the job at first now he goes about town wearing 
his archway shirt with pride 
when i go into restaurants in town theyll ask me if i want a 
pony burger or something pyeatt says but i was out of work 
and this is what i do im not ashamed 
however some residents dont share his enthusiasm 
i hate to see it coming says housewife larnie penberthy 
while pushing a shopping cart out of a local discount store i 
think we could get better business in here

they have stood since the age of chivalry eight 
centuries or more and they are showing their age many of the 
church of englands cathedrals scattered across the countryside are 
crumbling in sad need of repairs but the kinds of repairs that 
are needed will cost millions of dollars money that is not in the 
coffers for the first time the cathedrals have appealed to the 
government for help

brian eacock shook his head as he 
clambered down from a scaffold stretching nearly to the vaulted 
ceiling of worcester cathedral 
another emergency said the cathedrals clerk of works his 
dark hair powdered with the dust of antique stone 
a worshiper happened to notice a stone working loose 70 feet 
above but eacock fixed it in time we were lucky it could have 
dropped he said 
another might drop tomorrow the red sandstone cathedral 
perched elegantly above the river severn in western england needs 
20 million in repairs over the next 15 years church officials 
says 
worcester is not alone 
the church of england has found that half of its 42 cathedrals 
will need at least 140 million by the year 2000 to repair damage 
caused by acid rain natural decay and poor victorian restoration 
work 
famed edifices such as canterbury or londons st pauls survive 
well those such as worcester gloucester and hereford far off the 
beaten path in western england are in pressing need 
last summer cathedral caretakers conceded that individual 
donations marmalade sales and vicars teas cannot preserve the 
buildings banding together for the first time they appealed to 
the government 
unless such assistance is given there is a real danger of our 
cathedral buildings and artifacts falling into a spiral of decay 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie wrote in august to 
thenprime minister margaret thatcher 
the government on nov 8 promised to make 23 million available 
over the next three years 
eacock and his craftsmen meanwhile are planning how to bandage 
the worcester cathedrals weak spots 
in the 11th century bishop wulstan began to erect the present 
church on the site of an earlier cathedral founded by benedictine 
monks wulstans crypt has worn well but the legacies of the 
victorians haunt eacock and his crew 
during massive restorations between 1855 and 1870 workers 
refaced 70 percent of worcester with new stone and replaced 
crumbling gargoyles and statues inside and out the square central 
tower was scraped down several inches to remove decay 
the work saved the great church yet its a slightly mixed 
blessing said worcesters dean the very rev robert jeffery a 
portly man with ben franklin glasses and tufts of untamed white 
hair 
they were tempted to do only the things that showed and they 
used some technologies which proved not to work 
some problems come from the natural decay of stone slate 
timber and lead but the victorians caused others by for instance 
refacing walls with poor quality stone bound to the original walls 
with iron clamps that have rusted expanded and burst the stone 
worcesters been a holding operation for years eacock said 
so far an 8 million crisis appeal has raised 7 million a 
flying buttress has been rebuilt and workers have begun rebuilding 
the north porch each time scaffolding goes up new problems are 
detected 
we keep losing track of the program said eacock who has 
spent 22 years at worcester we have a goal then something else 
comes up 
victorian work is also a problem at gloucester 
what they chose just hasnt stood the test of time said 
dean kenneth jennings who launched an appeal last december for 8 
million 
most cathedrals have been overhauled every 100 to 150 years and 
all the major ones were restored between 1860 and 1880 
it was a mixture of scholarship and need that led to the 
enthusiastic and often good work said alan rome the architect at 
salisbury the 19th century was a period of the first 
appreciation of medieval architecture 
salisbury is in the fourth year of trying to raise 13 million 
to save its famed 404foothigh 14thcentury spire 
cathedrals also suffer wear and tear from bus loads of visitors 
many of whom drop pittances in donation boxes income from visitors 
to worcester rose 15 percent last year to an average of 44 cents 
apiece jeffery said 
i always tell people yes come in its free you dont have 
to pay said john lamplugh chief administrator at winchester in 
southern england but if you dont do something there wont be 
anything here for your grandchildren 
englands cathedrals of which about 30 date from the middle 
ages are mostly smaller than their french and german counterparts 
they evolved however in highly individual ways from the great 
early gothic frontal screens of statuary at wells salisbury and 
lichfield to the elaborate fan vaults on the ceiling of gloucester 
the cathedrals some once very wealthy lived off their 
endowments until 1840 when the church of england distributed the 
savings among smaller churches in return cathedrals were given 
annual incomes which have been eaten away by inflation 
by now certainly they bear little relation to the cost of 
running a cathedral said dr richard gem of the cathedral 
advisory commission a church body of 20 experts and church 
officials 
ely cathedral for instance receives 120000 annually to cover 
all costs except the salaries of its dean and two canons or 
subdeans by 1985 this did not even meet the cost of conducting 
services in the building famed for its unique octagonal central 
tower 
ely began charging admission in 1986 no other cathedral has 
followed suit though some make donations hard to avoid on 
entering 
the clergy at lincoln tried to raise money by sending their copy 
of the 13thcentury magna carta to a worlds fair in australia in 
1988 the venture ended up costing the cathedral 112000 
attempts to raise 16 million for hereford cathedral caused a 
national uproar after dean peter haynes and the chapter the 
cathedrals governing body decided to try to sell its 13thcentury 
mappa mundi 
taken aback by protests the dean and chapter canceled plans to 
auction the map which shows jerusalem at the center of a flat 
world 
in october a new care of cathedrals measure paved the way 
for state funding for the cathedrals 
its unclear how soon government money will be available but 
the very rev wesley carr dean of bristol isnt worried too much 
we at cathedrals dont think in terms of five years but in 
terms of 800 years he said

how do you perform a role made famous by someone 
else its a problem faced in the new york theater this season by 
such actors as cathy rigby linda lavin topol and judd nelson 
try competing with the images of mary martin in peter pan 
ethel merman or tyne daly in gypsy zero mostel in fiddler on 
the roof and jack nicholson in the film version of carnal 
knowledge memories are hard to dislodge 
the ghosts of performances past are particularly potent for 
rigby currently starring on broadway as peter pan a role forever 
associated with martin 
to many people martin was the boy who refused to grow up 
particularly because of the widely seen television version now 
available to a whole new audience on videocassette there have been 
other productions of peter pan too sandy duncan starred in a 
highly successful revival on broadway and then on the road a decade 
or so ago 
i saw sandy first rigby says i watched her play peter a 
couple of times and was more inspired than anything from her 
performance in the beginning i patterned my own performance after 
hers because she was a wonderful example since then it has 
changed dramatically now im a very different peter pan 
mary martins portrayal was at a time when production values 
were different people were different much calmer theres a line 
in peter pan that goes children know such a lot now it can 
apply to any generation it really applies to how children look at 
peter pan now vs when we were watching shows like lassie on 
television years ago it was just different we believed a little 
more easily 
for rigby the key has been preparation not only for this role 
but for her entire acting career the performer who was a 
gymnastic star of the 1972 olympics started in show business with 
an arena tour of peter pan that she says was more disney on 
parade than live theater everything was prerecorded after 
that she took voice and acting lessons for six years before she 
ventured out on stage again 
gymnastics gives you confidence rigby says you learn 
that if you work at something you get better even when the 
pressure is on if you have the preparation youre going to get 
through it somehow 
she must be doing something right rigbys current tour of 
peter pan which has been on the road for a year could only 
come to broadway for six weeks because it already has commitments 
on the lucrative touring circuit into next summer 
other actors arent as confident stuart howard casting 
director for such recent broadway revivals as fiddler on the 
roof gypsy and cat on a hot tin roof says theres one 
basic reason performers shy away from wellknown roles fear 
many actors are frightened of someone elses memory says 
howard who experienced the problem last season when trying to cast 
the role of big daddy the dying southern patriarch in a revival of 
tennessee williams cat on a hot tin roof 
any actor playing big daddy must erase the portrait drawn by 
burl ives who originally played the role on broadway and in the 
movie version that starred elizabeth taylor and paul newman 
several actors declined to audition for the cat revival 
although the combination of the role the play its star kathleen 
turner as maggie and the director howard davies attracted a great 
many other performers 
and charles durning the actor who eventually got the role was 
able to make it his own walking off with most of the favorable 
reviews and winning a tony for his performance 
all three of the revivals howard worked on started with a star 
turner topol and tyne daly and then built the production around 
them but even daly had to audition for director arthur laurents 
and producers fran and barry weissler 
the actress best known as half of televisions cagney and 
lacey confronted the memory of ethel merman headon in 
interviews before opening on broadway she would say if you want 
to hear ethel merman stay home and listen to the record im not 
ethel merman i wont be ethel merman im tyne daly and if youd 
like to see me do a show then come 
a good director can also help a performer overcome memories of a 
star and make a revival more than a museum piece 
everything with gypsy was done fresh new sets new 
costumes new lighting howard says and a new approach 
laurents built it around tyne daly he built it around her 
personality he did not have her copy ethel merman in any way 
when linda lavin replaced daly she had the additional problem 
of competing against recent memories as well as past ones despite 
mixed reviews lavin thrived in the role extending the life of the 
revival by six months 
mermans memory also hovered over a new complete recording of 
girl crazy the gershwin show that made the bold brassy singer 
a star the unenviable task of belting out i got rhythm fell to 
lorna luft a singer with a softer style than mermans 
i wasnt intimidated at all luft says i had done the 
show before in michigan so i was familiar with the material 
besides i was honored and grateful to be part of this historic 
album 
judd nelson along with justine bateman jon cryer and karen 
byers had a harder time with the stage version of jules feiffers 
carnal knowledge feiffer actually wrote the play before doing 
the screenplay for the critically acclaimed 1971 movie version 
but the powerful and controversial film which starred jack 
nicholson candice bergen art garfunkel and annmargret dwarfed 
the play and when comparisons were made by theater critics the 
movie and its stars came off better than the play and its young 
performers 
topol had a different problem with fiddler on the roof for 
many audiences his performance as tevye the milkman and not 
mostels original broadway performance was the definitive one 
topol had played the role in the original london production and in 
the movie nearly 20 years ago in a sense he was competing with 
himself 
i think its a very different performance today howard 
says its much more humorous and now topol really is the right 
age to play tevye 
still each production regardless of its stars has to stand or 
fall by itself 
the thing we had to do with this production of peter pan is 
that despite all the special effects the flying the fog the 
mylar and all that youre not going to compete with steven 
spielberg so youd better just tell the story and youd better 
tell it well rigby says

the godfather part iii 
 
francis ford coppolas operatic upbringing dominates his best 
films the first two godfathers were jammed with lush music and 
violent drama the most memorable part of apocalypse now was 
the helicopter raid accompanied by richard wagner 
coppola reaches his operatic height with the climax of the 
godfather part iii while cavalleria rusticana thunders on a 
palermo stage assassinations take place at the theater in a mafia 
headquarters and deep within the vaitcan even the pope is not 
spared 
this is coppola at his demonic best combining sublime music 
brutal murder and miraculous editing for the ultimate film 
experience what goes before will please some godfather 
devotees and disappoint others taken alone godfather iii 
could be considered film storytelling of the highest order 
comparisons are unavoidable and it would have been superhuman for 
coppola to excel the academy awardwinning the godfather and 
the godfather part ii 
while its predecessors had the inspired performances of marlon 
brando robert de niro robert duvall james caan and others the 
new film relies primarily on al pacino he plays the aging don as a 
tragic hamlet brooding and indecisive reluctant to order bloody 
deeds in 1979 the corleone family has gone legit abandoning its 
shady enterprises though not its ties to the association 
the most gripping sequence comes when a renegade upsets an 
association meeting this time in atlantic city not appalachia 
after the upstart is dispatched in another brilliantly staged scene 
of violence the story shifts to italy 
vatican finances have been looted by the italian mafia and don 
corleone is enlisted to straighten things out the power struggle 
slows the pace but all is settled in the climax 
andy garcia as sonny corleones bastard son is adopted by 
pacino as his chief lieutenant and the young actor confirms his 
star status he is magnetic on the screen less so is sofia 
coppola who plays pacinos daughter the tragic love between her 
and garcia falls short 
pacino dominates the film with his powerful presence diane 
keaton returning as his divorced wife kay strongly portrays his 
unheeded conscience the corleone sister talia shire has been 
transformed into lady macbeth when murder of a rival gang leader 
is discussed she mutters to garcia do it 
godfather iii is filled with fine actors eli wallach joe 
mantegna bridget fonda helmut berger raf vallone donal 
donnelly opera singer franc dambrosio is a standout as the 
corleone son who chooses music instead of working for the mob its 
good to see george hamilton of course looking tanned and terrific 
though he has little to do but advise on finances 
coppola produced and directed the film and wrote it with mario 
puzo they have created a worthy continuation of the saga f one of 
americas first families its a fond hope andy garcia in the 
godfather part iv 
the paramount release is rated r for language and excessive 
violence running time 161 minutes 
by bob thomas associated press writer 
 
 
 
bonfire of the vanities 
 
theres something about a brian de palma movie thats just not 
right theres always something offcenter or riding the razors 
edge of sloppiness its like a welldressed woman with perfect 
makeup who opens her mouth to reveal a lipstick blotch on her 
teeth and whose dirty torn slip shows beneath her hemline 
dressed to kill started off as a fastpaced slick erotic 
tease and promptly slipped into a very careless bmovie 
scarface also had the promise of a hard edge with a lot of 
tension and drama and then deteriorated into a drug joke the 
untouchables borrowed so heavily from other movies that it was 
hard to get much honesty out of it 
now comes bonfire of the vanities based on the novel by tom 
wolfe whats off about this latest de palma work is that the movie 
cant be taken seriously the characters are straight out of a 
comic strip and proceed through some cartoonlike situations and 
so viewed in this way it becomes an enjoyable romp 
sherman mccoy is a selfstyled master of the universe who is a 
millionaire and has an uptight snotty wife and a spoiled married 
mistress maria his very ordered and affluent life comes crumbling 
down after his mistress runs over a man in the south bronx flees 
the scene and leaves sherman holding the bag 
its not just another hit and run the victim is black sherman 
and maria are white a local black minister the rev bacon wants 
to make the accident into a racial cause celebre the district 
attorney who wants to run for mayor needs minority votes and is 
eager to prove that the city goes after white criminals just as 
diligently as it does black criminals 
riding the periphery of it all is a downandout drunk whose 
career in journalism is about to come to a screeching halt peter 
fallow fallow chronicles it all gets the inside track and 
ultimately produces a bestselling book 
there are a few cute twists to the story of shermans fall and 
fallows rise but all are as predictable as fallows next drink 
as sherman tom hanks looking very odd with capped teeth and 
precision cut hair is somewhat jerky and nervous he looks in pain 
throughout the movie like hes walking on glass and not quite sure 
how to get off 
melanie griffith has finally found her niche and is quite 
believable as maria ruskin a manipulating bubblehead 
bruce willis somewhat overdoes the drunk routine for fallow 
without much style it becomes a trifle boring after a while but 
willis is willis and remains his acerbic self 
about the only likeable character in the entire movie is morgan 
freemans judge white he also is the only character who bears any 
semblance to reality 
theres good support from kim cattrall as judy mccoy saul 
rubinek as jed kramer f murray abraham as the da and john hancock 
as rev bacon

elizabethan christmas anthems amon ra red byrd and the rose 
consort of viols 
for unto us a child is born crd choir of new college 
oxford collegium novum ensemble directed by edward higginbottom 
heinrich schutz die weihnachtshistorien hyperion the kings 
consort directed by robert king 
20th century christmas collection collins the sixteen 
directed by harry christophers 
 
three new recordings for christmas reflect some profitable 
digging in the more or less obscure repertory of the 17th century 
red byrd has exhumed some genuine rarities such as upon my 
lap a moving lullaby set by martin peerson who was organist at 
st pauls cathedral in the early 1600s quite as obscure is the 
starre anthem by john bull who worked at the chapel royal 
before decamping to belgium and the verse anthem o ye little 
flock by john amner who worked in the splendid isolation of ely 
cathedral the clarity of the singing goes a long way to atone for 
the inadequate notes which are devoid of texts 
in this recording professional singers try to sound like 
skilled amateurs in a manor house a thoroughly unnecessary stab at 
one facet of authenticity orlando gibbons verse anthems this is 
the record of john and see see the word is incarnate are 
better known and without doubt sound better in recordings by 
cathedral choirs but red byrds roughhewn singing is always 
professional and the playing of the rose consort of viols is 
polished and pleasant 
the disc is worth hearing simply for the lullaby by the 
great william byrd which was also recorded a few years ago by the 
tallis scholars the bestknown song is by anonymous sweet was 
the song the virgin sang 
the choir of new college has a modern version of that last song 
set by oliver johnstone a 13yearold member of the choir the 
albums strengths however come from the grand polychoral style of 
the 17th century supplemented by sacbuts strings and organ the 
choir makes bright work of heinrich schutzs awesome hodie 
christus natus est jh scheins quem vidistis pastores and 
samuel scheidts carollike puer natus 
the kings consort recording of schutzs christmas story 
earns the ultimate american bandstand accolade you can dance to 
it at least you might for the last two minutes when schutz lets 
rip with a rollicking syncopated blast of trumpets and chorus an 
inspired combination of high art and high spirits amazing music to 
have come from a 75yearold man 
in contrast to such joyful noises the collection of 
20thcentury music by the sixteen is better suited to candlelight 
and quiet in the hours past midnight the best songs are benjamin 
brittens gorgeous hymn to the virgin john taveners the 
lamb and herbert howells more familiar a spotless rose 
on the more rambunctious side the sixteen include william 
waltons hearty make we joy now in this fest and john 
gardners setting of tomorrow shall be my dancing day on the 
obnoxious side in parts is peter maxwell davies o magnum 
mysterium which has moments of those odd popping and beeping 
noises which make modern synonymous with tedious

the immaculate collection sire madonna 
 
is anyone really surprised that madonna has managed to generate 
the biggest controversy of the holiday music buying season with her 
sexy video to justify my love 
the forbes magazine cover girl is the savviest marketer on the 
music scene with a keen sense of how to push the envelope of 
public respectability enough to keep her detractors tongues 
wagging her supporters cheering and herself on the front page 
not surprisingly the immaculate collection a greatest 
hits package with a title itself a tweak at the catholic church 
is flying out of the stores 
the cd however may surprise those who view madonna with a 
jaundiced eye its terrific 
placing all those hits back to back to back makes clear that 
shes managed over the past six years to record some of the 
finest pop music of our time although the qsound recording 
technique isnt as revolutionary as hailed the remixed songs 
crackle and spark 
holiday though not quite the groundbreaker described in the 
cds hyperbolic liner notes is a buoyant introduction to madonnas 
style like a virgin and like a prayer stripped of the 
hype that surrounded their videos stand strong musically 
what seem most impressive in retrospect are the songs that 
didnt grab immediate attention because they were the second or 
third singles off albums such tunes as cherish or express 
yourself clearly inspired by 1960s artists and songs theyre 
nonetheless stamped with style 
the only bad choice is the forgettable la isla bonita which 
could have been replaced by burnin up from the first album or 
the swinging hanky panky off her latest record 
the two new songs also warrant inclusion in this collection not 
just because one has already become a hit justify my love 
while slight musically smolders with madonnas sexuality and lenny 
kravitzs rhythm track 
and the final cut rescue me is nothing less than a 
statement of purpose partdance pop partrap she sings of the 
redemptive power of love in a voice that growls sensually and purrs 
with sweetness 
say what you will about madonnas clothes her attitude her 
videos musically where it counts shes right on target with 
the immaculate collection

hells ditch island the pogues 
 
the problem with the pogues some would say their appeal 
always has been a reckless approach that resulted in a wildly 
uneven mix of music from unlistenable punk rants to interminable 
irish laments with some really fine music in between 
on hells ditch their fifth us release the pogues manage 
to stick to the middle ground they are tamed by producer joe 
strummer who gained vast experience as a leader of the clash in 
making passionate music palatable the result is a consistently 
enjoyable record 
nine of the 13 cuts were written or cowritten by vocalist shane 
macgowan whose brilliantly dark poetry revels in liquor lust and 
life in the gutter its not a very pretty world but it sort of 
sounds like fun 
the eightmember band keeps things moving briskly along prodded 
by spider stacys whistle and a bevy of acoustic instruments and 
when they slow down as on the short dreamy ballad summer in 
siam the results are sweet indeed

debra winger is pondering life her left arm is 
raised to eye level the elbow perched on the opposite wrist and 
her cigarette slants upwards as it rests between her fingers 
the actress spent six months in the sahara filming the 
sheltering sky and in some ways she hasnt quite returned its 
a joke isnt it she says looking around taking in the hotel 
restaurant opened especially for her 
but her career still matters more than ever winger works full 
time reading thinking talking looking for selfknowledge that 
can be collected and stored for future roles and looking for roles 
that can bring her selfknowledge 
my life affects my work and work affects my life winger 
explains i work more and more towards homogenization i dont 
want to be the sort of person who puts on a hat by the door and 
goes out you have to find a way to intermingle the two you have 
to find a way to show your growth in your work 
the sheltering sky based on paul bowles acclaimed 1949 
novel stars winger and john malkovich as a wealthy american couple 
who travel through the desert in africa discovering unpleasant 
truths about their marriage and themselves bernardo bertolucci 
directed his first film since the academy awardwinning the last 
emporer 
she was saved from beauty by the intensity of her gaze 
bowles wrote of wingers character but life and art have separated 
this afternoon wingers blue eyes so animated on screen are 
soft almost indistinguishable from the rest of her face her 
calmer self has risen to the top 
she sums up the past in two words no regrets not about 
fights with directors and fellow actors not about her brief 
marriage to actor timothy hutton not about turning down the part 
in broadcast news that made a star of holly hunter 
two other words momentarily upset her make her gag and cough as 
if someone had put a fly in her coffee the words are turbulent 
brilliance and they were used by shirley maclaine on academy 
awards night in 1984 to assess her terms of endearment costar 
i have a tshirt that shirley gave me the day after the 
academy awards when she felt the necessity to call me turbulent and 
brilliant instead of just brilliant said winger who lost to 
maclaine for best actress 
she heard i was a little rattled and the tshirt said 
turbulent means brilliant oh give me a break if it needs an 
explanation dont say it 
on sand or on pavement its been a bumpy ride for winger born 
in cleveland in 1955 her decision to become an actress was 
fittingly turbulent a matter quite literally of life and death 
on new years eve 1973 she was thrown from a moving truck and 
nearly died from a cerebral hemorrhage winger was studying 
sociology and criminology at the time but quickly lost interest 
i wanted to act before but i was still under the pull of my 
parents and sort of under the middleclass work ethic it was a 
hobby you know you dont actually do that for a living 
but when somebody experiences death near death you realize 
youre all alone at the end and i said i cant do something 
another day that i wont be completely fulfilled in 
in such films as an officer and a gentleman and terms of 
endearment winger acts as if the screech of the trucks tires 
still rings in her ears her lips tremble her head shakes her 
eyes consume entire rooms she pushes a baby carriage with the 
intensity of a lumberjack chopping wood she makes listening to 
ethel merman seem like an act of defiance 
winger admits to problems with drugs and temperament in the 
past but insists they didnt keep her from working that she knew 
which experiences were best to draw on 
an old story about john barrymore draws out her bubbly staccato 
laugh the actor was in london supposedly to star in hamlet 
but spending most of his time chasing women 
hours before opening night he succeeded his dress rehearsal 
consisted of scotch wine and a hospitable duchess he arrived a 
half hour before curtain time and passed out in his dressing room 
i was the first american to play hamlet on a london stage 
and i was also the first drunk to play it on any stage in the 
world he recalled 
the lights made him dizzy he had to lean on another actor to 
keep from falling down he would exit in the middle of a scene and 
vomit in the wings he performed his soliloquy sprawled in a chair 
but i missed no words of will shakespeares and i missed no 
cue barrymore boasted the critics raved never had turbulence 
and brilliance worked so well together art had triumphed over 
life or was it the other way around 
for every actor theres that adrenalin that gets going once 
the curtain goes up or once the camera starts rolling only for me 
the process begins a little sooner winger says 
sometimes i feel like the town idiot people can be saying 
terrible things about me people can hate me but i dont care i 
just want to keep doing what im doing

tell ringo starr hes one of the elder 
statesmen of rock n roll and he interrupts 
im probably the eldest statesman he corrects 
but he says it in that ringo voice instantly familiar and 
unchanged although its owner is 50 years old and light years past 
his beatle days 
rock n roll keeps you young if it doesnt kill you of 
course he explains 
starr has just released ringo starr and his allstarr band 
a compact disc recorded in concert during his 1989 tour with eight 
veteran rockers and hes already thinking about the lineup for 
another allstarr troupe 
its a different ringo than the one who was better known over 
much of the past decade for drinking than drumming and the 
enthusiasm has as much to do with last years tour as his 1988 
stint in an alcoholic recovery program 
it was great proof to me that i could actually get up there 
and play he said and it was great proof that all these 
musicians that ive known all over the years you know still 
thought theyd like to play with me 
the allstarrs of 1989 were guitarists nils lofgren and joe 
walsh keyboard players dr john and billy preston saxman clarence 
clemons drummers jim keltner and levon helm and bass player rick 
danko 
starr admits to wondering whether he could get on stage with 
musicians of that caliber again and whether they would want to get 
up there with him 
most of the 80s i was incommunicado with the planet and you 
know i wouldnt blame em you know because why would they want to 
get up with this crazy drunken fool and i didnt want to get up 
anyway i was too busy getting stupid 
starr and his wife actress barbara bach spent five weeks in an 
alcohol treatment program in 1988 and after that he had to ask 
himself what he was going to do with his life the allstarr band 
was the answer 
im a musician and we went out there and we put it together 
and it was just a great mindblower that it certainly worked and we 
all had fun he said 
the rykodisc cd has a dozen songs but only five featuring 
starr it dont come easy the nono song honey dont 
youre sixteen and photograph 
the others are iko iko by dr john the weight with 
helm on vocals shine silently sung by lofgren quarter to 
three featuring clemons raining in my heart with danko at 
the microphone will it go round in circles by preston and 
life in the fast lane featuring walsh 
starr is intent on getting beyond his beatles past 
someone already said well you dont have little help from 
my friends yellow submarine well you know thats not the 
point here the point is the band that was on tour and this is 
what we felt would make the best cd 
its fun he says being able to step out front and sing but 
not have to stay there stepping back to let others have the 
spotlight 
starr doesnt know yet who will be in the next allstarr band 
because some of last years members will almost certainly have 
other commitments but starr is certain to have an audience 
regardless of the complement 
the 89 tour drew fans ranging from children on up to adults as 
old as 70 children under 7 were let in free with their parents to 
make the problem of finding baby sitters no impediment he said 
a lot of the kids were more familiar with starr as the tiny mr 
conductor of the pbs television show shining time station the 
childrens show includes a storybook segment from thomas the tank 
engine and friends an english show starr narrated 
starr has no trouble seeing himself as a family entertainer and 
apparently neither do the fans 
you have to grow up and everybodys grown up with me he 
said the albums and cds sell constantly and im always getting 
letters from kids you know kids will stop me in the street who are 
much too young to have been around when we the beatles were 
actually working 
i think they honestly know i was in this huge monster band 
and it actually meant something but i think the most important 
thing about it is that the records still hold up of course 
ive also got them coming at my face now about thomas the tank and 
shining time station theyre holding little babies up now itll 
never end

willie morris good ole boy love for 
the south and fascination for author william faulkner have produced 
a moving tribute to the life and times of the late nobel prize 
winner in faulkners mississippi 
he was a fellow mississippian and a fellow writer and i 
wanted to present him as a human being not as an icon said 
morris whose books north toward home terrains of the 
heart and good old boy and the witch of yazoo spun 
mindcapturing tales of his own boyhood days in yazoo city 
faulkners mississippi rich with photographs of the oxford 
area that was faulkners home and the setting for his mythical 
yoknapatawpha county mississippi is a spinoff of a 1989 magazine 
article on faulkner by morris 
a few months after the article came out in national 
geographic i remarked to willie that it had been so highly 
acclaimed it should be expanded into a book said larry wells of 
the oxfordbased yoknapatawpha press and a longtime morris friend 
who edited the text of the book 
morris writer in residence at the university of mississippi 
approaches faulkners life with the insight of a writer who while 
aware of faulkners literary impact is able to tap into the heart 
of a man whose neighbors both loved and reviled him in the same 
breath 
his spirit is still here of course in the woodsmoke of 
november from the forlorn country shacks in the fireflies in 
driftless random in the town in june in the summer wisteria on the 
greenswards and the odor of verbena in the ruined old mansions in 
the yocona bottoms in the echoes of an axe on wood and of dogs 
barking far away in the languid human commerce on the courthouse 
square in the aged whites and blacks bantering on the brick wall 
beside the jail morris writes in introducing faulkner to his 
readers 
in an interview morris said i tried to assess in the most 
human way the way faulkners native mississippi and the south 
shaped him as a man and as an artist and also the way that he 
shaped mississippi and the south 
faulkner both as a writer and as a person shaped willie 
morris he added indeed i think almost every southern writer 
indeed almost every american writer has tried to deal with 
faulkner walker percy called him the curse of every american 
writer because his work was so monumental 
i hope people realize through this work that faulkners land 
is still here said morris a rhodes scholar who became the 
youngest editor in chief ever at harpers magazine 
parenthetically i think his work today has more of an impact and 
relevance that it did in its own day i still see his yoknapatawpha 
county everywhere not only spiritually but emotionally 
the 160page oversize book 50 contains 60 pages of color 
photographs by william eggleston the book was packaged by atticus 
press and yoknapatawpha press and published by oxmoor house in 
birmingham ala 
this work was a natural for willie wells said because he 
knows mississippi in his soul and his description of faulkners 
mississippi both the real and fictional yoknapatawpha county 
evoke the past and the present in much the same way faulkners own 
work did 
morris brought a special sensitivity to the work as former 
editor of harpers he supported and encouraged his fellow writers 
and that sympathy is very much in evidence in this book 
his portrait of faulkner is very revealing a prodigal son 
count no count who wrote the sensational thriller sanctuary 
in 1931 and was dubbed the corncob man 
the book also presents a funny and poignant treatment of 
faulkners finances noting he had to go to hollywood and write 
screen plays to earn a living in the 1930s and 40s 
perhaps the best section is morris treatment of faulkner and 
civil rights 
this is a subject that willie has written a couple of books 
about and he knows all its ramifications wells said 
morris describes faulkners stand in trying to be a moderating 
force in a time of hysteria and passion in a way that helps the 
reader understand both the man and the times 
perhaps one sentence provides the best example of morris 
understanding of faulkner and his land this haunted countryside 
around oxford is dotted with crumbling houses darkly resonating the 
past and the vanished people who once lived in them and i sense 
the author was as possessed by them as poe was of being buried 
alive the stirrings of old twilight conversations of mute 
possessions and fears and loves in the gone charters of time 
i wanted to offer a genuine human portrait of the man

produce those monumental words he was a very complicated human 
being of course but at the same time he was only human

williams was born and sang with him for more than 20 years 
some 40 years ago kilgore was doing less glamorous work for the 
senior williams 
i was a gofer the voluble kilgore recalled in an 
interview i helped set the stage helped sell programs and 
loaded the instruments in the trailer hed give me 5 every now 
and then 
my life is strange it seems like a circle that somehow ive 
always been connected with the williams family 
right now he oversees the business affairs for the younger 
williams known for singing the introduction to abc monday night 
football for the past two seasons 
kilgore directs a road crew of 32 and an office staff of 17 
while making milliondollar business decisions for his boss whose 
hit records include all my rowdy friends are coming over

greats he also worked with elvis presley just as the king was 
launching his career in the mid1950s 
in shreveport la on the old louisiana hayride country music 
show kilgore witnessed a rarity a presley failure the first 
time he sang on the hayride he bombed it was shocking the way he 
shook when he sang and the audience just gasped 
he came off the stage and looked at me and said i cant 
believe this is not going over 
but things changed on the second show of the night he got 
into the second verse of thats all right mama and they 
exploded 
kilgore is a longtime friend of audrey williams the wife of 
hank williams sr and the mother of hank williams jr through her 
he developed close ties to the younger williams 
comparing father and son kilgore says they are very much 
alike hank can look at you just like his father used to they both 
loved hunting fishing and sports 
hank jr loves football and the abc monday night football 
deal was a dream come true for him 
and we found out joe montana quarterback for the san 
francisco 49ers psyched himself up for the super bowl by playing 
all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight 
the younger williams became a top draw after surviving a 
500foot fall down a montana mountain in 1975 kilgore who was 
williams opening act for 21 years until turning to the business 
side was one of the first to visit him in the hospital

was broken his survival was a blessing of god

justin edwards carpenter amateur photographer bicyclist and 
sailing enthusiast doesnt strike an observer as a sentimental 
man but after his girlfriend annie chervin admired a particular 
engagement ring while they were window shopping one spring day in 
1988 he quietly went back to the shop and bought it without 
telling her 
fast forward now to a dinner on feb 21 1989 justin had 
suggested they get dressed up even though they were eating at 
home a 75 bottle of wine signaled a special occasion 
the wine was wasted on me recalls annie because after 
justin said do you want to get married and i said yes he 
pulled out that ring and gave it to me 
their thoughts quickly turned to an outdoor wedding they could 
see the perfect site by looking out their window it was the 
expansive lawn surrounding the apartment which occupies part of a 
landmark colonial house in south salem ny a small town about 50 
miles north of new york city 
typical of many couples these days annie and justin already 
were living together and they planned to arrange and pay for their 
wedding themselves and they wanted a party that wouldnt offend 
their parents sense of decorum 
as soon as their obliging landlord gave them permission to hold 
the ceremony and reception on the grounds annie and justin began 
planning the wedding which would take place a little more than a 
year later on may 19 1990 
their first budget estimate was 10000 and they did manage to 
keep costs to under 11000 ultimately most of the cost was 
covered by annies parents alexander and edith chernin of 
montreal as a wedding gift 
as a floral designer and photographic stylist annie now 33 
says she knew she had the skills to plan a wedding with 80 guests 
i already had done flowers for weddings and coordinated models 
props logistics and food on many photographic shoots she 
recalls justin 31 would lend moral support help make decisions 
and handle many of the technical chores such as lighting and 
sound 
they agreed they wanted an informal yet dignified affair at 
which their friends and farflung families she is originally from 
montreal and he is english would get a chance to meet 
having everyone there from all the different aspects of our 
life was important to us says justin 
we started out with the thought of a nontraditional party 
but as we got closer to the date it got more traditional annie 
says 
taking on many of the tasks herself let her have things just as 
she wanted and let her work with friends and acquaintances who 
enjoyed creating the party as much as she did herself she says 
annie started her planning by making a list of what she thought 
she would need for the wedding and then went straight to the yellow 
pages for names she telephoned first for information about rental 
costs and availability following up with visits to those vendors 
she considered good possibilities 
when possible she hired people she already knew the caterer 
danyell ray of greenwich is a friend as are the cake baker and 
photographer otherwise she relied on instinct choosing people 
who she felt were both professional and pleasant 
one of the first important decisions was to find someone to 
marry them annie is jewish justins grandfather was a minister 
and he grew up in a church of england family they wanted a 
religious service that would be comfortable to both families 
they asked the rev scudder edwards not related to the groom 
minister of the nearby south salem presbyterian church to perform 
the ceremony 
he was sensitive to our desire to weave the two religions 
together recalls justin 
he was willing to take out the holy ghost but leave god in 
says anniehe gave us a standard ceremony book to look at and 
told us to put a bracket around any words that made us 
uncomfortable 
this important matter settled they moved on to select caterer 
menu photographer and music they found rental sources for a 
large tent with a dance floor tables and chairs dishes glasses 
and silver tablecloths and portable toilet facilities 
they also had to find restaurant locations for prewedding 
events and lodgings for the many outoftown guests including her 
family and friends from canada and some of his relatives from 
britain his parents michael and shiela edwards live nearby in 
coventry conn clothing for the wedding party had to be selected 
annie created her own invitations and with the help of a friend 
who is a florist chose and arranged the wedding flowers she and 
justin taped the music for the wedding procession and recession 
and they chose a festive menu of interesting but healthful food 
brides often talk of being nervous as their wedding day 
approaches but for annie and justin the hours rushed by as they 
made their preparations 
i didnt have time to be nervous says annie who was up at 
630 am to start on flower arrangements besides the bouquet 
which florist karen mcgowan created with flowers annie had chosen 
there were table decoratons for the tent and flowers and greens to 
adorn the lawn where the service would be held 
justin was up by 7 am and was soon at work on the sound system 
and the temporary outdoor lighting he was rigging up with some help 
from michael orcutt one of his ushers annies brother and sisters 
set the tables working from the model she set up for them 
the day of an outdoor party is usually a worrisome time will 
the weather cooperate the morning of may 19 dawned chilly the 
winds were strong enough to occasion anxious glances skyward as the 
day progressed 
but there were few mishaps one was minor damage to his truck 
when justin backed it out of the driveway into the path of an 
oncoming car the people in the other car were mollified when they 
learned it was his wedding day 
by 430 pm the wind had died down the tables were set the 
flowers arranged and there was just enough time for the couple to 
duck into the house and change from jeans to wedding clothes each 
dressed in a different area since they observed the traditional 
prohibition against the groom seeing the bridal gown before the 
ceremony 
annie recalls it took her a half hour to shower do her hair 
put on her makeup and put on her dress an ethereal creation in 
silk and lace 
a few minutes past 5 pm the wedding procession began with 
their attendants justin and annie strolled down a grassy path 
under a grapevine trellis and they were married in front of family 
and friends just as theyd planned 
then after hors doeuvre on the terrace minipizzas 
tofusesame meatballs skewered swordfish and smoked salmon the 
guests moved into the heated tent to dance and dine on grilled 
salmon chicken wild rice salad french cheeses and fruit and the 
traditional english wedding cake of white iced fruitcake served 
buffet style 
while everyone was still dancing and white candles in glass 
holders glittered like fireflies on the lawn annie and justin 
stole away to a quiet inn in connecticut certain that their 
wedding was a fitting finale to their year of planning

as a floral designer annie chervin looked forward to choosing 
and arranging the flowers for her own wedding 
so two days before her may 19 wedding she and her sister 
nancy rose at 4 am and drove 50 miles from south salem ny to 
new york city by 530 am they were strolling through the 
wholesale flower market on the lower west side 
i didnt have any particular flowers in mind ahead of time i 
wanted to be inspired by what i saw in the market she recalls 
annie found inspiration for her bridal bouquet in green lilies 
and white lilies with burgundy veining she bought beaded 
eucalyptus to weave into a wreath for her hair and variegated ivy 
for her flower girls basket she also bought sweet pea vines with 
slender green pea pods already formed in case the two types of 
lilies needed augmenting for the mothers grandmothers and grooms 
sister she bought gardenias and phalanopsis orchids 
she decided she would pick some of the lily of the valley 
growing in the garden at home for the flower girls basket the 
bridesmaids bouquets and as boutonnieres for the groom and his 
attendants 
to decorate a trellis under which the wedding procession would 
pass she bought stock in cream and white for the buffet table she 
chose a sheaf of a tall grass that looked like wheat and blue 
delphinium and loveinthemist as well as three big artichokes on 
a stem 
each of the 12 dining tables would have a flowering herbal 
topiary which she had already ordered from a connecticut herb 
farm 
after completing their flower market purchases three hours 
later annie and nancy stopped at balduccis a famous gourmet 
produce shop in greenwich village where they bought flowering kale 
and other interestinglooking vegetables to further embellish the 
buffet table 
i didnt buy anything that would be hard to condition such as 
roses or greens with a milky substance she says 
arriving home she stripped off the leaves and trimmed the stems 
of the flowers then put them in vases with tepid water i left 
them in the garage which was the perfect cool and dark place for 
them 
there they sat until the morning of her wedding when they were 
arranged by annie and her friend karen mcgowan also a florist 
annie spent 330 at the wholesale flower market and 125 for the 
topiaries her cost of 475 is just under the 478 that brides 
magazine says is the average expenditure for flowers at weddings 
in choosing unusual blossoms and mixing commercially grown 
flowers with garden flowers herbs and vegetables she was 
revealing a romantic sensibility that is in keeping with bridal 
trends which emphasize novelty and originality in both selection of 
blooms and their arrangement 
people dont want to look at a book and order number 24 they 
want something unusual says alexandra randall a florist and 
photo stylist in st james ny 
how unusual recently randall executed a bridal bouquet in the 
form of a boa of heather and 100 roses which the bride wore around 
her shoulders and draped over her arms 
floral designers also are improving on nature for a recent 
issue of brides randall created a flower by inserting a bundle of 
six miniature serena roses into a large lily the bouquet 
containing several of these fantasy flowers was set off with a 
border of ladys mantle a green herb that looks like curly parsley 
or green babys breath 
for the same issue of the magazine floral designer curtis 
godwin inserted a spray of lily of the valley into each of several 
large yellow calla lily blooms on a single stalk so the entire 
bouquet emerges from one stem 
though unusual today the idea of stuffing smaller blossoms into 
larger ones was popular in earlier eras says randall the 
victorians did it and in the 1950s there was a craze for 
socalled glamelias the creations were actually gladiolus 
flowers arranged one inside the other to create the look of a 
multipetaled camellia 
these days there is little need to imitate outofseason flowers 
because air transportation and improvements in breeding techniques 
have led to almost constant availability of all types of flowers 
says rocky pollitz a vice president of teleflora a floral wire 
service based in los angeles if you are willing to pay for them 
your wedding flowers can be virtually anything you might wish 
for she says 
choosing unexpected flowers is just one way to achieve 
originality unusual bouquet shapes are another one new look is a 
waterfall bouquet in which the flowers are arranged in a cascade of 
bloom says pollitz heartshaped bouquets pomander balls on wands 
and tiny nosegays of miniature flowers are some other examples of 
fashionable styles fresh flowers also are often entwined in the 
hair arranged to cover a chignon or used to trim a hat 
color trends in floral bouquets include multicolor mixtures and 
unexpected color combinations such as champagne roses and beige 
stock with deep purple pansies or english lavender instead of the 
traditional allwhite or pale bouquet many brides are choosing 
colorful arrangements many quite naturally select their flowers to 
complement their dresses especially those in a period style

both practicality and sentiment had a part in annie chervins 
wedding dress choice 
the westchester county ny bride had her french vanilla silk 
gown made to order it was a copy of a 3000 dress that she tried 
on in an upscale department store but cost her less than half 
1220 it had the same peau de soie bodice offtheshoulder 
neckline appliqued with satin rosettes and graceful skirt of four 
layers of tulle 
part of me wanted to buy the expensive dress recalls annie 
her future motherinlaw shiela edwards burst into tears when she 
saw annie model it in the store 
but the dress cost far more than annie had planned on spending 
so she sketched it from memory and had a dressmaker recreate it 
in choosing this design she followed a style that has long been 
popular among brides 
the bridal dress with layered skirt of tulle or organza attached 
to a fitted plain or beaded bodice is an enduring style says 
rachel leonard fashion editor of brides magazine the bodice may 
have less ornamentation than it did in versions of earlier years 
another perennial is the sculptured cut in which the shape and 
outline of the dress is its most important characteristic there 
may be a peplum or the dress may have an enormous ballgown skirt 
and a portrait neckline 
over the past few years brides have been exercising more 
individuality in dressing as the number of available styles has 
increased leonard discerns two strong directions some brides 
dress daringly while others choose the demure coveredup styles 
of tradition 
wellknown couture designers like arnold scaasi and carolina 
herrera have injected a sophisticated stylishness to many wedding 
dress designs in the vanguard are very short dresses these may 
have a detachable overskirt or train in longer lengths bare 
shoulders and low necklines which once would have been 
unthinkable now are often found in wedding dresses 
traditional lace has been reemerging as a favored bridal dress 
material and if the bride doesnt have an ancestor who obligingly 
left her an heirloom gown she can shop for one in an antiques 
store 
at least three stores in new york city carry old bridal dresses 
and there are similar stores in other parts of the country 
according to leonard the dresses usually have been cleaned and 
reconditioned and can be altered to fit 
ann lawrence antiques in new york for example stocks more than 
500 antique dresses and new dresses constructed of antique 
materials lawrence says she sells dresses priced from 500 to 
15000 to brides all over the country 
to find antique bridal dresses she advises contacting the 
curator of a museum costume collection or a local antiques dealers 
association who would be likely to know costume specialists who 
handle these dresses 
its often hard to tell how much a dress might have cost 
brides magazine says the average price paid for a bridal dress is 
794 prices can range from about 250 to 20000 
the best buys in terms of sophisticated styles fine fabrics 
and hand detailing are found in dresses that cost between 1200 to 
1600 says leonard 
dresses under 700 are more likely to be informal in style and 
of synthetic rather than real silk however the bride wont have 
to sacrifice beading which is being done inexpensively in the far 
east 
the choice and stylishness of bridesmaids dresses has come a 
long way too says leonard sheer fabrics in prints look 
appropriate with the light and airy wedding dresses which are 
popular now 
short is a big trend in bridesmaids dresses both because of 
the influence of shorter skirts in fashion generally and because it 
is a young and fresh look which most bridal attendants look good 
in says leonard and these dresses usually can be worn again 
popular color choices are pink which is flattering to most 
people and blue the black and white and allwhite wedding color 
schemes continue to be popular 
matched outfits are still the rule if there are several 
bridesmaids but anything goes in terms of style and color says 
gerard monaghan director of the association of bridal consultants 
in new milford conn but considerations of the bridesmaids figure 
type and complexion are more important than ditating an unbecoming 
style simply to match a theme he says and more bridesmaids 
dresses are being bought off the rack in retail shops rather than 
from bridal specialists 
dresses worn by mothers of the bridal pair usually are 
coordinated to the wedding style and complement but do not match 
each other 
mens attire is geared toward the degree of formality and time 
of day elegance and appropriateness are the two most important 
considerations according to leonard novelty bow ties and vests 
are a way to give the groom and his attendants a personal 
signature theres a trend to coordinate the mens cummerbunds and 
ties with the bridesmaids dresses often the grooms attire is 
differentiated from his attendants by an unusual tie and 
cummerbund novelty fabrics such as shadow stripe or textured 
suiting are being used and the cropped jacket known as a spencer 
continues to be popular among younger men

the invitation sets the tone for the wedding to come so its 
not surprising that there are new styles in invitations to go along 
with changes in weddings 
couples who are paying for and organizing their own wedding 
often rewrite the standard wording form they also may choose 
something more colorful than the traditional blackinkonecru 
stock 
handwritten or computergenerated calligraphy original artwork 
such as a caricature of the couple or a floral design may be 
reproduced on the invitations handmade paper a scroll with 
antique lettering or a box instead of an envelope are among some 
ideas being used 
people who come to us want something different not the 
standard engraved invitations says barbara logan of rockville 
md who markets a line of invitations in which rose or cornflower 
petals queen annes lace or bits of lace fabric are impregnated in 
handmade paper in pink violet blue cream or white the 
invitation itself is printed on a parchment sheet inserted under 
the decorative cover with ribbon or tassel 
logan says many brides are coordinating invitations reply cards 
and thankyou notes to the weddings color theme prices for floral 
petal paper invitations start at 4 and go up to 6 for the lace 
they are sold at craft shops and stationery stores across the 
country for information call 1 8004589143 
its also possible to send out a wedding invitation in a plastic 
wine or champagne bottle says elaine barker owner of paper 
potpourri in haverhill mass the unbreakable bottle can be sent 
through the mail with a 45 or 85cent stamp depending on its 
size 
one recent order she handled was for 150 invitations screened 
with a watercolor with response cards and notes for gift 
thankyous cost was about 1000 she says 
reproducing a penandink sketch on the invitation might cost 
about 2 for each invitation plus 150 for the original drawing 
in line with this new trend annie chervin of south salem ny 
created her own invitation she drew a caricature of herself and 
her groom justin edwards in wedding attire for the cover and 
designed a map with directions to the wedding location for the back 
of the invitation she wrote out the text in her own clear 
longhand 
i experimented with unconventional wording but went back to 
the traditional wording because i felt this would please both sets 
of parents she says 
since she knew how to prepare the necessary mechanical 
finished drawings and text she was able to deliver cameraready 
material to the printer ordering and paying for 100 invitations 
she was pleasantly surprised to receive 150 the cost of 120 was 
well below the 286 which according to brides magazine is the 
average spent on invitations announcements and thankyou notes 
annie saved money by asking guests to reply by telephone instead of 
including a reply card to be mailed 
despite innovations dont write off the traditional engraved 
invitation its alive and well says dina clason senior 
stationery buyer at tiffanys in new york 
being tiffanys we are of course extremely traditional we 
used to see more demand for unusual invitations but these days 
people dont want to stand out and be unique and different 
in one respect tiffanys has bent the rules technically a 
reply card isnt correct and we fought them for a long time but 
americans do not reply without them she says 
the cost of a traditionalsize engraved invitation at tiffanys 
is 365 for 100 reception cards are 148 and reply cards and 
envelopes add 260 more clason says most people order informal 
note paper for thankyou notes but she recommends regular 
stationery with the new name or monogram since it will have many 
more uses

a wedding you plan yourself is unique but that quality of 
originality is what makes it typical says barbara tober editor of 
brides magazine 
so the wedding of justin edwards and annie chervin was unique to 
them of course but typical 
the desire to make a wedding personal in all its aspects is 
paramount today all the elements from ethnic customs to what 
they wear and what they eat and how they travel to the ceremony 
are being considered and personal choices are being made says 
tober 
no less important is having the people they regard as family 
present at the wedding today a couple wants to make a connection 
with family in whatever way they can not everyone has a big 
family or they may have given up on their relatives but want to 
include those who are meaningful 
todays weddings are traditional in that people send 
invitations make vows have a meal cut a cake have toasts and go 
on a honeymoon what is different now is that there are so many 
choices in every one of these activities many couples have an 
essentially traditional service but they may add to or modify it 
observes tober 
the wedding dress can have a handkerchief hem be ballet 
length or have a cathedral train and four types of beads or be a 
simple dress or a lace suit theres every neckline every kind of 
fabric 
flowers from grape hyacinths and miniature tussy mussies to 
roses and gardenias 
cakes can be the traditional tiered white cake or have a 
different flavor in every layer some people choose custommade 
replicas of themselves the honeymoon can be a long weekend in the 
poconos or a trip to india or africa says tober 
or it can be an adventure in the waters off the coast of turkey 
on a small sailboat with your new inlaws as was annie and 
justins delayed summer honeymoon trip

wedding etiquette once practically carved in stone is now 
written on the wind 
just for starters the bridal couple may have been living 
together before the wedding the groom may have selected a woman as 
his honor attendant while the maid of honor is a man the bride 
may walk down the aisle on the arms of both her father and her 
stepfather or with her mother the wedding service may be 
conducted by two members of the clergy each of a different 
denomination 
the nicest thing that has happened is that weddings have 
become more individual says elizabeth post granddaughter of 
emily post who kept earlier generations manners in order we 
have many more choices today people check in etiquette books to 
see what is considered proper and then modify it to suit 
themselves says post who recently revised emily posts 
complete book of wedding etiquette 
still she discerns a growing interest in observing the forms 
after an era in which many people wanted to eliminate them in the 
interest of spontaneity and freedom 
compared to the 1970s and the 1960s people want more 
structure but without returning to the formality that 
characterized the victorian age says post 
or as annie chervin edwards who was married in south salem 
ny last spring puts it i didnt want my wedding to be stuffy 
but i didnt want anything to be in bad taste either 
although she didnt plan on observing traditions such as having 
a receiving line she says that one materialized naturally after 
the ceremony as guests came up to congratulate the couple and their 
parents 
etiquette today is changing to accommodate feelings which is 
only right since it evolved as ritualized courtesy which is a form 
of kindness says barbara tober editor of brides magazine 
some practices now considered appropriate once either frowned 
on or not considered include sharing expenses between both sets 
of parents closing the bar early or even doing without alcoholic 
beverages altogether inviting livein mates as well as spouses of 
friends and addressing invitations to a husband and wife who dont 
share the same last name brides reports 
if receiving lines and other rituals are no longer a matter of 
concern what questions of etiquette most concern those planning 
weddings today 
the toughest questions are those having to do with the roles of 
stepparents and divorced parents in the wedding followed closely 
by those about second weddings says post 
a common question who gives the bride away tradition says 
its her own fathers prerogative but this can lead to hurt 
feelings if she has been living with her mother and stepfather for 
many years many brides are writing to ask if their mother can give 
them away i say yes even though there may be some raised 
eyebrows if that is what the bride would like a mothers place 
traditionally is in the front row but if a stepmother has been 
more important in the brides or grooms life she is the one who 
should be given this seat of honor says post 
issues having to do with money frequently are raised i dont 
think that guests should be asked to give a certain sum or to 
contribute to the wedding reception wedding gifts should not be 
related to the elaborateness of the reception but to what the donor 
wishes to give and can afford 
another issue thats more common these days is how to handle a 
ceremony between people of different religions when a joint 
ceremony incorporating each faith is impossible there can be two 
services on the same day usually one of them is just for the 
immediate family post concludes

nice ice as someone inevitably will say as you show off your 
new engagement ring but getting the nicest within your budget may 
require a hardheaded break in your romantic reveries as you 
approach what probably is your first major investment as a couple 
this major purchase doesnt have to be overwhelming and it 
wont be if you know how to go about it says antoinette matlins 
a gem expert and industry editor she and antonio bonnano a 
leading gemologist and appraiser are coauthors of engagement 
and wedding rings the definitive buying guide for people in love 
gemstone press south woodstock vt 
the choices can be intimidating there are countless colored 
gemstones diamonds and settings in various grades styles and 
sizes all affecting the price she notes 
the traditional diamond apparently remains the favorite the 
american diamond industry association estimates that 76 percent of 
all brides in 1989 received diamond engagement rings what is 
especially meaningful is that despite the nations economic 
concerns the number of diamond engagement rings sold has 
increased says lloyd jaffe chairman of the industry group he 
cites an 8 percent increase for that period with an average 
selling price of 1357 and 42 percent of purchases costing less 
than 1000 
weight cut color and clarity are the main points to consider 
in judging diamond quality say most gem specialists but your own 
taste and budget are legitimate considerations too 
can you tell the difference between a 90point and full 1carat 
stone most people cant when the stones are set ms matlins says 
but this small differencein weight there are 100 points to the 
carat can make a big difference in cost since the price goes up 
significantly when a stone weighs a carat or more 
she adds that if size is important to you consider a 
pearshaped or marquiseshaped diamond the round brilliantcut 
diamond is considered to be the one that maximizes the stones 
beauty but this cut also tends to look smaller than those in other 
shapes 
more important than size is the cut says marcee feinberg of 
lazare kaplan international a diamond jewelry firm you may 
choose to economize on color clarity or size but to ensure you 
have the most brilliant diamond possible you should never 
compromise on cut 
the cut shapes the stone into facets or angled planes to 
maximize fire color and brilliance light 
the most expensive stones are very white if these are beyond 
your budget youll find that less white stones will look whiter 
when set in white gold or platinum advises ms matlins most 
diamonds have a slight coloring 
flawless diamonds are rare but the stone doesnt have to be 
perfect to have high value and beauty she says a slightly 
imperfect stone with fine color and brilliance may be more 
satisfying than a perfect stone with less sparkle and color 
designs other than the solitaire may be equally or more 
beautiful but often cost less she adds some suggestions 
consider using several smaller diamonds instead of one large 
one a 1carat round brilliant cut diamond in a solitaire setting 
might cost about 5000 while a ring with three stones with the 
same total weight may cost 2500 and one with seven diamonds with 
the same total weight 1500 
bold designs in gold or platinum using wide innovative 
designs can add importance to smaller diamonds 
use small diamonds to accent a ring with a birthstone the 
birthstone adds even more personal symbolism and it makes a more 
affordable ring 
ms matlins book covers other factors in making your selection 
she explains why cut and proportion are the most important factors 
in the stones beauty and tells how to spot a faulty cutting she 
tells how to read a diamond grading report how to steer clear of 
bargains that may be fraudulent and how to personalize and 
protect an inherited heirloom ring 
she also includes a history of engagement rings

with the revival of fullscale formal weddings comes the return 
of another romantic extravagance the trousseau 
our trousseau business is phenomenal says nicole muller 
who with her mother gloria runs lingerie de nicolle an upscale 
boutique on new yorks madison avenue not a day goes by that 
someone doesnt ask about a trousseau 
business is so brisk that they have started a bridal registry 
service so that close friends and relatives can select preferred 
items for the bride in her right size our bridal registry is 
the response to increased demand for bridal lingerie and also to 
the need for the bride and her entire wedding party to juggle this 
consideration with the dozens of other details involved in wedding 
planning says gloria muller 
trousseau is derived from the french word for bundle and 
usually refers to the brides clothes and linens often collected 
in a hope chest 
to the mullers this means lacy silk and satin bras panties 
garters gowns robes and slippers traditionally in white or 
ivory but also in pastels and occasionally black accessories 
include the goodluck garter satin slippers to be worn for comfort 
at the reception as well as with sleepwear padded satin lingerie 
hangers and a lacy laundry bag for the delicate lingerie 
others may prefer easycare versions made of patina or captiva 
two nylon luxury fabrics by allied designer fernando sanchez uses 
these in brilliant hues for lingerie and athome wear while 
lingerie makers such as lily of france lorraine gilligan amp 
omalley val mode cine star chic and others interpret 
traditionally glamorous designs in these fabrics 
for an elegant touch trim pillows in fabrics and embroidery to 
match the robes in your trousseau suggests holly lueders a 
lingerie designer she recommends packing several robes among the 
sheets slips and sachet one thats elegantly embroidered 
another thats sheer and one for real comfort dress designer and 
antiques dealer ann lawrence advises the bride to devise her own 
version of a hope chest perhaps an old cedar chest or steamer 
trunk to collect lingerie and linens theres something about old 
things she says that gives a comfortable feeling of enduring 
tradition 
most of those frilly athome clothes robes nightgowns 
lacetrimmed or embroidered teddies camisoles slips bras 
panties and hosiery can go right into the automatic washer 
advises maytag 
just make sure you launder smaller loads than usual separately 
using the delicate cycle and at least a medium water level wash 
nylon separately to avoid picking up color from other fabric and 
if the fabric is a blend wash it as though it were 100 percent of 
the dominant fiber use either warm water with a regular detergent 
or cold water with a liquid or predissolved detergent to 
discourage fading of brilliant colors only oxygen bleaches should 
be used to treat silk wood spandex noncolorfast and some 
flameretardant materials put hosiery in a pillowcase or mesh bag 
to prevent snags and also use a separate bag for garters bras and 
other garments with hardware that might catch on other items add 
fabric softener during the final rinse tumble dry on the low or 
warm setting and remove promptly 
silk actually a very strong fiber also can be machine 
laundered even if its care label is marked hand wash use a 
gentle cycle and slow agitation speed and a twominute wash cycle 
hang silks on plastic hangers and if the item requires pressing 
do so while the fabric is still damp 
and if you spill champagne caviar or chocolate on your 
honeymoon clothes refer to maytags stain removal guide which 
costs 50 cents in coin from the maytag company consumer

melting pot or smorgasbord the united states is a place where 
ethnic and religious diversity abound the volatile mixture can be 
champagne or a witches brew for a couple with different backgrounds 
who fall in love and want to marry 
the number of mixed marriages has grown steadily since 1910 
says tom w smith director of the general social survey at the 
national opinion research center a nonprofit social science 
research center at the university of chicago 
among married people born between 1960 and 1970 335 percent 
were raised in a different religion from their spouse thats 
almost double the 18 percent born before 1910 whose birth religion 
differed from their spouses 
the numbers show an orderly progression with greater 
intermarriage in each decade and theres a similar pattern in 
marriages between spouses of different ethnic makeup however the 
incidence of blackwhite intermarriage is extremely small 
as mixed marriages have grown more common americans have become 
more accepting of them when asked by the gallup poll whether they 
approved of marriage between catholics and protestants 79 percent 
said yes in 1983 the latest figures available compared to 63 
percent in 1968 
the approval rates for marriage between jews and nonjews show a 
similar growth in 1983 77 percent of the gallup poll respondents 
said yes compared to 59 percent in 1968 
another indication of growing tolerance says smith is that 
laws forbidding interracial marriage today are found nowhere in the 
country as late as the 1960s about 20 states had them on their 
books 
its easier than it used to be for couples of mixed religion to 
have a religious ceremony according to smith 
within the catholic church only the catholic spouse has to 
promise to raise the children as catholics formerly both 
individuals had to make this promise in order to be married in the 
church he says the change occurred in the 1960s 
although official jewish rabbinical groups still have a policy 
against officiating at interfaith marriages and conservative and 
orthodox rabbis do not perform such ceremonies reform rabbis are 
free to follow their own philosophy says dru greenwood associate 
director of the commission on jewish outreach in new york 
its our policy to reach out to interfaith couples and to 
welcome them without requiring conversion while still encouraging 
them to choose judaism for their children adds greenwood about 
40 percent of current jewish weddings are with a nonjewish 
partner 
if you are looking for a rabbi to coofficiate with a 
christian that remains fairly difficult she says however some 
reform rabbis will do this others will help a couple write a 
ceremony will counsel them and will attend the wedding even if 
they wont officiate 
in interfaith marriages we usually need twice as many 
premarital sessions says canon joel gibson at the cathedral of 
st john the divine in new york the concerns which invariably come 
up include personal religious beliefs relations with the families 
how children will be raised and how holidays will be celebrated 
interfaith marriages can work so long as the couple talk about 
the issues says jay t rock director of christianjewish 
relations at the national council of churches of christ in new 
york 
sometimes in the flush of a new relationship couples enter an 
interfaith marriage with the idea that it doesnt mean anything 
they find out when kids come along at holiday times or when there 
is a funeral that the difference in background does play a part 
counseling on a group or individual basis is very helpful 
rock says counseling can help couples learn how to deal with 
their families who may have wellknown or unsuspected prejudices 
that come to the fore when a marriage with someone from another 
tradition looms 
the workshops i know about try to talk about the various 
options but i think there is often an underlying message that 
conversion rather than living with differences is best for children 
and the couple but there is no way to erase your past even if you 
convert your children will be curious about this part of their 
tradition 
though still limited the resources for interfaith couples have 
grown to find out about counseling programs and clergy who conduct 
interfaith marriages rock suggests calling a local ecumenical 
group like the national conference of christians and jews however 
most couples find out about the resources by word of mouth 
a discussion program called times and seasons a liberal 
jewish perspective on intermarriage is available in many parts of 
the country according to greenwood for further information 
contact the union of american hebrew congregations at 838 fifth 
ave new york ny 10021 or check with a local reform 
synagogue 
one of the first problems that interfaith couples have is 
introducing each other to their parents says barbara tober editor 
of brides magazine 
sometimes the parents wont come to the wedding in the main 
the stories we hear are of a traumatic first meeting which most of 
the time gets resolved and very often they say now they love him 
or her

if you think a prenuptial agreement is unromantic think how 
unromantic a nasty battle in divorce court would be later 
prenups give couples an opportunity to review their assets 
and be honest with one another says richard plotka a 
matrimonial lawyer in new york city thats a good way to start a 
partnership 
its better to deal with touchy issues when youre in love he 
says and since the contracts usually start with a complete 
disclosure of assets and debts it could save you from some 
uncomfortable surprises 
ive seen many prospective spouses rudely discover their 
partners are saddled with budgetcrunching debt or hiding sizable 
wealth says plotka 
prenuptial agreements in the united states are more common 
among second or later marriages or couples marrying later in life 
he points out thats simply because at this stage couples are 
likely to be bringing more tangible assets to the marriage like a 
coop or house a car a business or a professional degree 
but young people marrying for the first time can protect their 
assets with an agreement he says this is especially true of young 
women who may have slowed or hindered their careers by taking time 
off to have children even if she hasnt had a child and the 
marriage ends early a young woman usually fares better with a 
prenuptial agreement 
these agreements if properly done will hold up in court 
plotka says they can spell out property distribution terms of 
support and even what religion the children should be taught they 
can protect the things youve worked hard for and they can make a 
fair distribution of assets developed during the marriage 
assets that usually appreciate in value include stocks a family 
business and real estate these issues can be covered in an 
agreement plotka says since some state laws allow for 
appreciation of separate property to become jointly owned in some 
circumstances 
another factor to consider is the application in most states of 
the recent equitable distribution laws which give courts 
discretion about division of assets acquired during a marriage 
before these laws were in effect homes bank accounts and 
businesses usually were held in the husbands name it was assumed 
that the woman would be compensated with alimony now the courts 
can decide whats fair and are no longer compelled to leave 
ownership to the title holder 
plotka acknowledges that making up an agreement may take away 
from the optimism and excitement of a wedding so he advises 
couples to work out an agreement well before the wedding day each 
partner should have his or her own lawyer 
my advice is to work out an agreement based upon whats fair 
sign it and put it away do this well in advance of the wedding so 
that there is plenty of time for tension to dissipate then go out 
have a wonderful wedding and have a long and happy future 
together perhaps the agreement will never need to be used

tempers may flare and patience wear thin on that 
special occasion your wedding day 
weddings are almost like a crisis situation says donna j 
rankin associate professor of community and mental health nursing 
at loyola university in chicago 
youve never done this before and multiple decisions large 
and small must be made in a relatively short period of time there 
are almost certainly going to be conflicts 
just about anything can create conflict on the wedding day she 
says from the color of the wedding dress to the type of band or 
music being played 
but its all survivable 
the key to a successful and happy wedding is to resolve 
conflicts as they occur says rankin be honest about your 
feelings but dont be afraid to compromise 
solving conflicts on the wedding day may not be easy but the 
important part is to start with an open mind not a confrontational 
stance she says 
look for the winwin situation something that satisfies both 
parties a bride and groom that i knew came from distinctly 
different religions their solution was two ceremonies one from 
each faith both families were pleased 
its a day of great expectations she says for bride groom 
family and friends 
while everybody wants their dream wedding remember 
perfection isnt always possible 
strive to reduce stress levels by using conflict resolution 
techniques a wedding is only the first day of a marriage youll 
have the rest of your lives together

you can strengthen your marriage by not 
expecting to agree with your partner on everything and by learning 
to manage those differences constructively says a family 
counseling specialist 
happy couples are those who have learned to communicate 
negotiate and compromise more skillfully says clifford notarious 
codirector of the catholic university of americas marriage and 
family studies group 
he adds that its how the couple deals with differences rather 
than the differences themselves that affects the stability of their 
marriage 
he offers these guidelines to help couples communicate 
successfully 
speak only for yourself not for your partner 
communicate or argue as if it were a game with rules not a 
freeforall 
separate the discussion of the problem from the solution 
dont rush to a solution 
choose one topic to talk about and stick to it dont stack 
problems 
be polite maintain selfcontrol 
dont blame the conflict on your partner consider causes that 
he or she may have little control over 
if your partner makes a negative comment dont respond 
negatively 
set a time for talking about problems 
set relationship rules dont hash things out in front of the 
children or at the end of a hard day when either partner may be 
tired or edgy 
show your partner you care about what he or she has to say 
dont just say i understand but demonstrate it by facial 
expressions and body language

single men looking for a raise or promotion should consider a 
serious option get married 
married men earn an average of 306 percent more than unmarried 
men according to a university of michigan survey 
husbands outearn bachelors in several other countries as well 
said robert schoeni a doctoral student at the schools population 
studies center in ann arbor mich 
the average earnings of married men were consistently higher 
than the earnings of their unmarried counterparts in all the 
countries we studied the effect persisted even when education age 
or experience and race were taken into account schoeni said 
he thinks possible reasons are that employers perceive married 
men as more stable and communityoriented that women tend to marry 
financially successful men and that men feel more responsible and 
therefore are more productive 
schoeni studied incomes in 12 countries using data for 25 to 
64yearold males collected since 1983 by the center for 
population poverty and policy studies in walferdange luxembourg 
he said he found marriage had a particularly powerful effect on 
mens earnings in the united states norway sweden and 
switzerland 
longdistance calls and travel fares often need to be figured 
into wedding expenses according to modern bride whose 
decemberjanuary issue looks at the phenomenon of what it calls 
longdistance weddings the mobility of people today makes it 
unlikely that youll meet marry and settle down in your old home 
town the magazine says the publication advises you plan far in 
advance so relatives and friends in distant cities will have a 
better chance to come provide travel information arrange blocks 
of hotel rooms at discounted rates and try to keep costs to a 
minimum for participants and guests

is the only thing standing between you and a beautiful wedding 
the fact that you havent found the suitable groom 
the odds arent as great as you may think even if youre an 
older woman says barbara lovenheim author of beating the 
marriage odds when you are smart single and over 35 william 
morrow 
lovenheim reviews the statistics from a variety of sources 
including the bennettbloom report of several years ago which 
concluded that women over 40 had only a 13 percent chance of 
marrying and the national center for health statistics figures 
which show that a 40yearold woman has a 24 percent chance 
for one thing the statistics show that a womans marital 
probabilities really do decline as she ages that is a fact 
lovenheim writes the bright side of these statistics is that a 
large number of women can and do marry at every age a 
f40yearold single woman can find a husband and so can a 52old 
single woman a 38yearold divorced woman may find a new spouse 
and a 49yearold divorced woman is not at all out of the 
running

newspaper prices appear to be going up as 
publishers pummeled by declining growth in advertising look to 
their readers for money to shore up profits 
dow jones amp co inc provided the most prominent example of what 
appears to be a trend toward higher prices by boosting the cover 
price of its flagship newspaper the wall street journal by 50 
percent to 75 cents this month 
but judging from presentations made to the annual painewebber 
media outlook conference this past week others may not be far 
behind 
affiliated publications inc for instance plans to boost the 
price of the daily issues of the boston globe sold more than 30 
miles outside the city to 50 cents from 35 cents this spring 
chairman william taylor said prices on issues sold closer to the 
city may be increased if conditions warrant 
the washington post is boosting the price for delivery of the 
sunday edition to 150 from 125 early next year 
several knightridder inc newspapers are planning to boost 
cover prices 
without identifying the papers by name president p anthony 
ridder said three of the companys 29 newspapers will boost daily 
cover prices to 35 cents a copy from 25 cents while three others 
will go to 50 cents from 35 cents 
this past friday the new york times said it was boosting its 
home delivery price by 50 cents to 5 for monday through sunday 
delivery in the new york metropolitan area and the northeast 
starting jan 1 some other delivery rates also go up 
several other media companies told securities analysts they 
intended to follow an aggressive circulation pricing policy 
publishers generally shy away from boosting prices for readers 
because they fear increases will mean fewer people will subscribe 
or pick up the paper at newsstands their concern is not only that 
they will lose out on some circulation revenue but that 
advertisers will cut back because their sales pitches reach a 
smaller audience 
but j kendrick noble jr media analyst for painewebber said 
many newspapers may find they can still keep a big audience after 
raising prices 
he said his examination of pricing trends suggests that 
newspapers that boost prices by no more than 2 percentage points 
more than the inflation rate tend to lose less than 1 percent of 
their circulation 
its not as bad as newspapers might think he said 
the conditions that are driving many newspapers to consider 
circulation price increases include the weakest environment for 
advertising since the mid70s and the prospect of newsprint price 
increases next year 
robert coen the chief forecaster for the advertising agency 
mccannerickson said he expects ad spending will rise 49 percent 
this year the slowest rate of gain since 1975 and advance by only 
46 percent in 1991 
major newsprint producers meanwhile have proposed 5 percent 
price increases for early next year 
jack butcher circulation director at the tampa fla tribune 
said he senses more movement toward higher prices 
he said he recently surveyed companies who make the coinslot 
plates that are fitted on newspaper vending machines and said they 
reported they have the highest level of orders for new plates in 
years 
that is usually a leading indicator of newspaper price changes 
and he said the plates are being readied to accommodate price 
hikes 
butcher said he expects daily prices will average 35 cents next 
year up from 30 cents this year and that sunday prices will rise 
to 1 from 75 cents 
he said he expects readers will be willing to pay mre because 
of the improvements that papers have made in recent years such as 
beefing up local coverage using flashier graphics to illustrate 
stories and introducing colors to make the papers look more 
appealing 
those changes help minimize the risk of a price hike he 
said

the once imposing empire of john c portman jr 
is gradually changing as the architectdeveloper surrenders control 
of various hotels office towers and other properties in a 
wideranging debt restructuring 
the atrium pioneer insists however that his operation remains 
fundamentally strong and the recent giveups are part of 
acclimating to changing economic times 
portman developed peachtree center a network of fortresslike 
skyscrapers and splashy hotels that anchor the northern end of 
atlantas downtown business district 
his atlantabased portman cos is a private company and he has 
made few public statements since he began negotiations in august 
with about 20 creditors to restructure a debt load that reportedly 
nears 2 billion portman declined to be personally interviewed for 
this story but he responded through a spokesman to a series of 
general questions 
any of these giveups are very minor in comparison to the 
overall portfolio portman said while you are reading about 
certain transactions these are very minor and part of an orderly 
process behind the scenes 
there has been an economic downturn and changing federal 
lending regulations in real estate specifically these changes 
are the new reality for the next few years 
the crux of portmans talks with the lenders has been a plan to 
convert unsecured loans those not backed by collateral into a 
pool that would be backed by various portman assets including some 
of his properties 
over the last few months portman has 
agreed to turn over ownership of much of peachtree center 
complex to equitable life assurance society of the united states 
and nippon life insurance co which held a 3326 million mortgage 
on eight buildings the portman cos continue to manage the 
properties under the deal a wholesale trade mart and hotel that 
also are part of the complex were not included in the deal with 
equitable 
given up a 475 million tract of land in downtown atlanta 
near portmans underconstruction one peachtree center office 
tower to american realty trust 
agreed to increase equitables stake in inforum an atlanta 
technology mart and trade show facility that originally was a 5050 
partnership between the two companies neither side has disclosed 
details of the agreement beyond stating that portman has a 
contract to lease and manage the facility 
turned over to ncnb corp the suburban atlanta snapfinger woods 
industrial park the north carolina bank held a 62 million 
mortgage on the property which was portmans only warehouse 
project 
sold to atlanta developer thomas g cousins an 11acre site in 
the citys brookhaven neighborhood planned for a highrise 
development 
earlier this year portman sold the portman san francisco a 
3yearold luxury hotel for an undisclosed price 
portman also has had to deal with a humiliating barrage of news 
coverage of his financial problems in his hometown where he 
previously enjoyed regular praise for helping shape the citys 
skyline and cosmopolitan image aside from occasional sniping at 
the atlanta newspapers though portman has remained publicly 
philosophical about the downturn 
i have taken a lot of risks in my life he said through the 
spokesman with that comes the possibility of rough times as well 
as good times 
the worst is behind us we are very hopeful all the final 
documents with the lenders will be signed within six to eight 
weeks 
much of portmans problems stem from actions taken during the 
last three years when he forged ahead with a roster of ambitious 
projects borrowing huge sums of money and refinancing existing 
projects to foot the costs 
he continued this approach even as the economy began to decline 
he also suffered from events out of his control for example the 
tianenman square masacre focused the worlds scorn on china as he 
raced to complete a major chinese project 
the problemplagued shanghai center a spectacular office and 
hotel complex finally opened in october one of portmans few 
bright spots this year 
he continues to predict great things for one peachtree center 
projected to be the tallest office building in the south which is 
going up at the rate of one floor every four days 
though downtown atlanta is experiencing a high office vacancy 
rate portman officials contend there will be sufficient demand for 
space by the time one peachtree center opens in 1992 
he portman feels more fortunate than others who dont have 
the same quality properties said spokesman peter mathon these 
are very premium assets he will survive better than most

american telephone amp telegraph co plans to 
start a proxy fight to wrest control of ncr corps board of 
directors as it tries to buy the computer maker for 61 billion 
atampt announced it would try to oust the directors three days 
after ncrs board unanimously rejected a 90pershare cash tender 
offer from the phone company 
the move to unseat the board was widely seen as atampts logical 
next step after ncr rejected the offer and amended a lawsuit 
alleging that atampts securities and exchange commission filings for 
its tender offer violate federal securities law 
walter murphy atampt spokesman said the company wants ncr 
shareholders to elect a new board of directors that would negotiate 
with atampt and remove ncrs antitakeover provisions 
atampt will seek proxies for a special shareholder meeting and for 
the regular annual meeting scheduled for april 17 to force ncr to 
call a special stockholder meeting atampt has to get holders of at 
least 25 percent of ncrs stock to request a meeting 
it would be up to ncr to set a date for a special meeting said 
dick gray another atampt spokesman 
atampt plans to file details of its proxy solicitation with the 
sec monday morning gray said atampt extended the expiration date 
for its offer by 11 days to january 15 
charles e exley jr chairman of dayton ohiobased ncr the 
nations fifthlargest computer maker has said he would be willing 
to talk to atampt about a buyout if the phone company raised its 
offer to 125 per share or about 85 billion atampt has said the 
higher price is outrageous 
mark feighery ncr spokesman said sunday the company would have 
no immediate comment on atampts move 
exley has said it would not make sense to combine ncrs 
wellregarded computer line with atampts disappointing computer 
business he said he would quit ncr if atampt suceeded in its 
takeover 
so far ncr has followed a socalled just say no defense in 
which a target companys board rejects a takeover offer even if 
the shareholders like the bid to move the deal forward 
shareholders would have to remove the board or atampt would have to 
negotiate a deal with ncr 
atampt launched its tender offer on dec 5 after ncrs board 
turned down an atampt offer to exchange 90 worth of its stock for 
each ncr share 
ncr stock fell 150 a share friday to close at 8862 in new 
york stock exchange trading atampt shares fell 37 cents to 3062

with the nations economy in a big slump the 
government fund that insures bank deposits is under stress and 
needs more money to cope with bank failures the chairman says 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corporation said the fund is expected to pay out 4 billion in 
1990 to cover bank losses 
a new forecast for 1991 looks like another 5 billion loss 
he said that would push the fdics reserves down to 4 billion he 
said 
seidman also said a report being released at a congressional 
hearing today is useful because it underscores the problems in the 
troubled banking system 
but he said some of the reports dire conclusions are based on 
forecasts that may prove to be wrong 
it shows that as our numbers show that were under stress 
and that we need more funds he said on nbcs meet the press 
on sunday 
seidman was to testify at todays hearing by the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions the panels report says 
bank failures could cost the fdic 63 billion over three years if 
there is a severe recession 
even a mild downturn would leave the fund short of cash said 
the report which was written by three economists the associated 
press obtained a copy of the economists summary last week 
seidman said the 63 billion figure was at the high end of the 
scale of potential outcomes our own figures show that even if we 
took their highest number with the recapitalization well have 
over 50 billion in hand to meet that so at worst there would be a 
small additional amount needed to be borrowed from the treasury 
he said 
the bankers will recapitalize the fdic by paying more premiums 
into it seidman said we think they have plenty of resources to 
do that and we expect that they will agree that thats the way it 
ought to be done 
a banking industry official said in a televised interview today 
that banks are committed to making sure the fund remains solvent 
if it needs to be recapitalized the banks are willing to put 
the necessary money into the fund donald ogilvie executive vice 
president of the american bankers association said during an 
appearance on nbctvs today show 
the economists report suggests the insurance fund be cushioned 
with a loan from the treasury 
meantime seidman said he agreed with other bush administration 
officials that the economy is in a downturn 
were in the beginning of what may be a recession he said 
we have to wait and see 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said the economy is undergoing 
a significant slowdown that is likely to persist through early 
1991 before turning around later next year 
i have been a little slow to declare national recession day 
brady said 
asked why he was reluctant to use the word recession brady said 
sunday he did not have all the figures for the quarter 
lets watch and see brady said maybe it will be i dont 
think its the end of the world even if we have a recession well 
pull back out of it again no big deal 
many private economists however have pronounced the economy in 
recession with layoffs rising and banks in trouble and with the 
retail sales housing and car markets down a recession is defined 
as a contraction of six months or more in the gross national 
product 
i think it is quite clear that economic activity in the fourth 
quarter of this year has slowed down brady said on meet the 
press he added i expect that that will continue into the 
first quarter of this year 
we expect that during 1991 that it the economy will turn 
around and well be back on the growth path jobs investment 
during that year he said 
bush administration officials blamed the persian gulf crisis for 
aggravating the downturn by jacking up oil prices and sapping 
consumer confidence 
i am obviously concerned about events in the persian gulf 
said michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of 
economic advisers 
i think they have heavily influenced the shortterm impact on 
the economy he said on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley 
moreover boskin said the government might have to borrow money 
to pay for operation desert shield 
congressional democrats say the cost of keeping as many as 
400000 us troops in the gulf could add up to 368 billion in 
fiscal year 1991 the bush administration intends to ask congress 
for 20 billion early next year house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo said saturday

oil production by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries rose nearly 1 million barrels a day 
in november to hit a daily level of 2363 million barrels and is 
expected to increase further the middle east economic survey 
reported monday 
amid continuing war jitters in the gulf the respected oil 
industry newsletter said the increase was partly due to saudi 
arabia hiking its daily production by 530000 barrels to 833 
million barrels 
the saudis are expected to boost output further this month to 
around 863 million barrels a day the nicosiabased newsletter 
said 
the saudi oil ministry has accelerated plans to expand 
production capacity to around 10 million barrels a day in the next 
few years a level last seen in the early 1980s 
the november increase of 970000 barrels a day put opec 
production at its highest level since may when it was 2368 
million barrels a day 
the survey noted that irans production rose in november by 
460000 barrels a day after dipping in october 
irans current production of 346 million barrels a day means 
that iranian production is running at more or less its september 
level 
some of opecs 13 members sharply increased production levels 
after iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 and a united nations trade embargo 
halted all exports of iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
saudi arabia opecs leading producer has more than doubled its 
production since august to help make up the shortfall of around 4 
million barrels day because of the embargo 
oil prices shot up after the iraqi invasion from around 20 to 
22 a barrel to a peak of about 40 a barrel 
prices have since eased to about 27 a barrel but renewed fears 
of war in the gulf between iraq and a usled multinational force 
could send prices rising again 
industry sources reported earlier this month that saudi 
production alone could drop between 1 and 2 million barrels a day 
if war breaks out in the gulf 
the oil ministers of the opec countries agreed in vienna at 
their biannual conference dec1213 that they will continue to set 
aside the organizations production quota system designed to 
stabilize prices until the crisis ends 
the last quota agreement in july shortly before the iraqi 
invasion established a production ceiling of 2249 million barrels 
a day and a minimum price level of 21 a barrel 
mees editor ian seymour noted that the opec ministers did not 
like what they saw in reviewing the gulf crisis and its impact on 
the oil market 
the doomsday scenario under which a devastating war would lead 
to widespread destruction of gulf oil facilities is a grim enough 
prospect seymour said 
but another nightmarish possibility for the oil producers is 
that a less catastrophic resolution to the crisis that is to say 
a peaceful settlement or even a short sharp war without any 
significant damage to oil installations followed by a renewed 
flow of iraqi and kuwaiti oil to the market could result in a 
massive oversupply and consequent collapse in prices to well below 
15 a barrel in the absence of prompt and effective opec action to 
reimpose production controls he said 
the fact is that even without the exports from iraq or 
kuwait oil supply from the other eleven opec members is now quite 
sufficient to meet world needs and could move into surplus by the 
second quarter of next year 
despite the agreement in vienna on an eventual return to the 
quota system seymour said many observers are skeptical about 
the real readiness of the surpluscapacity producers to return to 
quota discipline when the time comes 
the parisbased international energy agency said a week ago that 
the oil market was in a quite manageable balance at present 
following the wild gyrations that followed the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait 
but its monthly report on the oil market noted there remains 
little spare capacity in crude production 
the market could still face serious problems should there be 
industrial accidents prolonged cold weather or other distruptions 
during the winter it said 
the report said that together with a significant drop in soviet 
oil production there were a number of sources of potential 
concern including serious disruption in gulf production if war 
erupts 
the un security council approved a us resolution nov 29 
giving iraq until jan 15 to withdraw from kuwait or risk an 
offensive by the multinational force to liberate the conquered 
emirate 
iraq has so far given no indication it plans to pull out and has 
been steadily boosting its military force in kuwait and southern 
iraq to a current level of around 460000 troops

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
united states has dropped by 28 to 1151 in the latest week the 
toolmaker baker hughes inc reported monday 
the count one year ago was 1079 rigs the company said 
baker hughes has kept the rig count a widely watched index of 
drilling activity since 1940 the count represents the number of 
rigs actively exploring for petroleum not those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
ike kerridge a vice president of baker hughes said he could 
find no particular reason for this weeks drop although the number 
of working rigs usually rises at years end 
some years it peaks earlier in december or maybe it will 
peak next week theres just no way of telling kerridge said 
oklahoma lost the largest number of rigs dropping 11 for the 
week followed by colorado which dropped nine and texas which 
dropped seven 
new mexico led the major oil producing states for the week by 
adding nine rigs to the count followed by north dakota up four

toyota motor corp japans largest automaker 
said monday it will release us sales figures for its imported as 
well as north americanmade vehicles every 10 days 
the company which started the practice last week becomes the 
first japanese automaker to report total sales every 10 days a 
tradition held for decades by general motors corp ford motor co 
and chrysler corp 
however beginning with the first reporting period of january 
chrysler will halt 10day sales reports which it calls useless 
chrysler objects to reporting sales figures every 10 days 
because a wide variety of factors including weather or big 
incentive programs can give a false representation of how a 
companys sales compare with a year ago 
chrysler also said it costs too much to produce the reports 
gm and ford have said they will continue to report us sales of 
their vehicles every 10 days

pie international announced monday 
it will handle freight through the end of the month before a 
bankruptcy trustee begins selling off the assets of the failed 
trucking line 
us bankruptcy judge george proctor approved the companys 
plans saturday to shut down operations and liquidate to pay off the 
companys debts 
we appreciate the support of the thousands of employees and 
customers who made herculean efforts to keep the company going 
gerry mcintyre pie president said in a news release monday 
however the current economy fuel prices and adverse 
publicity associated with our chapter 11 filing prevented us from 
continuing operations he said 
pie has been struggling since it and parent olympia holding 
corp of miami filed for protection from creditors while it 
reorganized under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws two 
months ago it listed debts of 237 million and assets of 169 
million 
prior to the filing pie operated 230 terminals and employed 
3500 workers 800 of them in the companys jacksonville base 
a chapter 11 trustee will be appointed by saturday and will 
begin working dec 29 to begin an orderly liquidation the company 
said 
there was no light at the end of the tunnel said pie 
attorney steve busey the company determined there was no real 
prospect of a successful reorganization 
after two months of downsizing with the elimination of 1500 
jobs and 69 terminals friday pie now employs about 2000 people 
and operates about 100 terminals 
under the courtapproved liquidation plan the company will 
continue operations while it delivers the remaining freight in its 
warehouses 
proctor gave the company permission to use about 8 million from 
cash receipts to pay for wages and operating costs to cover 
deliveries 
pie employees still on the job will receive their regular pay 
and benefits if there is enough money taken in from customers to 
handle those amounts 
the secondphase of the shutdown starts dec 29 when the trustee 
takes over to sell off trucks office equipment and other company 
assets 
the liquidation plan comes after weeks of pressure from anxious 
creditors 
pies biggest creditor fidelcor business credit corp asked 
last month to have the case converted to a chapter 7 liquidation 
because of the truck lines continuing losses pie owes fidelcor 
39 million 
a succession of five owners in five years left the 61yearold 
pie saddled with debt and few assets last year pie lost 24 
million on revenues of 512 million

two of the somber realities of economic life 
recession and high healthcare costs are coming together at just 
the wrong time for many businesses and employees 
consulting firms are recommending that companies scrutinize 
their plans for savings but the historical evidence shows that 
insecurity and other stresses of economic downturns produce greater 
demands on the plans 
for a variety of reasons healthcare utilization and lean 
times go hand in hand says anna rappaport an officer of william 
m mercer inc a leading employee benefits and human resources 
consulting firm 
even layoffs inevitable in a recession can have an impact on 
the cost of health coverage since the consolidated ominibus budget 
act of 1985 requires employees to offer continued coverage to 
terminated workers 
healthcare managers believe some of those former employees may 
use their time to attend to nagging ailments or to undergo surgery 
they had postponed or that financial stress could produce costly 
physical and mental problems 
while the omnibus act popularly and perhaps aptly known as 
cobra in some circles allows employers to charge terminated 
employees the full cost of continued coverage the companies still 
could end up with higher costs 
ms rappaport explains that employees who continue coverage 
often are those most in need typically she says that need might 
involve someone in the family with a mental or physical ailment 
with the result that their coverage costs more than the company is 
allowed to charge the former worker 
still another recessioninduced problem puts pressure on company 
benefit plans older workers and those with chronic ailments may 
seek protection from termination by opting for early retirement or 
by filing a disability claim 
consultants at mercer which serves 9000 domestic employers 
and more if its international operations are included are urging 
clients to reexamine their plans and prepare for the worst but to 
avoid kneejerk solutions 
based on past experience one of the more serious blunders may 
be to slash benefits at the expense of morale and productivity ms 
rappaport a mercer managing director claims that to do so can 
send all the wrong signals 
instead she recommends that companies seek to preserve the 
overall value of benefits and that if it is necessary to shift 
costs to employees then it is also wise to balance this with a 
lowcost addition to the plan 
healthcare costs have been a worsening problem for more than 
two decades consistently rising faster than inflation in general 
by some estimates health care now accounts for about 17 percent of 
gross national product 
at the same time recipients providers insurers employers and 
others agree that much cost is associated with correctible personal 
habits waste duplication and needless usage such as overly long 
hospital stays 
one of the most disturbing consequences of efforts to correct 
any one of these however has been to see costs rise in another 
area savings were sought for example by avoiding or limiting 
hospital stays and it worked for a time but outofhospital costs 
then rose and negated some of those efforts 
in view of such experiences ms rappaport believes there is 
no clean neat solution instead she says the problem must be 
attacked in whatever new ways it rears its ugly head there are 
tradeoffs but not solutions

american airlines gains a gateway to london by 
agreeing to pay 445 million for six of trans world airlines seven 
us routes there 
the seventh route not included in the deal is being negotiated 
separately american spokesman al becker said sunday 
at the same time twa chairman carl icahn renewed his effort to 
acquire pan american world airways which agreed last month to sell 
its london routes to united airlines for 400 million 
if the route sales are approved by the federal government 
united and american will compete for london travel instead of twa 
and pan am which had built their reputations through overseas 
travel pan am will still have routes to londons gatwick airport 
from miami and detroit twa will have none 
the routes twa is selling are between londons heathrow and 
gatwick airports and six us cities new york los angeles 
boston baltimore philadelphia and st louis 
icahn said twa has lost money on the london routes for two 
years 
our current agreements with american will generate additional 
cash liquidity which will enable us to position ourselves for 
growth despite these extremely difficult times he said in a 
statement sunday 
in its renewed bid for pan am twa offered 150 a share in cash 
and 1 a share in either preferred stock or notes for pan ams 150 
million shares outstanding in november twa offered 1 a share in 
cash and 2 in notes 
american already flies to many foreign destinations including 
cities in europe the far east south america and central america 
it hopes to serve heathrow by may and gatwick by november 
this transaction will enable american to become a leading us 
carrier to london and will add tremendous synergy to both the us 
and the uk with many more carrier and destination choices 
american chairman robert l crandall said in a statement 
american also agreed to pay twa 70 million for 40 takeoff and 
landing slots at heathrow and gatwick plus three gates at 
chicagos ohare airport 
in addition fort worthbased american would buy all of twas 
facilities at heathrow and gatwick and hire the airlines 380 
employees in britain 
it also would acquire twa gates in orlando fla and nashville 
tenn and ticket counter space in fort lauderdale fla 
twa is considered one of the financially weakest us carriers 
in november twa inc reported a 146 million loss for the 
third quarter attributed in part to higher fuel prices and 
contractual raises for pilots 
that month icahn offered to buy pan am which is also 
struggling but the proposal went nowhere as pan am proceeded with 
its earlier arrangement for selling its ustolondon routes to 
united 
pan am had no immediate response to icahns latest offer 
we are confirming that we have received his letter and we are 
studying it spokesman jeff kriendler said this morning beyond 
that we have no comment

iran agreed monday to pay 9 
million to a subsidiary of the american oil giant arco the last of 
hundreds of millions of dollars in socalled consortium claims of 
western oil companies against teheran 
the settlement was for expropriation of arcos operations in 
iran during the 1979 islamic revolution that overthrew the regime 
of shah mohammed reza pahlavi 
total compensation to the 14 british french and american oil 
companies in the consortium has amounted to 320 million since 
1982 according to figures broadcast over teheran radio monitored 
in nicosia 
one tribunal official here who asked not to be identified said 
the teheran radio publicity surrounding the final settlement was an 
apparent attempt to lure western oil operations back into iran 
the iranian oil industry badly needs the technological expertise 
and the marketing outlets that western companies have failed to 
provide since their operations were shut down by the revolution 
the oil company claimants were known as the consortium because 
they were allowed back into iran together in 1954 after the 
expropriation of all western oil operations three years earlier by 
leftist iranian prime minister mohammed mossadegh 
mossadegh was overthrown in a 1953 coup 
the two major consortium members british petroleum and royal 
dutch shell which owned 40 percent and 14 percent of the 
consortiums operations respectively negotiated settlements 
directly with iran in 1982 
the other oil companies since have settled with iran under the 
auspices of the iranunited states claims tribunal which has 
arbitrated billions of dollars of financial claims arising from the 
iranian revolution and subsequent expropriations of western 
interests

the european community commission on 
monday proposed extending compensation to the united states for 
reduced us corn exports into spain and portugal 
the proposal to be voted on tuesday is an attempt to avoid a 
trade war and retaliatory measures by the united states if the 
compensation is not extended 
differences in two other farm disputes that divide the united 
states and the 12nation trade bloc remained sizable however 
threatening to further complicate world trade talks officials 
said those difference deal with pork and sparkling wines 
we want to keep a normal relationship going and not slip into 
trade wars that would exacerbate problems said ec farm spokesman 
john cooney explaining the corn proposal 
the united states is expected to agree to the terms the ec has 
proposed officials said 
a oneyear extension would be acceptable said a us 
official who asked not to be named 
when spain and portugal joined the trade bloc in 1986 import 
duties on us feedgrains were raised causing an annual loss of 
some 400 million in us trade 
under a 1987 deal the united states was compensated for the 
losses two million tons of corn and 300000 tons of sorghum can 
now enter the two nations under reduced levies 
the ec commission had wanted to end the compensations but on 
monday offered the oneyear extension if the united states 
withdraws its threat to retaliate with some 400 million of 
additional duties on ec imports 
ec spokesman cooney said some progress was being made in the 
other two farm quarrels but the us official said the issues were 
far from being solved 
one is a ban on us pork imports on the ecs belief that health 
standards in american slaughterhouses are inadequate 
cooney said the us negotiators had offered to upgrade hygiene 
standards in pig slaughterhouses the us official only said 
differences remained sizable 
the ec also wants to overturn a us ban on ec sparkling wines 
with a japanese additive but there too the us official said 
washington could not show an awful lot of flexibility

grain futures prices rose modestly monday on the 
chicago board of trade amid signs the soviet union is in the market 
for us corn 
soybeans closed mostly lower following indications the soviets 
bought south american soybean meal after rumors circulated that 
moscow was pricing us meal 
it was a pretty subdued session said joel karlin an 
analyst with research department inc in chicago 
the united states last week tentatively offered the soviet union 
up to 1 billion in export credits the soviets are expected to 
spend at least some of the credits on grain and other food although 
the agriculture department has not yet revealed details 
talk circulated on the trading floor that the soviets were 
seeking to buy as much as 600000 metric tons of us corn and 
100000 metric tons of soybean meal from us exporters 
a 600000ton corn purchase would fulfill the remainder of the 
soviets commitment under a longterm grain agreement to buy 1 
million metric tons of us corn by the end of this year 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 255 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 3 cents higher with december at 226 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cents higher with december at 110 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cents lower to 3 cents higher with january at 
588 a bushel

trans world airlines inc will get desperately 
needed cash by selling valued london routes to american airlines 
but the retrenchment will make twa a smaller weaker carrier facing 
an uncertain future analysts said monday 
theyre rearranging the chairs on the titanic said julius 
maldutis an airline analyst with salomon brothers inc 
twa chairman carl c icahn said a day earlier he was selling six 
london routes from new york baltimore st louis philadelphia 
los angeles and boston for 445 million to american 
twa also extended an agreement to sell its seventh london route 
from chicago to american for 110 million and will sell gates and 
slots at chicagos ohare international airport to american for 70 
million bringing the total package to 625 million 
analysts viewed the deal as a good move by american to catch up 
with rival united airlines which recently agreed to purchase 
prized london routes from struggling pan american world airways 
for twa the outcome is not so clear 
in the short run the deal gives twa needed cash in the long 
run it could cause problems as one of the nations weaker carriers 
surrenders its traditional strong suit 
for years twa and pan am dominated overseas travel but as 
other airlines got into that market twa and pan am found 
themselves at a disadvantage because they lacked strong domestic 
systems 
the key to the success or failure of twas latest move will 
likely hinge on what icahn does with the cash analysts said 
they probably figured now was the time to get out because 
they couldnt really compete with united once united gets pan ams 
routes said raymond e neidl an airline analyst at dillon read 
amp co inc it does really gut their international operations 
from an operating viewpoint it leaves them in a weak position 
icahn acknowledged he was avoiding a transatlantic battle with 
united but said in a statement the deal will generate additional 
cash liquidity which will enable us to position ourselves for 
growth despite these extremely difficult times 
at the same time twa announced it was selling the london routes 
icahn wrote to pan am chairman thomas g plaskett and offered to 
buy pan ams 150 million outstanding shares for 150 a share in 
cash and 1 a share in either preferred stock or notes 
pan am was studying icahns letter but had no immediate comment 
spokesman jeff kriendler said monday 
analysts had mixed views on the offer from icahn who made a 
similar proposal last month that he said was contingent on a 
collapse of pan ams deal with united had somehow fallen through 
if you put together a system like that it might have some 
strength but it would be a highly leveraged airline neidl said 
its going to be tough for a heavily leveraged airline to survive 
in this environment 
high fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel have combined 
to give the industry record losses this year and analysts say next 
year could be gloomy as well 
but a twapan am marriage might be good for both carriers who 
are among the sagging industrys weaker members said airline 
analyst thomas canning of standard amp poors corp 
being together would be better for them than being separate 
canning said theres a little more mass there and theres a 
lack in the pan am system of domestic routes thats what twa could 
bring to them 
others doubt such a deal can succeed 
if you believe in that you ought to nail your socks to the 
wall because you believe santa claus will visit you tonight 
maldutis said the key to this whole scenario is the financially 
troubled carriers have to sell after a while theres nothing left 
to sell 
neidl said twa might also go shopping for some of the assets of 
eastern airlines some analysts say eastern might not survive after 
its latest cash infusion from a bankruptcy judge in new york runs 
out 
the pilots union at twa meanwhile expressed doubts that any 
good will come of the latest deal by icahn who is known more for 
his takeover forays than for actually managing a business 
we think in the next one to two years he just wants to be the 
broker of these international routes said bill compton the 
chief negotiator for the twa branch of the air line pilots 
association we dont think hes interested in running an 
airline we think hes interested in enriching himself

new york investor william spier said monday 
hes still interested in acquiring desoto inc and would be willing 
to raise his offer for the illinois detergentmaker by 1 a share 
to 525 
spier chairman of sutton holding corp disclosed he wants to 
continue a merger offer he made des plaines illbased desoto 
earlier this month 
desoto has been fending off sutton since last fall through a 
partial liquidation of its various operations it had no comment on 
the sutton announcement 
sutton which holds 8 percent of desoto stock had proposed a 
merger in which it would pay 425 per share in cash and securities 
for each desoto share there are about 4 million desoto shares 
outstanding 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on 
monday spier said he met with desotos financial adviser goldman 
sachs amp co last week at the meeting spiers said he indicated he 
and certain affiliates of sutton were still interested in 
acquiring desoto and would be willing to increase from 425 to 
525 the per share price previously offered 
desoto once a major paint and chemical maker announced an 
agreement in july to sell its domestic consumer paint business to 
sherwinwilliams co of cleveland for 80 million 
previously desoto announced plans to sell its industrial 
coatings and solvents businesses for 200 million 
the sale of those assets and the paint business which had been 
a major supplier to sears roebuck and co reduces desoto to a 
manufacturer of household detergents with plants in illinois 
california and two in georgia

government and business leaders rallied 
around ncr corp on monday in a bid to bolster the computer 
companys effort to fend off atampts hostile takeover attempt 
ncr has served as a valuable corporate citizen whose stake in 
and commitment to dayton has been unmatched said mayor richard 
clay dixon that type of community loyalty deserves community 
loyalty we strongly back ncrs efforts to remain independent 
dixon was joined at a morning news conference by city and county 
commissioners local mayors and area township officials at an 
afternoon news conference local business leaders showed support 
for the daytonbased ncr 
american telephone amp telegraph co has offered to buy ncr for 
61 billion but the ncr board unanimously rejected the 
90pershare tender offer as inadequate 
on sunday atampt announced that it would start a proxy fight in a 
bid to wrest control of ncr from the companys board of directors 
atampt spokesman walter murphy said the company wants ncr 
shareholders to elect a new board that would negotiate with atampt 
and remove ncrs antitakeover provisions 
ncr said in a statement that atampts threat of a proxy contest 
doesnt change ncrs position 
our board has met and after considering atampts offer 
carefully and thoroughly concluded that it is grossly inadequate 
and unfair to our shareholders ncr said we believe our 
shareholders will support us in our efforts to protect their vital 
best interests 
ncrs 5400 employees paid 39 million in payroll taxes to 
dayton in 1989 second only to general motors corp according to 
figures provided by the city in addition the company contributed 
about 6 million to nonprofit organizations half of it going to 
local groups 
ncr has certainly been a good friend to this community and 
supported so many financial and human resources said montgomery 
county commissioner donna moon to lose this partnership would be 
a shame we want to make it clear that its in the best business 
sense and community sense to just say no to this proposed merger 
atampt spokesman burke stinson said atampts offer is fair 
we have i think gone to extraordinary steps to assure people 
that ncr would remain headquartered there their people would be 
virtually unaffected and that no offices or other locations would 
be closed as a result of the merger stinson said 
however i think its only human that many citizens of dayton 
would rally to support a company that has meant so much to 
dayton he said 
in a fullpage ad taken out in the dayton daily news ncr called 
atampt the wrong choice and encouraged residents to voice their 
concerns publicly about the takeover attempt 
wed like to be left alone so that we can continue to develop 
and deliver the leadingedge products and responsive support 
programs you have come to expect from us the ad said 
apparently the folks at atampt cant recognize a busy signal when 
they hear one

of trade amid indications the soviet union is seeking to buy as 
much as 600000 metric tons of us corn 
other grain markets advanced in sympathy with corn but soybean

soybeans were 1 cents lower to 3 cents higher with january at

shopping for us corn and as much as 100000 metric tons of us 
soybean meal after the bush administration last week offered moscow 
a 500 million to 1 billion line of credit analysts said 
the agriculture department is scheduled to provide details of 
the export credit package on tuesday the soviets are expected to 
spend at least some of the export credits on grain and other food 
a 600000ton corn purchase would fulfill the remainder of the 
soviets commitment under a longterm grain agreement to buy 1 
million metric tons of us corn by the end of this year 
soybean prices weakened near the close as talk circulated that 
the soviets bought 50000 to 60000 metric tons of brazilian 
soybean meal and possibly more from argentina 
despite the signs of activity in the recently sluggish export 
market it was a pretty subdued session said joel karlin an 
analyst with research department inc in chicago 
crude oil futures rose modestly on the new york mercantile 
exchange reflecting heightened fears of war in the middle east 
on monday iraq called up older reservists and defiantly 
insisted it would never submit to us demands to quit kuwait 
secretary of state james a baker iii warned nato allies that 
iraq might stage a partial withdrawal from kuwait as a ploy but 
president bush vowed there would be no negotiation for one inch 
of kuwaiti territory

early in the session but profittaking eroded the gains before the 
close

january at 2705 a barrel heating oil was 10 cent to 51 cent 
lower with january at 7473 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
08 cent to 66 cent higher with january at 6633 cents a gallon 
natural gas was 2 cents to 87 cents lower with january at 2175 
per 1000 cubic feet 
gold and silver futures edged higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange in line with the upswing in crude oil 
gold settled 70 cents to 140 higher with december at 37750 a 
troy ounce silver was 19 cents higher across the board with 
december at 3956 a troy ounce 
on the chicago mercantile exchange cattle futures rose modestly 
in lackluster trading buoyed by continued strength in the cash 
cattle market 
hog futures rallied amid perceptions that a winter storm in the 
midwest could slow the pace of marketings pork bellies were 
pressured by technical sell signals analysts said 
live cattle settled unchanged to 15 cent higher with december 
at 8110 cents a pound feeder cattle were 13 cent to 52 cent 
higher with january at 8930 cents a pound live hogs were

damage confidence in the british colony reverting to chinese rule 
in 1997 
hongkong and shanghai banking corp chairman william purves said 
the decision reflected the banks global reach and did not signal 
abandonment of the territory where it has flourished for 125 years 
we shall remain headquartered in the territory which is an 
important and profitable market for us purves said 
nonetheless stock brokers and others with a feel for hong 
kongs financial pulse said the move would be interpreted as 
another sign of eroding confidence in the future of the teeming 
capitalist enclave on chinas southern tip 
under a historic agreement between china and britain the 
chinese have promised to preserve hong kongs way of life for at 
least 50 years after the british lease expires in 1997 
but faith in chinas pledge has been shaken in the past year by 
the crackdown on a prodemocracy movement in beijing and bickering 
between china and britain over the exact terms of the takeover 
agreement 
many hong kong residents who have the financial means have 
sought visas to emigrate and a number of important businesses have 
restructure to protect their assets offshore in case the 
sinobritish accord falters 
one broker speaking on condition of anonymity said the hongkong 
and shanghai bank announcement which transfers the banks assets 
to a british holding company leaves the impression that the 
british are pulling out 
chinese authorities had no immediate comment on the move by the 
bank brokers noted that the decision will create the unique 
situation of a major financial institution which operates in some 
ways like a central bank being owned by a company based abroad 
the bank for example issues more than half of the currency and 
functions as the main check clearing bank in hong kong its hidden 
secret reserves are believed to be worth more than 2 billion 
under the plan the bank will rename its silom ltd subsdiary as 
hsbc holdings ltd hsbc holdings will then be transformed into an 
umbrella company owning hongkong and shanghai bank and all its 
holdings 
silom which managed the banks land holdings in thailand is 
based in hong kong but registered in britain 
in addition the banks subsidiary operations in north america 
the middle east and europe which account for about 30 percent of 
its assets will be stripped from the bank and taken over by the 
holding company directly 
those subsidiaries include the new yorkbased marine midland 
bank hongkong and shanghai bank of canada and the british bank of 
the middle east 
the banks subsidiaries in asia will remain directly controlled 
by hongkong and shanghai bank 
shareholders will receive one share of stock in the holding 
company for every four shares in bank stock 
purves said the banks decision taken at a recent board 
meeting would have to receive formal approval during a 
shareholders meeting scheduled in february 
the chairman said the decision to reorganize the bank was made 
following numerous questions from investors and regulators 
overseas 
hongkong bank believes that concerns on their part although 
perhaps understandable in the light of the unprecedented future 
constitutional status of hong kong are misplaced he said 
however the concerns of the people outside hong kong who deal 
with the group cannot be ignored 
he also said the decision would allow the bank more flexibility 
in making international deals 
hongkong banks decision parallels moves by other major 
companies in the colony to both restructure and transfer assets 
abroad as the chinese takeover approaches 
the trading house jardine matheson holdings has moved its 
domicile to bermuda hutchison whampao ltd which runs the port 
has purchased the controlling share of an oil company in canada and 
large amounts of property in vancouver 
purves also announced that hongkong and shanghai bank was 
abandoning plans to merge with britains midland bank attributing 
that decision to difficult economic conditions affecting major 
banks worldwide 
hongkong bank bought a 149 percent stake in midland at the end 
of 1987 the two had an agreement which expires friday that barred 
increasing their shareholdings in each other

chrysler corp said monday it would 
start equipping its minivans with optional driverside air bags in 
february becoming the first us automaker to offer the safety 
devices on the popular vehicles 
for customers who dont want them chrysler will refund 500 
from feb 1 to march 31 chrysler will offer minivans with 
driverside air bags chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski said it 
hasnt been announced what will be done after that 
chrysler could make the devices standard equipment keep them as 
options or discontinue their availability 
meanwhile the company began a new incentive program monday with 
a 500 cash rebate offer for buyers of 1991 model dodge caravan and 
plymouth voyager series minivans through the end of january 
chrysler put the first incentives on its popular minivans a year 
ago for about the same length of time sales of the light trucks 
shot up during the sixweek period then dropped 
through dec 10 of this year chryslers minivan sales have 
dropped 4 percent from last year to 346944 chrysler holds 43 
percent of the minivan market 
chrysler made driverside air bags standard equipment starting 
with its 1990 cars general motors corp makes them standard on 
about 15 car lines while ford motor co puts driverside air bags 
on its major lines or about 1 million cars 
the federal government which requires automatic seat belts or 
air bags in cars being made today will require passive restraint 
systems in light trucks by the 1995 model year minivans fall under 
that category 
for now chrysler appears to be the only domestic automaker to 
move toward air bags in its minivans ford has not announced any 
plans for air bags in its aerostar minivan said ford spokesman 
mike parris while john dinan of gm said only that the huge 
automaker would conform to the 1995 passive restraint requirements 
gm offers minivans through four of its divisions 
also on monday jeep boosted incentives for its 1991 jeep 
cherokees to 1000 previously the vehicles had carried 
incentives of either 500 or 750 depending on model

mesa limited partnership and its chief investor t 
boone pickens will look for other deals to help reduce 1 billion 
in debt a spokesman said monday after a 350 million sale of 
natural gas properties couldnt be completed 
mesa had planned to use the proceeds from selling 13 percent of 
its proven natural gas reserves to help whittle down the shortterm 
bank debt but the buyer seagull energy corp of houston couldnt 
secure financing to complete the deal 
we plan to take a long hard look at the options available in 
the coming weeks said mesa spokesman jay rosser those options 
include the sale of other properties he said 
mesa whose cash flow has been reduced by low natural gas 
prices has been looking for ways to repay the 1 billion in 
shortterm debt 
it said last week a broker was looking for buyers to privately 
place a reported 600 million of the debt resulting in debt that 
could be repaid over a longer period of up to 20 years 
that deal and the seagull purchase would have allowed mesa to 
repay 95 percent of the debt 
despite losing the seagull deal mesa will be able to meet make 
a 100 million debt payment due at the end of the month rosser 
said 
mesa and seagull first announced the deal in october and 
finalized it two weeks ago the companies however said its 
completion hinged on seagull obtaining financial commitments by 
last friday 
were not able to get financing on terms we considered 
acceptable said alan payne a spokesman for seagull he declined 
to discuss specific terms 
seagull had planned to help finance the transaction by selling 
three million shares of common stock that sale will not occur now 
the company said 
seagull will continue exploring other gas property purchases 
payne said we are interested in acquiring oil and gas 
properties particularly gas we were before this and will be after 
this he said

major foreign currencies monday buoyed by heightened concern over 
the potential for war in the persian gulf 
gold rose slightly 
currency trading was sparse as participants wrapped up their 
endoftheyear positions in anticipation of the christmas holiday 
but traders said fresh war talk by president bush supported the 
dollar generally considered a safehave investment in times of 
turmoil 
since iraqi troops invaded kuwait on aug 2 traders have 
focused on heightened war tensions there often to the exclusion of 
economic factors that ordinarily might sway the markets direction

saddam hussein completely withdraw his forces from kuwait by jan 
15 the deadline imposed by the united nations 
there will be no concession no negotiation for one inch of 
territory bush said he has got to leave without condition

minister tariq aziz on the crisis if mutually acceptable dates can 
be arranged for that meeting and a reciprocal meeting between 
secretary of state james a baker iii and hussein in baghdad 
the dollar is definitely being propped up by the impression 
that maybe the situation in the persian gulf is deteriorating 
slightly said robert hatcher a corporate dealer at barclays 
bank plc 
in early trading on foreign markets dealers said the market 
fretted over news that the british foreign office has advised 
dependents of british workers in bahrain qatar and the eastern 
province of saudi arabia to leave before jan 15 
but expectations of lower us interest rates were undermining 
the dollar and trading was unusually light in the week before the 
christmas holiday traders said 
the dollar strengthened slightly against the british pound with 
sterling closing at 19305 in new york down from late fridays

donald trump announced monday that he 
made nearly 35 million in interest payments he owed bondholders in 
two of his three casinos 
also monday casino control commission chairman steve perskie 
denied a request by trumps newest casino the taj mahal to seal 
documents detailing the gambling halls restructuring of 675 
million in bonds 
the deadline passed saturday for trump to make a 161 million 
bond payment on the trump plaza hotel and casino and an 184 
million payment on the trump castle grace periods for the two 
properties did not begin until monday 
trump said in a telephone interview monday afternoon from new 
york that the trump organization infused a relatively small 
amount of money to make the trump castle payment he would not 
specify how much the new yorkbased organization transferred to 
trump castle 
the trump organizations chief financial officer stephen 
bollenbach said the amount was well under 1 million 
the trump plaza payment was made entirely from that casinos 
funds trump said bollenbach said both casinos have enough money 
handy although published reports last week indicated the casino 
would have zero operating funds if it supplied all the money for 
the payment 
we made the payment on time in fact ahead of time if you 
look at the grace periods trump said 
he said he believed the casinos have turned the corner from a 
slump that began when the mammoth taj mahal opened april 2 taking 
away business from all the casinos in the city 
trump said he believes atlantic city can turn around before 
trump castle faces its next payment in june and added that he has 
no plans to sell the casino one of two gaming properties not 
located on the citys boardwalk 
im very proud of the property he said we just finished 
a large construction and that has hurt he said 
analysts said earlier monday before trump made his announcement 
that they would be surprised if trump made the payment on the trump 
castle which does not generate as much revenue as the plaza 
trump castle failed last june 15 to make a 43 million bond 
payment setting into motion an emergency bank loan that pledged 
trumps three casinos as collateral for the new loans 
the casino commission is now studying the financial stability of 
the taj mahal which renegotiated its 675 million in debt one day 
after failing to make a 473 million payment due nov 15 
the documents released monday detail a plan that would give 
bondholders half ownership in the taj mahal in exchange for an 
interest rate reduction from 14 percent to 12 percent and 
spreading of the repayment date to october 1999 instead of 1998 
the casino intends to file a prepackaged bankruptcy under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and leave bankruptcy court 
by the spring 
the commission has said it intends to rule on the financial 
stability of the taj mahal at a still undetermined date in january 
the gaming regulators will likely look at the financial stability 
of the other two properties after that 
the commission can take away the license of a casino operator if 
it finds the licensee is financially unstable

drexel burnham lambert inc accused federal 
thrift regulators monday of inventing and exaggerating some of its 
68 billion in damages claims against the collapsed wall street 
firm 
in papers filed in manhattan federal court drexel also accused 
the federal deposit insurance corp and resolution trust corp of 
seeking to blame the former junkbond pioneer for the savings and 
loan industry collapse 
the agencies claimed last month that drexel had contributed to 
the failure of more than 40 savings and loans by fraudulent sales 
of risky highyield bonds 
the claims were to be negotiated along with more than 100 other 
civil filings in drexels chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization but 
the thrift agencies now are requesting separate trials to determine 
how much they deserve 
drexel said the fdicrtc has something other than just money 
at stake here it seeks scapegoats like drexel for the deplorable 
state of the savings and loan industry which these regulators 
themselves and others have caused 
drexel said the fdic and rtcs action was threatening to derail 
the firms bankruptcy reorganization and jeopardizing negotiations 
with other creditors 
the fdicrtc has so inflated its claims and manufactured so 
many claims as to have chilled meaningful discussions with most 
holders of contingent claims the court papers said 
the dispute is important because of the nature of the filings 
more than 30 billion in claims were filed against drexel related 
to securities law violations the firm admitted last year but none 
of the claimants are expected to get the full amount 
the parties were to negotiate the size of all claims and allot 
an amount to be paid by drexel in a reorganization but drexel 
claims the regulators have stymied talks 
drexel asked us district judge milton pollack who is 
overseeing the civil claims to order the thrift regulators to hold 
a hearing by april 1 to set a limit on the size of the thrift 
claims 
the fdic and rtc said in court papers recently that it opposed 
drexels proposals for estimating the size of the damages and 
sought a freeze on all bankruptcy proceedings pending trials on 
their claims 
the fdic insures deposits for the nations savings and loans 
resolution trust oversees the federal thrift bailout and has taken 
over more than 100 failed sampls 
the agencies claims reflect total junk bond losses at the 
thrifts to date of 2 billion the alleged damages are tripled 
under federal antitrust and racketeering laws for a total of 6 
billion 
other claims reflect 800 million in losses from alleged illegal 
trading unrelated to junk bonds involving 15 failed thrifts 
they are by far the largest damages sought in the sampl crisis 
which is expected to cost taxpayers more than 500 billion over 30 
years
