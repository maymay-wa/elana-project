the head of new caledonias separatist movement and 
the islands conservative profrench deputy reached agreement early 
sunday on the future of the troubled territory prime minister 
michel rocard announced 
he said that under the accord paris will assume direct control 
of the south pacific territory for the next 12 months with new 
caledonians voting in referendum in 10 years on the issue of 
selfdetermination 
rocard also said he would propose to president francois 
mitterrand that the french people be consulted in a referendum on 
new institutions to be set up to develop the territory 
tensions in new caledonia an island group 1000 miles east of 
australia have remained high 21 people were killed in may when a 
french army assault team stormed a cave to free 23 hostages held by 
native melanesian separatists 
thirty people have died in violence in new caledonia since april 
22 
the accord reached sunday came after negotations in paris 
involving rocard jeanmarie tjibaou head of the kanak socialist 
national liberation front and deputy jacques lafleur 
the kanaks or melanesians represent about 43 percent of the 
new caledonias 145000 residents and most favor independence the 
rest of the population comprises descendents of european settlers 
asians and polynesians most of whom prefer to remain french 
france colonized the islands in 1853 
rocard brought tjibaou and lafleur together last week for their 
first meeting since 1982 he said they both would take the 
agreement to their respective constituencies and call for approval 
tjibaou called the agreement reached sunday an important 
step but said the new caledonia problem has not been solved and 
native melanesians will continue to demand independence 
he said the talks were difficult because the demands of the two 
sides were contradictory and because of the tense atmosphere in the 
territory 
each side now is committed to halt bloodshed and end mourning 
for many families tjibaou said 
a statement issued by rocard called on the territorys 
inhabitants to be hopeful for a new page has been turned not by 
arms but by dialogue and tolerance by hard work and good will 
rocard made a solution to the new caledonia problem a priority 
after mitterrand named him prime minister 45 days ago the 
agreement seems likely to restore some of rocards prestige which 
was tarnished after the socialists failed to win a majority in 
legislative elections that followed the may 8 presidential vote

a new airbus jetliner carrying more than 
130 people crashed into a forest sunday during an air show 
demonstration flight killing at least three people and injuring 
98 officials said 
many victims were believed to be firsttime fliers who paid for 
a ride on the twinengine airbus a320 which was delivered to air 
france only thursday 
witnesses said the plane which touts a stateoftheart 
electronic flight system had just passed over the airfield hosting 
the show when it crashed tearing a nearly 500foot path through 
the woods 
part of the plane caught fire 
a control tower official said the jet appeared to lose power as 
it passed over the field in habsheim a village about 15 miles from 
the swiss border 
mondays editions of the paris daily newspaper lhumanite quoted 
the jets pilot as telling a rescue worker i wanted to to 
increase the power but the aircraft did not respond 
it was about 20 meters 65 feet above the ground with its 
flaps and landing gear down when it clipped some trees at the end 
of the runway and crashed in the forest bernard labalette an 
amateur pilot was quoted by agence francepresse as saying 
visibility was perfect 
a 25yearold woman passenger who did not give her name was 
quoted by afp as saying she heard trees brush against the fuselage 
from then on things went fast she said the plane hit the 
ground hard and we had the feeling of an abrupt jolt then there 
was a fire in the front of the aircraft 
flight attendants deployed evacuation chutes and the woman said 
she and other passengers slid down and ran away fearing an 
explosion 
rescuers worked throughout the afternoon to evacuate dozens of 
people trapped in the battered plane the impact broke the planes 
wings and smashed the cockpit windows the fuselage was blackened 
from smoke afp said 
local officials said 50 people were hospitalized it was not 
clear how many were on the jet as there was no official passenger 
list authorities said at least 136 were aboard 
officials said the pilot michel asseline and the copilot 
pierre mazieres were not injured 
initial reports said four people were killed the local 
officials not named in accordance with french practice later said 
they were able to confirm three deaths they said some victims were 
badly burned 
there was an explosion and a cloud of smoke but from the 
control tower we couldnt see said the tower official who did 
not give his name 
he said about 1000 people were at the show and that many on the 
plane were making their first flight at such air shows spectators 
are invited to participate in an air baptism or take their 
first flight for a small fee 
the plane made six flights on saturday 
the a320 built in toulouse france by a european consortium 
went into service in april for air france and british airways it 
was conceived and certified for flight by a twomember crew 
eliminating the navigator 
early this year pilots and flight engineers of air inter the 
largest french airline called a series of strikes to protest the 
use of only two cockpit members in a320s saying it was unsafe 
in london british airways suspended service on its two a320 
aircraft as a precautionary measure pending information on the 
cause of the accident in habsheim which is just outside mulhouse 
and 250 miles east of paris 
air france president jacques friedman said that as a precaution 
the airline was replacing an a320 due to fly to dusseldorf and 
berlin on sunday night with a boeing 737 and cancelling a 
pariszurich flight 
french transport minister louis mermez said a commission of 
inquiry would begin work monday 
the airbus a320 can carry 168 passengers airbus indusrie its 
manufacturer has orders to purchase 500 of the craft 
minneapolisbased northwest airlines agreed to buy some of the 
a320s for delivery in 1990 and 1991 
i doubt the crash would have an impact on our decision to 
purchase from airbus alan muncaster staff vice president of 
corporate communications for northwest said sunday but 
obviously we would want to check into the cause of the crash 
air france has three of the aircraft british airways has two 
and air inter the french domestic airline has one airbus said 
we are disturbed shocked and saddened said airbus press 
spokesman robert alizart in toulouse he said it was the first 
crash of an a320 
alizart said it was too early to say whether the future of the 
aircraft which received its certification feb 26 could be in 
doubt 
the plane has a range of about 3700 miles and consumes 40 
percent less fuel than similar two or three engine jets 
it is the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully 
computerized flightcontrol system the manufacturer says permits 
safer electronically controlled flight instead of the old control 
column in front of the pilot there is a pistolgrip side stick 
linked to five computers that modify and relay the pilots 
directions to wing and tail flaps

worldwide grain stocks could sink to their lowest 
levels of the decade and lead to possible food shortages if the 
crippling us drought continues for another two weeks according 
to a un organization 
but officials at the un food and agriculture organization say 
favorable weather and crop prospects have created a brighter farm 
picture in most of the rest of the world 
before the us drought took hold the romebased un 
organization already was projecting that world grain production in 
198889 would not match consumption and that stocks would drop 
close to the level the agency considers the minimum necessary to 
safeguard world food security 
now with the us drought the question is how much is us 
production going to be drawn down peter newhouse chief of the 
agencys global information and early warning service said in an 
interview friday 
its still too early for firm projections it all depends on 
the rain in the next two weeks he said 
the organization had projected june that the united states would 
produce 279 million tons of this years targeted 167 billion tons 
of grain worldwide but that was before the worst drought since the 
great depression parched the midwest 
if the present dry weather were to continue over the next 
couple of weeks then there would be a severe shortfall in us 
crops particularly maize corn newhouse said we had already 
projected that with normal weather conditions the stocks could 
fall close to the minimum level now if the drought continues 
theres a distinct possibility it could fall below that 
the un organization considers the minimum level to be 17 
percent to 18 percent of the projected global consumption of wheat 
for the following year the last time the level fell to the minimum 
level was in 1981 
stocks have not dropped below the minimum since the mid1970s 
they hit a low of 14 percent during the global food crisis of 
197273 
if stocks go below the mininum level it would mean the world 
is more vulnerable than it should be and could face food supply 
difficulties newhouse said 
weve still got a cushion but if the cushion is going to 
be used up it looks like the food situation on a global level is 
going to be a lot tighter 
newhouse said the organization will have to be very vigilant 
in monitoring us cereal crops and those in asia the soviet union 
and africa 
fortunately harvest prospects outside the united states and 
canada are generally favorable newhouse said 
at this moment we dont see any widespread drought problems 
nothing dramatic said rene gommes of the agencys 
agrometeorological department 
the only country that produces more cereal crops than the united 
states is china with about 350 million tons annually third is the 
soviet union with 200 million tons 
newhouse said harvest prospects were good in the soviet union 
in china drought has hit some areas and floods have hit others 
but at this point were not worried about china he said 
an important factor for world crop production is the monsoon 
season in india bangladesh and pakistan which were hit by severe 
drought last year 
the monsoon started in may on time this year but its still 
far too early to say what will happen newhouse said 
one of the worlds most serious food supply situations is 
occurring partly as a result of heavy rainfall in areas often prone 
to drought conditions swarms of migrating desert locusts who 
breed in rainy conditions have invaded the sahel region of 
subsaharan africa 
the infestation is of unprecedented dimensions and will affect 
the food security of 15 african countries from the atlantic ocean 
to the red sea the un groups directorgeneral edouard 
saouma said friday 
in african countries such as angola mozambique sudan and 
ethiopia civil war has aggravated crop failures in ethiopia 
where drought and famine killed up to 1 million people in 198485 
more than 7 million people are reported threatened by the drought 
and last years crop failures 
the crop planting season is now under way in ethiopia so it 
wont be known until the end of the year whether the country can 
recover newhouse said 
in latin america northeast brazil suffered severe drought last 
year but the weather has improved and newhouse believes the harvest 
will recover mexico however is expecting a shortfall of more 
than 1 million tons in its wheat harvest he said

sophisticated drug ring that smuggled cocaine from colombia to the 
united states authorities said 
authorities also said they arrested four others who participated 
in the operation 
the arrests were announced late friday by the federal attorney 
generals office 
authorities said rancher agustin liceaga ruibal 48 and 
businessman rene liceaga ruibal 46 were part of a smuggling ring 
that operated clandestine air strips safe houses and 
moneylaundering businesses in several mexican states 
an emotional gov victor manuel liceaga ruibal called the case a 
family tragedy during a hastily called news conference in la 
paz the state capital late friday he said he knew nothing of his 
brothers activities 
i am completely clean he declared 
the governor said state authorities cooperated fully with the 
federal investigation and would continue to do so 
authorities said his brothers allowed at least one of their 
ranches to be used for clandestine air strips where drugladen 
planes en route from colombia to the united states refueled 
investigators said they have tracked at least 10 flights 
in addition to the governors brothers four other people were 
arrested jose pineda trinidad antonio alcantara varela ramon

a judge awarded 75 million to a 
man who was seriously hurt in a collision with a drunken driver 
after ruling that padre island national seashore rangers were 
negligent in failing to arrest the driver earlier 
us district judge spencer williams granted the award friday to 
randy william crider 33 of corpus christi a motorcyclist who 
lost an arm and a leg in the 1983 collision with a car driven by 
john lee landry 23 
the interior department which oversees federal parks and the 
us attorneys office will decide whether to appeal the decision 
within 60 days said assistant us attorney wayne campbell 
we think that the 75 million is fair but no amount of money 
can compensate for what randy crider has suffered said his 
attorney ben sley this however will give him the chance at a 
meaningful life 
crider said park rangers larry couser and james f copeland had 
stopped landry 10 hours before the accident for driving 40 mph in a 
15mph zone on a public road on padre island the rangers ticketed 
landry and allowed him to continue 
williams who was brought from san jose calif to corpus 
christi to hear the case ruled march 17 that not arresting landry 
was an act of negligence and that as a consequence an accident 
occurred 
evidence at the trial showed that landry had consumed 7 or 8 
ounces of liquor and had smoked several marijuana cigarettes in the 
three or four hours before he was stopped for speeding sley had 
argued that the marijuana could have impaired landrys actions for 
12 to 24 hours and that the alcohol intensified the effects of the 
marijuana 
landry who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in the 
accident was sentenced to eight years in prison 
sley who had sought 75 million said the case could lead 
authorities around the nation to tighten enforcement of 
drunkendriving laws 
i think the award sends a message throughout the nation that 
authorities have to enforce the drunkdriving laws or face serious 
liability exposure he said 
however padre island rangers have not changed enforcement of 
drunkendriving laws since the march ruling said park 
superintendent john d hunter the parks superintendent 
we might seek a little more advice from the us attorney but 
our rangers are operating pretty much status quo hunter said 
adding that the judgment places an unfair burden on his rangers

authorities suspect that an israeli reserve 
soldier who claimed he was stabbed by four arabs while hitchhiking 
lied because he was late returning to his base a police 
spokeswoman said sunday 
on saturday a bomb exploded near an israeli bus as it headed to 
a jewish settlement 37 miles north of jerusalem in the occupied 
west bank it damaged the vehicle but caused no injuries 
the 38yearold soldier chaim yosef said the arabs assaulted 
him and tried to grab his weapon saturday as he hitchhiked at the 
mesubim junction near the coastal city of tel aviv an army 
spokesman had said 
the israeli itim news agency said yosef told police he was 
stabbed four times

whether it is correct

may have made up the story to avoid punishment for failing to 
report on time for military duty

the reported assault but they were later freed mrs hertzberg 
said 
earlier saturday troops shot and wounded a palestinian in the 
west bank town of nablus

others are managing to exorcise the trouble 
several clerks have been fielding complaints from motorists who 
are unhappy that the number on their new threeletter three digit 
tags is 666 which some believe is the mark of the devil 
most of them wont take it when they get it said davidson 
county clerk bill covington you might draw the wrong kind of 
crowd 
covington said his office has withdrawn the 666 plates from 
davidson countys stockpile all 366 of them 
the thought never entered out minds said danny shelton 
manager of tennessees license plate program of the 666 
combination which occurs every thousand plates registrants do 
not have to accept the plates when theyre issued 
not all motorists have felt compelled to reject the number 
even one whos a man of the cloth 
a lot of people mentioned it to me especially since im a 
minister said john miller of nashville pastor of the tusculum 
church of christ who accepted a plate with 666 the beast is 
very very evil but it has nothing to do with what number is on 
your license plate or your social security card

four steel bins filled with unsold grain 
are mel rodenburgs hedge against a drought that wiped out his 
1300 acres of wheat oats and rye this spring 
as the drought drags on and grain prices soar hes one of 
thousands of farmers who stand to make a tidy profit from selling 
their share of the billions of bushels of wheat and corn stockpiled 
around the nation 
the drought makes it tough going but yes we are going to 
get along quite comfortably said rodenburg 
rodenburg 57 has 14000 bushels of wheat stored in the bins on 
his 3000acre farm the wheat is worth 385 a bushel up 115 
from a few weeks ago the price likely will rise much more perhaps 
as high as 7 a bushel some have speculated 
while some farmers worry whether they will have anything to sell 
at all this year rodenburg and his 26yearold son alan worry 
whether they will sell too soon 
if you sold it this week and it made another 1 jump next 
week it would make you feel sick alan rodenburg said if you 
screw up a decision this year you are screwing up it just about 
gives you an ulcer trying to figure out what to do 
the rodenburgs represent a segment of the nations farmers 
likely to withstand the worst drought since the dust bowl days of 
the 1930s 
according to the us agriculture department farmers hold at 
least half of the 12 billion bushels of wheat and 56 billion 
bushels of corn in storage 
in north dakota the nations secondlargest wheat producer 
after kansas 300 million bushels of wheat are held in storage an 
amount equal to the states average annual yield according to the 
state wheat commission 
people who do hold these stocks and do sell them are going to 
make a nice profit on it said brad karem the agriculture 
departments farm program analyst 
i think thats private enterprise said milton hertz head 
of the us agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
its terrible that a drought has to create something like that 
some of north dakotas farmers have as much as 60000 bushels of 
grain mostly wheat stored on their farms and under government 
loan estimated alan falk an ascs price support specialist in 
fargo 
farmers stand to make a profit on the stockpiled grain even if 
they have to pay off their government loans to get it out of 
storage said neal fisher deputy administrator of the state wheat 
commission at last years loan rate they could make 150 to 2 a 
bushel he said 
rodenburg is hesitant to talk about his good fortune at a time 
the drought could drive some of his neighbors out of business 
the most he will say is that his farm income could be half of 
normal but i dont know lets leave it like that 
a combination of insurance government help good planning and 
plain good luck will offset his losses 
insurance covers the seed and fertilizer on the crops that were 
destroyed 
his land payments are minimal since he owns 2000 acres of his 
farm free and clear what debt he does have is covered by 
3750anacre government payments on 900 acres of highly erodible 
land he took out of production 
an emergency measure by the agriculture department let him cut 
the healthy crop of alfalfa on that land for hay 
hell lose some of his government payment on the land he hays 
but the first field he cut produced about 1 tons per acre and he 
thinks hay may eventually sell for as much as 100 a ton the 
potential income is going to be unreal more than enough to pay 
for the baler he recently bought at a farm auction he said 
the government also may make up for the income rodenburg lost 
when his crop was destroyed farmbelt members of congress want the 
reagan administration to pay farmers the price guaranteed them when 
grain prices were low that subsidy could mean at least 10000 to 
15000 more for rodenburg 
years of hard work and reasonably good management allowed 
rodenburg to pay off loans on the 2000 acres of land he owns 
debtfree but his fortunes could take a drastic turn if the 
drought lasts another season he said 
next year if we are standing here like this and under the 
same circumstances i will be painting a far gloomier picture for 
us he said standing in the baking afternoon sun alongside his 
grain bins 
i think i would be better off getting a good crop the 
farmer said i dont believe you could ever have a drought where 
it indirectly really benefits you

sunspot activity is increasing rapidly and 
during the next few years could lead to the most intense solar 
disturbances ever recorded the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said sunday 
intense disturbances on the sun can have serious effects on 
earth including interference with broadcasting damage to 
sensitive electronic systems in satellites and disturbances in 
electrical power and telephone transmissions 
some scientists also have speculated that activity on the sun 
could affect the climate on earth an idea that has prompted 
considerable controversy in the meteorological community 
changes in rainfall patterns have occurred roughly in parallel 
with changes on the sun over the years however proving that the 
two are connected has so far eluded science 
sunspots occur in cycles of approximately 11 years 
climatologists have found slight variations in rainfall patterns in 
the united states over periods of 11 years in the central and 
western states and over 22 years in the eastern states 
the current cycle began in september 1986 and already has seen 
record rates of increase in sunspots and radiation from the sun 
according to gary heckman head of the noaaair force space 
environment services center in boulder colo 
the most active previous solar cycle occurred in 1958 activity 
on the sun is already at about the same rate as in that year but 
with somewhat more intensity 
heckman noted that in a typical cycle sunspots increase to their 
maximum in about 43 years and then take some 66 years to decline 
to a minimum again but cycles with rapid increases as in the 
current case have higher and earlier maximum levels 
sunspots themselves do not affect the earth but are used as 
indicators of other solar activity which does such as solar flares 
and geomagnetic storms bombarding the earth with radiation 
among the potential problems associated with an increase in 
solar activity according to heckman are 
increasing activity by the aurora borealis or northern lights 
also the aurora australis or southern lights in antarctica 
interference with some kinds of radio communications and 
broadcasts 
disturbances in electrical power transmission systems 
pipelines and longline telephone networks 
damage to satellites electronic systems 
altered orbits of some satellites 
radiation hazards to astronauts and aircraft passengers at high 
altitudes

pope john paul ii has used his austrian 
tour to reach out to those nearby roman catholics whose eastern 
bloc countries he has not been able to visit 
while most attention on the fiveday trip has focused on the 
popes remarks about jews and the holocaust john paul has also 
been looking to millions of catholics in yugoslavia hungary and 
czechoslovakia 
on saturday about 20000 yugoslav catholics crossed the border 
to the nearby austrian town of gurk for an outdoor mass the day 
before the pope said mass for 80000 catholics mostly yugoslavs 
and hungarians in the town of trausdorf near the hungarian border 
the pope has visited poland his communist homeland three times 
since he became head of the roman catholic church in 1978 but so 
far communist governments have imposed barriers that have kept him 
from visiting millions of catholics in czechoslovakia hungary 
east germany yugoslavia and the soviet union 
czechoslovak catholics in particular have been in conflict with 
communist authorities who until this year had not permitted any 
new bishops in their country since 1973 earlier this month prague 
authorities finally allowed three new ones 
the estimated 20000 yugoslav catholics joined about 40000 
italians and austrians for the outdoor mass on saturday in gurk 
you all give testimony of the power of christian faith to 
overcome boundaries john paul said coming from several 
cultures you as the people of god speak the one language of common 
belief 
unfortunately today in europe even in your regions the 
ancient roots of faith are threatened in various ways the 
pontiff said changing briefly from german to italian in his homily 
he continued christians must however react as a community 
to this challenge they must unite even more and stay even closer 
together 
on friday he said his mass for the 80000 catholics mostly 
yugoslavs and hungarians in trausdorf several hundred poles and 
several dozen czechs also were on hand 
addressing the local austrian catholics the pontiff said 
this diocese and its bishop are well aware of their function as a 
link in particular with the peoples of eastern europe 
you are ready to cultivate contacts with them and to share 
with them materially and spiritually he said must not the 
salvation christ has given us again be spread to the farthest 
bounds of europe 
some austrian newspapers hailed the mass as a major gesture 
toward eastern europe 
trausdorf a signal for the east bloc trumpeted viennas 
kleine zeitung daily newspaper in its saturday editions 
other newspapers though felt that the pontiff had kept his 
remarks deliberately lowkey possibly in hope of not upsetting any 
chances he may have of visiting any new eastern european countries 
he overcame barriers by not putting up any said the 
conservative die presse daily newspaper of vienna

george bush calls it his truth squad an 
army of republican standins with orders to take shots at opponent 
michael dukakis the democrats camp has a less charitable label 
hit squad 
no matter the name the bush surrogates made up of senators 
and house members governors and other prominent republicans are 
already having an impact on the 1988 presidential race 
the surrogates are fanning out across the country and 
criticizing the allbutcertain democratic nominee sometimes 
speaking in the same cities hours before or after dukakis a 
technique the bush campaign calls bracketing 
for a national campaign strapped for cash the tactic is 
inexpensive and enables the vice president to get mileage from the 
sharp attacks without having to utter the words himself 
the republican strategy became apparent during a dukakis swing 
through the south last week when sen john mccain rariz spoke 
in nashville and miami a day ahead of dukakis branding the 
massachusetts governor soft on crime and an opponent of the death 
penalty 
dukakis called it negative campaigning and derided mccain as 
someone who doesnt know beans from brown bread but the gop 
footwork was not lost on dukakis strategists 
a few days later bush delivered a strong lawandorder speech 
to the national association of sheriffs in louisville ky after 
the room cleared one sheriff lingered near the press area wearing 
a large dukakis sticker he was hard to miss 
sheriff robert c rufo of suffolk county mass which includes 
the city of boston suggested the vice president not dukakis 
lacked a crimefighters record 
at all these conventions there are going to be very strong 
dukakis supporters theyre not going to be shy said leslie 
dach communications director for the dukakis campaign 
but dach said that while dukakis will have some surrogate 
speakers he will not field anywhere near the number that bush is 
using 
ultimately this kind of tactic is not going to work george 
bushs problem is he hasnt articulated his own vision of the 
future and thats what people want in a president theyre not 
looking for somebody who can organize a hit squad dach said 
although surrogates have been used before including elected gop 
officials who spoke out vociferously in 1984 in behalf of president 
reagans reelection effort the bush campaign is seeking to turn 
the practice into a science carefully targeting speakers to 
subjects and audiences 
we have about 10 out there now by the fall well have 100 
said alixe glen a bush spokeswoman 
bush who says the surrogate speakers will play a vital part in 
his campaign told reporters last week that he thinks the 
differences between him and dukakis remain out of focus and 
thats where the surrogate speakers will help 
ive got to spell it out the differences and get surrogates 
those other people who believe as i do to spell it out bush 
said 
some of the surrogates have specific assignments 
for instance new hampshire gov john sununus marching orders 
are to chip away at dukakis socalled massachusetts miracle 
which the neighboring governor derides as the massachusetts 
mirage 
on friday for example sununu told reporters no one should be 
surprised at dukakis signing a 40 million cigarette tax into law 
because everytime hes had a problem hes run to a tax increase 
even when he ran the first time and gave an ironclad commitment 
there would be no tax increase 
former massachusetts gov ed king is also speaking on behalf of 
bush with the same message and illinois gov james thompson and 
new jersey gov thomas kean have also been active as surrogates 
to counter his high negatives among women voters bush is 
counting on a number of prominent gop women including rep lynn 
martin of illinois and sen nancy kassebaum of kansas to get out 
the word that he is concerned with issues that affect women 
vanquished gop presidential rivals rep jack kemp of new york 
and sen bob dole of kansas are also busy on the surrogate circuit 
dole the senate minority leader has already been to nine state 
conventions and we will be to 20 said dole aide walt riker 
hes just crashing his way downfield 
the bush campaign and the republican national committee are 
sharing the expenses of the surrogate program 
but one republican skeptical of the ultimate value of the 
technique is mccain the arizona senator who dogged dukakis in the 
south 
the dukakis people were clearly stunned by this said 
mccain noting that democrats retaliated by attacking him at home 
for missing senate votes while campaigning for bush 
i was gone 24 hours i missed five votes all of which were 
either nonessential or carried by margins such as 92to3 
mccain said that surrogate speakers have been used extensively 
in the past by both parties and that he believes the concept is 
helpful but only minimally to candidates 
thats why i was intrigued at the way dukakis and his people 
overreacted mccain said i think its ridiculous that he 
responds by saying i dont know the difference between beans and 
brown bread what kind of response is that 
mccain who said he does know the difference is turning down 
the rncs offer to pay for his trip 
sen alan simpson of wyoming who expects to speak extensively 
in the west said the surrogate program is a chance to correct what 
he claims are misconceptions among voters that are hurting bush in 
the polls 
a lot of the polls show either twofifths or threefifths of 
the people polled said that dukakis was more conservative than 
bush that isnt a loss of focus thats a loss of your 
eyeglasses simpson said there isnt any way dukakis is going 
to pull that one off

as republican george bush wages an aggressive 
effort to portray michael dukakis as a liberal who is soft on 
crime the man at the center of the vice presidents pitch is 
behind bars in a maryland prison 
convicted murderer and rapist william horton jr is as much a 
part of the debate over crime this presidential campaign season as 
the opposite views on the death penalty espoused by the two 
candidates 
bush now mentions horton by name in campaign rhetoric laced 
with attacks on a massachusetts furlough program that allowed 
horton to be released from prison although he was serving a life 
sentence for murdering a 17yearold boy in 1987 during his 10th 
furlough horton fled to maryland twice raped a woman and 
assaulted her fiance 
i think governor dukakis owes the people of the united states 
an explanation bush said last week in illinois what did the 
democratic governor of massachusetts think he was doing when he let 
convicted firstdegree murderers out on weekend passes 
a day earlier bush was told of dukakis statement that 45 
states and the federal prison system offer some form of furlough 
the vice president responded that none except massachusetts had 
furlough programs for firstdegree murderers 
but according to several correctional associations and 
publications at least 16 states offer furloughs to firstdegree 
murderers massachusetts no longer is among them dukakis 
reluctantly signed a law banning firstdegree lifers from furloughs 
ralph waldo emerson said that foolish consistency is the 
hobgoblin of little minds dukakis said when he signed the bill 
in april i try to listen i try to learn 
since the massachusetts program began in 1972 117700 furloughs 
were granted to 10553 inmates of the 426 escapes 11 occurred 
during the 4908 furloughs granted to firstdegree murderers 
massachusetts actually had a pretty good record said brian 
bemus a researcher at the national institute of corrections data 
center in boulder colo 
bush has amended his attack on the furlough program accurately 
saying in recent days that massachusetts until april had the only 
furlough program in the nation for inmates sentenced to life 
without parole 
campaign aides say the vice president will continue his attack 
he finds this program of furloughing murderers with noparole 
sentences represents the worst sort of approach to crime bush 
spokeswoman alixe glen said friday the furlough issue is 
important because it shows how dukakis record on crime contrasts 
with the vice presidents positions as this issue has been 
elevated i think the american people are shocked at the willie 
horton example 
faced with growing criticism from bush and increased media 
attention on the furlough program the dukakis camp has fired back 
with national furlough statistics showing the massachusetts 
furloughescape rate is below average and by invoking the name of 
bushs boss president reagan who as governor of california 
supported furloughs even after two convicts killed people while on 
furlough in the early 1970s 
like reagan dukakis inherited the furlough program from a 
governor of the opposition party 
these are part and parcel of all kinds of responsible 
correction programs says dukakis who has spent much of the past 
week defending the massachusetts program largely by citing a 14 
percent drop in crime in his state over the past five years 
our view is that the vice president is trying through the 
furlough issue to obscure the facts dukakis issues adviser tom 
herman said in an interview the fact is that while crime is 
going up nationally crime is dropping dramatically in 
massachusetts 
he also is using it to obscure the unenviable crimefighting 
record of the reaganbush administration said herman who spent 
much of last week researching furlough programs bush is reacting 
to this issue in a sense that tells me hes running scared 
if the criticisms continue aides say look for dukakis to adopt 
the strategy he used when former rival sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee criticized the massachusetts furlough program during the 
primary campaign 
al the difference between you and me is that i have to run a 
criminal justice system you never have dukakis said during an 
april debate in new york that kind of response to bush would fit 
in with the dukakis strategy to attempt to characterize bush as a 
donothing vice president 
among corrections officials and criminoligists furloughs are 
considered an effective rehabilitation tool 
most knowledgeable correctional workers prisoners and others 
interested in work furlough see it as a progressive correctional 
program said a 1975 review of one program that of 
thencalifornia gov reagan 
there is no way that were ever going to be 100 percent able 
to give you a program where the parole board or the furlough 
program has fallen down said professor james fox of northeastern 
universitys school of criminal justice 
he also questioned the relevance of the furlough issue in 
presidential politics 
if freeing a murderer on furlough is the issue then its moot 
because murder is except for in rare cases a state crime and the 
president doesnt really deal with murderers fox said

with less than a month to go before the 
democratic national convention incomplete housing arrangements 
threaten the partys hopes for a smooth kickoff to its biggest 
media event of the year 
but some of those who will be covering the gathering say they 
dont expect problems severe enough to be noticed by the democrats 
real audience the millions of american voters who be will 
watching or reading about the convention across the country 
while the city has been sprucing up for the visitors the host 
committee and party organizers sometimes have been slow to provide 
information to reporters and others who have to make arrangements 
of their own said jane maxwell cable news networks vice 
president for special events 
but she said the problems probably wont affect the picture cnn 
presents to the public 
the fact is we have to be ready for the event because they 
arent going to delay it for us she said 
ms maxwell and her counterpart at cbs david buksbaum gave 
convention organizers good marks for helping with television 
coverage the complaints from news organizations center on 
offthefloor matters especially housing 
hotel rooms are really a problem said nbc producer phil 
alongi who said the network has received only a few rooms in 
downtown hotels 
i just cant find enough words to describe how much trouble 
theyre going to be in said mary pat clark the office manager 
of the los angeles times washington bureau who said housing 
arrangements started much later in atlanta than in previous 
convention cities 
the convention has fared better on other fronts 
a newly opened rapid rail station at hartsfield atlanta 
international airport means delegates can reach downtown in 15 
minutes for an 85cent fare those traveling the route by car will 
have to contend with ongoing construction on the i7585 downtown 
connector but the disarray has not proved a major problem to 
larger conventions 
the city long ago gave up on mayor andrew youngs initial hope 
that a renovated underground atlanta entertainment district could 
open in time for the convention but delegates will be offered 
excursions on a steampowered train line newly extended to the 
stone mountain tourist attraction 
once the atlanta hawks were defeated in the national basketball 
association playoffs workers began building the huge stage 
network anchor booths and other fixtures of the convention at the 
omni coliseum 
it does seem finally to be coming together and more and more 
of the details are slowly being revealed said david b cooper 
associate editor of the akron beacon journal and deputy convention 
manager for knightridder inc 
bob murphy a senior producer at abc said we are on schedule 
and theres nothing new from any other convention in dealing with 
democrats they always appear to be somewhat disorganized in the 
very beginning and then everything seems to fall in place 
murphy said his network has rejected some of its assigned hotel 
rooms because they are not close enough for key personnel 
some disputes were inevitable because some of the convention 
hotels are located in the suburbs ms clark who has worked on six 
previous political conventions said the situation was made worse 
when organizers started making assignments much too late 
overbooking can be expected she said leading to a lastminute 
scramble for canceled rooms in atlantas case she said theyre 
going to have chaos 
and if maintenance workers strike the atlanta hilton amp towers 
as threatened in a long labor dispute delegates from california 
tennessee louisiana and wyoming will be looking for new rooms 
convention spokeswoman ruth berry said hotel managers were told 
in an april letter it would be july 11 before housing plans could 
be finalized she said only three of 107 managers responded with 
questions about the arrangements 
but one hotel manager who asked not to be named said i cant 
even get the democrats to return a phone call ive been calling 
them for a week that tells me that they cant tell me anything 
because theyre still confused 
i think its fair to say were behind schedule ms berry 
said were in a different situation than san francisco site of 
the 1984 convention san francisco had a lot more downtown hotel 
rooms but everybody will get one 
wally podrazik codirector of media arrangements and facilities 
and a veteran of three previous conventions says everything will 
be ready in time 
podrazik took over in late may succeeding bob ferrante who was 
dismissed after complaints that the media effort was disorganized 
i was coming in just about when people were giving final 
answers or close to final answers on convention logistics 
podrazik said 
maurice johnson superintendent of the us senate press 
photographers gallery said efforts to coordinate coverage have 
been hampered because of delays in receiving plans for 
photographers 
johnson who has worked on four previous democratic conventions 
in his current position and covered others as a news photographer 
dating back to 1948 said theyre usually hectic but this is a 
lot worse than previous ones

students throwing firebombs and rocks 
battled riot police sunday around the roman catholic cathedral and 
started a blaze in a 15story building after authorities blocked a 
march 
brief running clashes broke out around myongdong cathedral as 
hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and black helmets 
stopped students from marching in the streets 
firebombs hurled by students at police started the blaze in the 
ground floor of an office building smoke poured from two floors as 
firefighters and police extinguished the blaze which apparently 
was started by accident 
the building had been closed and there were no reports of 
injuries from the blaze police officers said offices on the ground 
floor were damaged 
a number of students and police officers were hurt in the 
fighting but there were no figures on injuries or arrests 
radicals called for a major rally and march at the cathedral to 
mark nationwide riots in june 1987 and press for the overthrow of 
the government of president roh taewoo 
but hundreds of police stopped many students from reaching the 
cathedral only about 200 got through the students at the 
cathedral stormed out to break police lines so others could get 
through but they were driven back by tear gas 
radicals use the cathedral as a sanctuary because police do not 
enter for fear of offending public opinion and church authorities 
student leaders addressing the rally in the cathedral grounds 
denounced roh and former president chun doohwan as dictators 
speakers demanded roh and chun be punished for the bloody 
suppression in 1980 of an antigovernment revolt in the southern 
city of kwangju in which at least 191 people were killed 
down with roh taewoo and chun doohwan students shouted 
protesters also chanted yankee go home and speakers charged 
the united states helped suppress the kwangju revolt and backed 
military rule in south korea 
radical groups had called on people to show support for the 
protest by honking car horns and joining the rally but there were 
no signs of public support the radicals are a small minority and 
few south koreans support their demands for reunification of the 
korean peninsula and the withdrawal of us troops from the south 
the students some armed with clubs firebombs and rocks 
started to march out of the cathedral compound protesters leading 
the march hurled firebombs at police blocking surrounding streets 
riot police tossed tear gas grenades and rifle squads fired 
volleys of tear gas to drive back the attacking students 
priests used the cathedrals public address system to appeal to 
students to stop fighting and police to stop firing tear gas both 
sides ignored the appeals 
fighting stopped later as flames and smoke poured from the 
building hit by firebombs

in the early 1970s thengov ronald 
reagan firmly defended a work furlough program for california 
prison inmates that was similar to the massachusetts program that 
vice president george bush has attacked recently 
and just as massachusetts gov michael dukakis today faces 
political criticism for violent crimes committed by inmates on work 
furloughs reagan also faced complaints from conservative 
politicians and police officials that his policies had put 
dangerous criminals on the streets 
like dukakis the expected democratic nominee for president who 
continued a work furlough program started under a governor of the 
opposite party reagan inherited his furlough program from 
democratic gov pat brown 
reagan implemented browns program vigorously and boasted that 
california had one of the most progressive inmate rehabilitation 
programs in the nation and that he was reducing californias prison 
population while other states were struggling with prison 
overcrowding 
but after two inmates were charged with murders committed while 
on work furlough passes reagan fired one top manager of the 
program and closed one of five work furlough centers 
at one point conservative legislators were demanding the 
resignation of reagans director of prisons and the los angeles 
chief of police ed davis who is now a republican state senator 
complained to reagan that about 40 percent of our serious and 
violent offenders are on active parole from your department of 
corrections 
reagan resisted the demands to fire his director of prisons and 
stood behind the furlough program which still operates today under 
slightly more restrictive rules 
in addition to the work furlough program reagan also 
administered a probation subsidy program under which counties were 
paid a 2000 annual bonus for each convicted felon who would 
otherwise go to state prison who they instead placed in a county 
jail or community rehabilitation program 
as a result of the two programs reagan became the only 
california governor in modern times to have the prison population 
decline during his tenure 
bob gore information officer for the california department of 
corrections said during reagans administration inmates with 
clean records in prison were eligible for work furlough even if 
they had committed violent crimes such as murder todays work 
furlough rules exclude inmates convicted of murder and other 
violent crimes 
but the two work furlough cases which resulted in california 
murders in the early 1970s both involved inmates with no history of 
violence a burglar and a forger 
the burglars case came first and attracted the most attention 
because he killed a police officer but the forgers case three 
months later although receiving only minimal public attention 
triggered a shakeup of the california program 
two days after the first murder by a work furlough inmate 
reagan vigorously defended the program during a general news 
conference saying that california was leading the nation in 
rehabilitation but that obviously you cant be perfect 
more than 20000 already have these passes and this was 
the only case of this kind the only murder reagan said 
the first murder was on oct 25 1971 when officer phillip 
riley stopped david brenenstahl who was driving a reported stolen 
car in the exclusive marina del rey district of los angeles as 
riley attempted to handcuff brenenstahl the suspect wrestled the 
officers gun away from him and shot him 
brenenstahl who had been sentenced to state prison three years 
earlier for burglary was on a 72hour work furlough at the time 
and had just obtained a job as a machinist which would have 
qualified him for early release from prison 
brenenstahl was later convicted of seconddegree murder for 
rileys death and sent back to state prison he was paroled in 1981 
the second murder occurred on jan 21 1972 when gerald f 
mitchell and his wife karen were accosted outside their orange 
county apartment by a gunman in a robbery attempt when mitchell 
resisted the robber shot him once in the heart and fled 
the gunman was later identified as william cartwright a 
convicted forger on a work furlough

the defense industry fears that the 
investigation of fraud and bribery in pentagon contracting will 
cause a slowdown in contract awards and new layers of oversight 
but the pentagon says it doesnt expect that fallout any time soon 
we are at least weeks if not months away from the kind of 
evidence which would point to looking at the acquisition process 
for an overhaul says dan howard the pentagons chief 
spokesman 
in the meantime the process of awarding contracts has not 
ground to a halt howard said it couldnt if we continue to 
stay in business 
however industry officials were nearly unanimous in their 
concern about the impact of the probe 
the investigation is very bad news for all of us because of 
the effect its going to have on the reputation of the industry in 
total and because of the stimulus it will provide for additional 
regulations and oversight w b jones a vice president of the 
grumman corp said last week 
well get regulations and stipulations on what consultants may 
do said joseph campbell an aerospace analyst for the paine 
webber group inc 
larry mccracken manager of media relations for raytheon corp 
said most people believe the procurement process will probably 
slow down a bit because of new people being moved into some of the 
positions at the pentagon the whole process mccracken said 
will just be a more cautious process 
several companies are also worried that existing contracts will 
be canceled because of evidence of wrongdoing and they may have 
to rebid projects already under way said herbert c hetu a 
spokesman for the aerospace industries association 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger meanwhile said 
sunday that an earlier study of pentagon contracting found that 
contractors already are overaudited and often dont have the 
opportunity to make adequate profits and he expressed a fear that 
the scandal could lead to cuts in defense spending 
i certainly hope that this is not used as an excuse by the 
professional pentagon bashers for cutting out enough funding for 
the defense of this nation weinberger said on nbctvs meet 
the press 
the investigation of defense fraud started by the naval 
investigative service nearly two years ago and now directed by the 
justice department surfaced on june 14 when fbi agents served more 
than three dozen search warrants around the country 
the warrants named some of the nations largest defense 
contractors along with industry consultants and defense department 
workers among the most prominent of the consultants was melvyn 
paisley who until april 1987 was an assistant secretary of the 
navy 
justice department officials say the inquiry centers on 
allegations that pentagon executives took bribes from private 
military consultants who were selling classified contract 
information to their corporate clients 
to date the pentagons only official response to the 
investigation has been to reassign six officials of the navy and 
air force to other jobs pending the outcome of the investigation 
the reassignments including a man holding the fairly 
highranking position of deputy assistant secretary of the navy 
are not of sufficient number to create important gaps in the 
procurement bureaucracy the services said last week 
we just dont foresee any type of impact on the award of 
contracts because of these moves said lt janet mescus a navy 
spokeswoman 
howard and other officials say the scandal is simply too young 
to directly affect the awarding of contracts with about 60000 
contracts being awarded every work day 153 million contracts 
totaling 1565 billion were distributed in fiscal 1987 there is 
a momentum that is not easily arrested they said 
this is a massive organization howard said it has 50000 
people writing contracts or involved in the contractual process 
another pentagon executive agreed theres no impact on 
awards you cant stop buying fa18s when the navy needs fa18s 
for its carriers it doesnt work that way 
industry officials counter that if they are premature with their 
fears the handwriting is on the wall indeed many say they are so 
concerned that they dont want to talk about the scandal for fear 
of fanning publicity 
one executive demanding anonymity explained here i am 
staring at more competition to begin with because the defense 
budget is being cut facing reduced profit margins because of 
regulatory changes and you want me to talk about a probe that is 
spreading the impression the entire defense industry is crooked no 
thanks 
underscoring the pressures being produced by the investigation 
a senate committee flirted briefly last friday with legislation 
that would have allowed the government to suspend payments to 
defense contractors under investigation in the case 
the committee decided such action would be premature but there 
were predictions the matter would arise again on the senate floor

western sources said sunday that a 
fire at the kabul airport in afghanistan destroyed eight soviet jet 
fighters and may have been the result of an attack by moslem 
guerrillas 
the diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
reports coming in late saturday said eight soviet su25 jet 
fighters exploded one after the other at the northwest end of the 
airport 
a telex report from one western embassy called it one of the 
largest soviet air losses in the war 
the sources said their counterparts in the afghan capital first 
heard of the fire friday morning the explosions and tracerlike 
eruptions indicated the fire also set off some ammunition they 
said 
it looks like a guerrilla attack said one western 
diplomat in islamabad 
he said reliable sources in kabul reported seeing two incoming 
rockets likely fired by insurgents hit theo oga airport about two 
hours after the fire was first noticed 
diplomats said the saturday reports indicated the soviet planes 
were parked almost two miles away from where the rounds hit friday 
soviet and afghan government forces were fighting usbacked 
guerrillas just west of the airport on the northern outskirts of 
the capital diplomats said 
the fire has shut down activities at the airport the sources 
said they said no fixedwing aircraft have been seen landing there 
since the fire began and that one soviet il76 transport plane was 
seen being diverted on approach 
however at least one commercial flight of the afghan airline 
ariana arrived in new delhi from kabul on saturday passengers 
said civil and military planes use the same runways at kabul but 
it was not immediately known how many ariana planes are using the 
airport 
earlier reports had described heavy military traffic at the 
airport as soviets stepped up the resupply of afghan government 
troops when the red army started its ninemonth withdrawal from 
afghanistan on may 15 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 to back 
the kabul government in its war with afghan rebels they began 
withdrawing under an accord signed april 14 in geneva 
guerrillas claimed to have launched rocket attacks on the 
airport last week but not on friday 
in another development afghan and diplomatic sources reported 
rebels shot down an afghan transport plane on june 16 near the 
embattled eastern garrison town of khost 
diplomatic sources said afghans put the casualty toll at 30 to 
40 but were not able to confirm whether all the victims were 
military 
the sources said the incident has reduced the number of 
nighttime flights into khost the flights have been the only means 
to resupply the garrison which is surrounded by guerrillas near 
the pakistan border 
guerrillas have taken dozens of communist posts in eastern 
afghanistan since soviet and afghan government troops began 
redeploying after the geneva accord 
under the agreement the soviets began the ninemonth withdrawal 
on schedule on may 15 the sovietbacked kabul government said only 
soviet troops not soviet military advisers will leave

congress is making decisions about the 120 
billionayear medicare and medicaid programs on the basis of 
federal research that is often delayed or of poor quality the 
general accounting office reported sunday 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said the health care 
financing administration was producing reports that were often 
not fully responsive to congressional needs were frequently late 
and were variable in their technical adequacy 
the gao attributed some of the problems to the lengthy review 
and revision process conducted by administration policy makers both 
inside and outside the health field 
more than 45 million elderly disabled and poor americans rely 
on medicare and medicaid to pay for their health services the 
health care financing administration oversees the two programs 
the financing administration also conducts research at the 
request of congress or the president when cutbacks or changes are 
being contemplated to determine their impact on health care 
recent studies for example have examined the medicare prospective 
payment system for hospitals and state regulations on medigap 
policies that insure people for services uncovered by medicare 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on human resources said the gao report 
raises serious questions about how important decisions affecting 
health care are made 
if policies are made on the basis of inadequate or misleading 
information or if the information needed is not provided on time 
then we can expect health care to deteriorate weiss who 
requested the report said in a statement 
the gao said concerns about the quality of health care financing 
administration research had been expressed since 1980 by congress 
congressional agencies the department of health and human 
services and others it said quality had not improved much in the 
last eight years 
part of the reason the gao said was that congress was 
mandating more and more studies while the administration was 
reducing the health care agencys staff and resources 
the gao studied three areas and made the following comments 
relevance the office said that reports to congress suffered 
from a combination of vague mandates lack of formal communications 
between lawmakers and researchers and administration reviewers who 
deleted relevant information on the basis of policy considerations 
timeliness the gao found that of 28 reports due before the 
summer of 1986 26 were delivered late or were still overdue the 
lateness was attributed primarily to a reviewrevision cycle 
involving officials at the health care financing agency the 
department of health and human services and the office of 
management and budget reviews often have lasted for months or 
even years the agency said 
technical quality of research more than onethird of the 
projects awarded by the health care financing agency in one year 
were disapproved by review panels on the basis of technical 
inadequacy the gao found this was blamed on a flawed award 
process and a finding that a technical perspective did not always 
dominate reviews by the health care financing agency the 
department of health and human services and the office of 
management and budget 
the deputy administrator of the health care financing agency 
glenn hackbarth denied that his agency has been improperly 
influenced by policy considerations 
obviously on policy issues we do have a policy perspective 
that we advocate i dont think thats unfair he said i do 
not think there are instances where we have tried to mislead 
congress by deleting relevant factual technical information 
hackbarth said that congress rather than the review process is 
to blame for tardy reports he said lawmakers require long lists of 
studies without considering the money or staff available to do them 
it should be no surprise to anyone that there are more studies 
than there are resources and the end result is late reports he 
said 
hackbarth admitted that his agency has sometimes awarded grant 
money to projects that are technically weak but said it has been 
done when the agency had virtually no alternative 
we can either not do any research on a pressing problem or we 
can decide to go ahead with a proposal that is not technically 
everything we would like it to be he said sometimes we do the 
latter and i think it is entirely defensible 
the gao report recommended a number of steps it believes the 
department of health and human services should take among them an 
assessment of whether health care financing agency has enough staff 
and resources to handle the reports mandated by congress and sought 
by the administration it also said the department should develop a 
formalized review process to ensure timely delivery of reports and 
make sure there is better communication between researchers and 
lawmakers

jets it is designed to replace

the communist party conference opening tuesday 
could play a role in changing the nature of the party and making it 
more responsive to the people than it has been since it came to 
power in 1917 
proposals to be discussed at the 19th allunion party conference 
could if accepted by delegates limit the power of the 
20millionmember organization and that of its general secretary 
and chief reformer mikhail s gorbachev 
it is high time party workers stopped doing the work of 
economic managers and stopped interfering in daytoday production 
activity gorbachev told leningrad party workers in october 
instead he said the party should focus on politics and ideology 
the party has been searching its soul since gorbachev launched 
his perestroika or restructuring program in april 1985 the 
results are proposals that sociologist and gorbachev supporter 
tatyana zaslavskaya has said would have caused mass shock three 
years ago 
the conference is expected to examine the possible reforms 
called theses that could shift the partys focus from 
running the daytoday soviet economy and bureaucracy to a more 
purely political role of winning the peoples hearts and minds 
the reforms are aimed at eliminating the heavyhanded 
centralized administration introduced by dictator josef stalin in 
the 1920s and at dismantling the cult of personality associated 
with almost every soviet leader since then 
if conference members support the suggested legal reforms their 
party would be more open to the people than it has been since 
taking power in the bolshevik revolution of 1917 
many of the new theses are designed to revive the days when 
vladimir ilyich lenin led the revolution and created a communist 
party that set general policy and left daytoday affairs to a 
network of soviets or local governing councils 
todays communist party does much more it administers the 
government fills bureaucratic posts and tells workers what to do 
since stalin instituted fiveyear economic plans in 1928 party 
officials have set production quotas and pressured everyone from 
government ministers to factory and farm managers to meet them 
the proposed theses say the partys new assignment is to work 
out a theory and strategy of social development domestic and 
foreign policy and the ideology of socialist rejuvenation 
theses to be examined at the conference include 
encouraging freer debates at party meetings where the party 
leader now speaks first and delegates rarely offer criticisms or 
suggestions of their own 
tightening party membership requirements to draw only really 
worthy people with superior political moral and business 
qualities and reviewing all 20 million members 
sociologist zaslavskaya has complained the proposal doesnt make 
clear who is to conduct this review and warns of possible abuses 
expansion of multicandidate elections conducted by secret 
ballot for officials to the central committee 
another proposal is designed to make officials more accountable 
for their work by limiting party officials to two fiveyear terms 
and legislators to one fiveyear term the new proposal could 
limit the term of gorbachev himself as the partys general 
secretary 
the limit on terms is bound to anger officials who spent years 
accumulating power and privilege in 1961 the late premier nikita 
s khrushchev persuaded the party to pass a similar rule and it 
contributed to his ouster three years later the rule was later 
revoked

iraq said its troops sunday drove out the 
last iranian occupiers from its southern howeizah marshes iran 
claimed iraq used poison gas in the battle and in another attack 
killing 60 people and injuring 4000 
the marshes were held by iran since 1984 and were irans last 
foothold in southern iraq it was iraqs third major land victory 
since april in the nearly 8yearold war and president saddam 
hussein was quoted as calling it the last of the difficult 
battles and predicting final victory soon 
iraqi officers who took part in an assault saturday said 
paratroopers were dropped behind iranian lines to cut them off 
while ground forces moved eastward 
the iraqi 3rd army corps spearheaded by units of the elite 
presidential guard drove the iranians back across the border and 
pursued them into iran 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia quoted a 
military communique as saying the iraqi forces withdrew into iraq 
on sunday 
fighting still raged sunday in the marshes east of the tigris 
river and 80 miles north of basra but by all accounts the main 
battle was over 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
nicosia acknowledged that iraqis had gained control of the 
majnoon islands in the swamplands and pushed its forces out of the 
majnoon sector 
but it charged the iraqis seized the islands through extensive 
use of chemical weapons to force irans combatants to retreat 
irna said that iraqi warplanes also dropped bombs containing 
nerve cyanide and mustard gases saturday near the southwestern oil 
city of ahvaz 60 miles east of the marshes killing 60 people and 
injuring 4000 
the iraqi agency quoted an unidentified authoritative source 
in baghdad as denying chemicals weapons were used 
iraqi military communiques saturday said fighterbombers 
attacked military targets southwest of ahvaz to prevent iran from 
moving up troops to reinforce its beleaguered majnoon garrison 
iran has repeatedly accused iraqi of using chemical weapons in 
the 8yearold iraniraq war chemical weapons were outlawed under 
a 1925 geneva treaty 
iran claimed its antiaircraft gunners shot down an iraqi jet 
saturday iraq denied losing any planes 
the iraqis displaying a new aggressiveness after six years of 
defensive warfare recaptured the faw peninsula in southern iraq on 
april 18 and drove the iranians out of a bridgehead east of the 
port city of basra on may 25 
irna said iranian fighterbombers attacked iraqi troop 
concentrations and strongpoints around majnoon on sunday 
inflicting heavy casualties and losses 
the iraqi agency said that the 6th army corps launched a 
secondary offensive in the howeizah sector sunday mopping up 
pockets of iranian resistance and overrunning sand embankments 
built by the iranians as a last line of defense near the border 
the new push ended the enemy presence in the region the 
iraqi agency quoted a military communique as saying 
the iraqis claimed large numbers of iranians were killed or 
wounded in the majnoon fighting with more than 2000 captured 
along with big quantities of weapons and other equipment 
the loss of the majnoon islands a network of sandy islets 
linked by earthen causeways and pontoon bridges in the 
1000squaremile marshes means irans only bridgehead remaining 
in iraq is territory iran seized in the northern kurdistan 
mountains in recent months 
western military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the iraqis heavily outnumbered the iranian defenders in 
majnoon

democrats headed home early sunday after producing 
the partys shortest platform in decades in a spirit of harmony 
that left jesse jacksons forces talking unity and michael dukakis 
campaign satisfied there was nothing in the document to embarrass 
the likely nominee 
the democratic platform committee wrapped up work in a marathon 
session saturday night on a party blueprint for what it calls the 
restoration of competence and hope 
michael dukakiss delegates easily turned aside jackson efforts 
to add planks that would have committed the democrats to raise 
taxes on the wealthy freeze the pentagon budget double education 
spending commit the united states to nofirstuse of nuclear 
weapons and call for palestinian selfdetermination 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons platform chief said sunday no 
decisions had been made on which if any of the issues jackson will 
fight for on the floor of next months convention in atlanta 
she said jackson himself must make that decision taking into 
account not only gains he made on both the partys platform and 
rules for 1992 but how he sees his own future politically 
as it stands the broadbrush moderate platform makes no 
dollarsandcents promises but vows the democrats will restore 
competence caring and incorruptibility to washington and 
reverse seven years of voodoo economics trickle down 
policies and fiscal irresponsibility 
theres nothing in the document with which he disagrees 
said dukakis issues director christopher edley who observed that 
on issues such as acid rain health care and defense the platform 
is less specific than the massachusetts governor has been 
but if the entire platform was tailored to suit dukakis many 
passages also bore jacksons stamp from its call for an indexed 
minimum wage to its declaration that south africa is a terrorist 
state to a slap at corporate raiders and to a commitment to 
sameday and mailin voter registration 
although we have differences about 95 percent of all the 
issues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolved 
in a peaceful and in a unified way and i know that scares the 
republicans to death former gary ind mayor richard hatcher 
said late saturday shortly before the panel finished its work 
it was hatcher who offered the first minority amendment 
saturday a shotgun jackson budget plan that would have raised the 
tax rate on 600000 upperincome americans from 28 to 50 percent 
and frozen the pentagon budget for five years it went down 
10844 in the only standup vote the committee took 
the committee handled without rancor nearly a score of other 
amendments by voice votes rejecting some key jackson stands but 
accepting others including ones calling for third world debt 
relief and significant increases in child care aid for low and 
middleincome families 
paul g kirk jr the party chairman exulted that the platform 
committee had followed his instructions to avoid a litany of 
social cultural or ideological buzzwords 
common sense politics has given us a short statement of 
principle all democrats can run on in november kirk said in a 
statement from washington 
mike barnes the former maryland congressman who led dukakiss 
platform team told reporters that in working on the past four 
party platforms i have never seen a situation that was anywhere 
near this united 
he said it showed the democratic party really has matured and 
is ready to take the reins of government 
there may be in atlanta some further discussion of these 
issues barnes predicted thats normal but im confident that 
if there is it will be done in the same spirit we saw here in 
denver 
norton a georgetown university law professor and former 
chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission said 
jackson lost on the centerpiece of his campaign the budget plan 
for tax hikes and a military freeze but won on the second most 
important issue south africa 
she said some of the issues it lost on were important but not 
central to jacksons campaign but she declined to be specific 
in weighing floor fights she said we ought to look at the 
effect it will have on the convention itself will it be divisive 
for no important reason is it worth the tradeoff in divisiveness 
does the issue need the open and visible support of a 
convention or would it only be icing 
there have indeed been significant differences between jesse 
jackson and michael dukakis during this campaign she said 
those did not evaporate at mackinac and denver what did happen 
however is that the governor and the reverend in these proceedings 
moved closer together 
the committee staff was still working sunday to finalize the 
language of the amended platform which will not be final until 
approved by the convention in atlanta on july 19 
but it was expected to run around 4000 words a tenth the size 
of the 1980 and 1984 platforms and the shortest since the terse 
platforms that franklin d roosevelt ran on in 1932 and 1936

police were scrutinizing remnants of a crude 
homemade bomb tossed at the home of rapist lawrence singletons 
brother but had no idea sunday who hurled the explosive in a 
normally quiet tampa suburb 
walter singleton and his wife dianne were alone in their house 
when the bomb exploded saturday night in their front yard about 30 
feet from the front door said hillsborough county sheriffs 
spokesman debbie carter they were uninjured 
bomb squad experts were looking for fingerprints and other clues 
sunday on bomb bits picked out of the lawn she said 
our bomb squad has the fragments that are left we think it 
was a homemade device she said we found pieces of cardboard 
and duct tape were processing them so hopefully well be able to 
tell something from that 
there were no arrests by midday sunday and no one saw the bomb 
tossed 
singleton was convicted of raping a 15yearold hitchhiker 
chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead in a 
ditch southeast of san francisco in 1978 the girl survived 
a 60yearold former merchant seaman who grew up in tampa 
lawrence singleton spent eight years of a 14year sentence in a 
california prison 
he completed a yearlong probation and is now free to live where 
he pleases during his probation he was forced to live in a 
trailer on the grounds of san quentin prison grounds because of 
bitter protest in several communities that were proposed as homes 
for him 
the blast left an impression about four feet across in the yard 
but no damage to the house that singleton listed with state 
officials as his florida address said sheriffs maj ron 
poindexter 
at first we thought it was a lightning bolt then we looked 
out of our window and saw smoke said neighbor harrie grimes 
neighbors happened to see a red vehicle in the area but 
authorities dont know if it was the same one from which the bomb 
was hurled ms carter said 
since lawrence singleton registered his brothers address with 
the state neighbors have been frightened and upset a local 
businessman and a radio station have each offered singleton 5000 
if he will pack up and go anywhere else 
walter singleton says his brother lives about two hours away 
from here but refuses to say exactly where 
ms carter said it was unclear if the bombing would further 
upset residents of the forest hills neighborhood 
its too early to tell if this is going to add fuel to the 
fire so to speak she said we have patrols in the area that 
make periodic checks on mr singletons home

two years ago an editor besieged by jim 
fitts letters to his newspaper suggested that the retired 
agriculture teacher start up his own publication to voice his 
opinions 
fitts took the advice and today his fledgling weekly is in the 
midst of a legal battle involving first amendment rights 
fitts the 62yearold editor of williamsburg countys the voice 
newspaper not only stirred up the political powers that be in this 
poor rural county of some 40000 people his denunciation of two 
politicians and subsequent arrest on criminal libel charges caught 
the attention of journalists around the country 
fitts has gone to jail once and could go again for expressing 
his opinion in a newspaper he awaits word monday on whether he has 
been indicted by a williamsburg county grand jury on criminal libel 
charges 
if indicted and convicted he faces a fine of up to 5000 and a 
year in jail 
clearly weve got a political commentator making a political 
statement about two politicians said jane kirtley executive 
director of the reporters committee for freedom of the press in 
washington it seems to me that punishing someone for speaking is 
not an american concept 
but fitts targets see something more in the caustic column he 
wrote before the june 14 primary elections 
state rep bj gordon and state sen frank mcgill say fitts 
attacks in which he accuses them of stealing and corruption 
without offering evidence are lying hurtful shots that deserve to 
be punished 
freedom of the press is not to go around with freedom and 
accuse people of committing crimes gordon said 
the two politicians have brought what is believed to be only the 
fourth criminal libel suit in south carolina in 40 years and the 
first in the nation since 1984 
although civil libel cases are not unusual and often result in 
the awarding of monetary damages to the aggrieved party criminal 
libel cases are rare because they can send a journalist to jail 
fitts who spent 13 years as an agriculture teacher in dillon 
and north myrtle beach and 20 years as clemson universitys 
agricultural extension agent in williamsburg county retired in 
1986 and began sending letters to the countys only newspaper over 
a controversial school board issue 
after a while he said the editor suggested fitts needed his 
own paper to publish his opinions 
i said thats a good idea i hadnt thought about that 
he recalled in an interview thursday 
roughly six months later in january 1987 a new weekly began 
rolling off the presses and from the beginning it expressed fitts 
outspoken style 
ive always been opinionated he said i just have an 
opinion and i have no problem sharing it 
he may have a problem sharing it for a while however the judge 
who set his bond also put him under a gag order forbidding him to 
discuss his arrest he spent a weekend in jail under 40000 bond 
before he was released on his own recognizance 
gordon and mcgill think fitts crossed the line with a may 17 
column in which he wrote i will say to you without fear of 
contradiction if every black in williamsburg county would start 
stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives 
they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their 
time in power 
the column gave no specifics and when asked what he thought 
they had stolen he said only that they had taken the pride of 
people of williamsburg county 
he stressed that he was not apologizing for what he wrote but 
acknowledged that he could have chosen his words better 
im not trained as a journalist i dont know how to polish 
things he said maybe if i had polished it i could have 
gotten it across better 
fitts who is black has said that the dispute with the two 
politicians is economic not racial gordon is black and mcgill is 
white the voice with a circulation of 2300 has a largely black 
readership 
despite what people like kirtley say gordon and mcgills lawyer 
said the criminal libel law is still a good one 
i dont think the press has been fair in the matter said 
attorney wallace connor i can understand they want to 
protect themselves 
there is a statute in this state against libel and slander 
they the media say that its antiquated but as long as its a 
law it ought to be obeyed connor said 
also if its antiquated the ten commandments are antiquated 
because they were written 5000 years ago and it says thou shalt 
not bear false witness he said

half the children who enter the chicago public 
school system are unable to say their first and last names or to 
speak in complete simple sentences a new survey of kindergarten 
teachers indicates 
also most of the youngsters are also unable to identify basic 
shapes such as squares and circles hold a pencil or crayon 
correctly sit still to listen to a brief story or settle disputes 
without physical aggression the survey found 
the findings published sunday in the chicago suntimes 
resulted from a poll in late may by the newspaper indicating that 
chicagos public schools are overwhelmed with many lowincome 
children who start kindergarten unprepared for basic classroom 
learning 
the sad thing is these kids are not only illiterate theyre 
incompetent said philanthropist irving harris who has sponsored 
innovative preschool programs for families at the robert taylor 
homes public housing project 
theres a difference harris said you dont have to be 
literate to have common sense sense and be able to do things 
the newspaper also surveyed kindergarten teachers in the 
affluent suburb of wilmette where the vast majority of children 
entering their classes could perform all of the basic tasks 
the survey also found that the overwhelming majority of wilmette 
kindergartners had been read to by their parents and taken to a 
zoo library or museum but most chicago kindergartners had not 
enjoyed those experiences 
based on estimates given by their teachers 51 percent of 
chicago kindergartners percent could not tell both their first and 
last names compared with only 3 percent in wilmette 52 percent in 
chicago could not speak in complete sentences compared with 8 
percent in wilmette and 59 percent in chicago could not identify a 
square circle and triangle compared with 18 percent in wilmette 
the newspaper said 
half to nearly threefourths of the chicago kindergartners also 
could not indentify primary colors draw a recognizable human 
figure or tell a story with a beginning middle and end 
teachers were asked to give the total number of children they 
teach and then estimate what percentage could do various things at 
the beginning of the school year 
chicago schools supt manford byrd jr said the results 
reflected a failed social policy in which the schools are 
expected to make up for the neglect and lack of support lowincome 
families face the survey proved that there should be more state 
support for preschool programs for children from lowincome 
families he said 
in chicago 74 percent of the pupils in the survey were from 
lowincome families compared with only 4 percent in wilmette 
the suntimes said it conducted a random sampling may 20 to 26 
of chicago kindergarten teachers receiving responses from 196 of 
the 285 teachers who were sent questionnaires those responding 
teach 7122 children or 24 percent of the citywide kindergarten 
enrollment 
four of the six kindergarten teachers in wilmette responded to 
the 45item questionnaire the newspaper did not estimate a margin 
of error for the survey

the boy scouts have rescued this isolated 
city from the possibility that it would run out of drinking water 
by the end of a droughtbaked summer 
a 2milelong 8inch pipeline planned to be finished in a few 
weeks will link a boy scout camp reservoir with an undersized 
rundown municipal water system the scouts are letting the town 
have the water for free 
it gets a little thirsty around here when it doesnt rain 
alan birket city water supervisor said last week 
the scout organization agreed to help last october after the 
town of about 5000 in a coastal valley 120 miles north of san 
francisco declared a state of emergency officials expected the 
citys reservoir to run out by thanksgiving 
a convoy of trucks from a variety of government agencies hauled 
in pipe loaned by the state forklifts from private companies 
unloaded it workers from the state conservation youth corps began 
clamping it together all was at no cost to the ranching community 
in mendocino county 
then the rains came so the pipeline was left unfinished 
however only twothirds of the normal 50 inches fell not enough 
to ward off fears that the city could run dry this summer 
now the city plans to finish the pipeline and begin pumping 
water before its reservoir is drawn too far down 
but some folks think the pipeline should already have been 
completed in willits the only california city thats declared a 
state of emergency because of the drought 
people are always talking about it its not even finished 
its just sitting out there said kelli fuller a 30yearold 
waitress at moms place on main street which is also us 101 
people arent really worried though she added plunking down 
glasses of water for two customers who hadnt asked for them in 
violation of voluntary city conservation rules she explained with 
a shrug its hot today 
water conservation will shift from voluntary to mandatory 
friday city manager bill van orden said people who wash cars or 
hose driveways can be fined 500 sprinklers also will be shut off 
at some city parks 
if you waste water you have neighbors telling on you he 
said 
voluntary measures van orden said have cut average daily water 
usage significantly because the city officials asking for 
cutbacks are residents nextdoor neighbors not people they dont 
know like in larger cities 
were all running around with dirty cars and not watering our 
yards in the daytime said elin crawford an adult education 
teacher 
the drought has worsened water problems willits already faced 
but the city is working to ensure that the headaches dont persist 
the city has secured 33 million in state loans to improve its 
water system and expand its reservoir

soviet jews demanding the right to emigrate 
gathered on a moscow street sunday but within minutes their 
posters were ripped down and police took away the groups leader 
yuri semenovsky and about 10 other soviet jews came to the 
arbat a bustling pedestrian mall in central moscow to protest 
legislation they say prevents them from leaving the country 
soviet officials say the only bar to emigration is knowledge of 
state secrets but semenovsky and the others said they cannot leave 
because of a law requiring documentation that they dont owe money 
to relatives or exspouses 
a law passed in august 1986 requires that the documentation be 
provided by wouldbe emigrants relatives semenovsky said soviet 
citizens have no legal way to make a relative provide such 
information 
the courts are no help said the former mathematician who 
lost his job when he applied to leave the country more than two 
years ago they have been told not to get involved in cases 
involving refuseniks more than 200000 soviet jews want to leave 
but cant 
at 4 pm semenovsky and the others members of a refusenik 
group called the poor relatives assembled in front of a building 
on the arbat they taped four small posters on the wooden fence 
that surrounds the building 
one read if you want to know the truth about refuseniks and 
not the usual lies and filth from the newspapers and central 
television read the informational leaflet from the poor 
relatives group 
scores of soviets assembled to scan the posters 
ten minutes after the posters went up two men dressed in

the national ywca facing a court battle over a 
washington state chapters decision to hire a man as a leader has 
voted to retain the allfemale status it has held for 130 years 
its national president said sunday 
but the organizations board of directors postponed a vote on 
whether to expel the tacoma wash chapter for hiring a man as 
executive director said president glendora mcilwain putnam 
the chapter has sued to remain a part of the national 
organization which concluded its 31st national convention sunday 
at a downtown hotel 
at the fiveday meeting an estimated 1200 delegates from local 
chapters across the country voted overwhelmingly to continue to 
exclude men as full voting members ms putnam said 
it is now more important than ever that the ywca remain an 
autonomous womens membership movement because of the serious 
challenges which confront women in the areas of employment 
housing childcare and poverty she said 
the ywcas position is an affirmative response to inequity and 
disparity which continue to be the rule rather than the 
exception she said 
the young womens christian association in the united states was 
founded in 1858 as an organization exclusively for women partly to 
address the problems of housing povertylevel wages and 
educational opportunities for young women who flocked to cities 
during the industrial revolution 
the fundamental focus of our organization has been the same 
the empowerment of women and girls making them more in 
control of their lives ms putnam said 
under the groups constitution men can participate as 
associates but not as full voting members the constitution also 
says that executive directors should be full voting members said 
spokeswoman claire carroll 
earlier this year the odgen utah chapter became the first in 
the country to lose its affiliation for allowing men to join as 
full members the chapter still has time to reconsider its action 
before it is barred from using the ywca name and logo ms putnam 
said 
although recent court decisions have forced several formerly 
allmale groups such as the jaycees to admit women ms putnam said 
she does not consider the ywca policy discriminatory 
those earlier court rulings have been aimed at allowing women 
into places where business is discussed she said 
were not a marketplace issue we dont come to the ywca to 
discuss business ms putnam said rather the ywca offers 
services aimed solely at women such as childcare programs for 
battered women and fitness classes she said 
women need a place where they can be comfortable expressing 
their problems their fears the way they face the world they need 
to discuss it with other women she said 
pene modahl president of the tacoma chapters board of 
directors has said that hiring alan tiger as executive director 
will not hurt that goal she called him the best possible 
candidate who happened to be a man 
the tacoma chapter filed suit june 10 in pierce county wash 
superior court seeking to bar the national board from expelling it 
ms putnam said she did not know when the board would vote on 
whether to expel the chapter but guessed that it might happen at 
the next board meeting in october 
tiger 36 who was hired in may has vowed that the chapter will 
retain its commitment to women we have to ask ourselves when in 
the womens movement do we stop talking about men and women and 
start to talk about humanity he said

end a 5yearold feud over who would control the palestinian 
movement

returning from vienna that they were beaten by austrian police when 
they demonstrated against pope john paul iis meetings with 
austrian president kurt waldheim

airport and also said they encountered antisemitism from some 
austrians during their weekend of protests in vienna 
rabbi avi weiss of the riverdale synagogue in new york said he 
and three students were beaten by police after they displayed a 
large photograph of waldheim in a nazi uniform at mauthausen a 
former concentration camp that the pope visited 
we felt the popes visit to mauthausen was obscene after 
he embraced waldheim whose hands are red with jewish blood weiss 
said this is an effort by the pope to dejudaize the holocaust

during his visit to the former nazi camp though he mentioned by 
name some catholics who died there 
jewish organizations have charged that waldheim who was in the 
german army in world war ii was involved in war crimes 
he denies the allegations but was barred from visiting the 
united states after the us government found evidence waldheim was 
involved in deporting balkan citizens during the war 
the men with weiss were eyal shenzer leader of a jewish student 
group jacob davidson head of the jewish student organization of 
north america and glen richter coordinator of the new york

the national conference of catholic 
bishops paused sunday for prayer and relaxation before turning from 
a debate on nuclear policy to one on the morality of teaching about 
aids prevention 
the roman catholic bishops held a public mass sunday morning and 
scheduled a cookout and prayer session in the evening a day after 
approving a report that critics said was not strong enough in 
urging disarmament 
the report approved by a strong voice vote of the approximately 
280 bishops opposed deployment of president reagans proposed 
strategic defense initiative but it did not question the morality 
of continuing research on the star wars missile defense system 
within the bound of existing arms treaties 
the bishops planned to end their fourday meeting at st johns 
university here monday by taking up a paper that says teaching 
about condom use would help prevent the spread of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
some bishops oppose the statement saying it will be 
misinterpreted as condoning sex outside of marriage and the use of 
artificial birth control both contrary to roman catholic doctrine 
the report on nuclear policy was approved as an update to the 
bishops 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear deterrence 
the new report says it is our prudential judgment that 
proposals to press development of sdi do not measure up to the 
moral criteria outlined in this report 
the report recommended that defense spending as a whole not 
absorb a morally disproportionate percentage of the federal 
budget 
the rev thomas gumbleton auxiliary bishop of detroit and the 
head of the peace group pax christi usa said he will continue to 
work for the day when the bishops will say unequivocably that a 
policy of nuclear deterrence is immoral 
gumbleton estimated that 50 to 60 of the bishops at the 
conference feel the way he does he said he and other bishops are 
planning to issue their own statement on deterrence as a supplement 
to the conference report 
this report should not be the last word we say on nuclear 
deterrence said cardinal joseph bernardin archbishop of 
chicago who chaired the committee that wrote the report 
benedictine sister ann malerich a member of pax christi called 
the report a step in the right direction 
weapons arent the answer said lucille kuhl of rochester a 
former coordinator of pax christi they havent solved a problem 
yet why not try something else maybe we as a people have to be 
more active in speaking out rather than leaving it to our 
bishops 
in other business saturday the bishops approved a campaign to 
raise 20 million for retirement funds 
many orders cant afford to support older members because fewer 
younger people are joining and the cost of care is escalating it 
costs 400 million annually to care for the 40000 men and women in 
religious orders who are 70 years and older according to sister 
oliver hudon the head of the churchs retirement project

vice president george bush on sunday 
accused congress of inaction in the fight against drugs but a 
representative of democrat michael dukakis immediately turned the 
blame on the reagan administration 
in speeches at a conference of the fraternal order of police 
bush and dukakis supporter sen dennis deconcini dariz each 
laid the blame for failing to quell the drug crisis at the others 
doorstep 
bush the certain republican presidential nominee also said he 
would be tough in prosecution of drug dealers and would convert 
unneeded military bases into minimum security prisons he said he 
had no specific bases in mind but would expect his secretary of 
defense to review the matter 
on the drug issue bush said congress is full of rhetorical 
heroes on the issue of drugs but when it comes to law enforcement 
some of them go awol short for absent without leave 
he said congress reduced the administrations coast guard budget 
request last year by 72 million and by 864 million over four 
years 
but deconcini claimed it was the administration that did the 
cutting and congress that restored dollars for drugfighting 
efforts he said the reagan administrations 1988 budget sought a 
900 million cut in antidrug funds including money for coast 
guard and border patrol interdiction efforts it also included a 60 
percent cut in drug prevention and education programs 
deconcini said congress restored 70 percent of the funds and he 
labeled bushs claim of congressional laxity as just a bogus 
argument 
in a prepared statement deconcini also accused bush of personal 
failure as head of the national narcotics border interdiction 
system 
deconcini said the panel was found to be an organization of 
halfempty offices lacking organization and added that it 
virtually ignored the air charters that are the most commmon 
means of smuggling cocaine into southern florida 
deconcini said he was addressing the group as a surrogate for 
dukakis who has sewn up the democratic presidential nomination and 
is spending a few days vacationing in nantucket mass 
in a news conference after his speech bush debunked a report 
that his aides have zeroed in on sen bob dole of kansas as the 
leading candidate to become bushs running mate 
nobody is authorized to peak in my behalf bush said of the 
report in sundays new york times 
we have not begun the process in terms of lists he said 
there isnt a long list or a short list 
dole while campaigning for bush on saturday in oregon was 
asked about chances he would be the running mate and said if i 
got the call id say mr vice president lets talk but that 
hasnt happened 
discussing what he will look for in a running mate bush said 
i want to have an inclusion of the vice president on things that 
suggests a certain philosophical compatibility not on every single 
issue but a philosophical compatibility and a tempermental 
compatibility so youre not looking over wondering if the vice 
president is posturing and cutting up the president 
in his remarks to the police group bush called for mandatory 
testing of anyone responsible for the public safety 
recriminalization of drug possession in states where it has been 
decriminalized the death penalty for drug kingpins and those who 
commit drugrelated murders and continuation of the zero 
tolerance policy aimed at users of drugs in even small amounts

melvyn r paisley a central figure in the 
growing pentagon fraud scandal was able to win a top defense 
department post despite widespread allegations that he had bribed 
government officials and wiretapped competitors according to a 
published report 
the los angeles times reported sunday that two executives of the 
boeing co had sought to get paisley fired from his job 10 years 
ago because they were alarmed about his conduct which they said 
included charging fees for prostitutes to his expense account 
usually every major company has one guy who does the dirty 
business former boeing executive james durst told the times 
he was the guy 
durst in a telephone interview with the associated press 
thursday night said he passed along information to the government 
more than six years ago that paisley had bragged of committing a 
felony wiretapping operation and of committing bribery 
internationally on military projects 
lawrence e barcella paisleys lawyer called the allegations 
unfounded and suggested they came from people with axes of 
their own to grind he called durst a disgruntled exemployee 
i just really think that dredging up 5 10 and 15yearold 
unproven and unfounded allegations is really stooping beneath 
the barrel barcella said 
calls to a boeing spokesman were not immediately returned 
paisleys reputation has been that of a fastliving playboy who 
left behind a string of allegations of questionable conduct 
durst described paisley as a harddrinking twofisted mans 
man who would stop at nothing to get his way he loved to talk 
he loved to brag mel had certain priorities women money and 
business particularly women he said 
the latest revelations about paisleys past raise questions 
about how he could have passed fbi background checks necessary to 
become assistant secretary of the navy in 1981 with access to the 
governments highest secrets about weapons and reconnaissance 
satellites 
one of paisleys three exwives mildred r mcgetrick said she 
told the fbi at the time that paisley was dishonest with money 
and had accepted cash and gifts as gratuities mcgetricks sister 
mickey pierson said she had sent a letter to thensenate armed 
services committee chairman john tower saying that mr paisley 
has been known to take bribes towers panel was then considering 
paisleys nomination as a top aide to navy secretary john lehman 
the times said paisley who worked for boeing for 27 years had 
hired james e gaines while a boeing executive and later brought 
him to the pentagon as a deputy after paisley left the defense 
department gaines stayed with the navy and is suspected of having 
supplied classified material to paisley who used it in his 
consulting work 
paisleys office and home were searched by the fbi as part of 
the investigation into the alleged bribery scandal no one has been 
charged in the case 
durst said paisley loved to brag and had told colleagues about 
bugging a competitor for a military contract in 1970 about bribing 
us military officers overseas and about hiding payoffs and wild 
parties with prostitutes on his militarycontract expense reports 
when he went to work for lehman people used to laugh and say 
he wont last six months durst said as soon as they do a 
security check hell be out i guess they never did we never 
thought hed last 
durst said at one point a prominent boeing consultant in 
australia sir edwin hicks complained that paisley was so blatant 
in his offers of payoffs there that paisley was made persona non 
grata in australia 
information is the essence of the business durst said 
there are good ways to do it and bad ways mel unfortunately 
always used the bad ways

a special general assembly session on 
disarmament ended in failure sunday after delegates failed to adopt 
a final document on nuclear arms reduction 
the session ended sunday morning after committee meetings could 
not end differences in disarmament positions held by the soviet 
union and developing nations and a more cautious approach backed by 
the united states and some of its western allies 
the fourweek session of the 159member general assembly the 
third in 10 years to focus on disarmament cost the financially 
ailing united nations about 74 million 
delegates never voted on a final document committee delegates 
decided not to attempt to pass a resolution without consensus 
the general assembly has no enforcement power over its 
decisions delegates believed a final resolution adopted by 
consensus however would carry the moral authority of expressing 
the will of the world community 
the united states and some of its western allies opposed most 
other nations on issues ranging from the us spacebased defense 
program known as star wars the monitoring of landbased 
weapons and a soviet call for a joint ussoviet nuclear test ban 
un officials described the past weeks committee debates as 
very intense and arduous some delegates said there were sharp 
confrontations and shouting in at least one closed session 
a certain country which should have important disarmament 
responsibilities had insisted on its position that was a major 
reason that consensus was not achieved said chinese delegate yu 
mengyia referring to the united states 
soviet union delegate vladimir f petrovsky also noted that no 
agreement was possible because of the actions of some states 
us delegate max friedersdorf said the united states 
regretted very much that it had not been possible to achieve 
consensus on the chairmans draft document which had been 
acceptable in large part to most delegations 
during the special session the soviets called for the 
elimination of all nuclear weapons by the end of the century troop 
reductions of 500000 soldiers each by the warsaw pact and nato and 
a ban on star wars 
since the session began may 31 the united states was also at 
odds with other positions favored by the soviet union including an 
expanded role for the united nations in multilateral verification 
of nuclear weapons and naval nuclear disarmament 
the united states favored emphasis on conventional disarmament 
especially in europe where the warsaw pact is regarded as having 
military superiority

republican george bush criticized michael dukakis understanding 
of foreign policy on sunday saying his democratic rival comes to a 
troubling conclusion in emphasizing conventional weapons 
backers of jesse jackson and dukakis struck a unified note this 
weekend in agreeing on a party platform noteworthy for its brevity 
the vice president said dukakis lack of experience in foreign 
policy is fertile ground for debate and bush said he will spell out 
their differences on conventional weapons and strategic defense 
the allbutcertain gop nominee said dukakis increased emphasis 
on conventional forces and calls for cuts in nuclear systems 
indicates a troubling conclusion about winnability for a 
conventional force war in europe 
the issue is a very serious debate that has not been joined 
will be joined by me bush told reporters en route to 
columbus ohio for a campaign appearance obviously he dukakis 
will have to join it i think i will come out well on that 
bush in a speech to the fraternal order of police accused 
congress of inaction in the war on drugs and cited the 72 million 
cut in the reagan administrations coast guard budget request 
congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issues of drugs 
but when it comes to law enforcement some of them go awol bush 
said at the organizations national board meeting in ohio 
democratic sen dennis deconcini of arizona addressing the 
group as a surrogate for dukakis disputed bushs claims noting 
that the administrations 1988 budget sought a 900 million cut in 
antidrug funding including money for coast guard and border 
patrol interdiction efforts it also included a 60 percent cut in 
drug prevention and education programs 
deconcini said congress restored 70 percent of the funds and 
said bushs claim is just a bogus argument 
dukakis has criticized the reagan administration for permitting 
coast guard budget cuts saying how can we possibly be serious 
about fighting a war on drugs when were cutting coast guard 
patrols by 55 percent its that kind of thing one of the reasons 
im running for the presidency 
the massachusetts governor is vacationing in nantucket this 
weekend staying at the home of friends the likely democratic 
nominee received promising news from his party platform delegates 
in denver where a blueprint plan was worked out 
dukakis backers easily turned aside jackson efforts to add 
planks that would have committed the democrats to raise taxes on 
the wealthy freeze the pentagon budget double education spending 
commit the united states to no first use of nuclear weapons and to 
a call for palestinian selfdetermination 
the committees handled without rancor a number of amendments 
rejecting some key jackson stands but accepting others including 
ones calling for third world debt relief and significant increases 
in child care aid for lowand middleincome families 
although we have differences about 95 percent of all the 
issues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolved 
in a peaceful and in a unified way and i know that scares the 
republicans to death said former gary ind mayor richard 
hatcher who introduced a jackson budget amendment that failed 
mike barnes the former maryland congressman who led dukakis 
platform team said that in working on the past four party 
platforms i have never seen a situation that was anywhere near 
this unified 
in nantucket dukakis press secretary mark gearan said the 
massachusetts governor spoke with his senior aide jack corrigan 
before departing for his fourday vacation on friday and did not 
receive a briefing after the vote by the democratic partys 
platform committee 
while the action was taken amid signals of party unity and 
displayed dukakis strength in controlling the platform issue 
gearan made no claim that the democratic national convention in 
atlanta next month would be free of floor battles over the platform 
we have a good working relationship with jacksons campaign 
and things are going well gearan said 
but he added i think hes said all along there could very 
well be some floor fights at the convention 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons platform chief said no 
decisions had been made on which if any of the issues jackson would 
fight for on the floor of next months convention in atlanta 
however she said that the two democrats in these proceedings 
moved closer together 
jackson campaigning in st croix said he doesnt want a 
convention of floor fights but indicated that he wasnt satisfied 
with the weekend work of the platform committee 
there will no doubt be some minority positions taken to the 
floor he told reporters i do not think bland is beautiful 
people ought to be specific ought to make promises ought to keep 
promises ought to be make commitments people have given a 
mandate 
the moderate platform which will not be final until approved by 
the convention in atlanta on july 19 is expected to run about 
4000 words the shortest since the terse platforms that franklin 
d roosevelt ran on in 1932 and 1936 
in iowa meanwhile dukakis picked up 10 delegates at the state 
convention and party spokesman phil roeder said nine uncommitted 
delegates will back the massachusetts governor giving him a 4912 
advantage over jackson at the gop state convention bush gained 
all 37 delegates 
the two presidential contenders both finished third in iowas 
initial contest five months ago

brother fought brother and the north won 
again sunday as more than 8000 uniformed men reenacted the final 
charge of the battle of gettysburg to commemorate its 125th 
anniversary 
griff king of the 2nd virginia regiment planned to participate 
in picketts charge against a line of union troops where his 
brother would defend a ridge with the 93rd pennsylvania regiment 
we dont agree on anything anyway said king a 35yearold 
machine operator from weston wva 
about 12500 mock soldiers and civilians in period garb took 
part in the threeday reenactment billed as the largest ever 
organizers said 
some 140000 people witnessed the event over three days 
according to organizers with napoleonic tactics inc which staged 
the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the actual 
battlefield 
following a series of cannon blasts by both sides a 200yard 
line of confederate troops gave a rebel yell and marched 
shouldertoshoulder up to a wall defended by union troops 
troops for the north and south traded volley after volley in an 
engagement staged at onethird its original scale 
it was a great battle said john mcqueen a 37yearold 
marketing manager from atlanta who repeatedly fired for the 52nd 
ohio regiment as soldiers for both sides fell around him 
the rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldnt touch 
them he said 
confederate troops fell back after an hour of fighting in the 
reenactment 
the event ended with soldiers standing in silence for an 
invocation to those who died in the actual battle a bugler played 
taps while 75 cannons fired one after another 
as more than 60000 people massed along a hillside sunday to 
witness the mock charge a woman stood in 19thcentury black 
mourning dress to remind them of the consequences of war 
mourning is appropriate for battle because men die women 
had to carry on said lanie alligood whose beau died during 
fighting saturday 
ms alligood 34 of atlanta said she traveled with a group of 
about 15 women from georgia most of whom dressed in black 
the battle of gettysburg occurred july 13 1863 some 50000 
union and confederate troops were killed or wounded over the course 
of the battle 
major gen george e picketts unsuccessful charge with more 
than 12000 troops against 9000 union soldiers was the 
confederates final offensive push of the battle of gettysburg 
if the battle of gettysburg was the turning point of the civil 
war then picketts charge was the turning point of the battle of 
gettysburg said kim holien a historian with the us army 
center of military history 
king said he decided to join the confederate army because he 
believes in states rights over the encroachment by the federal 
government a battle he said continues 
the battlefield is the courtroom now said king as he 
packed up his tent before the final charge

the gender gap giving democrat michael 
dukakis an early lead over republican george bush might disappear 
on election day said former presidential candidate shirley 
chisholm who warned that factors dividing female voters should not 
be underestimated 
even though most women prefer dukakis the likely democratic 
nominee it doesnt mean they will vote for him in november 
chisholm told about 1000 delegates to the national organization 
for women conference in buffalo 
were not as monolithic as led to believe she said noting 
regional economic and age difference among women voters 
you constantly talk about being 53 percent of the vote but if 
you are unable to deliver that you will be ignored said the 
former brooklyn congresswoman who ran for president in 1972 
chisholm said there was similar talk of a gender gap in 1984 
when the republican ticket of ronald reagan and george bush handed 
the democratic ticket of walter mondale and geraldine ferrao a 
disastrous defeat 
many women particulary southern women couldnt identify with 
ferraro she said weve got ask why and learn from our 
mistakes 
part of the problem she said is that feminists are often 
intolerant of opposing views 
for the last decade she said womens right groups have judged 
candidates mainly on their abortion postions women candidate who 
are not prochoice are often opposed she said 
you cant use one issue as a litmus test she said you 
cant be that emotional about politics 
she said democratic women should recognize that the party will 
need to have a southerner or someone acceptable to southerners on 
the ticket if it expects to win in november 
you had better be prepared to accomodate the more conservative 
views of southern women if you expect to maintain national 
political power she said you cant afford to alienate them 
chisholm campaigned for jesse jackson this year

a teenager beat his mother to death 
the morning he was to graduate as valedictorian of his class 
apparently because she was being overbearingly protective police 
said sunday 
he claimed his mother wouldnt give him any freedom 
detective lt richard clute said 
william shrubsall 17 was in jail without bond sunday after 
police said he confessed to using a baseball bat to crush the skull 
of his 56yearold mother marianne during an argument about 3 
am saturday the boy said his mother hit him first clute said 
shrubsall who is scheduled to be arraigned monday was charged 
with murder just 10 hours before he was to graduate with honors 
from lasalle high school 
the graduation ceremony was held as scheduled saturday but with 
no valedictory speech and no mention of the killing said principal 
ralph guerrucci 
guerrucci said school officials did not want to remind the class 
of 250 students of the tragedy but it definitely dampened the 
day 
the graduates were understandaly upset obviously they 
dont want the day to be remembered by what happened to their 
valedictorian the principal said 
friends and neighbors reacted with disbelief that the crime 
could have been committed by the handsome and popular teenager 
who hoped to become a lawyer and was to attend the highly selective 
university of chicago in the fall 
you cant say anything bad about him he was just 
supernice said darlene irish a neighbor whose father had called 
police and his mom was one of those can i do anything for 
you persons she was always helping 
a classmate larry lang said hed never seen shrubsall get 
angry another classmate terry adamec said he couldnt believe 
shrubsall committed the crime 
he had everything going for him adamec said a class 
valedictorian wouldnt do something like that he was the smartest 
guy in the whole school 
shrubsalls attorney paul cleary said the boy and his mother 
outwardly seemed to enjoy a good relationship but had a history of 
problems that led up to the killing 
he made a detailed statement of that to police and it will 
come out in court cleary said 
the buffalo news reported that mrs shrubsall had physically 
beaten the boy on previous occasions the newspaper quoted an 
unidentified source as saying that despite the boys success in 
school his mother pressured him to do more 
the newspaper report did not offer any evidence of beatings or 
discuss when or how often they may have occurred 
clute said the slaying occurred during an argument over 
shrubsalls returning late from his girlfriends house two blocks 
away 
mrs shrubsall had called the girls home demanding that her son 
return and when he arrived she was waiting for him in the 
driveway police said 
an argument continued inside with mrs shrubsall threatening to 
call the girls parents when she picked up the telephone the boy 
tried to stop her and she struck him in the face with the receiver 
police said 
police said the two had lived alone in their wellkept suburban 
home since shrubsalls father william sr died in 1985

clubwielding police brutally dispersed thousands 
of crimean tatars who massed sunday to protest the kremlins 
refusal to give them back their homeland a protester said sunday 
server tuvarchy who took part in the demonstration in the 
uzbekistan capital of tashkent said 5000 people gathered on the 
citys revolution square in front of communist party headquarters 
the militia beat people tuvarchy a crimean tatar activist 
said in a telephone interview i myself took a girl to the 
hospital who had been beaten so badly she was unconscious 
tuvarchy said at least two people had been arrested he said at 
tashkents southern railway station up to 300 tatars had been held 
by police to prevent them from taking part in the protest 
in moscow dissident valery senderov quoted telephone reports 
from tashkent as saying up to 20000 people took part in the 
demonstration in front of communist party headquarters 
the demonstration was roughly broken up by militiamen who 
kicked the participants and beat them with clubs senderov said 
in a telephone interview he said reports telephoned from the scene 
said hundreds may have been injured 
the demonstration in tashkent about 1600 miles southeast of 
moscow was called to protest a government decision this month that 
denied the crimean tatars their own homeland senderov said 
on june 9 a government commission led by president andrei a 
gromyko ruled that there were no grounds for establishing a 
crimean autonomy 
that announcement was a major setback for the tatars who for 
decades have been demanding a return to their ancestral homeland on 
the black sea dictator josef v stalin deported the tatars from 
the crimea during world war ii for allegedly collaborating with the 
nazis 
the crimean tatars who today number from 250000 to 300000 
were absolved of the war collaboration charge in 1967 but were 
still not allowed to return en masse to the crimea 
a statement issued by the government commission said the soviet 
union had eased restrictions that barred some tatars from returning 
to the crimea 
since the middle of 1987 some 2500 crimean tatars have been 
granted residence permits and fixed up with jobs in the crimea 
the commission said 
crimean tatar leaders have said those measures are inadequate 
and they have demanded the revival of the crimean tatar autonomous 
region abolished by stalin 
senderov said the demonstrators in tashkent were also protesting 
the treatment of crimean tatars in moscow authorities in the 
soviet capital bent on preventing tatar demonstrations during the 
nationwide communist party conference that begins tuesday are 
immediately sending crimean tatars who arrive in moscow back home 
senderov said 
one activist drew a 10day jail term for arguing with a moscow 
police officer he said 
senderov said the protesters in tashkent managed to deliver a 
petition listing their grievances to someone at uzbekistans 
communist party headquarters before the protest was broken up 
the government commission on the crimean tatars was established 
last summer after members of the ethnic group held an 
extraordinary overnight demonstration at red square to press their 
demands

a group that helped defeat a referendum to finance 
a rail and subway system in dallas and its suburbs recommended 
sunday that a streamlined transit authority find other ways to ease 
traffic congestion 
some 59 percent of the voters in dallas and 15 suburbs the area 
served by dallas area rapid transit rejected a proposal saturday 
to sell 1 billion in bonds to begin construction of a 93mile 
commuter rail system 
the outcome was a victory for a group called sensible metro area 
rapid transit which waged a smallbudget campaign against the bond 
proposal 
i think dart is at a crossroads former dallas county judge 
david fox a leader of the citizens group said sunday the 
election is now behind us we now have the opportunity to reassess 
where we are what weve learned and decide how to proceed from 
here 
saturdays results represented a turnabout from 1982 when 58 
percent of the voters approved the measure that established dart a 
regional agency that was to develop a mass transit plan including 
a regional rail system 
the decision throws the transit agencys future into question 
because suburbs may call an election to withdraw from the agency 
dallas suburbs contribute about 45 percent of its financing 
the agency had no official contingency plan in the event of a 
defeat and will return to the drawing board said charles 
anderson its executive director 
some transit authority board members see the bond vote as a 
mandate to develop a new transportation plan 
virtually all of dallas major freeways are at least 20 years 
old and most are burdened with traffic that meets or exceeds 
capacity 
members of citizens group say the areas traffic problems can 
be solved by systems other than rail many of the recommendations 
the group made sunday included restructuring and streamlining the 
transit authority which critics say has become a bloated 
bureaucracy 
the group also recommended that the transit agency develop a 
regional mobility plan that does not require incurring longterm 
debt 
bill ceverha president of the citizens group said such a plan 
could include some rail but added the election shows that the 
economics of mass transit are so fundamentally different today than 
they were a generation ago that they the voters regard fixed rail 
and subway solutions as folly

pope john paul ii on sunday condemned 
the nazi killings of thousands of severely handicapped people as 
the worst forms of barbarism and warned of mankinds potential 
for violence and destruction 
human life should not be divided into that which is worth 
living and that which is not john paul told 1000 elderly sick 
and handicapped people in salzburgs cathedral 
in the german third reich the nazis killed thousands of the 
handicapped under what they called euthanasia programs or mercy 
killings 
decades ago this division led to the worst forms of 
barbarism said the pontiff on the fourth day of his fiveday 
visit to austria 
the 50th anniversary of austrias annexation by nazi germany has 
prompted widespread soulsearching in this alpine nation jewish 
leaders have called on him to urge austrians to come to terms with 
the countrys naziera past 
the pontiff often has called for greater respect for the 
handicapped and for elderly people who are sick the vatican is 
vehemently opposed to mercy killing saying it goes against 
christs teachings 
after the prayer service the pontiff donned a green robe and 
warned of drug abuse in an outdoor mass before 25000 people in 
salzburgs residence square 
in his homily john paul cited the fear of mans dangerous 
potential for violence and destruction and urged parents to 
help your adolescent sons and daughters to withstand the 
temptations of escaping into the sham world of drugs 
also sunday in a gesture of reconciliation the pontiff took 
part in an ecumenical prayer service in a lutheran church with 
representatives of 12 other christian churches and denominations in 
austria 
papal trip organizers said the service was one of the first in 
which the pontiff has participated in a protestant church 
the pope said many catholics and protestants shared suffering in 
world war ii and experienced their deep union in christs cross 
especially in the extremely difficult ordeal of the concentration 
camps he said 
in an afternoon talk to about 150 young people in salzburgs 
catholic youth center the pontiff again referred to the 19331945 
nazi era 
nobody can undo what has already been done the pope said 
even the best psychologists cannot free us from the burden of our 
past only the omnipotence of god can do this 
many austrians actively supported adolf hitler after the 1938 
annexation although the nazis targeted jews leftist politicians 
and other foes for immediate arrest and persecution 
the pontiff told the youths that god cleanses even the 
contaminated soil of our souls with the mercy of forgiveness and 
thus gives us the strength for honest reconciliation with the 
people we have hurt 
he also told them that if past failures are simply swept under 
the rug they will poison our spiritual environment 
on saturday he called the suffering of jewish and christian 
victims of the nazis a gift to the world 
four american jews said sunday that they were beaten by austrian 
police when they demonstrated against the popes meetings with 
austrian president kurt waldheim 
the four made the charge during a news conference at israels 
ben gurion airport and also said they encountered antisemitism 
from austrian people 
rabbi avi weiss of the riverdale synagogue in new york said he 
and three students were beaten by police after they displayed a 
large photograph of waldheim in a nazi uniform at mauthausen a 
former concentration camp that the pope visited 
waldheim has denied allegations by jewish groups that he 
participated in war crimes while serving with the german army in 
the balkans during world war ii 
in vienna the kurier daily newspaper reported that austrian 
television canceled an evening broadcast of the film version of a 
story the pontiff wrote in 1960 when he was bishop of krakow 
poland 
the newspaper said that rai italian radio and television 
requested the cancellation so that the new film can first be shown 
to the pope at a private screening in july 
austrian television will show the film version of the popes 
work called the goldsmiths shop this fall kurier said 
the pontiff retired for the night in salzburg he was scheduled 
to return to rome from innsbruck monday evening

pope john paul ii plans to announce an overhaul of 
the vatican government aimed at streamlining the organization 
italian newspapers reported sunday 
the reorganization is to be announced tuesday the day the 
pontiff is scheduled to formally install 25 cardinals 
the reforms will increase the roman catholic churchs control 
over the vatican bank give the secretariat of state more power and 
establish a commission for relations between the vatican and its 
lay employees the newspapers said 
the church hierarchy has been discussing the reform of the 
vatican government known as the curia for several years 
the milanbased newspaper corriere della sera reported the plan 
would give the college of cardinals responsibility for supervising 
the vatican bank officially called the institute for religious 
works which has traditionally answered only to the pope 
the bank has been the subject of controversy since italian 
authorities issued arrest warrants in february 1987 for its 
president american archbishop paul marcinkus and two of its lay 
employees in connection with italys largest banking scandal 
prosecutors accused the men of being accessories to the 
fraudulent bankruptcy of the banco ambrosiano in 1982 
italys constitutional court ruled earlier in july that italian 
courts could not prosecute the three because the vatican was 
considered a sovereign state under treaties between italy and the 
vatican 
according to the newspaper reports the reform will trim the 
influence of the vaticans foreign ministry the council for 
the public affairs of the church making it just another 
department of the secretariat of state 
the council has functioned as part of the secretariat but has 
enjoyed a high profile and a certain amount of autonomy 
the last major reform of the curia was announced in 1967 by pope 
paul vi it provided that modern languages could be used in 
official documents made diocesan bishops members of all vatican 
government departments and implemented changes brought about by the 
second vatican council which ran from 196265

a partly deaf boy found wandering in 
mexico last year was fitted with a hearing aid saturday and taken 
to an airport in the hope he would recognize an aircraft that would 
help lead to his identity 
the boy nicknamed sabath frequently tugged at the device 
tucked behind his left ear and was distracted by the noise of 
takeoffs and landings 
officials at the juarez center for the development of the 
integrated family named the unidentified boy sabath because he was 
found on a saturday sabado in spanish news reports have spelled 
the boys name as sabat but leticia cota of the family agency said 
the name is spelled sabath 
a hearing test two weeks ago determined the frecklefaced boy 
was deaf in the right ear and had about 20 percent hearing in the 
left the 760 hearing aid was donated by an el paso audiologist 
sabath communicates mostly through gestures and drawings some 
of his pictures seem to indicate he survived a plane crash that 
killed his parents and sister 
for that reason sabath was taken to el paso international 
airport after he was fitted with the hearing aid saturday morning 
officials hoped he would recognize the type of plane he may have 
crashed in but the boy paid little attention to the aircraft 
it was not as successful as i anticipated said luis torre 
a caseworker with the texas department of human services who 
accompanied the boy 
sabath was found wandering near downtown juarez nov 7 1987 
because sabath does not speak write or use sign language us and 
mexican officials have been unable to determine where he is from 
the fbi was called into the case when mexican officials noticed 
sabath prefers american food and cartoon characters to their 
mexican counterparts leading them to believe sabath could be 
american 
officials trying to identify sabath have chased leads in 
illinois oklahoma and france 
the newest lead comes from tampico mexico where a woman says 
her son disappeared about seven months ago she described her son 
as deaf about 8 years old with brown hair freckles and light 
skin a good description of sabath officials are waiting for the 
woman to send pictures of her son said fbi spokesman terry kincaid

british airways suspended service on its two a320 
aircraft as of midnight sunday hours after a new air france plane 
of the same type crashed during an air show and killed at least 
three people 
the narrowbodied shorttomediumrange a320 jet entered 
commercial service in april and british airways took possession of 
its second this month air france took delivery thursday of the 
plane that crashed sunday 
british airways announced it was suspending both its a320s from 
routes between londons gatwick airport and various european 
destinations starting at midnight 
following discussions with airbus and the civil aviation 
authority we have decided to suspend the a320 services as a 
precautionary measure pending further information on the cause of 
todays accident an airline spokeswoman said 
she said alternative planes had been arranged and she did not 
anticipate any cancellations of flights she was not identified in 
keeping with british practice 
the airbus a320 received its certification feb 26 
the a320 was conceived and certified for flight by a twomember 
crew eliminating the navigator 
early this year pilots and flight engineers of air inter the 
largest french airline called a series of strikes to protest the 
use of only two cockpit members in a320s saying it was unsafe 
according to witnesses the air france plane taking part in a 
show in eastern france near the swiss border made a low pass over 
the small habsheim airfield clipped some trees at the end of the 
runway and plunged into a forest 
a london spokesman for the manufacturer the fournation airbus 
industrie consortium in which britain has a large stake refused 
comment on the possible effects for the consortium saying only 
investigators are looking into the incident along with the french 
civil aviation authority there will be a full investigation 
david learmount air transport editor of the respected journal 
flight international said the a320 had been the most successful 
aircraft ever in terms of winning record orders before it was even 
in service 
furthermore he said the circumstances of a display flight and 
an ordinary commercial passenger flight were quite different 
display flights during a show are designed to show the people 
on the ground and on board the maximum use that that aircraft could 
provide he said i dont predict that the aviation world is 
going to react violently to this 
however i am not saying that this is a situation to be 
dismissed it needs a lot of very very careful looking into 
learmount said 
the a320 is the first aircraft equipped with electronic flight 
system and controls that are beside the pilot instead of in front 
of the pilot the jet consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar 
two or three engine jets it is designed to replace

the american heart association approved a 
system sunday to identify and endorse processed foods that meet the 
groups dietary guidelines 
the association said it will look mainly at the salt 
cholesterol and fat levels in food products in deciding whether to 
endorse them as hearthealthy items bearing the groups seal 
of approval are expected to reach shelves within a year 
we regard this new initiative as a logical expansion of the 
american heart associations wellestablished role as the publics 
chief advocate and efforts to reduce premature death and 
disability from heart disease and stroke said dr ww aston of 
dallas chairman of the aha task force that studied the product 
approval idea for the past two years 
the first group of foods that will be examined by an independent 
testing group will be margarines cooking oils and salad dressings 
the association does not expect to endorse meats fruits and other 
nonprocessed food items 
the recommendation was made at the annual delegate assembly in 
st louis which began friday and ended sunday there were about 
140 affiliates and scientific counsels represented at the delegate 
assembly the delegates are the policymaking group for the aha 
heart and blood vessel diseases are the nations leading 
killers and took nearly 1 million lives in the united states in 
1985 the most recent year for which statistics are complete the 
aha said nearly 65 million americans have one or more forms of the 
diseases 
members of the task force said sunday that dietary control is 
one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular 
disease since 1961 the aha has been recommending a diet low in 
fat salt and cholesterol as a way to help reduce heart disease 
many americans have adopted healthier eating habits and 
dietary improvements recommended by the aha clearly have played a 
part in the welcome decline in heart attack and stroke death rates 
that we have seen in the last two decades aston said 
he added that two independent nationwide surveys of consumers 
and health specialists showed that they responded favorably to the 
ahas efforts and wanted more specific information about fat and 
cholesterol levels 
the program will include creation of a consumer health 
information program it will establish a tollfree national 
nutritional telephone hotline that will be staffed by registered 
dietitians who will give information about nutrition and risk 
factors for heart disease to the public and health professionals 
the program also will include media campaigns and a brochure 
listing products that receive the aha stamp of approval the 
brochures will describe the program and provide other facts about 
risk factors with an emphasis on the dangers of cigarette smoking 
and high blood pressure

nurses are squaring off with the nations largest 
group of doctors for a battle this week over a physicians proposal 
to offset the nursing shortage by creating a new class of bedside 
hospital worker 
doctors attending the american medical associations annual 
policymaking convention which opened sunday will debate a plan to 
establish a new type of lessertrained hospital worker to provide 
some care to patients at bedside 
ama officials believe their plan for registered care 
technologists who would handle such chores as changing bandages 
and taking vital signs would be an innovative step toward easing 
the nations nursing shortage 
but the proposal has drawn harsh criticism from the american 
nurses association which contends the best answer to the shortage 
is to improve working conditions and pay nurses better salaries 
its an impractical poorly thoughtout proposal said mary 
foley a nurse from san francisco and an elected cabinet member for 
the nurses association it could be potentially very dangerous 
she said nurses often help diagnose problems with patients and 
act as a backstop to doctors the technogists wouldnt have the 
expertise to spot medical complications or other problems in a 
patient she said 
lillian joel president of the kansas city mobased 
association representing 188000 nurses plans to testify against 
the proposal during a hearing monday at the ama convention the 
illinois nurses association also has organized a protest rally 
monday morning 
dr william hotchkiss ama president disputed the nurses 
concerns and contended the bedside technologists would give nurses 
more time to perform vital highly technical patientcare 
management tasks 
it is in addition to nurses hotchkiss said we are not 
threatening the nurses in any way we want all the nurses we can 
get 
dr joseph painter an internist from houston said the amas 
board of trustees devised the proposal because the nations 
shortage of nurses is projected to hit 300000 by 1992 
were dealing with a major shortage that doesnt look like it 
will improve painter said we dont see this as a turf problem 
between medicine and nursing our view is the person who is 
really suffering from this acute shortage of bedside care is the 
patient 
the ama wants to test its idea on an experimental basis in 
states that now have the worst shortage of nurses he said 
the boards proposal would create three levels of registered 
care technologists the first an assistant technologist would 
be a high school graduate who could begin working with patients 
after two months training 
the worker could become a full licensed technologist with an 
additional seven months onthejob training with nine months of 
more specialized training the worker would become an advanced 
technologist who could work in critical care units painter said 
we thought it should be an apprenticetype training program 
he said we wanted to appeal to a different type of applicant who 
might not want to spend two to four years in college but who would 
want to earn while they learn 
but ms foley a nurse at st francis memorial hospital in san 
francisco called the proposal misguided 
we do have a crisis right now because there is a shortage of 
nurses but the solution to that is not to create an alternative 
healthcare giver with lesser skills she said 
the proposal also has drawn criticism from within the ama ranks 
the ohio delegation to the convention introduced a resolution to 
scrap the idea contending it would further dilute the pool of 
available individuals for the nursing profession and would increase 
the cost of medical care by creating a new category of health care 
provider 
sunday was an opening session of the house of delegates whose 
420 members act as a policymaking legislature for the 
295000member ama 
dr william hotchkiss of chesapeake va gave his farewell 
speech as outgoing president of the ama saying members must work 
to counter the attitude among a small number of doctors that the 
profession is no longer worth fighting for and is no longer 
worth pursuing as a career 
james sammons the amas executive vice president told the 
convention in a written report that doctors and scientists must be 
prepared to battle animal rights activists trying to ban the use of 
animals in medical research 
im afraid that unless we undertake a massive effort to 
protect biomedical research these people are going to force 
medical science into a choice between experiments on animals and 
experiments on humans sammons said

residents of a disputed region in the southern 
soviet union voted at a public meeting to end a monthlong general 
strike soviet media reported sunday 
the work stoppage began in the nagornokarabakh region on may 23 
to press demands that the predominantly armenian region part of 
the republic of azerbaijan be annexed to neighboring armenia 
the legislature of azerbaijan refused to cede the region and 
the governments of armenia and nagornokarabakh have asked the 
moscowbased supreme soviet legislature to intervene 
however in moscow a soviet deputy justice minister mikhail 
vyshinsky indicated at a news conference sunday that the region 
could not be transferred to armenian control without the consent of 
azerbaijan 
as long as the decision about the transfer of 
nagornokarabakh is not taken by azerbaijan the constitution 
does not allow a change in borders of the territory of a 
republic vyshinsky was quoted by the official tass news agency 
as saying 
nagornokarabakh residents met in the regions administrative 
center stepanakert on saturday night and voted to end the strike 
the communist party daily pravda and radio moscow reported 
on the whole the participants in the meeting took a 
constructive decision to restore the rhythm of work pravda 
said it said a majority had agreed with the decision 
pravda also said some in the crowd had not agreed with a call 
from the head of the regional communist party z movsesyan that 
they renounce the use of strongarm methods as a means to 
pressure authorities into accepting their demands 
participants also rejected a suggestion that they wait until the 
end of a nationwide communist party conference scheduled to begin 
tuesday to see what actions they should take in line with the 
conferences decisions pravda said 
the newspaper did not elaborate but the decision could mean 
that demonstrations are planned in nagornokarabakh during the 
conference the partys first in 47 years 
delegates at the conference are expected to discuss relations 
between the more than 100 ethnic groups in the soviet union 
although the disagreement over nagornokarabakh is not specifically 
on the agenda 
the dispute has sparked huge demonstrations in armenia and 
unrest in azerbaijan officials say 32 people including 26 
armenians and six azerbaijanis were killed in rioting in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait in late february and early march 
reports also said eight armenians and eight azerbaijanis were 
injured in fights in two armenian villages this month 
the labor daily trud in a sunday report on the effects of the 
strike said the situation in stepanakert was red hot and that 
people were hiding at home rather than going to work 
during the strike factories stood idle transport did not run 
and railway cars carrying foodstuffs remained unloaded trud said 
it said the strike had cost the region about 50 million in losses 
in nonindustrial goods alone 
trud said the strike had been a stab in the back for

a senior cuban official on sunday admitted 
an increased cuban military presence in southern angola but 
defended the move as an appropriate response to what he called a 
brutal south african attack on the area 
but foreign minister rf botha said sunday he has warned the 
cubans that the military buildup could start an explosive 
confrontation 
jorge risquet valdes chairman of the cuban communist partys 
foreign affairs committee spoke at a news conference a day after 
two days of usmediated peace talks on southern africa ended in 
cairo 
the united states south africa cuba and angola participated in 
the talks the third in a series the talks were aimed at resolving 
the civil war in angola where cuba has thousands of troops and 
ending south african rule in southwest africa or namibia 
a senior us state department official told reporters sunday 
the talks had achieved progress in atmosphere and procedure 
but he said political decisions were necessary to bridge gaps 
between the countries involved 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said some 
parties to the talks had hinted at concessions he did not 
elaborate 
he said among new elements in the peace talks were cubanangolan 
agreement for total cuban troop withdrawal from angola and 
sovietamerican contacts to resolve a number of international 
problems including southern africa 
basic political decisions still have to be made and there is 
not much time to make them because of the military situation the 
official said 
valdes blamed an alleged south african attack on angola last 
december with 9000 troops and heavy equipment for cubas military 
buildup in the country 
this brutal escalation launched by south africa was really 
what made it necessary for the angolan government to ask cuba for 
an increase in forces in necessary quantity both men and 
equipment in order to rebut this offensive and to overcome it 
valdes said 
the increase of cuban troops we did not deny it is the 
proportionate and appropriate response to an increase in brutal 
attacks launched by south africa on angola 
interviewed by the british broadcasting corp on his way back to 
johannesburg botha said he told the cubans that with the 
closeness of a large number of military forces to the namibian 
border you only need a spark to set a big fire to explode 
valdes would not discuss how many cuban troops are in angola he 
refused to confirm or deny south african claims that 15000 to 
17000 cubans now are in southern angola and more than 50000 in 
the country as a whole 
he said cuba sent forces to angola in 1975 at the request of 
luandas marxist government 
in the peace talks which started last month in london the 
united states has been trying to set up a formula using a cuban 
withdrawal from angola as a trigger to get south africa to start 
granting namibia independence 
valdes said final agreement would foreshadow a gradual and 
total withdrawal of cubas military contingent 
he gave no details the leading egyptian newspaper alahram said 
the angolancuban delegation had offered a cuban withdrawal program 
to be complete in four years south africa said it should take no 
more than eight months 
a new round of talks is scheduled for next month in cairo

the first stone was laid sunday for a monument in 
moscow to the more than 13000 soviet soldiers who have been killed 
fighting in afghanistan the official tass news agency said 
the monument which includes an eternal flame to the dead will 
be built in friendship park a popular spot in the soviet capitals 
northwest near the moscow river tass said 
it said veterans of the afghan war sang songs at a ceremony for 
the laying of the cornerstone sunday a day celebrated here as 
soviet youth day 
the creation of the memorial was a sign that the soviet union 
may be increasingly coming to grips with the costs of the war it 
did not win 
during much of the 8year soviet involvement in afghanistan 
the staterun media and officials made scant mention of soviet 
soldiers who had been killed many of the war dead were buried with 
no hint on their tombstones of where or why they had died 
the soviets have been more frank about the casualties under 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openess 
the government disclosed on may 25 that 13310 soviet troops had 
been killed and 35478 wounded since the soviet union intervened in 
afghanistan in december 1979 the kremlin began withdrawing its 
troops on may 15 under a unbrokered agreement concluded the 
previous month 
tass said the war monument will be erected to soviet soldiers 
who died while fulfilling their internationalist duty in 
afghanistan according to official soviet thinking the red army 
did not intervene in afghanistan but came to the aid of a marxist 
government beleaguered by a nationwide insurgency 
tass said that for sundays ceremony a lamp was lit at the tomb 
of the unknown soldier near the kremlin that honors world war ii 
dead and brought to the spot in friendship park where the 
cornerstone was laid 
the lamp will be kept by the statesanctioned soviet peace 
committee until the monument is completed tass said 
members of the peace committee and the moscow city organization 
of the military reserve collected donations for the monument and 
for the construction of a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers 
wounded in afghanistan tass said

nearly one out of every six public housing units 
in chicago sits vacant while tens of thousands of applicants wait 
for a place to live a new study shows 
housing authority executive director vincent lane attributed the 
problem in part to street gangs who have taken over some of the 
buildings frightening residents away 
decent people know when these guys are in a building they try 
to get out they move when units become available in that 
building nobody takes them lane said 
in the past year 1550 of the chicago housing authoritys 
40840 units or more than four apartments a day have become 
uninhabitable the chicago tribune reported in sunday editions 
a total of 6218 units are vacant according to the chicago 
suntimes 
at the robert taylor homes on the south side the housing 
authoritys largest public housing project gangs have taken over 
or have a foothold in half of the 56 buildings lane said 
the vacancy rate has risen to 40 percent in some of the 
buildings controlled by gangs compared with 6 percent at two 
robert taylor buildings not dominated by gangs he said 
the problem is critical the more vacancies you have the more 
they proliferate its like a cancer eating away said lane 
cuts in funds labor and equipment are also to blame for the 
problem lane and other officials said 
but others blamed bureaucratic inefficiency former housing 
authority board member patricia crowley contended that many of the 
40000 people on the waiting lists are dead or cant be located 
the authority has cut its work force from 2880 to 1957 in the 
last year because of federal cutbacks the tribune said 
so instead of quickly repairing apartments when tenants move 
out the authority boards up units which are often rundown after 
years of abuse by tenants 
but by boarding up the apartments the authority is telling 
gangs that they can move in and do their number on it lane 
said

divorce lawyer marvin mitchelson on sunday 
described two former clients who claimed he raped them as 
professional extortionists after they described the alleged 
attacks on a television program 
its ridiculous because ive spent my life defending women 
not attacking them after their complaints were filed i went and 
took a lie detector test on both women and it came out 100 percent 
that i had had nothing to do with them mitchelson said 
he commented after the cbs program 60 minutes featured an 
investigation that began after kristen barrettwhitney and patricia 
french made the allegations against the lawyer 
these women are charlatans they can cry on cue he said 
they know it didnt happen and i know it didnt happen theyre 
professional extortionists thats what you run into in this 
business when youre a highprofile figure these people come 
after you 
ms barrettwhitney said she paid mitchelson 25500 to 
represent her in a palimony action only to have him rape her in a 
bathroom the cbs program quoted ms french as saying she was raped 
by mitchelson and another former client as saying he fondled her 
and took a bubble bath in front of her 
ms barrettwhitney and ms french complained to police who 
recorded a conversation between mitchelson and ms barrettwhitney 
in which the attorney said i have no bad feelings against you 
and i wasnt in any way trying to traumatize you the cbs report 
said 
los angeles assistant district attorney dan murphy said there 
certainly are things that mr mitchelson says in that tape which 
make the hair in the back of my neck stand up i say you know 
something somethings cooking here 
but the district attorneys office decided there was not enough 
evidence to prosecute murphy said 
the 60 minutes report said that when mitchelson was told 
about the story he cried and pleaded with us not to air this 
report offering 10 great stories if the program dropped the 
mitchelson piece 
i urged them not to do it because it was untrue but its a 
misrepresentation for 60 minutes correspondent mike wallace to 
say i begged him not to do it mitchelson said from his los 
angeles office 
the lawyer said ms barrettwhitney has 13 aliases and has filed 
seven different lawsuits totalling 300 million against several 
professionals doctors psychiatrists lawyers dentists all 
claiming the same thing 
he said ms barrettwhitney came to him for palimony and later 
several other suits but he refused to take the other lawsuits 
when i refused to take them then she decided to leave me and 
claim that i sexually attacked her mitchelson said 
he said ms french wanted him to sue a minister for a supposed 
sexual attack 
when i found it to be groundless i said i wouldnt do it 
even still she sent me nice letters for months trying to get me to 
take the case months after the fictitious attack on her supposedly 
happened he said

worldwide grain stocks could sink to their lowest 
levels of the decade and lead to possible food shortages if the 
crippling us drought continues for another two weeks according 
to a un organization 
but officials at the un food and agriculture organization say 
favorable weather and crop prospects have created a brighter farm 
picture in most of the rest of the world 
before the us drought took hold the romebased un 
organization already was projecting that world grain production in 
198889 would not match consumption and that stocks would drop 
close to the level the agency considers the minimum necessary to 
safeguard world food security 
now with the us drought the question is how much is us 
production going to be drawn down peter newhouse chief of the 
agencys global information and early warning service said in an 
interview friday 
the organization had projected june that the united states would 
produce 279 million tons of this years targeted 167 billion tons 
of grain worldwide but that was before the worst drought since the 
great depression parched the midwest

it sounds like grand prize in a supermarket sweepstakes free 
cash land and a year of golf and swimming whats more ladies and 
gentlemen everybody can be a winner 
a toogoodtobetrue offer no a gimmick yes 
the promotion is brought to you by the friendly folks of rolfe 
iowa who hope their slick campaign will entice people to move to a 
tiny town itching to get bigger 
rolfe which will provide 1200 a free lot and recreation for 
folks who build and live in a house worth at least 30000 is 
among a growing number of towns in rural america offering 
incentives to lure new residents or industry 
all across the heartland small towns that have lost people 
jobs and schools to the farm crisis are now waging aggressive 
campaigns in their struggle to expand or at least stay alive 
rural communities are fighting for survival said paul 
lasley an iowa state university sociologist its a very 
competitive situation weve got out there 
some towns make pitches in radio or newspaper ads many have 
hired professionals all are humming a tune of promises promises 
promises low business rents free buildings tax breaks cheap 
utilities and in some cases hard cash 
some towns are angling for jobs others want people both are 
important 
its kind of a chicken and egg question do jobs attract 
people or do people attract employers who bring jobs lasley 
said its some of both 
the increasing number of towns offering incentives he added 
reflects the desperate financial situation in rural america 
not all the towns have been ravaged by hard times but many have 
seen neighboring communities wither away they fear unless they 
move fast theyll be next strategies vary 
in chetek wis population 2160 a bank is offering a 5000 
reward this year to anyone who can bring in a new business that 
will employ at least 15 people full time 
were a small town were looking for any small employer 
were not trying to recruit a saturn auto plant said robert 
missling president of the chetek state bank which is offering the 
reward 
in rolfe iowa the incentives include cash oneyear family 
membership to the pool and golf course and 88 percent initial 
financing 
we feel like we have just about everything we need except 
people said bill winkleblack president of the rolfe betterment 
corp one couple has taken advantage of the offer and a house is 
under construction he said 
in osakis minn up to 5000 is offered toward the cost of a 
lot and home for anyone willing to build and stay five years a 
similar offer is available to businesses the program is financed 
with proceeds from the pull tab a local instant lottery 
we dont want to lose what weve got said tom ellis a 
member of the osakis economic development corp its sort of a 
circleyourwagon defense 
one couple recently took advantage of the program and built a 
home in town ellis said officials said since the incentive was 
announced last fall about 25 inquiries had come in from as far 
away as california and florida 
in mexico mo prospective businesses are being tempted with 
offers of free land and cheaper rents the town will also offer 
cash to a company based on the number and skill level of the jobs 
it brings to town as long as the company stays 10 years 
in the last two years five manufacturers that will eventually 
employ up to 630 people have moved to mexico said jerry 
schmutzler city director of economic development another company 
that will provide 200 new jobs will open in july he said and 
plans in the works could bring 300 more jobs to town by 1990 
schmutzler said special offers are important only after a 
company has narrowed down possible locations to a few towns then 
he said its who wants the company the most its whos 
offering the biggest incentives 
scores of other rural towns have similar programs leading some 
experts to question whether they are giving away the store 
they feel like they dont have a chance unless they sell their 
soul said rex campbell a university of missouri sociologist 
they have to offer not just a building but a building with free 
taxes 
competition is so tough he said if you go 10 miles or 
100 miles down the road theres going to be some other community 
thats willing to provide a company with free everything unless 
you offer free everything youll lose them 
the drawback he said is theres only so many marbles to 
spread around theres only so many plants looking for a site 
and that can pit towns against each other 
in some ways its a zerosum game said lasley of iowa 
state one community gains at the expense of another 
but town officials say they carefully analyze the costbenefit 
ratio before offering special deals 
in rolfe for example we need new housing said david 
jochims city administrator it commits people to our community 
we get a payback we get tax dollars and utility dollars 
the town of 700 has lost about 10 percent of its population 
since 1980 officials say and the last new house was built seven 
years ago 
we need to offer jobs and housing to ensure were going to 
be here in the future jochims added iowa federal statistics 
show lost 62000 people from 1980 to 1986 
in recruiting many communities emphasize the norman rockwell 
aspect of smalltown usa such as low taxes good schools 
little crime but often theres one missing piece in the puzzle 
jobs 
and no matter what they offer experts say remotely located 
towns arent likely to attract industry and without work theres 
little reason for people to relocate 
while many say its too early to judge the impact of incentives 
bettendorf iowa offers an example of where they worked too well 
last year bettendorf had to end its offer to pay up to 500 of 
firsttime homebuyers closing costs when it ran out of money said

the foreign ministers of seven leading 
latin american nations stated sunday that the 8 billion in 
outstanding mutual debt among their nations was the main obstacle 
to creating a regional common market 
foreign ministers of the group of eight mexico brazil 
argentina venezuela colombia uruguay and peru issued a 
communique at the end of their weekend meeting saying they agreed 
to work together to find a solution to the problem 
group member panama was absent from the meeting panama was 
suspended from the group at its last meeting in february shortly 
after military leader gen manuel antonio noriega was indicted in 
the united states on drug trafficking charges noriega engineered 
the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle after delvalle tried 
to fire him 
the ministers who also spent much of their time working on an 
agenda for a summit meeting of their presidents later this year 
offered no specifics about that meeting 
latin american leaders have talked of a common market for years 
but earlier attempts at economic integration have failed 
in the 1960s a central american common market and an 11nation 
latin american free trade association were formed but later broke 
apart amid civil wars and squabbling over tariffs 
recently the group of eight has been trying to revive the plan 
spurned on the economic stagnation blamed in part on the regions 
massive foreign debts last year for example argentina brazil 
and uruguay signed accords breaking down trade barriers 
it is necessary to create mechanisms that will allow the 
nations of latin america to develop in the medium and longterm 
said mexican foreign ministry spokesman victor flores olea 
the ministers also agreed that latin american nations should 
take the most concerted position possible in confronting their 
international lenders 
on monday the ministers will meet in mexico city turning their 
attention to the problems of central america and panamas status in 
the group 
they are to meet with president miguel de la madrid and with 
panamas foreign minister jorge ritter

new evidence has come in lately to buttress the 
widely espoused belief that the stock market makes no sense 
on may 17 the government reported a sharp drop in the trade 
deficit and the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 2122 
points 
on june 14 the government reported another sharp drop in the 
trade deficit and the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
2507 points 
at least one large bank ran advertisements noting these 
divergent performances and suggested its certificates of deposit 
as an alternative to stocks for people who wanted investments they 
could understand 
the bank had a point any investor with a strong desire for 
order simplicity and stability is probably better off avoiding any 
strategy that depends on the daytoday fluctuations of the stock 
market 
but to the charge that the market behaves irrationally its 
advocates respectfully plead innocent 
though the reasoning may get convoluted at times they say 
there is almost always a method behind the madness portrayed on the 
ticker tape 
in the case of the recent trade reports said hugh johnson an 
analyst at first albany corp in albany ny the explanation for 
the markets differing responses lay not far below the surface 
in both instances he noted the trade deficit declined 
significantly 
however the decline in the march deficit reported in may 
signaled that the economy may be strengthening and the decline in 
the april deficit reported in june signaled that the economy may 
be weakening 
the march trade deficit improved because exports surged 
suggesting that domestic demand in west germany japan etc was 
strengthening and was placing pressure on us manufacturers to 
meet that demand 
this was viewed by the financial markets as inflationary 
the april trade deficit improved because imports declined 
suggesting that domestic demand in the us was slowing this 
suggested inflation may not be as big a problem as it has been made 
out to be 
the two events when taken together and reviewed along with 
the markets reaction to other recent releases demonstrate how 
important it is to the financial markets that the economy slows 
down from the pace of the prior three quarters 
in other words stock traders reactions to the trade reports 
were simply a new variation on a theme that has become familiar on 
wall street in the 1980s good news is bad news and vice versa 
favorable news for nearterm business activity conjures up 
images of increased inflation rising interest rates and 
credittightening by the federal reserve all of which could serve 
as prelude to a recession 
unfavorable news for nearterm business activity evokes visions 
of reduced inflation falling interest rates and stimulative credit 
policy from the fed all of which could set the stage for renewed 
growth later on 
suppose you have worked your way through all this and you still 
dont buy it 
how could one monthly report on a single aspect of the economy 
send fears of inflation rippling through the market and another 
four weeks later persuade thousands of investors that things were 
not so bad after all 
well one could argue expectations do not really change that 
radically when the market rises or falls 20 points as measured by 
the dow it is actually moving up or down by about 1 percent to 
adjust for the latest information received 
and at the same time one could acknowledge that this 
adjustment process is emotional messy and sometimes outright 
violent 
most devotees of the stock market will readily admit to all 
that just dont try to tell them it is nonsensical
