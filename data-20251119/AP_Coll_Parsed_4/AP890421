the voyager 2 space probe fired 
thrusters and used onboard gyroscopes thursday to make one of the 
last maneuvers needed to propel it toward a close encounter with 
neptune in august nasa said 
this puts the spacecraft on target for neptune said mary 
beth murrill spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
voyager 2 was 267 billion miles from earth and 183 million 
miles from neptune on thursday four months from the end of its 
12year journey to the giant ball of gas which is the solar 
systems eighth planet 
thursdays maneuver aimed the spacecraft toward the point at 
which it will most closely fly by neptune passing just 3013 miles 
from the planets cloud tops at 9 pm pdt on aug 24 nasa said 
in a news release five hours later the spacecraft will fly 
about 24000 miles from neptunes moon triton 
the hardy space probe launched from cape canaveral fla in 
1977 explored jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 
pictures taken by its television cameras as well as those onboard 
its twin voyager 1 probe vastly increased scientists knowledge 
of the giant outer planets 
thursdays changeoftrajectory maneuver started at 1101 am 
pdt and ended at 120 pm while voyager zipped through space at 
42279 mph murrill said 
because voyager 2 is so far away commands radioed to it at the 
speed of light take nearly four hours to reach the probe the 
spacecraft is controlled with radio commands sent through nasas 
deep space network which includes large dishshaped antennas in 
goldstone calif spain and australia 
murrill said that while some thrusters were fired to help 
execute the course change mission controllers also used the 
probes onboard gyroscopes to make the spacecraft roll and turn 
the rollturn served as the first and only rehearsal for a 
similar maneuver that the spacecraft will execute when voyager is 
just four days from its closest approach to neptune nasa said 
that maneuver will allow controllers to maintain radio contact 
with the probe so they can continue to send it crucial commands to 
carry out its exploration of neptune 
the latest maneuver was performed during a week of simulations 
in which the voyager team is rehearsing what they will be doing 
during the neptune encounter murrill said 
after encountering neptune voyager 2 will leave the solar 
system and begin its study of interstellar space

after three stimulating dances the paul taylor 
dance company concluded its thursday night program at the city 
center with the premiere of the delightful lighthearted funny 
minikin fair 
the music sounded like a circus and the dancers in baggy 
leotards with scanty coverups added became amateur circus 
performers they somersaulted in twos the men groaning when 
attempting to lift the women a virtuoso in a bathing cap tumbled 
he made it look like diving 
a faerie king and queen christopher gillis and mary cochran 
replacing the injured kate johnson had a dance which appeared to 
be based on ballets bluebird pas de deux but she slipped out of 
his grasp there is nothing funnier to a dance audience than 
parodies of ballet 
one dancer was in a collapsible green pipe forcing him to crawl 
like an insect three women in petal dresses got chains of flowers 
caught in the petals as they danced a couple inside the same 
garment seemed to be skating a woman juggled three scarves 
minikin fair followed a brief funny dance 3 epitaphs 
from 1956 that one to a recording of ragged early new orleans 
jazz has five people apparently covered in mud they come out of 
the ooze shake their flippers or scratch like monkeys then slouch 
offstage presumably back into the ooze deciding against evolution 
after all 
the evening began with syzygy which presents perpetual 
motion and in which linda kent was fabulous and dust which 
has a leader of the blind going blind in one section 
paul taylor choreographed everything the company will be at the 
city center through may 7

a legal struggle to decide who is 
the wife of the slain heroecologist francisco chico mendes 
could thwart efforts of international filmmakers to make a movie of 
his life 
eunice feitosa de menezes who claims to be mendes first and 
only legal wife has asked a court in acre his home state to 
confirm her marital status so she can contest any film rights 
allotted the recognized widow ilzamar mendes 
mendes 44 a rubber tappers union leader who fought to save the 
amazon from deforestation was killed by the son of a cattle 
rancher dec 22 outside his modest wooden house in xapuri 2666 
miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
mendes had won a united nations award for his struggle against 
amazon ranchers wanting to clear the rain forests for grazing 
hollywood producers seeing dramatic value in a story about a 
confrontation between powerful amazon landowners and humble rubber 
tree tappers have been turning up in brazil to see about shooting 
a movie about mendes regarded by many as the worlds first 
environmental martyr 
gilson pescador a member of the chico mendes foundation said 
offers have come from robert redford representing 20th century 
fox from united artists paramount pictures warner bros inc 
ted turner from atlanta and a number of british and brazilian film 
companies 
for the moment the decision on who will get the authorized film 
rights along with cooperation from mendes brazilian colleagues 
lies with a fourmember panel from the foundation an organization 
made up of ecologists rubber tappers and mendes family members 
but panel members are concerned that a court battle pitting 
eunice menezes against ilzamar mendes could discourage film 
producers and scuttle the project said pescador 
he and other foundation members say menezes and her lawyer are 
backed by the rightwing rural democratic union a powerful group 
of landowners that rubber tappers and local roman catholic leaders 
allege took part in the mendes shooting 
this is an underhanded attempt by the rural union to descredit 
chico and demoralize our movement to save the forest pescador 
said in an interview the rural union fears the movie will make 
chico an even greater hero than he is now 
the rural union denies the accusations 
also at stake is the money the project would bring to the rubber 
tappers estimated at more than 300000 pescador said 
we need economic resources to continue our work he added 
the movement is in a delicate stage after chicos death and our 
opponents know it 
the rural union which spent millions of dollars in a successful 
lobby effort to water down land reform clauses in brazils new 
constitution says it doesnt oppos a chico mendes movie 
if the film shows what really happened with dignity and is 
backed up with official evidence presented in court we would 
welcome such a production roosevelt dos santos president of the 
rural union said by telephone from brasilia the capital 
but mary helena alegretti a member of the mendes foundation 
panel charged that the landowners group had sought out menezes 
and her daughter with other motives 
the rural union is trying to show the world that chico wasnt 
such a good innocent boy after all she said 
all i know is that i was married to chico ilzamar mendes 
told the associated press maintaining that she married him in acre 
in 1983 
but menezes lawyer norival valadao who has defended rural 
union cattle ranchers in numerous cases against squatters 
ecologists and the rubber tappers said mendes never divorced 
menezes thus invalidating his marriage to ilzamar 
valadao said he had the certificate from mendes church wedding 
to menezes the baptism certificate of his first child by menezes 
and the index of a town hall register documenting the marriage 
the page listing mendes wedding was torn out he said 
but i still have enough evidence to serve justice and annul his 
second marriage 
pescador said there is not one document proving that this 
woman was married to chico but he conceded that menezes was the 
mother of mendes 20yearold daughter angela maria 
alegretti said angela maria would be considered a mendes family 
member when it came time to divide the familys share of film 
rights 
ilzamar mendes her two children and mendes brother and sisters 
would receive 15 percent of the royalties another 15 percent would 
be donated to the rubber tappers union and other such organizations 
in acre the remainder would go to education and health projects 
for indians and rubber tappers throughout the amazon alegretti 
said 
no one here is trying to get rich on these projects she 
said were doing it to get chicos message out thats what he 
would have wanted

a beloved leader dies thousands march to 
beijings central square to express grief and anger the 
government afraid suppresses them 
the scenario played out 13 years ago in what became known as 
the tiananmen incident is being repeated with haunting 
similarities as students mourn former communist party chief hu 
yaobang and demand political reforms 
there are also striking differences reflecting changes that 
have made china a more open and slightly more tolerant society 
in april 1976 the mourning was for premier chou enlai 
regarded by many as the last voice of reason and moderation in an 
age of political insanity known as the cultural revolution 
chou died of cancer in january 1976 revolutionary leader mao 
tsetung was on his deathbed power was in the hands of the 
ultraleftist faction headed by maos wife jiang qing which came 
to be called the gang of four 
the leftists attempted to stifle mourning for chou but during 
the april qingming festival the traditional time for chinese to 
honor their dead there was a spontaneous outpouring of grief 
on april 2 about 10000 people marched to tiananmen square to 
lay wreaths in honor of chou compose poems mourning his death and 
make speeches with thinly veiled criticisms of jiang qings group 
the party ordered citizens to stay away from the square the 
response was defiance 
on april 3 more than 100000 congregated there and the 
monument to revolutionary heroes in the center of the plaza was 
piled high with wreaths 
the following night authorities removed all the wreaths and on 
april 5 events turned violent angry crowds overturned a police van 
and burned several cars and a police command post the militia 
attacked beating with staves and dragging people off 
figures vary but some witnesses say 100 were killed and 3000 
to 4000 arrested 
when mao died five months later militaryled opponents of jiang 
qing moved in quickly and overthrew the gang of four 
like chou hu yaobang was known as a man of the people a victim 
of the cultural revolution he helped redress wrongs done during 
that period 
hu also won the sympathy of students after he was ousted as 
party chief in january 1987 for failing to deal harshly with 
prodemocracy student demonstrations 
after he died of a heart attack april 15 thousands trooped to 
tiananmen square to lay wreaths write poems and give speeches 
criticizing the nations leaders 
but hus popularity was limited mainly to intellectuals unlike 
chou who was beloved by all sectors of society and discontent 
with the pace of political reform today in no way compares to the 
hatreds engendered by the cultural revolutions leadership 
although hu is genuinely respected there have not been the 
tears and deep sense of personal loss there was for chou 
i dont think hu was a savior for the country said one 
beijing university student but we needed something to spur 
people into action she said 
many students interviewed also acknowledged that unlike in 1976 
there is no broadbased support for their protests 
chous death brought out factory workers farmers professionals 
and people of all ages 
workers have listened with sympathy to the students but few 
have joined them in demonstrations 
you cant eat democracy said one worker who argued that 
slowing the 36 percent inflation rate not instituting political 
reforms should be the nations main concern 
and although police have kicked and hit a few students they are 
not likely to resort to such largescale beatings as in 1976 the 
government is more conscious of public and international opinion 
and students worried about their futures are unlikely to press too 
far 
participants in the tiananmen incident of 1989 also know that 
unlike their predecessors they are not going to change the world 
weve tried before to demonstrate for free speech and 
failed said one demonstrator this time too the results will 
not be good

alvin glaze fell off the top of a 
180foot tower and lived to tell about it if he could just 
remember 
i dont remember a thing about the fall said glaze head of 
a tower maintenance crew for the state office of forestry the 
doctors say it might be psychological its just as good i dont 
remember 
the 47yearold glaze suffered no broken bones no internal 
injuries 
i got a bunch of deep cuts and bruises and the meats tore 
from my hands from grabbing those wires he said thursday from 
his hospital bed 
glaze was dismantling a microwave tower from the old forestry 
headquarters tuesday when he fell from the top other workers said 
the fall was cushioned because glaze grabbed two different guy 
wires which turned the fall into a wild slide 
all i know is the chances of me thinking about grabbing any 
wires are too great glaze said i try to live by the lord and 
i believe he did it for me 
dale singleton who was 40 feet below glaze said glaze dropped 
10 feet to the first guy wire and slid along it for about 40 feet 
at that point singleton said glaze reached out and grabbed a 
second wire hooked his leg over and rode the wire to the ground 
he said he couldnt believe his boss was alive on the ground 
he sat up looked at his hands and said im all right 
said singleton 
the triangular tower is supported by three sets of wires and 
glaze used the bottom two to break the fall 
glaze said as soon as he gets back to his leesville home im 
going to hug my family and make some of my own coffee i dont like 
this instant coffee at the hospital 
and hell climb again 
ive got a strong will and im the kind of person wholl 
master it again he said

gag bottles of dirty boston harbor water havent 
gone over very well with logan international airport officials who 
have banned the novelties from airport gift shops 
it reflects badly on other concessions at the airport like 
fresh fish said massport spokeswoman teresa mcalpine one 
mans gimmick is another mans economic trauma 
irving and selma kravetz of quincy came up with the idea of 
selling 5ounce bottles of polluted boston harbor water he 
collects the filthy stuff in large vats she helps fill the little 
bottles 
each bottle bears a label that promises the dirty water inside 
is 100 percent proof but not for drinking as an insurance measure 
the bottle caps are sealed with glue they sell for 3 or 4 
but massport which runs the airport couldnt quite swallow the 
idea and since anything sold at the airport needs massports 
approval the bottles were ordered off the shelves last week 
during his failed run for the white house last november gov 
michael dukakis took a beating from thenvice president george bush 
for having the countrys dirtiest harbor 
bushs advertising drowned out dukakis claim that he took the 
lead in addressing centuries of harbor pollution by setting up the 
massachusetts water resources authority in 1984 to clean the harbor 
waters 
luckily for the kravetzes they also bottle cape cod water 
which is cleaner so they simply swapped merchandise mrs kravetz 
said 
i thought they could have at least taken a joke mrs 
kravetz said thursday 
said her husband they have no sense of humor

insect parts rodent hairs and maggots dont 
sound appetizing but when tossed with a salad churned up in 
tomato sauce or baked in bread theyre not bad at all the 
government says 
the food and drug administration says that though vermin and 
their residues are aesthetically unpleasing within prescribed 
limits they are harmless natural and unavoidable in food 
under fda standards for example 35 ounces of tomato sauce can 
have up to 30 fly eggs 11 ounces of wheat flour can have up to 450 
insect fragments and a half pound of canned or frozen spinach can 
have as many as 100 aphids and a pound of cocoa beans can contain 
up to 10 milligrams of rodent feces 
these limits are in the fdas manual of food defect action 
levels 
according to the manual the levels are set because it is not 
possible and never has been possible to grow in open fields 
harvest and process crops that are totally free of natural 
defects 
the alternative using more chemicals to control insects 
rodents and other natural contaminants is not satisfactory 
because of the very real danger of exposing consumers to potential 
hazards from residues of these chemicals the agency says 
in its manual the fda lists a range of products from apple 
butter to nutmeg from popcorn to pizza sauce for each it also 
lists the level of allowed defect including insects maggots 
rodent filth fly eggs mold rot and mammalian excreta 
during harvesting and processing a great deal of this is 
removed but there could be a few pieces of insects or insect 
bodies that get through paris brickey chief of the 
microanalytical branch at the fda said thursday 
but these are not harmful to health he said the main 
objection is aesthetics but most would not notice it in the food 
if it were there because most of it is microscopic also some of 
the foreign matter like the field insects will be washed off by 
consumers before it is eaten he said 
if the fda found a harmful pest or contaminant like the 
salmonella organism the defect levels would not apply and the 
agency would take the food off the market he said 
the agency uses its defect action levels to measure the sanitary 
conditions of food manufacturers and processors he said if 
contaminants are found in excess of the allowed levels the fda can 
take legal action against the manufacturer and remove the product 
from the market 
eating a fly wing may not hurt you but it does indicate how 
carefully the food has been prepared said rodney e leonard 
executive director of the community nutrition institute a 
nonprofit consumer interest group based in washington dc 
leonard said it may be time for the fda to review the standards 
to go back and examine what quality do we expect and do these 
standards reflect that some of these levels may be too high 
theres more sensitivity today about food quality than at any 
time since the 1960s when we last had a major review of food safety 
legislation he said the problem with chilean grapes and alar 
in apples indicates that the public is questioning the basis for a 
lot of these standards

investigators aboard the uss iowa searched for 
clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of 
47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and griefstricken 
families dealt with the loss of their loved ones 
officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst 
disaster to strike a navy ship in more than a decade a blast that 
ripped through the iowas no 2 gun turret during naval exercises 
wednesday in the atlantic north of puerto rico 
although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel thursday their 
task was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swiveling 
gun housing where the explosion occurred eleven men escaped from 
powder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of the 
turret 
we have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired defense 
secretary dick cheney told reporters as he returned to washington 
from a nato meeting in brussels 
the navy imposed a moratorium on firing 16inch guns found on 
the iowa and its three sister battleships the new jersey the 
wisconsin and the missouri pending an investigation of the 
disaster 
adm richard d milligan a former commander of the new jersey 
began the board of inquirys investigation and pentagon spokesman 
fred hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would 
be completed 
as the iowa headed toward its home port in norfolk va the 
flagdraped metal coffins containing the bodies of the 47 seamen 
killed arrived at the dover air force base in delaware site of the 
largest military mortuary navy honor guards carried the coffins 
off a camouflaged c5 galaxy cargo plane 
the bodies had been airlifted by helicopter from the iowa while 
it was anchored offshore from roosevelt roads naval station in 
puerto rico and placed on the cargo plane for the flight home 
across the nation teams of navy officers and chaplains broke 
the news to the sailors next of kin 
its the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer said rear 
adm jimmy pappas the base commander in norfolk its the most 
difficult thing you have to do to tell someone that a loved one 
has been killed 
ernest hanyecz sr of bordentown nj stayed up all night 
trying to get information about his 27yearold son ernest before 
learning thursday that he was among those killed 
as long as they play their war games there will be more 
deaths and innocent people will die said hanyecz whose son 
joined the navy at the age of 17 
the dead included one officer lt jg phillip edward buch 24 
of las cruces nm and 46 enlisted men most victims were single 
and from 18 to 22 years old said navy officials a memorial 
service will be held monday on the norfolk base 
adm jerome johnson the commander of the us 2nd fleet who was 
aboard the iowa said the fire and explosion was instantaneous 
navy officials aboard the iowa had scheduled firing 22 rounds 
four rounds were fired from the no 1 turret and immediately after 
the commander had given the order to load and prepare the gun in 
the no 2 turret the explosion occurred 
capt larry seaquist a former captain of the iowa told 
reporters earlier in the day it seems from the reports that 
those powders exploded six 110pound sacks of powder are rammed 
into each gun after it is loaded with a 1900pound shell 
naval officers familiar with the iowa said an explosion can 
occur if a gun breech is cracked but seaquist stressed we 
simply do not know what caused that powder to go 
none of the four battleships of the iowa class which saw 
service in world war ii and the korean and vietnam wars had 
previously experienced such an explosion pentagon officials said

a prosecutor said ramon salcido was 
deported at his own request thursday rendering moot the debate 
over whether the admitted mass slayer would be forced to leave 
mexico to face trial in california 
salcido accused of killing his wife two young daughters and 
four other people left mexico city aboard the private plane of 
famed cartoonist charles schulz a santa rosa resident who had 
supplied the jet to sonoma county authorities 
salcido landed in san diego and would reboard the plane to 
continue on to sonoma county after clearing customs and immigration 
checks officials said 
us attorney joseph russoniello said he was told salcido had 
asked to be returned to the united states 
apparently he requested voluntary departure russoniello 
told reporters here mexican authorities did nothing to interfere 
with that request he confirmed with them that hes for all intents 
and purposes an american subject 
russoniello said he was aware of no assurances given to salcido 
that he would not face the death penalty some officials had 
speculated that mexico would put up an extradition fight because 
that country has no death penalty 
state attorney general john van de kamp had already begun 
extradition proceedings when salcido was deported 
but peter keane a professor of criminal procedure at hastings 
school of law in san francisco said mexican officials may have 
thought the charges so reprehensible that they had very little 
sympathy for salcido 
the usmexico extradition treaty is a mutualtype agreement 
between the two countries but we have no enforcement power over 
it keane said 
mexican officers reported arresting salcido on wednesday in a 
roadblock set up to snare drug traffickers the winery worker has 
admitted killing seven people in a rampage through sonoma county on 
friday 
the us immigration and naturalization service said salcido had 
not filed naturalization papers and was still a mexican citizen 
but mexican authorities said salcido claimed to be a us citizen

hooded gunmen killed an american 
military officer and vietnam war hero friday as he was driving to 
work at the joint us military advisory group headquarters us 
and filipino officials said 
us embassy spokesman jerry huchel said army col james n 
rowe 51 of mcallen texas was pronounced dead on arrival at a 
philippine military hospital and his body was flown to clark air 
base 50 miles north of manila 
while no group claimed responsibility a senior filipino officer 
said investigators believed the killers were communist rebels 
rowe who was shot in the head was held prisoner by the viet 
cong from 1963 until he escaped in 1968 he wrote a book about the 
ordeal entitled five years to freedom 
friends of rowes in the us diplomatic community said he was 
to have addressed the us embassys womens club on wednesday 
about his experiences in vietnam he is survived by a wife and two 
young children the friends said on condition of anonymity 
col victor tiangco of the philippine militarys capital region 
command said rowe was chief of the army division at the joint us 
military advisory group which provides training and logistical 
support for the filipino army 
he said rowes filipino chauffeur joaquin vinuya was wounded 
in the shooting but was reported out of danger 
tiangco said assailants wearing hoods opened fire with m16 
rifles as rowes car approached the group compound in suburban 
quezon city about 710 am tiangco said 21 bullets struck the car 
police said at least three people were in the assailants car 
at least two of whom were gunmen and one a driver one gunman had 
an m16 and another had a 45 caliber pistol they said 
tiangco said the assailants sped away witnesses said rowes car 
was able to reach the compound about two blocks from the shooting 
col manuel oxales deputy chief of the national capital region 
defense command said communist rebels were suspected because of 
the weapons and style of the attack oxales said rowe was struck in 
the head 
oxales said the preliminary investigation indicated three cars 
may have been used in the attack although most witnesses said they 
saw gunmen firing from only one 
toto austria a cashier at a gasoline station said he heard 
shots and turned to see a white car pull alongside rowes 
silvergray vehicle with tinted windows 
as the cars turned right along a traffic circle austria said he 
saw one m16 rifle extending from the window and firing at the 
other vehicle he said rowes car turned toward the military 
compound and the assailants followed continuing to fire 
the assailants car then made a uturn and sped away 
there was no indication as to who staged the attack or why 
in october 1987 communist rebels killed three americans and a 
filipino of us descent in simultaneous attacks near clark air 
base 
the rebels have threatened more attacks against americans 
because of us support for president corazon aquinos 
counterinsurgency campaign us officials speaking on condition 
of anonymity said any future attacks would probably be directed 
against soldiers assigned to the advisory group 
on april 9 rebels blasted a us military communications in 
benguet province no one was injured but us officials asked that 
security around american installations be tightened 
rowes book published in 1971 details the disease and

the multimillionaire hunt brothers of texas 
came within weeks of cornering the world silver market according 
to a previously secret government document but the hunts say they 
were only following a family tradition of thinking and buying 
big 
filings in the governments pricefixing case against nelson 
bunker and william herbert hunt show that government investigators 
believe they were close to establishing a world silver monopoly in 
1980 
the brothers in their response say the silver shopping spree 
was nothing out of the ordinary for the sons of legendary texas 
oilman hl hunt 
the government and defense documents which had been under court 
seal were obtained by the associated press this week through a 
freedom of information act request 
hl hunt was a wildcatter the brothers lawyers say in 
their response he raised his sons with a wildcatters 
philosophy which involved risktaking and rapid decision making 
when the hunts enter a field of investment they typically do so on 
a relatively large scale in light of their substantial wealth 
the commodity futures trading commission contends that the 
brothers actually were engaged in a pricefixing scheme 
in a previously sealed submission by the cftc to an 
administrative law judge the agency contends that had the scheme 
not collapsed by the end of may 1980 they could have owned 
virtually the entire available world supply of deliverable 999 
silver bullion 
attorneys for the hunts counter that their silver investments 
stemmed simply from their preference for investing in hard assets 
as a hedge against inflation and monetary uncertainty 
and they said such large purchases were in keeping with the 
brothers approach to business 
at the time of the 1987 filing hunt attorneys said bunker 
owned a forest in florida the largest tract of land in northern 
australia a quarter of million square feet of building property in 
downtown anchorage and the biggest piece of waterfront property in 
san diego he was one of the largest cattle raisers in the country 
and owned the largest arab coin collection in the world 
their oil holdings of course are very substantial the 
lawyers said and include interests in many of the richest fields 
discovered to date 
many documents in the case had been sealed from the public view 
since 1985 at the hunts request the stack is now more than 5 feet 
tall the filings in the quasijudicial proceeding were released by 
the agency this week in response to the ap request 
the cftc has accused the brothers heirs to one of the worlds 
greatest fortunes of rigging the price of silver futures between 
fall 1979 and march 27 1980 that day came to be known as silver 
thursday as prices crashed to 10 an ounce from a onetime high 
of more than 50 an ounce 
thousands of investors who had purchased silver on credit lost 
billions of dollars when they were forced to sell it to pay their 
debts the hunts themselves lost an estimated 13 billion 
the prices for silver bullion and futures during that period 
rose to their highest levels of the century and then fell even more 
quickly than they had risen only the hunts silverbuying frenzy 
accounts for the magnitude of the price rise said a cftc 
document 
it is the largest market manipulation case ever filed by the 
cftc and if the hunts lose they could be permanently banned from 
trading in all futures markets and fined 100000 for each 
violation of federal commodity laws 
the brothers response to the charges offers a glimpse into 
jetsetting life on the international horseracing circuit from 
kentucky to france of banking in zurich and of courting arab 
investors 
the cftc says it has evidence of a tangled web of 
relationships and rendezvous at luxurious locales to support 
charges the men schemed to corner the silver market the agency 
alleges the hunts recruited saudi arabian sheiks ali bin mussalam 
and mohammed aboud alamoudi and brazilian speculator naji robert 
nahas to join their effort 
these horserelated meetings amount to zero proof of 
conspiracy or manipulative intent the hunts responded there 
is not a scrap of evidence that these meetings resulted in any 
joint conduct or even parallel transactions with respect to 
silver 
since the 1987 filing the brothers have filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization they face several internal revenue 
service claims totaling many millions of dollars and bunker hunt 
was forced to sell his beloved breeding and racing stock of horses 
because of setbacks in the oil industry 
they and others also have been ordered by a jury in new york to 
pay 1364 million to minpeco sa the peruvian governments 
silver mining company for ruined investments because of the silver 
price collapse

he is perhaps the longest serving chief of 
diplomatic mission in washington but his name has been 
conspicuously absent from state department invitation lists for 
years 
he came here in the summer of 1977 with high hopes for a more 
congenial relationship between his government and the united states 
but is going home in a few days with the atmosphere worse now than 
when he arrived 
for ramon sanchez parodi being fidel castros agent in 
washington has not been an easy task 
much of his tenure has overlapped with the era of conservative 
republican dominance in washington a time when kind words for 
castro have been as rare as frost in havana in july 
but sanchez parodi has acquired a reputation here as a no 
apologies defender of his countrys leader and its revolution 
for starters dont try to convince him about the merits of 
western values he told a gathering at a local university the 
other day that to cuba western values means centuries of 
spanish colonial rule decades of american neocolonial rule and a 
capitalist system that left millions of cubans in misery 
we dont want to have anything to do with these values he 
said his mastery of english reflecting his long stay here 
he believes the strain in relations with the united states has 
damaged american interests cuba could help the united states curb 
drug trafficking and environmental pollution but washington has 
been unwilling to enlist cubas cooperation he said 
the absence of a more normal relationship he said is the 
result of washingtons refusal to accept cuba as a sovereign and 
independent nation 
sanchez parodi assumed his duties here on sept 1 1977 ending 
a 16year period in which diplomatic contact between the united 
states and cuba was a rarity 
when he arrived to open a small cuban diplomatic mission here 
there were champagne toasts the carter administration was young 
and was giving high priority to promoting a more normal 
relationship with cuba 
sanchez parodi thought that full diplomatic relations could be 
restored in two or three years 
but one setback followed another president carters national 
security adviser zbigniew brzezinski was never enthusiastic about 
detente with castro and he worked behind the scenes to head off 
that possibility according to officials familiar with that period 
there were myriad other irritants during the carter years the 
dispatch of cuban troops to ethiopia a flap over a soviet military 
brigade in cuba and the arrival in florida of more than 125000 
cubans including many who were criminals or mentally ill aboard 
the mariel boat lift in 1980 
with the advent of the reagan administration sanchez parodi 
acquired almost pariah status a reflection of the view of 
thensecretary of state alexander m haig jr that cuba was 
responsible for leftist turmoil in central america 
there was a time at the end of 1981 that sanchez parodi feared 
an american invasion of cuba that concern didnt materialize but 
the administration in other ways tried to make life for castro as 
difficult as possible 
it tightened the us embargo against cuba forbade american 
tourists from going there and encouraged allied countries with 
some success to limit their dealings with cuba 
there was the usled invasion of grenada cubas main 
supporter in the caribbean and the introduction of radio marti 
the voa broadcast operation tailored for cuban listeners 
there were us spy flights over cuba and an intensive us 
campaign to call united nations attention to alleged human rights 
violations in cuba for a time the us representative in cuba was 
as much a social outcast in havana as sanchez parodi was in 
washington 
even the arrival of a moderately less ideological administration 
in washington three months ago has not produced a breather in 
relations 
secretary of state james a baker iii saw to that by sending 
diplomatic posts a memo last month asserting that an improvement in 
relations with cuba is not possible until cuba ends its 
unacceptable behavior 
now sanchez parodi is returning to havana having been promoted 
to the post of vice foreign minister once installed there he may 
have a hand in shaping cubas response to washingtons latest 
proposed innovation for the island a television version of radio 
marti

three black nationalist guerrillas were 
killed in a battle with south africancontrolled forces in northern 
namibia in the first fighting reported this week a territorial 
official said friday 
gerhard roux chief aide to namibia administratorgeneral louis 
pienaar gave the death toll for the thursday afternoon battle 
before flying north friday on what he said was a routine trip 
he said he had no more information about the clash 
col richard warren commander of australian un military 
forces in northern namibia said the battle was reported to be 
serious he said it took place three to five miles from okankolo 
which lies about 30 miles southeast of ondangwa airbase where roux 
was headed 
martti ahtisaari the special un representative for namibia 
was informed of the fighting sources said 
the united nations forces in namibia have set up assembly points 
in the north for the guerrillas to report to and be transported 
back across the border to angola 
but according to police and military reports most of the 
guerrillas who have left crossed the border on their own rather 
than report to the assembly points or to church premises which 
also have been declared safe havens 
the incursion by several hundred guerrillas from the southwest 
african peoples organization or swapo across the border from 
angola on april 1 interrupted the implementation of a un peace 
plan intended to lead to independence elections in november 
south africa which has ruled the territory for 74 years had 
agreed to the plan which called for the orderly unarmed return of 
the guerrillas in midmay from their bases in angola and tanzania 
swapo guerrillas have been fighting since 1966 to end south 
african control of the territory which is also called southwest 
africa 
in another development a un official said thursday the united 
nations has completed an investigation into allegations of police 
intimidation at a mission station in northern namibia and has asked 
the south africanappointed administrator of the territory to take 
action 
un official cedric thornberry said the report by the un 
police commissioner steven fanning would not be made public 
residents of the area around oshikuku where some swapo 
guerrillas had assembled for transport to angola had told church 
officials and reporters that police threatened and harassed them in 
an attempt to make them give information about guerrillas in the 
area

new rules for organizing hospital workers 
appear to give unions a better chance of recruiting some of the 
estimated 6 million nonunion workers in one of the fastest growing 
sectors of the economy 
the rules issued thursday by the national labor relations board 
also appear likely to intensify the already heated competition 
between two major unions seeking to establish themselves as the 
leader in the healthcare sector union officials say 
those unions the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees and the service employees international union 
represent about 300000 health care workers each and are competing 
to win the affiliation of the 75000member national union of 
hospital and health care employees whose members decide the issue 
next month 
the nlrb rules published in todays federal register create 
eight categories of hospital employees distinctions that will 
prohibit hospitals from lumping together in prospective bargaining 
units workers with widely varying tasks such as nurses and 
janitors 
unions contend hospitals have used such tactics to stymie 
organizing efforts now if a union can win an election among 
workers in any one category the hospital would have to recognize it 
as the collective bargaining agent for that group 
the hospital industry which has opposed the new rules 
throughout the rulemaking procedure said it planned to challenge 
them in court on grounds they violate 1974 legislation designed to 
prevent undue proliferation of bargaining units within the 
health care industry 
what we see occurring are steppedup efforts to place hospital 
employees in these numerous bargaining units said michael 
anthony executive vice president of the american hospital 
association we see that resulting in a myriad of different 
benefit packages contracts with varying termination dates the 
potential for work stoppages and a number of negotiations that 
might be ongoing at a given time it all adds up to additional 
costs being incurred by the hospitals 
the unions not surprisingly offered different interpretations 
the ruling sends a clear signal to hospitals to accept the 
fact that health care workers want to organize said afscme 
president gerald w mcentee 
we see it as a major victory for health care workers said 
seiu attorney jonathan hiatt these rules should finally provide 
a real opportunity for those health care workers who wish to 
organize to gain a voice 
hiatt said the ruling raised the stakes in next months 
affiliation election because the winner could be viewed as the 
premier healthcare union 
i have no question that there are other unions out there who 
are interested in organizing this industry he said without 
referring to afscme 
afscme is the larger of the unions with 12 million members as 
opposed to seius 850000 
the regulations are little changed from proposed rules issued in 
september the nlrb said it believed its decision to recognize 
eight categories met the congressional mandate 
congress in adopting that provision said that health care 
could be unduly disrupted if hospital management had to deal with 
too many unions such as the dozen or more unions sometimes found 
in construction and other industries 
the rules effectively reverse a 1984 nlrb decision allowing only 
three or four bargaining units at hospitals since that decision 
the number of hospital workers nationwide who belong to unions 
dropped from 23 percent to 19 percent according to union figures 
disputes over the structure of prospective bargaining units led to 
dozens of nlrb and court cases 
the eight categories listed in the final rules are physicians 
registered nurses all professionals except physicians and 
registered nurses technical employees such as lab workers skilled 
maintenance workers business office clerical workers guards and 
all other nonprofessional employees 
the rules apply to acute care hospitals exempt are nursing 
homes psychiatric hospitals rehabilitation hospitals and other 
health care facilities units of five or fewer employees also would 
be exempt from the rules

a senate committee is taking a look at the 
impact of 10 years of airline deregulation on fares and competition 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee sent 
letters thursday to transportation secretary samuel skinner and 
attorney general dick thornburgh raising several questions about 
the decreasing number of airlines and the increasing cost of 
airplane tickets 
in my view economic concentration and monopoly power are at 
the heart of the problem said sen john c danforth of missouri 
ranking republican on the committee the letters were signed by 
danforth committee chairman ernest hollings dsc and sens 
wendell ford dky and john mccain rariz both leaders of the 
aviation subcommittee 
the senators said that while 215 airlines were created over the 
last decade only 59 still exist and eight carriers now control 94 
percent of the us air travel market 
the committee also has asked the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress to analyze the impact of decreased 
competition in its study of fares at 15 large and small hubs around 
the country a congressional source said the committee plans to 
hold a hearing on airline competition next month 
the letters to skinner and thornburgh raise strong concerns 
about performance of the aviation industry since deregulation in 
1978 
the inquiry follows a transportation department study in january 
that showed air fares have increased substantially since 1985 at a 
half dozen airports dominated by a single airline the study showed 
aboveaverage increases at st louis charlotte nc cincinnati 
detroit minneapolis raleigh nc and salt lake city 
the senators asked skinner to say whether he considers the 
concentration consistent with the goals of deregulation whether it 
can be reversed and whether he supports the purchase of interest in 
us airlines by foreign carriers 
they also asked several questions about the apparent link 
between high fares and increasing singleairline domination of hub 
airports about the effects of deregulation on service to smaller 
communities about airline profits and about other matters 
affecting competition 
the senators asked thornburgh if the justice department believes 
action should be taken to encourage more competition particularly 
at hub airports 
questions for thornburgh cover department policy on the 
application of antitrust laws to airlines on international mergers 
involving us airlines on airline control over hub airports on 
longterm leases of gates and other airport facilities on sharing 
arrangements between major airlines and regional carriers and on 
department authority to challenges predatory pricing and 
discriminatory pricing by airlines

through good years and bad years cleveland 
indians baseball fans have always had one thing they could count 
on cleveland stadiums famous bertman ball park mustard until 
now 
the indians cut the mustard from the menu this spring prompting 
dismay from fans who have been defying chilly breezes off lake erie 
to see the home team 
ive been away from this town for 15 years and lived all over 
the us and ive told everybody that the best mustard in the us 
is in cleveland said lee snyder 43 of columbus and now 
they tell me its not the same mustard its like taking the brats 
bratwurst out of milwaukee 
but stomach grumbles apparently outweigh discontent 
laverne schmotzer general manager for service america the 
concessionaire at the stadium say fans this year have been eating 
about 1 hot dogs apiece per game the same as usual 
attending an indians game or cleveland browns football contest 
and munching a hot dog topped with the tangy bertman mustard has 
been a tradition since joe bertman introduced the brown mustard at 
ballgames in 1950 
but when bids came in this february bertmans price was 2 more 
per case than its cleveland competitor authentic stadium mustard 
ms schmotzer said she said she decided to switch to authentic 
stadium mustard after tasters from the indians and browns staffs 
said they couldnt tell the difference between the two mustards 
there has been a feud between the two companies and every 
year they both say they have the best mustard ms schmotzer 
said the taste was so similar we decided to go with a better 
price 
but at least some of the fans attending wednesdays game with 
the boston red sox think tradition is more important than money 
others said you have to pay for good taste 
its a little different but the taste is basically the same 
mike mcgonega 40 of suburban bay village said while eating a hot 
dog what makes everybody mad is that it was based on price they 
broke a tradition without asking anybody normally im not an 
opinionated guy but on this youve got to dig your heels in 
larry hammond 33 of jackson mich said i used to buy this 
stuff by the jar i dont know if i will after tasting this it 
tastes diluted its not as tangy 
pat bertman mazoh joe bertmans daughter took over the mustard 
and food distribution business after her father died she says the 
recent mustard switch at the stadium is just another skirmish in 
mustard wars with david dwoskin president of the davis food 
co which distributes authentic stadium mustard 
in 1968 dwoskin and joe bertman agreed that dwoskin would sell 
bertmans mustard to retailers and the mustard became available in 
jars to shoppers 
bertman and i had a deal where he would continue selling the 
mustard at the stadium we were both buying the same mustard from a 
chicago plant dwoskin said 
up until 1982 we were stadium mustard mrs mazoh said 
then my father dreamed up ball park mustard 
stadium mustard is made in chicago while bertmans is made in 
southern ohio the mustard distributors said 
margaret engel coauthor of food finds americas best local 
foods and the people who produce them said bertmans mustard was 
included in their 1984 book but a new edition of the book may 
include both brands 
no matter which company was selected cleveland is to be 
commended for having two great mustards ms engel said from her 
bethesda md home cleveland has always had mustard 10 levels 
above other stadiums most ballparks have that horrible 
institutional bright yellow tasteless glop

the financial industry was the leader of 19 
categories of special interest groups that paid honoraria to 
senators from 1984 to 1987 a new study says 
and eight of the top 10 senate recipients of the money held 
positions on committees that voted on issues affecting that 
industry according to report released thursday by public citizen 
the financial interests spent 13 million in honoraria during 
198487 followed by the food and beverage industry which spent 
11 million the next group educational institutions paid more 
than 663000 
recipients of honoraria served on committees able to help the 
giver all the top 10 recipients of honoraria from the food 
industry were on committees that voted on food issues 
all together senators received 95 million during the years 
studied and kept 73 million the difference going to charity so 
members could comply with the senate limits on honoraria 
republican senators received an average of 27881 each year 
compared with 22005 for democrats the study said 
other contributors of honoraria were the health 
telecommunications and transportation industries builders and 
developers the energy and insurance industries business advocacy 
groups the defense industry ideological groups law firms 
religious organizations advertising firms the computer and 
chemical industries utility companies and publications that 
bought articles 
public citizen which describes itself as a national consumer 
and environmental advocacy organization founded by ralph nader 
entitled its honoraria report who pays the piper 
honoraria consist of payments for speeches appearances and 
articles senate rules allow senators to keep up to 40 percent of 
their 89500 salary or 35800 in honoraria a year with the 
rest given to charity 
house members can keep honoraria totaling 30 percent of their 
salary or 26850 annually payments to lawmakers in both houses 
cannot exceed 2000 for an individual speech or appearance 
lawmakers appeared willing earlier this year to do away with 
honoraria in return for a pay raise that would at least offset the 
loss this supplemental income was left untouched however when 
the pay raise collapsed under intense public pressure 
the system is now under review by a special committee headed by 
reps vic fazio dcalif and lynn martin rill and no action is 
expected anytime soon 
in unveiling new ethics proposals april 12 president bush made 
no recommendation on congressional honoraria saying he wanted to 
take it up at a future time in connection with a congressional pay

improved prospects for the nations 
agriculture have helped boost the value of farmland but 
agriculture department economists say the heady price levels of the 
early 1980s are as yet but a dream 
the departments economic research service said thursday that as 
of feb 1 the average value of us farmland including buildings 
was 597 per acre up 6 percent from about 564 on feb 1 1988 
it was the second consecutive annual increase farmland prices 
sank to a 19year low of 548 per acre on feb 1 1987 before 
gaining 3 percent last year 
however the 1989 value was still 27 percent below the record 
823 in 1982 the report said 
several factors were cited for the gain in farmland prices net 
cash income of farmers in 1988 nearly matched the 1987 record and 
that buoyed confidence among prospective buyers that the 
agricultural sector was working its way out of the crunch that 
weighed on many farmers 
although producers hit by the 1988 drought experienced lower 
crop yields many grain producers particularly those with 
irrigation and those holding grain stocks from previous harvests 
benefited from sharply higher market prices the report said 
federal drought aid also boosted farm receipts in 1988 and 
helped blunt the shortterm impact higher cattle prices helped 
expand cash receipts from livestock to record levels last year 
the report said 
values rose in all farm production regions except the southern 
plains the report said substantial gains in pennsylvania 
delaware and new jersey led the 13 percent average increase in 
the northeast 
although state average farmland prices were not immediately 
available the report said substantial gains also occurred in the 
corn belt up 10 percent and the northern plains 9 percent 
further significantly higher values were reported in iowa and 
nebraska 
land value increases in the lake states up 5 percent and the 
southeast up 7 percent were said to be comparable to last 
year while a 6 percent increase in appalachia was sharply higher 
than the year before a 3 percent increase in the value of farmland 
in the delta states was the first since 1981 
higher values in the pacific region 5 percent and the 
mountain region 1 percent represented the first increases since 
1984 the report said the 5 percent drop in texas more than 
offset the 9 percent gain in oklahoma leading to an overall 2 
percent decline for the southern plains

the agriculture department says it is making 
progress in writing new federal regulations on making oldfashioned 
country hams a rulemaking procedure that began more than six 
years ago 
but a final decision could take until the end of this year and 
maybe longer if the usdas long history of delays is taken into 
account 
the country ham issue began in march 1983 when the department 
initially proposed new safety rules for commercial processors but 
industry challenges usda tinkering and other hurdles kept pushing 
back the rulemaking deadline which is currently dec 31 1989 
country hams are most commonly found in cloth bags in 
supermarkets and country stores preserved by salt smoke and air 
for months and even years they must be scraped soaked and cooked 
before being eaten 
most hams in supermarket meat counters are wetcured quickly in 
brine solutions and cooked before sale to consumers 
in its latest move announced thursday the usda proposes to 
allow certain amounts of potassium chloride as an alternative to 
salt in the curing of country hams to kill trichinae microscopic 
parasitic worms if improperly cooked and eaten infested meat can 
cause a disease called trichinosis in humans 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said federal regulations currently 
allow three curing methods for destroying trinchinae in ham the 
proposal modifies two of the methods and provides and additional 
method 
crawford said the proposed new method would allow processors to 
substitute potassium chloride for some of the sodium chloride 
salt in the curing mixture current rules call for a 4 percent 
salt content to ensure safety of the ham 
but research by north carolina state university shows that some 
substitution of potassium chloride can be allowed without 
compromising safety he said a minimum salt content in the cure 
mixture would be required but up to half the weight could consist 
of potassium chloride 
the proposal also would eliminate the current method no 2 
for destroying trichinae which involves injecting a salt water 
solution into the ham crawford said his agency believes this 
method is no longer being used commercially 
public comments on the country ham proposal can be sent through 
june 19 to policy office attn linda carey fsis hearing clerk 
room 3171s fsis usda washington dc 20250

president bush is voicing bewilderment over 
claims that sensitive irancontra documents including some 
dealing with his own actions were withheld from congressional 
investigators 
but bush does say emphatically that the reagan white house not 
his was responsible for providing documents to the committees 
during their investigations in 1987 
if the lawmakers now have a complaint about what was and was not 
made available he said they should contact ab culvahouse who 
was reagans white house counsel at the time 
all i can just state is the confidence that i feel in 
culvahouse and company he said thursday 
bush also insisted anew that he would not discuss a document 
showing that he served as an intermediary in getting honduras to 
help the nicaraguan contras this came during a time when us 
military aid to the rebels was banned 
i might have something to say on it after the completion of 
the trial of former reagan white house aide oliver north who is 
accused of lying to congress and obstructing a congressional 
investigation among other charges 
i went to honduras sure thats a matter of public record 
he said during the 22minute questionandanswer session on the 
colonnade next to the rose garden 
put it this way my conscience is clear 
on other matters bush 
said he has not made any decision on new restrictions against 
semiautomatic weapons likewise he said he has not made a decision 
about how to modernize the strategic nuclear arsenal or funding 
levels for the star wars missile defense program 
declared that selective drug testing for federal employees is 
very important and nobody will change my mind on that one but 
he sidestepped questions about whether he agreed with attorney 
general dick thornburghs suggestion in a baltimore sun interview 
that drug testing for public housing applicants ought to be 
considered 
said he wished there was some dramatic plan that could win 
agreement to stop the violence in lebanon the problem the 
shortrun of it how you stop this firing the shelling how you 
get factions to stop warring has certainly in recent times defied 
solution but we cant give up on it 
the session with the small group of reporters was dominated by 
questions about the irancontra documents which have surfaced for 
the first time during norths trial 
bush said he would offer full cooperation to any request made 
of this administration for information however he said 
documents from the reagan white house were in the control and 
custody of the federal archives 
i have no reason to believe that the previous administration 
the lawyers in it who worked closely with congress did not fulfill 
their obligation bush said 
asked if he would cooperate in a congressional request for an 
immediate and thorough investigation of whether documents had been 
withheld from lawmakers bush said i would refer them to the 
people that were in charge of the documentation which could be mr 
culvahouse and company in whom i have great confidence but if 
theres anything we can do to encourage that absolutely 
a white house spokesman asked about the presidents promise of 
cooperation said he did not know specifically what the pledge 
might mean 
as for his own role in the irancontra affair bush said im 
not discussing anything about my role in this except to say that 
everything ive said in the past ill stand behind 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said irancontra 
documents from the reagan administration had been in the control of 
the fbi and independent counsel and now were being handled by the 
archives 
he said the bush white house did not have direct control 
over the material asked what bush could do to carry out his 
promise for full cooperation fitzwater said i dont know 
but he said the white house had no intention of looking into the 
documents the white house has never investigated itself and 
were not going to start now we have no role in this

defense secretary dick cheney wants to cut the 
midgetman missile attack submarines new fighter jets troop 
transport planes and some funding for star wars from the 1990 
budget congressional sources say 
warren nelson an aide to the house armed services committee 
said thursday the cuts are in a draft report cheney sent to the 
military branches but he warned the recommendations could change 
in the final report 
cheney is making adjustments to the 1990 budget submitted by 
former president reagan in order to meet the goals of a budget 
compromise worked out a week ago between the white house and 
congress the agreement calls for spending 2992 billion on 
defense which requires trimming 10 billion from the budget reagan 
submitted 
cheney is expected to present a package of cuts to congress next 
week 
nelson said cheneys draft report called for the elimination of 
funding for new f14d tomcat fighter jets the v22 osprey troop 
transport aircraft and the midgetman missile as well as the last of 
two submarines in the los angeles class 
in addition the preliminary report recommended slicing in half 
funding for f18 fighters stretching out the purchasing plan for 
the b2 bomber cutting funds for the strategic defense initiative 
reducing various helicopter programs and decommissioning an 
aircraft carrier 
rep george hochbrueckner dny said cheney has kicked 
upstairs to the white house decisions on what he described as the 
most controversial cutback recommendations the f14 the los 
angeles class subs midgetman and the sdi reductions 
right now the ball is in the white house court 
hochbrueckner said he declined to reveal the source of his 
information 
the planned elimination of the two attack submarines already 
spurred lobbying by lawmakers from the eastern seaboard the subs 
are made at the electric boat shipyard in connecticut 
sen john h chafee rri a former navy secretary on 
thursday wrote a letter to cheney that criticized any move to 
eliminate the sub funding as short sighted in terms of our 
national security requirements 
chafee pointed to a recent independent report ordered by the 
house armed services committee that detailed major advances in 
soviet submarine technology 
i hope you will agree that it would be a serious mistake for 
the united states to curtail the ssn688 program at this time he 
said 
congressional aides said the submarines were vulnerable to the 
budget ax because they were scheduled to be the last two of the los 
angeles class series the los angeles series will be replaced by 
the ssn21 seawolfs

confusion among doctors about the legal and 
medical definition of brain dead is common and may deprive some 
people of lifesaving organ transplants doctors say 
health professionals have personal concepts of death that vary 
widely and are often confused and or selfcontradictory 
according to authors of a study led by dr stuart j youngner of 
case western reserve university school of medicine in cleveland 
but the findings should not be taken to mean that doctors are 
declaring patients brain dead when they are not say authors of 
related articles accompanying the study published in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
rather they might be hesitant in making a diagnosis of brain 
death if they were uncertain about what it is to be brain dead 
said one author dr joseph m darby director of trauma and 
neurosurgical intensive care at presbyterianuniversity hospital in 
pittsburgh 
confusion and or delays amongst healthcare personnel might be 
an impediment to organ retrieval he said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
researchers in cleveland asked 195 health professionals at four 
university affiliated hospitals there to answer the question 
what brain functions must be lost for a patient to be declared 
brain dead 
the professionals included 39 doctors likely to be required to 
make direct decisions about brain death and 156 doctors and nurses 
who might be involved in the care of braindead patients the 
researchers said 
thirtythree of the 39 decisionmakers or 85 percent selected 
the correct multiple choice answer irreversible loss of all 
brain function ninety of the 156 others or 58 percent picked 
the right answer the researchers reported 
incorrect answers included loss of function of the brain stem 
which is necessary for consciousness loss of function of the 
cortex which is necessary for higher reasoning and severe brain 
damage the researchers said 
in addition they probed the subjects personal ideas about what 
constitutes death researchers found that even among professionals 
who knew the medical criterion for brain death contradictions were 
common about why such a criterion indicates a person is really dead 
fortytwo percent of the whole group consistently said the loss 
of higher brain function or the loss of lower brain function was 
the reason a braindead person is really dead but 58 percent did 
not use a coherent concept of death consistently the researchers 
said 
such confusion could hamper efforts to obtain donor organs 
since the ability to obtain them from suitable donors depends 
largely on the attitude and commitment of health professionals the 
researchers said 
lack of understanding of why braindead patients are dead may 
not only contribute to professionals discomfort in managing such 
patients it may also discourage doctors from discussing possible 
donation with families the researchers said 
darby in an accompanying article on the medical management of 
braindead donors cited figures indicating that 10000 to 15000 
donor organs are needed each year while 12500 to 27000 potential 
us donors die annually only 15 percent to 20 percent of 
potential donors become actual donors he and his colleagues said

sen alan simpson is stalling president bushs 
choice to run the epas clean air and nuclear programs because of 
his ignorance of the problem of airborne radioactive dust from 
mining uranium and other minerals 
simpson rwyo on thursday put a hold on the confirmation of 
william rosenberg a real estate executive from ann arbor mich 
using a parliamentary device 
his interest is in resolving the problems said mary kay 
hill an aide to simpson he is certainly not trying to torpedo 
an individual 
simpson had asked rosenberg to comment on the question of 
airborne radioactive material and fugitive dust produced from 
mining for uranium and other minerals 
the nominee didnt indicate that he understood the issue at 
all hill said 
environmental regulations set limits on the amount of such 
particles that can be released into the air simpson maintains that 
the epa should make allowances for particles placed in the air by 
natural causes such as the brisk wyoming wind hill said 
the senate environment committee approved rosenbergs nomination 
on tuesday 151 simpson was the lone dissenter 
rosenberg was chairman of the michigan public service 
commission which regulates utilities from 1973 to 1975 and moved 
from that job to a position as assistant administrator for energy

despite a declining rate of spina bifida cases in 
the united states the birth defect still leaves thousands of 
american children struggling to live with its effects often at 
tremendous cost 
the national centers for disease control predicted thursday that 
by the end of 1990 the united states will have 13000 children 
born with spina bifida in the 1980s and still living at an annual 
cost of nearly 100 million 
each year about 1500 children are born in the united states 
with spina bifida the incomplete closing of the bony structure 
surrounding the spinal cord more than 1000 survive the newborn 
days and enter childhood the cdc said in its weekly report 
an estimated 9800 children born with spina bifida between 1980 
and 1987 were still alive in 1987 and by the end of 1990 that 
number is expected to grow to an estimated 13000 
in 1990 the average annual cost for medical and surgical care 
for all surviving children born with spina bifida since 1980 will 
approach 100 million the atlantabased cdc reported further 
the number of surviving spina bifida patients born before 1980 is 
as large as those born after 1980 it is likely that their 
costs would equal or exceed those of the post1980 patients 
spina bifida often strikes along with anencephaly the absence 
of major parts of the brain in that case most patients die a few 
hours after birth for the spina bifida patients who survive life 
is expensive 
infants with spina bifida routinely receive vigorous medical 
therapy and undergo repeated surgical procedures to survive and 
reach their maximum functional capacity the cdc said noting 
that the lifetime costs for such a patient can reach 250000 
the cause of spina bifida is still unknown but the disease rate 
is decreasing from a rate of 52 cases per 10000 births in 1980 
to 43 in 1987 nobody really knows why said dr david 
erickson a cdc birth defects specialist 
some of the decrease is due to new hightechnology prenatal 
testing which gives more mothers the option of terminating problem 
pregnancies but that doesnt explain all of it erickson said

organizations representing the elderly say 
theyre encouraged about the prospects for a reduction in the 
surtax paid for coverage of catastrophic illness under the medicare 
program 
sen lloyd bentsen said thursday that revised revenue estimates 
from the congressional budget office and the joint committee on 
taxation show that the government may be collecting more money than 
it needs for the program he said the new projections indicate a 
49 billion surplus for the period 19891993 
bentsen who heads the senate finance committee said he sent a 
letter to treasury secretary nicholas brady asking whether the bush 
administration concurs with the revised revenue estimates 
the congressional budget office concludes that the surplus in 
the catastrophic care funds is twice as large as originally 
estimated two times bigger than needed to provide adequate reserve 
and contingency margins bentsen said 
he suggested that the surtax could be cut at least 16 
percent if the projections are accurate 
the supplemental premium or surtax enacted in the medicare 
catastrophic coverage act of 1988 is paid by medicare recipients 
whose federal income tax is at least 150 annually the tax 
increases according to income up to a ceiling of 800 
bentsens letter said the cap on the supplemental premium 
could be reduced to 500 if the projections by cbo and the tax 
panel are correct 
horace deets executive director of the american association for 
retired persons said the organization was delighted to hear that 
beneficiaries may pay less for the expanded medicare coverage 
the biggest estimating difficulty we had is identifying how 
the elderly are spread across the income levels said ronald 
pearlman staff director for the tax panel in explaining the new 
figures 
bentsen and pearlman emphasized that the figures were 
preliminary pearlman added that the new estimates were not based 
on current revenue collection or a change in the economy but 
instead were based on the tax panels use of different economic 
models from those used during congressional debate before the 
bills passage last year 
since the beginning of the year when the law went into effect 
members of congress have been flooded with mail from older 
americans objecting to the tax which the lawmakers and former 
president reagan agreed should be paid solely by beneficiaries of 
the program 
but it was never our intention that the beneficiaries pay more 
than needed to operate this program in a prudent responsible 
fashion said bentsen 
there are two reasons for us to interpret this as 
encouraging said eric shulman legislative director for the 
national council of senior citizens 
one is that hopefully this new revenue will yield tangible and 
significant reduction in premiums the other is that it may open 
the door to some reconsideration of the financing mechanism said 
shulman

the department of energy is calling the 
approval of a fullpower operating license for the shoreham nuclear 
power plant perhaps the most important development for the nuclear 
industry in a decade but new york gov mario cuomo has vowed to 
appeal the decision 
the bitterly divided response came as the nuclear regulatory 
commission voted 40 on thursday to award a fullpower license to 
the long island plant 
the nrcs fullpower license for shoreham is an emblem of 
hypocrisy cuomo said in a statement from albany ny we will 
of course appeal 
doe on the other hand saw the development as a milestone 
because it marked the first time a plant has been licensed on the 
basis of a utilitydrawn evacuation plan sidestepping the 
opposition of local communities 
the nrcs decision reaffirms its confidence not only in the 
safety and viability of shoreham but in the entire us nuclear 
industry as well energy secretary james d watkins said if 
put into operation shoreham could spur the recovery of the 
industry from the erosion of public confidence that followed the 
accident at three mile island in 1979 
his department called the shoreham license perhaps the most 
important development for the nuclear industry in the united states 
in the past decade 
but the license may prove to be only a symbol since the long 
island lighting co which owns the 809megawatt reactor has 
agreed not to turn up the power pending a vote by shareholders to 
scrap the 55 billion plant 
after the vote thursday nrc chairman lando zech said the 
commission had fulfilled its duties without regard to whether 
shoreham ever operates 
our responsibility as the nuclear regulatory commission is to 
review the application for a license and to determine whether that 
application meets our requirements zech told reporters we 
have made such a determination 
zech said the refusal of the state and local governments to 
participate in emergency planning has been a challenge to this 
commission 
asked if he thought it was a waste that shoreham might never 
operate zech said as the chairman of the regulatory commission 
thats not my responsibility as an american citizen i would call 
it a waste 
the vote by lilco shareholders which must take place by june 
15 will make or break a deal under which lilco would sell shoreham 
to new york state for 1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate 
increases the state would then oversee the decommissioning and 
dismantling of the plant that was once touted as the solution to 
long islands energy shortages 
shoreham becomes the first us nuclear plant to be licensed on 
the basis of a utilityformulated emergency plan rather than one 
created by the state and local governments 
lilco was forced to draw up its own plan after the governments 
of new york state suffolk county and the town of southampton 
withdrew support for the plant contending the zone around shoreham 
could not be safely evacuated they cited long islands large 
population and the dearth of roads leading away from the plant as 
impediments 
rep george hochbrueckner a democrat whose district includes 
shoreham called the license an insult to the people of long 
island 
the people of long island are sick and tired of being bullied 
by a pronuclear nrc he said 
but lilco vice president joseph mcdonnell hailed the license as 
a prerequisite for establishing a national nuclear policy 
its been a long and difficult road but i maintain the 
fullpower license decision says clearly and definitively that 
shoreham is a safe plant and that the politicians who opposed this 
plant have been flat wrong he said

disabling headaches force people to miss an 
average of 1 days of work each year according to a new study that 
also reinforced earlier findings that women were afflicted more 
often and more seriously than men 
the study published in todays journal of the american medical 
association found that most people suffered 10 to 12 headaches each 
year and about 10 percent of all headaches are migraines 
distinguished from the common or tension headache by severe 
pain nausea or vomiting longer duration and a more acute reaction 
to sensory stimuli like light or noise 
headaches rank seventh among common complaints needing 
outpatient care and the national headache foundation estimates 
that direct and indirect costs for medical care and lost workdays 
are 6 billion to 10 billion annually 
walter stewart one of five authors of the journal report said 
researchers did not try to come up with a dollar figure 
the journal study involved telephone interviews with 10169 
residents of washington county md ages 12 to 29 
it was significant both because it focused on a largescale 
population at highest risk for the onset of serious headaches and 
because it gathered data on both longterm problems and headaches 
in the previous four weeks 
among its findings 
women who reported suffering headaches more often and more 
seriously than men missed an average 18 days annually compared 
to 12 days for men 
women said their headaches were of longer duration more 
painful and worsened with age duration and intensity remained 
largely constant with men as they aged 
the most pronounced disablity was reported by women 24 to 29 
the same group in which the least disability was described by males 
76 percent of females and 57 percent of males reported a 
headache in the previous four weeks 14 percent of females and 6 
percent of males reported four or more in that period for 
migraines 7 percent of females and 3 percent of males reported an 
episode in the fourweek period 
women said headaches on average last 82 hours compared 
with 59 hours for men 
the trends regarding occurrence and differences between men 
and women are not new said stewart an associate professor of 
epidemiology at johns hopkins school of hygiene and public health 
and right now we cant tell you why 
focusing on such facts will enable the public as well as victims 
to benefit said dr seymour diamond a chicagobased specialist 
whose headache clinic is the largest in the united states and ray 
dion executive director of the american association for the study 
of the headache 
people are being encouraged to seek us out as more and more 
discussion of the subject appears in both the medical and lay 
literature and this can only accelerate it said diamond 
whose nationally known clinic treats about 30000 patients annually 
it used to be rare that wed see a male patient because being 
treated for a headache didnt fit the macho image he added 
but that has changed gradually and thanks to the information and 
publicity from this study and others fewer people will view 
headaches as sign of a psychiatric disease or weakness 
people with allergies go to an allergist but based on the 
letters and phone calls we get few people with recurring headaches 
do anything beyond seeing a general practitioner said dion 
whose san clemente califbased organization serves as a 
clearinghouse for physician specialists 
every effort to educate the public is a welcome one he 
added

house speaker jim wrights wife kept no records of her work for 
an investment company formed by the wrights and another texas 
couple because it was a piddling little momandpop operation 
she said in interviews published today 
we were all friends betty wright told the washington post 
in an interview published in todays editions there was no 
reason to document anything i had some notes but i dont know 
where they are and they are probably thrown away by now 
in remarks published in todays new york times she said 
there was no time clock and we were not keeping records it was 
just the four of us we all trusted each other 
the speaker faces 69 allegations of house rules violations 
brought by the ethics committee among the accusations is that mrs 
wright was paid for work she did not do for the investment firm 
mallightco inc 
the 64yearold mrs wright along with her husband formed the 
company with friends from fort worth george and marlene mallick 
she said it was just part of the business arrangement if mallick 
gave her the use of a condominium in fort worth or if he gave her a 
cadillac 
i think it is unfair to criticize it because that is the way 
george mallick did business she told the times that is the 
way he operated other employees had condos and cars he had a 
fleet of cars i certainly dont think he was funneling anything to 
me it was just part of the employment she said 
she said she has been unfairly portrayed as a domineering 
scheming wife who liked to spend money on expensive things and 
coaxed her husband into politically risky financial ventures 
oh well they are making me a nancy reagan she said i 
felt sorry for her when they did it to her i dont know why they 
ever started on me 
neither jim nor i ever intended to evade the law in any way 
shape or form she told the post my god hes been there for 
30 years why all of a sudden would he do a shady thing like that 
he wouldnt jeopardize his career over a piddling little

california scientists have developed a test 
that they say can detect a virus thought to cause 90 percent of all 
hepatitis disease spread by blood transfusions 
the advent of the specific sensitive test should improve 
the safety of the worlds blood supply as well as provide an 
important clinical diagnostic tool said a report in this weeks 
edition of the journal science released today 
scientists at the chiron corp in emeryville calif report in 
one article on experiments that have characterized the antibodies 
to the virus causing a type of hepatitis called nona nonb it is 
thought to infect up to 10 percent of all blood transfusions 
type nona nonb is so named because it was of an unknown 
origin the chiron researchers have now labeled it hepatitis c or 
hcv 
the scientists report in a second article in the same journal 
that they developed a screening test that was able to successfully 
detect antibodies to the disease thus providing a method of 
testing blood transfusions for the presence of the virus 
hepatitis is an infectious disease that attacks the liver 
though most patients with hepatitis recover with few lingering 
effects the disease can cause serious and sometimes fatal 
complications it can lead to cirrhosis a hardening and gradual 
failure of the liver that can cause death the disease also has 
been associated with liver cancer 
to verify the hcv screening test the researchers analyzed coded 
blood samples from 16 patients the patients included nine who were 
proven by other tests to have hepatitis c five normal blood 
donors a patient with alcoholic hepatitis and a patient with 
biliary cirrhosis a liver disease 
the chiron assay detected hepatitis c antibodies in all but two 
of those infected with the disease 
next the researchers tested the 138 blood donations that had 
been given to 10 patients who later developed chronic hepatitis c 
with only one exception the tests found hepatitis c infection in 
at least one blood donor for each of the blood transfusion 
recipients this showed the test could successfully screen donated 
blood and identify those samples that were infected hepatitis c 
antibodies were not detected in a control group of blood samples 
tested at the same time 
a further test was conducted on samples obtained from patients 
in italy and in japan the antibodies were detected in 84 percent 
of the italian patients who had been diagnosed with the hepatitis 
infection for the japanese patients 78 percent were found to be 
positive for chronic infection and 15 percent with acute 
infection a less serious condition that is healing

a century after this sleepy railway stop 
emerged from the prairie as a teeming tent city crowds again are 
converging on this historic territorial capital 
on april 22 1889 more than 40000 anxious settlers toed the 
borders of 2 million acres of unassigned lands to claim 160acre 
farms or town lots 
they came by train on horseback and on foot in wagons and on 
bicycles pushing carts and driving oxen to one of the nations 
last frontiers 
this weekend organizers of centennial observances in guthrie 
say they are preparing for traffic jams when up to 100000 people 
show up for parades reenactments rodeos and other events in the 
central oklahoma community of 10300 
the run of 89 the first of five land runs used to settle 
land in the former indian territory marked the first white 
settlement in what would become the 46th state in 1907 
although some indian groups are participating others object to 
the festivities 
were in the ghetto while the people who stole our land are 
enjoying prosperity said francis wise a member of an 
organization of groups calling itself the tribal voices coalition 
in all the festivities where indians are included throughout 
this land run celebration were being asked to put on feathers and 
dance and sing and help the white community celebrate the land 
run she said theyre asking us to dance on the graves of our 
people 
historians say there is little argument that the government 
cheated indians out of their land in oklahoma organizers of 
centennial observances say they have tried to be sensitive to 
indian concerns 
after the civil war cowboys drove cattle from texas to kansas 
over the chisholm trail through oklahoma until a railroad connected 
gainesville texas and arkansas city kan in 1887 
guthrie and the future oklahoma city became minor rail stops on 
that line 
the focus of the yearlong series of celebrations and tourism 
promotion efforts is the historic district of guthrie where 40 
blocks of victorian buildings recall the years guthrie served as 
territorial and state capital 
both guthrie on cottonwood creek and oklahoma city to the 
south along the santa fe railroad tracks were born fullgrown on 
that single day in 1889 each with an estimated overnight 
population of more than 10000 
guthrie became the territorial capital graced with fine 
architecture of the period and a bustling downtown it served as 
the state capital until 1910 when the state seal moved to oklahoma 
city in what guthrie residents still consider a case of theft 
oklahoma city continued to grow into a city of more than 
400000 while guthrie stayed much as it was but such lack of 
growth has turned into an asset 
by the town almost being forgotten for a number of years it 
preserved the history and the heritage said carol ringrose a 
spokeswoman for the local centennial observance 
in 1975 1400 acres of guthrie was placed in the national 
register of historic places nearly half of the 4700 homes in the 
town are certified victorian restorations aim at making the city a 
living museum

choice to run the epas clean air and nuclear programs because 
simpson contends the nominee shows no understanding of the problem 
of airborne radioactive dust from mining uranium and other minerals 
simpson rwyo on thursday put a hold on the confirmation of 
william rosenberg a real estate executive from ann arbor mich 
using a parliamentary device 
his interest is in resolving the problems said mary kay 
hill an aide to simpson he is certainly not trying to torpedo 
an individual 
simpson had asked rosenberg to comment on the question of 
airborne radioactive material and fugitive dust produced from 
mining for uranium and other minerals 
the nominee didnt indicate that he understood the issue at 
all hill said 
environmental regulations set limits on the amount of such 
particles that can be released into the air simpson maintains that 
the epa should make allowances for particles placed in the air by 
natural causes such as the brisk wyoming wind hill said 
the senate environment committee approved rosenbergs nomination 
on tuesday 151 simpson was the lone dissenter 
rosenberg was chairman of the michigan public service 
commission which regulates utilities from 1973 to 1975 and moved 
from that job to a position as assistant administrator for energy 
resource development with the federal energy administration he 
left that position in 1977

the coast guard boarding of a taiwanese ship 
suspected of illegal driftnetting demonstrates us concern over a 
fishing technique that can wipe out large numbers of sea creatures

this is a very serious matter and it would be an 
understatement to say this heightens the issue ed wolfe the 
state departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries said

fishing at all it is wasteful and inefficient 
an estimated 700 fishing boats from taiwan south korea and 
japan have been using driftnets in the northern pacific ocean to 
catch squid since the early 1980s the nets are up to 35 miles long 
and can cover more than 30000 square miles of ocean 
us fishermen charge the nets snare north american salmon and 
the illegal catches have already impacted fish runs in alaska

the idea that wealth brings happiness is 
suffering a blow from medical researchers who say depression is 
striking more often in affluent nations particularly among younger 
people 
its sort of a paradox that the babyboom generation 
physically is the healthiest generation in history and grew up in 
a time of great economic prosperity and yet they have this sense 
of malaise and disappointment said dr gerald klerman coauthor 
of a new report 
klerman of the cornell university medical college and colleague 
myrna weissman reviewed 13 studies of depression involving more 
than 30000 people their findings were published in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
the researchers analyzed data on hospital admissions 
psychiatric diagnoses and suicides and found a marked increase in 
depression among the postworld war ii baby boomers in north 
america and western europe 
they also said the problem has become more prevalent among young 
men and teenagers though their report supplied no figures 
klerman said the research showed people ages 15 to 40 in north 
america and europe were about twice as likely to experience 
depression in the 1960s and 1970s than they were before world war 
ii 
depression seems to be the price of civilization klerman 
said 
ms weissman an epidemiologist at the new york state 
psychiatric institute said depression used to be a disorder of 
middleaged women the strange thing you see happening is 
depression is starting in adolescents 
the researchers found that in each of 10 surveys from the united 
states canada sweden germany and new zealand depression 
increased among people born after the end of world war ii 
but in three studies of people in korea puerto rico and 
mexicanamericans living in los angeles the researchers found 
little difference in the rates of depression between those born 
before and those born after the war 
they speculated that the lower depression rate in those 
societies could stem from stronger family ties and less mobility 
and the americaneuropean rate could be boosted by drug use 
were always making or breaking attachment bonds klerman 
said we give up some of the social supports and stable 
relationships 
mark walker who works in the adolescent psychiatry program at 
northwestern memorial hospital in chicago said the study appears 
to debunk the idea that wealth brings happiness 
its interesting that these increasing rates of depression 
have happened in western nations during a period of relative 
prosperity walker said for society as a whole affluence does 
not seem to protect people from getting depressed but in fact it 
may be a risk factor 
walker also speculated that the increasing rates of depression 
and suicide among youth could be a result of postwar wealth in 
north america and europe 
young people lack a certain degree of meaning in their 
lives he said that is a result of an increasingly affluent 
society able to support people having a longer adolescence when 
they do not have to work to survive

for a few seconds interior 
secretary manuel lujan jr tottered this way and that on an 
oilslickened rock a worker laboring to rid the shore of gooey oil 
stepped in and saved him from an embarrassing fall 
while lujan and two congressman were touring a section of the 
prince william sound shoreline thursday a giant soviet oil skimmer 
was testing its booms at resurrection bay some 80 miles west in the 
gulf of alaska 
the coast guard plainly was delighted with the promise of 
progress brought by the 425foot vaidogubsky and gains made by a 
120foot mr clean iii a skimmer from santa barbara calif 
this was a major step having those two skimmers out there 
said coast guard lt gary stock who was monitoring the cleanup in 
anchorage 
exxon spokesman henry beathard in valdez estimated that more 
than 2 million gallons of the 101 milliongallon spill was 
recoverable from the surface of the gulf and prince william sound 
the spill occurred march 24 after the tanker exxon valdez hit bligh 
reef 
lujan reps don young ralaska and curt weldon rpa and a 
sizable entourage flew from valdez on thursday by helicopter to 
naked island a remote beach 45 miles to the southwest 
the group got a look at the only area in prince william sound 
where shoreline cleanup operations have started exxon estimates it 
has cleaned 2100 feet of the more than 300 miles of oilsplotched 
shore 
as lujan inspected the cleanup effort oil glistened off rocks 
or stood in gleaming puddles in the bright sun a black stain along 
the driftwoodstrewn beach marked the hightide line the smell of 
crude was strong 
from a distance the shore was a palette of oilsmeared workers 
clad in hard hats and bright orange yellow and black rainwear 
they used fire hoses to blast oil off a 75yard stretch of rocky 
beach as the sun played through the mist casting rainbows 
landing craft laden with heavy equipment hugged the shore and 
an oil skimmer dipped up the runoff from the beach facing mcpherson 
passage 
lujan wearing an orange float suit picked his way to the end 
of the beach nearest his aircraft and in moments was posing with a 
fire hose for photographs 
before it was over several of the secretarys traveling 
companions had joined him laughing they enthusiastically blasted 
the oily mess with such force that it carried over a boom and into 
the water workers were trying to protect that sparked an obscenity 
laced tirade from people on a barge nearby 
retreating lujan said it looks like this is going to be a 
big job to clean up 
but he said it was too early for him to know what he would tell 
president bush come monday 
lujan and the congressmen were briefed early thursday by the 
us coast guard in valdez then by exxon officials 
weldon a member of the houses merchant marine and fisheries 
committee said he was unimpressed 
there were a lot of people covering their rear ends he said 
weldon noted the two briefings covered essentially the same 
ground but they were completely diametrically opposed 
he said the question that must be answered is why if there 
were a contingency plan it was not implemented almost immediately 
after the spill 
young credited the beach workers with making some headway 
theyre making progress thats the big thing he said 
vice president dan quayle will stop in anchorage and valdez on 
may 45 as he returns from a pacific rim excursion and will tour 
spill sites us sen frank murkowski ralaska said

human rights activist andrei d sakharov 
initially eliminated from the ballot won a seat in the soviet 
unions new parliament in a repeat election by the academy of 
sciences the tass news agency reported today 
tass announced preliminary results of thursdays balloting for 
12 parliamentary seats to be filled by the prestigious academy 
also elected to the congress of peoples deputies were space 
scientist roald z sagdeev economist nikolai shmelev and georgy a 
arbatov director of the usa and canada institute 
tass said shmelev who has proposed radical solutions to the 
soviet unions economic problems won the most votes 869 of 1101 
sakharov received 806 and sagdeev received 739 it said 
sakharov sagdeev and shmelev were among a slate of reformers on 
the list of 28 candidates other reformers who won election were 
vitaly ginzburg and yuri karyakin tass said 
the 2250member congress will meet for the first time on may 25 
to choose from among its members the countrys president and a 
supreme soviet which will make policy for the nation 
sakharovs election will be a great success for perestroika 
said one of his backers alexander sobianen using the word for 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reform program 
sakharov originally was nominated for the congress in january 
but the academys screening committee eliminated him and other 
reformers when it cut the list of candidates on the final ballot 
from more than 100 to 23 
however sakharovs supporters including sobianen charged that 
the nominees were oldstyle academic bureaucrats and organized a 
campaign to reject them in the first election last month only 
eight of the 23 received more than 50 percent of the vote 
this time 28 candidates were nominated for the 12 seats still 
open and sakharov sagdeev shmelev and other reformers were 
nominated once again 
sakharov a physicist voted thursday morning at a polling 
station at moscow state university he made no comment to reporters 
sakharov winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize for his rights 
activities was exiled to the closed city of gorky in january 1980 
for criticizing the soviet intervention in afghanistan in 1986 
gorbachev allowed him to return to moscow 
sakharov has since resumed his scientific work and continues to 
speak out on social issues he supports gorbachevs reforms but 
criticizes what he sees as efforts to slow or reverse them 
in a speech to the academy wednesday night sakharov again 
criticized two laws that allow authorities to use special troops to 
quell demonstrations 
sakharov blamed the april 9 clash in tbilisi the capital of 
soviet georgia on such laws and on forces opposed to reforms 
at least 20 people died when soldiers moved into a crowd of 
demonstrators on tbilisis main street a commission is 
investigating charges that soldiers used poison gas shovels and 
clubs 
hundreds of academy members voted to support a resolution of its 
branch in georgia that called the incident an unprecedented 
massive beating of innocent people 
the communist party trade unions and social and professional 
groups such as the academy will elect 750 congressional members 
the 1500 others are elected from geographical districts 
in balloting for the geographical districts on march 26 voters 
rejected dozens of top party and government officials many of whom 
were running unopposed 
repeat elections will be held may 14 for almost 200 seats that 
remain unfilled

zipping through space 267 billion miles 
from earth the voyager 2 spacecraft changed course in a maneuver 
that targeted it for its aug 24 picturetaking encounter with 
neptune 
thursdays trajectory change took place 183 million miles from 
neptune as the hardy space probe cruised at a speed of 42279 mph 
said mary beth murrill spokeswoman for nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
radio commands sent by mission controllers traveled at the speed 
of light nearly 670 million mph but still took four hours to 
reach the distant voyager 2 which started its journey in 1977 and 
explored jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 
the commands made voyager 2 fire some of its thrusters and 
adjust onboard gyroscopes to execute the course correction murrill 
said she added that it as one of the last major maneuvers needed 
to propel the probe toward the solar systems eighth planet 
this puts the spacecraft on target for neptune she said at 
the laboratory which operates americas unmanned space exploration 
program for the national aeronautics and space administration 
voyager 2 is scheduled to take numerous television pictures as 
it swoops within 3013 miles of neptunes cloud tops aug 24 
the spacecraft is controlled with radio commands sent through 
nasas deep space network which includes large dishshaped 
antennas in goldstone calif spain and australia 
the latest maneuver was performed during a week of simulations 
in which the voyager team is rehearsing what they will be doing 
during the neptune encounter murrill said 
scientists believe neptune probably has a watery atmosphere that 
slowly blends into an underlying ocean with no clear boundary 
between sky and sea they believe triton one of neptunes two 
known moons which the spacecraft also will fly by has methane and 
water ices on its surface and possibly lakes or an ocean of liquid 
nitrogen 
after encountering neptune voyager 2 will head out of the solar 
system and conduct studies of interstellar space 
its twin voyager 1 also was launched in 1977 but explored 
only jupiter and saturn before heading toward the edge of the solar 
system 
nasa officials have said the voyager flights which scientists 
have called humanitys most productive space exploration effort 
will cost 920 million by 1995 less than half what the pentagon 
spends during a single work day 
the voyagers discovered at least 17 previously unknown moons 
orbiting jupiter saturn and uranus

13228yen closing on thursday the us currency opened lower at 
13135 yen and ranged from 13130 to 13175 yen during the day 
the dollars lower opening was because of announcements of 
interest rate hikes in west germany and other european nations

west germanys central bank raised its official discount rate by 
half a percentage point to 45 percent effective today while 
similar moves were taken by central banks in the netherlands 
austria and denmark 
investors began speculating over a possible interest rate hike 
by japanese monetary authorities in the near future and bought the 
yen he said 
but investors then slowed down their yenbuying following 
comments by japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama this 
morning ikeda added 
murayama said early today that he saw no need at the moment to 
raise the countrys official discount rate 
i dont see any need for a change in credit conditions 
murayama told a news conference following a regular cabinet meeting 
on the stock exchange prices were lower throughout the day 
because of the european interest rate hikes and higher oil prices 
said kenji ishizuka of daiwa securities 
oil prices surpassed 22 per barrel following an explosion on a 
north sea oil rig two days ago 
the nikkei index plunged in early trading but then made up some 
of its losses toward the end of the morning session following

cheaper prices a majority of participants were reluctant to buy 
ahead of the weekend daiwas ishizuka said 
trading was moderate with volume on the markets first section 
estimated at 900 million shares unchanged from thursday among the 
winners were construction and food issues

two japanese defense force airplanes scrambled 
after what was believed to be a soviet aircraft that twice today 
crossed into japans northern airspace a defense agency official 
said 
the aircraft intruded into japanese airspace at 236 am 
crossing from north to south over rebun a small island off japans 
main island of hokkaido 500 miles northwest of tokyo the official 
said 
at 351 am near the same area what local radar monitoring 
officials called a largesized aircraft flew from the east 
toward the south said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the intruding aircraft was in japanese airspace for 3 minutes 
the official said 
japans airspace begins 12 nautical miles from shore 
judging from the flying course the aircraft took we believed 
it might be a soviet electronics reconnaissance plane the 
defense official said 
in both cases two f15 jet fighters were rushed from chitose 
air base on hokkaido but could not identify the aircraft because it 
had already left japanese airspace the official said he said a 
japanese air force radar site on hokkaido warned the aircraft twice 
in russian but received no reply 
japans foreign ministry today lodged a strong protest with the 
soviet union over the alleged soviet intrusion a foreign ministry 
official said 
kazuhiko togo chief of the ministrys soviet division summoned 
georgy komarovsky councillor at the soviet embassy in tokyo to 
the ministry and told him the incident was extremely 
regrettable the official said togo asked the soviet union to 
take steps to prevent the recurrence of a similar incident 
the official quoted komarovsky as telling togo that he had 
heard nothing about the occurrence of a violation of airspace 
but komarovsky was quoted as telling togo he would convey the 
japanese protest and request to his government 
it was the first violation by a foreign aircraft of japans 
airspace since a soviet tu16 badger bomber violated japanese 
airspace over okinawa in december 1987 
in that incident two japanese jet fighters scrambled from an 
okinawa base and one fired live ammunition as warning shots at the 
soviet plane it was the first time for a japanese fighter to fire 
warning shots at a soviet aircraft since the defense agency assumed 
air defense responsibility in 1958 
todays incident brought the number of violations of japans 
airspace since then to 21 most of which by soviet aircraft the 
defense official said

nbc was so afraid of hostile advocacy groups 
and unnerving advertisers that it shot its dramatization of the 
landmark court case that legalized abortion under two phony script 
titles 
the network also insisted on numerous script rewrites invited 
an antiabortion activist to view roe vs wade before its may 
15 broadcast and tried to prevent the films author director and 
producer from giving interviews 
theyre just terrified of everything at this point said 
screenwriter alison cross 
said the films star holly hunter i know what theyre 
worried about theyre afraid well say something were not 
supposed to say but the script has a point of view and so 
does history 
nbcs fear of an assault from the antiabortion lobby and the 
possibility of advertiser defections runs so deep that the 
networks depiction of the legal pursuit of abortion rights nearly 
ended with the suggestion that the court decision be overturned 
it was our fear that in the effort to make this piece balanced 
we were going to bend over so far backwards that it was going to 
end up prolife said cross referring to herself and roe vs 
wade executive producer michael mannheim 
and there were a couple of drafts where i felt that i 
had made all these little changes and i didnt realize how 
cumulative they were until finally at the end you look at the 
script and you say boy this is a hell of a propaganda piece for 
the other side said cross who was reached independently after 
nbc refused to make her available for interviews 
but why is nbc so afraid to take even the slightest position on 
an issue that is after all the law and that a majority of 
americans support 
the answer speaks loudly to both the fervor of the abortion 
debate and the growing clout that advocacy groups wield over the 
entertainment industry evidenced by the religious rights outrage 
over the last temptation of christ which led some theater 
chains to refuse to exhibit the movie 
next wednesday the supreme court is to hear arguments in a key 
abortion rights case from missouri that could eventually mean roe 
vs wade will be overturned or substantially limited 
anthony masucci senior vice president of nbcs movies for 
television and miniseries said he thought the story made for 
what i thought was dramatic compelling television without 
necessarily getting on a soapbox and preaching about anything 
but as soon as cross sat down to write the screenplay though 
it became clear that the networks interpretation of preaching 
ran far and wide 
cross had trouble getting the phrase women are dying into 
the script and couldnt use the issue of coat hangers in reference 
to illegal abortions because she said the network considered them 
inflammatory and excessive 
there were more than 17 drafts finally we couldnt even 
number them anymore cross said we just put dates on them i 
have a whole shelf full of them 
rosalyn weinman nbcs vice president of program standards and 
community relations said it is absolutely inaccurate to say 
nbc tried to soften the movies inherent prochoice stance there 
was no pressure to make this more prochoice or more prolife 
weinman said 
but while the parties involved say they believe the final script 
is fair to both sides the number of rewrites illustrates 
hollywoods anxiety over protests 
under pressure recently from viewers and special interest 
groups advertisers have pulled out of nbcs saturday night 
live the fox broadcasting corps married with children and 
abcs canceled heartbeat 
i think if this movie were on a year and a half ago wed 
probably be less cautious then we are said masucci there are 
some fringe elements out there and we dont want to raise their 
hackles in any way shape or form

jurors celebrated with a cake as the mcmartin 
preschool molestation trial ended its second year but no one was 
rejoicing at the length of the marathon case which is about to 
become los angeles longest trial 
the number of jurors and alternates has dwindled from the 
original 18 to 14 12 regulars and two alternates and the judge 
has worried aloud that more dropouts could cause a mistrial for 
lack of 12 jurors to decide the case 
when one juror suggested last week that he would have to leave 
if his company stops paying his salary the judge said he might 
propose that the county pay the jurors salary to insure completion 
of the trial jurors in the mcmartin trial are paid only 10 a day 
but paying more would be worth it the judge indicated to 
ensure that the 15 million already spent on the trial doesnt go 
to waste 
raymond buckey 30 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 
are charged with 65 counts of conspiracy and child molestation 
involving 11 children who attended the onceprestigious mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach 
i thank you for enduring with us superior court judge 
william pounders told the jurors thursday testimony from 99 
witnesses has filled 50000 transcript pages 
we want to conclude this trial in a reasonable time he 
said and we are dedicated to that 
he has said he knows jurors are frustrated with the extended 
proceedings in spite of that they arrived in court with what he 
called one of the largest cakes ive ever seen 
next week the mcmartin trial will surpass the record of los 
angeles previous longest running trial the hillside strangler 
case of angelo buono which lasted two years and three days 
outside court prosecution and defense lawyers were in agreement 
on one thing the trial has lasted too long 
deputy district attorney lael rubin who said she has spent five 
years on prosecution of the case saw the trials duration as a 
flaw in the california criminal justice system 
this is a case that should have been tried over a much shorter 
period she said what it shows is that the criminal justice 
system in california is slow and unwieldy 
buckeys attorney danny davis said the case has dragged on 
because it was a noncase whipped up by people who had differing 
ambitios that were not in the interest of this institution or the 
children 
he said he was concerned from the outset that the passage of 
time blurred the memories of children who testified 
whatever the result he predicted well never be happy 
that we know what happened

the 16inch guns on the uss iowa which can lob 
a shell the weight of a volkswagen 23 miles have an outdated 
design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age critics say 
theyre oldfashioned and inherently dangerous they all ought 
to be eliminated retired rear adm eugene larocque of the center 
for defense information said thursday i dont know what more it 
takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no 
longer appropriate on warships 
but the navy defended the 16inch gun the mightiest in use on 
any ocean after an explosion killed 47 sailors wednesday aboard 
the battleship iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target 
practice 
this gun remains the finest naval gun in the world it was 
the pinnacle of gun design art and it is still a frontline 
system said capt larry seaquist commander of the iowa until 
last may 
the main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed 
in silk bags to fire 16inchdiameter shells from its 62footlong 
barrel it works like the breechloaded guns that roared during the 
civil war a shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with 
gunpowder in a separate package 
in the iowas case 660 pounds of powder six 110pound bags 
is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2700 pounds at a 
speed of 2500 feet per second an electric spark ignites the 
powder 
the extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the 
burst but some redhot debris may remain or explosive gases can 
build up in the barrel air pressurized to 3000 pounds per square 
inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard 
against a blowback which happens when powder ignites before 
the breech is closed 
in newer guns powder is packed in metal containers missiles 
the backbone of the modern navys attack capability have 
integrated propellants 
capt james bush of the center for defense information a 
private think tank often critical of pentagon policy said the iowa 
explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris a blowback 
or a mishap in the handling of powder 
it wasnt unexpected it wasnt a surprise this is dangerous 
technology its archaic bush said these are the only guns in 
the navy that still used bagged powder 
the navy said thursday that none of the guns in the iowa turret 
had been fired before the explosion took place 
the navy also on thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big 
guns found only on the iowa and its three sister battleships the 
new jersey the wisconsin and the missouri 
in a larger sense critics say the battleships themselves once 
the mainstay of gunboat diplomacy have outlived their purpose 
despite 16inchthick armor plating the battlewagons are 
vulnerable to submarine and missile attack the 20mile range of 
the 16inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be 
fired at much greater distances 
we can do almost anything with a missile and do it better 
bush said 
battleships reached their heyday in world war i and were 
intended to fight other ships 
the iowa first launched in 1942 was the first of an entire 
class of us battlewagons built to conquer japan 
it supported marine amphibious landings and shelled shore 
targets but the aircraft carrier emerged as the navys top weapon 
because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each 
other the iowa also fought off korea 
the iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs 
in the reagan administrations military buildup six years ago they 
were upgraded with tomahawk cruise missiles 20mm guns and harpoon 
missiles 
one of the battleships the new jersey bombarded syrian and 
druze positions in lebanon as part the us peacekeeping role in 
1983 but the 16inch guns often missed their targets which the 
navy blamed on unreliable powder from world war ii 
there was no military need to return these ships to active 
duty said the cdis larocque their only military utility is 
to bombard third world countries and the era of gunboat diplomacy 
is over

selections from alexander solzhenitsyns banned 
chronicle of stalins labor camps the gulag archipelago will 
be published this year by a literary journal a secretary at the 
magazine said today 
some chapters from the lengthy book will appear before years 
end in the monthly magazine novy mir valentina ivanovna said in a 
telephone interview 
the secretary refused to say who in the soviet leadership had 
approved publication of the gripping tale of repression under 
stalin kremlin officials have said such works still are off limits 
i am against the publication of a number works by 
solzhenitsyn and in the first place such works as lenin in 
zurich and the gulag archipelago communist party ideology 
chief vadim a medvedev told a news conference in november 
exposing soviets to such books would undermine society he said 
but the washington post in todays editions quoted novy mirs 
chief editor sergei p zalygin as saying in an interview that 
president mikhail s gorbachev supported publication of 
solzhenitsyns works ms ivanovna said zalygin would not be in his 
office and was immediately unreachable 
it was novy mir that published solzhenitsyns short novel one 
day in the life of ivan denisovich in november 1962 
the gulag is a triology that maintains widescale political 
repression began in the soviet union under founder vladimir i 
lenin 
zalygin had said last year he was negotiating for the rights to 
print solzhenitsyns novel cancer ward ms ivanovna said no 
decision had been made about publishing works of solzhenitsyn other 
than the gulag 
several writers artists and activists have clamored for 
publication of solzhenitsyns works citing gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost which among other things allows reexamination of sore 
points in soviet history like stalins reign of terror 
in february a journal of the soviet peace committee titled 
twentieth century and peace printed an appeal to reject officially 
sanctioned lies that solzhenitsyn wrote just before being exiled in 
1974 the journal also carried a commentary crediting solzhenitsyn 
for helping pave the way for gorbachevs reforms 
the reforms have led to publication of soviet authors that had 
been long banned others that have come into the open include the 
novel doctor zhivago by boris pasternak and the political 
satire heart of a dog by mikhail bulgakov 
solzhenitsyn was arrested branded a traitor and expelled for 
his writings 
solzhenitsyn 70 gained us citizenship in 1974 a nobel 
laureate he is living in rural isolation in vermont

a bill legalizing floating casinos on 
rivers and lakes in iowa is on its way to gov terry branstad who 
has pledged to sign it into law as a way of bolstering the states 
economy 
the house voted 5147 thursday to approve the measure without a 
vote to spare in reaching the required majority of the 100member 
body 
rep phil tyrrell a republican was among opponents who 
predicted dire consequences saying gambling would not be confined 
long to rivers and lakes 
like a sickness and a disease it spreads across the state of 
iowa said tyrrell well see all of the problems that follow 
the drugs and the prostitution as if iowa didnt have enough 
problems 
critics complained bitterly about intense lobbying pressure to 
reverse last weeks rejection of the same bill by three votes 
rep greg spenner a republican who voted against the bill last 
week said before the vote that he would switch sides because his 
phone had not stopped ringing 
the people in my district are in apparent disagreement with my 
earlier stance said spenner 
backers said eastern iowa badly needs multimilliondollar 
developments that have been proposed for the iowa side of the 
mississippi river in association with casino boats besides they 
said the state already has parimutuel betting bingo and a 
lottery so gambling is nothing new 
its hypocritical for us to deny another part of the state 
their form of gambling said rep mark haverland a democrat who 
is a united methodist minister 
i do not think gambling is a sin i think gambling is dumb and 
selfdestructive he said but i dont think gambling is the 
only thing thats legal dumb and selfdestructive 
we continue to delude ourselves into thinking that somehow we 
will find a magic button that will solve our financial problems 
said rep tom miller a republican 
backers painted a picture of 19th century riverboats plying the 
river and theme amusement parks providing wholesome family 
entertainment 
developer franklin fried of san diego issued a statement 
immediately after the vote saying iowa has laid the foundation 
for bringing a unique firstclass national tourist attraction to 
the midwest he promised to move ahead with plans for a 10 
million iowa queen riverboat 
under the bill the states racing commission would issue 
gambling licenses for boats on rivers and lakes with the 
commission setting the location and number 
the bill legalizes small stakes gambling with a 5 limit per 
bet and a 200 nightly loss limit the first boatload of gamblers

syrian forces today bombarded the 
christian enclave with rockets concentrating their attacks on the 
port of jounieh in an apparent effort to block the christians only 
route out of lebanon 
police had no immediate reports of casualties 
syrian gunners in moslem west beirut fired truckmounted bm21 
rocket launchers that shot 40 122mm rockets carrying 105pound 
warheads 
a police spokesman said the syrians fired every four hours on 
jounieh and the coastal highway running north from beirut in the 
christians crescentshaped 310squaremile enclave 
christian forces did not return the fire police said but 
moslems in west beirut continued to flee the city 
kuwaits alqabas daily newspaper said several arab states were 
seeking to persuade syria the main power broker in lebanon to 
accept a peacekeeping force it said the arab force could number 
several hundred officers and troops from six or seven arab 
states it did not name them 
the rocketing flared after a short lull wednesday in the battle 
between gen michel aouns mainly christian army units and an 
alliance of syrians and moslem druse militiamen 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations described the missile barrage as a message that a 
ferry service linking jounieh with larnaca cyprus should not 
resume 
the cypriot companies that run two ferries into jounieh 
suspended service two days ago after their vessels came under 
moslem rocket fire they have carried about 12000 christians and 
foreigners to cyprus in recent weeks 
however cypriot officials in larnaca said one of the ferries 
sailed for jounieh today because of the shelling the ferries have 
anchored 10 miles offshore and fleeing christians are shuttled out 
to the ships in small boats 
maj gen sami khatib commander of moslem units of lebanons 
divided army said jounieh and beirut ports would remain under 
blockade as long as aoun maintains his siege of illegal ports 
south of beirut run by moslem militias 
aouns blockade in a move aimed at restoring government control 
long eroded by the powerful militias led to the latest round of 
fighting in lebanons 14year civil war 
since march 8 at least 270 people mainly civilians have been 
killed and nearly 1000 wounded 
about 150000 moslems have fled beirut many out of fear of 
renewed fighting others have left because of shortages of flour 
and fuel power blackouts and the breakdown of the water system 
but many moslem men have stayed to look after homes and 
businesses 
im prepared to live in an underground shelter for the rest of 
my life but i wont leave my shop or apartment to be looted 
said izzat salam a sunni moslem spare parts dealer who has sent 
his family to damascus the syrian capital 
police reported numerous complaints about robberies in 
bombdamaged apartments shops and warehouses 
meanwhile about 400 christians demonstrated in the jdaideh 
suburb of east beirut to support aouns war of liberation to 
force syria to withdraw its 40000 troops in lebanon 
a spokesman for the demonstrators who refused to be identified 
said they planned to stage a sitin near the us embassy in east 
beirut to demand us action to save lebanon and rid it of the 
syrian occupation 
lebanese guards outside the embassy fired in the air on thursday 
to stop demonstrators jumping over a barbed wire fence to get into 
the us compound police said 
the spokesman said six demonstrators fell on the barbed wire 
fence and suffered injuries 
aoun accused washington of failing to mobilize western pressure 
on syria to stop the fighting us officials have said washington 
has little influence with the syrians 
in geneva un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar today 
called on all countries to provide humanitarian asssistance to 
lebanon and said immediate needs totaled 92 million

neighboring angola after april 1 in violation of a december peace 
accord that required them to remain at bases in angola until 
midmay

rocks in at least three cities today after rallies demanding the 
overthrow of president roh taewoo 
several thousand radical students took part in fierce clashes at 
four major colleges in seoul surging out of the campuses to attack 
riot police who fired volleys of tear gas and hurled rocks back at 
the protesters 
punish roh taewoo and yankee go home the students 
yelled as they beat drums and brass gongs in the third day of 
serious campus protests in seoul and other cities 
yonhap the south korean news agency said hundreds of students 
also clashed with police in the southeastern cities of kwangju and 
iri 
police officials said there had been some injuries but they had 
no figures on injuries or arrests 
the defense ministry announced earlier today it would mobilize 
up to 80000 military technicians to keep key industries running if 
workers go on strike the government has warned that growing labor 
unrest could cause major economic damage and foment unrest 
students staged protests at colleges in seoul to support labor 
strikes and demand the overthrow of the conservative roh 
government student leaders called for a major drive by opposition 
groups to oust roh 
more than 1000 students hurling hundreds of firebombs and rocks 
battled riot police for more than two hours in the streets around 
konkuk university in eastern seoul police trucks with multiple 
tear gas launchers repeatedly fired barrages of choking gas to 
drive the protesters back onto the campus 
police battled about 1000 students at hankook university who 
charged out wielding iron pipes and wooden clubs and hurling 
firebombs similar clashes were reported by college officials at 
seoul national and yonsei universities 
the students claim the roh government is a front for military 
rule and are calling for a popular uprising to topple the 
administration but the radicals and allied dissident groups lack 
popular support because of their violence and extreme views 
the students are not seen as a serious threat to the government 
even though they have been staging almost daily violent protests 
roh and other government leaders are worried about the radicals 
efforts to build an alliance with militant trade unions that have 
been staging strikes for higher pay and better working conditions 
the government says strikes in recent months have cost the economy 
2 billion in lost production 
the defense ministry statement today said it would use military 
engineers and other technicians to keep vital industries running if 
hit by strikes the government said earlier this week that it would 
use troops to keep important industries operating

mark zell from alon shvut settlement a lawyer who immigrated to 
israel from washington

school officials across the country are being 
advised to test for radon after the federal government found 
unhealthy levels of the odorless cancercausing gas in half the 
schools examined in spot checks from maine to washington state 
based on measurements taken in 3000 schoolrooms in 16 states 
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in 
schools throughout the united states epa administrator william 
k reilly said thursday 
he called indoor radon which is emitted from natural 
radioactive decay in the ground one of the major environmental 
health threats facing americans and urged that officials 
nationwide test their schoolrooms for the gas 
the testing he said today on cbs this morning would cost 
anywhere from 5 to 25 for a room and if it turns out theres a 
problem the costs of doing something about it are not very high 
theyre in the range of 500 to 10000 maximum 
the epa which last year issued a similar warning to homeowners 
after a spot check around the country said that of 130 public 
schools tested in 41 communities 54 percent of the schools had at 
least one room normally occupied by students or staff that 
registered unhealthy levels of radon 
the agency has said that any level of 4 picocuries per liter of 
air should be considered unhealthy and warrant additional tests and 
likely corrective action in schools in five of the states the 
level was 20 picocuries or more and in a school in tennessee it was 
found to be 136 picocuries 
by comparison federal standards for uranium mining call for 
miners to wear protective equipment when radiation levels are 16 to 
20 picocuries per liter of air during continuous work periods said 
richard guimond the epas director of radiation programs 
epa spokeswoman martha casey said no list of the schools tested 
was immediately available but affected state authorities and 
school officials in the 41 communities have been told of the test 
results 
in california state health services director kenneth kizer said 
the national advisory is based on weak scientific evidence and will 
result in unfounded fears will further erode confidence in 
government and waste money 
there is no federal law requiring tests for radon although 
congress enacted a law last year requiring the epa to study the 
extent of radon contamination in schools congress has yet to 
provide the 15 million for the program however said sen john 
chafee rri a sponsor of the legislation 
these very preliminary findings show that radon may be a more 
serious health problem in our schools than we originally thought 
that it may be as serious as asbestos or lead in drinking water 
said sen quentin burdick dnd chairman of the senate 
environment and public works committee 
the epa estimates that over a lifetime regular exposure to 4 
picocuries of radon is equivalent to smoking a half pack of 
cigarettes a day scientists have estimated that radon may cause up 
to 20000 lung cancer deaths a year second only to fatalities 
caused by smoking 
actual exposure of children to radon in schools is difficult to 
determine from the incomplete epa tests since levels can range 
widely from school to school and even among rooms in the same 
school according to agency officials 
guimond estimated in an interview that from the data obtained 
from the tests in the 130 schools it is likely that students in as 
many as 10 percent of the nations schools could be exposed to 
unhealthy radon levels on a regular basis 
of the 3000 schoolrooms tested 19 percent had levels of 4 
picocuries or more about 3 percent or 101 classrooms in six 
states had levels of at least 20 picocuries including 77 
schoolrooms in nashville enn area where the highest level 136 
picocuries also was found 
especially high levels also were found in schools in butte 
mont 51 picocuries los alamos nm 41 picocuries and the 
spokane wash area 98 picocuries according to the epa 
guimond said such levels are not that unique at schools 
located in areas where significant radon is present in the ground 
and where ventilation systems often suck radon into buildings 
when these two things occur youre going to get those high 
levels he said 
the other states in which schools were tested were nevada 
wyoming colorado north dakota kansas minnesota missouri 
illinois indiana georgia and new jersey 
according to the agency unhealthy radon levels also have been 
found in previous tests in schools in virginia florida maryland 
pennsylvania new york ohio and iowa those findings were not 
part of the latest study and no additional information was 
available 
radon which is colorless odorless and tasteless is the 
product of the natural radioactive decay of radium226 in the soil 
and rocks it normally poses no health concerns outdoors where 
typical levels are in the 02 to 07 picocurie range the higher 
concentrations occur in buildings where the gas is trapped and 
accumulates

the last participant in a 
hunger strike has resumed eating ending a protest that helped win 
freedom for hundreds of black inmates who were held without charge 
a human rights group said today 
the human rights commission said the last known hunger striker 
zelile zwane began eating thursday after being taken to court and 
charged with various offenses including illegal weapons possession 
and attempted murder 
like the other hunger strikers many of them antiapartheid 
activists held since 1986 he had demanded the government either 
release him or charge him 
the government said this week that less than 100 people remained 
in custody under emergency regulations allowing indefinite 
detention without trial about 1000 were held in late january 
when hundreds of detainees began fasting in prisons across the 
country 
we see what happened as a great victory for detainees said 
audrey coleman a member of the human rights commission through 
their united action they were able to expose the whole system of 
detention without trial 
however the commission and civil rights lawyers issued angry 
protests today because of reports that former hunger strikers had 
been shackled to their beds while recuperating at johannesburg 
hospital 
the national medical and dental association an organization of 
antiapartheid health care professionals said thursday that at 
least two detainees had been shackled to prevent escapes since 
september there have been at least four escapes from hospitals by 
detainees receiving treatment 
police headquarters declined comment on the use of shackles at 
the hospital but said departmental policy allowed such measures 
the human rights commission says a majority of detainees freed 
in recent weeks have been issued with restriction orders many of 
them are barred from certain political activities confined to 
their homes at night and required to report to a police station 
twice daily 
one former detainee chris ntuli was killed by unidentified 
assailants last week after making his required appearance at a 
police station in a black shantytown outside durban civil rights 
groups suggested the killers were rightwing vigilantes who were 
able to predict ntulis movements because of the restrictions 
black activists in the durban area today called for residents to 
stay away from work and school in conjunction with a memorial 
service for ntuli there were unconfirmed reports that two buses 
were firebombed and that a milk truck was set on fire killing the 
driver 
the weekly mail a leading antiapartheid newspaper reported 
today that the decision to free most detainees was made by the 
cabinet against the wishes of the state security council which 
includes senior military and intelligence officials as well as a 
few cabinet ministers 
the weekly mail quoted mark swilling a johannesburgbased 
political scientist as saying it was the first time the security 
council was overruled in the 11 years since president pw botha 
took power

two american labor leaders said today that soviet 
officials admitted their trade unions have not adequately protected 
workers but ruled out formation of independent trade organizations 
however the leaders aflcio vice presidents jack sheinkman and 
william winpisinger told a news conference they believe such 
independent unions like polands solidarity might surface 
if steps are not taken to adequately reflect representation 
and problems that the workers are putting to their leadership that 
kind of pressure might ultimately explode sheinkman said he is 
president of the new yorkbased amalgamated clothing and textile 
workers union 
one of the tenets of communism is that workers rights are a top 
priority of the government but trade unions have come under 
increasing criticism for not aggressively prodding bureaucrats to 
improve housing salaries and working conditions 
at least two strikes by soviet miners have been reported this 
year over low salaries and poor working conditions 
sheinkman said he asked stepan a shalayev president of the 
allunion central council of trade unions on monday whether 
independent trade unions would be created in the soviet union 
this was not what they felt was necessary pluralism as 
defined by him in our conversations meant pluralism within the 
existing system and framework and not in terms of an independent 
union such as exists in poland the american labor chief said 
but he said president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms could lead 
to such unions because the government will not be able to put the 
necessary checks on everything 
earlier this month polands government ended seven years of 
suppression and legalized the trade union solidarity 
winpisinger president of the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers said he believes gorbachev whom 
he met wednesday is aware of the faults of soviet trade unions 
gennady yanayev a secretary of the soviet trade unioncouncil 
told the news conference that officially backed trade unions have 
not paid enough attention to the social and economic needs of 
workers but that improvements are under way 
we are confident the unions will be made an even more dynamic 
and efficient force and given that i think there will be no 
question of the need for alternative groups yanayev said 
but he added life will show

seventeen roman catholic churches that have been 
ordered closed filed grievances with the archdiocese of detroit 
charging that church officials decision to shut down 30 innercity 
churches was racist 
the grievances filed thursday call for an independent church 
review of the closings announced by cardinal edmund szoka in 
january after five years study the churches were ordered to close 
by june 30 because of dwindling membership and the expense of 
maintaining obsolete buildings 
three churches that arent scheduled to close also filed 
grievances in sympathy for the others 
the grievances charge that szoka bishop patrick cooney and 
members of two committees that recommended the closings showed a 
lack of love for the citys black catholics 
they willingly accept the premise that white suburban 
catholics would not involve themselves in the church in the city 
for reasons of racism fear of crime and overall lack of love for 
their urban brothers and sisters the documents state 
the rev norman nawrocki the archdioceses grievance clerk has 
20 days to decide whether the grievances fit the archdioceses 
guidelines for disputes if they do they will be heard by a 
grievance committee that can make a recommendation to the cardinal 
said jay berman a spokesman for the archdiocese 
berman who called the charges in the grievances harsh and 
very unfair said however that only the cardinal can overturn his 
own decisions about the churches 
berman also said there could be an appeal directly to the 
vatican but most of the parishes filed that appeal earlier before 
filing this one and to his knowledge there has been no response

said tom hanscom spokesman for the san diego wild animal park the 
bird hatched wednesday is the second california condor to be 
conceived and produced in captivity and the 29th known member of 
the critically endangered species

chick named mandan time to rest and build an appetite while being 
monitored by keepers for signs of a working digestive system 
it gobbled it down it did so well with the first feeding that 
it took two minced mice about an hour later hanscom said the 
chick is alert and active and gives every appearance of a healthy 
baby condor

house speaker jim wright says the house ethics 
committee and its chief investigator are dragging their feet in 
granting wright an opportunity to defend himself personally against 
69 alleged rues violations 
the ethics panel meanwhile is investigating yet another 
investment deal that yielded huge profits for wright and could 
yield new ethics headaches as well 
committee members will travel to texas next week to interview 
businessmen who helped wrights investment partnership parlay a 
9120 investment into a 440000 return in a short period last 
year 
published reports on thursday indicated the businessmen has an 
interest in selling jet trainers to the air force a key question 
before the ethics committee is whether wright received favors from 
people with a direct interest in legislation 
wright said thursday he has met requirements to move to the next 
phase of his case a chance for him to confront the ethics 
committee and seek to rebut the allegations of failure to report 
gifts accepting gifts from someone with an interest in legislation 
and evading outside income limits through bulk sales of a book he 
wrote 
he particularly blamed the committees special outside counsel 
richard j phelan for what he termed the delay im puzzled as 
to why he is dragging his feet wright told a reporter were 
very anxious to have the matter resolved as soon as possible 
and he added its a little bit distracting that i write 
letters to the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
committee and get a reply from mr phelan and its always some 
foot dragging im anxious to let them ask me questions 
poll results published today indicated americans strongly 
believe wright should step down as speaker if the house ultimately 
finds him guilty of rules violations a wall street journalnbc 
news poll of 1447 adults last weekend found 75 percent holding 
that view while just 8 percent said he should not resign 
an abc news poll broadcast thursday night found that while many 
americans are unaware of the wright case or dont have enough 
information to judge whether the charges are true 21 percent 
believe he should quit immediately and 59 percent say he should 
resign if the charges are proven the survey questioned 540 people 
on wednesday 
a wright supporter rep charles wilson dtexas accused phelan 
of trying to let the speaker twist as long as possible and be 
battered by the news media 
a la john tower the prosecutor figures as long as he can 
delay its worse for the accused wilson said after a meeting 
with wright and aides to plan political strategy 
wrights chief accuser rep newt gingrich rga said pressure 
is bilding on house leaders to urge the speaker to step down soon 
from his highvisibility post 
i would be very surprised if the senior members of the 
democratic leadership dont try to talk the speaker into stepping 
down before going through the agony of a public defense public 
cross examination gingrich the house republican whip said at a 
luncheon with reporters 
since mondays ethics committee announcement the equivalent of 
an indictment on charges of violating house rules there has been 
a series of negotiations between phelan and wrights lawyer 
william c oldaker and a flurry of letters between the speakers 
office and that of the committee 
under the panels rules the filing of charges must be followed 
by a formal admission or denial of each charge by wright then by a 
period in which the committee reviews the evidence and decides what 
charges if any to make the subject of a disciplinary hearing 
in a letter tuesday wright made a formal blanket denial of all 
the charges but while asking for an expedited hearing before the 
ethics committee he also did not address certain requirements of 
the panels rules 
committee members said it appeared wright was seeking to jump 
ahead to a disciplinary hearing in which only his side would be 
heard 
you cant say lets forget all the evidence ill just go 
before the jury and make my case said rep thomas petri 
rwis a member of the ethics panel he cant waive our 
presentation of the facts and evidence phelan has an obligation to 
present evidence to the full committee and give wright a chance to 
question it and offer his own witnesses 
meanwhile two panel members were scheduled to go to texas early 
next week as part of the committees continuing investigation into 
an oil well deal called the sabine lake prospect mallightco the 
investment company owned by wright and his business partner george 
mallick bought a 4 percent interest in the well for an initial 
payment of 9120 on may 10 1988 
despite what the ethics committee described as a pessimistic 
outlook for the well that interest was sold on the same day to 
union rheinische petroleum inc for 440000 less mallightcos 
90000 share of drilling costs wright has denied any knowledge of 
the investment noting that his interest in mallightco was at that 
time in a blind trust 
the los angeles times and the new york times reported thursday 
that there are close links between union rheinische and jaffe 
energy corp the company which arranged the sale of mallightcos 
interest for a huge profit a related company jaffe aerospace 
corp has been courting the air force in an effort to sell a new 
basic trainer aircraft to replace the aging t37 the newspapers

lech walesa leader of solidarity and champion of 
polands new political course told italian political leaders today 
that his country needs investment rather than aid 
poland has all the figures to be part of of europe but it 
needs investments more than aid investments to create companies 
and a market the polish labor leader told premier ciriaco de 
mita 
walesa traveled to italy just days after polands communist 
government restored the legality of the solidarity labor movement 
and agreed to free elections for a new house of parliament 
the labor leader who played a key role in negotiations leading 
to the reforms met with pope john paul ii on thursday to receive 
his blessing for polands new reforms 
walesa drummed home his plea for investments in talks today with 
president francesco cossiga foreign minister giulio andreotti 
socialist party leader bettino craxi and rome mayor pietro giubilo 
in a 35minute meeting with the premier walesa said solidarity 
intended to fight economic centralism and work for political 
economic and social pluralism foreign investment would play a key 
role in helping poles reach those goals he said 
there is everything to be done in our country and therefore 
cooperation can also be good business said the labor leader 
winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize 
walesa also emphasized that poland wants to be integrated into 
europe and not shut out when european community countries form an 
internal market without borders in 1992 
we poles count on you heavily in constructing the new 
poland he told andreotti according to a translation from the 
foreign ministry i think that we can together build a single 
europe and you can be our teachers 
de mita and andreotti assured walesa that italy would encourage 
investment in poland and support economic and political change in 
the country 
the european community in its entirety must look at the 
east starting from the primary locomotive of its economic force 
which ought to move toward the east consolidating the dialogue of 
peace in the economiccommercial area said craxi who was 
italys prime minister from 198387 
a europe that closes up within itself and doesnt know how to 
look to the south and to the east is a myopic and egoistic 
europe he added 
the situation in poland is of keen interest in italy which has 
a strong union tradition and is overwhelmingly roman catholic 
polands government imposed martial law in december 1981 to 
crush solidarity the soviet blocs first independent trade union 
with the legalization of solidarity the communist government is 
hoping to win the union movements support in reviving the economy 
and encourage new aid from the west 
the catholic church extremely influential in poland took part 
in the negotiations with the government that produced the reforms

a program that earmarks 10 percent of 
city and school board contracts for minorities and women has been 
halted pending trial by a federal judge 
the preliminary injunction issued thursday by us district 
judge john h moore ii takes the place of a temporary restraining 
order that shut down the programs april 6 the future of the 
setaside program challenged as unconstitutional by nonminority 
contractors will be decided at a trial in december 
about 14 million is earmarked each year by the city and school 
board for companies owned and operated by minorities and women 
the court finds that the public interest is served by ensuring 
that the legislative bodies programs conform to the provisions of 
the united states constitution moore said in his ruling 
moore cited a us supreme court ruling in january that declared 
minority setaside programs unconstitutional unless they are based 
on a detailed study showing the minorities have faced governmental 
discriminination in the past 
neither the city nor the school board has conducted a study on 
the 10 percent setaside programs started in 1984 a study is 
scheduled to be conducted soon officials said 
officials with the northeast florida chapter of associated 
general contractors and barcorp which filed the suit challenging 
the setasides said their rights were being violated because they 
could not bid on some of the city and school board projects 
blacks in this city of 550000 claim the ruling means they will 
be shut out of contracts 
its going to put us back in the same predicament as five 
years ago said ernest mcduffie iii a contractor who has 
received work under the program a lot of people will go out of 
business and people wont have work

the authors of a highly publicized report on 
roomtemperature nuclear fusion have decided not to publish it in a 
prestigious british scientific journal the editors announced 
thursday 
b stanley pons of the university of utah and martin fleischmann 
of britains university of southampton had said publicly that they 
submitted the paper to nature magazine an editorial in thursdays 
issue noted 
following standard practice editors referred the paper to other 
scientists for review these referees raised several questions that 
would require pons and fleischmann to do more work on the paper 
nature said 
but fleischmann and pons have taken the view that they could 
not at the same time satisfy the referees and get on with other 
urgent work nature said 
so their paper will not be published but a second cold fusion 
paper from a team including brigham young university scientist 
steven jones will appear in next thursdays issue nature said 
jones and colleagues did make changes requested by referees nature 
said 
pam fogle a university of utah spokeswoman said nature 
specifically asked for more data and to flesh out the article by 
some 1000 to 2000 words some of the data they were asking for 
was coming out of experiments that are currently operating they 
didnt have the data to supply to the reviewers for the second 
goround 
fleischmann and pons already have reported their work in the 
journal of electroanalytical chemistry nature noted 
nature said that the absence of their article should not be 
taken to imply that their research is inherently less believable 
than the work by jones and colleagues 
nor does the appearance of jones paper mean that all those 
who have seen it are persuaded to its chief conclusion the 
editorial said it just means that the authors have produced an 
article which answers questions that would otherwise spring to 
readers minds it said 
both teams of researchers say they have produced nuclear fusion 
at room temperature in contrast to the extreme heat used in 
standard fusion experients 
fusion powers the sun and stars and scientists say it may 
provide an environmentally benign source of energy if it can be 
harnessed

who were plotting to overthrow the government of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani announced during a weekly 
prayer session at tehran university that a large number of the 
spies have been arrested in recent weeks according to irans 
official islamic republic news agency reported monitored in 
nicosia 
he claimed the arrests have exposed the entire cia operation in 
the middle east rafsanjani said the americans should have 
realized that this country is no place for coups 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
he had no information on the spy allegations 
my information is we dont really know what theyre talking 
about they make similar claims every once in a while about 
american spies when they need a little attention fitzwater said 
rafsanjani said some of the spies were iranian navy personnel 
who transmitted intelligence on iranian naval deployments to the 
us navy when they were fighting us in the persian gulf 
he said the iranian ship iran ajr which was attacked and 
boarded by us forces in the gulf on sept 21 1987 as it was 
laying mines was betrayed by these very people 
rafsanjani said the arrests included big american spies who 
were now being interrogated he did not say how many people were 
rounded up because the americans should not know how many have 
been trapped there are too many but he stressed that the navy 
officers who had allegedly spied for the americans are 
fortunately still alive 
he claimed the americans have announced these people have been 
executed because they are not aware of their whereabouts 
rafsanjani did not name the navy men but dissident iranian 
sources reported recently that three senior navy officers were 
executed in early april for plotting to overthrow the government 
they were identified as adm kianoosh hakimi commander of naval 
communications and joint operations with the air force adm 
ghahreman malezzadeh naval representative at the chief of staffs 
office and adm farhad riahi commander of the airborne units 
the sources said that about 20 other prowestern navy officers 
had been arrested on charges of spying 
the iranian news agency said the thousands of shiite moslem 
worshipers around the campus in downtown tehran chanted american 
spies must be executed rafsanjani vowed that gods decree will 
be carried out and that the alleged spies would be punished 
he did not elaborate but iranian authorities have executed 
hundreds of political dissidents and alleged drug smugglers in 
recent months 
irans news agency said rafsanjani disclosed that numerous 
espionage dens and networks set up since the 1979 islamic 
revolution had been discovered in various places and sensitive 
parts of the country 
he added we have sustained losses from them during the war 
with iraq and in recent days 
rafsanjanis disclosure came amid a resurgence of radical 
fundamentalism in which hardliners led by interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi have gained control of the tehran hierarchy at the 
expense of socalled pragmatists like rafsanjani 
the disclosure appeared to be designed to stir antiwestern 
sentiment at a time when iran is gripped by political uncertainty 
and serious economic difficulties in the postwar period 
the alleged discovery of us spy cells comes amid a reportedly 
widespread purge in the armed forces and other power centers in 
iran as the hardliners gained strength after khomeinis drive to 
rekindle revolutionary fervor

maverick attorney mark lane today confirmed he 
is interested in representing presidential assailant john w 
hinckley jr but denied suggestions he wants to write a book about 
the man who shot president reagan 
lane who made a national reputation for his writings on 
assassination conspiracy theories insisted that hinckleys 
interest in retaining him was based solely on a desire for 
effective legal counsel rather than to collaborate on a book 
he said it appears that mr hinckley seems more settled more 
concerned about constitutional rights and more accurate and less 
emotionally disturbed than are his keepers at a local mental 
institution where hinckley has been held since his 1982 acquittal 
by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of reagan and three 
others 
lane who said he has spoken with hinckley several times by 
telephone since hinckley called him in early march also dismissed 
suggestions that he would seek payment of his legal fees in 
revenues from a book on the case 
i have never made any agreement with any client in which my 
fee was paid by the publication of a book lane said in a 
telephone interview from daytona beach fla where he is 
representing a man on death row i never have because i believe 
that generally constitutes a conflict of interest 
lane commented in response to testimony thursday in federal 
court in which hinckley said he wanted to hire lane because he 
has done very well defending famous criminals 
he has taken some cases of national reknown hinckley 
said in his first testimony choosing the last word after a long 
careful pause 
he has represented some people who are famous to the general 
public hinckley told prosecutor robert r chapman these clients 
gained notoriety as criminals in the criminal world 
hinckley won permission at thursdays hearing to meet with lane 
or other lawyers at the mental hospital 
hinckley who initially did not identify the lawyerauthor by 
name told us district judge june l green that he telephoned 
lane because he had somewhat of a reputation 
what kind of reputation the judge said 
he is just known nationwide in certain circles i had heard of 
him in the past representing a number of people 
he has certainly had many cases and done well with them 
explained hinckley who wore a navy blazer over an openneck plaid 
sports shirt 
hospital lawyer janet l maher contended that hinckley would 
expose himself to exploitation if allowed to interview prospective 
attorneys without court supervision 
are you aware that in fact he has written a number of books 
about political assassinations she asked hinckley 
i know of one book he has written hinckley replied 
what book is that the judge interjected 
do you want me to just give this persons name because we are 
going to lead into that hinckley said 
after the judge indicated she did hinckley said he has 
written a book called rush to judgment his name is mark lane 
hospital authorities canceled his appointment with lane 
hinckley said 
i should at least be permitted to talk to the man hinckley 
said if we dont get along it stops right there 
in his 1966 book rush to judgment lane disputed the 
findings of the warren commission that lee harvey oswald alone shot 
and killed president kennedy in 1963 in dallas 
hinckley also acknowledged that he knew that at one time lane 
had represented james earl ray who killed the rev martin luther 
king jr 
asked if he knew that lane had also written other books about 
people he represented hinckley said i dont think its a crime 
that hes written these books and interviewed these people i am 
sure that the subjects he has written about at some point gave 
their consent 
i am capable of deciding whether i want my story told and it 
is not the hospitals say to dictate whether i can do that said 
hinckley who spoke lucidly and appeared relaxed on the witness 
stand 
vincent j fuller the lawyer who successfully defended hinckley 
at the 1982 trial did not oppose the motion for a new lawyer 
fuller said he was relieved to be dismissed from the case 
he wanted new counsel hes entitled to it i did not want to 
stand in his way fuller said as he left the courthouse 
a psychiatrist at st elizabeths hospital here testified that 
hinckley was competent to pick a new lawyer but had been placed in 
a maximumsecurity ward because he had difficulty handling the 
privileges he had previously been given 
dr raymond patterson said hinckley still suffers from a serious 
mental illness continues to have difficulty in his judgment 
and has difficulty learning from his past experience 
he cant differentiate famous from infamous patterson said 
he does not have a clear perception of how he is seen by others 
in 1987 hinckley was living in a dormitorystyle room when 
federal prosecutors turned up evidence he was corresponding with 
serial killer ted bundy who was executed last year 
that revelation and others prompted the hospital to drop its 
attempt to give hinckley an easter weekend pass that year to visit 
his family 
plans to take him on an outing with other patients last summer 
were abandoned after authorities discovered a new cache of letters 
which remain under court seal 
the flair for writing that hinckley has shown in several 
articles he has written has prompted widespread speculation that he 
wants to write a book about his life 
sources who have spoke on condition of anonymity say that among 
the papers seized from his possession was a wellwritten manuscript

police have launched a nationwide 
manhunt for a nazi war criminal convicted of murdering auschwitz 
prisoners during sadistic target practice exercises officials said 
today 
in a statement to the news media the wuppertal prosecutors 
office said former nazi ss sgt gottfried weise 69 is believed 
to have fled his home to avoid arrest wuppertal is 15 miles east 
of duesseldorf 
weise was convicted jan 28 1988 of killing at least five 
prisoners in 1944 at the nazis notorious auschwitz concentration 
camp in what is now poland he worked at the camp as a guard during 
world war ii 
during his 15month trial weise became know as the william 
tell of auschwitz after witnesses testified he killed an 
8yearold boy and a 17yearold girl by forcing them to balance 
tin cans on their heads which he then used for target practice 
in addition to their deaths weise was found guilty of shooting 
to death two male prisoners who tried to escape by hiding in a 
supply truck and another man who did not report quickly enough for 
roll call 
weise was sentenced to life imprisonment but was allowed to 
remain free pending an appeal 
horst rosenbaum the wuppertal chief prosecutor told reporters 
police went to weises home in nearby solingen on thursday after 
word was received that a federal court had turned down the 
conviction appeal 
he said weise was not home and apparently had fled to avoid 
arrest 
we assume that he is on the run and a nationwide search for 
weise has been started all border crossing points have been 
notified rosenbaum said 
he added that the search would expand outside west germany if 
evidence is received indicating weise may be in a foreign country 
according to the prosecutor weise was not jailed pending the 
outcome of the appeal because the court decided with his 
retirement pension and home here there was little danger of him 
fleeing

suspected communist rebels firing 
from a speeding car killed a us army officer and former vietnam 
prisoner of war today as he headed to work officials said 
col james n rowe 51 of mcallen texas was shot in the head 
when at least two hooded assailants pulled up in an auto alongside 
rowes car and shot him near his office at a military compound in 
suburban quezon city the officials said 
col victor tiangco of the philippine militarys capital region 
command said rowes driver joaquin vinuya was wounded in the 7 
am ambush but was not seriously injured 
tiangco said rowe a west point graduate was chief of the army 
division at the joint us military advisory group which provides 
training and logistical support for the philippine armed forces 
president corazon aquino said the philippine military would 
increase security around the six us military installations in the 
wake of the attack 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called the 
killing a cowardly and heinous act 
we will work closely with the philippine government in their 
efforts to track down and bring to justice those responsible for 
this assassination the us governments support for philippine 
democracy is unshaken fitzwater said 
rowe was held prisoner in a cage in the jungles of vietnam by 
the viet cong from october 1963 until he escaped on new years eve 
1968 he wrote a book about the ordeal titled five years to 
freedom 
after five years i was out of the forest of darkness rowe 
recalled after he gained his freedom i could see the horizon and 
the world seemed immense 
police said a driver and at least two gunmen were in the 
assailants car one had an m16 rifle and another a 45caliber 
pistol they said 
toto austria a cashier at a gasoline station said he heard 
shots and turned to see a white car pull alongside rowes 
silvergray vehicle 
as the cars turned along a traffic circle austria said he saw 
at least one man fire from a window he said there was more gunfire 
before the assailants made a uturn and sped away 
police later found the assailants car about 1 miles west of 
the ambush site which was three blocks from the military compound 
tiangco said 21 bullets struck rowes car 
a us embassy spokesman jerry huchel said rowe was dead on 
arrival at a philippine military hospital and that his body was 
flown to clark air base 50 miles north of manila 
no group claimed responsibility for the slaying but defense 
secretary fidel ramos and other officials said they believed 
communist rebels were responsible because of the weapons used and 
the style of the attack 
on the face of it it is likely that this was perpetrated by 
communist terrorists ramos said 
us ambassador nicholas platt said if anyone thinks that 
killing this brave officer would alter in any way us policy of 
support for philippine democracy they are wrong 
in alexandria va f andy messing jr executive director of 
the national defense council foundation said rowe had expressed 
concern about rebel terrorism during a meeting last month in manila 
he had an idea that it was going to occur messing said 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
said the killing highlighted the seriousness of the marxist 
insurgency 
they rebels are operating not only in the mountains and 
villages but openly here in metro manila so i keep saying that 
it is wrong for us to keep maintaining that everything is fine we 
are winning the war maceda said 
in october 1987 communist rebels killed three americans and a 
filipino of american descent in simultaneous attacks near clark air 
base 
on april 9 rebels blasted a us military communications 
station in benguet province of northern luzon island no one was 
injured but us officials asked that security around american 
installations be tightened 
the rebels have threatened more attacks against americans 
because of american interference in the 20year insurgency 
rowe is survived by a wife and two young children

many americans are unfamiliar with the ethics 
charges against house speaker jim wright but majorities say he 
should resign as speaker if he violated the rules of congress two 
national polls have found 
a fifth of the respondents in an abc news poll said wright 
should quit as speaker immediately and an additional 59 percent 
said he should resign his leadership position if the charges 
against him were found to be true 
in an nbc newswall street journal survey 75 percent said 
wright should quit as speaker if the house found that he broke its 
rules that poll did not ask if wright should resign immediately 
the abc poll found wrights popularity declining in an april 3 
poll 53 percent approved of his performance as speaker in the 
poll done wednesday two days after the ethics committee charged 
wright 29 percent approved 
about half those who no longer approved of wright said they 
disapproved of him the other half were undecided 
in the nbcjournal poll about one quarter of the respondents 
had a favorable opinion of wright and about a quarter had an 
unfavorable opinion the rest nearly half had no opinion of him 
both polls found another indication that the issue has not 
gripped public attention nearly half in the nbcjournal poll and 
40 percent in the abc poll said they had not heard or read anything 
about the wright affair 
nbc and the journal polled 1447 adults sunday through tuesday 
and their poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points abc polled 540 adults wednesday night its survey had a 
5point margin of error 
poll results can vary because of the wording of questions and 
because of changing events that prompt movements in public opinion 
the ethics committee charged wright on monday while the 
nbcjournal poll was being conducted 
wright was cited monday for 69 violations of house rules 
including allegations he improperly accepted nearly 145000 in 
gifts and that his wife was paid 72000 for work she didnt do 
he has denied charges he violated any house rules including the 
alleged use of book sales to avoid a limit on fees for speeches

the viet cong kept james n rowe in a cage in the jungle of 
vietnam for five years but they couldnt break his spirit with a 
constant barrage of propaganda and almost daily death threats 
instead it was hooded gunmen in the philippines who took the 
life of the 51yearold army colonel he was shot to death friday 
as he drove to work at the joint us military advisory group 
headquarters no group immediately claimed responsiblity but 
investigators believed the killers were communist rebels 
rowe who was decorated for his vietnamese ordeal escaped from 
his cage on new years eve 1968 he was nearly killed by us 
forces who thought the blackpajamaclad special forces officer was 
a viet cong 
he came home to texas rio grande valley to a heros welcome 
rowe a native of mcallen graduated from west point in 1960 
and was captured by the viet cong oct 29 1963 
after he managed to escape rowe sighted a us cobra helicopter 
and ran into a clearing signaling for help 
the first impulse of the men in the helicopter was to shoot the 
man because he was dressed like the viet cong but army maj dave 
thompson ordered the men not to shoot because he wanted to take him 
prisoner 
in his book five years to freedom rowe recalled that he 
jumped into the helicopter and began trying to tell them who he was 
after five years i was out of the forest of darkness rowe 
recalled i could see the horizon and the world seemed immense 
rowe was taken to brooke army medical center in san antonio for 
a medical examination and treatment and then was allowed to fly 
home 
as the helicopter approached mcallen rowe wrote i was 
totally absorbed with my thoughts as i watched the towns pass 
below bringing me miles closer to my home it had been such a 
long long journey both in time and space 
at his parents home it was an emotional scene as the young 
officer dashed from the car to the front porch where his father 
lee rowe opened the door 
dad dad im sorry i didnt get home sooner they just 
wouldnt let me go he said 
rowe earlier had told reporters he had asked his mother 
florence to bake some bread for his first meal at home 
rowe hugged his parents describing it as five long years 
worth of hugging 
the three of us stood for a long moment touching 
communicating without speaking rowe recalled my world was 
complete i had reached out and touched the light 
a few weeks later rowe made a speech at mcallen high schools 
football stadium and a parade was held thousands turned out for a 
glimpse of the hometown hero 
lee rowe died in 1973 and mrs rowe died in 1982 
john ford one of rowes cousins remembered rowe as a brave man 
who knew what he was getting into when he was sent to vietnam 
he knew it was a hot spot when he went over there he knew he 
had to be careful ford said friday from his mcallen home 
he walked like an army officer he talked like one and he died 
like one

thousands of childrens books have gone up 
in flames in this northern illinois community and authorities are 
trying to determine who is behind firebomb attacks on the public 
library and two schools 
the third and latest incident was the firebombing of the joliet 
public library on wednesday night childrens librarian dianne 
harmon said today that damage estimates to the books and historic 
building ranged from 800000 to 15 million 
ive been here 31 years and ive never seen anyone burning 
for books fire chief george plese said thursday ive seen 
them burn for money burn for spite burn for all kinds of reasons 
but never for books 
no one has been injured in the three firebomb attacks which 
have been started with the same kind of incendiary device at about 
the same time of day said officials in this community of 75000 
about 35 miles southwest of chicago 
on feb 10 a bottle filled with a fire accelerant was thrown 
into a bookstorage room at hufford junior high school causing 
damage estimated at 15000 
on monday a molotov cocktail was thrown through a window into a 
book storage room at marycrest elementary school causing at least 
10000 in damage and closing the school for a day 
and sometime after 9 pm wednesday an incendiary device of some 
type believed to be a molotov cocktail was hurled through a 
window at the public library plese said 
despite the similarities police said they are not making any 
assumptions about whether the firebombings are connected 
librarian james johnston choked back tears as he surveyed the 
damage from the fire 
i went through my professional calm and i am going through my 
combat rage said johnston a korean war veteran 
the childrens books section took the brunt of the damage but 
smoke damage was in evidence throughout the 86yearold limestone 
structure 
the childrens section of the library comprised about 48000 
books and harmon estimated that onequarter to onehalf of the 
collection could be salvaged johnston said roughly 60 percent of 
the books were out of print 
he said the citys insurance should cover most of the loss 
joliet officials the us treasury departments bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms and the state fire marshals office 
were investigating

a jury began deliberating the fate of oliver 
north today after one of the alternate jurors who sat through his 
criminal trial said of norths role in the irancontra affair he 
knew it was wrong 
no one said if you dont do this were going to fire you 
alternate juror horasina mckie told cbs news addressing one of the 
central points north used in his defense that all his actions 
were authorized by superiors 
ms mckie among the five alternates excused from the panel 
thursday said she thinks president reagan knew about norths 
activities 
i believe mr reagan knew what was going on she told cbs 
i cant say he knew everything but i think he knew enough to 
know what was going on i mean you see national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane every week hes only 100 yards from you or feet 
from you 
reagan told the tower commission on jan 26 1987 that he did 
not know that the national security council staff was engaged in 
helping the contra rebels in nicaragua 
during two hours of deliberations this morning the jury sent 
out requests to the judge for more copies of the jury instructions 
pencils writing paper and paper clips they also asked when lunch 
would be saying through an emissary that we want to get on a 
schedule lunch will be at noon each day 
ms mckies comments addressed a central point north has used in 
his defense 
the former white house aide testified that he had authorization 
for all his actions in the irancontra affair including allegedly 
obstructing congress by denying that he was assisting the 
nicaraguan contras 
mr north wasnt made to do what he did said ms mckie 
he had a choice in it he had a choice to either say no i dont 
want to do this or yes sir i will do this even as it went along 
and he knew it was wrong 
that remark addresses criminal intent a question that will be 
central to the jurys deliberations 
ms mckie said she would have voted to convict north on some 
charges acquit him on others but she emphasized she had not 
discussed the case with other jurors and thus could not say how 
they felt 
if convicted on all 12 counts against him north could face 
maximum prison terms totaling 60 years and fines of 3 million 
north testified that he had no idea any of his actions violated 
the law and that he had good motives for what he did 
he said he destroyed a ledger showing how he had spent 300000 
in cash on orders of cia director william casey because the 
document contained names of contras leaders and that exposure could 
have endangered their lives north is accused of illegally 
converting 4300 from the 300000 cash fund to his own use 
the jury foreman denise anderson 34 presides over a group of 
nine women and three men chosen for their task 2 months ago 
because they were among the few americans who hadnt watched read 
or heard anything substantial about norths televised testimony in 
1987 
ms anderson a hospital employee was picked for the jury after 
telling lawyers i dont like the news 
in two hours of instructions thursday the 12 jurors were told 
to consider only in a narrowly defined context norths assertion 
that all his actions were directed by higherups including 
president reagan 
authorization requires clear direct instructions to act at a 
given time in a given way said us district judge gerhard a 
gesell 
it must be specific not simply a general admonition or vague 
expression of preference 
gesell said neither the president nor norths bosses had 
the legal authority to order anyone to violate the law 
at the same time the judge encouraged the jury to consider the 
atmosphere of secrecy that pervaded the reagan administration in 
the irancontra affair 
emphasizing that our country is governed by the rule of law 
gesell said others ranking above or below north may have 
engaged in the same kind of conduct he did 
some have pled guilty to charges some await trial some are 
dead others have received immunity in exchange for testifying 
said the judge this evidence was admitted so you would better 
understand the atmosphere in which and the circumstances under 
which the defendant was working as these may bear on norths 
intent 
norths defense that his bosses gave him the goahead for 
everything he did could apply to as many as eight of the 12 
criminal charges against him however the judges instructions 
likely will curtail its importance in the jurors deliberations 
gesell emphasized a number of points that could be favorable to 
north 
the judge pointed out conflicting evidence over whether a 
proposed congressional resolution of inquiry was pending or not 
when north lied to the house intelligence committee in 1986 in the 
aug 6 1986 session north denied he was assisting the nicaraguan 
contra rebels one congressional committee had already voted down 
the resolution

moslems to participate in the ceremony and most take it as a 
binding duty 
residents and security forces said about 500 people hurled 
stones at police and demolished five police cars this afternoon in 
the city of salt 10 miles northwest of amman 
police said the city had been blocked off joining the southern 
towns of maan kerak mutah mazar and others 
residents of maan 120 miles south of amman and nearby cities 
said in telephone interviews that soldiers prevented prayer 
gatherings and ordered people to stay home 
relatives of communist party members said the government 
arrested as many as 100 party members overnight apparently in 
connection with the disturbances which have killed eight people 
since tuesday 
the protests marked the worst violence in jordan since the army 
crushed palestinian guerrillas in 197071 
the communists relatives told the associated press that 
intelligence officers raided the homes of party members in amman 
and the northern cities of irbid madaba zarqa and fuheis 
hours earlier the party had distributed a leaflet calling on 
the government to rescind prices rises that triggered the rioting 
the leaflet also demanded the government scrap an austerity 
program aimed at dealing with jordans economic problems which 
include a 6 billion foreign debt and 20 percent unemployment 
government officials as is common did not report the arrests 
rioting apparently spread to northern jordan for the first time 
thursday night 
a security official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
protesters in irbid burned trucks and tires and clashed with police 
thursday night irbid is 40 miles north of the capital 
mayor mahmoud alawneh of tayyba anothern northern town said 
1000 people protested there thursday night breaking windows in 
the school and town hall 
in madaba 20 miles south of amman windows were smashed in a 
bank and municipal building residents said 100 people demonstrated 
thursday night 
police manned trucks mounted with machine guns at key 
intersections in several towns today the moslem day of prayer when 
worshipers usually visit mosques troops also were deployed in 
amman which has been free of violence 
an official statement read over staterun jordan radio gave 
jordanians the first official details of the rioting to be reported 
internally 
it said police were trying to determine the persons and the 
sides behind all these pitiful incidents and to learn about their 
motives 
officials earlier had hinted that moslem fundamentalists might 
have encouraged the disturbances 
crown prince hassan younger brother of king hussein said in an 
interview with the british broadcasting corp on thursday that 
eight people had been killed and about 30 wounded in the rioting 
which broke out tuesday in maan and spread to other southern cities 
the region is noted for its support of hussein but incomes 
there are generally low 
the statement today said one policeman and four civilians died 
in maan it blamed the deaths on shooting by the rioters maan 
residents said the four civilians were killed by security forces 
they said rioters also fired guns 
the statement said the riots started when taxi drivers incited 
schoolchildren and citizens of maan to demonstrate over the price 
increase imposed sunday as part of an agreement with the 
international monetary fund to reschedule jordans debt 
many rioters have blamed prime minister zaid rifai for the 
austerity measures and demanded his ouster 
the measures include a 25 percent increase in the price of 
gasoline to 165 per gallon and increases of 10 percent to 50 
percent in the price of cigarettes cooking gas heating oil and 
other products living standards have fallen sharply over the past 
year and unemployment is nearly 20 percent

world chess champion garri kasparov and 
other leading grandmasters put away their boards for a few hours 
friday and played an exhibition soccer match with some former 
professional players 
you get fresh air and enjoyment and it shows that we are 
normal people who are interested in many things not just chess 
kasparov said afterward 
seven grandmasters from the chess world cup tournament which 
ended thursday scored a 33 tie with a team representing chess 
journalists and organizers 
both teams were bolstered by former professionals from spanish 
soccer powerhouse barcelona the grandmasters also fielded manuel 
orantes the former spanish tennis champion who is the nonplaying 
captain of spains davis cup team 
i had a very nice time said ljubomir ljubojevic a yugoslav 
grandmaster who tied for first place with kasparov in the 
tournament and who played for the youth soccer team of red star 
belgrade when he was 14 unfortunately we only assisted in the 
game the exprofessionals played more among themselves 
when the tall gangly figure of british grandmaster jonathan 
speelman ran too far down the field from his defensive position 
soviet grandmasters artur yusupov and valery salov shouted in 
english johnny come back 
several grandmasters already exhausted by three weeks of 
topflight chess competition only played in one of the two halves 
kasparov 26 was the only chess player to stay on the field for 
the whole game 
soccer matches have been played at some international chess 
events for years but grandmasters have become far more careful 
since dutch grandmaster jan timman broke his leg at a match during 
a tournament in 1984 in london 
despite impressive footwork from salov and agressive running 
from kasparov five of the six goals were scored by the 
exprofessionals the exception came when a dutch journalist drove 
the ball into the grandmasters goal in the second half 
football soccer is a great game said miguel illescas a 
spanish grandmaster we can forget all our rivalries and show 
good team spirit

maurice nyagumbo a zimbabwean 
independence leader whose implication in a corruption scandal 
forced his resignation from president robert mugabes cabinet has 
died from poisoning police sources said friday they were 
investigating the possibility of suicide 
the 64yearold nyagumbo who died thursday night resigned his 
posts as senior minister for political affairs and administrative 
secretary of the ruling party after he was found by a presidential 
inquiry to be involved in a racket involving the selling of cars 
and trucks on the black market 
he was one of the few surviving founders of the zimbabwe african 
national union patriotic front the party that waged a sevenyear 
guerrilla war and led the whitegoverned british colony of rhodesia 
to independence tuesday was the ninth anniversary of zimbabwes 
independence 
nyagumbo was being treated in the intensive care unit of 
harares parirenyatwa hospital after being admitted with 
convulsions on wednesday the nature of nyagumbos illness was 
being kept a secret by authorities but police sources said they 
were investigating the possibility he poisoned himself 
on thursday hospital superintendent sam mutamba told the 
semiofficial zimabwe interafrican news agency that nyagumbos 
condition was stable but he would not disclose the nature of the 
illness 
later as rumors circulated harare that nyagumbo had died as a 
result of poisoning the superintendent told ziana the man is 
still alive in this hospital do not worry about those rumors 
flying around these are rumors from people who wish him dead 
nyagumbo who had ranked thirdhighest in the party hierarchy 
was not invited to the independence celebrations earlier this week 
he had spent two decades in colonial prisons as an alleged 
terrorist and was widely acclaimed by black zimbabweans as one of 
the champions of political emancipation 
like most emergent black leaders nyagumbo had humble 
beginnings he was a herdboy from a village in the eastern 
highlands of zimbabwe 
after being educated in neighboring south africa where he 
waited on tables at whitesonly hotels he became a member of the 
local communist party he was expelled in 1955 for links to the 
socalled mau mau movement that yielded black rule in the british 
colony of kenya 
at home under successive white supremacist regimes he became 
more active in his crusade for black rule and spent much of his 
adult life behind bars 
but after independence he held key posts in the cabinet the 
15member politburo and the ruling partys 90strong central 
committee 
the judicial commission of inquiry set up by mugabe found 
nyagumbo abused his position by arranging for friends to buy 38 
cars and trucks directly from a state assembly plant ordinary 
zimbabweans usually have to wait up to 10 years to by a vehicle 
judge president wilson sandura who presented his report to 
mugabe on march 11 said he did not believe nyagumbo arranged the 
deals without rewards 
the minister himself denied receiving kickbacks but resigned 
his posts anyway 
nyagumbo was the most senior of six ministers to testify four 
other ministers a junior minister and a provincial governor have 
all since resigned their posts over links to corruption this month 
police say they are considering prosecuting many of the 60 
witnesses who gave evidence before judge president wilson sandura 
there was no comment from mugabe on the death of his old ally

nasa on friday selected lockheed 
missile systems division of sunnyvale calif to develop a new 
more powerful solid fuel rocket for the space shuttle 
the space agency is moving ahead on the advanced booster despite 
last months recommendation by a congressional safety panel that it 
discontinue the project 
lockheed estimated total cost of the sevenyear development 
project and facility work at more than 11 billion the companys 
principal subcontractor is aerojet space booster co of sacramento 
calif and its facility contractor is rust international of 
birmingham ala 
the contract includes an option for 44 sets of two motors each 
the new motor will replace in the mid1990s the current shuttle 
booster rocket 
a faulty booster rocket caused the explosion of the shuttle 
challenger and loss of its sevenmember crew in january 1986 the 
shuttle fleet was grounded for 32 months while the rocket was 
redesigned 
the aerospace safety advisory panel said the new booster should 
not be built because it would be too costly and would not be as 
reliable as the existing rocket 
we feel there would be an overall degrading of safety said 
panel chairman joseph sutter a retired boeing executive and a 
member of the presidential commission that investigated the 
challenger accident 
the advanced rocket will enable the shuttle to carry 12000 more 
pounds of payload it currently can lift 50000 pounds 
new facilities for the rocket development will be constructed at 
yellow creek a site in northeast mississippi

irans parliament speaker said friday the 
government has uncovered prous spy rings that included agents in 
sensitive places and senior naval officers who betrayed iranian 
warship movements 
thousands of shiite moslem worshipers chanted american spies 
must be executed after they listened to hashemi rafsanjanis 
allegations during a sermon at tehran university 
irans official islamic republic news agency reporting on the 
speakers statements said rafsanjani alleged the rings were 
involved in plots to overthrow ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
fundamentalist government and had been operating as far back as the 
1979 islamic revolution 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said he had no 
information on the allegations my information is we dont really 
know what theyre talking about they make similar claims every 
once in a while about american spies when they need a little 
attention 
but there is little doubt us intelligence agencies have 
operatives in iran given the islamic republics deep hostility for 
the great satan 
rafsanjanis statements appeared designed to stir up 
antiwestern sentiment to deflect attention from political problems 
at home 
the parliament speaker himself apparently has fallen from favor 
since persuading khomeini to accept an august ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war after a number of iranian military defeats 
he said the agents included big american spies who were 
being interrogated and he said the arrests had exposed the entire 
central intelligence agency in the middle east 
some spies were navy personnel who transmitted intelligence on 
iranian naval deployments to the us navy when they were 
fighting us in the persian gulf rafsanjani said 
he said the iranian ship iran ajr shot up and boarded by us 
forces in the gulf on sept 21 1987 while it was planting mines 
was betrayed by these very people 
iranian security agents seized sophisticated equipment 
including radio transmitters code books and even invisible ink 
used to send messages to the cia he claimed 
rafsanjani did not say how many people had been arrested because 
the americans should not know how many of them have been trapped 
there are too many he also did not identify any of the accused 
naval officers 
there have been reports three senior naval commanders were 
executed in early april for plotting to overthrow the government 
they were identified as adm kianoosh hakimi commander of naval 
communications and joint operations with the air force adm 
ghahreman malekzadeh naval representative at the chief of staffs 
office and adm farhad riahi commander of the airborne units 
dissident iranian sources said about 20 other prowestern navy 
officers had been arrested for alleged spying 
the sources have reported that several commanders of the 
revolutionary guards have been executed or arrested in recent weeks 
for plotting to assassinate iranian leaders 
rafsanjani said gods decree will be carried out and the 
alleged spies would be punished he did not elaborate he also said 
we have suffered some catastrophes and some damage because of 
the spies 
he said the alleged spies would appear on staterun television 
to explain their activities rafsanjani did not say when that 
would happen but added you will see that the arrest of so many 
spies is unprecedented in contemporary history 
hardliners led by interior ministry ali akbar mohtashemi and 
prosecutorgeneral mohhamad musavi khoeiniha have tightened their 
grip on power at the expense of socalled pragmatists like 
rafsanjani who favor building bridges with the west to end irans 
isolation 
that isolation has been enhanced by khomeinis call for the 
death of british author salman rushdie whose latest novel the 
satanic verses is seen by many as insulting to islam 
even most moslem countries have refused to support the death 
call 
the political casualties in iran have included khomeinis 
designated successor ayatollah husseinali montazeri he was 
dismissed last month after voicing increasing criticism of 
khomeinis policies and the revolutions shortcomings 
rafsanjani has sought to ride out the turmoil and has recently 
been touring military bases exhorting support for khomeini

hawaii lawmakers have decided not to spend 33 
million to buy a coral atoll nearly 1000 miles to the south and a 
member of the family that owns the property says plenty of other 
buyers have expressed interest 
the fullardleo family of honolulu had given state lawmakers 
until the end of their current legislative session scheduled to 
adjourn monday to come up with the money or it would sell the 
uninhabited palmyra atoll to someone else 
if the state doesnt buy it now im sure its not going to be 
here next year said ainsley fullardleo 57 the youngest of 
three brothers who own the ushaped string of islets 960 miles 
south of hawaii and 200 miles north of the equator 
house finance committee chairman joseph souki said the palmyra 
was not included in the state budget when it was finalized by house 
and senate conferees on thursday 
i think its too expensive anyway he said 
told of the legislatures decision fullardleo said i think 
the states making a big mistake 
now that the state has passed on it the family will probably 
consider other offers fullardleo said offers in the 30 million 
range and higher have come from us and japanese companies as well 
as one unidentified pacific nation he said 
palmyra has many attractive features including its status as a 
us possession its deep harbor an airstrip left over from world 
war ii and 150 inches of rainfall a year said sen richard 
matsuura a strong supporter of purchasing the property 
its located in one of the best fisheries in the pacific and 
could serve as a midpacific maritime center he said 
university of hawaii scientists say it is ideal for 
oceanographic and marine life research and a possible site for 
equatorial space launches 
reports of successful roomtemperature fusion energy experiments 
in which the precious metal palladium was involved prompted 
matsuura to note that palmyra is near ocean floor manganese crusts 
containing palladium 
most of the attention from private interests however has 
focused on building an exclusive resort on the 600 acres of land 
within the 8000acre reefprotected atoll

the state constitution says louis peck is 
too old to be on vermonts highest court peck disagrees and 
continues to hear and decide cases 
i dont think i should become senile as a matter of law 
said peck i might be as a matter of fact but certainly not of 
law 
peck turned 70 in december according to vermonts constitution 
he should have retired at the end of 1988 he did not believing 
the provision violates a federal act that prohibits age 
discrimination 
on his side is an opinion from the state attorney generals 
office saying the federal act supercedes the vermont mandatory 
retirement clause but a recent federal appeals court ruling in 
massachusetts raises new questions about pecks standing 
we have an attorney generals opinion that concludes justice 
peck is qualified to sit said thomas lehner the court 
administrator whether the attorney generals opinion is correct 
is an open question 
the 1974 provision of the state constitution is clear all 
justices of the supreme court and judges of all subordinate courts 
shall be retired at the end of the calendar year in which they 
attain 70 years of age 
but in 1986 congress amended the age discrimination in 
employment act of 1967 to prohibit discrimination regardless of 
age previously the law did not apply to anyone older than 70 
in 1987 peck and gov madeleine kunin asked the attorney 
generals office to review the apparent conflict between the state 
constitution and federal law in an opinion signed by attorney 
general jeffrey amestoy the office decided the federal law must 
prevail 
the supremacy clause of the us constitution makes it clear 
federal law controls if there is a conflict said amestoy 
but rulings by the attorney generals office do not have the 
force of a court decision they are only advisory and a federal 
court decision in neighboring massachusetts late last year shows 
there is room for disagreement 
the us court of appeals for the 1st circuit which covers 
massachusetts said it could not find any evidence in reviewing the 
congressional debate on the discrimination statute that congress 
meant for the law to usurp the state power to govern the tenure of 
judges 
without question the tenure of state judges is a question of 
exceeding importance to each state and a question traditionally 
left to be answered by each state the judges said any federal 
encroachment on a state freedom of choice in this area therefore 
strikes very close to the heart of state sovereignity 
peck feels strongly that age alone is not a good barometer of 
ability and noted that justices on the us supreme court routinely 
serve well past 70 
oliver wendell holmes served very well on the us supreme 
court until he was well into his 90s peck said in an interview 
this week 
peck wants the issue resolved in the courts but it is unclear 
how or when that will happen 
the massachusetts ruling has no force in vermont only a ruling 
by the 2nd circuit court of appeals which covers vermont or by 
the us supreme court could end the uncertainty over pecks 
position 
the equal employment opportunity commission on behalf of judges 
such as peck across the country is looking for a case to bring to 
the us supreme court to resolve the issue but it may be years 
before the countrys highest court issues a decision 
meanwhile peck continues to review cases with the four other 
justices lehner said it is believed that pecks rulings will stand 
even if a court eventually rules he should have retired at age 70 
obviously we are concerned because this is an open 
situation he said we have talked with justice peck about 
setting up a federal suit but right now we are relying on the 
attorney generals opinion that he can sit 
peck said he has three more years in his term and would then 
have to seek legislative retention to continue on the court he 
said he might consider retiring before his term is up but only if 
the issue is settled 
i am not doing this for my sake he said im doing this 
for the people who will come after i am determined to stay on 
until this is resolved

president bush signed a proclamation friday 
declaring may 1 as law day using the occasion to plug his 
proposed pay raise for federal judges to encourage the best legal 
talent for federal benches 
he said the nation has not yet reached the point where the oath 
taken by federal judges to administer justice without regard to 
person and do equal right to the poor and the rich is a 
reality for all americans 
our work is not done the work of ensuring that recourse to 
justice is within the reach of every individual in this nation for 
the poor especially the legal process can be a costly complex and 
extremely cumbersome route to the justice that they deserve bush 
said at the white house signing ceremony 
every citizens claim should be judged on its merits not on 
the basis of his status or place or standing in society its the 
very core of the democratic idea bush said 
speaking to a small group of people involved in the justice 
system including the american bar association president bush 
plugged his proposal to increase the pay of federal judges by 25 
percent calling that raise long overdue 
we must recruit and retain this nations best legal talent on 
the federal bench i urge each of you and all of those out there 
listening to give your strongest possible support to see that that 
measure wins quick approval he said 
in his proclamation he called on the legal profession schools 
government agencies the media and other organizations in society 
to focus public attention on the importance of making access to 
justice a reality for all persons

mark lane nationally known for his conspiracy 
theories about president kennedys assassination complained friday 
he has been kept from meeting john w hinckley jr by the mental 
hospital where hinckley has been since shooting president reagan 
a judge ruled thursday that they could meet during regular 
visiting hours 
lane said he has not decided whether to accept hinckleys 
request that he take on his case 
however the lawyer said we had an appointment a couple of 
weeks ago and the hospital authorities at the highest level decreed 
that i could not meet with mr hinckley instead they wanted to 
meet with me pulling together a summit meeting all the powers in 
washington to brief me 
i said that was absurd and that if a man wanted to obtain me 
the sanctity of the attorneyclient relationship is that it remains 
between an attorney and a client 
hinckley told a federal court judge thursday in his first 
public testimony ever that he wanted to hire lane as his attorney 
because he has done very well defending famous criminals 
he said of the proposed march 28 meeting with lane on the 
morning of the meeting all of a sudden it was pulled out from 
under me 
hinckley has been at st elizabeths mental hospital since his 
1982 acquittal by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of reagan 
and three others 
expressing concern that hinckley might expose himself to 
exploitation hospital authorities had sought court supervision of 
his interviews with lane or other attorneys 
us district judge june l green overruled the hospital and 
granted hinckley permission to interview lane or any other lawyer 
during visiting hours 
lane said he was surprised when hinckley called him in early 
march 
it was a funny conversation i didnt get his last name 
clearly thought his name was eakley lane said laughing during 
a telephone interview from daytona beach fla where he is 
representing a man on death row 
i told him i didnt know anything about his case and he said 
it was in all the newspapers 
i had gotten calls from st elizabeths patients before who all 
said their cases were famous and i told him i must have missed 
those newspapers please tell me what its about lane said 
during their few telephone conversations lane said hinckley 
told him he wanted to hire him as his attorney but lane told him 
they had to meet so that hinckley would know him better and lane 
would learn enough about the facts in his case to know if i could 
be of assistance to him 
during the hearing thursday hospital lawyer janet l maher 
asked hinckley whether he knew lane had written books about 
political assassinations and other people he represented 
i dont think its a crime that hes written these books and 
interviewed these people hinckley said i am sure that the 
subjects he has written about at some point gave their consent 
i am capable of deciding whether i want my story told and it 
is not the hospitals say to dictate whether i can do that said 
hinckley 
in his 1966 book rush to judgment lane disputed the 
findings of the warren commission that lee harvey oswald alone shot 
and killed president kennedy in 1963 in dallas 
hinckley also said he knew that at one time lane had represented 
james earl ray who killed the rev martin luther king jr 
lane said he has represented clients after writing books on 
their cases including ray and his current client james 
richardson but has never written a book as a result of my 
representation of a client 
he said he has no plans to write a book about hinckley and that 
hinckleys interest in retaining him was based solely on a desire 
for effective legal counsel rather than to collaborate on a book 
hinckley has been involved in court matters several times in 
recent years in connection with mental institution plans to allow 
him to leave for a visit with his family and for an outing with 
other patients the plans were scuttled both times 
lane said if the authorities at st elizabeths are as careful 
in understanding and analyzing mr hinckleys motives and condition 
as they are in analyzing my motives for writing a book which i have 
no intention to write then i think that mr hinckley is 
entitled to a new evaluation if the keepers are nuts you have to 
be very careful about accepting their conclusions

south african forces will be 
confined to their bases in northern namibia for 60 hours next week 
so black nationalist guerrillas can withdraw to angola without 
confrontation the government said friday 
foreign minister pik botha said the security forces would remain 
at their bases from 6 pm april 26 until 6 am april 29 
south africa plans to obtain cassette recordings from angolan 
officials in which commanders of the southwest africa peoples 
organization guerrillas order their troops to withdraw said 
defense minister magnus malan the recordings will be broadcast by 
radio and from loudspeakers on aircraft he said 
neither malan nor botha said what south africa would do if 
insurgents remained in namibia after april 29 malan said south 
africas response would depend in part on whether it suspected that 
swapo had established arms caches in namibia 
south africa says 1600 guerrillas from crossed into namibia 
beginning april 1 in violation of a peace accord that required them 
to remain at their bases in angola until midmay the accord is 
linked to a united nations plan to bring independence to the 
territory by april 1990 after 74 years of south african rule 
territorial officials say 289 guerrillas and 27 security forces 
members have been killed in fighting since april 1 
most of the fighting occurred during the first week of april 
although three insurgents were reported killed thursday the bodies 
of six guerrillas killed earlier were found friday according to 
police commissioner dolf gouws who ordered new searches of all 
battle sites 
territorial police said friday that about 520 guerrillas 
remained in namibia indicating that close to 800 guerrillas have 
withdrawn 
un forces in northern namibia have established assembly points 
where guerrillas can report and obtain safe passage to angola only 
a handful of insurgents have reported to the checkpoints with the 
others withdrawing on their own 
un troops are acting as a peacekeeping force during the 
oneyear plan to conduct free elections leading to namibias first 
independent black majorityruled government the plan called for 
the orderly unarmed return of guerrillas in midmay from bases in 
angola and tanzania 
swapo has been fighting for independence since 1966 
botha said the decision to confine south african forces to base 
was made after a meeting thursday involving officials from south 
africa angola and cuba signatories of a regional peace accord 
last december 
under the plan cuba agreed to withdraw its 50000 troops from 
angola where they have helped the marxist government in a war 
against south africanbacked rebels 
representatives of the three countries agreed that all swapo 
forces should return to bases at least 100 miles inside angola 
botha said 
the three countries are scheduled to meet again next week in 
cape town along with us and soviet observers

the bush administration should act now to 
focus public attention on alleged efforts by panamas military 
leader to control the upcoming election there and should send 
defense secretary dick cheney to inspect us troops protecting the 
canal sen richard lugar said friday 
lugar an indiana republican who is a former chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee said that the bush 
administration is already behind in the game but its not to late 
to marshal public opinion to at least make sure this vitally 
important election doesnt pass by unnoticed on page 12 of a few 
newspapers 
lugar said chances for free and fair elections in panama on may 
7 now appear to be remote because of control over the process 
exercised by that countrys military leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
the senator said cheney should visit the us southern command 
in panama within the next two weeks to highlight us concern over 
the elections and to demand a halt to escalating attacks on 
american military personnel by forces loyal to noriega 
the united states should also make clear now he said that 
economic sanctions against panama could be strengthened if the 
elections are perceived as unfair 
the white house should also declare that the sanctions could be 
removed altogether if fair play prevails he said 
noriega has clearly decided that controlling this election 
with overwhelming strongarm tactics is more important than 
appearing legitimate to the world through victory in a free and 
fair election lugar told a news conference 
he is trying to scuttle efforts by the center for democracy to 
help the world watch the election through the press lugar said 
noriega also is tightening restrictions on travel to the country 
and limiting hotel space to prevent the attendance of reporters and 
international observers the senator said 
lugar complained that the bush administration has been show to 
act on the panama matter there seems to be no particular 
direction in our government to do anything about it lugar said 
the situation seems to be going glimmering very rapidly 
it seems to me important that noriegas hand be called 
lugar said panama cannot remain on the back burner 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said the united states 
will make no accommodation with noriega who is under indictment in 
the united states for alleged narcotics trafficking 
lugar said the election thus poses an opportunity for panama to 
rid itself of noriega and return to democratic rule in the decade 
remaining before the canal is turned over to the government of 
panama under the terms of the panama canal treaties

the soviet union will begin the partial 
withdrawal of 10000 of its estimated 62000 troops in hungary on 
tuesday the commander of the kremlins forces in the country said 
friday 
colgen matvei burlakov said the pullout will involve 22 units 
comprising more than 10000 men 450 tanks 200 pieces of artillery 
and 3000 vehicles 
the pullouts are part of the withdrawal of 50000 men and 5000 
tanks from eastern europe announced by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev in december 
soviet troops begin partial withdrawal from east germany and 
czechoslovakia next month burlakov said 
he said the withdrawal will begin with the departure of 
artillery and missiles from the soviets 13th tank division in 
western hungary 
troop pullouts begin may 15 he added followed by the departure 
of a training tank regiment june 5 and the pullout of an air 
defense regiment starting june 20 he said 
a fighter regiment will leave by dec 1 while the withdrawal of 
airborne forces and a noncommissioned officers training school 
will go ahead next year he added 
burlakov said some 8000 conscripts and around 2000 officers 
will return to the soviet union from hungary 
those nearing retirement will be pensioned off but others will 
be redeployed on soviet territory he said 
according to figures published in hungary there are 62000 
soviet troops in hungary 
burlakov declined to give a figure saying only that the pullout 
affects roughly onequarter of all soviet units in hungary 
the withdrawals will be accompanied by a shift of soviet troops 
stationed near the border with austria to points further east 
burlakov said 
asked whether this meant the soviet union now sees little chance 
of an attack on the warsaw pact through neutral austria burlakov 
replied we would like to create a zone of peace between the 
warsaw pact and nato 
austria is not a member of the western military alliance or the 
sovietled bloc 
increasingly vocal demands have recently come from hungarys 
indepedent groups for hungarian neutrality 
asked whether he could envision this with hungary either leaving 
or remaining in the warsaw pact burlakov replied i think the 
competent highranking organs of the warsaw treaty will take a 
decision about that 
we would all like to carry this decision out when the time 
comes that such a decision is formally made he said 
replying to another question however he made clear that he 
could not envisage complete withdrawal of soviet troops from 
hungary unless nato made similar steps 
at the eastwest talks in vienna on reducing conventional arms 
in europe moscow has said it is willing to pare down to a purely 
defensive force by 2001 but only if nato makes reductions the 
western alliance says would shift the military balance of power in 
the easts favor

richard leakey a famed anthropologist and 
critic of kenyas effort to protect its big game animals has been 
named to head the countrys department of wildlife conservation and 
management 
the announcement thursday evening by the office of president 
daniel t arap moi was seen as another indication of the 
governments resolve to protect its wildlife from poachers and 
mismanagement 
tourists many of them attracted by the lure of seeing 
elephants lions rhinoceres and other animals in the countrys 38 
national parks game preserves and sanctuaries pumped more than 
130 million into kenya last year 
leakey replaces perez olindo with whom he feuded publicly last 
year along with george muhoho the minister for tourism and 
wildlife claiming some government officials were involved in 
elephant poaching leakey accused the pair of paying lip 
service to wildlife conservation 
muhoho whose ministry oversees the wildlife department in turn 
called leakey a cheeky white and termed his accusations false 
but the government later acknowledged that poaching particularly 
of elephants and rhinos had reached crisis proportions 
in the first half of 1988 alone 92 elephants were said to have 
been killed for their ivory tusks and moi ordered police and game 
rangers to shoot poachers on sight the crackdown brought the 
deaths of numerous poachers and some law enforcement officers 
in the last year gunmen also have ambushed and opened fire on 
tourist vehicles in game parks in southern and central kenya 
wounding several tourists 
the announcement of leakeys appointment offered no explanation 
for the move nor did it say whether olindo was being given a new 
government assignment 
leakey 45 is director of kenyas national museum and has 
served as chairman of the countrys wildlife society a native 
kenyan he is the son of the late louis and mary leakey themselves 
famed anthropologists

president bush plans to propose a national 
youth service program based on volunteerism energy secretary james 
d watkins told a senate panel friday 
watkins said the president would send proposed legislation to 
congress in a month outlining such a program to be based solely on 
volunteerism because civic obligation rather than financial 
incentive should be the motivation 
bushs program to be known as youth entering service would be 
aimed at people aged 5 to 25 to instill the notion that 
service to others is a necessary part of any definition of a 
successful life watkins told the senate labor and human 
resources committee 
through yes young people will not be financially compensated 
by the federal government for their service said watkins adding 
that the major motivation for service should be a sense of civic 
obligation rather than the promise of remuneration 
watkins said details of bushs plan were still being worked out 
he offered no immediate examples of how the system would work but 
he said the efforts would be tied in some way to service in local 
communities 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the committee chairman said 
the appearance by watkins is the first time that the bush 
administration has testified before the congress on the subject of 
national service kennedy chided the administration for delaying 
participation thus far in the legislative action 
the committee is considering nine national service bills 
including a controversial proposal by sen sam nunn dga linking 
government financial aid for college students to military or 
civilian service 
federal policy should enhance educational opportunities not 
trade one important interest against another said gregory a 
humphrey director of legislation for the american federation of 
teachers in opposition to the nunn bill 
echoing that sentiment leon horne a member of the executive 
committee of the national education association the nations 
largest union of teachers said such an approach would undermine 
equal educational opportunity for students from low and lower 
middleincome families 
stanley hill international vice president for the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees told the 
committee that minorities and women also stand the most to lose 
from a largescale community service program because they are 
concentrated in the lowerlevel job categories most likely to be 
displaced by national service activities 
the committee also heard testimony from two high school 
students cynthia brown of philadelphia and jacqueline loso of 
south burlington vt who described their participation in 
existing youth service programs they advised that financial 
assistance to develop new or maintain current programs was the most 
helpful federal government role in encouraging voluntary service

moslem guerrillas fired at least 12 
rockets into the capital on friday and initial reports said at 
least two people were killed 
afghan soldiers returned fire launching a barrage of missiles 
into the mountains east of kabul 
the exchange of fire continued for about two hours it was the 
biggest strike on the capital since april 15 when 11 rockets were 
fired killing at least three people

warriors are waging a war to oust the prosoviet government the 
rebels are supported by pakistan the united states saudi arabia 
and china 
rebel rockets struck the soviet embassy on thursday shattering 
windows but causing no casualties according to soviet diplomats 
who spoke on condition of anonymity they said they did not believe 
the strike from about 20 miles northwest of the capital was 
deliberate 
the united states closed its embassy in kabul before soviet 
troops completed their withdrawal feb 15 since then moslem 
insurgents have attacked kabul intermittently but have concentrated 
their firepower on the strategic eastern city of jalalabad 
radio kabul monitored in pakistan reported thursday that rebel 
rocket attacks on jalalabad had killed two people the guerrillas 
reportedly were blasting the city from key positions to the south 
and east said radio kabul the radio also said four people were 
hurt thursday when rockets landed in kabul 
jalalabads fall would be considered a major victory for the 
rebels it would be the biggest city they have captured and would 
be a major blow to the morale of the government western observers 
also have predicted a domino effect ending with the capital of 
kabul 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to back the 
government and withdrew the last of their troops in february under 
a unmediated accord

the air force mismanaged development of the 
nations satellite tracking and warning system contend 
congressional investigators who are calling on lawmakers to stop 
funding for the 437 million project until problems are resolved by 
the pentagon 
the air force has invested over 235 million in a system that 
is now more than four years behind schedule and far from meeting 
its required operational capability the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress said in a report 
the gao evaluated the services attempts to modernize the us 
space commands space surveillance and attack assessment subsystem 
known as the space defense operations center 
the system which is located at the cheyenne mountain air force 
station in colorado springs colo is a data processing and 
communications center designed to monitor about 10000 manmade 
objects in space provide warnings of any military attack in space 
and protect satellites from attack 
the subsystem is considered key to the operation of the north 
american aerospace defense command or norad which is responsible 
for alerting the united states and canada if north america is under 
air missile or space attack 
the gao said that over a fiveyear period the air force ignored 
warnings from technical contractors that the program would have 
difficulty achieving its requirements 
specifically the contractor expressed concerns about the 
systems security design deficiencies in the model used to predict 
performance and overall software design quality 
in response to the report which was released this week the 
defense department admitted that the initial phase of the system 
cannot perform 14 of 23 originally required missions 
but the department said it believes the air force has taken 
the necessary action to ensure that the later phases of the 
program avoid the pitfalls that have hampered the effort to date 
the air force plans to spend about 437 million on the project 
a substantial increase over its original estimate of 290 million 
previous estimates that the entire system would be operating by 
june 1988 also have changed 
the air force says the system will not be completed until fiscal 
1994 
the gao urged congress to withhold additional funds for the 
project until the defense acquisition board and defense secretary 
dick cheney have approved plans to meet the investigators 
recommendations

the sailors who survived the explosion 
aboard the uss iowa will need help coping with what may be the 
first tragedy many of them have experienced two psychiatrists said 
friday 
fortyseven crewmen most of whom were in their early 20s died 
in the fiery explosion of a gun turret wednesday as the battleship 
took part in training exercises near puerto rico 
many aboard the ship are younger and may not have had to 
experience grief before said navy psychiatrist cmdr john 
mateczun who works with the portsmouthbased special psychiatric 
rapid intervention team or sprint 
they wont have a model and may feel they cant have certain 
emotions or cant cry they may feel some shame 
its a whole developmental task that is new for them said 
dr jack corazzini director of university counseling services at 
virginia commonwealth university in richmond 
initial reactions to the tragedy by surviving crew members may 
include shock and disbelief relief they werent killed and guilt 
over being alive when companions are not corazzini said he said 
it is important that the survivors talk about their feelings to 
ward off problems later 
a sprint team of mental health professionals boarded the iowa 
when it anchored off puerto rico to remove the bodies of the dead 
the team works with those at greatest risk of suffering from the 
tragedy mateczun said including friends of the men killed and 
those whose lives were in the greatest danger during the explosion 
and fire 
a lot of what we do is educational he said we want to 
give people information about what normal human reaction is to 
extremely abnormal events 
when people start talking about emotions then others can say 
gee i felt that way too then theyre no longer isolated they 
can say i was scared i was afraid i was going to die and know 
this is a normal human response that has terrific therapeutic 
value 
followup counseling is crucial both psychiatrists said 
corazzini said six months or six years later an event that 
triggers a memory of the tragedy will cause pain just like it was 
yesterday among survivors 
the 19th of april will forever be in these peoples hearts and 
minds he said its not like youre ever cured of the grief 
said mateczun

chinas sevenmonth austerity program has managed 
to keep a lid on economic growth but has yet to solve problems of 
inflation overspending and excess investment the government said 
friday 
zhang zhongji of the state statistical bureau said industrial 
output value for the first quarter of 1989 increased by 104 
percent to 79 billion 
that was well down from an industrial growth rate of more than 
20 percent in 1988 although the march growth rate surged to 14 
percent after two straight months in the 8 percent range 
we have achieved initial results in cooling off the economy 
zhang said but he added that inflation is still too high 
contradictions in the economy are worsening and restoring 
economic order is still very difficult 
the government in september announced that for a twothree year 
period there would be severe restrictions on new credit cutbacks 
in government spending and cancellations of construction projects 
it said economic reforms including price reforms would be put off 
until inflation and excessive growth are overcome 
zhang said retail prices were unchanged from february to march 
but were up 279 percent compared with the same period last year 
the inflation rate has been over 30 percent in most chinese cities 
during the past year 
retail sales were up 226 percent to 564 billion he said 
zhang said the governments drive to boost grain production 
after four straight disappointing harvests appeared to be going 
well he said national funding for agricultural production was up 
313 percent in the first quarter to 746 million 
but the economy continued to be plagued by what zhang called the 
three highs and two irrationals 
the highs were inflation government spending and the soaring 
growth of consumer demand he said government offices have ignored 
demands for spending cutbacks and that spending increased 163 
percent in the first quarter while revenues were up only 49 
percent 
zhang said the surplus purchasing power of households has hit 
135 billion and that worker bonuses and allowances were up 39 and 
59 percent despite the austerity drive 
the irrationals were the continued growth of inefficient and 
nonproductive industries and misplaced investment 
energywasting consumeroriented industries continue to lead 
growth while staterun basic and heavy industries lag behind he 
said production of color tv sets was up 53 percent refrigerators 
by 50 percent and cassette recorders by 22 percent 
electricity output meanwhile was up only 3 percent coal 56 
percent and crude oil output fell slightly factories have had to 
cut back operating hours because of an increasingly serious energy 
shortage 
although state investment in capital construction projects 
dropped 83 percent to 2 billion local governments increased 
spending by 148 percent to 156 billion 
zhang said many local governments have taken a waitandsee 
approach to beijing orders to cancel or postpone construction 
projects 
zhang said foreign trade on a customs statistics basis was up 
155 percent in the first quarter to 212 billion exports were up 
94 percent to 966 billion and imports by 213 percent to 115 
billion 
he said the government had had little success in stopping the 
import of luxury consumer items such as cars motorcycles cameras 
and appliances

the army and police blocked hundreds of arabs 
from attending friday prayer services in jerusalem and armed 
jewish settlers marched in the occupied west bank to demonstrate 
israeli control over the land 
nineteen palestinians including a 3yearold boy were reported 
wounded in stonethrowing clashes with soldiers in the occupied 
territories 
arab doctors at alittihad hospital in the west bank city of 
nablus said the boy was hit in the head with a rubber bullet they 
said he was in moderate condition 
the most violent confrontation was reported in the gaza strip 
town of rafah where 10 palestinians were reported shot and 
wounded they included a 12yearold boy and a 14yearold girl 
both shot in the chest 
a 20yearold man shot in the chest in the jabaliya refugee camp 
was reported in critical condition hospital officials said 
the army confirmed two wounded 
the army said a 17yearold palestinian was killed thursday 
night when he was hit by plastic bullets during a clash with troops 
in the gaza strip 
his death raised to at least 440 the number of palestinians 
killed in the 16month uprising against israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip eighteen israelis have died 
soldiers and police manned checkpoints on main roads leading 
into jerusalem from ramallah bethlehem and jericho blocking 
hundreds of arabs from entering the city for weekly moslem prayers 
some elderly palestinians were allowed to proceed arab 
witnesses said 
police checked identity cards at entrances leading to the main 
mosques in jerusalems old city and dozens of residents of the 
occupied territories were turned away 
security has been tightened around the main mosque compound 
known to arabs as haram al sharif or noble enclosure since a 
rockthrowing protest broke out there after moslem prayers april 7 
and spilled over to the adjacent western wall 
the western wall or wailing wall is judiasms holiest site 
haram al sharif which houses the dome of the rock and al aqsa 
mosques is one of islams holiest sites 
no disturbances were reported friday and jerusalem police 
commissioner yosef yehudai attributed this to increased police 
security and an effort by moslem elders to control the crowd 
it is in their interest to control the situation yehudai 
said 
about 900 extra policemen and paramilitary police were posted 
around the moslem shrines including sharpshooters on rooftop 
posts israeli media reports estimated 5500 moslems attended 
prayers compared to 25000 when the rioting broke out april 7 
since capturing the old city from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war israel has taken pride in guaranteeing free access to all 
religious sites but senior military officials said it has become 
necessary to limit access to the mosque compound to avert violence 
about 300 jews were seen praying at the western wall and 
observers said this was fewer than usual during the weeklong 
passover holiday when jews mark the ancient israelites escape 
from slavery in egypt 
shortly after moslem prayers concluded about 30 jews from the 
gush etzion settlements near bethlehem marched up to the western 
wall behind six israeli flags 
several were armed with uzi submachine guns and m16 automatic 
rifles which they kept over their shoulders as they broke into a 
dance just outside the barricade at the shrine they left quietly 
after praying at the wall 
on their approach to jerusalem the settlers accompanied by 
police and army cars passed through the city of bethlehem in the 
occupied west bank 
this is a walk to show that jews can walk throughout the land 
of israel without fear that this is our country said mark zell 
36 a lawyer who immigrated to israel from washington its a 
response to what happened in the last 16 months 
but jamal a 35yearold palestinian who watched the settlers 
pass said they want to show us that this is ther land but they 
have to carry all these guns it shows that they are afraid of 
us he refused to give his family name 
jamal was standing among 10 arab men several of whom said they 
were prevented by the army from going to jerusalem for friday 
prayers

the pilot and surviving crew of the aloha 
airlines jetliner that ripped open over hawaii a year ago received 
awards for heroism friday as a federal agency neared the end of its 
investigation of the incident 
the pilot of the nowscrapped boeing 737 robert schornstheimer 
credited incredible luck for his being able to land the plane 
safely after a 20foot section of fuselage tore away last april 28 
chief flight attendant clarabelle lansing was flung out of the 
airliner to her death but all 95 other people aboard survived 
the national transportation safety board has tentatively set may 
9 for final discussion of possible causes of the incident and 
recommendations to prevent it from happening again the federal 
aviation administration has already issued several orders for 
increased inspections repairs and replacements as a result of that 
and other problems with older aircraft 
schornstheimer accepting the aeroclub of washington award from 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said new airliners should 
not be designed with so much sophisticated technology that it gets 
in the way of a pilot flying manually in an emergency 
once programmed by pilots stateoftheart aircraft computers 
can almost auto fly the airplane from one airport to another we 
must consider what would have happened to our aircraft without 
humans not only being at the controls but with maintained 
proficiency to fly it schornstheimer said 
pilots do not like to be totally reliant on these 
evermorecomplex systems he said 
also receiving awards were the flights first officer madeline 
mimi tompkins who is now an airline captain and flight 
attendants michelle honda and jane satotomita the club which was 
founded in 1909 to foster interest in aviation also gave a 
posthumous award to ms lansing 
skinner read a letter to the crew from president bush which said 
their feat speaks eloquently of the strength of the human 
spirit the crew has received other awards and met with bush last 
year when he was vice president 
men and women around the globe will long remember that 
miraculous landing and the bravery and skill that you 
demonstrated on that fateful day bush wrote 
skinner at the end of the ceremony said that despite the 
incident which has increased concern over aging airliners travel 
by plane is still one of the safest modes of transportation and 
us air travel is the safest in the world

the us military does not have an oil 
skimming vessel as large as the 425foot long soviet ship 
vaidagubski but has sent a fleet of smaller vessels to the cleanup 
effort off the coast of alaska pentagon spokesmen said friday 
the army has dispatched two specially fitted dredges to help 
skim the oil the essayons 350feet long and the yaquina 200 
feet long said ed greene a spokesman for the us army corps of 
engineers which owns the vessels 
the yaquina based in portland ore reached the stricken area 
on wednesday and has collected an estimated 1500 tons of oil said 
maj kathy wood a pentagon spokeswoman the essayons based in san 
francisco is being sent to the tip of the kenai peninsula she 
said 
the navy has 22 smaller skimmers at work off the alaskan coast 
said wood 
each skimmer is 36 feet long and 12 feet wide two boats pull 
each skimmer and a 300foot oil boom through the water every hour 
the skimmer can suck up 3600 gallons of liquid which is collected 
in a bladder and can be pumped into another ship or replaced with 
another bladder said wood 
additionally a navy amphibious transport dock the uss juneau 
is en route and expected to arrive at prince william sound on 
monday wood said the juneau 570 feet long and 84 feet abeam is 
equipped with two ch46 sea knight helicopters can house 900 
people and has been loaded with oil skimming dredge and bladder 
materials 
it will provide a command and control capability in the sound 
which we do not currently have said wood 
the army corps of engineers has two dredges that are larger than 
the essayons and yaquina the wheeler 409 feet long stationed in 
the gulf of mexico and the mcfarland 300 feet long stationed on 
the atlantic coast 
the coast guard which has taken over direction of the cleanup 
effort has not requested use of the mcfarland or the wheeler said 
greene both would need to be fitted with special equipment to skim 
oil and would require many days to transit the panama canal 
and reach the alaskan coast he said 
the first two navy skimmers on the scene were flown in a c5 
transport plane from travis air force base calif arrived there 
on march 27 three days after the spill and began work on march 28

academys screening committee eliminated him and other reformers 
when it cut the list of candidates on the final ballot from more 
than 100 to 23

oldstyle academic bureaucrats and organized a campaign to reject 
them in the first election last month only eight of the 23 were 
approved 
this time 28 candidates were nominated for the 12 seats still 
open and sakharov sagdeev shmelev and other reformers were

the south yorkshire police chief on 
friday accepted responsibility for the crowdcontrol methods used 
by officers in the soccer stadium disaster that killed 95 people 
but chief constable peter wright also predicted a government 
inquiry into the april 15 tragedy will clear the police 
i welcome the inquiry which is about to take place and will 
undoubtedly reveal the true nature and cause of this terrible 
tragedy i believe that when it is completed the actions of the 
south yorkshire police will be seen in a very different light 
wright told a meeting of the local police authority in sheffield 
police have been criticized for opening a locked gate during the 
match at hillsborough stadium which allowed as many as 3000 
latearriving fans to surge into a crowded standingroomonly area 
of the stadium 
many fans were crushed to death against barriers and perimeter 
fencing just minutes into the english football association 
semifinal match between liverpool and nottingham forest 
those officers were appointed by me to make those decisions 
and it follows that i accept full responsibility for the police 
action connected with the event wright said 
wright said 1111 officers were on duty 257 inside the grounds 
and 854 outside he said the number of officers outside the opened 
gate was the same as for previous semifinals at the stadium 
the home office said friday that 43 people were arrested at the 
stadium the day of the disaster more than half for drunkenness 
and 19 policemen were injured 
sir peter taylor an appeals court justice leading the inquiry 
into britains worst sports disaster went to liverpool to pay his 
respects at anfield stadium home ground of the team whose fans 
were killed he said his inquiry will open april 28 
this scene is a most poignant and moving one which makes one 
realize how deeply this community has been afflicted and how deeply 
it feels its loss taylor saidwe are all conscious of that 
and we are all conscious of the need to ensure that it must never 
happen again 
taylor said he plans to attend a soccer match incognito and 
watch from the standingroom area to see what actually happens 
there 
eighteen victims of the disaster were buried friday in 
liverpool 178 miles north of london 
two liverpool players were among more than 700 mourners at 
aigburth methodist church in liverpool for the funeral of philip 
hammond 13 
canon john newton told them as we grieve let us all resolve 
that we will learn the bitter lessons of this tragedy that we will 
make the safety of spectators an absolute priority in professional 
football 
at st josephs roman catholic church another liverpool player 
and coach attended the funeral of the oldest victim 67yearold 
gerard baron baron had attended the match with his 28yearold 
son who survived 
a second hearse was needed to carry barons flowers including

soviet economic reform is in danger of drowning in 
a flood of too much money in circulation the kremlins chief 
ideologist warned friday 
vadim a medvedev speaking at a meeting to celebrate the 119th 
anniversary of soviet founder vladimir i lenins birth said if 
the country cant curb the stream of money that has overflowed 
then the result could be the failure of economic reform 
medvedev was referring to the fact that soviet citizens have 
lots of money but little to buy in the stores as a result new 
shipments of consumer goods sell out quickly and many items are 
hard to find 
a senior government statistician revealed friday the problem is 
worsening 
average wages rose 95 percent in the first three months of 
1989 compared with the same period a year earlier but 
productivity increased just 45 percent and consumer goods 
production rose 58 percent said nikolai g belov first deputy 
chief of the state statistics board 
soviet statistics unlike western ones do not account for 
inflation 
wages have risen much faster than projected much faster than 
productivity of labor which adversely affects the market 
situation belov said 
the average wage of soviet workers jumped from 347 to 379 a 
month in the first three months belov said 
as a result of the deficit of goods soviets are saving massive 
amounts of money belov said about 497 billion is being kept in 
savings accounts and is out of circulation 
medvedev the member of the ruling politburo responsible for 
ideology culture and propaganda said that without a hard 
stable ruble the whole system of economic regulators cannot work 
the soviet rubleexchange rate is set by the government at 162 
per ruble but the black market rate is 12 cents to 25 cents per 
ruble 
medvedev also said the move toward a more marketoriented 
economy is proceeding slower than desired factories are supposed 
to be developing their own suppliers and customers instead of 
depending on centralized allocations 
he also cited pricing and the government deficit as key 
problems soviet prices are set by bureaucrats with no regard to 
cost of production the budget deficit is estimated at 160 billion 
this year 
the ideologist emphasized the justice of paying people according 
to their ability and output president mikhail s gorbachev has 
also said the old system of encouraging equality must end 
demagogic calls to equalize everything and everybody are alien 
to socialism medvedev said 
the 60yearold ideologist spoke in the giant hall of the 
kremlins palace of congresses before the politburo and a capacity 
audience of workers military officers and other dignitaries 
medvedev has come out in favor of a moderate course for 
perestroika saying the party is steering a course between 
extremists who want either no reform or too much too fast

the search for a mysterious monster from the 
black lagoon that may be gobbling helpless baby ducklings in a 
downtown nature pond ended friday with the sighting of two wellfed 
catfish swishing lazily through the shallows 
the catfish were spotted by national park service ranger helen 
horton who was slogging through the muck wearing rubber hip waders 
and armed with a longhandled rake and fish net after the pond 
normally about three feet deep had been all but drained 
the catfish are a strong possibility pronounced her boss 
biological engineer john hoke they just love ducks yes the 
catfish are an awfully good smoking gun 
hoke said he would refill the pond outside the main entrance to 
interior department headquarters and set an underwater trap for the 
catfish as soon as possible meantime the remaining three 
ducklings will have to take their chances on survival 
the ducklings plight has aroused the sympathy and worried 
concern of scores of federal office workers who stroll past bolivar 
pond or pause for a midday picnic in the small surrounding park 
that also features an equestrian statue of south american liberator 
simon bolivar 
a female mallard duck that had taken up residence in the pond 
with several male companions gave birth to 11 ducklings last week 
on monday nine of the fluffy yellowfaced babies remained the 
next day there were seven 
kathie otoole an interior department budget analyst became 
alarmed and telephoned the park service she feared the ducklings 
were victims of a snapping turtle workmen began slowly draining 
the pond on thursday to try to find what a park service spokesman 
jokingly called the monster from the black lagoon 
by friday morning only three ducklings were left darting here 
and there under the protective gaze of their mother 
jeez its devastating said cindy archer a graphic artist 
from nearby american red cross headquarters who has visited the 
pond frequently this week 
other passersby including bemedaled daughters of the american 
revolution conventioneers peered anxiously down at the remaining 
ducklings some tossed them bread crumbs or popcorn 
i can see it the loch ness monster comes up at night and 
glump said one woman maybe theres an alligator in there 
said another 
ms hortons rake failed to uncover any snapping turtles under 
the large partially submerged log or the planters containing 
irises cattails and spiky water cannon or hiding on a little 
island in the shadow of a bald cypress 
other early suspects were racoons or rats known to inhabit 
neighboring shrubbery or burrows both animals are meat eaters who 
can swim underwater but hoke eliminated them because no trace of 
the missing ducklings such as feathers or scraps of meat or bone 
has ever been found 
racoons are very fastidious even washing their hands after a 
meal but i cant believe they would eat feathers he said 
these ducklings simply disappear its either a gulper or people 
or something that would remove them entirely 
hoke said the catfish probably were dumped into the pond by what 
he derisively calls midnight environmentalists 
wellintentioned nature lovers who introduce hazardous creatures 
into a carefully balanced natural habitat in an urban setting 
wildlife experts were much more sanguine about the ducklings 
disappearance than the passersby who crowded around the pond this 
week 
the loss of ducklings is always unfortunate but it is not 
abnormal to lose 50 percent of a brood in the wild said mike 
smith a spokesman for the us fish and wildlife service 
freshly hatched ducklings are extremely vulnerable and very easy 
targets for predators 
said ms horton 
animals have more offspring than can possibly survive and 
once they die they provide a valuable source of food for other 
animals its all part of the natural order of things 
it happens all the time in the wilderness but its hard for 
people right here in the city to watch nature doing its thing

aristotle onassis plotted with photographers to 
publish candid nude photographs of jacqueline kennedy onassis so 
she would stop complaining about tamer shots taken by papparazzi 
according to a new book 
he figured if she appeared in the nude nothing else they did 
could ever offend her again the late lawyer roy cohn is quoted 
as saying in a woman named jackie an upcoming unauthorized 
biography of the former first lady written by c david heymann it 
is being serialized in the weekly star a supermarket tabloid 
the photographs of mrs onassis sunbathing on skorpios the 
greek island where she married onassis in 1968 were taken by 10 
photographers using telephoto lenses and underwater cameras and 
appeared in magazines around the world 
nancy tuckerman spokeswoman for mrs onassis said when the 
first part of the series appeared last week that the former first 
lady would have no comment 
the book also detailed mrs onassis lavish spending sprees and 
said that the question of money came up at the funeral of onassis 
who died on march 15 1975 the star reports in its monday edition 
mrs onassis brotherinlaw sen edward kennedy who earlier 
had negotiated her prenuptial contract with onassis rode in the 
funeral limousine with her and christina onassis aristotles 
daughter 
christina onassis who has since died told heymann in a brief 
interview that kennedy turned to her in the limousine and said 
now its time to take care of jackie 
it seemed almost inconceivable that ted kennedy would choose 
that moment to discuss financial matters said christina onassis 
but it was jackies hyenalike smile that drove me from the car 
she was like a hungry vulture waiting to feast on my fathers 
flesh

oliver norths jury debated his guilt or 
innocence in a tightly guarded room friday as an alternate juror 
who heard all the testimony said she would have voted to convict 
him on some of the 12 charges 
the jurors deliberated for about six hours before quitting for 
the day they will resume saturday morning 
mr north wasnt made to do what he did said horasina 
mckie one of five alternates dismissed when the case went to the 
jury he had a choice in it he had a choice to either say no i 
dont want to do this or yes sir i will do this even as it went 
along and he knew it was wrong 
north is charged with withholding information from congress 
lying to attorney general edwin meese iii about his activities in 
the irancontra affair destroying and altering documents misusing 
money entrusted to him and accepting an illegal gratuity a 
13800 security system at his home 
ms mckie said she had not discussed the case with other jurors 
following the strict instructions given daily by us district 
judge gerhard a gesell and did not know how they feel 
if that held true for the entire jury the nine women and three 
men judging north discussed the former national security council 
aide for the first time starting at 940 am 
they could not help but notice on their arrival and on their 
departure that the courthouse between the capitol and the white 
house had become a news media center huge television trucks were 
parked on the street wires snaked around the building and cameras 
were aimed at every entrance 
the jurors quickly had requests relayed to the judge on notes 
they asked for copies of gesells instructions which took more 
than two hours to read in court for note pads paper clips and 
pencils 
jury members will deliberate a half day on saturday but not on 
sunday their lunches in the courthouse are being catered 
after a night sequestered in a downtown hotel the jurors were 
brought to the federal courthouse in a van and taken to an 18by12 
room only a few feet away from the courtroom where they had 
listened to testimony for eight weeks their room was further 
crowded with hundreds of exhibits some still classified as top 
secret a us marshal guarded the door 
the foreman is a 34yearold hospital clerk denise anderson 
who said during pretrial questioning that she does not like news 
and that the extensive television coverage given norths testimony 
during the 1987 congressional hearings made me mad i did not 
look at it at all 
ms mckie the alternate juror who commented in an interview 
with cbs news touched on one of norths major defenses that he 
was authorized to do all he did 
no one said if you dont do this were going to fire you 
the alternate juror said in his instructions gesell had told the 
jury to remember that no one including the president had the 
right to order an unlawful act 
i believe mr reagan knew what was going on ms mckie said 
i cant say he knew everything but i think he knew enough to 
know what was going on i mean you see national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane every week hes only 100 yards from you or feet 
from you 
reagan told the investigative tower commission two years ago 
that he did not know the national security council staff was 
engaged in helping the contra rebels in nicaragua when official 
us aid was banned 
north testified he was acting under orders even when he lied to 
a congressional committee in denying he was assisting the contras 
he said that he had no idea any of his actions violated the law and 
that he had good motives for what he did 
if convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 60 years in 
prison and fined as much as 3 million however federal court 
practice is generally to limit sentences to the longest term for 
any one count in this case 10 years

the united states accused hardline communist 
states on friday of repeatedly violating an eastwest accord on 
free speech as one example it cited the imprisonment of 
czechoslovak playwright vaclav havel 
dusan spacil the chief czechoslovak delegate at a 35nation 
conference to monitor the ageement retorted that the united states 
had no right to tell east bloc countries how to comply 
what gives marks ambassador leonard h marks the us 
delegation chief the authority to say who are the good guys and 
who are the bad guys asked spacil i dont think we need it 
spacil attacked the us delegation at the end of opening 
addresses in which western countries headed by the united states 
and canada singled out czechoslovakia romania bulgaria and east 
germany as the accords worst offenders 
western countries have contrasted the records of the four states 
with moves in the soviet union poland and hungary toward greater 
press and other freedoms 
the conference began tuesday and is to last a month it is a 
followup to the accord signed by the 35 nations last january at 
the end of the conference on european security and cooperation in 
vienna negotiations on the accord began in helsinki in the 1970s 
marks a former director of the us information agency said 
havel was jailed partly on allegations that he sought to incite 
disturbances through foreign radio broadcasts 
is that in the spirit of helsinki said marks 
marks added in his opening address to the conference that in 
romania foreign journalists have been illtreated and three 
romanian journalists remain under arrest for allegedly producing a 
leaflet critical of the government 
he accused bulgarian authorities of suppressing the soviet 
policy of glasnost or greater openness and said the east german 
government continued strict press censorship 
marks was the last speaker in four days of public sessions that 
have been marked by a conciliatory attitude on the part of the 
soviet delegation while western delegates turned on the four least 
reformist of the kremlins allies 
soviet officials complained however that londonbased soviet 
journalists have been prevented from covering a series of british 
disasters because they need british government permission to travel 
more than 25 miles outside london 
similar restrictions apply to western journalists in the soviet 
union 
recent disasters in britain included such major international 
stories as the pan am bombing over scotland in december which 
killed 270 people and a crush at a soccer match in sheffield 
northern england a week ago in which 95 spectators died

city health services and be fair to those who care 
testimony by city finance officials had barely begun when 
protesters began climbing over railings and seizing microphones on 
members desks to make speeches or shout slogans 
a dozen police buses and paddy wagons raced to city hall and 
officers quickly lined the chamber as the protesters shouted you 
say cut back we said fight back 
council president joseph c coleman tried to gavel the 
protesters into silence a number of times but gave up shortly 
before 1130 am and called a recess until afternoon 
most of the protesters then left but about 40 stayed 
when city officials tried to reconvene the hearing the 12 
protesters who refused to go to the part of the room set aside for 
the public were detained 
the hearing then proceeded quietly with a limited number of 
people allowed to sit in the spectators gallery many held protest 
signs in silence 
protesters will attend every council meeting and budget hearing 
until the budget is approved said joe rogers an activist with 
project share an advocacy group for the homeless and mentally ill 
well be demanding that they develop a human budget a humane 
budget that doesnt cut back at the cost of the poor said

city councilman angel ortiz a democrat who has opposed the 
cuts said he felt the protest effectively showed the budget is a 
very mean budget

would have no effect on his support for less social spending

writing for the panel judge harry t edwards said the case 
closely paralleled a 1984 case involving west michigan broadcasting 
co in which this court expressly held that the fccs use of an 
enhancement for minority status easily passes constitutional 
muster 
fcc spokeswoman maureen peratino said commission chairman dennis 
patrick would have no comment on the decision 
andrew schwartzman executive director of the media access 
project hailed the ruling 
this is a sound policy promoting core democratic values and a 
sound decision upholding it schwartzman said 
the justice department had intervened on behalf of the 
plaintiffs 
the case began in 1983 when an administrative law judge first 
awarded the license to metro after disqualifing rainbow for lack 
of candor in its application 
rainbow and winter park appealed to an fcc review board which 
reversed the judge on the candor issue and awarded the license to 
rainbow the judge said rainbow had 90 percent hispanic ownership 
participation whereas metro had only one 198 percent partner who 
was black 
the board said the minority and slight female ownership 
advantage outweighed factors in metros favor 
after metro and winter park appealed to the court the fcc in 
1986 began reviewing its comparative preference policies it found 
that absent rainbows minority advantages rainbow would not have 
gotten the license over metro 
on dec 22 1987 thenpresident reagan signed an appropriations 
measure in which congress forbade the fcc from spending any money 
to continue the reexamination of or change its minority policies 
winter park argued it should have been given the license in 
order to establish the first tv station in the community of winter 
park where it also would have served orlando along with five other 
stations there the court rejected winter parks argument and 
assessed the minority preference issues 
edwards and judge daniel m friedman concurred in the ruling 
while judge stephen f williams agreed in part and dissented in 
part 
in his dissent williams said the west michigan decision to 
make race pivotal in license allocations had been undermined 
by more recent supreme court decisions on minority setaside 
programs 
the appeals court in its march 31 ruling had thrown out the 
fccs socalled distress sale policy which allowed broadcasters in 
jeopardy of losing their licenses to quickly sell to a minority 
enterprise at 75 percent of the stations fair market value

authorities blamed communist rebels 
for fridays ambushslaying of an american colonel and the us 
ambassador said the killing will only strengthen us support for 
president corazon aquino 
col james nick rowe was dead on arrival at a suburban 
philippine military hospital moments after at least two gunmen in a 
stolen car sprayed his vehicle with gunfire as he headed for work 
officials said 
rowe 51 a native of mcallen texas was a decorated vietnam 
war hero who was held in a cage for five years by the viet cong as 
a prisoner of war until he escaped in 1968 
rowe was chief of the army division at the joint us military 
advisory group headquarters in the manila suburb of quezon city 
the unit provides training and logistical support to the philippine 
military which is fighting a 20year communist insurgency 
no group claimed responsibility for the attack but defense 
secretary fidel ramos said filipino officials believe the killers 
were communist rebels he noted the rebels had threatened to attack 
us targets unless the united states closed its bases here and 
stopped aiding mrs aquinos government 
us ambassador nicholas platt said in a statement he was 
uncertain about the rebels involvement 
but should anyone think that killing this brave officer will 
alter in any way us policy of support for philippine democracy 
they are wrong he said this act will only strengthen 
american resolve to stand with the government and people of the 
philippines led by president aquino we will not be deterred by 
terrorists 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called the 
killing a cowardly and heinous act 
col rowe was in the philippines to help the filipino people 
in their efforts to defend democracy fitzwater said we will 
work closely with the philippine government in their efforts to 
track down and bring to justice those responsible for this 
assassination 
rowes body accompanied by his wife suzanne and two children 
was flown by helicopter from the hospital to clark air base 50 
miles north of manila funeral plans were incomplete 
rowes filipino driver was wounded in the 7 am attack three 
blocks from rowes office 
police said up to three cars may have been used in the ambush 
but witnesses said they saw only one with at least three men a 
driver and two gunmen one gunman had an m16 rifle and the other a 
45caliber pistol they said 
the attack came five days after the communist national 
democratic front warned the rebels were determined to make us 
imperialism pay dearly for the continuing stay of its bases and its 
escalating intervention in our peoples affairs 
the statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing 
of a us communications station in the northern province of 
benguet no one was hurt in the april 9 bombing 
in october 1987 rebels killed three americans and a filipino 
outside clark the killings caused authorities to increase security 
at six us military installations and civilian offices here 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said future 
attacks probably would be against officers assigned to the advisory 
group for which rowe worked soldiers were warned to vary their 
routes to and from work and to tint their car windows to avoid 
detection 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher was asked by 
reporters in washington about the safety of americans in the 
philippines he noted a us travel advisory issued march 15 
indicates areas of the country where because of criminal 
activity or terrorist activity people should try to avoid the 
advisory states most urban areas in the philippines including 
manila are safe for travelers 
boucher then was asked if that advisory might be revised im 
sure that will be looked at he said i would note that the 
threats that i have heard about were against official americans 
and werent general threats to travelers 
rowe was imprisoned in the jungles of vietnam by the viet cong 
from october 1963 until he escaped on new years eve 1968 he later 
wrote a book about the ordeal titled five years to freedom 
after returning to the united states he was made chief of the 
armys survival evasion resistance and escape training unit at 
fort bragg nc which included antiterrorism techniques he 
later served as commander of the 1st special warfare training 
battalion at fort bragg 
rowes decorations included the silver star legion of merit 
two bronze stars two purple hearts the meritorious service medal 
a national defense service medal the vietnam service medal an 
army service ribbon and the republic of vietnam gallantry cross

more than 900 roman catholics have 
petitioned the providence diocese to protest its order that they 
remove elaborate decorations from their loved ones graves the 
groups leader said friday 
it was traumatic experience losing an 11yearold son said 
one of the protesters robert kelley you find a decoration you 
like and they tell you you cant use it 
he and others said the silk and plastic wreaths which encircle 
the headstones in a vinelike fashion are better than potted or 
stem flowers which are often stolen or tipped over at st ann 
cemetery 
kelley joined by a few friends and relatives took a baseball 
bat to the cemetery friday saying he was prepared to go to 
jail to preserve the decorations 
the church established new guidelines governing grave 
decorations in january replacing ones that were at least 30 years 
old the move followed complaints that the decorations were 
inappropriate diocesan officials said 
monsignor salvatore matano cochancellor of the diocese said 
although the church does not allow decorations attached to 
monuments it will continue to allow vases of flowers as a happy 
medium that allows for dignity and decorum 
our cemeteries must reflect a christian attitude toward 
death matano said the emphasis really should not be placed so 
much upon a place of burial 
the dispute has inflamed the emotions of many with relatives 
buried in the states nine catholic cemeteries rhode island is 
about 63 percent catholic considered by diocese the highest rate 
in the nation 
a petition signed by 915 people calling themselves catholics 
for fair play was sent to bishop louis e gelineau asking him to 
rescind the new rules said albert loffredo jr who heads the 
protest he also runs monumental decor co which provides and 
maintains the vines to customers for 85 for a fouryear contract 
plus 28 annual upkeep fee 
loffredo and his 38 clients received a letter from a diocesan 
attorney last week informing them they had seven days to remove 
the decorations which had provoked complaints from persons who 
own the right of interment at other burial sites 
i got a call telling me the decorations wouldnt be there 
after friday said gabriel petrucci whose parents and wife are 
buried at the st ann he said he was told if youre not 
satisified you can dig your loved one up and move 
the protesters said the decorations had not been removed by 
friday afternoon church officials did not return calls 
the diocese has said it decided to clarify and enforce its 
policy last christmas when loffredos elaborate decorations at his 
grandparents grave prompted others to match them

former labor secretary raymond donovan is 
asking the federal government to pay 112281 in legal bills he 
says he incurred during an investigation of an alleged kickback 
supposedly paid donovan in 1977 
donovan and his lawyers say the legal fees and expenses are for 
the period march 1987 through october 1987 in connection with the 
probe by independent counsel leon silverman 
the information was released friday by a special threemember 
panel of appeals court judges which appointed silverman 
federal law on independent counsels provides for the government 
to pay legal fees if the subject of the criminal investigation 
isnt indicted 
william bittman another partner seven associates and three 
paralegals of the law firm pierson ball and dowd provided legal 
services and incurred expenses totaling 79228 said the 
application paul curran four associates and one paralegal of the 
firm kaye scholer fierman hays and handler are seeking 33052 
in fees and expenses 
donovan was cleared in the probe of accusations that he may have 
lied when he denied knowing anything about the alleged kickback 
scheme which involved a former supplier of schiavone construction 
co where donovan was working at the time 
silverman concluded that although there was some evidence to 
support an indictment a conviction is unlikely and charges 
not warranted 
one witness in the probe was elderly ailing and had a failing 
memory said silverman while another was a convicted felon 
awaiting sentencing who had given inconsistent statements

a soviet literary journal will publish selections 
from the gulag archipelago alexander solzhenitsyns banned 
book on stalins labor camps a secretary at the magazine said 
friday 
some chapters from the long work will appear this year in the 
monthly magazine novy mir valentina ivanovna said in a telephone 
interview 
she refused to say who in the soviet leadership had approved 
publication of the gripping tale of repression under stalin 
in november communist party ideology chief vadim a medvedev 
told a news conference that said exposing soviets to such books 
would undermine society 
i am against the publication of a number works by 
solzhenitsyn and in the first place such works as lenin in 
zurich and the gulag archipelago he said 
but the washington post on friday quoted novy mirs chief 
editor sergei p zalygin as saying in an interview that president 
mikhail s gorbachev supported publication of solzhenitsyns works 
ms ivanovna said zalygin was unreachable 
novy mir published solzhenitsyns short novel one day in the 
life of ivan denisovich in november 1962 
the gulag is a triology that maintains widescale political 
repression began in the soviet union under founder vladimir i 
lenin 
zalygin said last year he was negotiating for the rights to 
print solzhenitsyns novel cancer ward ms ivanovna said no 
decision had been made about publishing works of solzhenitsyn other 
than the gulag 
several writers artists and activists have clamored for 
publication of solzhenitsyns works citing gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost which among other things allows reexamination of sore 
points in soviet history like stalins reign of terror 
in february a journal of the soviet peace committee titled 
twentieth century and peace carried a commentary crediting 
solzhenitsyn for helping pave the way for gorbachevs reforms 
the reforms have led to publication of soviet authors that had 
been long banned others that have come into the open include the 
novel doctor zhivago by boris pasternak and the political 
satire heart of a dog by mikhail bulgakov 
solzhenitsyn was arrested branded a traitor and expelled for 
his writings

west germany will press the united 
states to agree to early superpower talks on the reduction of 
shortrange nuclear missiles officials said friday 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg will urge washington to end its opposition to 
early talks with the soviet union on the missiles issue said 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
the decision came out of talks between leaders of the 
governments governing coalition parties that forged a common 
policy on the missile debate sources said 
genscher and stoltenberg are scheduled to fly to washington on 
monday for talks with us officials 
west germany has resisted strong us and british calls to 
upgrade the current aging generation of shortrange nuclear 
missiles 
chancellor helmut kohl wants nato to postpone a decision on the 
missiles until after west germanys national election in december 
1990 
kohls party has lost heavily in recent state elections and a 
decision to replace the aging missiles with new weapons would be 
unpopular with voters in west germany where the current missiles 
are deployed and where the new ones would also be located 
genscher has repeatedly called for early talks with the warsaw 
pact to reduce the number of shortrange missiles 
the united states and britian are strongly opposed to early 
talks contending that warsaw pact superiority in conventional 
weapons requires a western nuclear deterrent of shortrange weapons 
a twoday meeting of nato defense ministers that ended thursday 
in brussels sidestepped the issue 
government sources said that during the coalition talks leaders 
of bavarias conservative christian social union party agreed to 
drop their longstanding opposition to early talks on shortrange 
missiles 
the position paper also reiterates kohls view that a west 
german decision on deployment of the modernized weapons is not 
necessary until 1991 or 1992 
the policy document urges the united states and the soviet union 
to negotiate on reduction of the missiles during the interim 
foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said the ruling 
coalition parties agreed on the common stand on the missile issue 
during an intensive round of talks in bonn late thursday 
chrobog refused to give details until nato allies had been 
informed of the results of the talks 
government spokesman hans klein said kohl had telephoned 
president bush on friday to inform him of the west german position 
he refused to elaborate 
during the nato meeting that ended thursday the united states 
and britain sought strong backing for plans to modernize the 
arsenal while several european nations pressed for early 
negotiations with the sovietled warsaw pact to reduce the missiles 
the may 2930 summit in brussels is scheduled to discuss a 
blueprint for the 16nation natos future arms control strategy and 
will have to tackle some of the modernization issues the allies 
skipped over this week 
a senior us official said friday in brussels that nato may 
fail to resolve in the coming weeks its deep differences over 
missile negotiations with the east bloc 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity raised the 
possibility that nato members would not reach a common position in 
time for the may summit 
we may in fact find ourselves at the summit with still 
serious genuine differences and in that case they may not be able 
to be bridged he said 
such an outcome probably would lead to speculation about 
disarray in the western alliance the nations are struggling to 
present a united front in the face of defense cut promises by 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev that have wide public appeal 
the current missiles have a range of a more than 60 miles 
the upgraded missiles would be extended to more than 250 miles 
just under the limits of the 1987 ussoviet treaty that 
eliminated intermediaterange nuclear missiles in europe the 
treaty covered missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3000 miles

the associated press and nine other news 
organizations friday sought to intervene in oliver norths criminal 
case in an effort to gain the release of a document that refers to 
intelligence intercepts in the irancontra affair 
the news organizations want a court hearing on their motion for 
access to a stipulation summarizing intelligence showing that top 
reagan administration officials knew at the time that a november 
1985 shipment to iran contained hawk missiles 
north lawyer brendan sullivan read portions of the stipulation 
in closing arguments wednesday in us district court but the 
document wasnt publicly released 
the first amendment the common law privilege of access to 
judicial records the classified information procedures act and the 
local rules of this court each requires that the public and press 
to be provided access to this document said the news 
organizations 
sullivans remarks from the stipulation apparently have been 
deleted from the transcript of the closing argument and the news 
organizations asked for access to a complete transcript 
the extent of contemporaneous knowledge by united states 
government officials of this arms shipment and of later attempts 
to cover up such knowledge has long been a major focus of 
attention in the overall irancontra affair said the filing in 
us district court 
in his closing arguments sullivan said the stipulation had been 
reached with the government about what 168 intercepts which 
remain classified showed and to whom they were distributed by 
special courier 
those receiving the intercepts were cia director william casey 
deputy national security adviser john poindexter secretary of 
defense caspar weinberger and national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane and others 
sullivan said the intercepts showed that officials knew at the 
time that missiles were shipped and even what ocean they were over 
at a particular time and when they got there 
the intercepts remain classified and the court has refused to 
make the stipulation available saying it is for jurors eyes only 
said the court filing by the news organizations the jury in the 
north case began deliberations friday 
north is accused of compiling a false chronology in november 
1986 which said that no one in the us government knew until 
january 1986 that the november 1985 shipment contained hawk 
missiles north attended a nov 20 1986 meeting with casey and 
poindexter and north testified that neither man indicated knowledge 
that hawk missiles had been aboard the iranbound aircraft

on april 22 1889 more than 40000 hopeful settlers converged 
on the borders of the 2 millionacre unassigned lands in what is 
now central oklahoma 
but in oklahoma city 25 miles to the south native americans at 
a capitol steps rally were told that they should no more celebrate 
the centennial of the run than jews should celebrate the holocaust 
it offends me that indian tax dollars are going to promote 
this celebration said frances wise director of oklahoma citys 
native american center 
the only time the state of oklahoma tries to be nice to us 
is when they want us to sing and dance for them she said 
president benjamin harrison authorized white settlement of the 
former indian land the result was a mad dash for 160acre parcels 
and town lots in what was called harrisons hoss race 
oklahomans trace their states roots to the run of 89 at noon 
on that april 22nd 
it was the first in a series of land openings rushes 
lotteries allotments and biddings that paved the way for 
oklahoma to become the 46th state in 1907 
guthrie served as the states capital until 1910 and its 
architecture has remained largely frozen in the victorian era some 
40 blocks of the town of 10000 is in the national register of 
historic places

carl sachs guthrie economic development director i dont think 
theres anything we can do to stop it now 
in oklahoma city an estimated 10000 people lined downtown 
streets friday afternoon to cheer high school bands waving 
politicians and centennial parade floats 
both guthrie and oklahoma city sprang fullgrown from the 
prairie as tent cities of 10000 on the day of the run which 
settled part or all of six counties

culminated in a fivemile march through downtown oklahoma city

some of the marchers wore black armbands and many wore tshirts 
proclaiming sooners run over indian nation other tshirts had 
a picture of a covered wagon and the slogan there goes the

the nations peace movement is at a difficult 
juncture as concerns over the environment aids and the homeless 
overshadow powderkegs like the middle east south africa and 
central america a new report concludes 
despite shifting attentions peace activism has become a 
national institution having consolidated power and influence in 
the arms control establishment and in citizens groups throughout 
the country the report says 
the next challenge says the inaugural issue of what will be a 
yearly report is to meld peace activism with the changing issues 
of the 1990s with the vietnam war a distant memory and the soviet 
union a lessening threat 
our task now is make policymakers realize the cold war is 
winding down said john tirman editor of the annual review of 
peace activism and head of the bostonbased winston foundation for 
world peace 
the kind of bitter ideological military confrontation that 
has marked the last 40 years is dissipating were trying to 
develop a more positive vision of change 
the report has 15 essays by political scientists activists and 
environmentalists on such topics as the plutonium challenge in 
the american west the human rights challenge and the 
battle for nuclear age education 
since its inception in the mid1960s during the vietnam war the 
peace movement has gone through two distinct stages tirman said 
the youthoriented activism of the vietnam era lasted until about 
1973 he said 
but when people began turning their attention to the environment 
and womens issues the peace movement waned the movement was not 
revived until thenpresident jimmy carters decision to build and 
deploy the mx missile in 1979 and later president reagans 
description of the soviet union as the evil empire 
the peace movements image must stay in step with the times or 
risk losing touch with issues of international security and the 
environment that threaten the country as much as the vietnam war 
two decades ago tirman said 
until 1986 this movement was basically in opposition to 
something tirman said now were in a state of flux we need 
to address other issues like the fact that the us is being left 
with a 300 billion defense budget at a time when gorbachev is 
ahead of us in making concessions 
though still predominantly a white middle class movement 
peace activism has claimed a more diverse membership in recent 
years 
its everyone from homemakers concerned about what their 
children eat to businessmen and women angry at the amount of waste 
in the pentagon to people who are just plain angry about the 
nuclear war said tirman 
as a result the peace movement has helped shape policy more 
effectively than in the past tirman said 
tirman credits the peace movement with reagans decision to sign 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty although some 
contributors to the report say peace activism in the 1980s was only 
moderately successful 
in the end the peace movement of the reagan era had to settle 
for indirect influence and partial success writes pam solo in a 
review article entitled the reagan era the freeze campaign and 
political power 
more than 50 million is donated toward the peace movement every 
year according to the report there are more than 50 research 
organizations and about 7300 smaller groups dedicated to the peace 
movement

hundreds of rioters smashed bank windows 
looted buildings and pelted police officers with rocks friday as 
riots caused by price increases spread to northern jordan 
troops banned moslems from weekly prayers in troubled southern 
cities in an attempt to prevent more unrest which has killed eight 
people 
king hussein visiting washington canceled a trip to britain 
scheduled to begin saturday and planned to return to jordan the 
jordanian embassy in london said 
in salt a city of 100000 12 miles north of amman children 
played inside shattered offices and hundreds of people milled 
around on the glassstrewn streets 
demonstrators called for the ouster of prime minister zaid 
rifai whom they blame for austerity measures and declining living 
standards they shouted support for hussein 
we are fed up with this government they have stolen all our 
money said a man in his 60s who refused to give his name he 
said demonstrators trust the kings leadership and we know he 
will respond 
riots also occurred thursday night in the northern towns of 
madaba and tayyba 
it was the first time disturbances had spread beyond the south 
since the unrest began tuesday in the southern city of maan the 
demonstrations came in response to price increases of 10 percent to 
50 percent on gasoline cigarettes heating oil and other 
commodities 
the increases were imposed sunday as part of an agreement with 
the international monetary fund to reschedule jordans 6 billion 
foreign debt they came on top of rising unemployment and soaring 
inflation 
residents of maan and other southern cities said soldiers 
prevented people from attending friday prayers at mosques 
cancellation of friday prayers is highly unusual in an islamic 
country 
the koran islams holy book calls on moslems to participate in 
the ceremony and most take it as a binding duty 
government officials earlier had hinted that moslem 
fundamentalists had inflamed the unrest the worst domestic 
violence since the 197071 war between the army and palestine 
liberation organization guerrillas 
most of the rioting has involved native jordanians not the 
palestinian half of the population 
an official statement read on staterun radio said four 
civilians and one policeman had died in maan and it blamed the 
deaths on shootings by the rioters 
residents of the city earlier had blamed the civilian deaths on 
the army although they said rioters also were firing weapons 
three other people were reported killed in mazar 55 miles south 
of amman 
staterun jordan television broadcast an appeal to jordanians 
friday night to end the violence for the first time showing 
pictures of smashed buildings and destroyed vehicles 
these are the services which the government tried to provide 
for the whole country and we paid with our tears and with our sweat 
and with our blood to have them built said mohammed amin the 
jordan television director who narrated the 20minute program 
these were destroyed by a bunch of terrorists 
he said because of the damage we will not pass this stage of 
economic difficulty as quickly as we thought because now we have 
added pressure 
israeli radio and tv were reporting the difficulties to 
instigate problems he said and news agencies are exaggerating 
the picture of the situation 
about 1000 people demonstrated thursday night in tayyba a town 
40 miles northwest of amman 
mayor mahmoud awneh said rioters smashed windows in a school and 
the town hall he denounced the riot but also criticized the price 
rises 
they shouldnt have raised the prices so much he said 
they should have increased them slowly when you do it 50 
percent the people cant afford it 
relatives of communist party members said government agents 
arrested about 100 party members overnight after the party 
distributed a leaflet demanding the government scrap the price 
rises and cancel its austerity plan 
the government as is common made no report of the arrests

a huge c130 cargo plane carrying 15 
tons of corn landed in the southern sudanese city of torit on 
friday as the united nations started up relief operations after a 
deadly ambush caused a threeday delay 
paul mitchell a spokesman for the united nations operation 
lifeline sudan told the associated press the plane arrived safely 
in the beleaguered town after leaving ugandas entebbe airport 
before dawn 
a 47truck relief convoy carrying 1100 tons to southern sudan 
also began friday with the first trucks rolling out of kampala 
before noon said gote hertz a un spokesman in kampala 
mitchell said the c130 leased from and operated by the 
miamibased southern air transport company will make three flights 
daily to torit until it has delivered 1100 tons 
the airlift and convoy are part of a massive 132 million un 
effort to stock more than 110000 tons of food and supplies in 
wartorn southern sudan before heavy seasonal rains begin in four 
weeks 
the operation hopes to avoid a repetition of last years 
tragedy when up to 500000 people died of famine induced by 
drought floods and a rebellion by the sudan peoples liberation 
army 
the liberation army began its rebellion in early 1983 demanding 
greater autonomy and economic reforms in the three southern 
provinces of bahr ghazal upper nile and equatoria 
the first un convoy in rebelheld southern sudan was ambushed 
on tuesday as it traveled west to torit from the sudan peoples 
liberation army base of kapoeta eight rebel escorts were killed 
and the lead truck was destroyed un officials have not assessed 
blame but suspicion fell on tribal raiders government troops or 
government militias fighting the rebels 
mitchell said fridays flight represented the start of the first 
significant shipment of relief food to torit the norwegian 
peoples aid and world vision relief agencies have delivered just 
under 100 tons to torit since april 1 he said 
the c130 until tuesday was one of two planes carrying food into 
the southern sudanese provincial capital of juba which is 
continuing to receive 55 tons of relief supplies daily on the 
remaining c130 said hertz 
he said the truck convoy will head first to the sudanese border 
town of nimule and leave perhaps 110 tons of food and supplies for 
an unknown number of displaced people there said hertz 
from nimule it will continue on to torit only if convoy leaders 
believe conditions are safe and no threat exists of land mines 
along the route he said 
in recent weeks torits civilian population swelled from 3000 
to 25000 as displaced southerners pour in from the surrounding 
bush un officials expect the population to climb to 50000 in 
the coming weeks

transportation secretary samuel skinner set 
out friday for europe on a quest to improve international aviation 
security while rejecting calls from victims of the pan am flight 
103 bombing for a broad investigation into the incident 
my job is to get this problem solved and to put the best most 
effective program of antiterrorism into place skinner said in a 
statement prior to his departure for naples italy aboard a 
federal aviation administration plane 
skinner is to meet during the weekend with the administrations 
nominee for faa administrator adm james b busey who is us 
navy commander for europe the secretary is meeting next week with 
government and airline officials in italy west germany 
switzerland france and england to push for security initiatives he 
said would encourage international travelers to retain their 
justified confidence in the systems safety 
skinner in a news conference for foreign journalists covering 
washington said us carriers have given unbelievable 
attention to security and are the safest in the world 
his spokesman david prosperi said skinner and other 
transportation and security officials were flying most of the way 
on a government plane to meet a tight schedule but would likely 
make at least part of the trip aboard a commercial airline 
skinner in a letter friday to the brother of one of the 270 
people killed in the pan am explosion over scotland said president 
bush had rejected the relatives request that he appoint an 
independent commission to investigate the dec 21 bombing 
for a variety of reasons we do not believe formation of an 
independent commission is necessary or prudent said skinner in 
the letter to bert ammerman which was accompanied by a fivepage 
outline of administration action since the pan am explosion 
ammerman of demarest nj said in a telephone interview the 
victims families still believe there is enough evidence to justify 
a full investigation by congress among concerns of the relatives 
of 200 americans killed in the bombing are the lack of a public 
warning of threats against the flight security procedures that 
failed to detect the plastic explosive which authorities say was 
believed planted by terrorists and inadequate government response 
after the incident 
ammerman said he met recently with secretary of state james 
baker iii and received assurances that relatives will receive 
better treatment than they have including state department escorts 
for those who visit the town of lockerbie scotland where the 
plane went down 
prosperi said skinner had no plan to go to lockerbie during his 
european visit 
skinner said he had confidence in the investigation by scottish 
and west german authorities and the fbi and believed those 
responsible for planting the bomb which investigators have said 
was hidden in a radiocassette will be apprehended and prosecuted 
i can assure you that in my opinion the investigation is 
moving at full speed skinner said i think that eventually and 
hopefully in the not too distant future the public will know the 
full story there he said it was important not to disclose 
targets of the investigation or the information being sought 
skinner said his trip would review screening given foreign 
nationals hired by us airlines abroad and seek diplomatic 
approval for installation of devices to detect plastic explosives 
in airports used by us carriers abroad 
the secretary said he has no evidence that large numbers of 
government employees cancelled reservations on flight 103 after a 
notice of a terrorist threat against us carriers was erroneously 
posted in the us embassy in moscow 
in both the news conference and documents sent to ammerman he 
reiterated the policy that if theres a significant enough threat 
to advise government employees the american public will be 
advised 
he noted that several government employees were among those 
killed

the no 1 suspect in 12 drugrelated 
torture slayings near agua prieta mexico was in us custody 
friday awaiting extradition or deportation border patrol 
officials said 
hector fragoso burgueno 45 was arrested late thursday at a 
mobile home in an isolated desert area south of three points a 
small community about 30 miles west of tucson pima county sheriff 
clarence dupnik said 
like the ritual slayings of 15 people in matamoros discovered 
last week authorities consider the agua prieta ranch killings to 
be drugrelated 
fragoso who owned the ranch where the bodies were found last 
month had shaved his moustache changed his hair style and altered 
his eyebrows but he was readily identifiable said pima county 
sheriffs maj dennis douglas 
enrique cecena zone commander with the sonora state judicial 
police said the sonora attorney generals office will file the 
formal request for fragosos return to mexico that us authorities 
said they were awaiting 
hes the principal one according to the witnesses cecena 
said from nogales mexico 
scott coffin deputy chief agent for the border patrol in 
tucson said fragoso was being held as an illegal alien under a 
federal immigration arrest warrant on administrative charges 
authorities have not yet decided on whether extradition or 
deportation proceedings would be the best way to return fragosa to 
mexico said border patrol spokesman ed pyeatt 
douglas and the drug enforcement administration said fragoso and 
the agua prieta slayings may be linked to the torture and stabbing 
deaths of two men from arizona and three from sonora whose bodies 
were found in a tucson shed shortly before the agua prieta bodies 
were discovered 
tucson homicide detectives have declined comment on that point 
however dupnik said tucsons homicide detail was among officers at 
the arrest site 
douglas said investigators developed leads on fragosos 
whereabouts through various tips including a local crime hotline 
calls to the television show americas most wanted and 
confidential sources 
the tv show aired a segment on fragoso last week that prompted 
116 phone calls douglas said he said the show was a building 
block in our investigation but not a principal factor in finding 
fragoso 
a woman taken into custody with fragoso was listed in a dea 
statement as anna marie fregosa and described as his wife but 
border patrol and sheriffs officials said they did not have the 
womans identification and that her relationship was unclear 
the dea said she will be deported voluntarily to mexico 
various reports had described fragoso as a united states 
citizen but coffin said all the evidence in fragosos file 
pointed to his being a mexican citizen 
the 12 agua prieta victims included nine who were found march 29 
and three others found april 12 all at the ranch two miles west of 
the sonoran border city directly across from douglas some of the 
mutilated bodies had been dumped in a well others were buried in a 
septic tank 
cecena said 11 of the victims apparently were killed after they 
witnessed the murder of another person 
fragoso described by mexican police as a drug trafficker also 
is known as tombstone for whats alleged to be his practice of 
burying competitors authorities say he may have been the enforcer 
for a drug ring called los tios the uncles 
the dea said it first became aware of fragoso when he was 
arrested in 1974 for possession of 2400 pounds of marijuana he 
was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison he escaped in 
january 1978 but was recaptured the following march in safford the 
dea said 
while in jail fragoso was convicted of assault on a federal 
officer the dea said he was released in the early 1980s but 
subsequently was arrested in the united states on charges of rape 
and armed robbery the dea said without giving the outcome of those 
cases

house speaker jim wrights wife gave 
important investment advice to the local partnership targeted in a 
house ethics committee inquiry of wright chief partner george 
mallick says 
she earned her money mallick told the fort worth 
startelegram in an interview published friday she was a 
bonafide employee 
the speaker faces 69 allegations of house rules violations 
brought by the ethics committee among the accusations is that his 
wife betty was paid an 18000ayear salary by mallick for work 
she did not do for the fort worthbased investment firm mallightco 
inc 
the ethics committees special counsel richard phelan said in 
a statement april 11 that betty wright had failed to document that 
she worked more than 12 days over a fouryear period for mallick 
an attorney for jim wright william oldaker said he presented 
specific testimony that she worked five to seven days a month 
in an interview in the washington post published friday mrs 
wright said the firm was a a piddling little momandpop 
operation and she never kept any records of her work 
mallick however said mrs wright was an integral part of the 
decisionmaking when mallightco was considering investments 
in one instance mallick said he changed his mind on her advice 
and decided against entering an oil company deal in which 
mallightco would have lost at least 25000 and maybe up to 
200000 
the house ethics committee is trying to determine whether 
mallick tried to influence legislation through his relationship to 
wright mallick said he never has 
ive never asked the speaker in the 30 years ive known him 
to vote one way or another on a piece of legislation he said 
he also said wright had no knowledge of a 1988 gas well 
investment in which mallightco turned a 340880 profit because the 
speaker had put his holdings in a blind trust in 1987 
mallick criticized phelans report saying he was convinced 
the report was written in the cycle of the full moon its 
lunacy 
in a separate interview wright told the startelegram that the 
ethics probe has been an agonizing experience and he never 
dreamed it would drag on this long 
i have tried to cultivate a quality of forgiveness i must not 
allow myself to be embittered against those who have said vicious 
things about me it isnt easy he said 
wright said he believes his detractors have engaged in more 
unethical behavior than anything he has been accused of 
the most unethical behavior ive observed by any colleague is 
the deliberate attempt to ruin another colleagues reputation 
wright said in an obvious reference to his republican foe rep

the pennsylvania lotterys super 7 jackpot 
reached an estimated world record of 70 million on friday and was 
expected to keep climbing through wednesdays drawing lottery 
officials said 
lottery spokeswoman terry murphy said sales are booming nearly 
7 million tickets were sold thursday and friday lottery officials 
will continue to update the value of the pot as sales continue she 
said 
im having a hard time just saying 70 million now she 
said i dont know where its going to end up we wont know that 
until thursday morning 
the total estimated from sales figures apparently broke a 
1weekold world record of 699 million set in illinois on april 
15 that was split by four ticket holders 
the super 7 jackpot was climbing to unprecedented heights 
because no one has bought a winning ticket for six weeks ms 
murphy said 
if one person gets a ticket with seven of the 11 winning numbers 
in the 70 million jackpot he or she would receive 269 million a 
year for 26 years 
prior to the illinois record the world record set last fall was 
a 6198 million jackpot split among buyers of three tickets in the

romanias former foreign minister 
corneliu manescu who denounced abuses in romania in a letter to 
president nicolae ceausescu is under house arrest and in critical 
condition a hungarian daily said friday 
in an article carried by the communist party newspaper 
nepszabadsag hungarian former foreign minister janos peter said 
the 73yearold manescu is also threatened with deportation from 
romania and a court trial 
peter said he learned about manescus problems from reliable 
sources he invited him to hungary for medical treatment and said 
he hoped romanian authorities would allow the visit out of 
humanitarian considerations 
manescu was romanias chief diplomat from 19611972 
he was one of six top romanian communists who wrote ceausescu 
last month demanding an immediate halt to food exports from 
shortageplagued romania they detailed other abuses such as 
forced sunday labor and systematic violations of private mail and 
telephone communications 
following publication of the letter in the west last month the 
signatories reported police harassment and threats of deportation 
and expulsion from the party if they dont recant on the letter 
i have been reliably informed that manescu is being kept short 
of food the news is particularly alarming since i know that he 
suffers from a grave constriction of vessels and has had a new 
attack of gastric ulcer nepszabadsag quoted peter as saying 
isolation even if it is only house arrest may cause his 
death it is no exaggeration to say that manescus life is in the 
balance

a united mine workers official said friday 
the union is expanding its violencemarred strike against the 
pittston coal group to companies that are aiding pittston 
weve decided it has come to a head said howard green an 
international board member from umw district 17 
the violence continued with rockthrowing at coaltruck convoys 
near pittston operations in russell county va virginia state 
police said 
state troopers arrested 29 people and charged most of them with 
throwing rocks at occupied vehicles said capt tom flanary 
commander of the state polices 4th division in wytheville 
also friday umw lawyers asked a logan county judge to bar 
pittston security guards from harassing union pickets that 
followed pittstons request that judge eric obriant limit the 
number of union pickets in the county 
about 1700 umw members have been on strike at pittston 
operations in virginia and west virginia since april 5 the union 
accused the company of unfair labor practices in negotiating a 
contract to replace one that expired 14 months ago pittston denies 
the charges and has been hiring replacement workers 
green told the charleston wva daily mail that the union will 
expand its 2weekold strike to any company that is supplying coal 
to pittston to help it fulfill its contracts 
were not going to sit idly by and watch companies fill orders 
for pittston he said if you supply a renegade company like 
pittston you will be considered a renegade yourself the word is 
going out 
green also said that action later could include other companies 
that have not signed a contract with the union green said as many 
as 150 miners could go on strike by next week 
at fridays hearing in logan county circuit court a union 
witness testified that he saw two pittston guards drive past a 
picket line with an uncased rifle or shotgun in the back seat 
other umw witnesses said pittston employees and guards sped past 
picket lines in one case coming within three feet of a union 
shack some witnesses said they thought they had been followed by 
the guards 
company lawyer john r woodrum said there was no evidence any 
guards or employees did anything wrong 
a day earlier lawyers for two pittston subsidiaries buffalo 
and elkay mining companies asked obriant to limit the umw to two 
pickets at a time the company contends that union members have 
intimidated and harassed its employees and workers from companies 
with which it does business 
a judge in russell county va last week rejected pittstons 
request that the union be limited to two pickets at more than 30 
sites but restricted the umw to 10 pickets at two mines 
about 40 umw wives earlier this week staged a sitin in the 
lobby of pittstons offices at lebanon va on thursday 35 
strikers were arrested after a coal truck convoy was hit by a 
barrage of rocks at pittsons moss no 3 coal preparation plant in 
russell county va 
in buchanan county va on thursday two miners attempting to 
leave the ramph mine a nonunion contract producer for pittston

wielded by one of several umw and nonunion miners picketing at the 
mine flanary said the driver suffered a head injury when the 
truck crashed

coretta scott king lamented a lack of unity 
among blacks and rep ron dellums blasted the budget priorities of 
the president and congress as the african american summit 89 
opened friday 
today we have more of what we fought for more 
africanamerican elected officials more educational opportunity 
more access to public accommodations said mrs king widow of 
martin luther king yet we have less unity than we had during the 
civil rights movement 
such unity must be regained if blacks are to overcome burgeoning 
poverty and rise to positions of power in business and politics 
she said in her opening speech to the summit the first such 
gathering since thenmayor richard hatcher helped organize one in 
gary ind in 1972 
hatcher is chairman of this conference called to develop a 
social and political agenda for blacks in the 1990s and deal with 
such issues as threats to the black family teenage pregnancy and 
drug abuse 
a panel discussion on criminal justice was to include angela 
davis an activist who gained renown in the 1970s with her arrest 
and acquittal on charges stemming from a 1970 shootout at the 
marion county courthouse in northern california 
dellums dcalif in his keynote speech before nearly 1000 
people said blacks must concern themselves not just with domestic 
problems but also with oppression and poverty that afflict blacks 
throughout the world 
and he chastised republican president george bush and the 
democratic leadership of the congress for this months 
muchheralded budget compromise 
most of the congress and as far as im concerned the 
executive branch have failed the moral test of what a national 
budget ought to be dellums said 
dellums chairman of the congressional black caucus said that 
groups own budget proposal would reduce the federal deficit by 
924 billion by placing a heavier tax burden on the wealthy and 
reducing the military budget while increasing spending to feed the 
poor improve schools and build homes 
we dont need mx missiles and midgetman and trident missiles 
and b2 bombers and star wars said dellums you cant feed 
anybody with it you cant educate anybody with it you cant 
create housing with it its madness 
in welcoming participants to the summit hatcher made an oblique 
reference to the absence of national black republican chairman fred 
brown of new york who last month withdrew after organizers 
extended invitations to davis and black muslim leader louis 
farrakhan who did not attend 
this isnt about the people who arent here hatcher said 
it is about the people who are here 
hatcher said he regretted the republican leaders absence 
because his early help in the conference was valuable and he has 
something to offer that would certainly make this a better 
meeting 
fewer than 1000 people were in the hall for speeches by 
dellums mrs king and others but hatcher said he was not 
perturbed by the relatively low attendance 
it was the media that got into numbers he said the 
people that cared enough to come spend their own money if 
they cared enough to be here then let me tell you something my 
expectations have been met

the judge in a landmark aids lawsuit 
drastically reduced a 2175 million jury award to rock hudsons 
lover friday ruling that marc christian should receive only 55 
million 
superior court judge bruce geernaert called hudsons behavior 
outrageous and reprehensible for not telling his lover of his 
aids diagnosis but he said the jurys passion had led it to 
make an excessive award 
in his written ruling geernaert said that both the compensatory 
and punitive damages were excessive and he felt that the amounts he 
set were sufficient to compensate christian 
christians lawyer harold rhoden said his client was as 
disappointed as i am but christian later said he was delighted 
even at the prospect of getting less than a third of what the jury 
decided he should receive 
reached by telephone christian said he still felt he won 
because the judge had removed any reason for appeal on grounds of 
excessive damages 
its still a big award he said noting he never expected 
realistically to collect the larger figure 
it was more symbolic than anything else christian said 
adding he believed the 55 million award still sends the same 
message out that those with aids must warn their sex partners 
but robert parker mills the attorney for the hudson estate 
said he believes his clients probably will appeal 
theres not any evidence i can see that would substantiate a 
5 million award to this man said mills 
the judge said he had given the matter much thought since an 
earlier hearing when he suggested a figure of 3 million in 
punitive damages 
upon further reflection in light of the entire record a 
punitive damage award of 500000 seems to fairly accomodate 
the pertinent factors geernaert said he set compensatory 
damages at 5 million 
geenaert specified that these reductions would go into effect 
only if christian accepts them if he does not consent geernaert 
said he would order a new trial on damages 
the court finds that the jurys award of 145 million in 
compensatory damages is so high that it must be concluded that the 
award is based in part on passion resulting from the jurys 
evaluation of the outrageous and reprehensible nature of the 
conduct of rock hudson and defendant hudson secretary mark 
miller the judge said 
he added that substantial evidence supported christians claim 
of enhanced fear of contracting aids after he learned that hudson 
had the disease 
on the other hand however serious plaintiffs distress might 
be when he first learned of hudsons aids such emotional distress 
would become somewhat less over time the judge said 
furthermore there is no evidence that plaintiffs emotional 
distress has been physically debilitating or that plaintiff has 
suffered any tangible economic loss 
lawyers for hudsons estate tried to show during the often lurid 
trial testimony that christians affair with hudson was over by the 
time the stars disease was discovered hudson died at age 58 on 
oct 5 1985 
the jury rejected that argument and decided in february that 
hudson was guilty of outrageous conduct for concealing his aids 
diagnosis from christian his lover for two years christian said 
he didnt learn of the stars illness until a few months before 
hudson died 
the jury awarded christian 145 million compensatory damages 
and 725 million in punitive damages to compensate for the fear he 
suffered 
i thought i was a dead man he testified 
although christian did not contract aids and has tested negative 
for the virus the judge and jury found he deserved damages a 
ruling unique in personal injury law on sexually transmitted 
diseases in previous cases only plaintiffs who developed the 
diseases have collected damages 
miller hudsons secretary also was found liable for damages 
the jury said he conspired with the actor to keep christian in the 
dark about the aids diagnosis so that the younger man would 
continue to engage in sex with hudson the jury assessed 725 
million in punitive damages against miller alone since an estate 
cannot be held liable for such damages which are intended to 
punish and set an example 
in papers filed in recent days the hudson estate lawyers had 
urged the judge to give christian no more than 1 million and as 
little as 100000 lawyers for miller insisted that christian is 
entitled to no punitive damages

plans are being laid for the 20th 
anniversary of the woodstock festival but community leaders here 
are not excited at the prospect of being included in any 
commemoration of peace love and rock n roll 
the new york festival in august 1969 came to symbolize the 1960s 
for a generation of americans but for some people here 50 miles 
north of chicago woodstock evokes thoughts of trouble 
this is a small midvictorian town thats trying to stay that 
way said mayor jim shoemaker 
weve had a lot of events where there was a goodsized number 
of people but they were ones that we planned ones the town 
wanted he said thursday night 
we dont go too much for these prepackaged things were they 
add water mix it up and serve it to you 
wckgfm a chicago radio station that plays classic rock has 
hired a company to plan a twoday anniversay festival one of 
several planned around the country 
the mchenry county fairgrounds part of which lies in woodstock 
population 15000 is one of eight sites being considered for the 
wckg event said tom drilias vice president of festival events 
inc 
organizers hope to attract 25000 people to hear singers on 
three stages perform folk and rock music of the late 1960s there 
would be arts and crafts displays carnival rides food booths and 
beer tents 
the original threeday peace and love fest held on a farm near 
woodstock in upstate new york drew some 300000 people who swayed 
to the sounds of jimi hendrix joan baez sly and the family stone 
the who and others 
the event was plagued by heavy rain lack of food and sanitation 
facilities drug overdoses and massive traffic jams 
i think its the memory of 20 years ago that makes people say 
we dont want that here shoemaker said 
some local merchants however would welcome the visitors 
being a small carryout the business would be appreciated 
said kathy dugas who owns ma bills snack spot on the town square 
to hold such an event organizers would be required to get 
permits from the county 
i dont think theyve got too much of a chance shoemaker

a brain disorder might explain the crimes 
a glum unshaven shackled ramon salcido wearing an orange jail 
jumpsuit was charged with seven counts of murder and three counts 
of attempted murder in the april 14 killing spree prosecutors said 
they would seek the death penalty 
his court appearance came a day after an enraged mob greeted his 
arrival from mexico with shouts of kill him and picket signs 
supporting capital punishment 
salcido delayed entering a plea and was ordered back to court 
may 5 he was returned to sonoma county jail where he will remain 
under heavy guard and a suicide watch 
judge knoel owen granted the prosecutions request for a gag 
order on lawyers involved in the case the order bars officials 
from talking about the case with the exception of referring without 
comment to public records 
before the order issued sonoma county district attorney gene 
tunney said prosecutors would seek the death penalty he discounted 
speculation that salcidos alleged rampage was fueled in part by a 
twoday binge on alcohol and cocaine 
he also said he believed salcido is legally sane the final 
decision about his state of mind will be made in court he said 
those the slayings were not the acts of an irrational 
berserker 
sonoma county chief public defender marteen miller said he will 
have salcido undergo psychiatric and neurological tests i expect 
to find some brain lesion or tumor he said calling the crimes 
so bizarre so incomprehensible 
god i hope i find something miller said 
miller said the cost of the trial would be 3 million to 4 
million and said he would seek a change of venue to orange san 
diego or los angeles county 
a widespread manhunt that began after the killings friday and 
saturday ended wednesday when salcido was arrested in western 
mexico near his hometown of los mochis he was brought to mexico 
city on thursday afternoon deported by mexico and returned to 
california 
the 28yearold forklift driver was whisked into the county jail 
thursday night smiling slightly as 200 people waiting outside 
shouted kill him inside he was kept under a suicide watch 
officials said 
signs reading yes on capital punishment and salcido 
doesnt deserve to live greeted him upon his return at sonoma 
county airport 
i want to see him tortured i think he deserves it what he 
did to those kids douglas drake 28 of santa rosa said friday 
adding that he thought it would be appropriate to skin salcido 
alive 
shawn kennedy 19 the mother of two young children said 
salcido doesnt deserve a trial and added that she would pull the 
switch on the electric chair i wouldnt even hesitate if they 
asked me to do that she said 
sheriffs officials said salcido was held in a maximumsecurity 
cell isolated from other inmates 
with this type of prisoner you have a threat from other 
inmates said reserve sheriffs deputy john childers 
salcido told mexican television reporters and law enforcement 
agents he killed his americanborn wife angela 24 and a winery 
coworker tracy toovey in a jealous rage believing toovey and 
his wife were romantically involved according to federal officials 
its ludicrous said the rev rich gantenbein a family 
friend who led a memorial service for toovey ramon has created 
his own hell and now hes trying to drag everyone into it 
also killed in a brutal shooting and slashing spree were 
salcidos motherinlaw his two sistersinlaw and two of his 
young daughters the two sistersinlaw 8 and 12 also were raped 
and sodomized and one was nearly decapitated 
his daughter carmina who turns 3 on monday is recovering from 
a slashed throat she and the bodies of her sisters 1 and 4 were 
found saturday at a sonoma county dump carmina identified her 
father as their attacker authorities said 
additional murder charges will depend on whether lab tests show 
that salcido was at the home of his motherinlaw and her young 
children when they died tunney said

strikeravaged eastern airlines on friday 
dropped a program of rewarding new york taxicab drivers for 
steering passengers toward its northeast shuttle service at 
laguardia airport 
the incentive campaign which started about two weeks ago was 
stopped after new yorks taxi and limousine commission told eastern 
it was against all rules 
ellen weiman a spokeswoman for the commission said taxi 
drivers shouldnt be induced to take riders where they dont want 
to go 
once it was brought to our attention it was discontinued 
said jim ashlock an eastern spokesman in miami 
eastern was giving cabbies a 25 american express certificate 
for every five loads of passengers they dropped off at easterns 
shuttle terminal at laguardia 
there was also a weekly drawing for participating taxi drivers 
for a color television set videocassette recorder or radio 
wed like to think that maybe the cabbies are doing some 
selling for us eastern spokesman robin matell said earlier 
friday he noted that around half the passengers coming to 
laguardia arrive by taxi 
easterns hourly shuttle linking new york with boston and 
washington has been running a normal schedule compared with only 
10 percent of prestrike flights for the airline as a whole 
passenger loads have been decimated however as the rival shuttle 
operated by pan am corp has eaten into easterns traffic 
pan am once used an incentive plan to encourage cabbies to pick 
up arriving passengers at its new york terminal when the airline 
started a shuttle service in late 1986 spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
said but the program wasnt illegal 
she said the airline has captured around 80 percent of the 
northeast shuttle market and easterns taxi program appears to 
have had no impact 
in another development a washington property developer 
confirmed through an associate friday that he is interested in 
buying eastern 
weve expressed our interest its sincere and were pursuing 
it said john sarpa senior vice president of hadid development 
co in roslyn va the company is run by mohamed hadid who 
recently agreed to buy the ritzcarlton hotels in washington and 
new york 
attorneys for eastern and its striking unions recently said 
there are four serious offers for the airline which has been 
grounded by a walkout since march 4 it filed for bankruptcy 
protection five days later 
they said the bidders are exbaseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth whose 464 million deal to buy eastern collapsed last 
week takeover strategist carl icahn billionaire hotel executive 
jay pritzker and an unnamed suitor 
but frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parents texas air corp 
insisted earlier this week that eastern isnt for sale and that 
there is no serious fourth bidder

about 10000 gallons of oiltainted 
water spilled friday into a stream feeding the lush atchafalaya 
basin as a barge was being unloaded at a waste disposal site 
authorities said 
the barge carrying 900000 gallons of wastewater from an exxon 
plant in houston buckled in the middle after an estimated 280000 
gallons had been siphoned into tanker trucks said spokesman bobby 
mayweather of gsx land treatment of white castle 
it looked like a giant had stepped on the barge smack in the 
middle said state police lt ronnie jones 
state police originally estimated the spill at up to 400000 
gallons while gsx said their estimate was 180000 exxon 
spokeswoman jill johnson in dallas later downgraded the spill to 
about 10000 gallons 
no one was injured in the accident but ms johnson said a small 
number of fish were killed at the outset the waste according to 
exxon was 90 percent water 7 percent alcohol and 3 percent light 
oil said jones 
the spill occurred at a remote area about 35 miles southwest of 
baton rouge on the edge of the atchafalaya basin a vast hardwood 
swamp and marshland that is a breeding ground for a variety of fish 
and wildlife 
iberville parish sheriff freddie pitre said he believed the 
tanker truck crew had siphoned the waste from the front and rear 
ends of the 300footlong barge leaving most of the weight in the 
middle 
oilabsorbing booms were in place shortly after the spill and 
we believe most of the waste was confined to the immediate area of 
grand river said jones we may not know tomorrow or even the 
next day if we got it all because there is no visible slick 
some of the waste could find its way into the basin but the 
spill is no disaster said jones 
things could have been an awful lot worse but because of the 
waste involved and the quick response by iberville parish 
officials weve got a good handle on the situation he said 
paul dubois a spokesman for the palmer co owner of the barge 
said the waste is commonly known in the oil industry as slop water 
used to wash out tanks and ships when its dirty with oil residue 
it becomes waste water he said 
gsx was paid by exxon to treat the nonhazardous waste and 
dispose of it in the companys land farm operation mayweather said 
the barge was leased by gsx and exxon had no responsibility for 
the barge after it left the texas site said pitre

the damaged battleship uss iowa steamed home 
from puerto rico on friday while investigators on board interviewed 
crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that 
killed 47 sailors 
ens karl johnson an atlantic fleet spokesman said the navy 
would not release the exact position of the ship which was 
expected to reach its home port here about 530 pm sunday 
the washington post reported in its saturday editions that 
crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the 
explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below 
suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces 
navy investigators also said the explosion left two fully loaded 
gun barrels in the turret the newspaper reported 
the explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded 
and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire 
the center gun the newspaper said 
after the fire was extinguished crew men worked quickly to 
remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they 
could explode the newspaper said 
meanwhile nbc news reported that the exact cause of the blast 
in one of the ships three 16inch gun turrets on wednesday may 
never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so 
complete 
the navy released photographs of the firefighting effort which 
authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool 
off the turret before anyone could enter it 
during the trip home investigators on board were reviewing a 
videotape of the turret taken by an iowa officer who had wanted to 
record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred said 
lt cmdr james cudler a pentagon spokesman he said the 
investigators had not decided whether to release the tape to the 
public investigators were also interviewing crew members 
maj tom johnston a spokesman for the atlantic fleet in 
norfolk said he had no information on the cause of death of the 47 
crewmennavy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of 
the explosion 
in norfolk memorial services for the 47 victims are tentatively 
set for 9 am monday president george bush is to attend 
johnson said the ship is steaming under its own power and 
repeated the navys daily report that the ship is seaworthy and in 
no danger 
the 887foot 58000ton battleship has armor up to 17 inches 
thick navy officials have said that the explosion in the no 2 gun 
turret damaged only the turret 
the top members of the senate armed services committee said 
friday the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion 
the explosion occurred during open seas gun practice 300 miles 
north of puerto rico the pentagon said the blast ripped through 
the middle gun of the threegun turret and that that gun had not 
been fired prior to the explosion 
the pentagon has ordered that no 16inch gun will be fired until 
the investigation is complete ships with those guns the 
battleships iowa new jersey missouri and wisconsin were built 
during world war ii some critics have said the 16inch guns are 
outmoded and dangerous

school officials across the country are being 
advised to test for radon after the federal government found 
unhealthy levels of the odorless cancercausing gas in half the 
schools examined in spot checks from maine to washington state 
based on measurements taken in 3000 schoolrooms in 16 states 
it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found in 
schools throughout the united states epa administrator william 
k reilly said thursday 
he called indoor radon which is emitted from natural 
radioactive decay in the ground one of the major environmental 
health threats facing americans and urged that officials 
nationwide test their schoolrooms for the gas 
the epa which last year issued a similar warning to homeowners 
after a spot check around the country said that of 130 public 
schools tested in 41 communities 54 percent of the schools had at 
least one room normally occupied by students or staff that 
registered unhealthy levels of radon

sound appetizing but when tossed with a salad churned up in 
tomato sauce or baked in bread theyre not bad at all the 
government says 
the food and drug administration says that though vermin and 
their residues are aesthetically unpleasing within prescribed 
limits they are harmless natural and unavoidable in food 
under fda standards for example 35 ounces of tomato sauce can 
have up to 30 fly eggs 11 ounces of wheat flour can have up to 450 
insect fragments and a half pound of canned or frozen spinach can 
have as many as 100 aphids and a pound of cocoa beans can contain

raided japan leaving business leaders suspicious and wondering 
whether americans like him want to buy their companies just as the 
japanese have done in the united states 
however the difficulties the texas oilman has encountered with 
the subtleties and intricities of japanese business suggest pickens 
himself is far from being a threat to japans leading companies 
pickens has purchased shares worth about 1 billion in koito 
manufacturing co a major auto parts maker surpassing toyota 
motor to become the largest shareholder but despite owning 202 
percent of koito its management politely turned down pickens 
request this week for a seat on the board of directors 
it is necessary to build a trusting relationship first in 
japan it is not possible to just say im a major shareholder 
and get a seat on the board right away koito director tamotsu

the north and south both are losing the 
modernday battle of gettysburg 
the monuments that make the rolling hills one of the worlds 
largest outdoor museums are melting every time rain drips from the 
marble and bronze memorials acid slowly but steadily washes away 
pieces of history 
the marble ones are definitely on their way to destruction 
said david ballard maintenance director at gettysburg national 
military park you can wax bronze but there isnt a lot you 
can do about marble the marbles just going to keep on fizzing 
away 
only granite markers and monument bases seem immune across the 
sprawling battlefield the effects of acid rain are obvious to even 
a casual observer brass plaques are stained and streaked with 
corrosion in shades of black gray green and white marble markers 
are badly pitted and misshapen 
on cemetery ridge the high ground that union forces held on the 
decisive third day of the 1863 civil war battle ballard gestured 
helplessly toward an octagonal marble marker inscriptions had been 
chiseled on all eight sides but only a stray letter or two remain 
visibile 
whatever the heck was here its gone now its history he 
said 
a short hike away in the cemetery where abraham lincoln 
delivered the gettysburg address is the first monument erected 
here the soldiers national monument whose dedication took up 
much of the front page of the new york times on july 2 1869 is 
probably the most endangered piece we have in the park right 
now ballard said 
the monument features a woman representing liberty atop a 
classical column which rests on a pedestal at the four corners of 
the pedestal sculpted marble figures represent war history peace 
and plenty damage from acid particles in rain isnt apparent at 
first because of the stark beauty of the work viewed as a whole a 
closer look reveals a missing toe here a washedout detail there 
ballard likened the damage to a melting ice cube which retains 
its general appearance for a while then collapses because it loses 
structural shape 
fighting the acidic effects of airborne pollution according to 
a draft national park service report is a losing battle 
only memories last forever in time metal corrodes and stone 
crumbles what worries park managers at gettysburg national 
military park is the speed with which our monuments to those 
honored dead are disappearing 
complicating ballards mission are two facts he cant control 
pennsylvania according to the state sierra club and pennsylvanians 
for acid rain control receives the most acidic rainfall in the 
united states and is one of the top three sources of sulfur 
dioxide environmentalists contend sulfur dioxide from coalfired 
power plants is a major cause of acid rain 
another constraint ballard faces is limited government funding 
both to deal with acid rain and maintain gettysburgs monuments 
asked if his crews could protect the 1300 monuments and major 
markers he replied not given the current state of funding in 
the park service it would take a crew of a dozen people perhaps 
working year round payroll costs alone would total 300000 he 
said 
park workers do what they can corrosion is removed from bronze 
with a pressurized stream of pulverized walnut shells the 
consistency of pepper then it is coated with a protective wax to 
be effective the coating should be done every year but funds and 
manpower dictate less frequent treatments here 
the work isnt cheap simply erecting scaffolding to repair 
acidrain damage to the pennsylvania monument the largest in the 
park cost 8000 it cost 2900 total to clean and wax a smaller 
minnesota monument 
environmentalists say the problem can be resolved by requiring 
industries to install equipment to reduce and control emissions 
we have the technological means the canadian coalition on 
acid rain said recently we know what we have to do to clean our 
air and we know how to do it weve studied enough weve 
gathered tons of scientific evidence and weve talked until were 
blue in the face 
at recent conference a joseph dowd of the american electric 
power service corp said congress shouldnt require industries to 
spend billions on pollution control devices unless it is quite 
clear that the resulting environmental benefits in the northeast 
and canada will exceed the cost 
ballard has steered clear of the political battle over acid 
rain but says something must be done before long or major 
monuments will be beyond repair its a real problem and the 
current solutions just arent good enough

in a tiny eightsided hut spiritual 
healer gladys reid turns on a cassette of soothing melodies with a 
brush of her hand she claims to whisk away tension and negative 
energy 
it wont be so easy to rid cassadaga of its woes say many 
residents of the backwoods enclave of more than 100 spiritualists 
who attest to psychic or prophetic powers and the ability to 
communicate with the deceased 
the friction of controversy and fear of change cling to this 
95yearold community like the spanish moss draping from the tree 
limbs in the ephemeral realm of spiritualism very material issues 
such as politics stock ownership and lawsuits jangle the villages 
almost surreal tranquillity 
if you look close you can feel the tension in the air said 
ron e heriff a professional medium who was among a fivecandidate 
slate that lost a bitter campaign march 25 to control the 
nonprofit board that runs cassadaga spiritualist camp which 
governs most psychic practitioners in town 
at least three of the five have been threatened with loss of 
their single share of camp stock for their alleged dissident acts 
and a legal challenge in volusia circuit court is expected to be 
heard sometime this spring on a plan that turned the camp from a 
shareholder to membership group 
leaders say the move was to protect against unqualified psychics 
using the camps name others claim it was an attempt to stifle new 
ideas and force nonconformists from lowcost camp homes 
meanwhile at the newly reopened cassadaga hotel a musty 
quaint 62yearold structure owner joseph stupar has filed suit 
against the camp board alleging harassment because he rents space 
to some of the two dozen spiritualists who operate outside the 
camps sanction 
all this bickering and lawsuits have drained the positive 
energy from this place said marilyn awtrysmith who lost her 
camp stock in december for forming a rival group in 1986 
the tension is very very high heriff said im not 
joking we may be witnessing the undoing of cassadaga 
premonitions are just one ingredient in the metaphysical montage 
of cassadaga there are those who acknowledge the healing powers of 
certain stones and crystals others comb the zodiac for insights 
and guidance auras are read and past lives are examined 
but the basic tenet of spiritualism remains the ability to speak 
with the socalled dead the contact with the spirit side is 
critical to demonstrate that death is not the end the messages 
from the afterlife can be anything from a subtle feeling to words 
scripted through the air by lightemitting trumpets 
look at it this way said medium and board member darleen 
misskelley you cant see television or radio waves in the air 
but you see an image or hear a voice on the radio well a medium 
is just like a television or radio we pick up the higher 
vibrations from the spirit side and translate it back to something 
we can understand 
cassadaga is a mecca for mediums signs hang from most of the 
woodframe houses offering different doors into the spirit world 
psychic counselors pastlife regressions astral therapy on gala 
days and mediums nights during the year the compound is abuzz 
with visitors seeking 15minute seances 
yet not all in the village are believers one camp shareholder 
rents to her sons who playfully erected a ghostbusters movie 
logo 
were not a circus or a sideshow said misskelley the 
daughter of a presbyterian deacon but some people cant 
appreciate that everyone mocked nancy reagan for seeking the 
advice of an astrologer when they know nothing about it 
the foundations of spiritualism in america began after the 
revolution when metaphysics and superstition often intertwined 
with everyday life one of the largest communities now known as 
lily dale was established in southwestern new york in 1879 at the 
same time george colby was homesteading here to establish a winter 
retreat for the northern cassadaga village 
none of colbys descendants are alive and vandals have burned 
and damaged his cabin yet his portrait is displayed like an icon 
there are also numerous pictures of jesus whom spiritualists 
regard as just one of the great healers and mediums followers are 
hunting for suitable pictures of other prophets including mohammed 
and buddha 
today all members of the camp compound must be approved by the 
board about a third of the 300 shareholders live in cassadaga 
where home prices are kept low most are less than 50000 and 
some of the longtime residents pay only 5 a year for a lease 
most make their living off readings averaging about 35 per 
session 
but in a community of avowed freethinkers its different ideas 
and approaches that have caused the rifts 
camp leaders are worried that nonaffilated readers and mediums 
operating at the hotel and on county land across the street will 
turn the town into a carnival and soil its repuation the outsiders 
say there should be no constraints on what is practiced in town 
its just growing pains said bonnie bemis who holds weekly 
services at the universal spiritualist center across the street 
its like a potbound plant straining to grow and flourish put 
us all in the same room and we believe the same thing 
there are just some people who are resistant to change 
astrologist hanan leeds who carries a 50yearold handpainted 
zodiac wheel in the rear of his car said theres no reason to 
fight theres enough energy here to go around

northbound endtoenders on the 
appalachian trail follow the green mountains about a third of the 
way up vermont before turning east for the last leg into new 
hampshire and maine 
but just south of that turn at sherburne pass theres a fight 
in the hills between hikers looking for wilderness serenity and 
the easts biggest ski area citing property rights as it looks to 
develop another mountain 
the fight is over a federal law designed to provide a 2140mile 
corridor of wilderness for the footpath from georgia to maine at 
issue is a deal struck by the national park service with killington 
ski area the sixmountain resort in southcentral vermont for a 
section of trail that crosses killington land 
the appalachian trail conference green mountain club and other 
environmental groups say the park service failed to take a tough 
enough antidevelopment stance in the talks that led to the 
agreement with killington 
if killington proceeds with the three ski trails one lift and 
associated buildings and other development allowed in the 
agreement hiking the trail will be more like walking through an 
amusement park than a pristine wilderness said james dumont a 
lawyer for the trail groups 
the agreement that has been executed in the opinion of the 
park service is in keeping with the trail legislation said chuck 
rinaldi project manager at the park services appalachian trail 
office in harpers ferry wva 
for the park service to have protected the trail to the extent 
sought by environmental groups rinaldi said would have required 
condemnation and the park service wasnt prepared to take that 
step 
all three members of vermonts congressional delegation have 
asked the park service and interior department to reconsider and 
trail advocates say theyre prepared to go to court to push for a 
tougher interpretation of the law 
sen patrick leahy dvt who wrote to interior secretary 
manuel lujan in early march asking for a review of the deal wrote 
again last week i remain concerned that the best professional 
judgment of park service trail managers was ignored during easement 
negotiations he said and warned that he was prepared to 
proceed legislatively if necessary 
the controversy is being watched closely up and down the trail 
because the park service is getting ready to negotiate agreements 
with at least three other ski areas the pico ski area adjacent to 
killington dartmouth college skiway in new hampshire and the 
saddleback ski resort in maine 
trail advocates say if the killington agreement is a model 
their goal of a 1000footwide corridor to provide a wilderness 
environment will be lost 
this sets just a horrible precedent said kevin peterson 
new england representative for the appalachian trail conference 
rinaldi acknowledged that the laws intent was to try to 
create a sense of remoteness for the hiker but said some 
people in the park service feel that its acceptable for ski 
trails to intersect the appalachian trail 
trail advocates say they believe the park service took a weaker 
negotiating stance with killington than other landowners the 
conservation law foundation has filed a freedom of information act 
request seeking documents describing how the deal was struck and 
how agreements with other landowners were reached 
killington vice president carl spangler said it was good legal 
research not a double standard that allowed the resort to keep 
more development rights than other landowners in fact he said 
the park service has overstepped its bounds with the other 
property owners 
killington hired a washington law firm that dug into the 
legislative history of the 1968 national trail systems act and 
found evidence that congress had not intended to block ski area 
development spangler said 
i think the park service was taken a little bit off guard i 
dont think they had seen this kind of presentation before 
among the material the lawyers found were excerpts from senate 
debate in which backers of the legislation assured sen george 
aiken rvt that the rights of ski areas would be in aikens 
words fully protected 
both sides also cite the trail act itself in saying that in 
selecting rightsofway full consideration shall be given to 
minimizing the adverse effects upon the adjacent landowner or user 
and his operation 
but they differ on whether that applies to development that is 
merely in the planning stages as well as that which is already in 
place 
killington and trail advocates agreed years ago to reroute the 
trail along the western ridge line of the green mountains to an 
area killington hasnt yet developed but spangler said the resort 
wants to maintain its right to develop the land and that when 
negotiations began with the government the resort had already 
mapped surveyed flagged and taken to a state environmental panel 
plans for a crosscountry ski trail crossing the trail corridor

cracking down too hard on tanker captain joseph 
hazelwood and others like him who drink and drive trains steer 
ships or fly planes could backfire and produce closet abusers say 
experts in the rehabilitation field 
alcohol and drug abusers can be cured but they will cover up 
their problem if they are forbidden to work at their old jobs 
professionals said 
when people know they will not be returned to their job if 
they do the right thing theyll do the wrong thing they wont get 
help said james wrich who ran the pilots rehabilitation 
program for united air lines for six years 
either you have recovering alcoholics or practicing 
alcoholics wrich said alcoholism exists in nuclear plants 
operating rooms and the airline and shipping industries you either 
help them recover or theyll cover it up 
the issue of pilots who hit the bottle before they hit the 
throttle resurfaced after the march 24 wreck of the exxon valdez in 
alaska the resulting oil spill was the worst in north america and 
the tanker captain was known by his employers to have a drinking 
problem 
since the wreck the exxon corp denounced around the world 
for an environmental disaster has taken a hard line on alcoholics 
exxon now says abusers of alcohol and drugs will be barred from 
piloting a ship flying a company plane or operating a refinery 
even after treatment they will be reassigned to less critical jobs 
even with close followup there are certain things you cant 
have people do exxon chairman lawrence rawl told a us house 
committee he told fortune magazine it was bad judgment to 
allow a captain with a drinking problem to command a tanker 
a very unfortunate thing happened said larry stockman who 
runs exxons employee health assistance program and defends the 
company line theyve got to seek some kind of measure so it 
never happens again 
but exxons new policy which also mandates random testing 
ignited a firestorm some felt it was exxons way of reacting to 
charges it mishandled the cleanup 
theyre trying to coverup their own guilt by blaming the 
victim said loren siegel of the american civil liberties union 
this is the jerk of a knee theyre sending a message to 
people with problems not to come foward said paul samuels of the 
legal action center a new yorkbased defender of individual 
rights from a legal point of view theyre wandering into 
unchartered waters 
but lt cmdr glenn anderson of the coast guard said of exxons 
decision can you blame them 
hazelwood captain of the exxon valdez lost his new york 
drivers license in 1984 when he refused to take a breathalyzer 
test and later pleaded guilty to drunken driving he was also 
convicted of drunken driving in new hampshire last september 
while he couldnt steer a car on land hazelwoods license to 
pilot supertankers at sea was never taken away it was renewed for 
five years in 1986 
hazelwood had turned over the helm to an unqualified third mate 
when the wandering ship rammed bligh reef and dirtied prince 
william sound with more than 10 million gallons of oil nine hours 
after the accident he was found legally drunk under coast guard 
standards on blood alcohol content that took effect last year 
new standards that require testing for drugs and alcohol after 
accidents at sea are being phased in this summer 
atlantic richfield co which also transports alaskan oil has 
ordered all crews to take breathalyzer tests before sailing the 
program begins in august for a 10tanker fleet 
under a 1985 law railroad employees are the only nongovernment 
people in the transportation industry who must undergo federally 
mandated testing for drugs and alcohol after an accident 
last month the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality 
of the tests 
eight to 10 percent of the us workforce has a problem with 
drug or alcohol abuse or both according to thomas delaney 
executive director of the association of labormanagement 
administrators and consultants on alcoholism 
one program viewed as a model for treatment covers the air line 
pilots association since 1973 more than 900 pilots have completed 
longterm rehabilitation and are flying again a success rate of 93 
percent alpa said 
an alcoholism program that doesnt returd 
pilot to the cockpit is only marginally more successful that the 
old approach of if we catn a rehabilitatech you well fire you said 
spokesman john mazor 
the exxon valdez accident is not isolated 
on jan 4 1987 a speeding conrail freight locomotive ran a 
stop signal and collided with an amtrak train near baltimore 
killing 16 passengers and injuring 170 people in the worst accident 
in amtrak history 
the conrail engineer richard l gates was an admitted 
alcoholic and tested positive for marijuana after the crash he was 
arrested for drunken driving a month before the train wreck and had 
been convicted eight times of speeding in his car 
on may 11 1988 engineer raymond hunter was killed when his 
commuter train rammed an empty train in new york city hunter 
tested positive for pot federal f the 
national transportation safety board 
the federal department of transportation has new regulations 
that will test airline pilots bus and truck drivers subway and 
commuter train engineers and pipeline transport workers the first 
tests wont come until december 
no one in private industry or the government is known to test 
job applicants for alcoholism it requires a blood sample which is 
more invasive than a urine test officials said 
in the private sector 43 percent of the nations largest firms 
including ibm atampt and 3m have drugscreening tests for job 
applicants or employees 
the proliferation of testing raises legal questions however 
we view preemployment screening and random testing as 
violations of employees privacy rights what it does is monitor 
peoples offduty activities said the aclus siegel 
but consumers say its not too much to expect sobriety 
you may be able to show me a guy whos a drunk driver and a 
great airline pilot tanker captain or railroad engineer but i 
dont want to ride with him said ross capon of the national 
association of rail passengers

broadway what fanshawe is up to going by boat and canoe to 
hundreds of islands in polynesia micronesia and melanesia will 
be revealed on the first two episodes of this seasons 
adventure on pbs 
fanshawe will be seen wearing shorts plus a cap blessed by a 
witchdoctor his face alight with childlike eagerness a tape 
recorder hanging over his shoulder a microphone in each hand 
recording traditional music 
tonights show is titled pacific journey adventures of a 
musical mariner papua new guinea a week later the location is 
tahiti and the easter islands 
an australian woman who learned what fanshawe was doing asked if 
her film crew could follow him around as he recorded music in 
remote places he said yes she got a bank loan and a crew 
followed him off and on for 18 months in 1985 and 86 
the soundtrack from the two adventure shows is released by 
mercury records as musical mariner pacific journey 
fanshawe says i think its the first time authentic music of 
these places is heard on a commercial record theres 18 minutes of 
my own music which serves to link the travels one piece is 
solomon island pan pipes the awakening an intermezzo for 
cello and piano 
fanshawe says ive carved a niche for myself which i believe 
to be unique there is no composer who does what i do 
in 1973 fanshawe a protestant composed african sanctus a 
latin mass in harmony with field recordings collected over four 
years traveling in east africa when its performed which it is 
often its by recording orchestra and chorus 
fanshawe will compose again this time using orchestra four 
soloists two choruses and his carefully cataloged pacific 
recordings he recorded hurricane oscar in fiji and thatll be 
included in pacific odyssey 
in his childhood in devon england fanshawe now 47 recalls 
i wanted to be an explorer i dreamed of going to africa he 
came from three generations of british army men stationed in india 
he also was composing putting himself to sleep nightly singing 
music hed invented at 17 a baroness whose sons were at the same 
school heard fanshawe playing fats waller jazz on a piano she 
stuck her head in a window and said youre very musical but you 
have no technique she offered piano lessons which he took for 
four years paying for them by modeling for the canterbury art 
school

six months a year and the other six months hitchhiked he says i 
rode camels with arabs in saudi arabia traveled through the 
euphrates iraq and iran people were very hospitable i lived on 
bread nothing nutritious i didnt steal i think i spent less 
than 20 pounds in six months 
he has been called a nut fanshawe says i have not fitted in 
would you consider with what ive achieved in my life that im a 
person whos a nut case but i am obsessed totally dedicated to 
what i do 
a turning point for fanshawe was hearing pearl divers sing in 
bahrain in 1967 it was more than beautiful it was guttural it 
was of the earth 
it was the work chants of these pearl divers that made me rush 
back to england and come back with a tape recorder a cassette 
fanshawe says that cultured pearls have put bahrains pearl divers 
out of business and their chants are no more 
after a 1975 bbc film reenacting his journey up the nile 
fanshawe lived in england for three years writing film and tv 
scores then he spun a globe and put his finger on fiji he went on 
a ninemonth reconnaissance then returned to england to bring his

anthony perkins is not an easy man to scare a 
challenging part doesnt faze the actor nor does a demanding 
director 
but the notorious norman bates does have one paralyzing fear 
blooper shows always terrify me said perkins 57 who stars 
as the tortured dr jekyllmr hyde in edge of sanity 
they confirm how thin the layer is when something funny 
happens everybody laughs right away it doesnt take anybody more 
than a tenth of a second to break up youd think in one of those 
shows someone somewhere would have to struggle to the surface 
for a moment before they start to laugh 
though perkins prides himself about his inner calm he enjoys 
the menace lurking in his screen characters when preparing for 
edge of sanity he viewed several of the previous jekyllhyde 
film portrayals including those of jack palance kirk douglas 
spencer tracy and the 1931 academy awardwinning performance of 
fredric march 
i like the ones where you could see that dr jekyll was not a 
problemfree easygoing dude perkins said its not fair to 
show him as being too straight arrow because after all he has 
this other side 
perkins cited spencer tracys 1941 characterization as his 
personal favorite you saw between the lines as he was playing 
jekyll you saw he had a darker less confident side you got a 
sneaky feeling that life was not all that great even though he was 
engaged to lana turner 
edge of sanity was filmed in hungary giving perkins 
originally a stage actor the opportunity to use an unusual method 
for rehearsing his part 
i got them to find me a theater that wasnt being used in 
downtown budapest he said i would rehearse by myself trying 
to fill the theater with a performance i spent a couple of days 
there doing the show as if it were a play 
then i did the same thing in a very small room even if it 
were a walkin closet i would perform it as if the doorknob were 
the lens 
perkins the son of stage and film actor osgood perkins was 
born in new york city even as a child he enjoyed getting the 
attention of others 
i was the one at a school assembly if a guest speaker was 
late who could just get up on stage with nothing but a folding 
chair and a blackboard and invent something that would keep going 
for as long as it needed to be i just did it without fear 
he broke into movies in 1953 appearing in the actress with 
tracy teresa wright and jean simmons he went on to make 
friendly persuasion in 1956 with gary cooper earning him an 
oscar nomination for supporting actor and costarred with gregory 
peck and fred astaire in the acclaimed 1959 antiwar film on the 
beach 
but it was the legendary pyscho alfred hitchcocks classic 
horror film in 1960 that made perkins and norman bates 
legends the movie proved so popular that the actor starred in two 
sequels and is currently preparing for pyscho iv 
norman appears on request perkins said i would even say 
on demand i can dial my own personal 800 number and norman will 
reply 
but he retains a strong affection for the stage starring most 
recently with mia farrow in romantic comedy perkins has been 
more critical of filmmaking complaining that the hurried pace 
prevents an actor from getting the most out of his character 
you have to sit down and be able to live and breath with a 
role for a long time really squeeze the last drop out of it you 
can do that with a play but in a film youre living with new 
material every day if you were just able to redo the scene the 
following day youd be twice as wise about it 
besides hitchcock perkins has been directed by george cukor 
the actress william wyler friendly persuasion orson 
welles the trial mike nichols catch22 and stanley 
kramer on the beach the actor declined to name a favorite 
anybody who can put in a day as a director on a feature film 
impresses me and im always the directors biggest fan biggest 
supporter he said 
its my business to see that that person is the sharpest 
swiftest funniest person most imaginative most gifted most 
sensitive most articulate most visionary person alive on the 
earth today

a reshuffling of new age radio programming 
over the past year with more vocals and more songs possessing 
something resembling a beat has opened up a musical niche for tom 
grant 
his mango tango lp has placed on both the billboard 
contemporary jazz and radio and records new adult contemporary 
charts and received extensive radio play because grant said he 
wisely refused to do a typical new age style album 
there has been a big change in radio he said in a recent 
interview a year ago there was a lot of straight new age real 
environmental music with lots of synthesizers lots of spacious 
music environments 
grant whose previous album night charade received airplay 
on new age format stations was under pressure to produce another 
lp heavily gauged to that audience 
i didnt i didnt want to get caught in that corner i came 
out with some stuff that had a beat the music has to move people 
rhythmically have some sock to it 
grants decision turned out to be good strategy mango tango 
came out just when the new age stations were changing their tune 
the album is tinged with latin rhythm more from grants upbeat 
attitude in writing the music than any exposure other than 
records to the southern hemisphere 
i owe a lot to the fact that a lot of those stations were 
willing to play that record said grant who noted that the same 
stations have also been playing vocal music over the past year or 
so 
grant 42 attributes his style which includes acoustic piano 
as well as electronic keyboards to growing up as the son of a jazz 
and rhythm and blues record store owner in oregon 
my brother also was a jazz fanatic and there were always 
bands and musicians around our house said grant whose mango 
tango is on gaia records 
for some reason there are a lot of bands that do real well 
playing original music here grant said of his native city 
portland there are a lot of clubs that will keep these bands 
working and theres a clientele for these clubs theres 
something in the air among his contemporaries from portland is 
musiciansongwriter patrick ohearn 
grant uses electronic keyboards but likes to keep his acoustic 
playing out front 
i basically consider myself a piano player he said i see 
myself coming from the tradition of people who play fusion jazz 
grants recording career actually spans more than 13 years 
mostly on small labels starting with mystified on timeless in 
1976 that was recorded while he was on tour in europe as a sideman 
for saxophonist joe henderson before that he played with sax 
player charles lloyd in a combo that included ohearn as a bass 
player 
he resumed his interest in performing music after a fouryear 
teaching stint he said he had gone into a tailspin following the 
death of his parents within a short time of each other 
his first albums did not set the charts on fire 
i released an album in 1980 called you hardly know me and 
it was a kind of hodgepodge of jazz rock n roll and weird 
vocals the record only got played on the leftwing stations on 
the left side of the dial the publicsponsored type stations he 
recalled 
what displeased grant was the unfocused sound of the lp 
definitely music from a man who hadnt made up his mind what he 
wanted to do 
i didnt realize until after that what i needed to focus on 
was the sound of the acoustic piano he said grant considers 
1983 the year he found his own groove signing with pausa records 
and forming the band that stayed with him on the gaia label his 
selftitled album in 1983 for pausa made the radio and records jazz 
chart 
the audience must have found us he said after that one 
record you hardly that i considered a bomb we started out 
playing a very simple kind of music still it built a following 
of record buyers and clubgoers 
grant also believes there is a hazard in the growing use of home 
studios to work out musical ideas rather than exposure to 
audiences and their reactions 
there are artists who can now afford to work out all their 
musical ideas at home alone with a vast amount of machinery that 
can make them sound huge i dont know if its a good thing or a 
bad thing but i do think it is the source of the new age music

john a tuccillo thinks economic statistics 
should be subject to quality control if they are to have any 
significance in our lives he believes a good many of them dont 
mean very much 
he fears they are just thrown around like confetti and that 
like confetti they are to be brushed off and forgotten about all 
they demonstrate he suggests is the offenders ability to use a 
pocket calculator 
quality control might also be applied to some of the 
profound insights offered these days but unlike the recent 
storm of statistics those insights have always been offered and 
probably always will be 
in on way or another that is calvin coolidges dazzling dictum 
when more and more people are thrown out of work unemployment 
results is likely to be restated just about every day get used 
to it 
with the numbers however it might be better to simply brush 
them off and forget them suggests tuccillo the chief economist of 
the national association of realtors to assist he offers a 
readers guide to economic data 
first numbers dont matter what they represent does matter 
inflation for instance is a problem only if the core rate of 
inflation for the economy is rising 
in february the producer price index rose sharply because of 
food and energy price jumps 
significant yes if the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries can continue to push up the price of oil and the drought 
of 1988 becomes the drought of 1989 if not then these are 
shortterm increases and inflation will not be a continuing 
problem 
next weekly numbers are not worth printing monthly numbers may 
be little better 
the only weekly number that shouuld have any validity in your 
lives is the number on your pay stub in the world of economics 
weekly numbers are the product of random static real changes take 
much longer to develop 
third some popular numbers simply do not matter 
the dow jones industrial average like the national political 
conventions and the academy award presentations is essentially a 
private party that has no business being thrust on the 
consciousness of the average american 
immediately after the stock market crash of october 1987 says 
tuccillo we learned how little that number either says about or 
influences economic life economic life went on of course and 
the market came back as well 
still several weeks passed before some people believed the 
world hadnt ended then the facts came out one of them being that 
most people dont own stocks and so werent hurt proving that the 
stock market is not the economy 
finally figures dont lie liars figure americans are sprayed 
with numbers which seem to add up but which really dont the use 
of decimaled numbers for instance can suggest that the message 
itself is also precise 
but says tuccillo statistics are meaningful only in context 
and without the context they take on the flavor of three out of 
four doctors recommend asparagus souffle for a fever 
the doctors he warns could be the fictional drs seuss and 
doolittle and dr j the professional basketball player that 
demonstrates he says that you should look not only at the 
messages content but its source too

the national debate over abortion in recent 
years has focused increasingly on the legal status of the fetus 
not a person under the constitution but protected by various 
state laws and court decisions 
the righttolife movement has been largely successful in 
shifting the focus to the fetus and away from the woman and her 
family due in part to the prochoice movements apathy said 
dawn johnsen legal director of the prochoice national abortion 
rights action league 
that apathy ended she said when the supreme court agreed to 
review a missouri abortion dispute in which arguments will be 
conducted wednesday 
at stake could be the continued vitality of the courts landmark 
1973 decision legalizing abortion 
the legal status of a fetus is not a key point in the missouri 
case just as socalled fetal rights were not a consideration in 
the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
the court ruled then that a fetus referred to as the 
potentiality for human life is not a person under the 
constitutions 14th amendment 
the amendment ratified in 1868 says no state may deprive any 
person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor 
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of 
the law 
roe vs wade said women have a constitutional right to abortion 
based on their right to privacy 
the court said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
it said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the 
second trimester only to protect the womans health and may take 
steps to protect fetal life only in the third trimester when the 
fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute 
outside the abortion context fetal rights had been expanding 
long before 1973 the trend has continued since although affected 
by roe vs wade 
under laws in virtually all states a child has the right to 
inherit even though he or she was not yet born when the will maker 
died 
since 1946 most states have imposed legal liability either 
criminal or civil on those who willfully or negligently cause the 
death or injury of a fetus 
for example the fetus is a person for purposes of 
massachusetts vehicular homicide law it is protected by murder 
statutes in some states such as illinois iowa michigan 
mississippi new hampshire oklahoma utah washington and 
wisconsin 
two years ago the iowa supreme court ruled that a fetus is a 
person for insurance purposes 
the state court said the parents of a 6monthold fetus who died 
as the result of an automobile crash caused by an uninsured 
motorist were entitled to collect from their insurance company for 
loss of consortium 
narals johnsen said in a recent interview that treating a fetus 
differently in differing legal contexts is not inconsistent and 
said she has no quarrel with laws that protect the woman and her 
wanted fetus 
in a 1986 law journal article johnsen wrote holding third 
parties responsible for negligent or criminal destruction of 
fetuses is consistent with and even enhances the protection of 
pregnant womens interests 
but the article criticized courts for failing to recognize the 
fundamental differences between a woman deciding to terminate her 
own pregnancy and a third party intruding upon her body to end that 
pregnancy against her will 
james bopp general counsel of the national right to life 
committee bristles when discussing the potentiality of human 
life phrase used in roe vs wade 
is it human life of course he said in an interview no 
woman has ever given birth to anything but a member of the species 
so it is human and its a biological fact that its alive 
he said the central question is whether the fetus has valued 
human qualities that society wants to protect the question is 
whether taking the life of the unborn is consequential 
johnsen disagrees defining the fetus as human life does not 
answer any questions about the legal status of a fetus she said 
the central question is the legal implications of treating a 
fetus as a person under the law 
she called extending 14th amendment protection to a fetus a 
dangerous step because it would necessitate balancing the fetal 
right to life against a womans right to privacy 
once you say politicians can speak in behalf of the fetus 
theres no stopping point johnsen said

all you need for the annual louisiana jazz 
and heritage festival is a good set of ears some comfortable 
clothes and lots of napkins to wipe the grease from your lips 
the festival launches its 20th anniversary this month with a 
twoweek 3 million celebration featuring 3000 musicians and tons 
of good food 
i honestly think the new orleans festival is not only the 
largest but the most important in the world said george wein 
the producer who founded the new orleans event and helped launch 
others including the famed newport jazz festival 
lots of big name artists come to the jazz fest and hide 
themselves in the crowd so they can enjoy it 
the formula for success has been finetuned since that first 
1969 festival in congo square off rampart street and this years 
event scheduled april 28 through may 7 will look a lot like the 
one last year 
its been so successful that we didnt see any reason to 
change it said anna zimmerman spokeswoman for the festival 
were always looking for ways to make things work better but 
we looked into the archives about when it started and its 
basically the same its just bigger were expecting 300000 
and well be happy with that 
the festival is really two events a series of evening jazz 
concerts and a pair of weekend heritage fairs with openair stages 
surrounded by food and crafts 
this years concerts feature wynton marsalis miles davis 
george benson jimmy buffett al green and santana 
some of their performances will be in a new riverside tent on 
the banks of the mississippi river the most conspicuous change in 
the way the festival is staged this year 
in the past nightly riverboat concerts aboard the president 
were an integral part of the program but the owners moved the old 
paddlewheeler to a new station at st louis leaving festival 
organizers to find a new forum 
they resorted to a big tent which will have more seats better

irma thomas never misses jazz fest if the 
famed blues artist isnt on stage shes out front listening or at 
a food booth eating 
oh yes indeed she said i try to be everywhere at 
once thats the only bad part there are always two or three 
things going on at once and you cant hit them all 
theres so much good music i try to listen to it all and the 
food is just as bad i try to have some of it all too everyone 
overeats at the jazz fest 
the twoweek celebration formally known as the new orleans jazz 
and heritage festival begins april 28 in the lineup are 3000 
musicians with the weekend fairs featuring continuous music on 11 
stages thomas will perform april 30 continuing an uninterrupted 
string of appearances that began in 1974 
you get a real international audience at the jazz fest she 
said people from all over the world are in the crowd and they 
are all very knowledgeable 
they will let me do some new things and some popular numbers 
but they always want to hear my oldies its raining wish 
someone would care the songs they remember 
although she performs her soulful rendition of the blues all 
over the world thomas is still considered a new orleans artist 
its ok i have no problem with being a new orleans artist 
even though most of the major labels seem to shy away from you once 
youre known as one i think its because were all kind of 
stubborn when it comes to change we know how we want our music to 
sound and we wont agree to strings instead of brass or 
synthesizers or different things producers in other places think 
sound right she said 
thomas most recent recording the way i feel on the 
rounder label maintains the new orleans feeling 
at 48 thomas who has been performing for 31 years has 
developed a large and loyal following 
rita coolidge and i have really become good friends and mutual 
fans she said we try to do a set or two together at the jazz 
fest and you can always see other singers and musicians out in the 
audience a lot of those who perform there also stick around to 
listen to the others 
jazz fest is as much a food fair as a music festival and thomas 
is known among family and friends for virtuoso performances in the 
kitchen as well 
people are always telling me i should write a cook book she 
said with a laugh i like cooking and i know good food thats 
for sure 
her four children are grown and have left home as have the 
three of her husbandmanager emile jackson but she still spends 
plenty of time at the stove 
im always making something or emile wants a treat or i just 
want to taste some real food she said if i ever stop singing 
i could make my living cooking

when horror maven stephen king taught 
creative writing at the university of maine he moved his family 
into a house near a cemetery for pets 
the setting inspired the bestselling authors pet sematary 
which he adapted to the screen for the new paramount pictures 
horror movie 
the house was on route 15 a speedway for truckers dogs cats 
and other animals didnt stand a chance 
everything in the book and in the movie is true up to a 
certain point where it crosses the line into fantasy king said 
in an interview 
directed by mary lambert siesta the movie stars dale 
midkiff as louis creed fred gwynne as his neighbor jud and 
denise crosby as his wife rachel it features a cameo appearance 
by king who portrays a minister presiding at the funeral of the 
creeds 2yearold son who wanders out to the highway chasing a 
kitten and is hit by a truck 
pet sematary whose theme of returning from the dead is 
derivative of the popular tale the monkeys paw is a thriller 
that unravels the evil legacy of an ancient indian burial ground 
while living in orrington where giant fertilizer trucks 
frequently sped along the highway in front of his house king 
witnessed the deathof his daughters cat smucky in pet 
sematary little ellie creeds cat church meets the same fate 
the king feline was immortalized in the novel and the movie with 
a grave marker that read smucky he was obedient 
even more anguishing to king was the time he tackled his 
2yearold son just as he was about to dash onto the road an 
episode that inspired the tragic denouement of pet sematary 
the film and the novel reflect the terror that strikes at the 
hearts of parents when they recognize how precious and fragile the 
lives of their young children can be king said 
were not talking about freddie or jason here he said 
referring to the popular villains of the nightmare on elm 
street and friday the 13th series were talking about a 
kid who gets killed in a senseless road accident 
following publication of the 1983 novel which remained on the 
new york times bestseller list for more than 30 weeks souvenir 
hunters visited the orrington cemetery and removed most of the 
grave markers 
millions of readers have paid vicarious visits to rural maine 
through kings spinechilling novels but pet sematary is the 
first movie adaptation to be filmed in the authors home state 
aside from scenes of a roadside neon lobster sign bangor 
international airport or the clock tower in downtown ellsworth the 
maine setting provides a feel for a state that has seldom been 
showcased by hollywood producers the author said 
it adds a lot he said predicting that audiences will 
appreciate the authenticity of the locale theyre going to know 
that its maine and just as important theyre going to know that 
its not california 
king whose other books have been filmed in such locations as 
california north carolina oregon and the canadian province of 
ontario insisted that pet sematary be made in maine 
it was seen as a shot in the arm for the nascent maine film 
commission which has been trying to lure production companies to 
maine and help the state recover from its disappointing loss of 
on golden pond to neighboring new hampshire 
while the fictitious setting of pet sematary is called 
ludlow a town located in aroostook county king acknowledged 
that the cemetery site is actually in orrington a suburb 10 miles 
outside bangor he lived there when he returned to the state 
university his alma mater as a writerinresidence 
king who has been openly critical of the movie versions of 
several of his books has nothing but praise for the latest film 
which is also the only one for which he wrote the screenplay rob 
reiners highly acclaimed stand by me remains his favorite 
movie adaptation of his writings 
a maine native the author acknowledges that his familiarity 
with his home state makes it an ideal setting for his fiction but 
he feels the nature of the place also provides a gothic flavor 
were a little bit cut off a little bit insular here and 
its truer as you get further north he said i like to get 
away from the centers of population to places where things could 
happen and no one would really know

ive got a hot one for you whispers the 
stock tout furtively into the telephone 
its a hightech outfit with increasing earnings growth and 
the big money managers havent picked up on it yet names american 
telephone amp telegraph 
an unlikely script perhaps but after spending decades as the 
epitome of the staid blue chip atampt stock has lately been 
threatening to transform itself into something more zippy 
when it climbed to 3462 last week in response to a 
firstquarter earnings report that lived up to wall streets hopes 
atampt sported a gain of 204 percent since the beginning of 1989 
roughly doubling the performance of the market as a whole 
the rally put the stock just a little more than a point shy of 
the peak of 3587 it reached before the crash of 1987 while many 
other bigname issues still languish far from their former highs 
the shares of american telephone amp telegraph have been one of 
the markets better performers so far this year and we believe 
they will continue to do well on an intermediate and longterm 
basis asserts the current edition of the merrill lynch market 
letter 
such sanguine appraisals have seldom been heard on wall street 
in recent years especially since the company was established in 
its current form with the breakup of the bell system on jan 1 
1984 
the baby bells the seven regional operating companies that 
were split off from atampt in the divestiture almost immediately 
galloped out ahead of their progenitor 
within three years all of them more than doubled in price the 
new atampt which had begun trading at 19 meanwhile struggled along 
in the mid 20s 
the baby bells showered their owners with dividend increases and 
stock splits atampts dividend remained stuck at 120 a share it 
even reported a loss for 1988 as a result of a 39 billion 
special charge it took to write off outdated equipment 
a oncepopular and widely understood company with more than 3 
million shareholders had become a murky entity involved in a 
mixture of new and old ventures whose prospects were difficult to 
discern 
there have been many and often confusing changes in the 
company since the breakup merrill lynch analysts acknowledge in 
a written appraisal 
but we believe atampt now is heading into a period of steady and 
sustainable earnings growth that will make its stock more 
attractive to investors 
among other things the company seems likely to win more 
attention from large institutional investors who now own only 24 
percent of its stock a relatively low level for one of the 
largest and most widely held stocks 
at its annual meeting last wednesday the company reported a 
207 percent earnings increase for the first quarter chairman 
robert allen said that pace was not an aberration and might 
well be sustained in quarters to come 
the company attributed its improved results to better profits 
from longdistance operations and from international sales of its 
products and services merrill lynch expects it also to show 
smaller losses from its computer business as the year progresses 
in a deregulated world atampt continues to face more competition 
and risks than it ever knew before the breakup as big as it 
remains it cannot reasonably hope to produce the kind of dramatic 
earnings gains that true growthstock fanciers like to see 
still as its stock price shows the company seems lately to 
have won back some old friends on wall street and even made some 
new ones

sixyearolds bundled in coats sit 
shoulder to shoulder on benches in the classroom each working 
desperately to solve an algebra problem and beat the others 
eager hands shoot into the air as the 54 children vie to get the 
answer first and be noticed in a country where education in a 
tough regimented school system is a national obsession 
koreans are the hardest workers in the world said lee 
jeanjae director of the national institute of education 
evaluation they study without letup 
the system produces pupils who achieve some of the highest 
scores in international testing but 
can it teach the thinking and reasoning processes needed to 
apply the information and deal with life does their education 
prepare youngsters to be good citizens does it produce innovative 
creative thinkers needed for the future 
some critics say no 
korean education like the system in neighboring japan is based 
on rote memorization that enables a student who works hard to 
produce enormous amounts of facts and data that result in 
impressive scores on tests designed for such a regimen 
in south korea education is equated with success the argument 
goes the more education the more success the more people 
educated the greater success for the nation 
detractors say the system clones human computers who can pour 
out endless streams of information but cannot think creatively and 
that it contributes to the insecurity and tension that beset south 
korean society 
the american manager of a company in seoul said he hired a dozen 
koreans with masters degrees in business administration who 
recited verbatim the case studies in any textbook they had read but 
had difficulty being creative about daily tasks 
robert a brown a linguistics professor at ewha womens 
university in seoul says the rote approach suits the societys 
traditional confucian respect for the scholar 
as he explained it the teacher knows something talks to the 
students who absorb it they dont doubt they memorize and that 
ties into the exam 
they teach what they test for you cant change the test 
without changing the curriculum 
under that system brown said a student fails to memorize at 
his own risk 
a south korean professor said privately his country is 
educating barbarians he said students become disillusioned and 
feel deceived when they go to college start asking questions and 
face conflicting opinions for the first time 
many become alienated and join the ranks of radical students 
who although a small minority have become extremely vocal and 
demonstrate often violently to demand the overthrow of the 
government and the expulsion of us troops from south korea 
increasingly militant labor unions include thousands of high 
school graduates who could not get into a university and feel the 
system cheated them 
a high score on the college entrance exam often is a ticket to 
the elite class through a good college prestigious job and higher 
standard of living it is family insurance in a nation that was 
ravaged by war only 36 years ago 
like marching ranks of welltrained soldiers young koreans 
slave over books and endure physical and psychological hardship to 
pursue prestige and success in the scholastic sweepstakes 
a recent assessment of mathematics and science by the 
educational testing service compared 24000 13yearolds in 
ireland spain britain the united states south korea and canada 
south korean 13yearolds were highest in mathematics and tied 
for the honors in science with youngsters from british columbia 
canada 
several korean educators who saw the test involved said it would 
be easy for a korean 13yearold an education ministry said he 
would come down hard on 9 and 10yearold koreans if they could 
not answer the questions 
lee the national institute of education evaluation director 
said he was not surprised by the high korean scores or by those in 
the united states which ran last he said said us math and 
science texts are too easy 
children in south korea devote countless hours to memorizing 
facts and copying from textbooks 
some as young as 10 stay up all night doing homework by the 
last years of high school they study more than 12 hours a day in a 
stressful contest said by its critics to waste minds rather than 
building them

the regulars who drifted into the buffalo 
grill for a hamburger or the luncheon special chickenfried steak 
hadnt heard of republican strategist ed rollins nor did they care 
about any national trends washington pundits see in the race to 
fill dick cheneys house seat 
to them its just a choice between two wyoming politicians 
as good as any gallup poll ownercook gary matz stood in the 
doorway of the grills kitchen and nodded toward a couple eating 
the luncheon special 
strong republican he said 
chalk up two votes for craig thomas another patron he said is 
a vote for democrat john vinich 
in this town of 282 people two grain elevators a hotel the 
grill a couple of stores a garage and the chugwater chili co 
matz has a pretty good sense of his patrons politics strong 
republican covers most people 
without the benefit of a matz in every community scattered 
across the nations most sparsely populated state the two 
campaigns are doing their own daily polling as the campaign headed 
toward the balloting wednesday a slight trend toward thomas was 
turning up 
were showing everything just about dead even right now 
said howard schloss spokesman for the democratic congressional 
campaign committee 
when asked if there was any movement schloss conceded a 
little bit away from us 
john buckley spokesman for the national republican 
congressional committee said their polling shows the numbers are 
widening up a little bit in favor of thomas 
yet national gop officials remained markedly nervous about the 
special election to fill the only house seat in this state where 
republicans outnumber democrats by 3 to 2 
a gop loss would be the third in a month and the second in which 
the democrats capture a house seat held by a republican first the 
democrats took dan quayles old house seat in indiana and then 
easily beat back a gop effort to turn the tables in alabama the 
special election losses have been a political cold shower for a 
party still celebrating its fifth victory in the last six 
presidential elections 
and when president bush created another vacancy by naming cheney 
secretary of defense the democrats had a campaignhardened 
candidate ready to compete for the seat in this western state 
vinich a 38yearold state senator came within 1300 votes of 
upsetting republican sen malcolm wallop last november an effort 
that gave the democrat a big edge in name recognition over thomas 
nearly beat malcolm wallop comes out like one word every 
time they mention him vinich lamented thomas 55 heres a 
guy whos been running for a year and a half 
enter rollins the milliondollar consultant hired by house 
republicans frustrated by the fact they hold 17 fewer seats now 
than they did when ronald reagan was inaugurated president in 1981 
given a fouryear contract and a mandate to reverse gop fortunes 
rollins saw his first two races end in defeat 
wyoming is something ive had hands on since day one he 
said 
that handed vinich a perfect issue in a state where meddling by 
outsiders particularly from washington is resented 
the outside washington consultants have taken charge of the 
thomas campaign taunted a vinich television commercial 
then the national gop committee commissioned a poll asking 
voters if theyd change their opinion of vinich if they knew there 
was a third person a democratic consultant from washington in 
the car when the candidate was involved in a traffic accident 
state police said only two people were in the car democrats 
with some relish denounced the question as gutter politics 
with his washington friends thomas was looking like he had no 
need of enemies 
it was an unnecessary nuisance he said and im mad about 
it and fed up with it the gop candidate said hed held a 
seminar with rollins to make it clear who was in charge of the 
campaign 
in washington the political knives were out for rollins 
were on the defensive when we should be on a roll said a 
prominent republican operative who insisted on anonymity 
rollins has whipped this thing way way out in front on national 
interference local folks dont appreciate that and the 
democrats have used it well 
thomas struck back against vinich with his own charges of 
outside influence focusing on contributions to the democrat from 
the international ladies garment workers union and the seafarers 
union 
dukakis and vinich are cut out of the same cloth said 
thomas linking his opponent to democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis who took only 39 percent of wyomings vote 
i dont think the liberal thing is catching hold said 
vinich while conceding that in certain areas the labor thing 
might be catching hold more 
among the ranchers and small businessmen in wyoming union is a 
dirty word the state has a righttowork law and thomas contended 
vinich would like to repeal it 
for a while it sounded like the issues in wyoming were a choice 
between ed rollins and the aflcio all this in a state where 
because of the slump in energy and agriculture the population 
declined by 30000 in the past four years 
from that point on the race didnt get any kinder or gentler 
vinich came up with his version of the willie horton ad that so 
effectively suggested dukakis was soft on crime the democrat 
questioning thomas conservative credentials ran an ad saying 
thomas had voted in the wyoming house for a bill to grant early 
release from jail for convicted felons thomas thought there wasnt 
enough room so his solution was to let them out on the streets 
the ad referred to the states splitsentencing law that 
authorized sending those convicted of nonviolent crimes to county 
jails to ease overcrowding in state prisons 
thomas wasnt alone in voting for the bill all but two members 
of the wyoming house backed it and only vinich in the state senate 
opposed it 
despite criticism from many democrats vinich refused to 
withdraw the ad 
wyoming gov mike sullivan is a democrat who won an upset 
victory over pete simpson in the 1986 gubernatorial race the 
brother of popular sen alan simpson sullivans opponent was 
heavily favored 
i campaigned hard and i took a pretty conservative position 
sullivan said of his race there may even have been a perception 
that pete was more liberal than i was 
sullivan says he doesnt like negative ads even as he conceded 
they can work 
back at the buffalo grill gary matz said hes an independent 
and a conservative but he intends to vote for vinich because 
thomas says agriculture isnt important a line that comes 
straight from a vinich ad that thomas has denounced as false

when actor michael j fox was invited seven 
years ago to read the part of alex p keaton for the new show 
family ties he was a walking poster child for hollywood 
heartbreak 
i was at a point fox said recently holding up a 
thimblesized container of coffee creamer where id say can 
you eat this three ketchups a thing of cream and a package of 
salt and pepper and i was pigging out 
but fox hasnt had to worry about his pantry since he picked up 
that first family ties script and was handed the job too the 
situation comedy which is leaving the nbc schedule with a onehour 
special may 14 has lasted longer than leave it to beaver 
the flintstones or hogans heroes 
the departure of family ties planned for two years wont 
match the majestic 1983 parting of cbs mash but the 
programs exit after seven seasons does illustrate how one modest 
series both created careers and helped revitalize a stagnant 
television genre the nuclearfamily sitcom 
we could do more stick around and do three more years said 
gary david goldberg the shows creator and executive producer 
but why weve done 180 episodes of this show and this family 
surely there must be other things we want to turn our attention 
to 
the actors of family ties shared a chaotic mixture of 
sadness gratitude and exuberance as their programs last episode 
approached as the character of alex set off for a job on wall 
street where there arent any more television cameras 
i have very ambiguous feelings about it meredith baxter 
birney who plays family ties parent elyse keaton said of the 
shows conclusion i think im going to be dreadfully emotional 
the last couple of days but until then im so excited i cant 
see straight 
all of the cast now will have time to pursue other projects but 
without family ties a halfhour centering on consumerminded 
children in a home headed by former hippies there might not be any 
such projects to pursue 
there is no way to overemphasize how important family 
ties was for me fox said with all the things i have going 
on right now everybody says boy i bet you cant wait to get 
that chain off your neck but i never think of it in those terms 
the success through association that ive enjoyed thats 
really been the blessing 
justine bateman who costars in family ties as dippy 
dressforexcess older daughter mallory says she doesnt have to 
follow her prominence on family ties with other prominent roles 
i am definitely looking forward to playing other characters 
she said but because of family ties i have the unique 
privilege of not having to worry about paying the mortgage so now 
i can just work with good people and not have the pressure of 
carrying a film 
other family ties veterans are using the shows ending to 
follow related interests fifteenyearold tina yothers who plays 
younger sister jennifer will now have more time for her singing 
career more time to polish her rendition of baby im back in 
love again 
yet just as the shows once dominant popularity has brought the 
cast fame and riches family ties was the nations no 2 
program in the 198586 and 198687 tv seasons just a step behind 
nbcs the cosby show the exposure also means the actors must 
prove theres more to them than good timing and silly jokes 
will audiences for years see michael gross only as the keaton 
familys goofy dad steven can anybody take bateman seriously after 
so much of mallorys ditziness it is not an idle question 
after leaving mash for example alan alda starred in a 
variety of film and television roles but the actor is still looked 
upon by many only as army surgeon capt hawkeye pierce similarly 
patrick duffy left cbs dallas to chase other roles but his 
dallas reputation was so ingrained he was forced to come back 
to the serial 
obviously to a certain extent this thing is a doubleedged 
sword said gross i sometimes wonder if some actors dont 
spend the entire first part of their careers looking for a 
television series and the entire second half of their careers 
trying to elude the persona that theyve created in that television 
series 
i am going at the problem by seeking other things i routinely 
turn down offers that deal with fathers and teenagers gross 
said people see family ties and they say oh good 
thats what he does and i put the word out no he doesnt 
said fox who will costar with sean penn in the coming vietnam 
film casualties of war i keep doing these serious films and 
if they do well they do well if they dont im also comfortable 
being a shtick man i dont mind getting two minutes for high 
shticking

frank susmans commitment to abortion rights 
began 20 years ago when as a legal volunteer for a suicide 
hotline he realized how many women with unwanted pregnancies were 
considering killing themselves 
this week that commitment takes him before the us supreme 
court to argue the most important abortion case since the procedure 
was legalized in 1973 
on wednesday susman will present oral arguments against a 
missouri law that he and other prochoice advocates believe poses a 
serious threat to abortion rights the antiabortion side will be 
argued by missouri attorney general william webster in support of 
the law and harvard professor charles fried representing the bush 
administration which seeks to overturn the landmark roe vs wade 
decision of 1973 
clearly this is the greatest threat to womens liberty in 
those 16 years said the 47yearold susman who acknowledges 
feeling great pressure you spend most of your time thinking 
cogitating meditating just thinking about it and reshuffling the 
cards 
it was in the late 1960s and early 70s that susman working as 
a volunteer lawyer for suicide prevention inc realized the 
anguish of women with unwanted pregnancies 
it was difficult then as it is now to imagine anything as 
horrendous as being pregnant and not wanting to be he said in an 
interview friday 
that work led him to help another group that assisted women 
seeking legal abortions out of state or illegal abortions locally 
i had never known a person who had had an abortion until 
then he said 
susman has argued abortion cases before the supreme court 
before but never one as potentially damaging to abortion rights as 
webster vs reproductive health services 
the missouri law passed in 1986 restricts abortion by banning 
the procedure in publicly funded hospitals and forbidding the use 
of public funds and declares that human life begins at conception 
the law was blocked from going into effect by a classaction 
suit led by reproductive health services of st louis planned 
parenthood of greater kansas city and others 
the us district court in kansas city declared major sections 
of the law unconstitutional the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld the decision the supreme court agreed earlier this year to 
hear the case 
susman who represents about 20 abortion clinics nationwide on a 
parttime basis once stopped at a clinic to help escort clients 
past pickets 
i just happened to be driving by and saw this mob scene 
susman said later one of the picketers sued him for 250000 
claiming hed assaulted her as he walked a woman to the clinic a 
jury cleared him 
susmans commitment to his belief that women should be allowed 
to make their own decisions on abortion has made him a target for 
harassment by mail and telephone someone once placed a bogus ad in 
a st louis paper that said his house was for sale more recently 
the phone lines to his home were cut 
the threats dont bother me at all for myself he said 
they bother me for members of my family that concerns me 
susman said he respected his opponents depth of commitment to 
their belief but i strongly criticize their total intolerance 
and inability to perceive how anyone could disagree with them he 
said 
no one really knows what they think about abortion until they 
are faced with a pregnancy that they dont want he said ive 
never seen an abortion for convenience its a gutwrenching 
agonizing decision

the missouri abortion case being 
argued before the us supreme court this week will be the first 
state attorney general william webster has personally argued before 
the justices since being elected in 1984 
although some observers say webster has tried not to politicize 
the case critics wonder if the 35yearold republican is using it 
to boost his political future webster is already laying the 
groundwork for a 1992 bid for governor 
tony feather executive director of the missouri republican 
party expressed doubt that politics was behind websters decision 
to personally argue before the court but acknowledged the case has 
not hurt him 
hes already got a strong political benefit out of it by the 
fact that its gone this far i dont think he would argue it if he 
didnt think he was the best attorney for it feather said 
six missouri cases have been heard by the us supreme court 
during websters tenure 
in next weeks arguments webster will defend a 1986 missouri 
law prohibiting the use of public funds for abortions and declaring 
that human life begins at conception sections of the law were 
found unconstitional by the us district court in kansas city and 
that decision was upheld by the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
given the publicity the case is getting its hard not to say 
that webster is arguing it to promote himself thomas blumenthal 
a lawyer for abortion rights advocates said recently this makes 
it more obvious this is a political question not a legal one 
webster contends he is merely trying to do the best job possible 
on the case named webster vs reproductive health services 
this is one of the most important cases of the term it is one 
of national significance and it merits my personal participation 
webster said through a spokeswoman mary jenkins 
feather said webster has sequestered himself in his office in 
recent weeks to study the case and has shut off interviews 
webster a former radio reporter is usually accessible to 
reporters 
weve bent over backwards not to politicize this case ms 
jenkins said 
a native of carthage in southwestern missouri webster earned a 
speech and communications degree from the university of kansas 
before getting his law degree from the university of 
missourikansas city he practiced law in joplin before being 
elected attorney general 
when he was first elected attorney general in 1984 he was 31 
the youngest person to hold that office in missouri in nearly 100 
years 
webster is personally prolife but he feels that his personal 
views are irrelevant it is his constitutional duty to uphold the 
law ms jenkins said

charles fried who will represent the bush 
administration when the supreme court hears arguments wednesday in 
a missouri abortion case says he considers himself more a legal 
scholar than a litigator 
the harvard university law school professor author of six books 
on the law has the proper academic credentials but he also served 
as solicitor general the governments topranked courtroom lawyer 
for four years 
during that tenure he was criticized by those who said he was 
too willing to mix litigation with ideological politics 
in the justice departments no 3 job fried was viewed as a 
champion of the reagan administrations conservative social agenda 
in appearances before the supreme court he vigorously opposed 
broad use of affirmative action and expansive interpretations of 
civil rights law 
and he once urged the court to overturn its landmark roe vs 
wade decision which legalized abortion in 1973 
in a 1985 friendofthecourt brief supporting pennsylvania 
abortion regulations that were later invalidated by a 44 high 
court vote fried said roe vs wade is so far flawed that this 
court should overrule it 
there is no explicit textual warrant in the constitution for a 
right to an abortion fried wrote in that brief 
the chances of the court reversing its seminal abortion ruling 
at that time were viewed as very slim 
but fried dismissed the criticism generated by his briefs 
approach i think theres something condescending about only 
saying things which on some kind of nosecounting prognostication 
the court is going to adopt he said 
he accused the news media of doing a poor job in reporting the 
1985 brief 
the press which does not like to read things but prefers to 
call people up on the telephone and provoke them into 
indiscretions called me a lot when that brief was filed fried 
told a us chamber of commerce audience 
they said what was the reason for you taking the position 
you did and that gave me a chance to say you dont understand 
a brief is not like a symphony its not like a directive its not 
even like a proclamation a brief is nothing but reasons 
although he left his government post to return to harvard last 
january fried was asked to return to represent the solicitor 
generals office in wednesdays argument 
fried 53 is the son of a jewishczech industrialist when he 
was 4 his family fled the nazis and moved to england then to the 
united states 
a brilliant student fried excelled at princeton oxford and 
columbias law school he served as a law clerk to the late supreme 
court justice john harlan during the courts 196061 term before 
becoming one of the youngest individuals ever appointed as a member 
of the harvard faculty

george bush is nearing the 100day milestone 
of his presidency boasting of scattered achievements and riding 
high in the polls but offering few clues about the mystery that 
has long surrounded him 
the questions where is he going what does he stand for what 
does he want to do 
he wants to be known as the education president but draws 
criticism for his proposed 441 million program inexpensive by 
washington standards to reward excellence among students and 
schools 
he calls himself an environmentalist but comes under attack for 
not moving more quickly to limit the spread of the americas worst 
oil spill 
he takes a stand against tougher gun controls but then turns 
around and authorizes a temporary ban on imports of semiautomatic 
assault weapons 
i think his grade is incomplete said presidential scholar 
james david barber of duke university we still have yet to see 
what he is going to do if anything 
there is a puzzlement about what george bush stands for 
agreed thomas cronin a political scientist at colorado college 
ronald reagan was able to be a mr rogers and a john wayne 
back and forth he was neighborly and friendly but he occasionally 
took a hard ideological stand cronin said bush is neither 
hes not defined the american people are not sure who he is 
countering claims that hes off to a slow start bush cites his 
budget and deficitreduction agreement with congress and a 
bipartisan plan for humanitarian aid for contra rebels in nicaragua 
moreover he points to his proposal for rescuing the ailing 
savings and loan industry his plan to tighten ethical standards in 
government his diplomacy with leaders from the middle east and a 
new formula to ease third world debt 
i think were moving reasonably well bush said thursday 
and i dont even think in terms of 100 days because we arent 
radically shifting things we didnt come in here throwing the 
rascals out to try to do something correct all the ills of the 
world in 100 days 
white house chief of staff john sununu bristles at suggestions 
that bush is moving too cautiously taking too much time for 
instance reviewing foreign policy strategy before renewing arms 
talks with the soviet union 
when george bush had to make quick decisions you got them 
sununu said 
you got the savings and loan plan in two weeks you got a 
budget plan laid out on feb 9 
everytime theres an opportunity there hes gone out and 
jumped on it sununu said and where opportunities do exist for 
considered evaluation you get that too 
many people think its unrealistic to judge a president by his 
first 100 days a standard first applied to franklin d roosevelts 
administration as he tried to pull america out of the depression 
for bush the 100th day falls next saturday 
rather than look at 100 days look at the first crisis test 
that will tell you more about this white house said tom griscom 
former white house communications chief under reagan 
norman ornstein a political analyst at the american enteprise 
institute said a president should be judged by his first six 
months not first three 
in the first phase of a presidency we see set in place a 
stereotype an image as it were of what kind of president we 
have ornstein said it takes a while for that to set in first 
it sets in among the opinion leaders then it spreads out beyond 
the beltway 
as much as americans loved reagan and his biggerthanlife 
image they seem charmed by bushs openness and downtoearth style 
he plays with puppies pitches horseshoes and coddles his 
grandchildren he likes to fish and drive a fast boat every 
sunday he takes his wife to church 
in sharp contrast to reagan bush seems to love to hold news 
conferences 
he is not a managed president said griscom he is not 
scripted out everything is not timed out to the half second 
polls show bush enjoys widespread public support with job 
approval ratings as high as 71 percent thats higher than reagan 
at this time in his adminstration says republican pollster linda 
divall 
ed lazarus partner in a democratic polling and strategy 
company discounts bushs good ratings 
there is novelty to him and we always like all things that are 
new lazarus said theres no reason to dislike him 
lazarzus said bush runs the risk that he may simply become 
less relevant if he goes along and doesnt do anything and the 
economy starts to look shaky 
cronin the colorado college professor said bush runs the 
risk of having a very vague very murky message and having so many 
minor priorities and not being associated with any major priorities 
that there is no particular theme 
highranking officials from reagans white house speaking 
privately say bush is not doing a good job projecting his goals 
its not so much that he doesnt know what he wants to do 
one official said its how do you enunciate it how do you lay 
it out 
the official said the inexperience of bushs staff was largely 
to blame 
sununu is capable but who does he turn to to ask how does 
this evolve that is a glaring error 
democrats who were bruised by reagans confrontational approach 
have taken a public posture of being delighted with bush praising 
him for cooperating and trying to reestablish trust between the 
white house and congress 
the battle over john towers failed nomination as secretary of 
defense seems forgotten 
hows he done in the first 100 days for those of us in the 
congress who want the system to work its been fabulous said 
rep tony coelho of california the house democratic whip who 
cites bushs agreements with lawmakers on a budget and contra aid 
his success can be tremendous is he keeps this up coelho 
said 
house majority leader tom foley dwash said bushs 
administration has been slow but steady 
in recent years foley said weve gotten into kind of an 
agendasetting mood where we have to have dramatic even theatrical 
kinds of displays he said that approach usually has less 
substance that it has public relations value 
a onetime congressman bush knows how to make lamwkers happy 
the great thing about this guy coelho said i can call 
him and in 15 minutes he calls me back

white house chief of staff john sununu says 
hes learned some things about george bush over the first 100 days 
of his presidency none seems likely to upset his boss 
hes a lot tougher in the clinches with all the respect i had 
for him in the political side of the process when it comes down to 
holding firm on issues hes a lot tougher sununu said in an 
interview 
he is more than anybody else ive seen in washington less 
willing to have his agenda set by the headlines of the day i 
respect that i wasnt sure as we got to the nitty gritty how that 
would go i am amazed by that 
i am amazed at how much at peace with himself he is and really 
knows where he wants to go how he wants to do it there is a 
structure and a discipline to what he wants and how he wants things 
done that consistently shows day to day i respect that i like 
that kind of an orderly approach 
sununu also is an admirer of bushs management style and shrugs 
off criticism that bush has been too cautious reacting too much to 
events instead of initiating things youll always have folks 
that have grand ideas of how something ought to be done but with 
all due respect theyre usually founded on comments shot from the 
hip 
speaking of bush sununu said 
when george bush had to make quick decisions you got them 
you got the savings and loan plan in two weeks you got a budget 
plan laid out on feb 9 you had an opportunity to get an agreement 
with congress on central america and he took advantage of the 
slightest wedge that was presented to him and came up with an 
agreement with congress in a matter or three or four weeks 
every time theres been an opportunity there hes gone out 
and jumped on it and where opportunities do exist for considered 
evaluation you get that too 
it is someone whos got the experience and the sense enough to 
know when you have to act quickly and is willing to act quickly 
the sense enough and the experience enough to know that its just 
not the right time to do something and get more information 
of all things that i think are characterized by what george 
bush has is a sense of good timing as to when a decision has to be 
made when that time comes you get the decision 
so there are some times where he wants detail but once the 
clock moves past the hour at which he thought a decision should be 
made you get the decision and hes not going to be rushed but 
hes not going to be delayed

a washington property developer and a former 
associate of presidents nixon and bush have become the latest 
subjects of speculation about possible buyers for troubled eastern 
airlines 
speculation intensified thursday over a fourth possible suitor 
for eastern union sources said mohamed hadid a real estate 
investor who recently agreed to buy the ritzcarlton hotels in 
washington and new york has contacted easterns striking unions to 
express his interest 
the federal bankruptcy court overseeing easterns 
reorganization which must approve any sale of the miamibased 
airline also has been informed said the sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
speculation in other quarters pointed to frederic v malek a 
former staff member in the nixon administration and bush 
presidential campaign who is a principal of the carlyle group a 
washington investment firm 
the firms vice chairman is former defense secretary frank 
carlucci who reportedly almost was chosen by us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland as a courtappointed trustee to oversee eastern 
malek and carlucci are among the investors buying the coldwell 
banker commercial realestate business from sears roebuck and co 
malek also is part of an investor group vying for northwest 
airlines against billionaire oilman marvin davis 
malek former president of the marriott hotels division of 
marriott corp is a longtime republican party activist and friend 
of president bush he was a senior bush operative on the republican 
national committee but resigned after admitting that he had 
collected information on jewish officials in the bureau of labor 
statistics for president nixon in 1971 
malek denied that his collecting the data had anything to do 
with the jewish officials later demotions 
a secretary at maleks office said he was traveling and 
unavailable to comment ritzcarlton managers in washington 
declined to give hadids telephone number and there were no phone 
listings for him in that city 
the bankruptcy examiner for eastern david i shapiro had asked 
eastern union leaders to meet with him in new york on thursday 
evening sources said but it was unclear what they would discuss 
attorneys for eastern and the unions recently said there are 
four potentially serious suitors for the airline which has been 
grounded by a strike since march 4 it filed for bankruptcy 
protection five days later 
they said the bidders as exbaseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth whose 464 million deal to buy eastern collapsed last 
week takeover strategist carl icahn billionaire hotel executive 
jay pritzker and an unnamed bidder 
frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp 
insisted wednesday that eastern isnt for sale and that there is no 
serious fourth bidder

discussed thursday the carriers financial situation sources close 
to the situation said 
in a sixhour meeting at a manhattan law firm representatives 
of investment firm goldman sachs amp co presented their financial 
review of eastern to the creditors committee said participants in 
the talks who asked not to be identified 
it was nothing earthshattering one participant said 
everyones sort of being held in a limbo situation 
last week shortly before the collapse of ueberroths deal with 
lorenzo the creditors panel had expressed reservations about the 
deal and requested that goldman sachs review easterns financial 
situation 
the creditors committee which includes representatives of 
easterns unions still is waiting to hear managements plan to 
sharply reduce the airlines size and sell some substantial assets 
eastern has not yet presented specifics of the plan to the 
panel lorenzo said wednesday the plan will be presented to 
creditors next week 
lifland has ordered eastern to explain at a hearing monday why 
the airline should not be put up for auction in its entirety

fifty years after televisions debut a 
station has demonstrated the first commercial broadcast of an 
improved tv signal that could show the way for the next generation 
of viewing 
viewers at a research center here were treated thursday to the 
first glimpse of the signal which was used by a new york 
television station to broadcast a segment of its evening news show 
viewers with regular televisions saw little or no difference in 
the signal but it showed up as a bright wide picture on prototype 
sets at the david sarnoff research center center in this university 
town about 50 miles southwest of manhattan 
the broadcast on the anniversary of televisions debut at the 
1939 new york worlds fair was another milestone on the road 
toward a new generation of televisions for the 1990s called 
highdefinition tv that will have nearly the brightness and 
sharpness of magazine pictures 
those sets may not arrive until 1994 or 1995 and initially could 
cost 3000 to 4000 said james tietjen president of the 
research center 
todays broadcast is to television what kitty hawk was to 
flight said michael j sherlock nbcs president for operations 
and technical services 
the broadcast by nbcs new york affiliate wnbctv is part of a 
wave of experimental transmissions recently authorized by the 
federal communications commission 
khjtv an independent station in los angeles on wednesday 
began testing an enhancement of the standard tv signal that is 
intended to remove distortions on the edges of brightly colored 
objects as they appear on regular sets 
at the end of april kblr in las vegas nev is scheduled to 
begin testing a different system for enhancing the signal received 
by standard sets 
in addition more highly advanced television signals have been 
transmitted over channels 58 and 59 in washington dc which are 
lowpowered and exclusively for research purposes 
wnbctv however is the only commercial station that is 
transmitting a signal that can be displayed on special wide screens 
that have the proportions of a movie theater screen 
the system falls short of fullfledged highdefinition 
television because it has to fit into the same narrow portion of 
the broadcast spectrum as the regular television signal does 
engineers say full hdtv will require at least 50 percent more 
band width than regular channels provide 
thursdays test was part of a sixyear 60 million research 
effort at the sarnoff center that is supported by nbc nbcs local 
affiliates nbcs parent general electric co and rca consumer 
electronics which is owned by frances thomson sa 
at one time rca nbc and the sarnoff center were all under the 
same ownership the research center now is operated by sri 
international a menlo park calif nonprofit research concern 
the advanced tv demonstration shown during the news program 
live at five was a videotape from the tournament of roses 
parade that had been recorded on a special video camera 
it was encoded transmitted from the top of new yorks world 
trade cneter and then decoded by the prototype equipment in 
princeton 
wnbc had been quietly testing the system during the early 
morning hours since march 12 according to james carnes the 
sarnoff centers vice president for the consumer electronics and 
information sciences division 
fifty years ago to the day thursday gen david sarnoff 
thenchairman of the radio corp of america the former rca 
introduced television at the new york worlds fair 
the wider sharper picture is squeezed into a standard channel 
with computer techniques the extra side panels are compressed so 
they appear on regular sets as invisibly thin lines along the 
edges the experimental sets decompress those panels to fill up the 
wider screen 
extra detail for the side panels and for the entire picture is 
transmitted in unused spaces in the signal 
when we started this program five years ago 90 percent of the 
scientists in this industry would have said forget it this cant 
be done but we did it said steven bonica a vice president for 
engineering at nbc

nwa inc parent of northwest airlines is 
urging its shareholders to wait for the advice of its board of 
directors before deciding whether to sell shares to marvin davis 
who is appealing to them with a hostile tender offer 
but it would seem unlikely that davis would have many takers at 
90 a share as long as the stock continues to command a higher 
price on the new york stock exchange davis offer announced 
thursday is the same price he offered the board late last month in 
proposing a negotiated deal 
the board rejected the offer as inadequate the company said it 
preferred allcash fully financed offers and davis apparently 
sought to meet that requirement 
on thursday nwa stock closed at 9887 down 62 cents from 
wednesdays recordhigh of 9950 on volume of 157 million shares 
it was the third day of heavy trading in the stock since the nwa 
board said monday it would consider all serious offers for the 
airline the nations fourthlargest alternatively it said it 
would consider selling part of the airline buying back shares 
buying another company or issuing a special dividend to 
shareholders 
northwest based in suburban eagan released a statement 
thursday telling shareholders that the nwa board will review the 
tender offer and make a recommendation to them no later than april 
30 
we are studying mr davis actions kevin whalen nwas 
director of corporate communications said of the hostile takeover 
bid 
the 27 billion tender offer by davis acquisition inc will 
expire at midnight edt on may 17 unless extended 
including related fees the deal could total 31 billion the 
davis group said the group owns 850000 shares of nwa common 
stock or about 28 percent of the total outstanding 
it should be absolutely clear we do not intend to bust up 
the company davis said in a statement our financing 
arrangements will not necessitate the sale of any of nwas airline 
assets and will allow the expansion of the airline and the 
fulfillment of its capital expenditure plans 
in a letter to nwas board davis acquisition reaffirmed its 
willingness to negotiate all aspects of the offer including price 
we hope that the nwa board of directors will determine to 
pursue the sale of the company rather than the other alternatives 
listed in its recent announcement davis said 
since nwa apparently will give serious consideration to the 
other nonsale alternatives we have determined to bring our offer 
directly to the stockholders he added 
davis acquisition said it has obtained a letter from citibank 
and citicorp north america inc stating they would syndicate with a 
group of major banks up to 14 billion of financing for the offer 
with citibank committed to lending up to 500 milion of the amount 
itself 
the company said it hoped to obtain other financing including 
an arrangement of up to 125 billion of preferred stock financing 
by donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
in addition 300 million in common equity would be contributed 
by a davis family partnership with the partnership committed to 
purchase an additional 150 million of junior preferred stock 
state officials have led a campaign to stop a takeover of 
northwest fearing it would lead to the sale of northwest assets 
and a loss of jobs

general motors corps 422 percent firstquarter 
profit surge may not be sustainable especially when the newest 
incentive package takes its toll analysts say 
gm reported thursday that it earned 155 billion or 237 a 
share in the first three months of this year compared with 109 
billion or 156 a share in the same 1988 period 
revenue rose 119 percent to 296 billion from 264 billion 
the nations largest automaker said profits rose because of 
stronger performance in north america and an ongoing costsaving 
program 
really what distinguished the first quarter is that sales 
were not great but they have structured themselves that they can 
make a lot of money at lower sales levels said auto analyst 
jeannette garretty of the bank of america in san francisco 
the quarteroverquarter difference is most dramatic in the 
north american operations she said 
but garretty added she doubted gm could continue its 
firstquarter earnings pace especially as the costs of an 
incentive program gm announced march 30 begin to take hold 
i think its seriously doubtful that incentives will 
generate enough sales to offset the cost of incentives garretty 
said 
during the first three months of this year gms car and light 
truck sales ran 121 percent lower than the same time last year 
the second best year in industry history 
partly because of lowerthanexpected sales gm announced a new 
incentive package on march 30 the package expires june 5 
incentives which can boost sales on a shortterm basis are 
costly for automakers since they assume nearly all financing with 
dealers contributing only a fraction of the total cost 
earnings and revenue figures for 1988 reflect an accounting 
change gm exercised jan 1 1988 the pershare earnings for both 
periods reflect a 2for1 stock split effective march 31 
the company said its north american operations which had been 
lagging recently contributed significantly to firstquarter 
profits gm also said its overseas earnings during the first 
quarter this year exceeded last years record firstquarter profits 
gm spokesman terry sullivan declined to provide specific numbers 
or approximations about gms north american automotive operations 
other than to say they were profitable and up from last year 
the company said it cut costs by about 1 billion in the first 
quarter that brings to 95 billion the amount gm said it has cut 
in a program aimed at slashing 125 billion to 13 billion by the 
end of 1990 
ford is expected to release its firstquarter earnings report 
next week and chrysler in the first week of may

us entertainment giant mca inc has won the 
preliminary court support in a battle to stop a group led by 
cineplex odeon corp from locking up control of the us and 
canadian movie house chain 
the ontario supreme court issued an interim injunction 
prohibiting the group from acquiring shares in the torontobased 
company from sellers led by montreal financier charles bronfman 
mca said thursday in a statement 
cineplex chairman garth drabinsky and his allies cannot buy 
until further order the court said 
officials of los angelesbased mca the biggest single 
shareholder in cineplex and drabinsky could not be reached for 
comment the court order came on the eve of a quebec securities 
commission hearing on the issue 
at the hearing friday mca will seek to block the plans of 
drabinsky and his allies to buy a 30 percent chunk of cineplex 
stock from the bronfman group in a 127million private deal 
announced last week bronfman is cochairman of the seagram co ltd 
in documents mca filed thursday with the us securities and 
exchange commission in washington the company said it might take 
other steps to impede drabinsky from winning control of 
cineplex 
in one of the documents a letter to drabinsky and all cineplex 
board members mca called on the cineplex board to set up a 
committee of the independent directors to rule on the drabinsky 
groups bid and if necessary suggest alternatives 
drabinskys group has said it would settle for 59 million 
shares instead of the 73 million announced last week that would 
leave them with 342 percent of the votes putting them ahead of 
mca 
because of canadian restrictions on foreign ownership imposed 
when mca acquired its 496 percent stake in cineplex in 1986 the 
us company can exercise only onethird of the votes in the 
company minus one share 
mca wants the quebec securities watchdog to refuse to grant the 
exemption the drabinsky group is seeking from having to make a 
comparable 1750ashare offer to other cineplex shareholders

britain on friday conditionally approved the joint 
29 billion bid for plessey co by siemens ag of west germany and 
general electric co plc of britain 
britains monopolies and mergers commission unanimously decided 
that the acquisition of the british electronics company should be 
allowed to proceed provided that the buyers pledge to resolve some 
competition concerns 
earlier this week the european commission said it would clear 
the hostile bid for plessey because it had come to the conclusion 
that the proposed arrangements do not raise objections to ec 
competition rules 
plessey said it would continue to fight the takeover 
the british commission said that in connection with gec it found 
that the merger raised competition concerns in defense radar 
military communications and trafficcontrol equipment 
in addition the commission found that a merger raised concerns 
for competition in a large defense avionics project called jtids 
the commission said there were potential conflicts with national 
security requirements because siemens isnt a britishowned 
company 
the joint bid for plessey values each plessey share at 385 
making the total bid worth 29 billion 
gec and plessey had no immediate comment on the commissions 
findings 
in february gec and siemens revised their takeover plans for 
running plesseys politically sensitive defensecontracting 
business in an effort to appease british defense and antitrust 
officials 
the commission said it would obtain commitments from gec and 
siemens they wont acquire any interest in or influence or control 
over the management of plesseys radar and military communications 
businesses and plesseys traffic control activities 
in addition gec and siemens must ensure that access to 
technology and licenses for production of jtids equipment are made 
available to any competitor nominated by the british ministry of 
defense 
in order to comply with national security requirements 
arrangements for ownership and management of plesseys defense 
research and development and semiconductors businesses will need 
approval of trade secretary lord young 
young asked gec and siemens for assurances as soon as possible 
and said the proposed acquisition shouldnt proceed until they are 
received

tighter pentagon budgets mean defense contractors 
are facing tough times in the short term texas instruments inc 
executives said in reporting a firstquarter earnings decline 
we are very optimistic about the future of our defense 
electronics business in the next decade chairman jerry r 
junkins told shareholders thursday but we must be realistic 
about the nearterm environment 
its going to be a tougher period for defense contractors in 
general and it means lower nearterm growth in our business he 
said 
dallasbased texas instruments provides various electronic 
missile and radar systems for the army navy and air force and 
recently won contracts that could bring the company as much as 11 
billion in revenue over the severalyear life of the deal 
but the company on thursday reported slightly lower earnings for 
the first three months of this year in part because defense 
revenues were down 5 percent from the comparable 1988 quarter 
the company said it had net income of 846 million or 90 cents 
a share on sales of 156 billion in the first three months of the 
year 
that compares to 855 million or 95 cents a share on sales of 
147 billion in the same 1988 period the company said the lower 
pershare earnings were due to increased dividends paid on 
preferred stock 
junkins told analysts not to base their conclusions about the 
companys defense business on a quartertoquarter comparison 
because of the longterm payback of some of the ongoing research 
projects 
texas instruments said it will spend more than 1 billion on 
research and development and capital expansion during this year 
junkins said the company will spend 525 million on research and 
development and 760 million in capital expenditures 127 million 
was spent in the first quarter on research and another 150 million 
on capital projects 
chief financial officer william aylesworth said the research 
will focus on improvements in logic devices on the semiconductor 
side and in improving radar technology for defense systems 
texas instrument which had 1988 earnings of 3663 million on 
sales of 629 billion is a major manufacturer of semiconductors 
besides defense electronic systems its businesses include computer 
systems various electrical systems and consumer electronics

the west german central bank today raised rates on shortterm 
treasury notes a day after its surprise hike in the discount rate 
a move that rattled us financial markets 
separately the central bank in belgium raised interest on five 
key lending rates mirroring thursdays moves by west germanys 
bundesbank as well as rate increases announced by the central banks 
of austria and denmark 
the bundesbanks initial actions jolted financial markets in the 
united states where wall street suffered a selloff bond prices 
slipped and the dollar lost substantial ground 
in early trading today however the dollar was mixed and bond 
prices were holding firm traders continued to look for indications 
as to whether britain and japan would follow with rate increases of 
their own 
analysts said they expected the dow jones industrial average 
which lost nearly 10 points on thursday to bounce back 
the unsettling of financial markets began when the bundesbank 
raised west germanys discount rate to 45 percent from 40 percent 
and the lombard rate the effective ceiling on overnight loans 
between banks to 65 percent from 60 percent 
today the central bank set shortterm treasury note rates at 50 
percent up from 45 percent effective immediately a bundesbank 
spokesman said the rate on the notes whose maturity is between 3 
and 4 days usually is set in accordance with the discount rate 
domestic overnight rates also rose 
a dealer at a major west german bank said the market is all 
confused and nervous following the unexpected shift in the rates 
although market liquidity remains sufficient he said there were 
too many question marks about the bundesbanks behavior which 
made shortterm rates unstable 
belgiums national bank said it was raising its discount and 
lombard rates by a half a percentage point each as well as hiking 
rates on treasury bills following changes in interest rates 
abroad belgium usually follows changes in interest rates in west 
germany a key trading partner 
the new discount rate takes effect monday the other rates took

percent in the first quarter of 1988

corporate takeover artist t boone pickens has 
raided japan leaving business leaders suspicious and wondering 
whether americans like him want to buy their companies just as the 
japanese have done in the united states 
however the difficulties the texas oilman has encountered with 
the subtleties and intricacies of japanese business suggest pickens 
himself is far from being a threat to japans leading companies 
pickens has purchased shares worth about 1 billion in koito 
manufacturing co a major auto parts maker surpassing toyota 
motor to become the largest shareholder but despite owning 202 
percent of koito its management politely turned down pickens 
request this week for a seat on the board of directors 
it is necessary to build a trusting relationship first in 
japan it is not possible to just say im a major shareholder 
and get a seat on the board right away koito director tamotsu 
aoyama told a news conference thursday 
pickens in his first visit to tokyo challenged what analysts 
consider two central tenets of japanese business culture that a 
company belongs to its employees not its shareholders and that 
the japanese market is for japanese not foreigners to enjoy 
pickens argued in a speech that protecting shareholders rights 
by using corporate buyouts to oust incompetent management helped 
resuscitate the us economy over the last nine years 
what happened in the us in the 1980s will find its way to 
the japanese business community in the 1990s he predicted 
but many japanese businessmen hope that will not happen these 
businessmen believe the american emphasis on return to shareholders 
has caused us companies to lose competitiveness to japanese 
companies 
japanese companies dont generally have to answer to 
shareholders with shortterm profits they can focus on longerterm 
growth said keith donaldson an analyst at james capel pacific 
ltd just look at these two economies to see which approach has 
been more successful 
but even if japan doesnt like pickens advice it cant afford 
to ignore him because he tied his shareholders crusade to trade 
issues 
pickens told reporters that people in washington are watching 
carefully whether he is able to invest in japan he said he was 
concerned that american investors dont have the same access in 
japan as japanese have in the us 
while japanese companies have invested billions of dollars in 
the united states some of it actively wooed by american states 
eager for jobs us companies find it very difficult to invest in 
japan analysts said 
however companies such as federal express have broken into 
fastgrowing japanese markets by purchasing stakes in japanese 
companies in the same line of business working hard to establish 
themselves by putting down local roots 
but many japanese perceive pickens as making an attempt at 
greenmail taking a company hostage with the intention of selling 
it at a profit rather than managing it for the long run 
this is a bad example of an american acquisition a 
corporate activist with no expertise in the business buying up 
shares in a company said yoshihisa murasawa a consultant with 
booz allen hamilton japan inc 
mergers and acquisitions have shown signs of picking up the 
number of securities firms have been reduced through such tactics 
from 600 a decade ago to 250 today murasawa said 
but he said japanese lack a habit of buying and selling 
companies 
its even harder for a japanese company than an american to 
acquire another selling companies is seen as something like 
selling family

events in the north sea and alaska are diverting 
the oil markets attention from factors that normally would be 
driving prices down analysts said as crude leaped another 2 a 
barrel 
meanwhile officials of shell uk ltd operator of a platform 
that exploded in the north sea this week said thursday that 
inspection of the damage is continuing but declined to say when 
normal operations would resume 
the gas explosion at the cormorant alpha platform tuesday halted 
production of nearly 500000 barrels of oil or onequarter of 
total production from the brent oil fields 
crude prices have surged more than 3 a barrel or almost 15 
percent since the accident 
with brent being a major crude it has people scared said 
peter beutel an energy analyst with elders futures inc its 
possible there wont be any may deliveries 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude soared 204 
to finish at 2465 a barrel the highest level in more than three 
years the last time the nearmonth contract was higher was on jan 
15 1986 
the 204 rise topped a 174 hike on aug 4 1986 to become 
the largest oneday increase since trading of crude futures began 
on the new york mercantile exchange in march 1983 
beutel said that buyers anxious to take positions on the may 
contract before it expired thursday also drove prices higher 
in early trading today the june contract opened lower then 
rebounded slightly after closing at 2128 on thursday the 
contract was trading between 2093 and 2133 a barrel before 
midday edt 
because gasoline prices have already increased in recent weeks 
in response to the alaskan oil spill the latest jump in crude 
prices may have only a minimal impact at the consumer level unless 
the pipeline shutdown is prolonged analysts said 
thursdays frenzied buying was triggered by a comment from 
british energy minister cecil parkinson that the oil field shutdown 
could last up to a month 
the closure affects several major oil companies that pump oil 
through the station those include exxon corp with about 85000 
barrels a day shut in amoco corp with 10000 and conoco inc 
with 24000 
analysts said factors that normally would have driven prices 
down during this period overproduction by opec and a softening in 
demand during the second quarter had been pushed to the 
background 
but once north sea operations return to normal and as the 
alaskan spill fades from peoples minds prices could fall back 
below 20 a barrel they said 
the market is so overbought due to the psychological impact of 
these events that theres a lot of room for a fall in prices 
said ken miller an analyst with the petroleum consulting firm of 
purvin amp gertz inc the fundamentals dont support the prices 
among refinedproduct trading thursday on the new york 
mercantile exchange the price of unleaded gasoline for may 
delivery rose 003 cent to 7464 cents a gallon while the may 
heating oil contract fell 104 cents to 5229 cents a gallon 
despite the recent accidents an actual shortage of oil or 
gasoline is more anticipation than reality market observers said 
the department of energy recently revised its figures to show 
that demand is actually lower than thought and opec is believed to 
be producing more than 205 million barrels of oil a day 2 million 
barrels above its selfimposed quota and about a million barrels 
more than needed to meet demand 
so while the north sea and alaska problems have caused temporary 
disruptions there is no evidence of a shortage of oil and gasoline 
to meet current world demand analysts said

jump in firstquarter profits despite a decline in the food and 
consumer products companys dairy division

590 million or 80 cents a share up from 524 million or 71 
cents a share in the yearago first quarter

from 16 billion a year ago

the greatest gain with operating income up 265 percent operating 
income from the worldwide packaging and industrial products 
division rose 215 percent based on income gains from the sales of 
forest products adhesives industrial resins and specialty coatings 
bordens grocery and specialty products division reported a 13 
percent rise in operating income during the quarter boosted by 
sales of creamette and other regional pasta brands krylon spray 
paint and elmers glue 
those gains worked to offset a 36 percent decline in operating 
income posted by the dairy division which borden said was hit by 
continued increases in raw milk costs and tougher competition that 
that worked to drive down profit margins

the company is just beginning to turn around the troubled dairy 
division since july the company has eliminated 15 plants and

a tank ruptured and spilled at least 
180000 gallons of oily waste water into grand river today as a 
barge was being unloaded at a waste disposal site in southern 
louisiana authorities said 
the tank on the barge was carrying 900000 gallons of 
nonhazardous oily waste from the exxonhouston facility for 
disposal by gsx land treatment of white castle state police said 
environmental officials from exxon tell us that the material 
is about 90 percent water 7 percent alcohol and 3 percent oil 
said lt ronnie jones of the state police 
no one was injured jones said 
the spill happened at a remote area about 35 miles southwest of 
baton rouge on the edge of the atchafalaya basin a vast hardwood 
swamp and marshland that is a breeding ground for a variety of fish 
and wildlife 
the barge is owned by palmer co of port arthur texas and 
leased by gsx exxon had no responsibility for the barge after it 
left the texas site said freddie pitre sheriff of iberville 
parish 
we were unloading the waste when the barge buckled an unknown 
quantity spilled into grand river we havent determined the 
cause said bobby mayweather manager of environmental safety for 
gsx we had unloaded 260000 gallons and we believe about 180000 
gallons spilled 
state police estimated the spill at between 300000 and 400000 
gallons 
jones said crews quickly surrounded the spill with booms 
adding we believe weve got most of the material contained in 
one area 
mayweather said that the remainder of the waste will be emptied 
into tanker trucks later today paul dubois a spokesman for the 
palmer co said a water and alcohol mixture commonly known in the 
oil industry as slop water is used to wash out tanks and 
ships when its dirty with oil residue it becomes waste water he 
said 
john reidy a spokesman for exxon said officials at their new 
orleans headquarters had little information about the spill but 
would have a statement as soon as possible 
jones said there is little chance of fire or explosion but 
from an environmental standpoint this could be a dangerous 
spill anytime you get 400000 gallons of anything into a river 
youve got a serious situation 
the incident comes four weeks after an exxon oil tanker hit a 
reef and ruptured in the waters off alaska spewing 10 million 
gallons of crude oil the worst oil spill in us history 
after todays spill exxon dispatched a cleanup crew from new 
orleans the department of environmental quality and other state 
agencies were also sent to the site jones said 
stanley jackson of the office of emergency preparedness for 
iberville parish said it doesnt seem that bad and its not a 
significant spill but you cant convince the people around here of 
that 
the tank ruptured about 4 am the barge was carrying three 
tanks of the waste jones said workers removed the tanks from both 
ends of the barge causing the barge to buckle and rupture the 
middle tank jones said 
at sunup the alcohol was evaporating jones said leaving only 
the oil to be cleaned up if the waste is 3 percent oil 180000 
gallons of waste would contain 5600 gallons of oil while 300000 
to 400000 gallons would include 9000 to 12000 gallons of oil 
jones said the spill left no visible sheen on the water because 
the material was so thoroughly emulsified more mixed up that 
is with water and air and bubbles 
the grand is a slowmoving river so there has not been a 
tremendous amount of movement of the material jones said

soybean futures prices surged in early trading 
today on the chicago board of trade reflecting strong european 
demand for soybean meal and reduced prospects for rain in the 
midwest next week 
corn futures were moderately higher in early trading and wheat 
futures were up slightly 
the firming of european soybean meal markets turned up the heat 
on simmering fears of tight us soybean supplies which are at 
relatively low levels as a result of last summers drought 
the possibility of a second drought year is keeping the soybean 
and corn markets on edge although planting of those crops in the 
midwest has barely begun 
some private meterorologists reduced the chances for rain in the 
corn belt in their morning forecasts triggering active buying of 
newcrop corn and soybean futures 
a 12dayold dock workers strike at brazils port of santos is 
also having a positive impact on soybean prices brazil is the 
worlds secondlargest soybean producer after the united states 
forecasts for hot dry weather in the central plains continue to 
support the wheat futures market 
in early trading wheat was cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 410 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 4 cents higher with may at 275 a bushel oats were 2 cents 
to 3 cents higher with may at 200 a bushel soybeans were 5 
cents to 11 cents higher with may at 758 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher on the chicago 
mercantile exchange ahead of two agriculture department reports due 
later today the quarterly cattleonfeed report and the monthly 
coldstorage report 
live cattle settled 15 cent lower to 15 cent higher with june 
at 7115 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 48 
cent higher with may at 7610 cents a pound live hogs were 05 
cent to 30 cent higher with june at 4552 cents a pound frozen

managers of the three mile island nuclear 
power plant offered the nuclear regulatory commission a detailed 
look at what will happen if the facilitys crippled unit 2 is 
mothballed which the company hopes to do by the end of next year 
the nrc said during a 90minute meeting thursday that it 
expected to complete a study on the environmental impact of the 
plan and release the assessment in the next few months 
the plants unit 2 reactor was disabled in the nations worst 
commercial nuclear accident on march 31 1979 the reactor was 
allowed to lose the vital cooling water that normally covers it 
causing fuel and other components in the radioactive core to begin 
melting 
the plants undamaged unit 1 reactor was not affected by the 
1979 accident has been operating since 1985 
on thursday officials of gpu nuclear the plants operator 
provided the nrc with an updated picture of unit 2s future over 
the next 30 years 
in socalled monitored storage the unit 2 reactor building 
would be locked up unneeded systems deactivated and the reactor 
left idle for up to 30 years while radiation decays the unit would 
then be dismantled 
while insufficient fuel would be present to support a nuclear 
chain reaction relatively high levels of contamination would 
remain in the reactor building basement during storage plant 
officials said radiation monitoring will be continued and a 
security force will control access 
the nrc is still studying the environmental impact of the plan 
and commission chairman lando zech said at the meeting that its 
report was due in june the plan must also pass a separate safety 
evaluation said tmi spokesman doug bedell 
plant officials originally had hoped to have unit 2 mothballed 
by the end of 1989 but a threemonth delay in removing damaged 
fuel combined with changes in the decontamination schedule has 
pushed the beginning of the reactors storage phase toward the 
end of 1990 with better than 99 percent of its nuclear fuel 
removed gpu nuclear said 
gpu nuclear president philip clark told the nrc that the company 
had sufficient resources people and money to ensure the plant 
could safely be placed in storage next year 
zech asked the company to formulate as specific a schedule as 
possible for ending the cleanup 
gpu nuclear said at the meeting the cleanup is expected to be 
completed within its 1 billion target the operator said more than 
threequarters of the 150 tons of damaged fuel and other debris 
have been shipped off the site and the reactors workforce is to 
be trimmed from 960 last year to 250 in 1990

ashland oil inc said friday it lost 14 million in the second 
quarter due mainly to the steep rise in crude prices and the 
settlement of a longstanding dispute 
ashlands loss amounted to 25 cents a share in the three months 
ended march 31 in last years second quarter the ashland 
kybased company had net earnings of 21 million or 37 cents a 
share 
revenue totaled 19 billion roughly the same as the second 
quarter of 1988 
ashland chairman john r hall said the latest results were not 
unexpected after the sharp rise in crude oil costs a major 
refinery slowdown and the settlement of a longstanding dispute 
involving its riley stoker corp subsidiary and cajun electric 
power of baton rouge la 
the quarters results reflect a 9 million charge stemming from 
the settlement or about 15 cents of the pershare loss said 
ashland spokesman wp hartl 
the dispute dating back to the 1970s involved an alleged 
breach of contract by stoker of worcester mass in designing and 
installing two coalfired steam generators the spokesman said 
the march quarter historically is our most difficult period 
hall said the jump in world crude prices of abut 10 a barrel 
since last november or about 24 cents a gallon also hurt the 
companys profits he said 
in addition earnings were adversely affected by a seasonal 
maintenance slowdown at ashlands catlettsburg ky refinery 
which resulted in lower sales volumes 
product prices did not keep pace with rising raw material 
costs and refinery margins were compressed hall said 
as a result of these factors ashland petroleum had a 19 
million operating loss he said 
for the six months ended march 31 ashlands net income totaled 
82 million or 148 a share up 34 percent from 61 million or 
108 a share in the previous six months 
revenue totaled 41 billion compared with 39 billion in the 
same 1988 period 
the onset of the driving season and expected tightness in the 
gasoline market however should boost refinery profit margins 
through the remainder of the year hall said

it was just a simple bond sale by a north 
carolina electric company but it erupted into a controversy on 
wall street that touched sensitive nerves and threatened to change 
forever the bond market 
the auction of the 100 million bond issue by carolina power amp 
light co almost broke the monopoly that investment houses enjoy 
over the rights to bid on public debt issues 
but at the last minute metropolitan life insurance co the 
renegade bidder pulled out of the auction apparently under 
pressure from the four wall street bidders in the race 
the only party willing to comment after the dust settled on 
wednesdays auction was met life which said it had no qualms about 
its action and would do it again 
what met life did was to put in a bid for the bonds which were 
destined to be sold on the open market the issuers of such bonds 
traditionally hold an auction to sell the bonds to a wall street 
firm which in turn sells the bonds to the public at a markup 
but met life wanted the bonds for its own investment purposes 
by law insurance companies are barred from selling bonds or other 
securities to the public 
insurance companies traditionally buy new bond issues through 
socalled private placements or issues that arent designed for 
the public market with private placements the insurance company 
agrees to buy an entire block of bonds from the utility company or 
other issuer in turn the buyer often has a say in how the bonds 
are structured 
apparently met life persuaded carolina power to include 
antitakeover provisions called protective covenants in the 
bonds which made them attractive to the life insurance giant 
takeovers are a major concern of met life and other insurers 
who have seen the value of some of their bonds plummet after the 
company that issued them was bought in a leveraged buyout 
in particular met life was burned when its rjr nabisco inc 
bonds turned into junk bonds after the leveraged buyout of the food 
and tobacco giant earlier this year by kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co met life has filed a lawsuit against rjr and kkr over the 
matter 
protective covenants to guard against a loss in bond value due 
to takeovers or event risks traditionally are included in 
privately placed bonds said paul reardon director of investment 
research for the american council of life insurance 
there werent many event risk losses on private placements 
because there were protective covenants written in reardon said 
but the four wall street firms bidding on the carolina power 
bonds shearson lehman hutton inc morgan stanley amp co goldman 
sachs amp co and merrill lynch amp co apparently would not have 
received the same safeguards an hour before the auction met life 
said it was told that its bid would not be accepted by carolina 
power according to the wall street journal wall sreet firms 
applied pressure on the utility to reject the bid 
after the met life bid was rejected morgan stanley won the 
right to sell the bonds carolina power said 
met life said it wasnt deterred by the experience and would 
make bids on public bond issues in the future 
that statement is significant because insurance companies own 
about half of all outstanding debt issues should other insurers 
follow met lifes path it could signal a fundamental change in the 
way bond issues are written and sold in this country 
such a change would further erode the territory of the wall 
street giants whose securities business already is threatened by 
moves to allow banks and other institutions to sell securities and 
it could further cut into their profits which have been slumping 
due to the decline in interest in stocks following the market crash 
of october 1987

milken from the wharton schools hall of fame if he is convicted of 
fraud and racketeering 
if hes found guilty i think they should yank him out said 
tom tziavragos who will graduate this year and if hes a crook 
im all for his going to jail i think most of my classmates feel 
that way 
milken has given 225 million to wharton since his 1978 
graduation spokeswoman margaret barry said milken is one of 16 
hall of fame members whose photographs hang in steinberg 
halldietrich hall on the university of pennsylvania campus 
sophomore lauren krasnow said his continuing presence on the

including realestate mogul donald trump supreme court justice 
william brennan and the buildings namesake financier saul 
steinberg 
wharton spokeswoman denise portner said milkens portrait will 
stay at least for now 
we dont think it is up to us to decide whether he is innocent 
or guilty she said that is a matter for the courts 
the hall of fame members were chosen by student ballot several 
years ago

in the universe of financial affairs the 
cincinnati stock exchange is a dwarf star in an oddball galaxy the 
only stock exchange in the world where all trades are executed by a 
computer 
but on some day in the next 19 months a switch will be thrown 
and marketwatchers will train their telescopes on cincinnati to 
observe what many foresee as the dawn of a new age the era of 
24hour stock trading 
there will be no daily opening or close at least not as we know 
them today and there will be no floor crowded with noisy jostling 
traders there will be only the computer humming clicking and 
beeping as it matches buy and sell orders streaming in from points 
all over the globe 
such is the hope of the cincinnati exchange and its partners in 
the venture the chicago board options exchange and londonbased 
reuters holdings plc which jointly announced their plans in march 
but the 24hour stock market is not a universal vision it has 
not been a goal publicly pursued by the new york stock exchange 
for example although the nations biggest stock market suggested 
this past week it was considering a way to trade stocks 
electronically when the floor is closed 
to the extent that a customer has a need in the offhours 
this institution has a commitmenmt to meet that need richard 
grasso nyse president and chief operating officer told the wall 
street journal 
the electronictrading movement is a response to the 
increasingly global nature of financial investing the smaller the 
world gets the greater the search becomes among exchanges for ways 
to capture business from overseas 
the cincinnati stock exchange which averages 1 million trades 
per day compared with 170 million per day on the new york stock 
exchange turned totally automated in 1976 
other us exchanges have computerized parts of their operations 
but thus far the switch to automated execution which many see as a 
prerequisite to 24hour trading has been carried on exclusively by 
foreign exchanges the toronto stock exchange the tokyo stock 
exchange and a host of european financial markets use computers to 
execute at least part of their orders 
chicagos commodity futures and options exchanges have recently 
taken the electronictrading lead in the united states the chicago 
board options exchange owns a controlling interest in the 
cincinnati stock exchange the chicago mercantile exchange will 
launch its afterhours automatedexecution system called globex 
this fall in partnership with reuters and the chicago board of 
trade the worlds largest futures market is working on an unusual 
hybrid trading system called aurora designed to recreate on a 
computer screen the characteristics of a commodities trading pit 
its so obvious that this is coming 24hoursaday electronic 
trading everywhere its just a matter of time said peter 
schwartz president of global business network a small research 
and consulting company based in emeryville calif that helped the 
london stock exchange develop a computerization strategy 
but eric k clemons an associate professor at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school specializing in computer and 
financial issues says that while the new york stock exchange 
probably could convert successfully to roundtheclock trading it 
would require a massive investment in new technology and i dont 
see it as an improvement over what the exchange has today 
what the new york stock exchange has today is an electronic 
delivery system that routes orders to the exchange floor where 
they are handled by professional market makers called specialists 
its almost a cybernetic system a manmachine synthesis and 
i think it works very well clemons said 
proponents of electronic trading say the specialist system for 
stock trading the raucous openoutcry auction tradition of the 
commodity markets and virtually every other trading system in which 
humans execute customer orders will inevitably be replaced by 
computers that can perform the same task faster and cheaper while 
keeping flawless records 
i dont see how youre going to stop the march of technology 
any more than the people who made slide rules stopped the march of 
computers said junius peake a capital markets expert at the 
peakeryerson consulting group inc of englewood nj 
sophisticated institutional investors face an everexpanding 
smorgasbord of opportunities they trade us stocks in new york 
currency futures in chicago yen bonds in tokyo british pounds in 
london 
financial markets have responded by broadening their own 
offerings to include products that once were traded only in their 
home countries stocks such as ibm general motors and matsushita 
electric have become world class stocks traded on exchanges 
both at home and abroad 
still japanese investors prefer to trade ibm in new york and 
most american players want to trade matsushita in tokyo because the 
markets for those stocks are larger at home than abroad 
the more players there are in a given market the more likely an 
investor is to find someone willing to take the opposite side of 
his trade at the price he wants this is called market liquidity 
and investors tend to trade in the most liquid market available 
but the most liquid market is not always open when its morning 
in tokyo its evening in new york so japanese investors seeking 
to trade ibm in new york where they are likely to get the best 
deal must wait for the new york stock exchange to open 
a 24hour electronic trading system would provide easy access to 
the market but critics say there is no guarantee of liquidity 
with no specialists on hand to take the opposing side of the trade 
the order would dangle there waiting for an opposing order to 
arrive 
thats not what investors seek in a market 
liquidity follows liquidity and people dont trade where 
people dont trade clemons said 
thus the greatest challenge facing electronic markets is simply 
getting enough people to use them 
reuters which has 170000 computer terminals in use by traders 
and brokers worldwide has been highly successful in getting people 
to use its electronic products which range from pricequotation 
machines to an offexchange trading network called instinet 
but spokesman robert crooke said human behavior not technology 
will ultimately determine the shape of tomorrows financial markets 
each system whether completely automated partially automated 
or in fact fully human has its advantages and its place and that 
place will always be dictated by the markets themselves crooke 
said

setting up shop in tokyo could cost a whopping 
186 a square foot while the same amount of space in kuala lumpur 
takes the small sum of 12 says a new survey listing average 
prices of office space around the world 
the survey released friday by colliers international property 
consultants isnt intended to make the japanbound change course 
for malaysia but it does offer a guide to budgeting space and 
funds said colliers president stewart forbes 
essentially we want to get some sense of how different markets 
compare and to be able to provide that to clients who are 
increasingly active in a global market he said somebody going 
from boston to tokyo needs to budget not on the basis of boston 
rents but on tokyo 
rounding out the top 10 were london 152 hong kong 102 
beijing 78 paris 59 sydney 58 zurich 50 boston 48 
new york 47 washington dc 47 and moscow 46 
costs gathered partly through consultants and partly through 
the 1500 real estate professionals linked to bostonbased 
colliers include average rent and operating expenses such as 
electricity bills 
half of the 54 cities surveyed had rents ranging from 20 to 34 
per square foot 
the business of finding overseas locations for us firms has 
boomed over the past five years said forbes 
real estate has always been sort of a local business its 
almost been provincial in its outlook but as client needs became 
global so too have local real estate firms forbes said 
jim montanari vice president of new yorkbased cushman and 
wakefield also involved in overseas commercial real estate said 
the surveys top 10 matches his experience with finding office 
space although he said he would probably place new york before 
boston 
the biggest headache in renting office space abroad is learning 
to deal with fewer resources and accepting such constraints as an 
average 1 percent office vacancy rate in tokyo montanari said 
were used to having multiple choices he said people 
doing this for the first time its sort of shocking he said 
forbes said the survey tried to stay away from broad averages by 
addressing the specific area of prime downtown locations for 10000 
square feet for a period of five years beginning may 1989 
other findings of the survey included 
us cities at the bottom of the spectrum included dallas 30 
and denver 32 both in the throes of overbuilding and 
energyrelated recession shocks at 13 and 12 a square foot 
respectively 
seattle kansas city and jakarta tied for 27th at about 20 
rounding out the us top 10 were philadelphia 41 chicago 
40 los angeles 31 atlanta 30 baltimore and san francisco 
29 minneapolis 28 detroit 26 and fort lauderdale 25

several corporate heavy hitters weighed in with 
their firstquarter financial results this past week and most 
figures tipped the scales close to where the companies intended 
a grim performance by rjr nabisco inc may have been expected 
due to its 25 billion buyout by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co but 
that didnt make the news any easier to bear 
the company said it shouldered 247 million in socalled 
change of control costs including severance pay pension plan 
benefits and other payments to executives leaving on account of the 
buyout 
rjr nabisco shareholders are expected to approve the deal with 
kohlberg kravis at a special meeting on thursday 
the flop of rjr nabiscos premier smokeless cigarette which was 
recently yanked from test market store shelves because consumers 
rejected the brand also had something to do with the earnings 
slump 
the company said its aftertax income in the january through 
march period amounted to 103 million down 62 percent from 273 
million in the same quarter a year ago 
sales in the quarter were up 5 percent to 4 billion from 38 
billion in 1988 
without the buyoutrelated costs and a charge for abandoning the 
premier tests net income would have been up 17 percent to 320 
million in the first quarter 
the leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco is setting precedents for 
costs associated with these deals in which a target companys 
assets and cash flow typically are tapped to finance the 
transaction 
for rjr nabisco further costs could show up in subsequent 
earnings statements 
the buyout was expected to impair rjr nabiscos profitability 
but the magnitude of the effect in the first quarter was a surprise 
to some analysts 
among other companies posting results general motors corp 
reported a 422 percent firstquarter profit gain reflecting 
improvements in north american automobile operations and continued 
costsaving measures 
the nations largest company said it earned 155 billion or 
237 per share in the three months ended march 31 up from 109 
billion or 156 per share for the same 1988 period revenue rose 
119 percent to 296 billion from 264 billion 
american telephone amp telegraph co reported a 207 percent rise 
in firstquarter earnings to 594 million or 55 cents a share 
from 492 million or 46 cents a share as revenue rose 32 percent 
to 866 billion from 839 billion atampt benefited from growth in 
international sales of products and services plus a surge in 
longdistance calling 
bankamerica corp said its net income soared 152 percent in the 
first quarter underscoring the strength of the big bank holding 
companys recovery firstquarter profit rose to a record 275 
million or 138 a share from the prior years 109 million 56 
cents a share the parent of bank of america lost 955 million in 
1987 and rebounded last year to post a profit of 726 million 
in other business and economic news during the week 
drexel burnham lambert inc announced a major restructuring 
that involves the sale of its retail brokerage operation and a 
reduction of as much as onethird in the number of its employees 
separately a federal appeals court unexpectedly delayed 
approval of the settlement between drexel and the securities and 
exchange commission of securities fraud charges sec chairman david 
ruder hinted the agency may still take action against drexel chief 
executive officer frederick joseph 
billionaire oilman marvin davis took his bid for nwa inc 
directly to stockholders by offering 90 a share in cash in a 
hostile takeover deal that could total 31 billion including 
related fees the offer for the parent of northwest airlines the 
nations fourth largest carrier expires at midnight may 17 
the labor department reported the consumer price index rose 05 
percent in march and increased at a 61 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter although it was the fastest pace since the 63 
percent rate in 1987s first quarter the financial markets rallied 
on the news because the numbers were better than expected

the cocacola co pursuing a strategy of joint 
ventures with overseas corporations said friday it plans to 
acquire at least 41 percent of the australian food and tobacco 
giant amatil ltd 
coke said it expects to pay 328 million for its stake in 
amatil which had revenue last year of about 17 billion 
the acquisition is part of a proposed restructuring of amatil 
in which the australian company plans to concentrate on its soft 
drink and snack food business and spin off its tobacco interests 
into a new company 
the deal has been approved by the boards of coke amatil and 
bat industries which is amatils largest shareholder and is 
subject to the approval of amatil shareholders and australian 
regulatory authorities 
amatil is one of the largest cocacola bottlers in the world and 
one of australias largest companies 
beginning in 1981 cocacola began aligning itself with bottlers 
and other companies in foreign countries in an effort to expand 
business in the growing international soft drink market said coke 
spokesman randy donaldson 
cokes major overseas ventures have been in the philippines 
united kingdom taiwan thailand canada and the netherlands 
cokes latest earnings report for the quarter ended march 31 
showed continuing growth in the companys international business 
with retail case sales up 8 percent and shipments of concentrate 
and syrup up 6 percent over the same period a year earlier 
donaldson said 75 percent of cokes operating income comes from 
overseas 
soft drink industry analysts said the proposed amatil deal was a 
good move for coke 
amatil is a powerhouse operation really first class said 
emanuel goldman an industry analyst with painewebber inc in san 
francisco australia is a dynamite market for cocacola 
goldman said the overseas market for colas is soaring and the 
amatil venture is consistent with cokes international strategy in 
the 1980s he said it probably would not be the last of such deals 
for atlantabased coke 
goldman said amatil is a leader in the australian snack foods 
industry and cocacola likely would play a minor role in the 
daytoday operation of the company 
lawrence adelman an analyst with dean witter reynolds in new 
york said australia is a pretty good market for coke with per 
capita consumption of 195 eightounce bottles a year us 
consumption of coke is 42 gallons per person per year donaldson 
said 
with amatil focusing on its soft drink and food business under 
the restructuring there is potential for growth adelman said 
already he said they account for the bulk of cocacolas 
operations in australia 
goldman said cokes expansion overseas could have the ironic 
effect of benefiting its competitors namely chief rival pepsi 
cola by paving the way for increased cola consumption around the 
world 
pepsi would be in a good position to benefit from the growth 
of soft drinks overseas he said coke doing well will be good 
for pepsi because more people will be drinking colas 
donaldson said however that cocacola competes with more than 
just pepsi overseas in germany for example the soft drink maker 
is up against the popularity of beer and in italy coke is trying 
to win the hearts and taste buds of wine lovers 
we position our international competition as a battle for the 
share of stomachs he said

soybean futures prices closed sharply higher and 
grain futures also advanced friday on the chicago board of trade as 
the weather outlook turned drier for the midwest and great plains 
soybean futures also were supported by the slow movement of 
brazilian soybean meal to europe a function of a 12dayold 
dockworkers strike at the port of santos brazils largest harbor 
but weather was the dominant factor and it is certain to remain 
the key variable in the markets with corn planting expected to 
begin in earnest this weekend in the midwest 
weather forecasts will become even more critical when soybean 
planting commences in several more weeks 
soybeans need more moisture to get started than corn does 
said walter spilka a grain market analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york when you see dry forecasts 
youre likely to see a better runup in the soybean market 
predictions for continued dry weather in the great plains 
bolstered wheat prices the kansas wheat crop has already sustained 
significant dryweather damage and without rain theres no doubt 
the crop will continue to deteriorate spilka said 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 415 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 5 cents higher with may at 275 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 
5 cents higher with may at 202 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents 
to 11 cents higher with may at 759 a bushel

the procter amp gamble co hopes its move to use 
recycled plastic in some of its products sets an example for the 
rest of the industry 
the cincinnatibased company announced thursday it is test 
marketing four of its major liquid laundry and cleaning products in 
bottles partially made of recycled plastic 
pampgs message is that plastics are recyclable too and should 
be added to all recycling programs said company spokesman t 
scott stewart we want to promote development of a nationwide 
program to collect process and recycle plastics in consumer 
packaging 
the company is test marketing its liquid tide and cheer laundry 
detergents downy fabric softner and spic and span household 
cleaner in bottles containing 20 percent to 30 percent recycled 
plastic the bottles are being test marketed in the states of 
washington oregon and montana 
all four products are being rolled out now toward the 
northwest stewart said 
not only is the northwest farthest in distance it also 
represents informed areas relative to recycling seattle has a 
curbside program in which paper glass and aluminum are collected 
separate from the trash he said 
successful testmarketing of the bottles eventually could mean 
the substitution of 20 million to 30 million pounds of new plastic 
and recycled material annually according to pampg the company hopes 
it is the beginning of a major effort by companies to increase the 
use of recycled plastics 
pampg said it has been working with various companies to produce 
the recycled plastic bottles the inner layers of all the bottles 
are made of new plastic and the outer layers are made with a 
combination of new and recycled plastic 
the bottles being used in the market test arent specially 
marked to note their recycled content the initial shipments are 
aimed at finding out whether the special bottles hold up to regular 
wear and tear during shipping stewart said 
the project wont necessarily provide a savings or marketing 
advantage according to tom rattray pampgs associate director for 
corporate packing development 
deborah anderson the companys director of environmental 
coordination said procter amp gamble hopes to develop a way to use 
highdensity polyethylene the soft flexible plastic used for 
milk juice detergent and other bottles from any source 
including its own detergent bottles 
procter amp gamble had worldwide sales of 193 billion during 
fiscal 198788 its businesses include laundry and cleaning

mcdonnell douglas corp said friday that 
without 179 million gained because of an accounting change the 
company would have recorded a 10 million loss in firstquarter net 
earnings 
reduction of the companys deferred tax liability through the 
adoption of a new accounting standard had the effect of adding the 
179 million or 468 a share after taxes the st louisbased 
company said 
excluding that benefit the company reported a loss in net 
earnings for the quarter of 10 million or 25 cents a share on 
revenue of 34 billion compared with net earnings of 51 million 
or 133 a share on revenue of 331 billion for the same period 
last year 
earnings were depressed by an operating loss of 66 million in 
the companys transport aircraft segment and a special provision 
for interest on taxes related to a dispute with the internal 
revenue service over the timing of tax obligations the company 
said 
in addition the company said there was a 15 percent reduction 
in operating earnings from combat aircraft 
contributing to the operating loss in transport aircraft was a 
major reorganization of the douglas aircraft co initiated in the 
first quarter to provide longterm improvements in operations the 
transition caused some disruption and ineffeciences the company 
said 
operating earnings in the combat aircraft segment declined as a 
result of decreased performance in the manufacturing process the 
company said 
total interest expense in the aerospace and information systems 
segments increased from 41 million in the first quarter of last 
year to 99 million this year 
the company said that while that was due partly to higher 
interest rates and increased corporate borrowings a large portion 
of it related to a special provision for resolving tax issues 
the corporation and the irs have disagreed over the completion 
dates of longterm contracts settlement with the irs may result in 
interest and previously deferred taxes being paid to the irs the 
company said

corporate researchers are discovering that 
proper support for the buttocks can improve the bottom line 
at the research complex of furniture maker herman miller inc 
engineers and technicians say comfy and supportive seats are 
crucial in a country where 70 percent to 80 percent of workers have 
sedentary jobs many hunched over computers for long periods 
studies have shown that productivity increases when 
ergonomic seating is introduced said neil goldberg a company 
researcher if people are comfortable and have the support they 
need they will tend to sit longer and work longer 
herman miller the worlds secondlargest office furniture maker 
behind steelcase inc of grand rapids this week introduced two new 
chair designs and invited reporters for a lesson in ergonomics 
the science of adapting working conditions to suit workers 
the company sells comfort with statistics it says absence from 
work due to back pain has increased 40 percent since 1970 while a 
total of about 5 billion is paid out annually to employees by 
insurance companies for back and neck pain claims 
when sitting about 75 percent of a persons total body weight 
is supported on four square inches of the buttocks sitting on a 
hard flat surface can put pressure of 85 pounds to 100 pounds per 
square inch on the buttocks which can restrict blood flow herman 
miller says 
the company said about 38 percent of workers who sit in front of 
computers most of the day experience back pain 
independent research confirms much of herman millers sales 
pitch 
you cant just buy an office chair as an afterthought said 
marvin dainoff a psychology professor at miami universitys center 
for ergonomic research in oxford ohio who has studied work 
environments 
if you focus on the employees daily work and get a chair that 
fits you will see a difference in productivity he said 
in studies he performed in 198182 dainoff had 12 temporary 
clerical workers conduct dataentry work at a typical work 
station with a standard desk governmentissue secretarial chair 
and a computer terminal with attached keyboard under a bank of 
fluorescent lights 
the workers would rotate between that environment and an 
optimal one with good lighting an ergonomic chair and work 
station adjustable keyboard and antiglare monitor 
measuring key stroke and error rates dainoff found an average 
247 percent increase in productivity with the workers at the 
optimal work station in a second study the only variable was the 
office furniture and dainoff found a 17 percent productivity 
increase 
goldberg said comfort selfadjusting support and the matching 
of the seat to the workers task are the most important factors in 
selecting an office chair the way to minimize the stress of a 
static posture is to have a chair that allows the worker to move 
tilt pivot recline and stretch 
a good chair becomes invisible you forget youre sitting 
goldberg said if youre uncomfortable sitting is all you think 
about 
but a good seat doesnt come cheap herman millers stressfree 
productionenhancing midpriced office chairs list for between 
450 and 800

the securities and exchange commission asked an 
appeals court friday to consider a legal maneuver that could break 
the logjam blocking final approval of the massive drexel burnham 
lambert inc settlement 
the sec and drexel asked the appeals court to clarify or 
reconsider its earlier ruling which blocks us district judge 
milton pollack from considering a plan to settle the biggest 
securities fraud case in history 
the sec and drexel are now asking the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals whether another district court judge could consider the 
tentative settlement 
pollack is barred from approving the drexelsec settlement or 
conducting any further proceedings in the case pending a bid to 
disqualify him for an alleged conflict of interest 
in addition to delaying settlement of the secs civil action 
against drexel the 2nd circuit ruling also holds up drexels plea 
agreement with federal prosecutors requiring the investment 
banking giant to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay 650 
million in fines and penalties 
on wednesday the 2nd circuit unanimously refused to modify its 
earlier stay against any action by pollack but the appeals court 
did not address the secs alternative proposal to let another judge 
handle the matter 
in washington sec solicitor paul gonson said the commission was 
asking the 2nd circuit to clear up any ambiguity or to 
reconsider that part of the initial request not mentioned in its 
wednesday ruling 
the sec joined by drexel and cary j maultasch a drexel 
employee named in the sec action asked the appeals court whether 
it would consider allowing the judge sitting in part i the section 
handling miscellaneous and emergency actions to handle the 
settlement 
wednesdays ruling made no reference at all to the part i 
judge said gonson the reasoning in that order didnt appear 
to undercut the authority of the part i judge 
the challenge to pollack first came from drexel which has since 
withdrawn its objection drexel lawyers maintained pollack should 
be disqualified because his wife stood to make millions from a 
leveraged buyout that drexel had helped to finance 
but the matter is now being pressed by former drexel junk bond 
chief michael milken and his brother lowell who are not part of 
either settlement the us supreme court has not yet decided 
whether to consider the milkens appeal but the process could delay 
final approval of the settlement for months 
the milkens were named earlier this month in a massive federal 
racketeering indictment seeking more than 18 billion in 
forfeitures they have pleaded innocent 
last week drexel and the sec asked the 2nd circuit to modify the 
stay but the appeals court said allowing pollack to consider and 
possibly to approve this settlement would be to allow a change in 
the status quo as it concerns the interests of michael and lowell 
milken before the supreme court has disposed of the case 
in seeking clarification of that order gonson noted that the 
only issue before the supreme court in the milkens appeal is 
whether judge pollack can remain on the case and turning the 
case over to another judge would bypass the rule barring the 2nd 
circuit from altering a stay until the high court has decided

whittle communications lp sent out the last of 
its experimental television news shows for teens on friday but 
wont decide until midsummer if the commerciallysponsored project 
passed or failed its test 
the channel one news program a daily 12minute newscast with 
two minutes of product advertising per show has been beamed by 
satellite over the past seven weeks to six middle and high schools 
the program has proven popular with many of the teachers 
principals and students in the six test schools but it has drawn 
criticism from some national education groups who object to 
permitting paid pitches for shampoo candy bars sneakers and jeans 
in the classroom 
we thought a lot of the program said stan jasinskas 
principal at eisenhower middle school in kansas city kan one of 
the test schools we think it probably ought to be continued 
nationally 
ed winter the whittle partner in charge of the channel one 
project said it may take two months or more to evaluate results of 
the test and if it is feasible to expand the program nationally he 
expects a decision by midsummer 
the projects initial goal was to make the program and the 
equipment available to as many as 10000 schools in the fall of 
1990 if it does that channel one would be knoxville tennbased 
whittle communications largest single business 
the speciality magazine and sponsored poster publisher had 
revenue of about 150 million last year and estimates channel one 
could produce 100 million in revenue on its own 
the channel one test began on march 6 at eisenhower middle 
school and at high schools in knoxville tenn cincinnati 
billerica mass detroit and cerritos calif 
in addition to 25 daily shows with advertising whittle provided 
fourpage course guides for teachers a commercialfree live 
broadcast of a space shuttle launch and several public broadcasting 
system programs 
in addition to criticism over subjecting students to product 
ads some educators have faulted the way channel one is presented 
scott thomson executive director of the national association of 
secondary school principals said research has indicated the best 
way to use television as a teaching aid is to use it selectively as 
part of a lesson 
but he said channel one fails to do that because it is beamed 
schoolwide at a regular time of the day without regard to whether 
the program fits in with whatever class may follow 
thomson said he is not surprised that the administrators at the 
test schools speak highly of the program you cant expect them 
to say ive made a poor professional judgment he said 
the test schools get to keep the equipment whittle installed no 
matter what happens with the project schools who sign up if it 
goes national would keep the equipment only as long as they showed 
the program regularly 
whittle isnt the only company providing television programming 
for schools and educators expect that competing daily services 
will emerge 
turner broadcasting system incs cable news network is already 
involved in a venture with the national school boards association 
that is making a weekly news wrapup show available to schools 
under the service called news access about 200 schools are 
paying fees ranging from 200 to 600 a year for the rights to 
replay in class all or parts of cnns week in review program that 
airs on sundays 
as part of that project the schools get a 40page classroom 
guide via computer with tips on how the show can be used to 
complement lessons in science social studies mathematics 
language or the arts 
one of the differences between the services however is that 
whittle is providing about 50000 in television sets video 
recorders and satellite dishes to each of the participating schools 
while the schools subscribing to news access must provide their own 
equipment 
another is that whittle requires that schools air its daily news 
program to the entire student body each school day while teachers 
using the weekly news access program are free to use segments in 
class and are not bound to show any of it to their students

a record number of emotioncharged shareholder resolutions are 
bombarding us companies in the 1989 annual meeting season on 
topics ranging from south africa to northern ireland to bans on 
animal cruelty and nuclear weapons 
the surge reflects a growing militancy among shareholders 
especially large institutions such as pension funds which now see 
annual meetings as an important forum to confront executives about 
their ethics and priorities 
i think the reason this is growing is because institutional 
investors in particular have discovered they have responsibilities 
for their stakeholders pensioners or others beyond just getting 
as much of a financial return as they can said diane bratcher 
director of communications for the interfaith center on corporate 
responsibility a new yorkbased activist church concern 
some also attribute the shareholder resolution movement to a 
matured population of baby boomers raised during the antiwar 
movement of the 1960s 
many of these people are now stockholders and stock mutual fund 
investors looking to put their money to work in ways that conform 
to their own political and ethical beliefs 
thats led to an explosion in professional investment funds that 
use social concerns as a basis for what securities to buy these 
funds have grown from 40 billion in assets a few years ago to 
about 400 billion now securities industry figures show 
there are a lot of 60s people who are still around and have 
the money to invest said rosalyn will a researcher at the 
council for economic priorities a new york group that follows the 
shareholder resolution movement many have retained those values 
many have kids who have those values too 
others say many corporate executives themselves have begun to 
encourage shareholder resolutions as part of a strategy to show 
they are more sensitive and responsive to the people who own their 
companies 
an interesting trend weve seen this year more and more is 
that companies are realizing how to open a dialogue with 
institutional investors said robert amen a corporate consultant 
in greenwich conn who attends and evaluates dozens of annual 
meetings 
three leading management consulting firms ernst amp whinney 
touche ross amp co and deloitte haskins amp sells have started 
publishing special booklets for executives on how to answer 
shareholder queries at annual meetings especially in an era of 
economic uncertainty and growing questions about business ethics 
company directors and officials prepared for the 1989 annual 
stockholders meetings will be responding to investors who are 
concerned about not only the potential impact of results on 
individual share prices but also the way companies are being run 
deloitte says in its booklet 
the investor responsibility research center a washingtonbased 
group that monitors corporate behavior says a record 176 
shareholder resolutions on sensitive issues will be voted on during 
this annual meeting season which generally runs from midapril 
through early june 
that compares with 156 introduced in 1988 108 in 1980 and 40 in 
1973 
shareholder activists say the catalyst clearly has been the 
effort aimed at compelling us corporations to vacate south africa 
because of its whiteminority governments systematic suppression 
of the black majority 
although many south africa divestment resolutions have been 
routinely defeated at annual meetings their sponsors say mere 
discussion of the issue has raised management awareness and has 
played a role in the departure of more than 140 us companies from 
that country since 1984 
moreover sponsors of south african resolutions have been 
gaining an increasing number of yesvotes at annual meetings 
forcing companies to reintroduce the resolutions the following 
year under securities and exchange commission rules on publicly 
traded companies shareholder resolutions receiving at least 3 
percent approval the first year they are introduced must be on the 
next annual meetings agenda 
ms bracher whose group has been a leading proponent of south 
african divestment said the success of the movement has inspired 
other socially active investor groups to start their own campaigns 
she said the fastest growing efforts target us divestment in 
britishruled northern ireland and fair employment practices by 
us multinationals operating in thirdworld countries 
aerospace giant lockheed corp for example has been targeted 
by the pension fund managers of new york public employees over the 
fairhiring practices of the companys subcontractors in northern 
ireland 
figgie international a richmond vabased concern that makes 
professional sports equipment has been targeted by churchactivist 
groups over allegations of abysmal working conditions at its 
baseball factory in haiti 
animal rights long an issue raised by picketers at annual 
meetings has become an agenda item as well this year 
shareholders in at least 10 us companies will be voting on 
resolutions proposed by animal rights activists 
people for the ethical treatment of animals a washington lobby 
group has introduced shareholder resolutions on laboratory testing 
at the annual meetings of american home products corp 
bristolmyers co colgatepalmolive inc and the gillete co 
among others 
the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
asked that mcdonalds corp investigate the effect on animals of 
factory farming the mass production of chickens cows and pigs 
slaughtered for food the aspca withdrew the resolution after 
mcdonalds agreed to conduct a study 
elsewhere the federation of american scientists has introduced 
shareholder resolutions at bankamerica citicorp and manufacturers 
hanover three of latin americas biggest creditors requesting 
them to persuade debtors brazil and argentina not to develop 
nuclear weapons 
other shareholder issues on the agenda this season include human 
rights in chile nuclear reactor safety antibioticfed poultry 
third world debt and contributions to political action committees 
william morley chief counsel for the secs division of 
corporate finance said hes noticed a growing sophistication by 
shareholder activists who want to get resolutions on meeting 
agendas 
they know for example what eligibility rules are from state to 
state when to submit proposals to companies and how to seek sec 
assistance if they think a company has unfairly blocked a proposal 
from consideration 
a lot of social issue people have been writing them for 
years morley said but each time you go through a season you 
get new groups involved and they have a better idea of how you 
jump through the hoops

citizens amp southern corp president hugh chapman 
who has been offered a high level position as part of ncnb incs 
unsolicited bid to acquire the bank was named friday as chief 
operating officer of camps 
however a camps spokesman said the move had no connection to 
ncnbs offer 
this has been in the works a long time we just announced it 
at this time said camps spokesman scott scredon 
chapman will retain his position of president in the newly 
created job and will head the atlantabased banks policy 
committee a group of senior managers who guide the company 
hugh will be responsible for the daytoday operation of camps 
when i am not available said camps chairman bennett a brown 
all who know hugh share my respect for his judgment and my 
confidence in his leadership abilities 
camps has been targeted by charlotte ncbased ncnb in a 24 
billion takeover bid ncnbs stock transfer offer has been rejected 
by the camps board which said it was inadequate and would face stiff 
regulatory hurdles 
ncnb chairman hugh l mccoll jr in a letter to brown april 12 
addressed those objections and outlined what he considered the 
benefits of the proposal mccoll offered brown the chairmanship of 
the combined company and said chapman would have a key role 
hugh chapman will become one of the most senior executives and 
an important member of the combined management team mccoll wrote 
camps officials have refused to meet with ncnb to discuss the bid 
ncnb which has maintained its offer remains on the table is 
scheduled to hold its annual meeting wednesday in charlotte 
scredon said chapmans promotion was prompted by browns recent 
election as president of the association of reserve city bankers 
an industry organization that position will require brown to make 
frequent trips to washington he said 
we dont want the machine to get bogged down when he is gone 
we dont want things to grind to a halt scredon said

a new round of bargain fares between some of the 
few cities still served by strikecrippled eastern airlines has 
drawn a tremendous response the company said friday 
but some miami area travel agents didnt share the carriers 
enthusiasm 
the fares announced wednesday range from 29 to 99 for oneway 
flights from miami to new york atlanta puerto rico haiti and the 
bahamas a flight from miami to new york for example would cost 
79 one way and 158 round trip 
eastern said thursday it would restore other prestrike routes 
may 1 and offer cheap oneway fares along with them miamiorlando 
for 29 atlantanew york and atlantawashington for 59 and 
atlantasan juan puerto rico for 119 
the response to these new fares has been tremendous george 
brennan easterns vice president for marketing said friday he 
said thursdays ticket sales of 23000 tripled those sold on the 
previous high booking day since the strike began march 4 
but joyce curtis who said the up up and away travel agency she 
manages in fort lauderdale fla once handled nearly 800000 a 
year in eastern ticket sales said the bargain rates had attracted 
only two customers by friday afternoon 
and eastern was once our preferred carrier she said 
some travel agents who had customers stuck with worthless 
tickets after pilots and flight attendants joined striking 
machinists on march 4 to virtually shut down the miamibased 
airline remain so disgruntled that they wont sell eastern tickets 
at any price 
were not booking eastern right now said jan lobota

the venerable new york stock exchange long a 
bastion of resistance to the global push toward 24hour securities 
trading said friday it is studying ways of developing a system of 
offhours transactions 
the admission by the 198yearold big board was viewed as a 
reaction to moves by competing stock exchanges to implement fully 
computerized roundtheclock trading systems that could siphon away 
business from wall street 
under computerized trading shares of stock can be traded 
electronically when the exchange floor is shut down via programs 
that automatically match up buyers and sellers for various 
securities 
nyse spokesman richard torrenzano said the exchange plans to 
discuss the issue with customers traders institutional investors 
listed companies and securities firms 
what were saying is in the next six to 24 months well be 
looking at a number of different things torrenzano said 
were not sure there is enough demand to make the nyse go to 
24hour trading he said we have to go out and talk to all the 
various parties in the market based on those needs and demands 
the new york stock exchange will be very responsive and committed 
the tiny cincinnati stock exchange last month announced plans to 
implement computerized 24hour trading in the next 19 months more 
perilous for the nyse chicagos two futures markets announced they 
are developing afterhours trading systems 
overseas the toronto stock exchange the tokyo stock exchange 
and other markets have introduced at least partially automated 
execution systems and have been open to the concept of harnessing 
technology to give investors the option of buying or selling at any 
time 
im afraid its possible that us equities markets could move 
to another marketplace domestically or even to another marketplace 
offshore in the event of a better system said junius w peake 
chairman of peakeryerson consulting group inc an international 
capital markets firm its still the better mousetrap theory 
it doesnt matter if youre in tokyo or bermuda or rio de 
janeiro i dont care where the location of the transaction occurs 
as long as i know its a good trade 
the new york stock exchange where an average of 160 million 
shares of the listed 1680 stocks change hands daily has resisted 
automation in part wall street officials say because of pressure 
from floor brokers and firms not to tamper with the system 
in todays nyse an electronic delivery system routes orders to 
the exchange floor where they are handled by professional market 
makers called specialists who shout out buy and sell orders in the 
manner of an auction 
these middlemen would be dinosaurs in a fully automated 
enviroment and unnecessary in offhours trading when a computer 
system would match up buyers and sellers of a desired stock at any 
time of day or night 
one criticism of 24hour electronic trading is that without 
specialists to take the other side of the trade orders will hang 
in limbo until an opposing order arrives 
under the globex tradematching system developed by the chicago 
mercantile exchange and the british firm reuters holdings plc the 
number of orders best bids and offers and quantity of bids and 
offers will be listed immediately on a computer screen 
another offhours trading system known as aurora planned by 
the chicago board of trade will simulate the chaotic commodities 
trading pits on a computer screen 
new york stock exchange chairman john phelan received a 
presentation by the developers of the chicago merc system last week 
but was absolutely noncommittal about whether the exchange 
would adopt new technology a participant said 
the nyse maintains that it does not feel threatened by the 
infusion of automatic trading 
torrenzano said the nyse studied offhours trading in 1984 and 
1985 and found little demand the nyse the worlds secondlargest 
exchange behind tokyo in september 1985 expanded trading time by 
a half hour daily and is now open from 930 am to 4 pm 
i think were living in a much more competitive environment 
but i dont think thats causing us to take a closer look he 
said to take a leadership position in the equities marketplace 
today you must be looking at what everyones doing all the time

financial markets staged a powerful comeback 
friday from a brief scare that an interest rate increase in west 
germany would trigger a spiral of rising rates around the world 
stock prices leaped in late trading and bonds rose after 
thursdays modest selloff which came after west germany announced 
it would raise key interest rates to stave off inflation 
the fear thursday was that west germanys action could prompt 
other nations to raise their own rates in order to keep global 
money from flowing out of their currencies 
that concern eased friday as investors concluded that the 
federal reserve would not necessarily push us interest rates 
higher 
i think what the markets are telling us is that this was a 
temporary scare and the underlying tone of the markets is 
constructive said michael metz a managing director and 
investment strategist at oppenheimer amp co 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 3208 to 240946 
after having fallen 953 points on thursday 
the rise accelerated by program trading brought the average to 
its highest point since the october 1987 crash 
in the credit market the yield on the treasurys benchmark 
30year bond dipped back below 9 percent which it had exceeded 
thursday 
west germany is historically fearful of inflation and its moves 
to dampen price increases by tightening the screws on its own 
economy have often sent ripples through the world economy 
indeed the netherlands austria and denmark followed the 
germans thursday in raising rates keeping their nations 
securities attractive to investors 
but the federal reserve has apparently concluded that it does 
not need to raise us rates even if the failure to do so causes 
money to flow abroad and the dollar to fall metz said 
the fed places more importance on the state of the us economy 
than on the dollars level and has apparently concluded that the 
level of us inflation does not justify higher rates he said 
some investment analysts say the west germans are right to be 
vigilant and that the united states could be in for a crisis if it 
does not squelch inflation now 
were riding along on a wave of liquidityinspired euphoria 
said samuel thorne jr managing director for fixedincome 
portfolio management at scudder stevens amp clark inc in boston 
were going to get a squall he said 
although west germanys inflation rate remains low by world 
standards 3 percent yearoveryear at the consumer level in the 
latest tally the nations factory usage rate is at a 16year high 
and economic growth is running above normal 
those factors prompted thursdays announcement of increases in 
the german central bank lending rates said nicholas sargen an 
international economist at salomon brothers inc in new york 
still the increases surprised the financial markets because 
karl otto poehl president of the west german central bank had 
said recently that interest rates were high enough to discourage 
inflation

the market suffered a temporary setback thursday when the west 
german central bank announced unexpected increases in its official 
interest rates 
that raised fears of downward pressure on the dollar and of 
possible further credittightening in this country 
by friday however analysts said investors seemed to be taking 
the view that the federal reserve would wait a while longer to 
gauge the effects of the restrictive moves it has already made over 
the past year or so 
thus observers noted the possibility remained open in many 
minds that interest rates are close to or at a peak

a dramatic move to raise interest rates in west 
germany hasnt dashed hopes on wall street for a downturn in rates 
in the months ahead 
the news thursday of halfpoint increases in the west german 
central banks official interest rates sent a jolt through the 
american stock and bond markets as well as driving the dollar 
downward in foreign exchange 
but stock prices stabilized soon afterward and began a speedy 
recovery as analysts increasingly came to the view that a new 
international round of credittightening wasnt likely 
statistical measures of business activity and inflation in west 
germany have been on the rise of late a development that prompted 
new restraints in a very inflationconscious nation 
in the united states however there have been some recent signs 
of slowing in the pace of the economy apparently prompted by the 
credittightening steps the federal reserve has taken over the past 
year 
most observers believe the fed wants to wait at least another 
month or two to gauge the impact of what it has already done before 
deciding on any further measures 
we believe that the bond market is setting up for a major 
buying opportunity by midyear declares arnold moskowitz 
economist at dean witter reynolds inc 
he predicts that a rally in bond prices will send interest rates 
on treasury bonds now fluctuating around 9 percent to 75 percent 
by yearend 
support for this kind of view can be found in the consumer 
marketplace says richard sichel an analyst at first pennsylvania 
bank 
sears will now sell consumer products for low prices every day 
and not just on special occasions sichel points out ford gm 
and chrysler will pay you cash to purchase their cars and are 
hawking low or nointerestrate financing to help you decide 
whether all of this is necessary is conjecture however it 
does send a message that the economy is not booming inflation 
should subside and interest rates may be near a peak 
that sort of talk helped the stock market extend a monthlong 
rally this past week to new highs since before the crash of 1987 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 7240 points to 
240946 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 401 to 17290 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
608 to 42376 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 677 at 34259 
volume on the big board averaged 17840 million shares a day up 
from 16889 million the week before 
if interest rates do turn downward in the months ahead analysts 
caution they may not represent an unalloyed benefit for the stock 
market 
one risk is that lower rates would encourage international 
investors to seek out better returns on their money in other 
countries 
that in turn could mean downward pressure on the dollar 
crimping the results foreign investors can achieve in us stocks 
in addition there is the threat that lower rates would be 
accompanied by a substantial slowing of the economy and a dropoff 
in corporate profits 
in our view the equity markets at some point this year will 
conclude that the economy must slow down significantly if inflation 
is to lessen said suresh bhirud chief investment strategist at

burger king corp said friday it is looking for 
a new agency to handle its national advertising after just 18 
months with nw ayer inc the firm that created the slogan we 
do it like youd do it 
the miamibased fastfood restaurant operator said it had 
already selected three agencies to compete for the assignment and 
expected to decide by summer 
the decision was not entirely unexpected because the nations 
second largest fastfood chain has undergone extensive managerial 
changes since its parent pillsbury co was acquired earlier this 
year by grand metropolitan plc of great britain 
burger kings sales have been sluggish and it has been unable to 
increase its share of the fastfood market now estimated at about 
17 percent 
one of the three finalists is the chicago office of j walter 
thompson whose new york office was burger kings agency for 11 
years until it was dumped in favor of ayer in september 1987 
the other two finalists burger king said are darcy masius 
benton amp bowles new york and saatchi amp saatchi advertising new 
york 
darcy formerly worked for the hardees food systems fastfood 
chain and its los angeles office currently is the agency for 
dennys restaurants 
saatchi created the wheres the beef advertising campaign 
for wendys international inc in the mid1980s 
barry gibbons burger kings chief executive said he was 
looking for a national agency with global capabilities solid 
industry experience bold creative and media expertise and sound 
strategic thinking and then have the determination to stick with 
that agency 
he said the company had informally reviewed potential agencies 
since january the three finalists are expected to present 
proposals to burger king in three to four weeks after which a 
decision will be announced 
gary langstaff burger kings new marketing chief said the 
search for a new national agency does not apply to our regional 
agency structure which apparently means ayer will continue 
producing local advertising 
joyce meyers a burger king spokeswoman said burger kings 
marketing budget for 1989 is about 215 million including spending 
on national and local advertising and promotions she said no 
decision has been made on how much of that figure will be spent on 
national advertising alone this year 
officials at the new yorkbased ayer said they handled about 
150 million in billings for burger king last year split fairly 
evenly between national and local advertising 
we are disappointed surprised but not unprepared louis t 
hagopian ayers chairman and chief executive said in a memo 
distributed to employees 
he noted that in the time ayer held the account pillsbury had 
four different chief executives while burger king had four chief 
executives and four heads of marketing 
it is just a shame the agency has to take the rap for the 
errors and inconsistencies of so many others who have come and gone 
and come and gone he wrote 
hagopian said that while there may be some layoffs the agency 
would do so as considerately as is humanly possible about 100 
ayer people work on the account 
he said the account represents about 10 percent of the agencys 
15 billion in billings and that the agencys finances were strong 
this is a blow but it isnt even touching the foundations 
he said 
ayer launched the we do it like youd do it campaign in 
february 1988 the company has relied less heavily on the theme in 
recent months however focusing on individual product promotion 
instead 
burger kings myers said the decision to select a new national 
agency was not as much a reflection on ayerss work as a desire by 
the companys new management to start with clean sheet and signal 
this is a new burger king

when ford motor co introduces its new 
light truck in the 1991 model year a portion of the vehicles will 
be sold to a subsidiary of japans mazda motor corp ford 
officials announced friday 
i think its a great opportunity for an american manufacturer 
to sell a product to the japanese said harold a poling ford 
vice chairman and chief operating officer 
poling offered no specifics about the new vehicle in his address 
to a kentucky chamber of commerce audience there has been 
speculation that the truck will be smaller than fords current 
bronco ii 
some of the production will be sold to mazda and marketed 
under the mazda badge poling said the rest will appear next 
year as a new ford product and although we are not ready to 
describe our new vehicle i can tell you we believe it will be a 
real winner 
the agreement between ford and mazda north america inc appears 
to be similar to a current pact under which mazda makes the ford 
probe and the mazda mx6 mazda has done most of the design and 
engineering work on the cars 
the new truck probably will be engineered and designed mainly by 
ford which has owned 25 percent of the hiroshima japanbased 
mazda motor corp since 1972 
poling said after the speech that it had not yet been determined 
what percentage of the product would be sold to mazda 
he told the chamber of commerce audience that ford has 
researched alternativefuel vehicles as a means of responding to 
environmental concerns 
wed like to see cooperative industry and government 
evaluation programs for alternativefuel vehicles along with 
incentives to encourage consumer interest and increased 
availability of alternative fuels he said

an experimental news program for 
children was hailed as a success friday by students and the 
principal at one of six schools nationwide that tested the show 
we have been tremendously pleased with our participation in 
the program said stan jasinskas principal at eisenhower middle 
school we have seen many positive results 
eisenhower was one of the schools that watched channel one a 
12minute news program complete with commercials the 5 million 
program debuted in the six schools in march 
the show resembled a network news program but with young 
anchors flashy graphics and a teenage perspective on the news 
the commercials raised the ire of some childrens advocates who 
feared advertisers would take advantage of children 
but ottice hall a seventhgrade student at eisenhower said he 
enjoyed watching the programs at school 
i liked it because they had all these fun things to watch 
he said and i liked the commercials they had some new ones 
ottice said he would like to keep channel one 
its fun to watch tv at school i dont watch the news at 
home he said 
jasinskas said the program provided students with a valuable 
educational lesson 
channel one featured the environment in a fivepart series one 
week for instance and some students wrote to fastfood 
restaurants soft drink producers and city councilmen to express 
their concern about chemicals and recycling 
some kids got written responses from the mayor and from these 
corporations jasinskas said what happened goes beyond content 
knowledge the kids have picked up an appreciation for how the 
system works whether just writing that letter is enough to bring 
about a change i cant say but i know that the experience has 
brought about a change in the kids 
the experiment exposed the children to news they otherwise would 
not have seen the principal said 
with the lifestyles that kids have with school and homework 
and church and some with jobs they are not going to be regular 
consumers of the news he said channel one has brought to 
those kids consistent access not only to events but to issues 
if jasinskas was making decisions for only one school instead of 
a multibuilding district he said he would keep the program 
i might find that i would want to tailor it a bit more to our 
needs but overall i am very pleased it has been a tremendously 
valuable program he said

grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly friday on the 
chicago board of trade after some private meteorologists reduced 
the amount of rain in their forecasts for early next week in the 
midwest and great plains 
on other markets gold and silver futures retreated livestock 
and meat were higher and energy futures were mixed 
in chicago wheat settled 4 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 414 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 5 cents higher with may at 275 a bushel oats were 4 cents 
to 5 cents higher with may at 202 a bushel soybeans were 4 
cents to 12 cents higher with may at 760 a bushel 
the sharp gains in the soybean and corn markets reflected 
concerns about low soil moisture in iowa northwestern illinois and 
other areas of the corn belt still struggling to recover from last 
years drought 
theres just a lot of nervousness that were going to have a 
repeat of last year said james candor a meteorologist with 
accuweather inc a private forecasting firm in state college pa 
candor said accuweather revised its forecast friday toward the 
dry end of the scale predicting that a third of the midwestern 
croplands would receive about a halfinch of rain on sunday or 
monday on thursday accuweather had predicted coverage of 40 
percent to 50 percent 
weekend rain could hamper corn planting though and it would 
not necessarily be beneficial for corn seedlings which prefer 
warm dry conditions early in their growth cycle 
soybeans need more moisture to get started than corn does 
said walter spilka a grain market analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york when you see dry forecasts 
youre likely to see a better runup in the soybean market 
predictions for continued dry weather in the great plains 
bolstered wheat prices 
gold and silver futures prices fell slightly on new yorks 
commodity exchange in response to the dollars gains against other 
major currencies 
gold settled 70 cents to 120 lower with june at 38820 a troy 
ounce silver was 2 cents to 22 cents lower with may at 5765 a 
troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the chicago 
mercantile exchange in light cautious trading ahead of two 
agriculture department reports the quarterly cattleonfeed report 
and the monthly coldstorage report which were released after the 
close of trading 
in the cattleonfeed report the usda counted 968 million head 
of cattle on feedlots on april 1 in the 13 largest cattleproducing 
states the tally was 3 percent larger than last years 
firstquarter count and slightly above market expectations but 
probably not by enough to have much impact on mondays trading 
analysts said 
in the coldstorage report the usda found 1338 million pounds 
of frozen pork bellies on hand at the end of march the fifth 
consecutive month of record supplies the usda pegged total pork 
supplies at 3972 million pounds the largest monthly supply figure 
in the past 10 years 
the numbers were close to market estimates and were not expected 
to cause any sharp price movement on monday 
live cattle futures settled 20 cent lower to 45 cent higher 
with june at 7142 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 
50 cent higher with may at 7617 cents a pound hogs were 12 cent 
to 65 cent higher with june at 4560 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 30 cent lower to 40 cent higher with may at 3130 
cents a pound

because of transitory factors but the computer maker predicted 
a return to profitability in the current quarter and a strong 
second half of 1989

result of a transition to a new mainframe computer line and the 
resulting startup costs interruption in sales and inventory 
reduction costs

petroleum prices finished mixed friday capping 
a frantic week in which a north sea oil platform explosion sent 
crude oil to the highest level in more than three years 
the explosion resulted in a supply shutdown that stopped the 
shipment of more than 500000 barrels a day of brent crude or 
about 30 percent of total north sea brent oil production britain 
energy minister cecil parkinson said 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil finished 
4 cents higher at 2132 a barrel contracts for delivery after 
june rose as much as 41 cents 
the 204 surge in the may contract on thursday set a record for 
the highest oneday rise since the exchange started trading crude 
oil futures in march 1983 said john santana nyme statistical 
analyst the contract closed at 2465 the highest level since 
jan 15 1986 when it reached 2515 
in the four days before the contract expired on thursday the 
contract rose more than 3 or about 16 percent 
among refined products traded on the exchange friday unleaded 
gasoline for may delivery fell 041 cent to 7416 cents a gallon 
while the june contract was down 018 cent to 7118 cents other 
contract months finished higher 
may heating oil meanwhile rose 134 cent to 5363 cents a 
gallon with other contract months also registering gains 
there was no word late friday on when the brent pipeline system 
would return to normal officials of shell uk the unit of the 
royal dutchshell group that operates the platform and the pipeline 
system indicated there might be a partial resumption of about 
100000 barrels a day starting monday 
british officials had indicated earlier in the week that the 
closure could last up to four weeks 
analysts said the timing of the north sea accident on tuesday 
was the biggest reason for rising prices coming less than four 
weeks after the alaskan oil tanker spill that temporarily cut the 
flow of oil to refineries and adding to concerns about tight 
supplies of gasoline for the summer 
were heading into the driving season only a month from 
memorial day said andrew lebow senior broker with edamp f man 
international futures inc this is when refiners want to start 
increasing production of gasoline they want to make sure they have 
enough crude to run their refineries at full capacity 
light north sea brent crude is in high demand because it is more 
easily refined into gasoline analysts said there is plenty of 
crude in storage to compensate for the shortfall if the north sea 
shutdown is not prolonged 
the stoppage in the north sea could be serious and for a long 
time but there is enough opec and nonopec crude to make up the 
difference in the shortterm said james steel energy analyst 
with refco inc 
steel said the north sea accident is not likely to boost 
consumer prices barring a prolonged shutdown 
not because of this but i think gasoline prices will go up 
for other reasons steel said 
those include the change to higher octane gasoline required by 
the environmental protection agency and the reduction in refinery 
capacity the same amount of crude oil makes a smaller amount of 
gasoline also demand for gasoline has risen dramatically over the 
last year while the refinery capacity has declined as many 
antiquated refineries closed down 
us retail gasoline prices have risen more than 10 cents a 
gallon since the alaskan spill based on a combination of factors 
including expectations of possible short supplies

media general inc said friday its 
firstquarter profit edged up 26 percent mainly because of a 
onetime gain resulting from the sale of a newsprint mill 
net income rose to 119 million or 46 cents per share in the 
three months ended march 31 compared with 115 million or 40 
cents per share in the same period in 1988 
the latest results include an aftertax gain of 57 million or 
22 cents per share which media general said resulted from the 
federal income tax accounting treatment of the sale of its pomona 
calif newsprint mill 
firstquarter revenues fell 199 percent to 1493 million from 
186 million last year 
james s evans president and chief executive officer of media 
general said he expected financial results for the next two years 
wont likely reach the highs set in 1987 
in the latest quarter newspaper profits fell 316 percent due 
to a continuing slide in national and retail advertising and 
ongoing competitive pressure in the tampast petersburg fla 
market where media generals tampa tribune is competing with the 
st petersburg times 
newsprint profits fell nearly 41 percent because of heavy price 
discounting and the loss of income from the pomona mill 
but broadcast and cable profits nearly doubled from a year ago 
the company said aided by growth at its fairfax va cable 
operation and the absence of the companys broadcast services unit 
that was sold late last year

chrysler corp on friday announced separate 
recalls of some 198788 jeep wrangler and 1989 dodge raider 
sportutility vehicles 
chrysler said in a statement that it would replace windshield 
wiper linkage components and install a reinforcement to the 
windshield frame on about 80000 jeep wranglers the repairs were 
needed to prevent potential cracking of the windshield frame at the 
wiper pivot mountings which in turn could cause dislocation of the 
wiper linkage the statement said 
chrysler also said it would install a heat adaptor plate below 
the throttle body on about 4600 dodge raiders equipped with 
3liter sixcylinder engines the repairs would prevent ice 
formation on the throttle body blade in temperatures below 10 
degrees a condition that could prevent the throttle from returning 
to the idle position when the accelerator pedal is released the 
statement said 
owners were being asked to return the vehicles to dealers for 
free repairs chrysler said the automaker said it was not aware of 
accidents or injuries resulting from either problem

interior secretary manuel lujan toured an 
oily alaska beach thursday but said it was too early to draw 
conclusions but a congressman with him said it was clear exxon and 
the coast guard both were covering their rear ends 
the visitors from washington dc accompanied by us rep don 
young ralaska traveled to naked island where workers turned 
firehoses on oilcovered rocks to wash the sludge back into prince 
william sound where it was sucked up by a waiting skimmer 
it looks like it will be a big job to clean it up lujan 
told reporters who caught up with him after he eluded the news 
media in valdez 
i was expecting something like this id read about it and 
seen it on tv and this doesnt surprise me its too early for me 
to say what ill tell the president lujan said 
us rep curt weldon rpa a member of the merchant marine amp 
fisheries committee said he had no trouble drawing conclusions 
after separate briefings in valdez by the coast guard and exxon 
officials 
there were a lot of people covering their rear ends weldon 
said we got briefings by the coast guard and exxon they were 
completely diametrically opposite 
lujan and his entourage divided their day between valdez and 
naked island where the exxon valdez was towed for repairs after 
running aground march 24 rupturing its tanks and spilling 101 
million gallons of oil into prince william sound 
on friday he will visit the rich fishing ports of homer and 
kodiak both threatened by runaway oil slicks 
the us fish amp wildlife service already has tallied more than 
2000 dead birds and several hundred dead sea otters biologists 
say the death toll certainly is many times higher but the 
remoteness and inaccessibility of prince william sound make an 
accurate count impossible 
a giant soviet oil skimmer went to work thursday along the kenai 
peninsula raising the hopes of coast guard officials who had no 
skimmers capable of gathering floating oil on the high seas 
coast guard lt gary stock in anchorage said the 425foot 
skimmer vaidogubsky spent most of the day getting in place and 
testing its booms at the mouth of resurrection bay where streamers 
of oil that escaped into the gulf of alaska were being scattered by 
strong wind and currents 
from there the skimmer was expected to move along the hardhit 
southern edge of the kenai peninsula including the kenai fjords 
national park state officials said oil up to six inches deep has 
been reported on beaches around gore point about 90 miles 
southwest of seward 
a poll released thursday showed a 21 percentage point drop in 
the number of people who believe bush is doing a good job in 
handling environmental matters and the administrations response 
to the spill was lambasted at a senate subcommittee hearing this 
week 
transportation secretary samuel skinner came to alaska on bushs 
behalf a week after the spill and said he was generally satisfied 
with exxons response but skinner took a much tougher stance when 
he testified before the senate this week 
describing the oil industrys contingency spill response plan 
skinner said on the scale of one to 10 it was a zero 
the big soviet skimmer ship was called in because the small 
boats available in alaska can handle seas only to about 5 feet 
seas in the gulf of alaska recently have run as high as 12 feet 
bigger skimmers werent built because cleanup contingency 
planners didnt expect oil to get outside prince william sound 
which is largely protected from rough waves by a series of islands 
the vaidogubsky is the worlds largest oilskimming vessel it 
is owned by the far eastern sea oil and gas deepdrilling 
organization a governmentowned enterprise the ship can pick up 
800 cubic meters of sludge per hour with booms and two pumps 
the soviet ship was working in conjunction with the us coast 
guard but state officials relinquished command to exxon of a fleet 
of more than 300 other vessels engaged in the cleanup they said 
the move was to improve coordination 
jim hayden of the state department of environmental conservation 
said monitors will be placed on larger vessels to make sure exxons 
claims of oil recovered arent exaggerated and the number of dead 
animals isnt undercounted 
state environmental conservation commissioner dennis kelso said 
exxon claims to have recovered 13 percent of the 101 million 
gallons spilled but he said the figure probably includes seawater 
sucked up with the oil 
the oil has gotten progressively more difficult to clean up as 
it congeals from the effects on wind and water two coast guard 
skimmers were knocked out of action when the sludge fouled their 
pumps 
exxon says the recovered oil will be mixed with fresh north 
slope crude and taken to west coast refineries to be turned into 
heating oil and asphalt

pacific telesis group in a move that could 
set off a major legal squabble said thursday it had agreed in 
principle to acquire an option to buy an interest in the chicago 
cable television properties owned by group w 
the move if approved would mark the first time one of the baby 
bell telephone companies has entered the cable television field 
pacific telesis said an affiliate of prime cable of austin 
texas has an agreement in principle which it expects to be 
finalized next month to buy group ws chicago cable television 
assets for 198 million 
prime also has agreed in principle to sell a 68 percent interest 
in the properties to a financial partner which similarly has 
agreed to sell its interest to pacific telesis group if the phone 
company receives regulatory and legal approval 
james mooney president of the national cable television 
association in washington dc said his group would fight the 
pacific telesis proposal he said it appeared to violate the 1984 
federal consent decree under which american telephone amp telegraph 
co spun off its local telephone operations such as pacific 
telesis into seven regional holding companies informally called 
baby bells 
we support the consent decree which is premised on 
justifiable fears of telephone companies using their huge monopoly 
phone business to crosssubsidize and otherwise impede competition 
and therefore intend to oppose the granting of a waiver mooney 
said 
the consent decree prohibited the seven baby bells from 
competing in information services businesses such as home banking 
shopping or electronic yellow pages the decree also prohibited the 
phone companies from owning cable tv programming out of concern 
that the companies could use their monopoly telephone earning 
powers to price cable tv services unfairly 
nonbell companies such as general telephone in california a 
division of gte corp are allowed to operate cable systems outside 
the telephone companies local service areas the federal 
communications commission last year granted gte a waiver to that 
crossownership rule allowing gte to build a cable system in the 
los angeles suburb of cerritos 
ncta has challenged that waiver and the fcc is scheduled to 
consider the challenge next week 
group ws chicago cable operation serves more than 97000 
subscribers in a franchise area encompassing 410000 homes 
we believe cable television is a promising line of business 
for us said sam ginn chairman and chief executive officer of 
pacific telesis 
the department of justice has approved the terms of pacific 
telesis proposed option and is notifying us district judge 
harold h greene who oversaw the atampt breakup of the approval 
the corporation expects to file a waiver request with the court 
this summer 
last year pacific telesis invested in cable television 
operations in london with jones intercable inc as its partner 
the divestiture agreement that outlines what types of businesses 
the regional telephone holding companies may pursue in the united 
states requires a company requesting a waiver to show that there 
is no substantial possibility that it could use its monopoly power 
to impede competition in the market it seeks to enter 
ginn said he is optimistic about the prospects for receiving a 
waiver
