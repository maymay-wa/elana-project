a federal magistrate on wednesday denied a request 
by ousted panamanian leader manuel noriega for an immediate 
inventory and inspection of materials seized from his homes and 
offices since the us invasion of panama 
prosecutors already have promised to provide an inventory of 
seized documents and materials but defense attorneys say the 
government is dragging its feet and claim officials may remove or 
destroy materials critical to noriegas case 
defense counsel has reason to believe that some documents and 
tangible objects have been stolen by members of the us 
military forces occupying panama the motion said in order to 
avoid any more mishandling compliance with the previous order is 
mandatory 
the us attorneys office is dragging its feet noriega 
attorney steven kollin told magistrate william c turnoff who last 
month ordered that an inventory be provided to the defense 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
declined to comment on whether any potential evidence in the 
possession of the military had disappeared 
we do not believe anything has been removed from inventory 
in miami she said 
turnoff set a hearing for feb 14 to check the progress in 
providing such lists 
while turnoff said its critical the defense be provided access 
to all materials he denied the motion for a prompt inventory and 
immediate access to seized material 
we fear that this material will be lost or destroyed or 
somehow disappear kollin said 
one concern about the noriega case was that some materials could 
be used by the defense to make embarrassing disclosures of 
sensitive intelligence information kollin said some material 
seized by the military may be favorable to his clients case 
prosecutors have agreed to provide lists of noriega materials 
but complains the defense hasnt provided specific details about 
locations of his homes and offices 
during the hearing turnoff suggested that a cutoff date be set 
for the government to provide the inventory 
but assistant us attorney michael p sullivan protested 
saying discovery is a continuing process under the law and the 
court should not set a deadline turnoff instead set the status 
hearing 
the magistrate said he has found that the government has made 
a goodfaith effort to comply but i want them to continue their 
efforts 
kollin said he intended to go to panama to view the items listed 
in inventory but he was told by sullivan in a letter that the 
government has no objection but cannot guarantee access 
at kollins request turnoff directed that material in the 
inventory be withheld from the panamanian government sullivan said 
he might appeal that part of the order 
were not in a position to direct the us government not to 
turn over materials to panama

in the christmas weekend killings of four family members who were 
bound shot and set on fire during a robbery died wednesday in a 
shootout with police 
his mother was charged with seconddegree murder in the case

turner 33 was killed by officers gunfire or by a blast from his 
own shotgun he was holding the shotgun to his chin when officers 
burst into his apartment said state police superintendent thomas 
constantine 
turners 2yearold child was turned over to social workers 
authorities had a warrant charging turner with the dec 22 
murders of warren harris 39 dolores harris 41 and their 
children 15yearold shelby and 11yearold marc 
turners mother shirley kinge 54 was arraigned wednesday 
night in dryden town court on four counts of seconddegree murder 
and one count each of arson and criminal possession of stolen 
property town justice edwin sweetland ordered her held without 
bail in tompkins county jail 
according to court papers police discovered ms kinges 
fingerprints on a gasoline can found in the harris home police 
also alleged she used a bank card belonging to warren and delores 
harris to get 200 from an automatic teller machine 
police discovered the bodies the morning of dec 23 after a 
neighbor reported hearing a smoke alarm in the harris farm house 
in an affluent section of this ithaca suburb 
the parents and marc were found in one room bound hand and 
foot with pillowcases over their heads constantine said each had

guns and would shoot it out with officers if they tried to arrest 
him constantine said 
investigators said they dont have any other suspects

the title character in imagining brad has no 
arms no legs almost no hair cauliflower ears and flaky crusty 
skin that makes him look in the words of his wifes good friend 
like a christmas cookie 
these are some of the qualities that make brad an ideal husband 
according to peter hedges dark comedy that the circle repertory 
company brought to offbroadways players theater on tuesday night 
but as the centerpiece of hedges blessedly short 80minute play 
brad who is neither seen nor heard makes for less than riveting 
dramatic material 
the comedy a bleak meditation on marriage is absurd without 
being insightful the characters are long on weirdness short on 
sympathy much of the play consists of tedious unenlightening 
conversations between brads wife she is never identified by name 
and dana sue her new best friend 
in church at bars even driving around town the two women 
discuss their men dana sue cant speak highly enough of her 
husband whom she describes as handsome and a good lover its only 
later in the evening that the audience discovers that he is a 
violent man 
but brads wife is content with her mate their relationship is 
a happy one even if it only consists of her singing songs to her 
bedridden husband the woman even suggests that dana sue ditch her 
husband for a man like brad there are a lot of them out there she 
confides better a vegetable than a wifebeater hedges seems to be 
saying 
the play includes a prologue a long speech by a girl named 
valerie who grows up to be brads wife its her birthday but she 
spends most of the time talking about her first menstrual cycle 
either on the phone to her girlfriends or holding a mock news 
conference about it 
director joe mantello allows the charming melissa joan hart who 
plays the the teenage valerie to rush through her monologue 
making some of it unintelligible sharon ernster gives a good ol 
girl performance complete with honeydipped southern accent as 
dana sue while erin cressida wilson displays an earnest looniness 
that lends brads wife some credibility 
but the play isnt funny enough to be a comedy no matter how 
outrageous its situations or compelling enough to be a good drama 
like its inert hero imagining brad just lies there

cartoonists have become the conscience of hong 
kong as they acidly etch the desperation felt by a people destined 
to live under the flag of communist china in seven years 
with politicians bickering and editorial writers anxious not to 
irritate the leaders in beijing comic strips have become one of 
the few platforms where hong kongs fears are expressed with often 
brutal clarity 
just after the crackdown june 4 in beijing on the democracy 
movement cartoonist juan tze drew premier li peng in a bathtub of 
blood 
is it hot enough asked a soldier holding a bucket of 
steaming peoples blood 
after sir geoffrey howe then the british foreign secretary 
told hong kong that britain could not guarantee the territorys 
future larry feign an american expatriate summed up the feelings 
of many 
i dont know who to hate more deng xiaoping or margaret 
thatcher says one of his comic strip characters 
after 149 years of british rule hong kong returns to china in 
1997 although beijing has promised to retain the territorys 
freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years many of hong 
kongs 57 million people lost faith in that promise after the june 
4 crackdown 
many also have little confidence in factionridden local 
politicians says joseph ys cheng a leading educator and writer 
in the colony newspapers also practice selfcensorship in their 
criticism of beijing he said 
people look to comic strips as an outlet for their 
frustrations cheng said their popularity demonstrates that we 
have a solid groundswell of anticommunist antichina feeling 
especially after june 4 
adds feign cartoons appeal to the chinese becaus you can get 
your meaning across indirectly 
cheng said that only in the last few years have comic strips 
become an important political outlet in hong kong a recent 
exhibition of cartoons at the hong kong arts centre drew 40000 
people over several weeks 
feign and juan are perhaps the two best known cartoonists in the 
colony 
frenetic and balding feign 34 is author of a comic strip for 
the englishlanguage south china morning post called the world of 
lily wong 
for the five years since he moved to hong kong from orange 
county in california with his chinese wife feign has charted the 
lives of lily a smart sexy hong kong woman and stuart wright a 
bumbling but goodhearted american 
stuart wants to marry lily and give her the passport she covets 
but lily isnt in love and so far has refused him through their 
relationship feign explores the often blatant racism inflicted on 
chinese by westerners he also pokes fun at the ways chinese view 
westerners known as devils in cantonese 
a tall man with the comportment of a mandarin official in old 
chinas imperial court juan is more selfconsciously political 
than feign 
he grew up during hong kongs most turbulent times and remembers 
watching the bloody antibritish riots in 1967 from a rickety 
balcony on his tenement home he began drawing comics as an art 
student at the chinese university of hong kong in the 1970s 
he took a page from early 20th century chinese history during 
which cartoons were a popular form of political agitation and 
decided to use comics to fight for hong kongs common man he went 
to work at the chineselanguage ming pao 
my generation is different from my parents said juan now 
33 they came from china and are concerned with basic things like 
food and money we are searching for other things from the 
spirit 
when china recently announced its opposition to a british plan 
to give passports to key hong kong professionals and officials 
juan drew a man sitting on his bed his birth certificate identity 
card and passport scattered beneath him who am i who am i 
the man screamed as his wife snored beside him 
we have an identity crisis in hong kong juan said london 
and beijing are deciding our fate and we cant influence them i 
wanted to describe our feeling of hopelessness 
following the crackdown in beijing juan drew chinese premier li 
peng explaining why tanks were used to put down the rebellion we 
ran out of cars li tells a visitor 
another strip shows an englishman offering hong kong on a fork 
into the drooling mouth of a corrupt chinese cadre be a brave 
chinaman the englishman says 
juan who hopes to stay in hong kong after 1997 has recently 
published a book of his work black goods 
i guess the chinese might call me a counterrevolutionary he 
said with a wry smile im just helping them gather proof 
if juan expresses the desperation of hong kong feign captures 
the absurdity of its life 
living on the cusp of two worlds hong kong chinese and western 
expatriate feign has a unique vantage point 
in the beginning my position gave me a chance to pull off a 
lot of good gags said feign but now as things get serious i 
find it harder to draw its becoming a tragedy

prince charles appealed to architects and planners 
to minimize their use of tropical hardwoods whose harvest is one 
cause of rampant deforestation 
the sands of time in the tropical hour glass are running out 
fast and we cant turn it upside down and watch the sands run out 
again charles said tuesday in a speech to the royal botanical 
gardens 
despite agreements to import only timber grown in sustainably 
managed forests it is impossible to know whether given shipments 
come from properly managed forests or not he said 
charles criticized the international tropical timber 
organization for making no mention of the rights and needs of the 
forestdwellers in its articles of agreement and said new 
mechanisms are needed to protect rainforest regions 
this is clearly a massive challenge but it seems to be that 
we cannot simply go on talking about the need to protect the 
worlds rain forests and not create the kind of institutions and 
mechanisms which will actually make that possible charles said

despite its early worries about reporters 
safety during president bushs drug summit next week in colombia 
the white house will let an expanded press pool cover the meeting 
that was reported tuesday by tim russert nbcs washington 
bureau chief chairman of the network tv pool covering the oneday 
trip 
this is an extremely difficult sensitive trip because of the 
security but the white house accomodated us in everything we 
certainly television broadcasting asked for said russert 
the fournation drug summit is being held in cartagena a 
coastal town on colombias caribbean side about 400 miles north of 
the capitol city of bogota 
the usual white house press contingent 11 reporters 
traditionally fly with bush on air force one followed by others on 
a chartered plane will go with him to cartagena russert said 
in addition an expanded press pool will be allowed to accompany 
the president to the actual meeting site at barranquilla 65 miles 
to the northeast 
the expanded pool could have as many as 35 members said sig 
rogich a white house spokesman he estimated that at least several 
hundred foreign and american news staffers will be on hand in 
cartagena 
each us network will be allowed to send a correspondent and a 
camera crew to the actual summit meeting russert said contrasting 
that with the usual pool arrangement in which one network team 
provides coverage for all 
after the meeting bush is to hold a news conference rogich 
said he said he had no additional details but network officials 
expect the press conference will be held in cartagena 
there have been reports of threats of violence against bush and 
others in colombia by drug lords angered by the columbian 
governments crackdwn on their operations cbs news said last month 
that drug terrorists were buying surfacetoair missiles to try to 
shoot down bushs plane 
on jan 24 white house spokesman marlin fitzwater citing 
worries about reporters safety said the secret service was 
confident it could protect bush in colombia but had no authority to 
protect journalists covering his trip 
no network anchor is scheduled to go to the colombian summit 
although nbc nightly news anchor tom brokaw flew to bogota last 
weekend to tape reports and interviews as part of nbcs reportage 
on bushs trip 
brokaw said that although he was more uneasy while on a story in 
beirut you can certainly sense the tension in bogota where 
the drug war has made fear and personal weapons part of daily life 
everybodys armed and everybody who can afford one drives a 
big mercedes with armor plating he said 
russert said white house officials with whom he discussed 
televison coverage of bushs trip cited nothing specific that they 
worried about but they obviously are extremely concerned about 
security 
and frankly so are news organizations he said 
however abc news vice president jeff gralnick downplayed the 
potential of danger to reporters 
right now we havent heard anything from our people in 
cartagena that says get excited gralnick said 
were going to be cautious and and sensitive to cirumstances 
that might exist he said wed be crazy not to 
but we have had people in and out of colombia since this 
drug story first became a major concern and theyre all fine 
and they continue to be fine

the nose knows without any help from 
the legal system but a grand jury report tells residents what they 
know already 
jacksonville smells 
the grand jury issued the report on june 14 1988 but it had 
been sealed as two paper mills and two chemical plants criticized 
in the report challenged it in court the four companies say that 
have taken expensive steps to eliminate smelly emissions 
i dont think we need a grand jury to tell us jacksonville 
smells said dick kennedy a frequent critic of the citys 
pollution policies 
i dont think anybody should be put out of business but i 
think they should stay out of court and spend their money cleaning 
up the air said kennedy who said he lives downwind from the two 
paper mills 
after months of court challenges chief circuit judge john e 
santora ordered the report released monday evening 
the history of jacksonvilles achievements is preceded only by 
its reputation as the city that smells to each of us 
individually and to the community as a whole this situation can 
only be termed an embarrassment the report said 
the report by the 23member panel said emissions have resulted 
in more than 4000 citizen complaints since 1985 
the odors have an adverse impact on their property values and 
unreasonably interfere with their health welfare and comfortable 
enjoyment of life and property it said 
mayor tommy hazouri has campaigned to clean up jacksonvilles 
odors and the city council approved a tough antiodor ordinance to 
cite offending industries in march 1988 parts of which have been 
thrown out by the courts 
the panel also found that local industries have not taken all 
the steps they could to solve odor problems and could have made 
improvements years ago 
the grand jury report concluded that if industries fail to get 
rid of stinky odors that city state and federal officials should 
pursue civil and criminal remedies to stop further emissions 
at the same time the grand jury indicted scm glidco organics 
corp jefferson smurfit corp seminole kraft corp and union camp 
corp for violating air pollution laws the charges since have 
either been dropped or struck down 
the four companies challenged the report and santora jr 
ordered it sealed 
the florida timesunion and the state attorneys office 
challenged the sealing of the report the case wound its way up to 
the 1st district court of appeals and through another round of 
motions before santora ordered it released 
chief assistant state attorney john delaney said tuesday he 
wishes the report could have been released when the grand jury 
completed its work 
john baggett operations director for union camp said tuesday 
the chemical company fought the presentment because it was unfair 
to the industries 
we were not objecting to the fact that there are objectionable 
odors in jacksonville baggett said we did not agree with 
their broadbrush approach that the industries had done nothing to 
address the problem 
union camp has spent about 1 million in 1988 and 1989 
installing and improving equipment to cut down on odors 
but he said the company had committed to do that before the 
grand jury investigation 
the report is grossly biased factually deficient and very 
misleading to the general public said scm glidco president 
george robbins his company has spent more than 2 million to 
reduce odors 
robbins pointed out that about a third of the odor complaints in 
1989 were directed at plants operated by the city of jacksonville 
most of them concerned a sewage treatment plant fewer than 7 
percent of the complaints involved scm glidco 
seminole kraft a paper mill announced last week that it was 
spending 100 million to convert is cardboardmaking process to use 
recycled cardboard instead of wood chips eliminating a major 
source of odor

president bush told us troops taking 
part in war games tuesday that political proposals by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev are encouraging but that america 
must not let changes in eastern europe lull us into a sense of 
complacency 
the president getting a firsthand look at us forces in 
action declared military challenges to democracy persist in 
every hemisphere and america must always be prepared to fight for 
freedom and security 
critics especially congressional democrats contend that bushs 
military budget ignores the dismantling of the communist empire 
the president defended his plan to make military cuts in select 
areas such as bases but to spend more on strategic weapons as 
he began a threeday trip combining visits to defense installations 
with republican fundraising 
a continent away the democratic chairman of the house armed 
services committee kept up the pressure for changes saying the 
administrations 2921 billion defense budget with a continued 
emphasis on big strategic programs such as longrange missiles 
fails to match the new political realities at home or abroad 
this administrations approach reflects old thinking rather 
than these new realities rep les aspin of wisconsin said at a 
congressional hearing in washington 
bush told the soldiers the us army the premier land force in 
the world today he said the realistic battles you wage here 
forge tactical expertise leadership and a fighting spirit and 
thats what we need 
bushs talk was carried by radio to troops on both sides of the 
mock battle at fort irwins national training center in the remote 
mojave desert 
now back to the war bush said 
weve never stopped a battle before to listen to the president 
on the radio joked army col michael ryan chief of plans and 
operation 
bush in his first remarks on changes proposed on monday by 
gorbachev said i can speak for all americans when i say we are 
pleased to see chairman gorbachevs proposals to expand steps 
toward political pluralism in the soviet union 
its especially encouraging to see anything which might bring 
the day of true democracy a bit closer to the soviet people 
from a ridge bush watched puffs of smoke emerging from tank 
columns saw bursts of artillery shells and saw planes sweeping low 
to provide air cover over the desert valley floor 
he watched as the team portraying a sovietstyle opposing 
force smashed through the defending sides lines 
bush watched the simulated battle from hill 781 his tie off a 
khaki jacket over his shirt military binoculars around his neck 
his wife barbara was nearby wearing a colorful jogging suit 
after his remarks he heard the commander of the blue army 
from fort lewis wash col a j bergeron tell him over a 
television monitor this for us is a training super bowl 
he said he was absolutely delighted that bush came however 
one of his men 2nd lt barry hale hit in the simulated 
battle said ruefully to reporters we would have been great if 
we hadnt been blocked from going around hill 781 they called 
it a chemically contaminated area 
bush in his formal remarks said it is important not to let 
encouraging changes political or military lull us into a 
sense of complacency nor can we let down our guard against a 
worldwide threat 
the soviet union still does maintain formidable forces he 
said 
bush said that the us military would face its share of 
uncertainties and danger in the years ahead despite the current 
easing of tensions 
the president said his defense strategy is one of active forces 
which are smaller but more agile and flexible such as the 
contingent sent to panama in the raid against gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
later in los angeles the president again trumpeted his 1991 
defense budget at a 1000aplate fundraising dinner for 
california republicans 
as the nature of the threats to american security change so 
too must our response bush said our forces will remain 
robust welltrained highly professional but geared to the new 
array of challenges of the 90s 
bush cited rapid and welcome change as people from panama to 
prague strive for democracy but he said the lessening of 
eastwest tensions should not lessen the military mission only 
refocus it 
switching subjects to fit his gop audience bush lashed out at 
democratic gerrymandering in california that he said had made 
it hard in the past for republicans to win house seats 
noting that new congressional district lines will be drawn after 
this years census bush declared the time has come for 
redistricting reform 
bush and other speakers was interrupted by five hecklers at 
various times three shouting something about el salvador and two 
something about aids all were led from the room 
after one interruption bush adlibbed pretty tough 
several hundred demonstrators paraded for a variety of causes 
outside the hotel 
the militaryspending debate also includes an issue some have 
portrayed as political the bush plan calls for closing or scaling 
down 72 us military installations many of them in democrats 
districts 
in his wargames remarks bush declared as we enter the 
1990s the united states is shaping its military to meet a changing 
international environment one that may be potentially safer but 
one that will almost surely have its share of uncertainties and 
dangers 
he praised the dec 20 1989 invasion of panama that toppled 
noriega as an example of the kind of role he envisions for the 
modern military

one artist grasped the importance of what was 
happening in england in the 18th century when he chose scientific 
demonstrations iron forges and blacksmiths shops for his 
peculiar subjects 
joseph wrights first major show in london opening today comes 
almost 200 years after his death 
he deserved one before but this often happens in england 
said nicholas serota director of the tate gallery at tuesdays 
preview 
to avoid confusion with artists of the same name wright was 
known in his lifetime as wright of derby the midlands town where 
he was born and worked he died in 1797 and the title has stuck 
ever since 
his most famous picture is of a group of people watching a 
demonstrator pump air from a glass globe causing a bird inside to 
flutter in distress as it loses oxygen the viewers react in 
fascination or shock and one covers her eyes 
a critic who saw it in 1768 wrote mr wright of derby is a 
very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way 
in those days peculiar meant individual or unlike 
others says the exhibition organizer judy egerton who has 
gathered about 200 works from around the world for the show 
two years earlier wright had shown another unique painting of 
a lecturer explaining the workings of an orrery a clockwork model 
of the solar system his listeners including two little boys are 
entranced and one man makes notes 
there are no pictures like these anywhere else art historians 
say 
the scene in each painting is illuminated by a candle lamp 
demonstrating wrights mastery of light effects his industrial 
pictures show workers lit by the fires at which they work metals 
wrights scientific and industrial paintings won for him the 
honor of being the first artist to directly express the spirit of 
the industrial revolution 
he was gripped by fire and light and returning in 1775 from a 
visit to italy he brought his paintings of the annual firework 
display in rome the girandola and of a nighttime eruption of the 
vesuvius volcano 
all these are in the tate show along with many of the portraits 
by which wright earned the bulk of his income 
wright fell into obscurity in the 19th century but in the 
1920s he was appreciated by american collectors serota said 
his paintings then rose in value in 1984 londons national 
gallery paid 17 million at auction for his portrait mr and 
mrs coltman 
wright had charged coltman 63 pounds for it in 1771 then the 
equivalent of about 300 
the wright of derby exhibition goes to paris this summer and 
to the metropolitan museum of art in new york in the fall the 
first time the tate has loaned a show to the met serota added 
wright captures the excitement of scientific discovery said 
david fraser curator of derbys museums 
derby art gallery has the largest collection of wrights work 
because its residents admired him and contributed in victorian 
times to the museums purchase of his paintings 
in the 1960s the derby church he was buried in was demolished 
and its site now lies under a beltway his remains were so 
carelessly reburied in a local cemetery that no one now quite knows 
where they are the curator said 
the exhibition is at the tate gallery through april 22 at the 
paris grand palais may 17 through july 23 and at the new york 
metropolitan museum of art sept 6 through dec 2

billionaire tax evader leona helmsley has denied 
ever telling a housekeeper only the little people pay taxes 
and predicts she will not go to prison because ive done 
nothing 
in her first interview since her august conviction helmsley 
told a current affair that the quote was an out and out lie 
this is the most ludicrous ridiculous thing that ever 
happened to me in my entire life 
we paid a fortune in taxes and i sat down with a housekeeper 
and i said do you know that only the little people pay taxes 
she said her voice rising mockingly 
this is nonsense she told interviewer cindy adams adding 
then im the little people im the one paying the taxes we paid 
344 million i really dont know where it came from but it 
didnt come from this mouth 
the interview was taped at her central park south apartment on 
jan 29 it will be broadcast nationally tonight and thursday on 
the fox network 
helmsley who was convicted of evading more than 12 million in 
federal taxes between 1983 and 1985 was sentenced to four years in 
prison and ordered to pay a 71 million fine and 17 million in 
back taxes she is free on 25 million bail pending an appeal 
asked how she will survive if her appeal fails helmsley said 
if i went to jail im not going to jail ive done nothing i 
cant believe that the system in the united states of america 
has stopped working 
several times during the interview helmsley tried to keep her 
voice from cracking when talking about the trial and dabbed her 
nose with a tissue when asked about her lawyers assertion in court 
that she was a tough bitch 
she said she may have cultivated that image by being tough on 
her employees and said if you pet me ill purr but if you hit 
me i might scratch of course 
the 69yearold hotel magnate said she was terrified of what 
was happening to her adding its like being on a roller 
coaster youre just being pushed with no control whatsoever 
since her trial she said she and her husband harry dont 
go anywhere but added that when they do reporters are always 
nearby 
during a recent trip to arizona she said there were 
helicopters flying over the house and when they went to the beach 
near their sarasota fla home there was a reporter lying on the 
sand and he had his camera aimed at us its terribly unfair

khmer rouge guerrillas have made 
major gains since vietnamese troops left in september and worry 
grows that the movement which ruled cambodia with terror in the 
late 1970s may regain power 
guerrilla and western officials say khmer rouge fighters have 
overrun dozens of government positions capturing a 250mile 
stretch of territory in northern and western cambodia 
they have closed many jungle camps on the thai border and moved 
tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers to the newly seized 
areas including the gemmining district of pailin in battambang 
province 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians were executed or died of 
disease or starvation while the communist khmer rouge ruled 
cambodia from april 1975 until the vietnamese invasion of december 
1978 that overthrew pol pots government 
the khmer rouge says those days are gone and it has changed 
mit noly a guerrilla major interviewed on a trip through the 
region said in the district capital of tmar puok we are trying 
to separate ourselves from the past we are willing to accept the 
will of the people 
in 1982 we changed our struggle became one of national 
liberation against the vietnamese our policy is now one of 
justice we tell people that theft is wrong that murder is wrong 
western analysts say however that pol pot and others who 
directed the massacres of the 1970s remain in control there is 
considerable documentation of continued human rights violations by 
the khmer rouge in recent years 
thousands of civilians under khmer rouge control serve as 
porters to move food weapons and military supplies from border to 
the new base camps according to the reports by guerrilla and 
western officials 
ok serie sopheak of the noncommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation front another group fighting the vietnamsponsored 
government of premier hun sen the khmer rouge have been very 
successful on the battlefield they now operate quite freely almost 
everywhere in the country 
the tour of northwestern cambodia sometimes involved traveling 
in jeeps supplied by the chinese the khmer rouges main 
supporters and eating in marketplaces 
khmer rouge guerrillas could be seen in dozens of newly captured 
villages visiting relatives and mingling with villagers who went 
about their regular work of the harvest season 
other guerrillas were en route to interior provinces such as 
kompong thom where they must operate far from the supply lines 
leading from the thai border 
analysts say that despite its bloody record the khmer rouge 
has recruited thousands of fighters and continues to get some help 
from villagers as its units move deeper inside cambodia 
they are seen by many as patriots a senior thai 
intelligence officer said privately in rural cambodia the 
average villager is not nearly as opposed to the khmer rouge as the 
international community 
outside the country the analysts say the more the khmer rouge 
wins on the battlefield the more it loses diplomatically 
after the khmer rouge seized its first district capital 
pailin in october several western countries tried to isolate it 
fearful of a return to power 
the khmer rouge is the strongest member of a threeparty 
resistance coalition that also includes the noncommunist forces of 
prince norodom sihanouk and the khmer peoples national liberation 
front 
khmer rouge guerrillas increased attacks after the vietnamese 
withdrawal in the last days of september and now control more 6250 
square miles in the north and west according to thai and western 
intelligence sources much of the area is sparsely populated 
since september the khmer rouge has captured at least three 
district capitals in battambang and siem riep provinces in 
january its guerrillas attacked battambangs provincial capital 
also called battambang 
thai intelligence officers close to khmer rouge leaders say the 
plan is to to capture battambang before monsoon rains start in 
april battambang is cambodias secondlargest city after phnom 
penh the capital 
a western diplomat in bangkok said they are cutting roads 
trying to isolate battambang if all supply lines can be cut they 
can seize the city 
according to intelligence sources the khmer rouge recognizes 
its increased isolation and is ready if china yields to 
international pressure and cuts off aid 
the guerrillas are reported to have arms and ammunition caches 
throughout cambodia western diplomats and ruby miners say the 
khmer rouge collects the equivalent of more than 500000 a month 
in taxes from gem miners in pailin which the guerrillas captured 
oct 22 
if all international support stopped tommorrow the khmer 
rouge could fight for five more years a thai intelligence 
officer said if the khmer rouge are shut out of a peace 
settlement there will be no peace

authorities seized 17 tons of weapons from a 
ship that had arrived from europe and the united states and said 
they were investigating to determine who was responsible for the 
shipment 
the attorney generals office showed reporters the haul which 
included 270 rifles 4988 cartridges machine guns pistols and 
other firearms 
until now we have not detained anyone because the shipment 
was going to a dummy company called super comercial agropecuaria 
san pablo the attorney generals office said in a statement 
the mexican flag ship sonora left belgium on dec 5 and stopped 
in the netherlands west germany france miami and houston before 
arriving in veracruz on jan 27 the statement said 
the weapons were in a container labeled as containing garbanzo 
paste from lebanon the government said the statement did not say 
where the arms were loaded onto the ship 
one spokesman for the attorney generals office said the weapons 
could be destined for mexican drug traffickers while another 
speculated that they were headed for another country

when porn queen annie sprinkle performed her 
stage show members of the audience might have thought they saw 
art but when rep dana rohrabacher heard about it he saw red 
the national endowment for the arts is at it again the 
conservative california republican exclaimed in the headline over a 
letter to his house colleagues accusing the federal arts agency of 
using tax funds to subsidize pornography 
endowment chairman john e frohnmayer says his agency didnt 
underwrite miss sprinkles sexually explicit show at the kitchen a 
private avantgarde performing arts center in lower manhattan he 
said the endowment gave the kitchen 60000 last year solely for 
the theaters operating expenses 
rohrabacher didnt actually see miss sprinkle perform but relied 
on press reports for the lurid details 
during one breathless pause in her act rohrabacher said the 
star of 150 xrated videos commented usually i get paid a lot of 
money for this but tonight its governmentfunded 
the program for the show included a post porn modernist 
manifesto that said its adherents celebrate sex as the 
nourishing life giving force and utilize sexually explicit 
words pictures and performances to communicate our ideas and 
emotions 
rohrabacher urged his fellow house members to remind frohnmayer 
he is dealing with taxpayer funds and is accountable for how they 
are spent just like every other head of every other federal 
agency 
if the nea cant hold itself responsible to the us taxpayer 
its our job to make them responsible he said 
barbara tsumagari executive director of the kitchen said in 
new york that miss sprinkles 12 performances were not financed 
with federal funds 
ms tsumagari said the new york state council on the arts which 
receives funds from the nea gave a 25000 grant to underwrite 
part of the kitchens current season of 54 performances but 
specifically excluded miss sprinkles show 
that was confirmed by state arts council spokesman tim mulligan 
who said her presentation was not of an artistic quality to 
warrant council support 
frohnmayer in a telephone interview said the nea gave the new 
york arts council a 500000 grant last year for staff salaries and 
other administrative expenses 
rohrabachers press secretary david eisner said the 
congressman plans to circulate similar letters about every week to 
highlight further examples of what eisner called the endowments 
use of tax dollars for triplex hardcore pornographic stuff 
eisner said nea supporters dismiss such reports as isolated 
incidents but we are starting a campaign to really work hard 
to show thats not the case this is a systemic problem 
rohrabachers campaign could prove politically embarrassing to 
frohnmayer as the house and senate prepare for hearings on 
legislation authorizing an extension of the neas life 
last october a controversy over endowment support for a 
traveling exhibition of photographs by robert mapplethorpe 
including some sexually explicit photos led congress to include a 
ban on federal funds for obscene art in the neas 171 million 
budget a rohrabacher proposal to abolish the arts endowment was 
rejected 
i dont intend to rise to the bait any time someone comes up 
with a new horror story frohnmayer said tuesday 
i want to make it very clear that we do not fund anything that 
is obscene and in fact my view is that art and obscenity are 
mutually exclusive terms he said i think those who oppose 
obscenity and i count myself among them might more fruitfully 
look elsewhere

the dogma may be toned down a bit but in many 
respects president bushs first annual report on the state of the 
us economy could just as easily have been former president 
reagans ninth 
when bush sent congress his 419page epistle on the economy 
tuesday all the hits from yesteryear were playing once again 
tax cuts to stimulate growth 
balanced budgets down the road just a bit accomplished without 
the need for higher taxes 
promises of economic growth as far as the eye can see 
just as they did with reagans economic outlooks the critics 
griped about overly optimistic economic forecasts and accused the 
republicans of promoting tax cuts for the wealthy in the guise of 
boosting investment 
they charged bush failed to note the biggest policy failures of 
the reagan era the mountain of federal debt and the huge trade 
deficits which have transformed america from the worlds largest 
creditor country to the largest debtor nation 
bush officials meanwhile complained the critics ignored the 
reagan eras successes including an unprecedented seven straight 
years of peacetime economic growth and the creation of more than 20 
million jobs while inflation was kept under control 
this economic debate which raged for all of reagans two terms 
likely will continue for some time to come 
democrats aimed much of their fire tuesday at bushs tax 
proposals his economic report repeated his call for a capital 
gains tax cut and a new family savings account to let americans put 
away up to 5000 a year in taxfree savings accounts 
the critics called the capital gains tax cut a giveaway to the 
wealthy and said the savings plan would not boost americans dismal 
savings rate any more than similar plans advanced during the reagan 
years 
tinkering with the tax code is the worst thing we could do 
this is just gimmickry that we are going to suffer for in the long 
run complained rep dan rostenkowski dill and chairman of the 
house ways and means committee 
bushs first economic report of the president did offer some 
subtle changes by avoiding some of the more doctrinaire monetary 
and supplyside economic positions sounded during the reagan years 
in a departure from the monetarist leanings of reagan 
economists bushs report warned against relying on rigid 
monetary targeting in which the central bank focuses solely on 
controlling the growth of the nations money supply to hold down 
inflation 
bushs report gave general approval to the feds work under 
chairman alan greenspan saying the central bank was correct in 
using a variety of economic barometers to direct interest rate 
policies 
bush extolled the benefits of free markets and open world trade 
while proclaiming the primary economic goal of my administration 
is to achieve the highest possible rate of sustainable economic 
growth growth is the key to raising living standards to leaving a 
legacy of prosperity for our children to uplifting those most in 
need and to maintaining americas leadership in the world 
asked to explain the differences between reagan and bush on 
economic issues michael boskin bushs chief economic adviser 
suggested the primary difference lies in the two mens views of 
government 
i think that president reagan believed that not only was the 
government the problem but that it was rare indeed that government 
could be a positive force in solving the problem boskin said 
bush is more willing to use government to solve problems in such 
fields as promoting longterm research fighting illegal drugs or 
boosting support for the head start preschool program boskin said 
adding that bush does believe in some areas the federal 
government has an important role to play

president bush will spend a good part of this 
election year traveling about mixing politics with war and with 
peace and maybe with the environment education crime and the 
battle against drugs as well 
any time bush mixes a political appearance with an official 
presidential event it reduces the amount the republican party must 
pay for his appearance 
in this congressional election year people can expect to see 
bush making plenty of stops combining political and nonpolitical 
events 
some critics see the tactic as a partial taxpayer subsidy for 
political activity in any event bush is not the first president 
to do it nor likely to be the last 
this weeks threestate swing focusing on national defense 
issues is a good example of mixing the business of politics with 
the nations business 
on tuesday bushs first stop in southern california was to 
watch army war games in the mojave desert and to talk to us 
troops 
afterward he came to los angeles for an evening 1000aplate 
gop fundraiser for sen pete wilson who is running for governor of 
california 
election law requires political parties or candidates to pay for 
purely political visits by a president and the cost of moving a 
president and his entourage can be quite high 
thus the fact that bush had an official event in the same state 
as the fundraiser means taxpayers will bear some of the cost of the 
visit on a prorated basis 
further official stops today a foreign policy speech in san 
francisco and a tour of a laboratory where star wars research is 
done will also trim the cost to california republicans for 
getting bush to the wilson fundraiser 
on thursday bush will combine a visit to the strategic air 
command headquarters in omaha neb with a fundraising breakfast 
for nebraskas republican gov kay orr the sac tour will help 
defray the cost to the nebraska gop 
then before returning to washington he will tour a head start 
center in colombus ohio the political twin an ohio gop dinner 
this should be a very good trip emphasizing some of our 
defense requirements needs and a little politics mixed in here 
bush told reporters accompanying him aboard air force one well 
be doing more of that this year 
it raises a serious question about abuse of taxpayer funds 
said ellen miller director of the center for responsive politics 
in washington dc a private organization that studies the role of 
money in politics 
she said the key is whether the president would have made the 
trip anyway without the political event or whether the official 
appearances were just added to generate a partial taxpayer subsidy 
for a political visit 
not surprisingly white house spokeswoman alixe glen says the 
official business not the political stops pace the presidents 
schedule 
he goes on trips to get his message out she said but she 
added on the flip side the president is very committed to the 
republican party 
bush a former national gop chairman started combining 
presidential business with politics early on last fall he combined 
a fundraising speech for rep lynn martin rill a 1990 senate 
candidate with a trip to a chicago innercity school where he 
talked about drugs 
earlier this year he mixed an appearance at a glitzy miami 
hotel fundraiser for florida gov bob martinez with a meeting with 
a group of sixth graders in everglades national park 
would bush have made the official trip to the everglades in 
the absence of the miami fundraiser doubtful claims bob dreyfus 
of public citizen a watchdog group set up by consumer advocate 
ralph nader 
dreyfus says the practice of scheduling official visits to help 
defray the costs of political visits is a flagrant abuse of the 
public trust 
but many political veterans see it as a legitimate way to 
exercise the powers of the presidency 
stephen hess a political analyst at the brookings institution 
in washington said the president is both president of all and 
at the same time the titular elder of his party its sometimes 
hard to balance those two conflicting interests 
i dont think its all bad hess added i must say if a 
president has nothing better to do its useful for him to get 
around the country and meet the people up close

democrats are attacking the bush 
administrations belief that the united states must keep paying to 
upgrade its strategic force until new ussoviet arms control 
treaties are completed 
defense secretary dick cheney defending his 292 billion 
military budget for fiscal 1991 said tuesday the dramatic changes 
of prodemocracy movements in eastern europe and the diminishing 
soviet threat to the west are in fact reflected in the budget 
president bushs proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 calls for a nearly 1 billion increase in spending on the 
strategic defense initiative 55 billion for the b2 stealth 
bomber and more than 3 billion on two new longrange nuclear 
missiles 
the defense secretary told the house armed services committee 
a good deal of prudence is in order 
cheney argued no major cuts in spending or changes in defense 
strategy should be considered until new arms control treaties are 
completed 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of armed services panel said 
the administration appeared to be trying to use the arms control 
process to justify building both the mobile mx and the smaller 
midgetman missile systems as well as the b2 bomber 
there is old thinking in strategic arms control aspin said 
adding the administration should not be seeking to build the mx and 
midgetman just because they would be permitted under terms of the 
emerging strategic arms reduction talks treaty to reduce both 
superpowers strategic arsenals by up to 50 percent 
you stand logic on its head when you use arms control as an 
argument for a larger defense budget aspin said 
under questioning by aspin gen colin powell the chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff said the service chiefs would reconsider 
their support for the proposed start treaty if congress decided to 
kill either the mx or midgetman programs and if the b2 bomber 
program were canceled 
powell said he personally would have to make a very careful 
reassessment of the start treaty if the b2 program were killed 
aspin said congress may not accept the administrations request 
to buy five b2s in fiscal 1991 and a bipartisan group of 
congressmen introduced legislation to kill the bomber program 
it is as relevant to modern nuclear warfare a the polish 
cavalry was to german tanks in 1939 said rep ron dellums 
dcalif a member of the armed services panel it could only 
effectively be employed after nuclear annihilation had already 
occurred 
rep john kasich rohio another panel member said cheaper 
but just as effective alternatives to the stealth are available 
including cruise missiles that could be fired outside an enemys 
borders 
the bill would allow completion of the 15 planes now in 
production the pentagon plans to build 132 planes at a cost of 
about 70 billion including more than 23 billion that has already 
been spent 
cheneys proposal to close or realign more than 72 domestic 
military facilities and 14 foreign bases prompted charges of 
partisanship from aspin who proposed that an independent 
commission determine the hit list of bases 
you want to work together well close some bases but its 
going to have to be a commission said aspin 
i wonder mr chairman if you would have been as eager to 
hold a press conference to introduce your new commission 
legislation if i had not started with a list cheney said 
aspin rejoined cheney you got to play this thing a little 
less confrontational if you want it to happen

in a report harshly critical of the bush 
administrations policies toward china the human rights group asia 
watch says repression of chinese dissenters is deepening despite 
the lifting of martial law 
the findings largely mirroring a stillconfidential state 
department report on human rights violations in china come as 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger was appearing today 
before the senate foreign relations committee to defend the 
administrations china policy 
some in congress believe the evidence of chinese repression 
makes it even more difficult for bush to defend his current efforts 
at rapprochement just eight months after the brutal crushing of 
the prodemocracy movement 
eagleburger has been at the center of bushs secret 
policymaking traveling on two clandestine trips to china with 
national security adviser brent scowcroft in the months since the 
crackdown 
the administration since the massacre of hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of protesters in beijing last june 4 has reverted 
to a shabby double standard insofar as the question of human rights 
in china is concerned the asia watch report concluded 
the 89page document based largely on press reports catalogs 
continuing arrests of peaceful dissidents secret trials of 
protesters new executions and death sentences and government use 
of torture against political opponents 
it also adds a layer of criticism calling bushs reluctance to 
anger the rulers in beijing a shamefully supine policy and 
concludes the burden of trying to shape a policy that reflects 
concern for human rights still rests largely on the congress 
sources have said the state department report which has been 
sent to capitol hill but not publicly released offers a 
matteroffact recitation of abuses by the beijing government 
throughout 1989 including terming the june 4 tiananmen square 
killings a massacre 
it describes the government of deng xiaoping as a totalitarian 
regime that has tightened its grip on information and throttled 
opposing ideologies while restricting foreign travel and 
suppressing labor and religious groups sources said 
the asia watch report said between 10000 and 30000 people 
remain jailed because of prodemocracy activities the recent 
lifting of martial law in beijing has little significance if 
viewed as anything other than a public relations exercise the 
report contends 
arrests have continued largely in secret right through to 
the present and reports of continued executions persist the 
report said most of those detained have not been charged or tried 
and their families are not told where the prisoners are being held 
it said 
when they are tried verdicts are usually decided upon before 
the trial even begins it said torture of prisoners is common 
and at least 40 people have been executed in connection with the 
events of last june it added 
chinas criminal justice system is among the most deeply 
flawed in the world the report said indeed it is essentially 
premodern 
to sum up it said the continuing arrests and executions 
in china form the cutting edge of a protracted governmentled 
campaign of punitive repression and they serve a purely political 
purpose

scores of blind people are lobbying congress 
to overturn a proposed federal aviation administration rule that 
would bar them from seats next to emergency exits in airliners 
the blind say they have the same rights as anyone else to sit by 
the exit door 
the faa which has not yet announced its final rule is 
proposing the seats be unavailable to blind people or anyone else 
who might not be able to operate the doors quickly or lead other 
passengers to safety 
more than 150 blind people crowded a hallway outside a 
congressional news conference tuesday to protest the faa proposal 
which they predicted soon would become final using seeingeye dogs 
and white canes they then spread through congressional office 
buildings to lobby for the legislation 
the faa proposed last march to prohibit blind or deaf passengers 
or passengers who might inhibit the use of an airliner emergency 
door from sitting in the exit row seats the agency called the 
matter a critical safety issue and said the rule would enhance 
the safety of all passengers 
faa spokesman dick stafford said the agency is in the final 
rulemaking procedure which means it still could impose the rule 
as proposed modify it or withdraw it 
bob marx transportation department spokesman said the 
department is expected to issue next month an access rule that 
would not preclude the faa from imposing safety restrictions on 
seating 
leaders of the national federation of the blind said the 
government actions would be discriminatory and decrease a blind 
persons chances of surviving an airplane crash some airlines 
already prohibit blind travelers from sitting in exitdoor seats 
and several blind people have been arrested in recent years for 
refusing to move from the seats 
a halfdozen members of congress expressed support for bills 
that would ban rules to bar passengers from certain based on 
whether the passenger can see the measure has passed a senate 
committee 
blind people must not be treated as secondclass citizens and 
pushed to the back of the bus said rep james traficant dohio 
chief sponsor of a bill in the house he said there is no evidence 
to show that blind people pose any kind of safety hazard when 
sitting next to airline exit doors 
james gashel government affairs director for the blind 
federation said a sightless passengers ability to maneuver in a 
smokefilled or darkened airliner might actually enhance safety if 
he or she is in a position to lead other passengers 
gashel said the faa rule would give blind people more of a 
chance to die 
gashel told of his own arrest in april 1988 after he refused to 
leave an exit row seat on a united airlines plane more than 200 
other passengers were evacuated the flight was canceled and he was 
carried off the aircraft by police but no charges were filed he 
said 
other blind people have been arrested after refusing to leave 
seats airline rules on the seats differ with some barring 
pregnant women and handicapped people and others allowing 
handicapped people to use the seats if they insist

the bush administrations flexibility plan 
for farmers calls for reviving the nca to use with the arp and arc 
says the usda 
in that way agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday 
farmers would have more choices in planting crops without being 
penalized 
farmers often complain that agriculture department rules to 
control production are too severe and often penalize them for not 
following complicated program regulations straight down the line 
wheat farmers must abide by rules in the wheat program feed 
grains producers following feed grains regulations and so on if 
there is deviation the acreage base or history of a crop may be 
reduced thereby meaning reduced usda payments and other benefits 
current law passed in 1985 expires at the end of the 1990 crop 
season it generally denies program benefits if farmers harvest 
crops other than the program crop for which they have a base 
acreage 
a change in the strict rules is being sought by the 
administration and many farm groups and members of congress 
the american farm bureau federation favors acreage flexibility 
with a couple of stipulations of its own and the national farmers 
union which is often at odds with the administration on farm 
policy also likes the idea but wants to study the fine print on 
the administrations plan 
yeutter explained the administrations version of flexibility at 
a news conference its not exactly a new idea he said 
heres how it might work 
each farm is assigned a normal crop acreage or nca which is 
the total acreage bases of program crops such as wheat feed 
grains upland and extralong staple cotton plus a farms 
historical plantings of oilseeds soybeans sunflowers and 
rapeseed including canola 
as it does now the usda would determine each year whether to 
apply individual crop acreage reduction programs called arps 
if necessary to each crops base acreage if so a percentage of 
the farms base with the exception of oilseed acres must be 
idled as an acreage conservation reserve or acr 
to qualify for price supports and other program benefits the 
farmer must comply with the arp requirement for that crop in 
addition the sum of all ncacrop plantings plus land idled under 
the acreage reduction programs cannot exceed the nca for the 
individual farm 
in return the farmer is allowed some flexibility without losing 
benefits or suffering penalties on the farms acreage base 
were proposing that we would establish arps acreage 
reduction programs on a cropbycrop basis just as we do now 
yeutter said in other words therell be a wheat arp and a corn 
or a feed grains arp and a rice arp whatever it may be 
basically on the rest of the acreage the farmer will be able 
to grow any of the socalled program crops plus any of the oilseed 
crops he said 
its really what i would call a modified nca program as 
the nca existed back in the 70s or thereabouts yeutter said 
in an example a 300acre farm included a 100acre wheat base a 
100acre corn base and 100 acres of soybeans the mythical wheat 
program included a 5 percent arp and the corn program a 10 percent 
arp 
that means the farmer has to pull out 5 acres of land for his 
wheat arp 10 acres for his corn arp and then under present law 
that means hell plant 95 acres of wheat and hell plant 90 acres 
of corn yeutter said and then on the other 100 acres hell 
grow soybeans or whatever 
shifting to the simplest example of flexibility as proposed 
in the administration plan yeutter said the arps would be the same 
five acres of wheat and 10 acres of corn 
but on the remaining 285 acres yeutter said the farmer would be 
allowed to grow wheat corn any of the oilseeds rice cotton or 
whatever 
and he can plant that in any proportions he wishes yeutter 
said if he wants to plant it all to wheat he can plant it all 
to wheat if he wants to plant it all to corn he can plant it all 
to corn 
yeutter described several variations of the plan in which the 
300acre farmer could plant certain crops on his setaside acres 
provided his acres eligible for payments are reduced accordingly 
oilseeds and experimental crops such as kenaf used for newsprint 
are among the options under the flexibility plan he said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says the 
nations environment would benefit if planting rules in the 
governments commodity programs were made more flexible 
by requiring only basic cropland setasides under a normal 
crop acreage arrangement farmers generally would be free to 
plant whatever they choose on the remaining acreage without 
penalties yeutter said tuesday 
yeutter said the flexibility plan would permit crop rotations 
or facilitate and foster crop rotations which are very difficult to 
carry out under current more rigid farm program regulations 
the rigidities that exist today discourage the kinds of 
rotation practices that were often followed in past year he 
said one pays a very significant price in shifting from one 
program crop to another today because it affects deficiency 
payments subsidies 
yeutter added under this program those kinds of shifts can 
be undertaken much more readily and it would not be difficult under 
our flexibility provisions to carry out the kind of rotation 
multiyear rotation that is often suggested by people who are 
engaging in lowinput sustainable agricultural research

a hearing on a proposal to close an exhibit 
of skeletal remains of prehistoric indians at a museum turned into 
a noisy display of emotions among opposing factions tuesday 
indians in headgear beads and feathers showed up from half a 
dozen states to urge that the display be closed 
their bodies need to be reburied to let their spirits continue 
on their journey said jerry bear shield of wounded knee sd 
one indian punctuated the hearing with drum beats when speakers 
said things he liked 
others among the 400 people in attendance repeatedly shouted and 
applauded through the hearing 
state rep david leitch of peoria said he objected to closing 
the exhibit at the dickson mounds museum 
were not talking about a peepshow here he told the crowd 
these remains cant be traced to any existing tribe or group of 
people each of us can share in their history and culture 
michael haney of seminole okla said he came to the hearing 
with petitions signed by 250000 indians from 26 tribes opposing 
the exhibit 
we demand that the remains of our ancestors be taken off 
display he said haney threatened to set up picket lines at the 
museum if the exhibit is not closed on the proposed date of feb 15 
the hearing was held to gauge grassroots reaction to the 
decision by gov james r thompsons administration to close the 
site 
the illinois department of energy and natural resources which 
runs the museum announced plans last month to close the exhibit 
citing growing sensitivity to the public display of human remains 
similar exhibits in kansas alabama and kentucky have been 
closed or will be shut down in deference to american indian groups 
who objected to the displays 
the exhibit of exposed graves in an excavated indian burial 
ground is the centerpiece of the dickson mounds museum near 
lewistown 35 miles southwest of peoria 
the museum one of the only ancient indian burial plots open to 
public view attracts about 80000 visitors each year 
when the natural resources agency decided to close the exhibit 
effective feb 1 with thompsons approval there was an outcry 
from lawmakers who contended the move would cripple the museums 
drawing power and educational value 
the state house of representatives approved a nonbinding 
resolution that opposed closing the exhibit and called for public 
hearings on the proposal 
the hearing and original closing date were postponed by a 
snowstorm in late january 
attorney general neil hartigan a candidate for the democratic 
nomination for governor has criticized thompson for agreeing to 
close the museum complaining that illinois children should not be 
denied access to their past 
spokesmen for the governor have labeled hartigan a political 
opportunist and questioned his sincerity 
the museum was opened in 1927 after an amateur archeologist don 
dickson unearthed the remains of 237 people who lived in the 
illinois river valley 800 to 1000 years ago 
it was privately operated until 1945 when it was purchased by 
the state and turned into a public museum

the bush administrations proposed 14 million 
cut in a jobs program for elderly americans will prevent 10000 
needy senior citizens from receiving help a senate chairman says 
sen tom harkin diowa who heads the senate appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees funding for the labor department 
complained tuesday of the agencys plan to scale back the jobs 
program 
labor secretary elizabeth dole who testified on the 
departments 263 billion budget said the administration chose to 
cut the program because of the nations tight financial situation 
under the program older citizens are placed in community 
service jobs such as in hospitals schools and libraries the jobs 
usually pay minimum wage 
its a great employment opportunity that keeps elderly 
americans off welfare and gives them some respect some dignity 
harkin said this is one cut that just does not make sense 
president bushs budget proposes 343 million be spent on the 
program in the 1991 budget year it got 357 million in the current 
fiscal year 
its a result of the budget constraints i wish that it did 
not have to be so mrs dole said 
harkin noting the hourly minimum wage is set to increase from 
335 to 425 next year said the programs funding would also 
have to increase to employ the same number of americans in 1991 
he suggested funding be restored through the supplemental 
appropriations process to account for the minimum wage difference 
but mrs dole said that process should be reserved for dire 
emergencies 
dire emergency is in the eye of the beholder harkin said 
many participants in his home state had lost their farms and the 
community service jobs helped them through a period of time to 
something else 
on another issue mrs dole said the departments proposed 
2526 million increase for new youth job training programs would 
help an estimated 683000 of the nations most atrisk youth 
if were going to remain competitive in a global market we 
must address ourselves to this skills gap and a motivational gap 
that exists in many areas as well mrs dole said 
she said the department was working on ways to help high school 
students make the transition to the workforce since many students 
now get out of school and kick around for a couple of years 
trying to find the right spot 
many senators praised the labor secretary for her role in 
bringing about a tentative settlement in the pittstonunited mine 
workers strike but she again found herself explaining the 
governments handsoff approach at eastern air lines where 
machinists remain on strike 
i think you always have to go case by case mrs dole said 
citing different federal labor laws that govern the transportation 
industry she also said the airline strike was not causing an 
emergency in the travel industry 
this was not the kind of situation that would tie up 
transportation in a section of the country she said

law enforcement organizations are joining 
forces with gun control crusader sarah brady and religious and 
professional groups in urging quick senate action to ban specified 
semiautomatic assault weapons 
drug traffickers are increasingly utilizing assault weapons 
to assist and protect them in the selling of death and 
destruction baltimore police chief cornelius j behan firearms 
chairman of the international association of chiefs of police said 
tuesday 
behan and others appeared at a news conference with mrs brady 
whose husband former presidential press secretary james brady was 
wounded in an assassination attempt on former president reagan in 
1981 
this is the first time these fine groups have gathered 
together to speak out for sensible gun laws said mrs brady who 
heads handgun control inc but im angry that we have to be here 
at all 
she said backers of the legislation were told it would be 
considered by the senate this week but it now appeared it might be 
put off until after the february congressional recess congress is 
to recess friday for lincolns birthday and return feb 19 
the bill would impose a threeyear ban on the sale transport 
and possession of the semiautomatic weapons penalties include a 
mandatory 10 years in prison for use of a semiautomatic assault 
weapon in the commission of a drug trafficking or violent crime 
we cannot begin to curb crime and the epidemic of random 
violence which plagues our cities while we continue to legitimize 
the wholesale arming of ordinary citizens including the mentally 
defective and the street gangs said rabbi lynne landsberg 
assistant director of the religious action center of reform judaism 
the national rifle association opposes the bill saying the 
restrictions would apply to guns used for hunting 
but warren eisenberg director of the international council of 
bnai brith said his organization does not believe the bill would 
interfere with the legitimate activities of sportsmen 
in an age when hate criminals and narcoterrorists use assault 
weapons to commit their crimes it is ridiculous to try to defend 
certain categories of domestic and imported weapons as sporting 
equipment eisenberg said 
robert z alpern director of the washington office of the 
unitarian universalist association said the bill would be a 
small step toward limiting the supply of semiautomatic weapons that 
have taken an unconscionable toll of human lives and terrorized our 
nation 
assault weapons are a life and death issue to police 
officers said sgt william pattison of nassau county ny 
executive vice president of the national association of police 
organizations the police officers of this country are at war to 
reclaim our streets we must end the maiming and killing of our 
children our citizens and our police officers 
spokesmen for the american bar association american medical 
association and american federation of teachers aflcio also 
supported the bill

oliver norths lawyers say a linebyline 
review of testimony from every witness should have been made to 
ensure the former white house aides case was untainted by 
immunized congressional testimony 
defense attorney barry simon made the argument tuesday in urging 
a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals to overturn 
norths convictions in the irancontra scandal 
appeals judge patricia wald asked whether simon was urging that 
every line of testimony be scrutinized to determine whether its 
origin was independent of norths immunized statements in 1987 on 
national television 
we believe that is what it requires simon said of the 1972 
supreme court ruling declaring that prosecutors must show that none 
of their case comes from a defendants previously immunized 
testimony 
we would have gone through trial testimony line by line 
simon added 
simon also argued former president reagan should have been 
called as a witness at norths trial 
frankly i dont see how his testimony could not have been 
relevant said simon 
north was convicted may 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction 
of congress altering and destroying national security council 
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity 
norths defense to the first two convictions is that all his 
activities were authorized by his superiors including 
thennational security adviser john poindexter and reagan 
government attorney gerard lynch said norths own testimony at 
his trial was that he never met alone with reagan and that 
north never said the president told him to do anything 
but appeals judge laurence silberman said that even if reagan 
didnt give specific authorization the expresidents testimony 
could have been helpful to north 
suppose the expresident says that i never gave specific 
authorization but i did indicate that i didnt wish this 
information to be revealed said silberman 
during nearly 2 hours of arguments silberman also noted 
reagans written answers to questions in the irancontra affair 
were submitted to a grand jury but were never provided to norths 
lawyers 
why as a matter of basic fairness werent reagans answers 
turned over to north asked silberman 
lynch said the judgment was made that reagans written answers 
would not have been helpful to north 
but our system of justice said silberman is based on a 
defendant getting a wide latitude in obtaining information for his 
defense 
silberman said what troubles me is we dont have a very good 
idea of what the president would testify had he been called as a 
witness at norths trial indicating reagans stillsecret written 
answers in the irancontra scandal were general in nature 
if north had worked in the state department and reagan had been 
secretary of state reagan would certainly have been called to 
testify said silberman 
wald is a carter administration appointee silberman and david 
sentelle the third member of the panel that will decide norths 
appeal were appointed by reagan

the food and drug administration says it 
cannot bear the sole responsibility for ensuring the nations milk 
supply is safe from veterinary drugs that may be harmful to humans 
we know that traces of drug residues may sometimes be found in 
milk and that such trace levels are rarely of public health 
concern the fdas gerald b guest told a house panel tuesday 
while fda and the states must continue to play a larger role 
in solving this problem the responsibility for this situation is 
not totally a federal and state responsibility said guest head 
of the fdas center for veterinary medicine 
in fact a share of the burden for reducing illegal residues 
in milk falls clearly on the dairy farmer the veterinarian and the 
milk industry he told the house government operations 
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations 
but subcommittee chairman ted weiss dny said the honest 
answer is you just dont know the extent to which the milk supply 
is safe 
the hearing followed mondays release of an fda survey which 
purported to strike down the findings of private studies by the 
wall street journal and the center for science in the public 
interest a consumer group 
weiss challenged the methods used in the fda tests and 
questioned its reluctance to accept a relatively new screening test 
known as the charm ii that test was used in the two private 
surveys 
the test is highly sensitive able to show drug residues in 
amounts as low as five parts per billion advocates say 
but the fda said the test yields too many false positives and 
none of its positive findings could be validated in what it 
considered more accurate newer tests charm ii is also limited 
because it deals with only classes of drugs not individual ones 
fda says 
the fda said its follow tests for sulfa drugs eliminated all 
samples but the agency admitted its more advanced followup tests 
the final being mass spectrometry were far less sensitive to small 
amounts 
joseph settepani an fda scientist criticized the agency for 
failing to control extralabel drug use under which veterinarians 
may prescribe drugs under certain conditions for purposes other 
than those for which the drug was initially approved 
he said an internal memorandum in 1988 listed 30 drugs believed 
to be used by milk producers sixteen are used extensively he said 
many of these medicines are quite toxic but the bs disk assay 
test only has any likelihood of being able to detect residues in 
milk from 2 of the 30 drugs on the list he said 
the bs test which stands for bacillus stearothermophilus is 
the only fda standard test for state inspectors under the milk 
inspection program

the senate is embroiled in a dispute over 
whether 25 million should go to a private national board seeking 
to set higher standards for public school teachers 
arguments over such a federal role in teacher certification held 
up quick action tuesday on a 15 billion fiveyear program aimed 
at upgrading the quality of education in the united states 
sen jesse helms rnc sought unsuccessfully to strip the 
money from the national board for professional teaching standards 
but he promised to renew that fight today 
what this board wants is to be the sole voice of setting 
the standards by which teachers operate that only teachers and 
their unions should decide who can and who cannot teach he 
argued now i think thats an outrage 
sen strom thurmond dsc said the provision could set a 
precedent for federal funding of other private organizations could 
move this country to federal control of teaching standards he 
said 
but the senate defeated on a 6435 vote helms amendment to 
remove funds for the board from the education bill 
the board was created in 1987 at the urging of the national 
governors association it is an independent nonpartisan 
organization governed by a 64member board of directors including 
representatives of teachers unions activities so far have been 
lowkey 
tuesdays vote upholding funds for the board came after several 
senators said public education in the united states had fallen into 
disarray sen david boren chairman of the intelligence committee 
said declining educational standards pose the greatest national 
security threat to the united states 
supporters of the funding said the board with federal 
encouragement would lend badly needed prestige to the teaching 
profession 
they said it would give teachers the sort of professional 
competency reviews that doctors and lawyers get from the american 
medical association and american bar association teachers could 
voluntary submit for review by the national accreditation board 
backers of the provision said 
the proposal to authorize 25 million for the certification 
board is part of a wideranging education bill the congressional 
budget office says would likely cost close to 15 billion over 
five years 
the bill seeks to combat drugs in public schools establish a 
presidential merit schools program and increase aid to schools 
seeking to reduce dropout rates 
earlier tuesday the senate passed 990 legislation providing 
50 million in fiscal 1991 to attack illiteracy said to affect at 
least 23 million americans with a goal of eliminating illiteracy 
by the year 2000 
helms argued that the national board for professional teaching 
standards would be dominated by the national education association 
and the american federation of teachers 
the control of these unions over the board will enable them to 
use taxpayers money not so much to professionalize teachers as to 
finalize who does and does not teach in america he said 
sen trent lott rmiss said a vote against the bill was a 
vote for parents 
but sen edward m kennedy dmass charged opponents were 
using misinformation to defeat the provision supporters noted 
that none of the 25 million could be used to pay the boards 
operating expenses instead the money could be used only for 
research and development of teaching standards

a new government study shows drug treatments 
are slowing the rate of aids cases among homosexual men but that 
the new therapies arent reaching intravenous drug users and others 
among the poor 
the study shows about 36 percent fewer homosexual men have 
developed aids than had been projected by the public health 
service this rate began slowing around the middle of 1987 around 
the time the antiaids drug azt and other aids treatments came into 
wide use 
however the number of intravenous drug users developing aids is 
continuing upward along the same path as projected 
a good conjecture is they had less access since iv drug 
users tend to be poor and underserved by the health care system 
said mitchell h gail a national cancer institute epidemiologist 
who prepared the study with nci colleagues 
although we dont have good data yet its a reasonable guess 
that they are not being treated as intensively as they should be 
gail said 
the study is to be published in the march issue of the journal 
of aids 
aids can take years to develop after a person has been infected 
with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
the study confirms early treatment with azt and drugs such as 
aerosol pentamidine which treats opportunistic infections that can 
kill aids patients can slow progression of the disease 
this is a significant report since it provides independent 
evidence that early intervention and treatment for people with hiv 
infection slows progression of their disease dr james mason 
assistant secretary for health at the department of health and 
human services said in a statement 
he added i am delighted that treatment programs are 
effective but he said it is extremely important to remember 
that this good news is not a substitute for sustained behavior 
choices and effective prevention efforts by all people who are at 
risk 
gail said the numbers show that although treatments may be 
slowing progress of the disease people infected with the virus 
will eventually get the disease no one is known to have recovered 
from aids 
we have to be prepared for this large pool of infected people 
to work their way to the more severely immune depressed and to an 
aids diagnosis unless we develop a cure he said so we cant 
be that sanguine we have to be alert that aids incidence is going 
to rise in the future 
the federal centers for disease control which tracks reported 
aids cases is reassessing its projections last month the agency 
said its estimates of the potential number of aids cases ranging 
from 1 million to 15 million may be too high 
the cdc now believes the number to be in the range of 700000 to 
14 million according to an hhs source who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity

four federal reserve bank presidents are 
supporting a congressional resolution calling for an inflation rate 
near zero within five years but warn it will require temporarily 
higher unemployment and slower economic growth 
there is absolutely no question that bringing the underlying 
inflation rate down from its current level of 45 percent to 
something like 1 or 15 percent will involve costs said e 
gerald corrigan president of the federal reserve bank of new york 
indeed i am very hardpressed to recall a single case where a 
significant reduction in inflation was accomplished in a major 
industrial country without relatively large costs he told the 
house banking subcommittee on monetary policy on tuesday 
over the last decade in both germany and the netherlands 
the european superstars on the inflation front the unemployment 
rate has been quite high by historic and international comparative 
standards he said 
nevertheless corrigan and the three other presidents endorsed a 
zero inflation resolution proposed by rep stephen l neal dnc 
chairman of the monetary policy subcommittee in the long run zero 
inflation will bring the greatest possible economic growth and 
lower interest rates they argued 
the nations monetary policy is set mainly by the federal open 
market committee which is composed of the sevenmember federal 
reserve board in washington and the presidents of the 12 regional 
federal reserve banks 
robert t parry president of the federal reserve bank of san 
francisco said work done by his staff indicates that in the short 
term slower growth and higher unemployment but not an outright 
recession are necessary to bring inflation down to zero by 1994 
the unemployment rate now at 53 percent could rise to between 
675 percent and 775 percent he said at the same time growth 
as measured by the gross national product would have to be 1 to 2 
percentage points slower than the 25 percent to 3 percent growth 
that the bank presidents said was the fastest achievable without 
accelerating inflation 
congress and the administration can ease the pain by cutting the 
budget deficit and stimulating savings and investment corrigan 
said 
its going to take much more than rhetoric he said 
however neals resolution if passed would give the fed the 
political backing it needs to do its part said robert p black 
president of the federal reserve bank of richmond va 
inflation may well reaccelerate in the absence of a clear 
signal to the public that congress fully supports the federal 
reserves commitment to lower inflation he warned 
the federal reserve is under constant pressure to do 
something with monetary policy in the short run to improve the 
economys performance black said such pressures have at 
times actually contributed to an acceleration of inflation 
there is obviously a risk that history will repeat itself 
the fourth federal reserve bank president endorsing the 
resolution was h lee hoskins of cleveland 
in recent weeks the bush administration with no noticeable 
effect has called on the fed to lower interest rates and stimulate 
economic growth 
michael boskin chairman of the white house council of economic 
advisers told reporters tuesday that the administration supports 
reducing inflation over time but not necessarily within the 
timetable required by neals resolution 
our primary goal is to sustain the highest possible growth in 
the course of obtaining a sensible monetary policy we think it is 
desirable to maintain growth and employment boskin said

congressional democrats are raising images of 
democratic reforms in eastern europe and the us civil rights 
movement to pressure president bush into backing a housepassed 
bill easing voter registration 
over the objections of the white house and some other top 
republicans the house approved the legislation 289132 on tuesday 
and sent the measure to the senate sixtyone of the chambers 175 
republicans broke with party leaders to vote for the proposal 
the socalled motor voter bill requires states to include voting 
registration forms with drivers license applications and to 
establish procedures to sign up voters by mail and at numerous 
government offices it would take effect in january 1993 
states would have to search voting lists at least once every 
four years for people who have moved or have registered 
fraudulently the federal government would provide up to 50 
million to help states pay for the new procedures 
the white house complained last week that the measure written 
by reps al swift dwash and william thomas rcalif would 
allow too much fraud and be too expensive for states democrats 
spent much of tuesday attempting to capitalize on the 
administrations opposition 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo noted the bill 
was being debated at the very time the leaders of eastern europe 
are trying to bring democracy to their countries 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters democrats 
and republicans are proud and happy about the political reforms 
under way in eastern europe if president bush opposes improvements 
at home he said i would be interested in knowing why 
even democratic party chairman ronald h brown got into the act 
telling reporters as the iron curtain falls abroad we must open 
fully the voting curtain here at home 
other democrats drew connections between the legislation and the 
american civil rights movement 
arguing the bill would be the broadest extension of voting 
rights since the 1965 voting rights act rep john lewis dga a 
1960s civil rights activist said we should not be afraid to 
open fully the doors of political participation and let the people 
come in 
the legislators rejected by a 291129 vote a white housebacked 
alternative introduced by rep pat roberts rkan the measure 
would have made the bills new procedures voluntary and provided 
120 million to help states boost their voter registration efforts 
our campaigns are too long theyre too expensive they 
alienate potential voters said house minority leader bob michel 
rill if you want more people to vote then we should run more 
stimulating and competitive campaigns 
swift argued the gop amendment would gut the underlying bill 
the bill is aimed at dwindling voter turnout which dipped to 50 
percent of the 120 million registered voters in the 1988 
presidential polling experts say about 60 million americans who 
are eligible to vote are not registered 
advocates of the measure believe the motor voter section 
would be particularly effective because 91 percent of the 180 
million votingage americans have drivers licenses or motor 
vehicle department identification cards 
the legislation would apply to every state but north dakota 
which does not require voters to register

for about 5 you can get a room at 
saalfelds best hotel cheap but you might not be pleased by the 
failing furnace sagging floors and a bed that remains unmade 
unless you do it yourself 
east germany is just like this hotel remarked a worker at 
the hotel anker who said he would be fired if his name was 
published 
the whole place is falling apart and no one in their right 
mind would want to stay here 
east germany seems like it is crumbling 
despair at economic conditions and uncertainty about east 
germanys future an exodus of workers to west germany strikes 
and absenteeism are bringing the country to the brink of collapse 
east germany is also suffering a political paralysis stemming 
from a leadership vacuum and constant bickering among opposition 
forces 
this country is in serious trouble and theres not a lot of 
agreement about what to do about it said guenter bader a member 
of the new forum opposition group in saalfeld a town of about 
30000 people near the bavarian border 
karl gruenheid head of a government economics committee said 
in east berlin that the shortage of workers and strikes are 
seriously driving down production 
mail is no longer delivered in some areas because theres no one 
to deliver it 
soldiers are being used to operate trolleys because of a driver 
shortage 
production at a giant potash mine near erfurt was paralyzed by 
striking workers demanding more pay and assurances they wont lose 
their jobs as east germany goes through the painful process of 
adopting freemarket principles 
production slowdowns are starting to create serious shortages 
of some key products such as rolled steel coal and natural gas 
west german news media report 
at least onetenth of saalfelds citizens have fled to west 
germany and the number grows every day bader said 
if something isnt done soon saalfeld will be nothing but an 
old folks home with a few jobless stasi state security agents 
left behind he said 
west german companies have plans to help bail out east germanys 
economy as the two countries gradually move toward reunification 
but the rescue operation will cost billions and take years 
east germany once had one of the strongest economies in the east 
bloc but an exodus of more than 400000 people in little more than 
a year and rising despair among the people have steered the economy 
to the edge of disaster 
financial experts say east germany has many assets on which to 
build a thriving economy 
but over 40 years the communists did little maintenance on 
plants and factories and a total overhaul may be needed to make 
them profitable 
experts say tourism could also become an important moneymaker in 
east germany but enormous and costly renewal efforts would be 
needed 
saalfeld for example sits on the edge of the picturesque 
thuringian forest and would probably draw tourists with the right 
accommodations and entertainment possibilities 
but like most smalltown hotels across east germany the main 
one in saalfeld the anker has standards most westerners would 
not tolerate 
the hotel furnace failed on at least two recent cold february 
nights the maid showed up only to announce it was time for the 
guest to leave and noxious coal fumes filtered into the room from 
someone elses furnace 
whenever west german businessmen think about our countrys 
economy what they see is a place where a lot of money has to be 
invested this hotel for example would have to be totally 
rebuilt its an embarrassment said a hotel employee 
during a rally in saalfeld new forum speakers promised they 
would work for the preservation of local jobs if residents sent 
their candidate to parliament in march 18 elections 
but the 500 or so rally participants were less interested in the 
elections than they were in calling for unity with west germany 
east germanys leaders have finally had to swallow the idea that 
german unification is inevitable but they want it to come from a 
gradual process 
communist premier hans modrow has pleaded for workers to stay on 
the job and for citizens to remain in east germany saying the 
country has to work out its problems in an orderly manner 
above all i call on the citizens to abstain from anything 
and i mean anything that damages our economy and assistance 
for and welfare of the people modrow told parliament

the head of the equal employment opportunity 
commission has one less roadblock toward confirmation as a federal 
appeals judge with a major civil rights groups promise not to 
stand in his way 
while we cannot give him our unqualified endorsement we will 
however not oppose the nomination naacp executive director 
benjamin l hooks said tuesday 
the statement was issued as the senate judiciary committee heard 
testimony on the nomination of clarence thomas a prominent black 
conservative in the reagan and bush administrations 
civil rights forces over the last seven years have continuously 
criticized the 41yearold yale law graduate and former aide to 
sen john c danforth rmo they say he has been lax in enforcing 
antibias laws 
it appeared the nomination of thomas to succeed robert bork on 
the us court of appeals in the district of columbia could become 
the first skirmish this year between the bush administration and 
liberals over judicial nominees 
but there didnt appear at the hearing to be enough opposition 
in the senate to block the nomination with the naacp standing 
aside in his brief statement hooks said we do have questions 
about his management of eeoc 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio a member of the panel said 
frankly i have questions about the nominees commitment to the 
law but he told thomas we havent always agreed but i 
respect your views 
nancy kreiter of chicago research director of the women 
employed institute testified that under thomas the commission 
failed to fulfill its mandate to protect the rights of victims of 
discrimination 
mr thomas actions in the areas of policy and enforcement 
performance demonstrate a lack of respect for law and a disregard 
for individuals she said arguing people who file complaints 
have been treated with increasing hostility 
a careful look at his record raises serious questions about 
his qualifications for a lifetime appointment to administer justice 
on the federal bench she said 
rutgers law professor alfred w blumrose an advocate of rights 
for senior citizens told the committee the commission apparently 
violated its own regulations by eliminating a policy of pursuing 
hiring goals and timetables in 1985 without taking any formal 
action under the federal governments sunshine law 
he said there was a sort of quiet suggestion by innuendo 
leading the lawyers in the agency to alter the process 
thomas testified that as an appeals judge he would not have 
the option of roaming unfettered through judicial terrain and 
injecting his personal views into decisions 
thomas vowed to faithfully adhere to the supreme court 
decisions and not torture a case to reach a preconceived notion 
of what a result should be 
he acknowledged the statute of limitations on 900 cases of 
alleged bias against the elderly lapsed before the commission acted 
on them it happened on my watch he said but he said the 
lapses were because he initiated more extensive investigative 
procedures that may have been too ambitious 
sen howell heflin dala asked him about reports that 13000 
cases actually lapsed thomas said i dont have the slightest 
idea where that number comes from 
thomas who is black said as a conservative he often finds 
himself at odds with an expected orthodoxy from black 
americans he said criticism from civil rights groups is 
something that is uncomfortable but it is something that ill have 
to live with 
i think the choice between principle and popularity is 
something that each individual will have to make and ive made mine 
and ill live with the consequences thomas said 
danforth who twice hired thomas as an aide praised him as a 
person who calls them as he sees them

senate negotiators on clean air legislation 
are working toward a compromise on curbing auto emissions now that 
sources say they reached a tentative agreement to limit toxic 
industrial releases 
i hope we can conclude the discussions this week said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine in a telephone 
interview tuesday night after daylong closeddoor bargaining on key 
parts of the clean air bill 
the legislation which would require tighter pollution controls 
on everything from automobiles to industrial facilities and 
electric power plants would be the first tightening of federal 
clean air law in 13 years 
a subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
planned to begin considering that chambers clean air bill today 
mitchell said several proposals on auto emissions were being 
considered and that he hoped that issue could be resolved by the 
end of today 
according to senate sources negotiators reached a tentative 
agreement that would require industry to use the best available 
technology to curb toxic chemical releases and eventually meet 
specific health standards based on cancer risk 
industry and the bush administration had opposed the healthrisk 
criteria arguing it would be too expensive and some plants would 
be unable to comply but the compromise would make it easier for 
certain plants to avoid the most stringent healthbased standards 
because the government would have to calculate risks using real 
world situations at specific plants and not rely on mathematical 
models 
sources said the negotiators also reached agreement on urban 
smog pollution from sources other than motor vehicles the 
compromise however exempts most smaller polluters which 
complained that they might be driven out of business if required to 
install pollution control equipment 
the negotiations have involved a relatively small number of 
senators and senior bush administration officials including epa 
administrator william reilly his deputy for air pollution issues 
william rosenberg and roger porter a senior presidential adviser 
regular participants have been mitchell sen bob dole rkan 
the minority leader and sens max baucus dmont and john 
chafee rri the bills two floor leaders as well as other 
senators with interest about specific parts of the bill according 
to senate sources 
the talks are aimed at heading off a floor fight on the clean 
air bill which mitchell has made a target for early action 
negotiators on tuesday narrowed the discussions on auto 
emissions to a small number of proposals including a compromise 
reached between mitchell and sen carl levin dmich who had 
championed the concerns of the automakers 
but the mitchelllevin proposal was not endorsed by the bush 
administration and both baucus and chafee also were said to have 
reservations about it 
the mitchelllevin proposal would retain tough secondstage 
tailpipe standards scheduled to go into effect in the year 2003 
but eliminate a requirement for automakers to sharply increase fuel 
economy through mandated reductions in carbon dioxide emissions 
the carbon dioxide reductions have been strongly opposed by 
automakers who maintain they are not feasible while being pushed 
by environmentalists as a way to deal with global warming 
meanwhile some senators not directly participating were said to 
be privately expressing some concern about the closeddoor deal 
making 
even baucus suggested some discomfort tuesday saying he wants 
to make sure that all that has been written into the bill in 
public is not unwritten in these closed sessions

placed aboard pan am flight 103 in frankfurt before it took off for 
london passengers and luggage were transferred to a boeing 747 at 
londons heathrow airport for the transatlantic leg of the trip to 
new york city

aboard a plane from malta investigators found clothing fragments 
in lockerbie that were traced to a clothing store in malta 
according to a federal law enforcement source 
the bombing investigation has focused on a number of terrorist 
organizations including the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
polygraph tests cannot be admitted in court but the questions 
keefe asked the baggage handlers and their responses may provide 
investigators with new leads in the case 
keefe works for interfor inc a new yorkbased security 
consulting firm retained by lawyers representing pan ams insurance 
carrier in a 300 million damage suit filed by relatives of people 
killed in the bombing

the defense department is no longer planning 
for largescale resistance to a soviet attack through iran toward 
persian gulf oil fields according to published reports today 
the instructions are contained in the annual defense planning 
guidance this year covering the period 19921997 and signed by 
defense secretary dick cheney on jan 24 according to the 
washington post 
the newspaper said a senior defense department official briefed 
several reporters about the document which is classified 
the new york times today carried a similar description of the 
contents of the document attributed to a senior defense official 
a pentagon spokesman col steve roy said tuesday night he had 
no information on the guidance document 
the united states has had contingency plans to counter a soviet 
attack into iran since the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 
central command based in tampa fla was established to handle 
the planning and to direct any military operations in the persian 
gulf area this command handled the navy patrols of the gulf and 
escorts of kuwaiti tankers under the us flag in 1987 against 
iranian attacks naval activity drastically curtailed after the end 
of the iraniraq war 
according to the times the senior official said the threat of a 
soviet drive through iran was now not credible and the united 
states was not capable of mounting a defense in irans zagros 
mountains 
according to the post the united states would still consider 
the contingency of the soviet attack into iran but no longer make 
the large investments to support forces in iran according to 
the senior official 
according to both newspapers the guidance document instructs 
planners to assume a successful negotiation on conventional forces 
in europe will cut soviet forces there 
both said the services were told to plan to defend the oil 
fields of the arabian peninsula against attacks by unspecified 
adversaries

relatives say they listened helplessly to 
screams for help but were kept back by intense heat as a young 
couple and four children died in a fire that destroyed their mobile 
home 
a woodburning stove that had been moved and reinstalled in the 
mobile home just a day earlier caused the fire 
killed in tuedays predawn fire were davie light 18 michelle 
miller 22 their 3weekold daughter jessica millers two other 
children james 3 and alicia 16 months and lights niece 
rachel hafley 3 
i ran over and i could hear davie yelling and banging trying 
to get out said jim wills lights brotherinlaw i tried to 
yank the back door open but when i finally did it was too late 
the flames blocked the door he said trapping the occupants 
its an awful thing when you hear someone hollering for 
help wills said and you cant do nothing 
investigators said the fire started in an improperly installed 
flue attached to the wood stove 
apparently the flue pipe was a couple of inches too short 
where it ran through the ceiling said washington county sheriff 
ronnie l skiles the stove had also been mounted on wooden 
blocks 
robert jacobsen of the state division of fire safety said the 
fire probably had smoldered for some time before bursting into 
flames and that the residents probably could have gotten out had 
the trailer been equipped with a smoke detector 
skiles said wood stoves were becoming more prevalent in trailers 
in the area 65 miles southwest of st louis 
people cant afford gas they cant afford electricity 
especially in a financially depressed area like washington county 
they do it to save money he said 
skiles said although fire codes dont forbid it a mobile home 
is not made for a wood stove

a 156yearold painting of a mountain 
by the founder of the hudson river school apparently shows the 
highest peak in the berkshires not a new york slope as was long 
thought 
some art historian sleuthing has revealed that what was accepted 
as a scene near the hudson river studio of 19th century landscape 
artist thomas cole actually is mount greylock of massachusetts 
the 1834 painting had been identified in the 1950s as a scene 
near mount merino in hudson ny across the river from catskill 
ny where cole maintained a studio 
maureen johnson hickey curator of art education for the 
berkshire museum in pittsfield said her curiosity was piqued when 
she began assembling an exhibit of hudson river school painters 
scenes of the berkshires to open in march 
all the biggies cole church duran innes came to the 
berkshires and i just couldnt believe that cole living so close 
had never painted anything here she said 
ellwood c parry iii a professor of art history at the 
university of arizona said cole was in pittsfield in 1833 and had 
mentioned doing a portrait of hoosac mountain as greylock was then 
called 
at parrys suggestion a painting acquired two years ago by the 
newark museum in newark nj was examined and found to depict 
lake pontoosuc and mount greylock rising 3491 feet from a 
sealevel valley in the northern berkshires instead of the gentler 
rise along the hudson river 
although the lake is larger now a grove of pines at the right 
of the painting still stands and the white church steeple and 
little village of lanesboro can be seen in the distance just as 
they appear in the painting ms hickey said

some asked about former president reagans 
boyhood habit of hiding pennies others fixated on the football in 
his bedroom and just about everyone liked his birthday cake 
by all accounts the birthday party for 250 fifth graders at 
reagans boyhood home was a success even though reagan was not on 
hand to have a piece of the birthday cake 
in honor of his 79th birthday youngsters from the school system 
toured the reagan home and visitors center on tuesday and saw a 
video about his life 
fifth graders were selected for the party because reagan was 
about that age when he began school in dixon after moving with his 
family to the northern illinois town from his hometown of tampico 
about 20 miles southwest 
the dixon city council and the illinois general assembly marked 
the event by declaring tuesday ronald reagan day the birthday 
party for fifth graders may become an annual event

the school board reinstated a black 
superintendent and closed the schools today to ease racial turmoil 
that raised discordant echoes from this 1960s battleground of the 
civil rights movement 
with the 25th anniversary of the selmatomontgomery voting 
rights march only a month away white officials appeared close to 
bowing to the key demands of black protesters 
the six white members of the selma board of education reinstated 
the citys first black school superintendent norward roussell and 
urged the five black board members who had quit over roussells 
treatment to return 
roussell said he was not surprised by his reinstatement saying 
he did not understand the boards decision to relieve me of my 
duties 
the board closed all 11 schools in the 6000student system 
which is 70 percent black they will not reopen until racial 
tensions subside and the threat of schoolhouse violence ends the 
board said 
the boards decision late tuesday capped weeks of protests and 
periodic school boycotts 
selma is a magic name for demonstrations said mayor joe 
smitherman who has served all but one term as mayor since 1964 
this is almost like a beginning of a reenactment of the 60s a 
real reenactment 
i hope it doesnt get to that he said 
the five black school board members quit in december after the 
board in a vote split along racial lines decided not to renew 
roussells 80000ayear contract in june supporters claimed 
roussell was removed because of race and not because of a lack of 
managerial skills as his detractors said 
last week the white members of the board voted to remove 
roussell immediately and installed the rev fd reese the black 
principal of selma high school as interim superintendent 
the decision to reinstate roussell meant reese would lose his 
new job but reese said he accepted the decision 
reese called for the orderly dismissal of classes tuesday after 
reports of fighting at 1508student selma high the systems only 
public high school which is about twothirds black 
we could certainly see and feel the level of tensions among 
the students reese said police were called but there were no 
arrests 
dozens of the black students joined in demonstrations outside 
city hall carrying signs saying smitherman must go and 
singing civil rights songs 
on monday four black protesters were arrested on misdemeanor 
charges in a melee in the mayors office 
one of the four rose sanders was taken to a hospital with an 
apparent neck or back injury and was listed in stable condition 
her husband state sen hank sanders a democrat said she was in 
pain but indicated the injury was not critical 
the five black board members said they never signed formal 
resignation papers leaving open the possibility of their return 
a statement by the board said selma schools would reopen upon 
adequate assurances to dr roussell and the board that the safety 
and physical welfare of our students and all school employees can 
be ensured 
roussell was at selma high as throngs of parents and students 
left the building with the cancellation of classes tuesday morning 
he joined in helping disperse crowds of students so we would not 
have any trouble 
roussell who became superintendent in 1987 said he was not 
legally removed from office by the board and was officially on 
vacation during recent weeks 
in sanctioning his removal white school board members had cited 
an unfavorable job evaluation and roussells management style

the internal revenue service is putting out 
guidelines to help charities determine how much of a contribution 
is taxdeductible when the donor receives something in return 
the irs also asked charitable organizations to determine 
beforehand the fair market value of any benefit given to a 
contributor any solicitation ticket or receipt should state how 
much of the contribution is deductible 
although the law allows a tax deduction for most contributions 
to charities recognized by the irs it generally requires that any 
goods or services of value received in return be subtracted from 
the deductible amount 
in the new guidelines issued tuesday the agency acknowledged 
that some gifts to the donor may be so insubstantial that the 
entire contribution is deductible 
in general the insubstantial rule will come into play when 
the value of all benefits received by a donor is not more than 2 
percent of the contribution or 50 whichever is less or if the 
contribution is 2726 or more and the only benefits are token 
items such as tshirts bookmarks or calendars bearing the 
charitys name the cost of the article may not exceed 545 
the latter two figures represent the inflationadjusted value of 
25 and 5 respectively which were the limitations when congress 
amended the law affecting deductible contributions

pap smear screening to detect cervical cancer 
combined with appropriate treatment could save the lives of many 
elderly women according to a new study by the office of technology 
assessment 
medicare the federal health care program for the elderly will 
begin paying for pap tests in july 1990 and the study by the 
congressional agency said the screening will be most costeffective 
it is combined with efforts to encourage highrisk women to be 
tested 
according to the study 
women at high risk of cervical cancer are smokers poor 
nonwhite were young at first intercourse and have had multiple 
sexual partners 
studies have found that women who have been screened are 
onehalf to onetenth as likely to develop cervical cancer as other 
women 
elderly women appear to have lower rates of localized 
noninvasive cervical tumors than younger women but the elderly 
have higher rates of invasive cervical cancer and higher death 
rates from cervical cancer 
since elderly women are less likely to be screened for cervical 
cancer than younger women older women are more likely to be in 
advanced stages of the disease when it is diagnosed

governments in west germany the netherlands 
and japan are unwilling to control the export of chemicals used to 
manufacture drugs says a bush administration official 
it does not seem likely that european chemical legislation as 
contemplated will have a significant impact on the diversion and 
trafficking of chemicals particularly those destined for the 
illicit production of cocaine said gene r haislip deputy 
assistant administrator of the drug enforcement administration 
haislip testifying before the subcommittee on foreign commerce 
of the senate commerce committee said great quantities of 
chemicals are shipped through the dutch port of rotterdam 
whereas in the past most of these shipments have come from the 
united states i think the shift is on and in the future were 
going to see that europe and to some lesser extent brazil and 
other countries will become the predominant suppliers with the 
netherlands and the federal republic of germany being the two 
principal exporting countries he said 
in an interview after his testimony haislip said the west 
german and dutch governments are reluctant to interfere with what 
they see as legitimate business 
at the hearing sens harry reid and richard bryan both nevada 
democrats accused us chemical companies of selling chemicals 
that help make drugs in colombia 
the evidence is inescapable that some american chemical 
manufacturers and distributors have contributed to americas 100 
billion cocaine habit said bryan

communist party leaders added an unexpected third 
day to their pivotal meeting tuesday and sent mikhail s gorbachev 
back to the drawing board to fill in holes in his blueprint for 
ending the partys monopoly on power 
the extension of the party session which was supposed to end 
tuesday was a clear sign of the controversy generated by 
gorbachevs proposals to revamp the countrys political structure 
it sharply contrasted with previous sessions when the central 
committee automatically approved policies that had been worked out 
at higher levels 
central committee sources said most speakers agreed with 
gorbachevs proposal that the partys monopoly on power enshrined 
in the soviet constitution must end 
all unanimously think it has become obsolete it has no 
meaning central committee member vladimir p anishchev told 
reporters who gathered outside the kremlins spasky gate to await 
news the session was closed to journalists 
however partial transcripts of two days of the session in 
which 51 speakers took the floor indicated that neither radical 
reformers nor hardliners were satisfied with gorbachevs proposal 
delegates said tuesday nights central committee session was 
suspended so a commission headed by gorbachev could complete 
changes to his nearly 20page platform a central committee source 
quoted gorbachev as saying that the 60member commission was only 
halffinished even though it met all night monday 
the meeting resumed wednesday morning 
delegates interviewed monday and tuesday as they filed out onto 
red square indicated a common objection the platform contains few 
specifics 
a lot of its points and this is what has been said by many 
speakers need major changes and reinforcement especially in the 
direction of stepping up decisive action leonid a bibin a 
nonvoting central committee member said in a soviet tv interview 
tuesday 
bibin said he and others want the platform to stress that the 
party must remain united the partys unity has been threatened in 
recent months by a breakaway of the party in lithuania and by 
proposals by moscow radicals for formal factions 
gorbachev as he has done on so many issues has placed himself 
in the middle trying to forge compromises 
still the soviet leaders platform has yielded to the demands 
of political reformers including the thousands of people who 
gathered near the kremlin wall sunday by removing the partys 
monopoly and advancing to this summer a party congress that will be 
empowered to clear out conservatives on the central committee 
gorbachev is not likely to water down the platform for fear of 
displeasing the increasingly active and consolidated reformers but 
he also must be careful not to antagonize conservatives who remain 
strong in the central committee 
formally the central committee has the power to replace the 
party leader 
indrek toome premier of the baltic republic of estonia and a 
guest at the party meeting emphasized the threat from hardliners 
i am worried about the wish of a fairly large proportion of 
the people in this hall to reverse things so as to clamp down on 
things and return to the old order toome told soviet tv 
other speakers worried out loud about gorbachevs political 
standing ya gankovsky a siberian party secretary suggested 
gorbachevs position was weakened because he had taken on too many 
jobs 
while you mikhail sergeyevich were only the party general 
secretary absolutely without flattery i will say we felt that 
new ideas were born in the party that some kind of reformation 
work was under way to break up the outlived and outdated now you 
have four posts one gets the impression that someone wants the 
general not to be successful at any of them scattering powers 
gankovsky said 
in addition to being party general secretary gorbachev is 
president chairman of the defense council and a politburo member 
politburo member yegor k ligachev widely identified as its 
leading conservative received warm applause for a speech 
criticizing failings in perestroika gorbachevs reform program 
the central committee source said 
after somewhat of an enlivening in the first two years of 
perestroika the economy began to decline interethnic feuds 
reached bloodshed people began to experience fear and in some 
places there is practically dual power ligachev said in remarks 
reported by tass 
he said the politburo led by gorbachev and the government 
committed serious oversights and mistakes he cited monetary 
problems that worsened consumer goods shortages a lack of 
supervision of new economic forms and a weakness of governent 
discipline 
the gap between the word and deed is intolerable he 
continued 
on political reform ligachev demanded the platform include a 
clause emphasizing the sacredness of party unity and he said he 
firmly opposes allowing private property a demand of radical 
reformers 
ligachev 69 has generally taken a cautious approach to 
reforming the country and last week came under attack in a soviet 
newspaper for his conservative views but in his speech tuesday he 
said he wants reform quickly denied he was a conservative and 
said people who call him one are trying to divert the peoples 
attention 
alexander fomin a coal miner invited as a guest to the session 
said other speakers criticized the platform as being based on old 
dogmas 
there were not enough radical proposals to solve the partys 
problems fomin said 
he did not detail the objections and the soviet media carried 
few details of the session 
one speaker yevgeny p velikhov said the communist party would 
be better off if it split in two so it could compete more 
effectively in the new political structure 
he compared the parties he envisions to the democratic and 
republican parties in the united states the platforms of those 
parties velikhov said are difficult to distinguish from one 
another velikhovs remarks were reported by tass

a federal appeals court ruled that 
vestiges of segregation permeate mississippis public 
universities 15 years after a lawsuit was filed to change the 
system 
the 21 decision by a 5th us circuit court of appeals panel in 
new orleans overturned a lower court ruling in a lawsuit by blacks 
over policies at mississippis five historically white and three 
historically black universities 
the badge of inferiority that marks black institutions has not 
been removed judges irving goldberg and sam d johnson wrote in 
the decision released tuesday as such there remains in 
mississippis higher educational system vestiges of discrimination 
which distort the perceptions of black students 
unfortunately they wrote this case lingered loitered and 
lulled for more than a decade without adequate changes 
hours after the ruling state leaders of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people appealed to 
students and administrators of traditionally whitedominated 
schools to be more accepting of black students 
racism is americas number 1 problem this ruling about 
mississippi gives a true portrait of mississippi but in any other 
state the ruling could have been the same said state naacp 
president aaron henry 
he said whites had not worked as hard as blacks in the 
desegregation effort that began when a court ordered the university 
of mississippi to enroll james meredith its first black student 
in 1962 
the willingness of the black communities to adapt to their 
white presence is more than the whites are willing to accommodate 
blacks henry said 
in his dissent judge john duhe said mississippi had fulfilled 
its legal obligation to open its universities to all students 
regardless of race 
the majority relying on district and other circuit court 
decisions has imposed upon the state the same constitutional 
duty required for primary and secondary education where freedom of 
choice is unavailable and services are free of charge 
the state college board can ask the panel to reconsider the 
ruling or can request an opinion of the full 15member court 
board attorney bill goodman said he would withhold comment until 
after the ruling is reconsidered 
aubrey lucas president of university of southern mississippi 
said my first reaction was one of regret that we were unable to 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the courts some very significant 
progress has been made 
historically white southern mississippi delta state 
mississippi state mississippi university for women and the 
university of mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over 
historically black alcorn state jackson state and mississippi 
valley state universities the panel ruled 
vestiges of de jure segregation permeate the public university 
system of mississippi the majority decision said admissions 
policies the racial composition of the faculty and administration 
funding practices academic offerings and mission designations all 
perpetuate a stigma of inferiority 
more than 99 percent of the states 26953 white college 
students were enrolled in historically white institutions during 
the 198586 school year while 71 percent of 12826 black students 
were enrolled in historically black schools the court said 
mississippi spent an average 1351 in 1960 and 8516 in 1986 
per student enrolled at historically white institutions the 
average at historically black schools was 718 in 1960 and 6038 
in 1986 the court said 
the lawsuit was filed in 1975 by jake ayers of glen allen on 
behalf of his son jake ayers jr a high school student and 20 
other black students 
the elder ayers has died and his son now 32 moved to oklahoma 
after dropping out of junior college to join the air force his 
mother lillian ayers said she has another son who will graduate 
from high school this year 
hopefully he will benefit from the change mrs ayers said 
the court sent the case back to us district judge neal b 
biggers jr who had dismissed the lawsuit in 1987 declaring 
mississippis university system sufficiently desegregated 
the appeals panel called for the lower courts rehearing to 
include testimony from psychologists sociologists and other 
professionals 
windows must open to ventilate the courtroom with ideas from 
the winds of truth it said to this end testimony 
depositions crossexaminations and opinions can assist only then 
should the parties come forth with a definite plan for achieving 
desegregation

enrique bermudez was ousted as top contra military 
leader after weathering years of infighting and accusations of 
corruption human rights violations and close ties to the hated 
somoza regime in nicaragua 
a clandestine contra radio station announced bermudez ouster 
tuesday in a broadcast from central america military spokesman 
alejandro acevedo said in miami 
bermudezs position as chief of the military in northern 
nicaragua has been eliminated and rebel forces will be run by the 
rebels joint chiefs of staff headed by israel galeano acevedo 
said 
the move which came at a meeting monday was intended as a 
signal to nicaraguas leftist government acevedo said and did not 
represent a rejection of bermudez 
in a democracy military officers do not rule for life he 
said contrasting bermudezs departure with the continued military 
rule of ortega in nicaragua 
bermudez 57 long considered a hardliner has run the 
usbacked contra army in one post or another since it was formed 
monday the officers decided he would remain a military officer 
but with no current responsibilities the spokesman said 
just under 10000 contra soldiers and about 50000 family 
members are living in camps in honduras just north of the 
nicaraguan border 
galeano whose nom de guerre is commander franklin pledged in 
december to place his troops in defensive positions limit 
violence and support international observer groups in advance of 
nicaraguas elections feb 25 
the contra reorganization followed accusations by the sandinista 
government and some human rights organizations that contra troops 
under bermudezs command killed two nuns one a us citizen in an 
attack on a church vehicle in northern nicaragua last month 
the contras have strongly denied responsibility for the nuns 
deaths blaming sandinista troops for the attack 
bermudez also was accused in a lawsuit filed in miami last week 
of ordering his troops to torture and kill an american engineer 
benjamin linder who had been helping the sandinistas build a dam 
in nicaragua the contras say linder 27 of portland ore died 
in a firefight and was in uniform 
bermudez was the military attache in washington under the 
government of former dictator anastasio somoza debayle when the 
sandinistas overthrew the government in 1979 
he assumed the position of leader of the ussupported contra 
troops when the force was created by the reagan administration and 
accounts by former contras have reported him as being a favorite of 
the cia and the supply network set up by former white house aide 
oliver north 
despite the reports criticizing bermudez as too close to 
somozas national guard he outlasted other contra civilian and 
military leaders 
when he joined the sevenmember ruling directorate as military 
coordinator in july 1988 several commanders on the contras 
southern front quit in protest 
the directorate was abolished by military officers after it lost 
us funding last year

lynda beams doesnt care if geraldo rivera 
interviews men in lace panties topless donut shop operators or 
teenage satanic murder cultists just not in front of her kids 
please 
its softcore pornography says mrs beams 
she would like the show taken off the air but will settle for 
it being moved from an afterschool time slot 
its an adult talk show and it airs when most adults are at 
work and children are at home she said 
mrs beams heads a national grassroots movement against riveras 
program one of several such loose groupings that have arisen in 
recent years to battle objectionable tv shows 
last year a michigan woman terry rakolta persuaded three 
corporations to pull ads from fox networks married with 
children which rakolta complained was full of gratuitous sexual 
innuendo 
other companies withdrew advertising from saturday night 
live in response to complaints about an episode in which the word 
penis was repeatedly used 
many viewers are complaining about geraldo and some 
stations are listening 
rivera publicist jeff erdel said geraldo is being carried by 
199 stations in all but a few network tv markets up from 162 
stations a year ago but 25 percent of the stations have let rivera 
know theyre not happy with his show erdel said 
rivera and the shows producers have pledged a return to more 
substantive issues in an effort to win back sponsors and viewers 
but some stations are holding out on renewals 
we havent quite decided about geraldo said joe bell 
program director of kdfw in dallas which lost numerous sponsors 
for the show after mrs beams contacted them she asked that the 
program be rescheduled from 4 pm but so far the station has 
refused 
in augusta ga wagt moved geraldo from 5 pm to 10 am 
in september after sponsors pulled out because of viewer 
complaints led by claire tankersley 
mrs tankersley said she boiled after her 4yearold watched a 
geraldo show in which a prostitute graphically described being 
sexually abused as a child 
i was so horrified and aghast that something like that would 
be on at 5 pm mrs tankersley said im not for censorship 
but i just dont think that kids should be exposed 
sounds familiar said jeffrey ulrich program director of 
wroc in rochester ny which had so many complaints about 
geraldo last year that it canceled the program with three 
months left on the contract 
the opposition we were receiving on the show was tremendous 
geraldo really raised a stink here ulrich said 
knsd in san diego took geraldo off the air last month 
because advertisers withdrew said station controller jay belbey 
mrs beams started her campaign against geraldo after seeing 
a show in which rivera interviewed guests about bestiality 
he asked them if they had had sex with animals she said 
i turned it off 
other shows that raised viewers ire include 
men in lace panties 
kids who murder in the name of satan 
when the other woman is a man 
kiddie porn underground 
i dont think its wrong that some of these issues are 
addressed said ulrich but its the way geraldo exploited 
them phil donahue could cover them and you wouldnt get the same 
complaints geraldos problem lies in his exaggeration and 
sensationalism 
last month at the national association of television program 
executives convention in new orleans rivera and his producers 
courted program directors with promises of a more substantive 
geraldo 
executive producer martin m berman said the show went a 
little wild during the november ratings period when it was 
competing for viewers in 125 markets against the oprah winfrey 
show 
we were pandering and im changing to preserve my own 
reputation rivera recently told electronic media an industry 
publication 
erdel pointed to a show last month about migrant farm workers as 
evidence of a reformed geraldo he said stations are showing 
very strong support and advertisers are coming back 
thats all fine said ulrich but i think hes going to 
have a hard time getting program directors and station managers and 
viewers to believe geraldo is going to be any different

the bus driver is being held as a possible 
accomplice in the terrorist attack on a busload of israeli tourists 
that clained the lives of nine israelis and left 20 people wounded 
newspapers reported today 
saeed abdelraouf a palestinian who gained egyptian 
citizenship fell under suspicion after witnesses said he stopped 
the bus at once when masked gunmen signaled him to do so sunday 
with no warning shot fired said the newspaper alahram 
when abdelraouf appeared on staterun television monday night 
he said he was taken by surprise and stopped the vehicle after 
hearing a bang he thought came from a tire explosion 
the masked men attacked the bus with machine guns and hand 
grenades on a desert road between cairo and the suez canal city of 
ismailiya 
according to infrmation available to police alahram reported 
the attack was carefuly planned abroad and carried out in egypt by 
three gunmen in addition to the bus driver earlier reports spoke 
of two gunmen 
reports in alahram and other cairo newspapers identified the 
man who rented the white peugeot station wagon used in the attack 
as akram deeb ihab a 34yearold palestinian with a jordanian 
passport 
alakhbar newspaper said ihab arrived in egypt on jan 21 and 
left a week later a photograph of him was printed on the front 
pages in alahram and algomhouria 
alahram said about 60 suspects mostly palestinians and a 
number of egyptian noncommissioned police officers were held for 
questioning it said their fingerprints were being compared with 
those found at the scene and on the abandoned white peugoet 
police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said those 
held included a palestinian believed connected with the ambush but 
not as a gunman 
alahram quoted police sources as saying the guns grenades and 
ammunition used in the assault were smuggled into egypt from abroad 
the newspaper said about five policemen boarded the bus in 
rafeh a divided city on the border with israel in the sinai 
peninsula and left the bus when ordered out by the attackers 
the terrorists had asked egyptian hitchhikers on the bus to get 
out before they opening fire on the israelis 
the only other egyptians aboard were the driver and the tour 
guide who was wounded in the attack the bus had been carrying 31 
israeli tourists only two of whom escaped harm 
a spokesman at the interior ministry which is responsible for 
internal security refused to discuss the newspaper reports 
we will talk only after making arrests he said indicating 
that no formal arrests or charges had been made 
alakhbar ran on page one a statement attributed to ahmed 
jibrils popular front for the liberation of palestiniangeneral 
command claiming responsibility for the attack 
it said the claim was broadcast tuesday over libyan state radio 
monitors in london however said they heard no such statement the 
official libyan news agency did not carry the claim 
two arab groups earlier claimed responsibility for the bus 
attack 
one in cairo sunday night was made by an anonymous caller to a 
western news agency who said he spoke for the previously unknown 
organization for the defense of the oppressed in egyptian prisons 
in jordan a handwritten message sent monday to the french news 
agency agence francepresse claimed the assault was carried out by 
an obscure group calling itself holy warjerusalem 
the afp office received a telephone call on tuesday reasserting 
the claim 
our young men all over the world are going to hit again 
strongly and painfully the caller said adding that the bus 
attack is an answer to the killing of our people in the occupied 
territories 
a senior jordanian official in amman said ihab is not a 
jordanian but was from rafah refugee camp in gaza 
israel has occupied the gaza strip and the west bank since 
seizing them in the 1967 middle east war many gaza palestinians 
have carried jordanian passports since 1967 but are not considered 
citizens of jordan which does not hold that a passport is a 
certificate of citizenship 
more than 650 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians since an uprising against the occupation began on dec 
8 1987 fortythree israelis also have died

a republican lawmaker who describes herself 
as a holy roller was excluded from her baptist church for 
sponsoring an abortionrights bill 
a letter from the first baptist church said it denied state rep 
stephanie micklon a family membership because her outspoken 
public position in regard to abortion brings disgrace on jesus 
name 
mrs micklon who was baptized and married at the church called 
it religious blackmail 
im not proabortion it is not an insignificant phrase she 
said tuesday i am prochoice and now theyre saying that is a 
sin 
micklon said she knows of no official church stand that a 
prochoice position is grounds to deny membership 
were pentecostal she said youre talking to a holy 
roller here 
we are not questioning your relationship to christ or your 
salvation the pastor and board of deacons wrote in the recent 
letter that micklon said is all they should be questioning 
she said she and her husband were married and baptized in the 
church but had attended another church until several years ago 
last summer the pastor suggested reaffirming their membership in 
the salem church 
they said there would be no problem she said 
last fall she sponsored legislation to allow abortions at a 
womans discretion until the 25th week of pregnancy the bill 
prohibits abortion after the 25th week unless a doctor deems it 
necessary to protect the life of the mother or the fetus has an 
abnormality 
the micklons have a disabled child and micklon said she based 
her position on abortion on their experience 
first baptists pastor the rev clement sutton iii said the 
church board discussed micklons case at length 
we felt that if the scriptures confirm the sanctity of life 
the legislation was immoral sutton said where stephanie has 
so publicly stated her issue we had to make a choice is it proper 
to take in someone who makes a stand on an issue that is 
unbiblical we couldnt before god and a good conscience recommend 
her for membership 
the first baptist church of salem is part of the american 
baptist churchesusa with headquarters in valley forge pa 
sutton said some church members had been arrested in protests 
organized by operation rescue the nationwide antiabortion group 
roman catholic politicians who support abortion rights have come 
under criticism from their church in california last november a 
bishop denied communion for thenstate senate candidate lucy killea 
for her abortionrights stand she was narrowly elected the

a survey that found nearly one woman in 
six at the university of illinois had been raped could lead campus 
authorities to stop peformances of the pompon squad and campus 
drinking parties 
a mandatory briefing on sexual violence for new students also 
was among the other measures recommended by a task force created to 
resolve problems raised in the survey released tuesday 
vice chancellor stanley levy created the 13member task force 
including students faculty and community members in september 
after viewing preliminary results of the survey on rape at the 
campus which has an undergraduate enrollment of 25950 
the survey conducted last spring found that 164 percent of 
the 537 women who responded said they had been raped that is in 
the same range as two 1985 college studies on the topic one at 
the university of south dakota and another conducted on 32 college 
campuses 
another 23 percent said they were victims of sexual abuse which 
meant fondling or touching 
were talking about acquaintance rape and men in fraternities 
or in campus housing who are sexually abusing women said laurna 
rubinson an associate professor of health who headed the task 
force 
levy and ms rubinson said colleges across the country face the 
same problems 
the study showed a strong relationship between sexual violence 
and alcohol use 
sixtysix of the 88 women who reported being raped answered 
questions about alcohol use of them 80 percent said the men 
involved in the attacks had been drinking at the time and 70 
percent of the women said they themselves had been drinking 
ideally alcohol consumption on campus and at tailgate parties 
outside sporting events would be banned ms rubinson said 
but the school is more likely to increase the number of 
nonalcoholic social events for students levy said the school 
allows drinking on campus by students who are 21 or older 
the school may also consider a proposal to ban performances by 
the illinettes an allfemale pompon squad that performs at 
football and basketball games and other activities that project 
women as sexual objects the report said 
other proposals likely to face opposition included requiring a 
resident director generally an older student at all 
fraternities which were singled out by ms rubinson as the worst 
source of sexual violence against women 
levy defended fraternities and noted that they have instituted 
new rules of conduct on their own including banning keg parties

the male prostitute who ran his business out of 
the washington apartment of rep barney frank said the congressman 
didnt mind until his landlord found out 
i suggested it he okd it steve gobie said tuesday at a 
news conference to promote an article in penthouse magazine on his 
relationship with frank and the sexual underlife of the capital 
frank has said he fired gobie as his aide and driver when he 
learned how his apartment was being used but gobie said frank knew 
not long after the two met in april 1985 and he moved into franks 
apartment where he received his phone calls and clients 
i couldnt have done it without him knowing about it gobie 
said its virtually impossible the answering machines were 
connected to the telephones 
frank the massachusetts democrat issued a statement tuesday 
saying gobies press conference and article are recycled lies 
with some additional sensationalism apparently to justify 
penthouse paying him a 50000 fee 
gobie said he and frank parted after the landlord confronted the 
congressman about the activity in the apartment 
he was angry because the landlord found out not because he 
didnt know it was going on gobie said it wasnt just phone 
work that was going on it was actually individuals coming in and 
out of the place 
he was aware of that hed call and make sure it was ok for 
him to come home if he was due to come home at an inopportune time 
during the day 
gobie 33 said he has testified for five hours before the house 
ethics committee which is probing franks conduct he declined to 
say what kinds of questions he was asked or what he told the 
committee 
frank 49 has acknowledged that he paid gobie for sex the first 
time they met but he says he soon befriended gobie and hired him 
to be a personal aide and driver 
gobie declined to divulge how much penthouse paid him 
he has said and frank has denied that the congressman at one 
point offered him 10000 to 12000 to leave washington and make a 
new start in florida

jesse jackson beginning a 
visit to south africa said today he hoped to see nelson mandela 
walking down the streets of johannesburg before his 12day trip 
ends 
the us civil rights leader granted a visa by the government 
after several rejections in the past decade planned to meet 
president fw de klerk and foreign minister pik botha as well as 
leaders of the antiapartheid movement 
at an airport news conference jackson declined to say if he had 
requested a meeting with mandela the african national congress 
leader who is expected to be released soon after more than 27 years 
in prison 
i have no commitment from the government to meet him 
jackson said i hope to see him walking down the streets of 
johannesburg the whole world hopes to see him free 
on friday in a widely hailed speech de klerk lifted a 30year 
ban on the anc scrapped other restrictive measures and pledged to 
free mandela promptly 
this is a moment in south africas history that must be 
seized jackson said if the government moves back there will 
be chaos but if the government seizes the political moment and 
moves forward we will see the dawn of a new free and democratic 
south africa 
he said he had set two goals for the trip to encourage unity 
among black political factions and to address the unfounded fears 
of the whites 
asked whether he favored continuation of sanctions against south 
africa he replied the real issue is to end apartheid sanctions 
will end with apartheid 
de klerk gave a great speech he said but apartheid is 
still in place the caution is that nelson mandela is still in 
jail 
the afrikaner resistance movement a neonazi white supremacist 
group has threatened to mount protests against jackson but only a 
handful of rightwing demonstrators were seen at the airport and 
they obeyed police orders to avoid displaying placards 
jackson and his wife jackie were welcomed by senior leaders of 
the antiapartheid movement includuing walter sisulu an anc 
colleague of mandelas and church leaders allan boesak and frank 
chikane 
on tuesday botha suggested it was an inopportune time for 
jackson to visit because of the rapid political changes taking 
place 
botha also complained that jackson alternates his statements on 
sanctions depending on his audience botha said jackson has told 
south african officials he favors an end to punitive sanctions 
while appealing in public speeches for added sanctions 
the time has come when jesse and i must talk straight to each 
other botha said 
he said jacksons visit has nothing to do with the release of 
mandela because the decision has already been made he can enjoy 
the aftermath but not claim any credit botha said 
mandela 71 has been in jail since 1962 and is serving life 
imprisonment for planning the start of the ancs sabotage campaign 
against the government

the state has levied a record 910200 in 
fines against a contractor involved in the rushhour collapse of a 
bridge being built over a busy baltimorewashington highway 
the accident aug 31 injured four motorists and six workers 
the maryland occupational safety and health office cited the 
jp smith co of edgewater for 128 willful violations of 
safety codes the most serious type of violation in what the 
agency called a gross disregard for public safety 
the contractor has 15 days to appeal the fines 
among the violations cited was the use of 112 screw jacks of 
inferior size and strength to support steel towers that held the 
bridge in place 
anyone with construction experience had the ability to 
instantly recognize that this was not the equipment that was 
supposed to be used craig d lowry the agencys enforcement 
chief said tuesday 
screw jacks rated to hold 10000 pounds instead of the 25000 
pounds specified in plans approved by federal engineers were used 
he said 
the largest penalty previously proposed by the state agency was 
68000 for a fatal trench cavein in october 
john p smith president of jp smith co said last month that 
he assumed the equipment supplier had provided materials that met 
plan specifications the contractor is rebuilding the overpass 
a federal transportation department panel in december blamed the 
collapse on inadequate equipment and materials used contrary to 
approved plans 
mosh also issued a single serious citation totaling 720 
against highlights corp of towson a subcontractor on the project 
for alleged failure to inspect equipment and supports before the 
concrete was poured for the bridge

the head of aids programs for the world health 
organization said today that medical teams have determined more 
than 700 children in romania are infected with the aids virus 
the situation appears more serious even than we had thought 
said dr jonathan mann the number of infected children now 
exceeds 700 and its clearly a very serious situation we are 
mobilizing the resources to deal with it but i am afraid it is 
worse than we thought 
he said a who medical team is still trying to figure out 
exactly how this has happened and particularly what steps must be 
taken immediately to stop this now 
it is a preventable tragedy mann said on abcs good 
morning america program this need not have happened we now 
need to make sure that nothing more happens of this kind 
mann said the major route of spread apparently was the use of 
untested aidsinfected blood and the repeated use of needles and 
syringes on children without sterilizing them between uses 
earlier this week dr jacques lebas president of the 
parisbased doctors of the world urged the international health 
community to provide romania with disposable needles and 
bloodscreening equipment 
mann said his organization is undertaking an initiative with 
all the countries of eastern europe to determine the scope of the 
problem determine what needs to be done and do it because aids is 
a reality now in eastern europe 
mann was asked whether he expected to find other situations 
similar to that in romania 
lets hope that we dont ever have to see something like this 
again but im afraid that as we look further into the countries of 
eastern europe with the ministries of health that we are going to 
find evidence of more infection than was previously discussed 
particularly in countries like poland and yugoslavia said mann 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims vulnerable to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers a person can carry the human immunodeficiency virus 
which causes aids for years without developing the disease but 
almost all cases lead to the disease

the proapartheid conservative 
party said today it will stage protests and strikes to drive 
president fw de klerk from power and block his plans to share 
power with blacks 
koos van der merwe chief spokesman for the conservatives the 
main white opposition party said de klerk deceived south african 
whites by suddenly legalizing the african national congress 
guerrilla movement and more than 60 other antiapartheid groups 
he said de klerks national party would not be able to retain 
power in the face of a white backlash 
the conservatives are pushing for a new election if de klerk 
rejects that proposal the party would organize stayathome 
campaigns or general strikes that would bring the country to a 
halt van der merwe said 
we will keep the pressure on him until he has no choice 
but to call a general election he said 
if large numbers of whites joined a general strike they could 
bring the government to a standstill halt most transportation and 
shut down businesses schools and hospitals 
on friday de klerk lifted the ban on the anc and other 
opposition groups and partially lifted the state of emergency as 
part of a plan to begin negotiations that would bring the 
disenfranchised black majority into the government 
the president also said the government would soon release nelson 
mandela the jailed anc leader unconditionally but he did not 
give a date 
on tuesday a leading antiapartheid activist said the 
governments drive for peace could be jeopardized by its delay in 
releasing mandela 
he must be released soon or de klerk will lose momentum the 
rev allan boesak said after meeting with mandela for more than 
three hours at victor verster prison farm north of cape town 
boesak said mandela wants the government to lift the state of 
emergency and free all political prisoners including those 
convicted of violent acts but would accept freedom whether or not 
the demands are met 
he said mandela considered de klerks speech bold courageous 
and hopeful but did not believe it had cleared the way for talks 
between the government and the anc 
the rev jesse jackson beginning a visit to south africa said 
today he hopes to see mandela walking down the streets of 
johannesburg before his 12day trip ends 
at an airport news conference the civil rights leader declined 
to say if he had requested a meeting with mandela saying only that 
i have no commitment from the government to meet him 
jackson was recently granted a visa after several rejections in 
the past decade 
van der merwe said today that the national party tricked the 
white electorate by stating during the election campaign last year 
that it would not deal with anc because of its guerrilla campaign 
mr de klerk and his political cabinet are a lot a crooks 
he said 
the conservatives won 31 percent of the vote in septembers 
election compared to 48 percent for the national party 
however the nationalists won 93 of the 166 white parliamentary 
seats compared to 39 for the conservatives the other seats went 
to the liberal democratic party 
van der merwe said whites would never accept majority rule 
because it would result in the 28 million blacks dominating the 5 
million whites he predicted whites would now flock to the 
conservative party which seeks to establish separate states for 
whites and blacks 
we demand the right of selfdetermination we do not want to 
be dominated by the blacks he said 
the conservatives have launched a major membership drive and 
plan hundreds of rallies to demand a new election the campaign 
will culminate with a massive rally in pretoria in may to demand 
that de klerk step down van der merwe said 
he said the conservative party stands for afrikaner nationalism 
and is not racist afrikaners the dutchdescended settlers of 
south africa account for about 3 million of the 5 million whites

communist party leaders today agreed to surrender 
their monopoly on power guaranteed by the soviet constitution 
allowing rival parties to compete for the first time in seven 
decades a delegate said 
the reported vote by the powerful party central committee was a 
victory for president mikhail s gorbachev who had urged his 
fellow party members to face voters and earn the right to rule 
svyatoslav fyodorov a famed eye surgeon and participant in the 
threeday meeting in the kremlin said the committee agreed to 
support abolishing the constitutions article 6 which guarantees 
power to the communist party 
article 6 will no longer be there will be a multiparty 
system there will be a normal democracy fyodorov said 
both hardline communists and reformers had criticized 
gorbachevs platform with hardliners complaining he was going too 
far and reformers saying he failed to go far enough 
populist leader boris n yeltsin cast the only vote against the 
platform fyodorov said apparently because it was not radical 
enough yeltsin on sunday addressed a huge crowd that gathered 
outside the kremlin to demand reforms and he promised to present 
the demands to the central committee 
there also was one abstention fyodorov said 
there were few major changes in the document gorbachev presented 
to the central committee on monday he said 
the 249member central committee was joined in the meeting by 
more than 700 other officials from around the soviet union and all 
were allowed to vote on the platform he said 
the official news agency tass said debate at the closed meeting 
resumed today but did not give details 
sources inside the central committee meeting said the 
policymaking body would recommend to the supreme soviet parliament 
that it delete article 6 
the supreme soviet could take up the issue at its meeting next 
week or after the partys congress which the central committee 
agreed to move up to summer from october 
in either case final authority rests with the supreme soviets 
parent legislative body the congress of peoples deputies at its 
last meeting in december the congress of peoples deputies heeded 
gorbachevs plea and blocked an effort by reformers to strike 
article 6 
but since then gorbachev said it would be no tragedy if a 
multiparty system develops in the soviet union he told the central 
committee on monday that rather than relying on constitutional 
guarantees the party must prove its worthiness to govern 
the central committee which had been scheduled to meet only two 
days continued to consider how to deal with the breakaway party in 
lithuania which split from the national communist party in 
december 
when gorbachev extended the committee session late tuesday he 
told the central committee he wanted its work done by 
midafternoon but the group was unable to meet that deadline 
gorbachev and his advisers were turning their attention after 
the central committee meeting to the arrival later today of us 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
most speakers during debate tuesday agreed the communists must 
end their political monopoly but gorbachevs plans for the partys 
future and his tenure itself drew harsh criticism from 
hardliners 
yegor k ligachev a leading orthodox politburo member was 
warmly applauded tuesday for a speech that blamed gorbachevs 
reform program for the countrys dire economic situation and 
nationalist upheavals a committee source said 
after somewhat of an enlivening in the first two years of 
perestroika the economy began to decline interethnic feuds 
reached bloodshed people began to experience fear and in some 
places there is practically dual power ligachev told the meeting 
in his speech quoted by tass ligachev demanded that the party 
platform emphasize the sacredness of party unity and said he firmly 
opposes allowing private property a demand of radical reformers 
tass quoted three influential politburo members foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze vitaly vorontinkov and vadim 
medvedev as backing gorbachevs program expressing emphatic 
support for a strengthened presidency 
many people believe gorbachev hopes to step down as party chief 
in the communists anticipated fall from power and concentrate 
authority in the presidency and popularly elected legislative 
bodies 
shevardnadze rejected assertions that gorbachevs liberalization 
was to blame for the ouster of communist regimes in eastern europe 
it has been destroyed by the will of peoples who wished no 
longer to tolerate coercion tass quoted shevardnadze as saying 
the committees freewheeling debate sharply contrasted with 
previous sessions when the central committee automatically 
approved policies that had been worked out at higher levels 
a decision to abolish the partys leading role and allow 
competing parties for the first time since shortly after the 1917 
revolution would represent a bold domestic gamble 
it could send the discredited soviet ruling party the way of its 
fraternal communist parties in poland east germany czechoslovakia 
and hungary 
on the local level people across the country have recently 
forced the ouster of communist officials found to have used their 
posts to obtain special food supplies and other perquisites 
unavailable to the average citizen 
people must wait in lines for scarce consumer goods some of 
which are rationed in some areas 
outside the kremlins spassky gate on tuesday central committee 
member vladimir p anishchev was asked about the consensus at the 
gathering over the communist partys future all unanimously 
think it has become obsolete it has no meaning he said 
partial transcripts of tuesdays session in which 51 speakers 
took the floor indicated that gorbachevs proposal satisfied 
neither radicals nor hardliners 
the party has already been fragmented by decembers defection of 
its branch in lithuania the republic leading the way in 
secessionist efforts and moscow radicals are proposing that it 
break up into separate wings 
communist candidates are expected to fare poorly in local 
elections this spring and some progressives in the party want it 
to set the democratic example by having all its leaders chosen by 
secret ballot

the communist party today released a document 
urging increased cooperation with chinas eight tiny noncommunist 
parties while asserting that china will always be under communist 
rule 
the release of the dec 30 document came as communist parties in 
eastern europe are abandoning their hold on power and soviet 
communist party leaders today agreed to surrender their 
constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society according 
to a central committee delegate 
china has not commented on soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposals to abolish the partys 70year monopoly on political 
power 
communist parties in east germany poland czechoslovakia and 
other eastern european countries already have eliminated their 
leading role status 
the chinese document however stressed that chinas 
multiparty cooperation must uphold the leadership by the cpc or 
communist party of china according to a paraphrase by the official 
xinhua news agency chinas state constitution refers to the 
chinese people as being under the leadership of the communist 
party 
in an apparent attempt to distance china from the pattern of 
political reforms that has taken hold of eastern europe the 
document said china differs from the oneparty system practiced 
in some socialist countries 
the chinese leadership has watched with concern the developments 
of the past few months in eastern europe particularly romania 
where the revolution was violent some analysts have said chinas 
leaders hope to prevent a viable opposition from forming in their 
own country by appearing to give the eight officially sanctioned 
noncommunist parties more influence in policymaking 
the communist party has frequently called for more cooperation 
with what it calls the democratic parties but these parties 
hold no real power and are considered rubber stamps for communist 
policy formed before the communists took power in 1949 their 
aging ranks number about 300000 compared with the 
48millionmember communist party 
in a dec 28 speech to party elders senior leader deng xiaoping 
said the democratic parties should be turned from flowervase 
parties into ones that take part in politics 
the newly publicized document appeared to be based on dengs 
comments but does not change the noncommunist parties 
traditionally subordinate role the document also explicitly denied 
the formation of other noncommunist parties 
political organizations that oppose the four cardinal 
principles of socialism peoples democratic dictatorship 
communist party leadership and marxismleninismmao tsetung 
thought and endanger the state power are absolutely not allowed 
to exist

an election recalling the chairman of the 
southern ute indian tribe and four council members has been 
overturned because an election official afraid of being placed 
under a spell let a woman vote twice 
once the womans second illegal vote was thrown out tuesday 
the election wound up a 182182 tie meaning southern ute tribal 
chairman leonard burch and the other council members will stay in 
office after all 
the outcome of fridays recall changed after ruby garcia 
chairwoman of the tribal election commission disclosed that she 
let bertha grove cast two ballots her own and one on behalf of 
her imprisoned husband a vote by proxy rather than absentee ballot 
is illegal 
garcia said grove said we would not sleep that night if 
the woman were not allowed to cast a ballot for her husband 
i didnt know if that was some kind of voodoo garcia said 
she added that she was concerned the woman was going to put a 
spell on all of us 
recall committee members said they would challenge the recount 
in tribal court 
renee baca recall coordinator said her group would seek a new 
election 
recall backers had accused the council of a lack of 
accountability raised doubts about the benefits of two water 
projects and objected to the councils decision to cut from 3000 
to 1500 a year the per capita payments made to tribal members 
from oil and gas leases on their land 
the tribe has 1158 members and is based on a reservation in the 
four corners area of colorado utah new mexico and arizona

the national republican party had a dominant 
fundraising edge to begin the 1990 election year holding 144 
million on hand while the democratic party had 54 million in its 
coffers 
federal election commission data also show the gop dramatically 
outspent the democratic party last year with its three principal 
national fundraising groups spending 722 million compared to 
191 million for the democrats it was a costly off year for both 
parties because of eight special congressional elections 
the republicans generated 804 million in contributions and 
other receipts for those committees with the republican national 
committee taking in 306 million the national republican 
senatorial committee 35 million and the national republican 
congressional committee 14 million 
an analysis released tuesday by the fec showed some marked 
improvement in the democratic partys fundraising particularly 
when compared to other years immediately following a loss in a 
presidential election 
the democratic national committee actually began the year with 
more money than the rnc 38 million compared to 15 million 
but the gops house and senate campaign arms were far more 
successful in raising money than their democratic counterparts 
the fec report based on the yearend disclosure reports of the 
organizations showed that all told the three principal democratic 
groups took in and spent 19 million 
the democratic national committee which ended 1988 with a 
comfortable surplus in the 5 million range reported receipts of 
68 million and the democratic senatorial campaign committee said 
it received 8 million those committees reporting spending of 84 
million and 65 million respectively and both made huge 
reductions in their debts 
by contrast the democratic congressional campaign committee had 
1989 receipts of 41 million but reported spending 42 million 
and a yearend debt of 16 million it reported having just 
22179 on hand to begin the year 
while the republicans enter this election year with more cash on 
hand democrats have the power of incumbency in the majority of 
house and senate elections incumbents generally run well ahead of 
their challengers in raising funds 
most of the 144 million in the three republican war chests to 
begin the year was with the nrsc which reported having 106 
million as of dec 31 the gop hopes to chip away at the 5545 
democratic majority in the senate as part of a larger strategy that 
banks on a reelection win by president bush in 1992 and a coattail 
effect that would return control of the senate to republicans 
the gop senate committee spent 27 million of the 354 million 
it received last year and reported 589734 in debts as of dec 31 
about half its 11 million debt at the end of 1987 the last 
comparable nonfederal election year 
the nrcc the gops main fundraising arm for house candidates 
spent 131 million of the 142 million it collected according to 
its yearend filing with the fec it held 23 million heading into 
this year and reported debts of 794654 up dramatically from the 
34922 in red ink it reported two years ago 
for all of the committees the totals raised include 
contributions and other receipts such as interest on bank accounts 
and certificates of deposit 
separate fec data on the special elections last year show nearly 
11 million was spent on the eight races there were 41 initial 
candidates in the eight elections and the 16 who survived for the 
final headtohead contests accounted for 89 million of the 
spending total

president roh taewoo said today that 
south korea must further develop its military forces to prepare for 
an eventual withdrawal of us troops from the country 
roh made the remarks after receiving a briefing by the defense 
ministry on various security problems south korea is expected to 
face in the coming decade 
we must pursue the koreanization of our defense american 
troops are here only to help us we must be prepared to defend our 
nation with our own blood and sweat he said 
in a report to roh defense minister lee sanghoon said south 
korea will have to increase its defense spending substantially in 
the coming years to prepare for an eventual us troop pullout 
the united states announced last week that it would close three 
of its five air bases in south korea in a costsaving measure the 
decision will mean the withdrawal of 2000 of the 43000 us 
troops stationed in south korea under a mutual defense treaty but 
officials in washington have not said anything about the united 
states pulling out the bulk of its forces 
south korean officials later indicated they expected to discuss 
the withdrawal of some 3000 more us troops all noncombatants 
when us defense secretary dick cheney visits seoul feb 1417 
lee did not disclose the amount of defense spending south korea 
envisages in the coming years but said his ministry would earmark 
more funds for research and development to produce missiles combat 
planes submarines and other sophiscated weapons in the early 2000s 
south korea he said spent only 15 percent of its defense 
budget on research and development in 1980 but the amount will be 
increased to 3 percent in 1996 and 7 percent in 2000 
more spending on research and development will enable us to 
develop nextgeneration weapons on our own he said 
south korea depends almost entirely on the united states for its 
weapons systems but the country recently has made impressive 
progress in developing its own weapons including new army tanks 
more suited to korean terrain 
south korean defense spending is fixed at 6 percent of its gross 
national product the gnp has expanded at an annual rate of 8 
percent to 9 percent during the past decade last years korean gnp 
was estimated at 194 billion 
as a deterrent to what he called the growing north korean 
military threat the minister said south korea needs to maintain 
close security relations with the united states and share more of 
the costs of keeping us troops here 
he said however that south korea also must be prepared for an 
eventual pullout of all 43000 american troops stationed in the 
country the withdrawal if made should be gradual he added 
analysts saw lees remarks as indicating south korea would 
accept a withdrawal of american troops rather than taking on an 
excessive financial burden to keep them

covenant house named a former school 
administrator today to take over the rev bruce ritters duties 
while the founder of the runaway shelter is investigated on 
suspicion of having sex with teenagers 
the appointment of former new york city schools chancellor frank 
macchiarola as acting president came as the new york post reported 
a fourth man has come forward to say he had sex with ritter when he 
was a teenage runaway 
the franciscan priest who founded covenant house and has seen it 
grow into the nations largest shelter system for runaways 
reasserted his innocence tuesday even as he found himself the 
subject of new charges 
in a statement ritter said he had decided to take several weeks 
off to rest and recuperate from stress later in the day however 
church officials said they had instructed him to relinquish his 
duties 
franciscan officials have directed father bruce to begin a 
period of rest and recuperation without responsibility for covenant 
house until this inquiry is completed their provincial leader 
the rev conall mchugh said in a statement a spokesman said he 
had no idea how long that may be 
ritter 62 had not considered stepping down a spokesman said 
covenant house said macchiarola schools chancellor from 1978 to 
1983 would immediately assume ritters duties macchiarola has 
served on the covenant house board for five years 
the events unfolded after the new york times disclosed the 
franciscans investigation of a former covenant house clients 
charges that ritter had a sexual relationship with him in 1973 
when he was 14 two other former covenant house clients also have 
accused ritter of sexual misconduct 
ritter who has campaigned against the sexual exploitation of 
youngsters characterized such charges as garbage telling the 
times he never never had sexual relations with any youth in 
covenant house 
i am profoundly saddened by the allegations against me and the 
need to deny them constantly he said in his statement i have 
no way of proving my innocence my accusers cannot establish my 
guilt i devoutly hope the inquiries currently under way will bring 
an end to this incredibly painful chapter in my life 
in addition to the franciscan investigation the district 
attorney is investigating covenant houses use of funds and its 
provision of false identification to at least one youth 
covenant house conceded monday it had provided a former male 
prostitute with a new identity that of a 10yearold boy who died 
in 1980 it admitted acting without the knowledge of the boys 
parents saying it had sought to protect the exprostitute kevin 
kite from enemies 
it has refused to say how it obtained the documents kite now 
26 says he was given a certified copy of the boys birth 
certificate and a falsified copy of his baptismal certificate 
kite is one of those now making charges against ritter in 
december the new york post reported his allegations that he had an 
eightmonth sexual relationship with the priest beginning a year 
ago he said ritter gave him money housing and gifts in exchange 
for sex 
ritter has denied the charges and kites father stepped forward 
to describe his son as a chronic liar 
at a dec 14 news conference ritter warned that copycats 
might make charges similar to kites however the new accusations 
from two other men appear to predate the december disclosure 
the village voice newspaper reported jan 24 that john melican 
now of seattle charged in an unpublished interview in 1986 that he 
had a 13year sexual relationship with ritter melican repeated the 
charges to the times saying the relationship began when he was 13 
darryl bassile 31 of ithaca charged that he had sexual 
relations with ritter in 1973 the times said it said notes by 
bassiles psychotherapist show that he complained about ritter in 
april 
bassile said he complained to the franciscans after hearing of 
kites charges in december 
today the post said paul johnson 33 had a homosexual affair 
with ritter when he was a teenage runaway 
johnson who was sentenced in 1986 in los angeles to a year in 
jail for corporate fraud told the post no one else in this 
country is doing as much to help kids on the street he helped me a 
lot but i also have to say that i have deeprooted hatred for the 
way he manipulated me 
covenant house has an 87 million budget running 17 shelters 
with more than 2000 beds in the united states canada and latin 
america the times said it planned to expand this year but 
donations after tripling in four years have declined since 
december and the plans are on hold

a political arrangement that would bring 
this remote western pacific archipelago more selfgovernment and 
nearly 500 million in us aid headed for defeat today at the 
hands of the voters 
early returns showed about half of the voting palauans supported 
a compact of free association and subsidiary agreements with the 
united states but the results were falling short of the required 
75 percent 
with 23 percent of the vote counted from tuesdays polling 51 
percent opposed the compact and 49 percent approved final results 
werent expected until at least friday 
vice president kuniwo nakamura who backed the compact conceded 
it would fail 
as a result palau will continue as the worlds last un 
trusteeship under us administrative authority ten other 
territories formed in 1947 under the trusteeship system have 
achieved independence or selfgovernment 
the united states captured the islands in 1944 from japan 
the plebiscite was the seventh in seven years on the pact and 
its subsidiary agreements already us law 
before the latest plebiscite sen j bennett johnston dla 
ha asked the department of interior to reexamine its policy toward 
palau if approval wasnt attained interior officials have said 
they may bolster their presence 
palau is a collection of 200 volcanic islands the westernmost 
cluster of six major groups making up the caroline islands an 
estimated 15000 people live on its eight inhabited islands about 
500 miles east of the phillipines city of mindanao and 4500 miles 
southwest of hawaii 
several factors apparently led to the no vote perhaps foremost 
among them antinuclear sentiment one of the provisions on the 
ballot would have allowed us nuclearcapable aircraft and vessels 
to transit palau 
larry n gerston a san jose state university political science 
professor found a strong antinuclear feeling in an exit survey of 
1235 palau voters 
of no voters 49 percent said it was because of the 
possibility of us nuclear materials in palau gerston said 
another 35 percent said they voted no because there was not 
enough money in the pact 
it was not immediately clear what palaus government would do 
next 
in a jan 29 letter to interior secretary manuel lujan johnston 
recommended that interior officials exercise greater law 
enforcement and financial management of palauan affairs 
nakamura said the government would persist in trying to get the 
compact approved perhaps by holding a referendum to lower the 75 
percent requirement to a simple majority 
the status issue must be resolved if possible this year 
he said it is the most important issue facing the republic

arizonas voterapproved official english law 
is kaput finis finito terminado 
us district court judge paul rosenblatt threw out the law on 
free speech grounds tuesday and gov rose mofford the only 
person with legal standing to appeal said she would let the 
ruling stand 
i am happy the courts ruled it unconstitutional mrs 
mofford said in a brief statement she said she considered the law 
which made english the states official language flawed from the 
beginning 
backers of the measure said the democratic governor should 
appeal the decision noting a state court had upheld the measures 
constitutionality last year and because similar laws in 16 other 
states had been allowed to stand 
republican state attorney general bob corbin said he believed 
any ruling that changes the states constitution should be appealed 
as high as possible but he said he would abide by mrs moffords 
decision 
the initiative approved 580830569993 in the 1988 election 
required state and county governments to conduct all business in 
english with certain exceptions in education public health and 
safety the justice system and federal election law 
the judge said the amendment would have forced lawmakers 
officials and judges to either violate their sworn oaths to obey 
the state constitution or to curtail their free speech rights 
in such cases as talking with foreignspeaking constituents and 
performing marriage ceremonies 
he said the amendment was substantially overbroad and 
invalid on its face in violation of the first amendment of the 
us constitution 
the ruling came on a lawsuit by mariakelly yniguez a state 
department of administration employee and state sen jaime 
gutierrez a democrat 
ms yniguez who evaluates and arbitrates medical malpractice 
claims said the law inhibited her constitutional right to free 
speech and threatened her job if she used spanish while speaking 
with coworkers 
gutierrez who represents a partially hispanic district in 
tucson said the law could block him from communicating effectively 
with constituents 
rosenblatt dismissed gutierrez from the case on technical 
grounds but said yniguez was justified in her concerns 
im just very happy gutierrez said if you can write that 
im jumping up and down thats just what im doing 
i thought it was a longshot he added it took a lot of 
courage on the part of the judge i hope the decision can be used 
nationwide but well just fight the battles one at a time 
supporters of the law said the decision should be appealed to 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco 
last april the us supreme court instructed that court to 
dismiss a challenge to a rule that generally requires los angeles 
city court employees to speak only english while at work the 
justices decided to take such action because the woman who 
challenged the rule no longer works for the court 
the legal meaning of official english amendments in some 
states is far from clear in colorado the governor and mayor of 
denver ordered bilingual government information to still be 
provided and in florida the legislature has taken no steps to 
pass laws that put voterapproved englishonly provisions into 
effect

have been going on for months and both sides had agreed pope john 
paul ii would visit the country next year 
in addition to signing the agreement casaroli will take part in 
ceremonies unveiling a statue of the late cardinal josef 
mindszenty who was sentenced to life imprisonment for treason in a 
stalinist show trial in 1949 
mindszenty who became a symbol of church opposition to 
communism was freed from prison by hungarian revolutionaries 
during the 1956 uprising after the revolt was crushed by soviet 
tanks mindszenty took refuge in the us legation in budapest 
where he remained until the vatican and hungary worked out an 
agreement in 1971 he died in vienna in 1975 
the ousted czechoslovak communist regime had been among the most 
hostile to the roman catholic church in eastern europe blocking 
the nomination of new bishops for 15 years

restore ties with the vatican and the polishborn pope plans to 
visit in april 
with a series of recent appointments including the nomination 
tuesday of korec in nitra only four of 13 dioceses lack bishops

bishop in 1951 a practice used by the church to ensure it has a 
hierarchy in a country where it cant operate freely korec 66 
spent eight years in prison and then was barred from working as a 
bishop

tuesday afternoon contained a sharp denouncement of the 
leaderships methods 
he maintained that his attempt to reorganize the ministry of 
tourism was impeded by excessive government bureaucracy 
dictatorial methods in the relationship between the government 
and the ministry and an improper and illdefined division of 
responsibility between the government and the front 
lupoi said that at a meeting tuesday evening other ministers 
accused him of trying to take the people into the streets 
against the front and attempted to head off his resignation by 
firing him instead 
eventually he said he agreed to resubmit a more moderate 
version of his letter and the resignation was accepted this 
morning 
lupoi contended that the front had to accept a multiparty 
democracy because of popular demand but they dont like it 
on tuesday the front officially registered to run in the may 20 
elections with interim president ion iliescu expected to lead the 
ticket 
the front originally promised only to rule until the elections 
but reversed its stand two weeks ago it is considered the 
frontrunner in the race against 29 political parties 
dan radulescu chief of the fronts commission for press and 
public relations said our candidate for president will be mr 
iliescu thats for sure thats what everyone wants 
the front agreed to form a council of national unity with 
opposition parties to run the country until romanias first 
multiparty elections since world war ii the council is to meet for 
the first time friday 
in its platform released tuesday the front said its aim is 
realization in romania of a democratic society based on political 
pluralism the separation of powers in the state the assurance of 
liberty and human dignity 
it also said it sought to guarantee the inviolability of human 
rights the respecting of the rights and liberties of all national 
minorities the guarantee of freedom of religion 
the platform included membership guidelines and an outline of 
the partys structure it bars from membership anyone convicted of 
crimes against the revolution 
the platform made no mention of the communist party last month 
the front announced it would outlaw the party then it decided to 
submit the question to a referendum only to cancel the vote a 
short time later

surgeons operated by candlelight and 
emergency rooms used water boiled on kerosene stoves today as 
fighting between rival christian forces plunged east beirut into 
more desperate conditions 
in the ninth day of a showdown over control of lebanons 
christian enclave gen michel aoun regrouped his army troops for a 
major assault to dislodge samir geageas lebanese forces militia 
from its besieged strongholds 
geagea pleaded with president francois mitterrand of france to 
act swiftly to arrange an immediate halt to the hysterical 
killing which has claimed about 365 lives and wounded 1682 by 
police count 
police said scores of the wounded mostly civilians were dying 
at hospitals due to scarcity of antibiotics and other medicines 
aouns 20000 troops and the 6000member militia are fighting 
across denselypopulated residential districts seeking to control 
the 310squaremile christian enclave 
the hotel dieu and saint joseph hospitals the largest medical 
centers in christian east beirut said in separate statements that 
they would bury about 30 victims in mass graves today the bodies 
were decomposing in morgues due to a total power failure 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said surgeons were carrying out operations in several 
hospitals with candlelight in desperate efforts to rescue the 
victims 
most hospitals have run out of diesel oil to operate their 
power generators they are back to the 19th century methods of 
boiling water on kerosene stoves for the operation rooms the 
spokesman said 
french humanitarian minister bernard kouchner and ambassador 
rene ala negotiated a 90minute ceasefire along a narrow street 
needed to evacuate 12 seriously wounded from two hospitals 
at 930 am a sevenambulance convoy dashed across the divided 
citys museum crossing to evacuate the wounded from the hotel dieu 
and saint joseph hospitals as the factions exchanged sniper fire 
overhead 
the convoy drove the victims out of the ashrafiyeh district to 
beirut airport in the syrianpoliced western sector where a french 
plane waited to fly them for treatment in paris 
at one point the convoy passed a white mercedes its driver lay 
dead in the road beside his car 
the police spokesman said the intensity of clashes had decreased 
since aoun achieved his most significant victory in the 
confrontation flushing geageas men out of the dbaye hills they 
controlled north of beirut late tuesday 
the spokesman said the general was massing tanks commando and 
infantry units for major attacks on geageas men in east beiruts 
besieged districts of ashrafiyeh and ein rummaneh 
aoun the police spokesman said also was massing large numbers 
of tanks in mountainous regions northeast of the capital in 
apparent preparation for a push west to rescue his helicopter base 
at adma where an estimated 500 commandos are withstanding a siege 
by the lebanese forces 
president elias hrawi on tuesday asked for foreign support for 
whatever move he might make to try to stop the fratricide 
indicating he might use the mostly moslem syrianbacked units of 
the army to stop aoun 
a source in moslem west beirut who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said hrawi was considering a plan to help contain the 
fighting the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
first part would be a political move that depends on geagea 
the respected annahar daily newspaper said geagea in a move 
aimed at rescuing his militia might declare territories he 
controls in kesrouan byblos and batroun provinces north of beirut 
loyal to president hrawi 
hrawis 22000strong troops backed by 40000 syrian soldiers 
control 70 percent of lebanon excluding the christian enclave and 
the similarsized territory israel occupies in south lebanon 
allowing hrawis authority to spread in geageas regions would 
strip aoun of about half of the christian enclave he is fighting to 
control 
hrawi was elected by parliament in november as part of a peace 
plan designed to end the 15yearold christianmoslem civil war 
hrawi dismissed aoun as military chief but the general who 
rejects the peace plan and does not recognize the president has 
refused to relinquish his command 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronites the catholic community 
that has dominated lebanese politics since independence from france 
in 1943

an anonymous jury deliberating whether john 
gotti ordered a union leader shot listened again to the murky tape 
recordings on which the government built its assault case against 
the reputed mob boss 
the jurors who have been sequestered since the start of the 
case and whose identities have been kept secret to guard against 
jury tampering reheard the 11 secretly recorded tapes in their 
first day of deliberations monday 
deliberations resumed this morning 
the tapes recorded at gottis hangout and in a jail visiting 
room include conversations in which he allegedly says were 
gonna gonna bust him up and another in which members of the 
westies gang allegedly say they shot union leader john f oconnor 
as a favor to gotti 
the defense has ridiculed the tapes as inaudible and claims 
prosecutors transcribed them to suit their theory defense 
attorneys bruce cutler and gerald shargel contend gotti is being 
persecuted because of his reputation 
gotti a barrelchested man known as the dapper don because of 
his expensive doublebreasted suits is reputed to be the boss of 
the gambino crime family the nations most powerful criminal 
organization 
gotti 49 and anthony guerrieri 61 are accused of 
commissioning the westies an irishamerican gang from new yorks 
hells kitchen section that did strongarm work for the mob to 
shoot oconnor in 1986 
the former vice president of a carpenters union local was 
wounded in the buttocks 
assistant district attorney michael cherkasky said gotti

restaurant being built with nonunion labor 
if convicted gotti could face 25 years to life in prison 
because of prior convictions 
acting justice edward mclaughlin told the jurors monday that 
they could convict the defendants only if the prosecution proved

coast guard officers who boarded the 
exxon valdez as it created the nations worst oil spill asked capt 
joseph hazelwood to explain the problem and a witness said he 
replied youre looking at it 
defense attorney michael chalos suggested that hazelwoods reply 
referred to the overall situation on the crippled tanker 
but exxon valdez chief radio officer joel roberson who related 
the statement in court tuesday disagreed with that interpretation 
i took it to mean that he meant himself roberson said 
minutes after hazelwoods interrogation a coast guard commander 
came to his radio office to use a phone roberson said 
i overheard the commander saying i smelled alcohol on his 
breath i want a technician out here roberson recalled 
blood tests on hazelwood taken 10 hours after the tanker ran 
aground showed a bloodalcohol content 0061 percent lower than 
many states driving 01 limit but above the 004 federal limit for 
operating a commercial vessel 
superior court judge karl johnstone suggested out of the jurys 
presence that the prosecution was failing to address a critical 
issue whether there was liquor found aboard the exxon valdez that 
night if no liquor was found he said it would mean that 
hazelwoods bloodalcohol level might have been much higher earlier 
in the evening 
the first two days of testimony in hazelwoods criminal trial 
have focused on his alcohol consumption in the hours before the 
ship set out on its doomed journey shortly after midnight last 
march 24 the tanker hit bligh reef spilling more than 10 million 
gallons of oil into prince william sound the disaster killed 
thousands of fish birds and animals and blackened hundreds of 
miles of shoreline exxon has said it spent more than 2 billion on 
the cleanup 
roberson remembered being jolted from his sleep by a rumbling 
but said he didnt immediately realize the ship had grounded 
i sensed that it was something very serious he said i 
noticed vapors enough to make my eyes water i noticed the ship was 
listing 
when he went above he said there was a stream of water 
shooting up into the air on deck about 40 to 50 feet high 
soon he said there was a commotion of people coming 
aboard including the coast guardsmen who were met by hazelwood 
one gentleman asked what the nature of the problem was said 
roberson captain hazelwood said youre looking at it 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is being tried on a felony 
charge of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges 
of reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating 
a vessel while intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on 
all counts is seven years three months in prison and 61000 in 
fines 
during tuesdays testimony roberson marine pilot william e 
murphy and chief engineer jerzy glowacki testified they had been 
at a bar where hazelwood drank vodka during the day but saw no 
signs of intoxication when the captain boarded the ship that 
evening 
i would describe him as serious calm said roberson 
except for a trace of liquor on his breath murphy said 
hazelwood appeared sober and in control of the exxon valdez an hour 
before the catastrophe 
did you see anything that indicated the captain was impaired 
in any way chalos asked 
not at all murphy replied firmly 
did he seem in command of this vessel chalos asked 
oh absolutely murphy said 
glowacki said he saw hazelwood drink three straight vodkas and 
the engineer said he consumed three gin and tonics before boarding 
the ship but he said hazelwood was steady on his feet and he 
didnt see him drink again aboard ship all three said exxon 
forbids liquor on the ship 
glowackis testimony also deflated a prosecution theory that 
hazelwood in the wake of the accident tried to back the ship off 
the rocks 
was the engine ever placed in reverse after the grounding 
asked hazelwood lawyer dick madson 
it was not said the engineer

the opposition today demanded that the 
communists disband party cells at work places and accused the 
government of resisting reform to gain advantage in multiparty 
elections in may 
the union of democratic forces an umbrella group representing 
opposition groups proposed during reform talks with the communists 
that a constitutional amendment be presented to parliament 
dissolving the communist party organizations at factories the 
state bta news agency reported 
the opposition plan also would bar any other political party 
from forming organizations at work places bta said 
the opposition is pressing a demand also lodged by reformers 
elsewhere in the east bloc who have tried to rid industries of the 
party organizations that often serve as shadow managements and 
control scarce commodities and privileges 
the communists said the issue of the partys presence in the 
economy would be regulated in a law on political parties now being 
drafted and likely to be submitted to parliament in march bta 
reported without elaboration 
talks are to resume feb 12 when a special working group will 
review the issue the agency said 
the talks involving the communists the union of democratic 
forces and other social and political groups started last month 
and are aimed at instituting reforms in preparation for the 
nations first free postwar elections now planned for may 
at todays talks the opposition charged that the communist 
partys wish to preserve its structures until elections gives it 
advantages despite renunciation of constitutional guarantees about 
its leading role bta said 
compared with their east bloc neighbors bulgarian communists 
have given up relatively little power bolstered by a century of 
roots in the nations politics and a relatively weak although 
growing opposition 
at a party congress last week the communists ousted ranks of 
the old guard and gave the helm to a moderate reformer alexander 
lilov 
another moderate communist andrei lukanov became prime minster 
and said he would present his government to parliament on thursday 
the communists have made a vague proposal for a government of 
national concord to rule until the elections but the 
opposition has balked at participating saying it will have little 
influence

the westerly ri sun on the federal budget 
it is such a joy to see that the 1991 proposed federal budget 
does not resemble one put out by ronald reagan that it is tempting 
to say the first allgeorge bush budget is good enough 
it isnt not nearly 
in a government budget when the economic assumptions are too 
optimistic the deficit leaps wildly ahead the rosy bush 
budget lowballs inflation in 1991 at 4 percent and is really 
pushing it when it forecasts a 33 percent increase in the gnp 
if the office of management and budget is off by only 1 percent 
in its projection for the increase in the gross national product 
the projected 63 billion deficit jumps 18 billion 
the national debt will cross the 3 trillion mark this year 
interest payments on that debt now eat up 14 percent of all tax 
dollars the bush budget has not done enough to slow this 
catastrophic misuse of our money

the santa fe nm new mexican on the peace dividend 
recent polling data confirm that three out of four americans 
believe the end of the cold war should lead to cutbacks in military 
spending producing a peace dividend 
so where is the peace dividend there isnt one although the 
whole premise of the postwar military buildup is crumbling before 
our eyes there are no savings in the bush administrations budget 
from defense spending cuts 
to reverse the upward spiral of the past decade the budget does 
propose to close dozens of military bases and to cut five army 
divisions but just halting unbridled growth is not what is needed 
to adjust our economy to the momentous changes that have swept the 
world in past months 
a fair share of what ought to be the peace dividend should go 
toward reducing the federal deficit a major dead weight on our 
economy in addition we should be using a dividend to fund 
economic conversion projects 
in the end the peace dividend would be spent for the same 
purpose as defense dollars would have been to make america strong 
its just that in changing times our definition of strength must 
change as well

the flint mich journal on the state of the union 
east europes great freedom revolution of 1989 has shredded the 
iron curtain and continues to bring down walls of communist 
repression 
no longer should anyone doubt that the dangerous chill of cold 
war that threatened to undo humanity and destroy spaceship earth 
has finally yielded to warmer relations between the western 
alliance and the warsaw pact 
freedomloving people around the world inspired by americas 
200year example have finally overcome tyrants of failed economic 
and political systems to usher in a brighter and more prosperous 
era not just for the united states but for our entire planet 
but the foreign and domestic challenges facing the united states 
remain as great as ever in too many ways america has fallen 
behind the worlds other great industrial powers we have much to 
do to restore the financial health of our debtridden economy to 
pursue the fairness of trade between nations to upgrade the 
education of our young to end the scourge of drug abuse to 
protect our endangered environment to make health care and child 
care and housing affordable and available to all who need it and 
to ease the poverty and hopelessness of our fellow americans this 
demanding work requires cooperation sacrifice and discipline 
still after listening to president bushs inspiring state of 
the union address most americans should take comfort 
that the direction we are moving in both as citizens of america 
and of the world is positive the ideals goals and standards of 
excellence to which the president has committed our nation and 
which have won bipartisan acclaim are attainable if we have the 
heart and will 
certainly the thaw in eastwest relations will ease the task by 
allowing us to use our precious human and economic resources for 
peace and national development instead of for the continuation of 
an expensive weapons buildup against the threat of that ultimate 
madness global nuclear annihilation

statesmanjournal salem ore on church taxes 
the us supreme court decision to uphold californias tax on 
the mailorder business of tv evangelist jimmy swaggart has raised 
howls from other church groups these include the national council 
of churches and others who would not normally be swaggart fans 
the business of the churches is not business the special tax 
treatment given to churches is partly in recognition of the social 
role they play by ministering to the religious needs of the 
community the assumption is that they are dependent on the private 
contributions of their supporters 
the debated tax involved 17 million worth of religious books 
tapes and other items sold during eight years from swaggarts baton 
rouge la base to customers in california which has a sales tax 
most churches seem to be continually short on money and 
searching for new ways to raise money 
according to the destination of income theory businesses that 
support otherwise taxexempt organizations are not themselves 
protected from tax 
likewise only that part of a churchs property that is used to 
support the primary function of the church is exempt from property 
tax 
and that is as it should be when churches or other charitable 
organizations branch out into roles that traditionally are filled 
by private business they lose their claim to special treatment 
because of public service

illness cannot afford to die they simply run out of money to cover 
the enormous cost of dying 
prudential insurance co of america will allow terminally ill 
policyholders and those permanently confined to nursing homes to 
tap into death benefits while they are still alive 
it makes perfect sense the insurance company has to pay the 
money out at some point why not offer the money to elderly 
patients and their families if there is trouble meeting medical 
benefits 
prudentials program will be tried initially in 10 states the

the waukesha county wis freeman on social security 
social security has been getting a lot of attention on capitol 
hill lately and thats good its time to do something about the 
burden of social security taxes 
were not being provincial when we say we like the plan sen 
robert kasten rwis has come up with like his congressional 
counterpart sen daniel moynihan dny kasten proposes taking 
the social security trust fund out of the general fund so the 
surplus in the fund can no longer be used to mask the massive 
deficits the federal government has run up 
thats a good idea because its too early for congressmen to 
count that money as part of the general fund and not feel pressured 
to rein in their spending 
but thats about all the two plans have in common whereas 
moynihans proposal calls for a tax increase to pay off the 
deficit kastens calls for three years of tax cuts along with a 
reduction in federal spending 
kastens cuts focus on the social security tax itself he 
suggests cutting the current 62 percent tax rate to 59 this year 
to 56 percent in 1991 and to 53 percent in 1992 taxpayers would 
save more than 500 over that threeyear period 
under kastens plan the government would collect 71 billion 
less in social security taxes but the trust fund would still be 
able to cover its expenses 
and where would that 71 billion be in your pocket where it 
belongs

the united states became a deadbeat for good reasons the united 
nations had become an amplifier for sovietstyled socialism but 
the communist party is on the ropes and the united nations has 
become a more moderate and important voice in world affairs 
today eastern europe wants the help of the united nations and 
the united nations is due at least some credit for an increasing

san francisco chronicle on the flow of aliens across the mexican 
border 
the installation of highintensity floodlights along a 
particularly porous stretch of the californiamexico border is the 
latest effort by immigration experts to stem the steady northward 
march of illegal aliens but it too has failed 
border patrol officials say they have virtually lost control of 
the human traffic that gathers each night across the sewagefilled 
tijuana river channel waiting to make a mad dash for jobs in 
california 
while america must remain committed to supporting the oppressed 
of other nations it is also true that california will never have 
the wherewithal to make up for the massive economic failings of 
mexico 
redoubled effort must be addressed to this problem whether it 
be a question of subsidizing a larger border patrol program or 
stiffer penalties for us employers who hire illegal aliens or 
greater us investment in the mexican economy

the west central tribune willmar minn on the soviet union 
a few years ago it would have been unthinkable for americans to 
be rooting for the success of a leader of the soviet union now 
amid rumors of his impending demise we are hopeful that soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev can fend off internal political attacks 
and achieve his economic and political reforms in the soviet union 
its a wonder that it took so long for a failed ideology to 
succumb to reality the soviet union is and will continue to be a 
military superpower but economically its a basket case outside 
of warfare military might can maintain political dominance only so 
long in order for power to be lasting it must include economic 
strength 
if the communist hardliners fear war as much as we do then 
there may be hope for gorbachev he must buy time in order to gain 
political support for reform it will be a long and painful 
process changing from a rigid centrally controlled economy to a 
market economy has been compared to changing planes in midair 
if the soviet people are patient reform will come meanwhile 
big macs might tide them over and even whet their appetites for a 
higher standard of living they will enjoy in a more democratic 
society

the telegraph nashua nh on the soviet union 
mikhail gorbachev has allowed the changes in the soviet 
satellites to happen by refusing to send the soviet troops to beat 
back popular demands for change 
a demonstration in moscow over the weekend huge by soviet 
standards also was met without a punitive crackdown by the army or 
secret police 
that augurs well for the elimination of the constitutional 
clause that guarantees the communist party will always have the 
upper hand in soviet affairs 
a multiparty system may not solve all problems as gorbachev 
has warned but it would bring new people and new ideas into

the waco texas tribuneherald on us troops in panama 
vice president dan quayles trip to latin america and the 
caribbean was a worthy gesture but was doomed from the start 
instead of easing hard feelings over the invasion of panama the 
trip gave latin leaders a fresh opportunity to display resentment 
against the united states that seems always just beneath the 
surface 
the leaders of mexico venezuela and peru found it 
inconvenient to receive quayle so he went to panama where he 
was welcomed and to honduras and jamaica where all he heard was 
get the troops out of panama 
some troops from the invasion force remain in panama because 
panamanians want them there the remnants of ousted dictator manuel 
noriegas police force and army must be reorganized before the 
nation can take responsibility for its own security that will take 
more time 
the present leaders of panama are the same ones chosen in free 
elections last may which is good enough for the panamanians but 
not good enough for the rest of latin america they refuse to 
recognize the government that took power with american help 
how all this concern for panama managed to stay bottled up 
during the brutal corrupt noriega years remains a mystery 
the united states must remove the last invasion troops from 
panama as soon as possible but cannot do so yet until the troops 
can leave we will have to put up with the resentment aimed this 
way from the south and take most of it with a grain of salt

philadelphia daily news on german reunification and the united

the east germans despite 40odd years of rhetoric are talking 
seriously about reunification with west germany a thought that 
cant fail to cause a twinge among people familiar with the german 
fondness for marching through their neighbors homes armed to the 
teeth and feeling mean 
it makes a lot of sense for the east germans 
west germany after all is a wildly successful capitalist state 
that also maintains layer upon layer of social benefits along with 
intelligently generous spending on infrastructure items like 
education east germany would be foolish not to hitch its rickety 
wagon to that threepointed mercedesbenz star 
hmmmmm 
looking at the way things are working out here especially as 
president bush and congress keep diddling with the deficit our 
industry spirals downward and our branches of government compete 
only over who can give the most to the already rich an idea 
glimmers 
why dont we unite with the west germans 
or allow ourselves to be acquired appalling as it seems to have 
the germans be white knights 
they can handle our invasions of small countries and our

the bush administration today urged congress 
to be patient with chinese leaders despite the appalling 
tragedy of their bloody crackdown last june on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger told the senate 
foreign relations committee the administration knows that not 
enough has been done to restore human rights in china but he 
said we never expected to reverse events overnight 
defending the administrations rapprochement with chinese 
leaders eagleburger said the crackdown on demonstrators in beijing 
was a tragic setback in otherwise slow but steady progress 
toward reform 
the china of the 1980s despite the appalling tragedy of 
tiananmen square has come a long way from the era of the gang of 
four in the 1970s eagleburger said he cited foreign investment 
cultural and educational exchanges and openness to the news media 
his testimony came as the human rights group asia watch 
reported repression of chinese dissenters has deepened despite the 
lifting of martial law 
the groups report harshly critical of bushs china policy 
largely mirrored a stillconfidential state department report 
listing widespread human rights violations in china 
many in congress believe the evidence of chinese repression 
makes it even more difficult for bush to defend his current efforts 
at rapprochement just eight months after the brutal crushing of 
the prodemocracy movement 
eagleburger has been at the center of bushs secret 
policymaking traveling on two clandestine trips to china with 
national security adviser brent scowcroft in the months since the 
crackdown 
the administration since the killings of protesters in beijing 
last june 4 has reverted to a shabby double standard insofar 
as the question of human rights in china is concerned the asia 
watch report concluded 
the 89page document based largely on press reports catalogs 
continuing arrests of peaceful dissidents secret trials of 
protesters new executions and death sentences and government use 
of torture against political opponents 
it also adds a layer of criticism calling bushs reluctance to 
anger the rulers in beijing a shamefully supine policy and 
concludes the burden of trying to shape a policy that reflects 
concern for human rights still rests largely on the congress 
sources have said the state department report which has been 
sent to capitol hill but not publicly released offers a 
matteroffact recitation of abuses by the beijing government 
throughout 1989 including terming the june 4 tiananmen square 
killings a massacre 
it describes the government of deng xiaoping as a totalitarian 
regime that has tightened its grip on information and throttled 
opposing ideologies while restricting foreign travel and 
suppressing labor and religious groups sources said 
the asia watch report said between 10000 and 30000 people 
remain jailed because of prodemocracy activities the recent 
lifting of martial law in beijing has little significance if 
viewed as anything other than a public relations exercise the 
report contends 
arrests have continued largely in secret right through to 
the present and reports of continued executions persist the 
report said most of those detained have not been charged or tried 
and their families are not told where the prisoners are being held 
it said 
when they are tried verdicts are usually decided upon before 
the trial even begins it said torture of prisoners is common 
and at least 40 people have been executed in connection with the 
events of last june it added 
chinas criminal justice system is among the most deeply 
flawed in the world the report said indeed it is essentially 
premodern 
to sum up it said the continuing arrests and executions 
in china form the cutting edge of a protracted governmentled 
campaign of punitive repression and they serve a purely political 
purpose

the worlds first recipient of a device 
that works like a lung died early today 4 days after surgeons 
implanted the mechanism 
lds hospital spokesman tim madden said the teenage girl who 
received the experimental intravascular oxygenator a slender 
20inch bundle of hollow synthetic fibers that delivers oxygen to 
the body died at 530 am 
he said he could provide no other details immediately 
the device designed for temporary use to allow the lungs to 
rest and recover was implanted in a major vein during two hours 
of surgery friday in a girl with acute respiratory failure 
she reportedly was a 16yearold from texas but her parents had 
asked that no details about their daughter or her condition be made 
public 
it was unclear how long doctors had planned to leave the device 
inside the girl food and drug administration guidelines limit 
implants to seven days and madden had said any use beyond a week 
would require further fda permission 
lds hospital is one of four medical centers authorized by the 
fda for clinical testing of the ivox the others are hershey 
medical center at pennsylvania state university the university of 
michigan medical center in ann arbor and the los angeles 
countyuniversity of southern california medical center 
developed by salt lake citybased cardiopulmonics inc the 
device can satisfy as much as half of the bodys need for oxygen 
delivery and carbon dioxide removal 
external tubes the size of a soda straw are connected to the 
device one tube delivers oxygen from a hospital system or oxygen 
tank the other tube removes carbon dioxide from the body

secretary of state james a baker iii opened talks 
here tonight determined to find out whether soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev still has firm authority to negotiate 
agreements on arms control afghanistan and other issues 
baker also expects to receive a soviet response to bushs 
proposal for a ceiling of 195000 on us and soviet troops in 
central europe he said he would not be surprised if gorbachev 
called for deeper cuts 
and on german reunification baker acknowledged it may not be 
as gradual as we anticipated baker said he expected east germany 
to work on legal and other steps with west germany after holding 
national elections in midmarch 
baker declined to speculate on gorbachevs authority in the wake 
of a communist party central committee meeting that abolished the 
partys constitutional guarantee of political power 
at the outset at least bakers plans were unaffected by the 
central committees action 
that move taken at gorbachevs behest left open the question 
whether the authority he derives from the post of party 
generalsecretary will be trimmed as a result 
ask me that question after i spend two days with mr gorbachev 
and mr eduard a shevardnadze and then i would be doing a lot 
more than just guessing baker told reporters on the flight from 
prague 
baker arrived in the soviet capital from prague czechoslovakia 
where he said in a speech that the united states wants leaders at a 
proposed 35nation summit meeting this year to enshrine free 
elections as a fundamental human right 
in his moscow talks baker intends to take up with the foreign 
minister and then with gorbachev on friday issues that must be 
resolved in order to complete a treaty to reduce us and soviet 
longrange nuclear missiles in time to be signed at a washington 
summit in the second half of june 
baker also will take up ways to try to end the 11year war in 
afghanistan between the sovietbacked marxist government and 
usarmed moslem rebels 
tass said his discussions would touch on questions of a 
militarypolitical character connected with completing work this 
year on an agreement to cut strategic attack weapons of the united 
states and soviet union by 50 percent 
in his prague speech baker said the united states the soviet 
union canada and the 32 countries of europe also should join in 
sending observers to monitor upcoming balloting in warsaw pact 
countries to ensure that people power elections of 1990 genuinely 
represent the will of the people 
let me be clear he said in a speech at charles university 
in prague the peaceful transition to democracy now under way in 
central and eastern europe will not tolerate rear guard maneuvers 
from any quarter 
before the speech baker went to wenceslas square the citys 
commercial center and placed a wreath at the statue of king 
wenceslas the monarch who brought christianity to bohemia 
a crowd of a few hundred watched the ceremony quietly nearby is 
a circular flower bed which has been turned into a shrine to honor 
the student martyr jan palach a victim of the soviet suppression 
of the 1968 prague spring uprising 
baker delivered the speech in magna aluh the ceremonial great 
hall of the university after entering in a processional with 
gowned deans and professors 
the nearly 650yearold university was a rallying point for 
prodemocracy forces that overthrew the communist order in 
december czechoslovaks who have not voted in a free election 
since the communists took power in 1948 are preparing for 
balloting june 8 
baker also unveiled a us support plan for czechoslovakia that 
would knock down us barriers to its exports but provide no direct 
economic aid to the leaders of its velvet revolution 
they are not asking for a handout one us official said 
referring to the new czech leaders responsible for the countrys 
smooth transition from hardline communism 
endorsing gorbachevs call for the 35nation summit meeting 
baker said its agenda should include making free elections a human 
rights obligation under the 1975 helsinki agreement 
the spirit of revolution needs to move from the street into 
the government he said transitional regimes need to give way 
to fair and free elections that establish open parliaments with a 
place for opposition the new democratic political system needs to 
respect the rule of law and fundamental individual rights and 
liberties 
in addition to knocking down trade barriers with czechoslovakia 
baker said the bush administration was prepared to support the 
countrys request to join the international monetary fund and back 
the location of a european development bank in prague 
but he cautioned its up to you to provide a conducive legal 
environment to turn over or sell factories to private owners and 
to lift the heavy hand of excessive government intervention

the mystery of where swans go on their migratory 
flights may be unraveled with the development of a tiny transmitter 
to be attached to the birds so they can be tracked by a satellite 
the wild bird society of japan and the telecommunications 
utility nippon telegraph and telephone corp jointly announced 
wednesday that a transmitter weighing 14 ounces will be attached 
to swans signals from the birds will be beamed to a usfrench 
environmental satellite called argos to tell scientists where the 
swans are 
the first satellites will be attached this spring to four swans 
in hokkaido the northernmost japanese island the satellites will 
tell scientists the flight path swans use to reach their arctic 
summer homes 
larger transmitters have been used in recent years to track 
migrations of dolphins and seals but they were too heavy for the 
12pound swans to carry in flight

ruth trabelsi says she wants to enter the 
garden of eden with both feet but doctors say she will die of 
gangrene if her right foot is not amputated in a case 
unprecedented in israel a judge has been asked to decide whether 
mrs trabelsi must be forced to have surgery 
the 84yearold womans case has captured israelis attention 
and been widely covered by newspapers and staterun radio stations 
even the nations leading rabbis have become involved in a public 
debate on whether jewish law dictates that her life should be saved 
social workers from the israeli welfare ministry question 
whether mrs trabelsi fully understands the consequences of 
refusing surgery and took the case to court under a law requiring 
the state to protect citizens who may not be responsible for 
themselves 
doctors at poriah hospital in the northern galilee town of 
tiberias insist that without the amputation mrs trabelsi will die 
slowly and painfully from the spreading decay in her foot which 
developed after earlier surgery 
judge oded gershon of nazareth district court met in his 
chambers wednesday with doctors lawyers and several of mrs 
trabelsis 258 children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren he 
was expected to make a decision thursday 
israel radio quoted gershon as asking poriah hospitals chief 
surgeon dr amos mazor how long do i have to decide 
i hope you have another day or two but im not sure mazor 
reportedly replied every passing hour without amputation is 
worsening mrs trabelsis situation 
what do you want from her shes 84 let her die in honor as 
she chooses said the womans son eliahu trabelsi 
but other family members said the court should force mrs 
trabelsi to have surgery the radio said 
mrs trabelsi did not attend the court hearing 
dr yaacov farbstein the director of poriah hospital told the 
associated press in a telephone interview that mrs trabelsi was 
hospitalized and is conscious and stable 
he said she developed the infection in her foot about a month 
ago after surgery at another hospital for a muscular problem 
we see it as a passive suicide and i would like the court to 
answer this question whether we can leave a patient to make a 
passive suicide farbstein said 
mazor agreed saying in a radio interview an 80yearold 
woman also has time ahead of her 
we dont know whether its five years or 10 but we shouldnt 
be the ones to help her shorten her life he said 
judge gershon ordered a psychiatrist and geriatric specialist to 
visit mrs trabelsi to determine whether she was lucid enough to 
understand her decision the radio said 
the courts decision could be a landmark ruling for israel on 
the righttodie issue similar petitions to shut off life support 
systems of terminally ill patients have been rejected by the courts 
in the past 
some of mrs trabelsis grandchildren have appealed to the 
nations top rabbis to persuade her to have the amputation arguing 
that her decision was based on religious faith 
i want to enter the garden of eden with both feet mrs 
trabelsi reportedly told them tuesday in explaining her decision 
but rabbis were divided on the question rabbi israel lau head 
rabbi of the ashkanazi or european community in tel aviv said 
jewish law was unequivocal that a doctors decision to amputate 
in a lifethreatening situation must be honored 
rabbi eliahu bakshi doron haifas head sephardi clergyman 
religious leader of middle eastern and african jews suggested that 
religious law was not so clear 
only if it is absolute that she would die immediately should a 
decision on amputation be forced doron told the national itim 
news agency

some universities are returning to more 
traditional curricula but brown university believes its 
muchmaligned 20year experiment in studentguided education has 
been a resounding success and is here to stay 
the schools practice of setting students free to pursue their 
academic interests in a loosely structured environment which the 
university has said produces a betterrounded graduate has been 
derided by education experts and by national publications 
but a study released tuesday concludes that while some 
modifications are needed brown has been wellserved by the 
curriculum it established 20 years ago 
when browns current curriculum was adopted for the 196970 
school year it was seen as a radical departure from the 
traditional method of setting core requiremnts of courses that 
students are required to take 
brown instead encouraged and required students to set off on a 
path of their own 
brown sought to break the lockstep of the conventional 
curriculum and induce students and faculty to share the 
responsibility for shaping the educational experience said the 
report released tuesday 
the approach is still controversial but it has produced 
wellrounded students who go on to obtain postgraduate degrees in 
unusually high numbers and who strongly support its methods the 
report concluded 
on balance it has been a resounding success both for 
browns students and its faculty said the report prepared by 
university dean sheila e blumstein 
not all have agreed with that assessment brown is glam and 
flash the new republic concluded in a june 1986 cover story 
evaluating the schools curriculum 
brown is unconcerned with the criticism of the past because its 
nearly yearlong study found that its courses achive the 
universitys goal of a wellrounded education blumstein said 
theres been a growing trend to go exactly in the opposite 
direction she said what were showing is on balance our 
students have been very responsible in how they used the 
curriculum so they provide for themselves a broad general 
education 
she and university president vartan gregorian who ordered the 
study know that brown has been accused of being lax but they said 
that is unfair criticism people have confused flexibility and 
rigor she said you can be both flexible and rigorous 
john c hoy president of the new england board of higher 
education said he was not surprised that brown judged its program 
a success 
for brown it clearly has been a successful program he 
said the younger alumni that i have a chance to meet reflect on 
it that way they themselves attest to how valuable it was 
however it is not perfect blumstein quickly added while we 
may celebrate our successes we must also recognize our weaknesses 
shortcomings and failures and make serious efforts in developing a 
realistic set of priorities and actions for the future she wrote 
in her report 
specifically she recommended the following major changes in 
curriculum 
improving general education for various reasons the 
program did not fulfill the goals of general education as 
envisioned by the 1969 reforms the report said 
encouraging more students to study science especially those 
students who are not majoring in the sciences 
relieving pressures on certain courses particularly the social 
sciences where larger enrollments are severely stretching 
instructional resources 
improving academic advising 
reconsidering the number of majors or concentrations as 
brown describes them offered compared to a number of other ivy 
league institutions that it surveyed brown offers many more 
disciplines blumstein said while we have 83 concentration 
programs the next highest number of ivy league programs is 58 
she said 
hoy said blumsteins report appeared to be on the mark although 
he had not read it curriculum is the most intimate reflection of 
an intellectual community that a college reveals he said 
that theyre looking at revising it today seems to me to make 
sense

francisco bay area where the median price was 260600 orange 
county calif 247900 and los angeles 217000 boston had the 
highest price tag on the east coast 183600 
the median price means half of the homes cost more and half 
less the survey covered existing singlefamily detached homes 
townhouses condominiums and cooperatives

the northeasts median price stalled in the fourth quarter 
rising only 09 percent to 144000 the west had the largest gain 
9 percent to 141600 
realtors president norman d flynn cited the smaller urban 
markets as the ones offering both moderately priced housing and a 
strong diverse economic base 
affordable homes within a reasonable commute make these cities 
a prime target for companies looking to expand or relocate flynn 
said 
sales of existing homes which were weak earlier in the year 
perked up as mortgage rates fell from their march peak into the 
single digits 
john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist said interest 
rate declines during the fall produced acrosstheboard sales 
increases in the fourth quarter 
nationally sales were up 21 percent over the third quarter to 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 385 million units sales for 
the year however were off 43 percent to 378 million units 
the west was the fastest growing market as the year ended 
posting an 82 percent increase to an annual rate of 660000 units 
for the octoberdecember period 
it was followed by a sales gain of 28 percent to 145 million 
units in the south and a 1 percent advance to 104 million 
units in the midwest 
sales slumped in much of the northeast where they were off 26 
percent to 701000 units at an annual rate for the quarter for the 
year sales declined 118 percent to 741000 units 
twentynine states posted sales increases over the third 
quarter ranging from 09 percent in hawaii to 305 percent in 
vermont 
flynn said the 1990 housing market is expected to be much like 
1989 strong in some areas average in others and sluggish in 
parts of the nation where the economy is weak

a little more than half of the high school 
students surveyed on their knowledge of geography gave correct 
responses to questions about key countries and physical and 
cultural features of the world the nations report card said today 
in its first study of geography education the national 
assessment of educational progress popularly known as the 
nations report card said most students demonstrated a limited 
understanding of the characteristics of the planet earth and the 
relationships between people and their environment 
more than 3000 12thgrade students from about 300 public and 
private schools participated in the survey conducted from january 
through may of the 198788 school year 
an average of 57 percent of the students gave correct responses 
overall to questions that dealt with the location of key countries 
and physical and cultural features of the world the survey showed 
geography is not a priority in most schools said the study it 
pointed to a recent survey of the council of chief state school 
officers that found only 18 percent of the states required 
geography for graduation 
when it is taught geography is often integrated into other 
courses such as history social studies and science said the 
report the geography learning of highschool seniors 
geography appeared to play neither a major nor a consistent 
role in students highschool coursetaking experience said the 
study 
geography coursetaking per se was not associated with 
achievement a finding that was consistent across most subgroups 
of the population 
less than twothirds of the students surveyed reported taking a 
geography course at any grade in high school but 83 percent 
indicated they had studied in other courses the location of 
continents oceans rivers mountains states cities countries 
and cultures 
on a world map 87 percent identified canada 85 percent 
recognized the soviet union 84 percent correctly identified 
countries in the middle east 72 percent identified petroleum 
exporting countries and 71 percent successfully located latin 
america 
but only 37 percent were able to locate southeast asia and 37 
percent incorrectly responded that india is part of southeast asia 
thirteen percent said that either saudi arabia or brazil are part 
of this cultural region 
naep is a congressionally mandated project of the national 
center for education statistics at the department of education it 
is the only nationally representative and continuing assessment of 
what american students know and can do in various subject areas

is particularly fond of shooting out pictures of longhorns 
i take a pencil and sketch out a design on a sheet of 
cardboard sutton said then i set the cardboard on a sheet of 
copper and shoot out all the dots around the picture 
sutton 41 got the idea from boyhood memories he said tuesday 
he recalled seeing a gun salesman shooting out designs with a 
winchester 
im sure he never intended it to be framed and sold sutton

since seattle is known as the emerald city 
maybe tacoma should dump its longtime motto as the city of destiny 
and become known as the sapphire city says mayor karen vialle 
vialle said shes had enough of a smokestack image and 
embarrassing aroma of tacoma themes in national news reports 
i think we need to come up with another city motto vialle 
said earlier this week in our efforts to enhance our image we 
need to come up with something that plays to our attributes she 
didnt mention any specific plans for the change 
the idea of sapphire was brought up by a psychology professor 
last summer 
christine hansvick of pacific lutheran university said she 
found a largely negative selfimage of the city and that residents 
identified with gray 
she suggested the sapphire a blue gemstone as an antidote 
you can see the image wherever you look she said we have 
blue skies blue waters and a dome with a blue roof referring to 
the tacoma dome arena 
abandoning the city of destiny a motto attributed to new york 
newspaper columnist george francis train during the railroad boom 
in 1886 would show the communitys determination to project a 
fresher face she said 
brian kamens of the tacoma public librarys northwest 
collection said the city also had been known over the years as 
mistress of the sea portal of the pacific city of fine homes and 
lumber capital of the world 
a contest in 1981 resulted in a switch of seattles nickname 
from queen city to emerald city 
a topquality emerald can cost 9000 and an equivalent sapphire 
about 6000 said jane horowitz a buyer for the ben bridge 
jewelry store chain

virginias instant background check on gun 
buyers is working better than firearms dealers expected according 
to a state report 
under the program which began nov 1 nearly 11000 gun 
purchases were approved and 130 or 1 percent were rejected 
because the buyer had a criminal record said state secretary of 
public safety robert l suthard 
this program has operated in the manner intended suthard 
said in a report issued tuesday if the program had not been 
implemented there would be 130 weapons in the hands of persons the 
general assembly deems unqualified 
the law first of its kind in nation requires gun dealers to 
call state police on a tollfree telephone number each time a state 
resident tries to buy certain firearms the average time to obtain 
an approval was less than 90 seconds the report said outofstate 
buyers must wait for approval by mail 
firearms dealers appear to be generally satisfied with the 
program the report said a survey of the states gun dealers 
found that 65 percent said the program worked better than they 
expected 18 percent said it was worse and 17 percent said it was 
about what they expected 
gun dealers collect a 2 fee from virginia residents and a 5 
fee from outofstate residents for each police records check but 
the report said the fees have not covered the cost of the records 
checks because the number of gun purchases has been fewer than 
estimated 
pending legislation would raise the fees to 5 and 10 
sen moody e stallings who sponsored the gun law said he has 
been contacted by eight to 10 states interested in enacting similar 
laws 
the law covers the purchases of handguns with a barrel length of 
less than 5 inches or semiautomatic weapons that hold more than 20 
rounds or accommodate a silencer or bayonet

a teenage girl died this morning 4 days 
after becoming the worlds first recipient of an implanted device 
that works like a lung 
lds hospital spokesman tim madden said melicia harvey 16 of 
arthur city texas died of pulmonary failure at 530 am the 
experimental intravascular oxygenator a 20inch bundle of hollow 
synthetic fibers that delivers oxygen to the blood functioned as 
intended until the girls death madden said 
miss harvey had been in critical condition throughout the 
experiment with severe respiratory distress syndrome which results 
from a variety of causes and is characterized by inability of the 
lungs to transfer oxygen to the blood 
the ivox approved for use for up to a week to allow damaged 
lungs to rest and recover was implanted during two hours of 
surgery friday 
miss harvey whose father atrell harvey ii is employed by the 
campbell soup co had been a member of the student council at 
north lamar high school in paris texas the paris news reported 
the girls mother edith died jan 31 of undisclosed causes 
suffice it to say the family has gone through extensive 
tragedy during the past week madden said 
linda bolton a secretary at the high school said students were 
taking miss harveys death really really hard 
we have 740 students at the high school here so all our 
students are close they all know each other she said she said 
counselors had been called in to talk with students who included 
miss harveys brother and sister 
the ivox which is inserted via the neck or groin into the 
inferior vena cava the large vein that brings blood to the heart 
has received food and drug administration approval for up to 10 
experimental implants in humans with no better than a 10 percent 
chance of survival 
the inchwide ivox bundle of fibers is connected to external 
tubes the size of a soda straw one tube delivers oxygen from a 
hospital system or oxygen tank the other tube removes carbon 
dioxide from the body a waste product of breathing 
the only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an 
extra corporeal oxygenator a large machine that requires pumping 
the blood outside the body 
there were no clinical complications from the use of the 
device madden said in a statement it was unclear how long 
doctors had planned to leave the device inside the girl fda 
guidelines limit the implants to seven days 
doctors emphasized the ivox is not an artificial lung but a 
lungassist device capable of satisfying half the bodys need 
for oxygen and for carbondioxide removal but they said it could 
lead someday to an artificial lung 
the inventor dr jd mortensen of cardiopulmonics inc in salt 
lake city said initial experiments will involve only patients with 
acute lung disease such as pneumonia or smoke inhalation not 
chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema 
lds hospital is one of four medical centers authorized by the 
fda for testing of the ivox the others are hershey medical center 
at pennsylvania state university the university of michigan 
medical center in ann arbor and the los angeles countyuniversity 
of southern california medical center

sen dave durenberger received loans totaling 
nearly 1 million from commercial state bank of st paul without 
collateral and at very low interest from 1979 through 1988 the 
star tribune reported today 
durenberger denied any impropriety 
durenbergers personal finances are under investigation by the 
senate ethics committee and the loan information could open a new 
avenue of inquiry durenberger did not fully disclose some of the 
loans as required by senate rules the newspaper said 
the minnesota republicans cousin jack is a vice president in 
the banks commercial lending section but the senators staff said 
today that jack durenberger had nothing to do with the loans 
he had absolutely no involvement in any of the loan 
transactions for the senator the senators press secretary 
carrie collins told the associated press 
durenberger received 23 loans most not backed by collateral 
totaling 927078 from the bank after entering the senate in 1978 
the newspaper reported 
the interest rates on many of the loans through 1981 were so low 
that industry experts suggested they may not have been profitable 
for the bank the star tribune said 
about half the 23 loans were below the prime lending rate banks 
traditionally give their most valued customers 
bank officials said the loans were routine for a good customer 
six banking experts contacted by the star tribune said many of 
the loans appeared to be outside standard banking practices 
the loan history doesnt make any sense from a bankers point 
of view said michael pint a former state banking commissioner 
pint and other experts who commented on the loans werent told 
the identity of the bank or the name of the borrower but knew it 
was a political figure the newspaper said 
if it happened at my bank heads would roll said jim 
burkholder chief operating officer of investors savings bank in 
minneapolis its not prudent to do that and based on what 
ive seen it appears it smacks of seeking to influence a public 
official 
you just dont make loans like that because they are losers 
said pint president of central financial services and former chief 
finance officer of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis 
bert mckasy durenbergers chief of staff provided details of 
the loans to the star tribune and set up an interview with 
commercial states president 
mckasy said durenberger did nothing wrong in obtaining the loans 
and simply took the best interest rate available 
bank officials said they gave the loans to durenberger because 
he was a good customer and because they hoped he might return to 
minnesota after leaving office and promote the bank to his friends 
bank officials said they never contacted durenberger for help in 
his official role 
we feel our relationship was absolutely above board it was a 
very typical relationship said bank chairman victor reim 
bank president richard kastner said commercial state was never 
at risk 
durenberger who refused to be interviewed provided a written 
statement outlining his relationship with the bank he called reim 
a close friend and said he began banking at commercial in 1975 
i never asked for any special consideration from the bank and 
dont believe i was ever extended any durenberger said

state officials say theyre not sure how 
to respond to an appeals court ruling that segregation still 
affects mississippis public universities because they cant 
mandate where students will go to school 
how to integrate the universities in mississippi is a question 
beyond me its very complicated a very thornytype issue said 
state college board member sidney rushing of gulfport you cant 
force students to attend 
gov ray mabus said wednesday that many education reforms being 
considered by lawmakers would improve conditions at all the 
colleges but declined to comment directly on the courts action 
there are still areas in which we need to work harder and we 
have made progress 
the governor said the universities would benefit from improved 
literacy programs and other measures to improve the quality and 
quantity of high school graduates 
the 21 decision tuesday by a 5th us circuit court of appeals 
panel in new orleans overturned a lower court ruling in a lawsuit 
by blacks over policies at mississippis five historically white 
and three historically black universities 
the court sent the case back to us district judge neal b 
biggers jr who had dismissed the lawsuit in 1987 declaring 
mississippis university system sufficiently desegregated 
historically white southern mississippi delta state 
mississippi state mississippi university for women and the 
university of mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over 
historically black alcorn state jackson state and mississippi 
valley state universities the panel ruled 
more than 99 percent of the states 26953 white college 
students were enrolled in historically white institutions during 
the 198586 school year while 71 percent of 12826 black students 
were enrolled in historically black schools the court said 
house speaker tim ford and others argue the legislature tries to 
promote integration and to equitably fund all eight universities 
i dont see what else we can do other than mandating where 
people can go ford said 
mississippi spent an average 1351 in 1960 and 8516 in 1986 
per student enrolled at historically white institutions the 
average at historically black schools was 718 in 1960 and 6038 
in 1986 the court said 
legislators say little new money can be squeezed out of the 
overburdened state budget 
appeals court judges irving goldberg and sam d johnson said the 
black colleges are still inferior and there remains in 
mississippis higher educational system vestiges of discrimination 
which distort the perceptions of black students 15 years after a 
lawsuit was filed against the higher education system 
there is no formal plan for desegregating the eight 
universities although presidents are encouraged to strive for a 
racially mixed enrollment by recruiting blacks and whites 
if the state of mississippi continues with its tradition it 
will delay any changes as long as possible said state sen doug 
anderson chairman of the senate universities and colleges 
committee what we do know is at the predominantly white 
institutions there is very little black faculty and there is also 
the discriminatory way appropriations have been made to 
predominantly black institutions historically theyve received 
fewer dollars and less attractive new programs 
this case is very important to the survival of black 
institutions right now the lowest salaries the worst facilities 
are at predominantly black institutions 
the college board can ask the threemember panel of the court to 
reconsider the ruling or ask the full 15member court to take up 
the case 
college board attorney bill goodman of jackson said he is sure 
the ruling will be considered by the full court id rather do my 
talking in the courtroom he said declining further comment 
state rep aaron henry president of the mississippi naacp 
appealed to students and administrators of traditionally 
whitedominated schools to be more accepting of black students 
racism is americas no 1 problem this ruling about 
mississippi gives a true portrait of mississippi but in any other 
state the ruling could have been the same said henry 
in his dissent judge john duhe said mississippi had fulfilled 
its legal obligation to open its universities to all students 
regardless of race 
the lawsuit was filed in 1975 by jake ayers of glen allen on 
behalf of his son jake ayers jr a high school student and 20 
other black students the younger ayers later attended junior 
college but dropped out to join the air force 
ayers widow lillian ayers said she has another son who will 
graduate from high school this year 
hopefully he will benefit from the change mrs ayers said

bowing to protests from 
preservationists the county has backed away from a plan to build a 
boxlike jail that would have blocked a view of the only government 
building designed by frank lloyd wright 
the marin county board of supervisors on tuesday agreed to 
consider burying the jail in a hillside next to the wrightdesigned 
civic center 
supervisors made the decision after being told by the california 
preservation foundation that they would live with their mistake 
forever because the world will not let you forget 
the alternative plan would be similar to one rejected by voters 
two years ago when they turned down a halfcent sales tax to 
finance an underground jail 
the civic center on which ground was broken in 1960 was 
wrights last commission before his death in 1959 at age 92 the 
threestory center with its long rows of crescentshaped arches 
low dome and spire is a landmark for residents and motorists 
the county is under court order to replace or expand its 
overcrowded 110bed jail a 22yearold building in san rafael it 
also is running out of time to qualify for 10 million in state 
jailimprovement funds 
about 150 people who came together under the banner of save our 
civic center argued at the meeting that a jail could compromise 
the centers eventual designation as a national landmark and would 
destroy a major work of art 
board chairman robert roumiguiere instructed the county planning 
staff to bring the underground proposal back for consideration in 
60 days

there is no clear evidence that the 1986 tax 
overhaul which killed a special break for capital gains reduced 
the level of investment in the united states the treasury 
department told congress on wednesday 
president bush has made restoration of the capital gains break a 
major initiative of his administration contending its necessary 
to increase investment 
at a house ways and means committee hearing on the impact of the 
1986 law kenneth w gideon assistant secretary of the treasury 
for tax policy said skeptics had predicted investment would 
decline and that growth of key industries would be stymied 
the predicted shortrun decrease in aggregate equipment 
investment has apparently failed to materialize gideon said 
such investment has actually experienced a post1986act surge as 
a result of technologydriven increases and expenditures on office 
computing and accounting machinery and an increased growth in 
output demanded by other sectors of the economy 
it could be that investment might have been higher without the 
act which also ended a special credit for investment while 
reducing the corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent or 
it may be too soon to judge gideon said 
in any case there is no clear evidence that the 1986 act 
affected the level of investment gideon said 
nevertheless gideon and internal revenue service commissioner 
fred t goldberg jr renewed the administrations plea for cutting 
capital gains taxes 
in order to remain competitive incentives for savings and 
investment must be improved gideon said 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill said the 
administration was offering the wrong solution 
until the deficit can be significantly reduced no tax system 
crafted by congress will cure the economic ills of this country 
while the passage of special tax breaks will only create more 
economic distortions he said 
capital gains profits from the sale of stock and other 
investments are fully taxed at the same rates applying to wages 
and other income bush has proposed exempting up to 30 percent of 
gains from taxation 
while rostenkowski repeated that he will resist any cut in 
capital gains taxes he said the committee will always consider how 
to make the tax system simpler 
the need for more simplification was the central theme of most 
witnesses who testified wednesday 
we are imposing an unacceptable burden on taxpayers and our 
system of tax administration goldberg said 
rep bill archer of texas senior republican on the committee 
and a foe of the 1986 overhaul said the new law imposed layers of 
complexity even while advocates were proclaiming it as 
simplification 
as a lawyer and member of this committee for 17 years i have 
always prided myself on doing my own tax return archer said 
last year i could not do it 
among other judgments on the 1986 act 
proposals to restore a capital gains break threaten the new 
law said robert s mcintyre director of citizens for tax justice 
a laborbacked research organization tax reform is working at 
least for now he said the question facing congress today is 
whether reform will be saved or scuttled 
the tradeoff of certain credits and deductions for lower 
statutory rates has contributed to overall efficiency in the 
allocation of capital resources and thus had a positive effect on 
economic growth said harry sullivan senior vice president of 
the food marketing institute speaking for a coalition that 
includes 100 of the fortune 500 corporations 
while praising the law for removing 6 million lowerincome 
people from the tax rolls william lucy secretarytreasurer of the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees said 
its passage led many states into illadvised tax cuts resulting in 
reduced services for citizens 
don fuqua president of aerospace industries association of 
america said the law by eliminating a special accounting method 
makes it more difficult for longterm contractors to compete and 
threatens efforts to keep this nation a leader in technological 
development 
michael j miller of the independent petroleum association of 
america said that because of a reduction of tax benefits the 1986 
law is having a severe impact on an already depressed industry

high school students have agreed to end 
a fiveday boycott of the school cafeteria which cost the schools 
food services company up to 3500 after the company offered to 
give 1000 a year in scholarships 
students at apponequet regional high school launched the boycott 
in response to a 10 percent increase in the price of a la carte 
items such as pizza hot dogs and ice cream prices were raised to 
pay for spoiled food and cleanup costs associated with a freezer 
that broke down undetected during a weekend in december 
the feeling of the kids is that we dont feel we should have 
to pay for something that is not in our control there should have 
been someone there when the freezer broke student council 
president beth brooks said 
the price increase remains but students will get seven days 
notice of any new increases said peter w babbitt aras district 
manager 
in addition they will be more involved in the monthly review 
process of food service operations he said he could not say 
exactly what form that involvement would take however 
and the company based in philadelphia will offer two 500 
scholarships to graduating seniors starting this year babbitt said 
students voted tuesday to discontinue the boycott most of the 
schools 800 students had refused to eat in the cafeteria 
babbitt said the boycott cost ara between 600 and 700 a day 
he expected sales to return to normal starting thursday 
ara services had asked the freetownlakeville regional school 
committee to approve the 10 percent price increase last month to 
offset a 2800 food loss caused by the broken freezer ara 
services also claimed an additional 2600 in labor costs for 
cleanup for a total 5400 loss

the insurance industry called wednesday for 
federal help in the wake of last falls california earthquake 
saying it would be unable to bear the costs of a major tremor 
insurers cannot finance a catastrophic earthquake franklin 
w nutter chairman of an insurance industry coalition on quake 
dangers told a house banking subcommittee on insurance 
while it is not possible to predict insured losses from all 
events at all locations it is safe to say that the earthquake 
peril presents the industry with a loss of catastrophic 
proportions said john p drennan a vice president of allstate 
insurance co 
there is a nationwide threat of earthquakes said arch c 
johnston of the center for earthquake research and information at 
memphis state university 
a major destructive earthquake in the eastern united states is 
the quintessential example of the lowprobabilityhighconsequence 
event that invites complacency and defeats mitigation efforts it 
is also the nightmare of the insurance industry johnston said 
the longterm solution to quake damage is to design and build 
tremorresistant buildings grant c peterson of the federal 
emergency management agency told the subcommittee but he said his 
agency is studying possible lossreduction provisions that could be 
included in a federal insurance program if one is developed 
drennan said that if the 1906 san francisco quake ocurred today 
insured losses would total at least 34 billion and a repeat of 
the 181112 tremor at new madrid mo would mean paying 17 
billion 
nutter however estimated insured quake claims in another 1906 
san francisco quake could climb to 135 billion with billions 
more in fire losses and bodily injury claims 
nutter proposed establishing a federal earthquake insurance 
program similar to the governments flood insurance backed by 
federal money but administered by private companies 
any federal insurance program must include requirements that 
efforts be made to reduce quake damage said george bernstein of 
the national earthquake hazards review program 
insurance is an efficient way to reimburse people for their 
losses bernstein testified but without hazard mitigation the 
guaranty of compensation from insurance will also create an 
incentive for irresponsible construction in disregard of known 
earthquake hazards 
the flood insurance program imposes requirements for house 
siting and strengthening to reduce damage he said 
the earthquake risk may be different but the principle is the 
same 
paying billions of dollars in claims could reduce insurance 
company funds to the point where they might have to stop issuing 
new policies nutter said adding that if companies were forced to 
sell investments to pay claims there could be a severe decline in 
the stock and bond markets 
nutter proposed establishing a federal corporation that would 
organize earthquake coverage investing premiums in government 
bonds as a surplus to pay any claims 
if the surplus were not sufficient federal borrowing authority 
would be available he said 
nutter also urged that homeowners whose mortgages were federally 
insured or held by federally insured institutions be required to 
have earthquake insurance that would widen the base of premiums 
lowering average cost and increasing the surplus available he said

conservative republican lawmakers on wednesday 
questioned the impact on business of legislation guaranteeing the 
rights of the disabled 
rep tom delay rtexas and chairman of the republican study 
committee task force on competitiveness said that he and his 
colleagues were concerned that the americans with disabilities act 
may be moving too quickly through congress to explore the impact 
it will have on our businesses on our judicial system and on our 
nations productivity as a whole 
equal employment opportunity commissioner evan j kemp jr told 
delays group that president bush knows the issues he knows 
everything backwards and forwards in this area and fully supports 
the legislation 
kemp said more than 8 million disabled americans could be 
brought into the work force through the employmentprotection 
provisions of the law saving the government 300 billion in 
welfare and other payments 
the bill is also intended to ensure that the nations 43 million 
disabled people have full access to shops restaurants lodging and 
other public accommodations 
kemp was one of several witnesses at a task force hearing on the 
legislation which the senate passed in september on a 768 vote 
the bill has since cleared one of the four house committees with 
jurisdiction and is expected to be passed by the full chamber this 
year 
critics particularly smallbusiness interests and bus 
operators contend that definitions in the law are vague and that 
its costs are immeasurable 
carolyn l weaver a resident scholar at the conservative 
american enterprise institute said the act would raise labor 
costs inhibit job formation and possibly lead to an undesirable 
distribution of gainers and losers 
the proposed legislation would phase in employmentrights 
provisions over three years but exempt businesses with 15 or fewer 
employees the legislation requires all businesses to provide 
reasonable accommodation to disabled patrons unless those 
adjustments would create an undue hardship

the rev jesse jackson arrived 
wednesday for talks with south african leaders and said he hoped to 
see nelson mandela freed and walking down the streets of 
johannesburg before he leaves 
jackson gave a thumbsup sign as he arrived at the airport for 
his 12day visit ignoring shouts from a handful of white 
rightwingers who shouted jesse go home 
he was protected by two lines of black and white policeman a 
black man started a brief chorus of welcome jesse among black 
airport workers lining the balconies 
jackson granted a visa for the first time since his 1979 visit 
said he hoped to encourage unity among black political factions and 
to address the unfounded fears of the whites 
the american civil rights leader plans to meet president fw de 
klerk foreign minister pik botha and leaders of the antiapartheid 
movement he and his wife jackie were greeted at the airport by 
african national congress leader walter sisulu his wife 
albertina and church leaders rev allan boesak and frank chikane 
this is a moment in south africas history that must be 
seized jackson said if the government moves back there will 
be chaos if it stands still there will be tension but if the 
government seizes the political moment and moves forward we will 
see the dawn of a new free and democratic south africa 
jackson declined to say whether he had requested a meeting with 
mandela the anc leader who is expected to be released soon after 
more than 27 years in prison 
i have no commitment from the government to meet him 
jackson said i hope to see him walking down the streets of 
johannesburg the whole world hopes to see him free 
in cape town the proapartheid conservative party vowed to 
stage white protests and strikes to drive de klerk from office and 
block his plans to share power with the black majority 
koos van der merwe chief spokesman for the conservatives the 
main white opposition party said de klerk deceived whites last 
week by suddenly legalizing the african national congress guerrilla 
movement and more than 60 other antiapartheid groups 
he said de klerk promised during the september election not to 
deal with the anc until it abandoned violence we will keep the 
pressure on him until he has no choice but to call a general 
election van der merwe said 
under the constitution which de klerk wants to replace with one 
produced in negotiations with blacks the president has the sole 
power to call a parliamentary election but if large numbers of 
whites joined a general strike they could bring the government to 
a standstill halt most transportation and close businesses 
schools and hospitals 
the conservative party promised its actions against de klerk 
would be peaceful but an extremeright nazistyle group called 
the afrikaner resistance movement which has been involved in 
violent confrontations with blacks promised to protest jacksons 
appearances throughout the country during his tour

the house approved a 42 million aid package 
for panama today that lawmakers said will help the central american 
country boost its damaged economy 
the measure which was approved by a voice vote also includes 
10 million to help newly emerging democracies in eastern europe 
prepare for elections 
rep gerald solomon rny called the 42 million a way of 
finishing the course that just cause began it combines aid 
trade and investment the pentagon dubbed the dec 20 us 
invasion of panama operation just cause 
the senate foreign relations committee has endorsed a similiar 
package for panama and the senate is expected to approve it 
shortly 
the senate finance committee today waived the normal 45day 
review period and voted unanimously to lift the trade sanctions 
imposed two years ago because of panamas involvement then in drug 
trafficking 
restoring the mostfavorednation and caribbean basin tariff 
preferences are part of identical packages approved tuesday by 
house and senate committees 
bush has said he wants to provide as much as 1 billion to 
panama and intends to introduce legislation later to funnel more 
money to the country 
several house members objected to rerouting 30 million from 
accounts for africa to panama even though the administration has 
promised to restore the money later in the year 
we are raiding the african account for the third time in 
recent years said rep mervyn dymally dcalif 
others said they want the administration to ensure panama lifts 
secrecy restrictions on its banks to prevent drug traffickers from 
laundering profits 
former president ronald reagan imposed the trade and investment 
sanctions in march 1988 as part of a us effort to drive manuel 
antonio noriega out of office as panamas leader 
we have a new regime in panama one which we expect will be 
much more cooperative than the last in helping us in the war on 
drugs said the finance committees chairman sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs told the house panel panamas economy has declined by 16 
percent over the past two years while unemployment is more than 25 
percent the countrys foreign debt has grown to 4 billion 
freezing prospects for new borrowing he said 
but he added panama is not a basket case us aid is 
intended simply to help them do what they can and wish to do for 
themselves 
the legislation would provide an immediate 125 million in cash 
and an additional 10 million in guarantees to rebuild the panama 
citys chorillo neighborhood where fires in the wake of the 
invasion left 10000 people homeless 
the measure also would provide 7 million for emergency public 
works and jobs programs 55 million to help agencies of the new 
government of president guillermo endara prepare budgets and 
reorganize and train workers 5 million to help looted businesses 
reopen their doors and 2 million to begin training a new police 
force and start up a new judiciary 
in addition the bill certifies panama is taking steps to 
cooperate with the war on drugs including combatting trafficking 
and money laundering that flourished under noriega the statement 
would permit panama to resume receiving favorable trade treatment 
and to benefit from the caribbean basin initiative and investment 
incentives aid the administration values at up to 500 million 
in the next week the administration will formally ask for an 
additional 500 million in cash aid for panama including 185 
million for the countrys banks to provide liquidity for private 
sector lending 145 million for a government program to generate 
investment and create jobs 20 million for more police training 
and judicial reform 20 million for private sector export 
promotion and 130 million toward clearing panamas debts to 
international development banks to make the country eligible for 
new lending 
meanwhile a delegation of protesters including actor edward 
asner delivered a petition to the white house today calling on 
president bush to withdraw the troops now restore sovereignty to 
panama and make reparations to the civilian victims of the us 
invasion immediately

a longorbiting satellite rescued by 
a space shuttle crew last month shows some deterioration but not 
enough to halt nasas plans for a permanent manned space station a 
project scientist said wednesday 
there is nothing here to indicate you cant proceed with the 
space station william kinard told reporters who viewed the long 
duration exposure facility in a sterile room where it is undergoing 
preliminary examination after six years in space 
kinard reported the 11ton satellite sent into orbit to 
determine how durable various materials would be in space was 
peppered with thousands perhaps as many as 10000 of tiny 
bits of space dust called micrometeoroids 
he based the estimate on a count of 40 visible hits on one small 
section of the ldef satellite the size of a small school bus he 
said the largest crater was 5 millimeters in diameter about 
onefifth of an inch 
kinard said several spacecraft materials suffered minor erosion 
from the wearing effects of atomic oxygen and ultraviolet 
radiation and that in some instances the micrometeoroid craters 
were further damaged by the introduction of these elements 
he said the crater count enabled researchers to establish a 
data base on micrometeoroid impacts in space 
because the damage was not excessive he said this should 
provide confidence for those planning to build nasas space station 
freedom with assembly of the big manned laboratory slated to start 
in orbit in 1995 
kinard said the aluminum struts which form the main body of ldef 
were very intact i would fly this spacecraft again 
aluminum will be the principal metal used in the space station 
he said the atomic oxygen erosion of other materials was about 
what we expected i dont think it is a real problem for the space 
station it just means they have to use materials not subject to 
atomic oxygen erosion especially on the leading edge 
kinard said there was some discoloration and that foil covering 
some experiments had torn 
but thats why we sent it up there to find out what happens 
to materials after a long time in the space environment kinard 
said were delighted with the condition 
ldef was retrieved from orbit on jan 12 by the crew of the 
space shuttle columbia just weeks before gravity would have tugged 
it to fiery destruction in the atmosphere 
it was brought here jan 26 and since then technicians and 
scientists have been examining it 
there are 57 experiment trays containing various test materials 
on board kinard said these will be removed starting about feb 20 
for detailed studies by principal investigators 
the first tray to be removed contains 125 million tomato seeds 
which will be distributed to students at various grades around the 
country for tests to see how they grow after so long in space

an unemployed maintenance man suspected in 
the slayings of four family members who were tied up shot and set 
afire in their home died today in a shootout with police and his 
mother was arrested authorities said 
state police said it was not clear whether 33yearold anthony 
turner who was sitting on a bed and holding a shotgun to his chin 
when police entered his apartment to arrest him killed himself or 
was slain by police gunfire 
authorities carried a warrant charging turner also known as 
michael kinge with murder in the dec 22 slayings of warren 
harris 39 his wife dolores 41 and their children ages 11 and 
15 
authorities also arrested turners mother shirley kinge 54 
and turned over to social workers a 2yearold taken from her 
apartment and believed to be turners child 
state police superintendent thomas constantine said ms kinge 
would be charged in connection with the slayings but he would not 
say what charges would be filed 
we are very relieved of course its brought a lot of emotion 
back and now its kind of a reality to me we are very relieved 
we are very excited we are very glad said pat lake of manlius 
whose husband don is a brother of mrs harris 
the harrises were tied up shot in the back of the head and 
hours later doused with fuel and set on fire in upstairs bedrooms 
at their home set far back from a road on a large wooded lot in 
this affluent ithaca suburb 
the bodies were discovered the next day after firefighters had 
put out the blaze 
police have said robbery appears the most likely motive for the 
killings mrs harris ran a country gifts and antiques store just a 
few yards from the house her husband was a sales director for an 
electronics distributor 
on the day the bodies were found a man and woman used the 
harrises credit cards to buy clothing electronics and diamonds at 
malls in suburban syracuse and auburn 
clerks at those stores helped a police artist draw sketches of 
the people who used the cards 
maj robert j farrand said the investigators focused on turner 
as the result of identifications given by people who had seen 
composite drawings released by authorities farrand said there were 
no other suspects 
turner had a long criminal history in new york city including 
convictions for burglary and theft with a deadly weapon police 
said 
turner was holding a gun to his chin when authorities entered 
said constantine the man turned toward police and fired once and 
the three officers returned fire he said constantine said an 
autopsy would be performed

blacks are twice as likely as whites to have 
vision problems that cannot be corrected with glasses according to 
a survey of more than 5300 people over age 40 
the studys authors could not explain the finding and were in 
the process of exploring what those reasons might be said james 
m tielsch coauthor of the study that appears in this months 
archives of ophthalmology 
it was conducted over a fouryear period in east baltimore a 
workingclass section and was designed to provide data typical of 
multiracial urban populations in the united states said tielsch 
an ophthalmology professors at johns hopkins wilmer eye institute 
almost 12 percent of those studied were visually impaired even 
though they wore glasses and saw an eye doctor regularly 
this translates nationally to more than 9 million people 
tielsch said tuesday 
the good news is that twothirds to threequarters of those 
were correctable that is they could move out of the visual 
impairment category just by the provision of the proper pair of 
spectacles 
the study defined impairment as vision of 2040 and legal 
blindness as vision of 20200 
the studys two principal findings were that for both visual 
impairment and for blindness at every age blacks have a higher 
proportion of people affected than whites tielsch said the 
second point is that theres a dramatic increase with increasing 
age in both the proportion of people affected from visual 
impairment and blindness 
the study found visual impairment in 22 percent of whites and 
394 percent of the blacks of the whites 043 percent were 
legally blind compared with 102 percent of blacks 
among both race the researchers projected that more than 3 
million people nationwide could see no better than 2040 even with 
the strongest glasses of those more than 890000 are legally 
blind 
the study found that in the oldest age group those over 80 
more than 25 percent were blind or visually impaired because of eye 
disease said tielsch whose coauthor was dr alfred sommer 
east baltimore was chosen because socioeconomic conditions of 
blacks and whites in the area are similar the area is poor to 
middle class and has a higher rate of rental housing than the rest 
of the city and country the study said 
we chose baltimore to serve as a model for the rest of urban 
america tielsch said 
its a credible study by a credible group they do good 
work said dr barbara klein an ophthalmology professor at the 
university of wisconsin the study was done the right way and 
from their credibility its likely to be quite true 
about 50 percent of those interviewed for the study were black 
none of the participants was a resident of a nursing home hospital 
or institution for the blind 
all the participants were given an eye examination and about 
onethird were given a complete exam at wilmer

gov james r thompson today signed 
legislation allowing riverboat gambling on the mississippi and 
illinois rivers beginning next year 
the gambling is not designed to make money for the state 
thompson said in a statement but rather help local economies by 
stimulating tourism and economic development revenues for the 
municipalities that want it 
the governor also appointed a fivemember gaming board to 
oversee the floating casinos 
supporters say the legislation will give illinois an edge over 
iowa in the race for tourism dollars riverboat gambling becomes 
legal in iowa in april 1991 
the illinois measure will provide five licenses each allowing 
two riverboats for a total of as many as eight floating casinos on 
the mississippi river and two on the illinois river beginning in 
1991 
the gaming board may issue five additional licenses for two 
riverboats each in 1992 one such license is designated for the 
des plaines river 
in signing the legislation thompson urged the legislature to 
correct what he described as minor flaws in the bill 
among the recommended changes is a 500 limit on the amount a

scores of people wounded in nine days of 
war between lebanons main christian armies are dying in hospitals 
that have no power and little blood medicine or clean water 
police said wednesday 
they said 365 people had been killed and 1682 wounded since the 
battle for supremacy began jan 30 between nearly 20000 soldiers 
commanded by rebel gen michel aoun and the lebanese forces militia 
of samir geagea which has about 6000 regulars and an estimated 
30000 reservists 
many of the victims have been civilians some of them moslems 
killed or wounded by shells that strayed out of christian territory 
on wednesday families in christian east beirut searched for 
relatives in hospitals where surgeons operated by candlelight 
police said food was so short that some people fought over bread 
in christian neighborhoods where hundreds of thousands of people 
have spent a week or more in basements or bomb shelters 
french cabinet minister bernard kouchner and rene ala the 
french ambassador arranged a 90minute truce on a single street so 
seven ambulances could take seriously wounded people from a 
hospital in the ashrafiyeh district 
snipers from both sides fired overhead as the convoy dashed to 
evacuate the wounded who included an 8monthold baby with a head 
wound they were driven to beirut airport in the moslem sector 
where a french jet took them to paris for treatment along with 
other wounded civilians 
the french foreign ministry said the plane carried 16 victims 
who were transferred to eight hospitals in paris after their 
arrival 
meanwhile mediators representing maronite patriarch nasrallah 
sfeir the highest ranking christian prelate in the christian 
enclave convened a ceasefire committee with representatives from 
the two warring factions 
christiancontrolled radio stations said the meeting lasted six 
hours there was no immediate announcement 
a police spokesman said aoun who has been dismissed as army 
commander but refuses to step aside appeared to be reorganizing 
his forces for a major drive against geageas besieged strongholds 
in the 310squaremile christian area north and east of beirut 
if aoun is successful his control of christian territory might 
be difficult to break even for the 40000 syrian soldiers in 
lebanon with whom aoun fought a sixmonth artillery war that ended 
in september 
at a news conference aoun blamed the fighting on geagea and 
claimed the united states was using the militia chieftain to force 
implementation of a peace plan designed to end lebanons 
15yearold civil war 
aoun rejects the peace plan because it does not include a 
timetable for the withdrawal of the syrian troops and he refuses 
to recognize president elias hrawi who was elected as part of the 
plan 
hrawi aoun and geagea are maronite cathlics the christian sect 
that has dominated the government army and judiciary since 
independence from france in 1943 geagea recognizes hrawi as 
president but has not taken a public position on the peace plan 
negotiated last fall at taif saudi arabia 
the trojan horse never said in public he was in favor of the 
taif accord although he staged his war against the army with 
american blessing to enforce implementation of the humiliating 
agreement aoun told the news conference broadcast by his 
station radio lebanon 
artillery generally was silent wednesday allowing civilians to 
emerge from shelters and search for food and missing relatives 
said the police spokesman whose name cannot be used under standing 
regulations 
we received several calls from hospitals asking us to send 
patrols to deal with thousands of nervous and worried people 
inquiring about missing relatives he said 
many of them had pictures of their missing ones others wanted 
to have a look at the bodies or the unconscious wounded the 
hospitals didnt have staff to deal with such cases 
he said surgeons operated by candlelight using water boiled on 
kerosene stoves 
crowds filled the few open bakeries and some people who didnt 
want to wait tried to steal a few loaves he said fistfights 
developed 
on tuesday aoun achieved his most significant victory by 
ousting the lebanese forces from their seven barracks in the hills 
of dbaye on beiruts northern flank 
that put him in postiion to attack the remaining militia 
strongholds in east beirut and in kesrouan byblos and batroun 
provinces north of the capital 
geageas men are experienced street fighters however and aoun 
cannot claim undisputed mastery of the christian enclave until he 
drives them from east beirut and jounieh a port town north of the 
city 
twothirds of the 1 million christians live in east beirut 
where the militia is entrenched in the karantina ashrafiyeh and 
ein rummaneh districts and in jounieh where geagea has total 
control 
hrawi has hinted at requesting help from the syrians who 
support him but their intervention would need advance 
international approval on tuesday hrawi appealed to western 
nations the soviet union the united nations and the arab world 
for help in ending the fighting 
the syrian soldiers were deployed in lebanon in 1976 to quell 
civil war fighting aoun says they violated their peacekeeping 
mandate by siding with the moslems in the civil war

the improbable story of a lawyer with no writing 
experience ending up writing a hit television series is just what 
happened to david e kelley the 33yearold executive producer and 
script writer for la law 
i knew the character names went in the middle of the page 
that was about it i was a complete novice kelley said recently 
of the days in 1983 when he decided to write a script 
he wrote it out in longhand while working for a law firm in 
boston then spent 1200 for a word processor and typed it out 
two fingers at a time 
i remember thinking all i want out of this is to make back the 
money for the word processor 
the rest is show biz his script was optioned to eventually 
become the film from the hip which starred judd nelson in the 
meantime the option was enough to get him an agent and an 
interview with the people looking for someone with legal experience 
to work on what ultimately became nbcs emmy awardwinning series

sindh province innocent people are being killed 
the government clamped a 24hour curfew on two more districts of 
pakistans sprawling southern port city of karachi following a day 
of clashes between police and sharpshooters who fired at random 
from their rooftop perches 
the 41 killings wednesday raised the death toll to 47 since 
monday when clashes began between supporters of the governing 
pakistan peoples party and the mohajir qaumi movement 
representing moslems who emigrated from india after british 
colonial rule ended in 1947 
most of karachis 5 million people belong to the immigrant 
party which is based in the troubled province of sindh 
most of the people were killed by mqm activists said a 
government spokesman who refused to be identified 
the mohajirs blame the killings of two party members on 
supporters of the governing party 
pakistans official news agency said 120 people were being held 
in connection with the daylong shootings no charges have been 
filed yet

dismantle a roadblock by mohajir members a government spokesman 
said snipers opened fire on the police and before the gunbattle 
ended as many as 10 people were dead police said 
angry protesters also attacked police stations demanding the 
arrest of several peoples party members 
prime minister benazir bhutto condemned the killings and blamed 
the mohajirs without naming their party 
in her statement released from islamabad ms bhutto complained 
about a flagrant breach of assurances by a certain political 
group to the government that law and order would be maintained in 
karachi during the strike

while the mohajir qaumi movement represents people who immigrated 
from india after pakistans independence in 1947

president bush visited a strategic 
defense initiative research lab today and declared that a missile 
defense shield in space makes much more sense than ever before 
bush made the pitch for star wars in a speech to what he called 
the underappreciated staff at lawrence livermore national 
laboratories the nerve center of both the star wars research 
effort and nuclear weapons work 
the white house also announced bush has invited west german 
chancellor helmut kohl to camp david on feb 2425 to discuss 
eastwest issues and the prospects for german unification 
later in a speech prepared for delivery to the commonwealth 
club in san francisco bush said he will not predicate the 
defense of our people on promising but as yet unfulfilled hopes 
for the future 
let us not forget that right now the soviets still have more 
than 10000 strategic weapons they are modernizing them said 
bush 
i am determined to seek with the soviets the collateral to 
implement a new peace said bush we have shown that 
american strength is the catalyst for arms control 
we must not let impatience born of euphoria jeopardize all 
we hope to achieve said bush 
bush was beating the drum for his defense budget on a 
crosscountry trip at the same time the soviet communist partys 
central committee was meeting in moscow to renounce its 
sevendecade old monopoly on power in the soviet union 
after the commonwealth club speech bush was flying to omaha 
neb to visit strategic air command headquarters thursday 
bush told the livermore workers the shift toward democracy and 
freedom in the east bloc is a direct result of our ability to 
stand firm in the face of threats to peace and stability 
were working on a significant reduction in arms i think 
thats what the world wants i believe in it strongly bush said 
but to protect the american people we will settle for nothing 
less than the highest confidence in survivability effectiveness 
and safety of our remaining forces 
programs like the strategic defense initiative and one of its 
most promising concepts brilliant pebbles complement our 
ability to preserve the peace into the 1990s and beyond bush 
said 
if the technology ive seen today proves feasible and im 
told it looks very promising no war planner could be confident of 
the consequences of a ballistic missile attack said bush who 
praised the nuclear weapons workers 
i have a funny feeling that because of the nature of the work 
it is somewhat underappreciated by the average man on the street 
in our country said bush 
in the 1990s strategic defense makes much more sense than ever 
before said bush who is asking congress to boost the star wars 
research budget by 1 billion to 48 billion for fiscal 1991 
congress cut 1 billion from its budget this year 
on tuesday night in a los angeles speech where he was heckled 
by aids activists and critics of us aid to el salvador bush took 
a sharp jab at democrats who say his proposed 292 billion pentagon 
budget for fiscal 1991 is too fat in view of the diminished soviet 
threat 
bush appealed to the crowd to back his goslow approach to 
defense retrenchment 
im in a big battle in congress and id like to have your 
support to keep reasonable levels of defense im not going to miss 
an opportunity to cut but i want to do it prudently and i want to 
get something from the other side when we do it he said 
star wars is no longer billed as an impregnable shield capable 
of blocking any enemy launch of a nuclear missile against the 
united states the favored concept now is the socalled brilliant 
pebbles idea conceived by a team of livermore scientists to 
deploy thousands of tiny satellites or miniature rockets in 
lowearth orbit where they could ram and destroy enemy missiles 
bush planned to deliver a foreign policy address before the 
commonwealth club in san francisco before departing for omaha 
neb where he will tour the underground headquarters of the 
strategic air command on thursday 
several hundred demonstrators many bearing signs attacking us 
military support for el salvador jeered chanted and whistled 
outside a los angeles hotel where bush spoke at a 1000aplate 
fundraiser tuesday night for the california republican party 
bush took note of the rapid and welcome change around the 
world as people from panama to prague strive for democracy 
as the nature of the threats to american security change so 
too must our response said bush our forces will remain 
robust welltrained highly professional but geared to the new 
array of challenges of the 90s 
earlier bush watched an armored army brigade wage a mock battle 
in the mojave desert against a training force at fort irwin that 
emulates sovietstyle tactics 
addressing the troops by radio before watching the training 
exercise bush said the events of eastern europe and in the 
soviet union have changed our strategic defense posture it is 
important not to let these encouraging changes political or 
military lull us into a sense of complacency nor can we let down 
our guard against a worldwide threat 
back in washington the chairman of the house armed services 
committee rep les aspin dwis kept up the pressure for defense 
cuts tuesday saying bushs desire to boost spending on big 
strategic weapons programs fails to match the new political 
realities at home or abroad 
this was bushs third trip as president to california a state 
he won narrowly in 1988 he is hoping to bolster the gubernatorial 
campaign of sen pete wilson running to succeed fellow republican 
george deukmejian

president jose eduardo dos santos 
claiming a key battle victory over usbacked rebels has urged 
rebel leader jonas savimbi to accept a ceasefire in the nations 
15yearold civil war 
dos santos speaking at a meeting of angolan farmers tuesday 
night said savimbi would receive humane treatment if he 
accepted the ceasefire part of a government amnesty offer to lead 
to the rebels integration into angolas military economic and 
social structures 
he said that as part of the deal candidates independent of the 
governing popular movement for the liberation of angola would be 
allowed to compete in elections held after the war 
in previous statements dos santos said elections would not end 
oneparty rule by the marxist governing party he also had ruled 
out savimbis national union for the total independence of angola 
or unita from running in any elections 
unita officials contacted in lisbon portugal wednesday refused 
to comment on dos santos speech in the past savimbi has rejected 
government amnesty and integration offers he has insisted that a 
ceasefire be followed by the formation of a transitional 
government to prepare for free multiparty elections 
the president claimed victory in a battle for control of the 
strategic mavinga base in southeast angola 700 miles southeast of 
luanda 
in a statement wednesday government military headquarters said 
the base fell friday and that 543 guerrillas died in the fighting 
it put government casualties at 55 dead 
the rebels however continued wednesday to claim they 
controlled mavinga in a statement from lisbon unita said its 
lines were holding out against intense bombing raids from the 
governments sovietsupplied planes and helicopters 
a western diplomat monitoring the fighting from lisbon said 
government troops had captured mavingas airstrip but that the 
rebels remained in control of their base nearby and were mounting 
counterattacks against government forces 
army sources in luanda said the fall of mavinga would open the 
way for government troops to attack the rebel headquarters at 
jamba 160 miles futher south 
the battle for mavinga is the first major conventional military 
confrontation since south africa agreed to halt support for unita 
and cuba began a withdrawal of its troops backing government 
forces those moves were made in accordance with a 1988 accord 
signed in new york 
dos santos claimed the government advance on mavinga was a 
response to unita violations of a ceasefire agreement sealed in 
june when he met savimbi in zaire 
peace talks mediated by zaires president mobuto sese seko 
followed the zaire agreement but they broke down last summer as 
the ceasefire crumbled amid renewed fighting attempts to bring 
the two sides back to the negotiating table have failed 
president denis sassounguesso of congo is due to discuss angola 
with president bush in washington later this week the united 
states is unitas main backer supplying the rebels with an 
estimated 50 million yearly in military equipment 
unita has been fighting to share control in angola since the 
country gained independence from portugal in 1975

interstate truck drivers generally 
approve of drug testing for themselves and their peers a survey 
shows 
richard beilock a transportation expert for the university of 
floridas institute of food and agricultural sciences said 
wednesday his survey of 1300 drivers in 1989 indicates most 
interstate truckers welcome the federal governments new policy of 
mandatory drug testing part of which went into effect dec 21 
department of transportation regulations reguire among other 
things preemployment drug testing and postaccident testing of 
certain companies engaged in interstate commerce 
the survey showed 66 percent of drivers approve random 
drugtesting while 90 percent support mandatory postaccident 
testing 
it also showed that 84 percent approve of drug tests as an 
employment condition and 76 percent believe a trucker should be 
tested if he gives his employers reason to believe he is a drug 
abuser

good men and women who are concerned about their own safety the 
publics safety and their image said beilock they feel very 
bad that theyre no longer viewed as knights of the road 
the survey was conducted on every trucker who came through

aflcio president lane kirkland spoke 
wednesday of a growing wave of fear among americans over 
escalating health costs and urged congress to enact some form of 
national health care reform 
kirkland joined washington gov booth gardner before the senate 
budget committee where there was agreement about the problems of 
health care costs but few specifics on what to do 
we have a paradox of excess and deprivation said sen jim 
sasser dtenn chairman of the committee we spend more on 
health than any other nation yet many millions of americans 
have no access to health care of any kind 
sasser said 32 million americans have no health insurance and 
that there are 21 countries that have a lower infant mortality rate 
than the united states 
kirkland said rising health care costs have become a major 
obstacle in resolving labor contract disputes 
there is in this country a growing wave of fear well grounded 
fear about health care kirkland said fear of ruin fear of 
physical ruin and fear of economic ruin 
kirkland said the aflcio did not support nationalized health 
care or other specific plans for assuring universal access to care 
we are deliberately keeping all options open kirkland said 
adding that he opposes employers use of pension fund surpluses to 
finance health care benefits except for retirees who are 
beneficiaries of those funds 
gardner who will make health care the top priority of the 
national governors association when he becomes its chairman this 
summer urged congress consult the states 
he said health care costs consume 14 percent of washington state 
revenues and at current rates of growth will take up 23 percent in 
10 years without improving access gardner called for reform that 
would provide universal access to necessary health services 
combined with controls on costs 
ultimately we need to make all residents of this country 
automatically eligible for health coverage gardner said 
meanwhile louis sullivan secretary of the department of health 
and human services told the senate laborhhs appropriations 
subcommittee that there should be more emphasis on primary care and 
disease prevention 
theres no challenging that at its best the american health 
care system has no equal sullivan said 
but while we have emphasized our high technology with 
spectacular results we have developed a system that is very 
expensive and we have also neglected a fundamental bedrock of our 
system and that is providing basic health services to all of our 
citizens 
health care spending in the united states this year is expected 
to exceed 600 billion or more than 12 percent of the nations 
gross national product 
canada spends about a third less per capita on health care than 
the united states while covering all citizens said subcommittee 
chairman sen tom harkin diowa

nebraska might be a great state but some 
of its lawmakers dont think greater nebraska is such a great 
name 
they want people to stop using the terms outstate nebraska 
greater nebraska and lesser nebraska to describe areas of the 
cornhusker state 
and to make the point they adopted a resolution making such 
utterances punishable by a 50 fine even though such a resolution 
cant be enforced 
i did it mostly for the education said cosponsor sen 
sandy scofield who lives in greater nebraska er oops the 
nebraska panhandle 
about one third of the states 157 million residents live in 
the state two largest cities omaha and lincoln the state capital 
the two cities are about 60 miles apart on the eastern edge of the 
state 
the terms outstate nebraska and greater nebraska are often used 
for the vast area outside omahalincoln the 1989 nebraska state 
government directory is riddled with outstate listings and 
even gov kay orr admits to having used the term greater 
nebraska 
the resolution adopted on a 144 vote on monday calls on 
lawmakers constitutional officers state employees and 
representatives of the state to lead the way in eliminating the 
imprecise divisive terms 
the use of the term greater nebraska implies some part of 
the state is lesser nebraska the resolution says 
its a serious matter if you live outside of lincoln or omaha 
it gets more serious the farther west you go said scofield who 
lives in chadron farther from lincoln than any of her 48 
colleagues in the legislature 
another senator from far western nebraska sen dennis baack of 
kimball said he views the whole discussion as a great geography 
lesson 
baack who thinks the state should be referred to by geographic 
areas said the resolution is an effort to make sure people 
understand the geography of their own state better were all 
nebraskans i happen to live in and represent the panhandle 
but you dont have to call us panhandlers

islamic leaders wednesday castigated 
the united states and soviet union for the influx of soviet jews 
into the israelioccupied territories as they gathered to mark the 
20th anniversary of the organization of the islamic conference 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah said washington 
and moscow were guilty of the most dangerous decision against the 
arab world at the turn of the century 
the jewish influx emanates from the soviet union and flows 
under the banner of human rights to settle in the land of their 
choice by dint of the new immigration laws in the united states and 
europe the emir said in a speech read by his minister of islamic 
affairs khaled ahmed aljassar 
alsabah is chairman of the organization of the islamic 
conference the umnbrella grouping for the worlds estimated 1 
billion moslems 
israel has said it expects about 300000 soviet jews to settle 
in the jewish state in the next five years restrictions on 
immigration of soviet jews into the united states have led in part 
to the flood into israel 
the united states and soviet union oppose settling soviet jews 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip saying it is an 
obstacle to making peace with palestinians who are fighting for an 
independent nation 
on jan 15 israels prime minister yitzhak shamir caused 
widespread protests when he said israel must hold onto the occupied 
lands to deal with the wave of expected immigrants 
the makers of the law talk about the right of jews to emigrate 
and settle where they wish and do not talk about the right of the 
arab person to the soil of his homeland and that of his 
forefathers said alsabah 
the anniversary ceremony attracted a number of officials 
including the foreign ministers of egypt senegal and gabon 
the islamic organization was founded after an aug 21 1969

hungary in the soviet bloc mainstream of reforms to establish 
westernstyle democracy will be the second warsaw pact country to 
restore relations with the vatican ties with poland resumed in 
july

social values and shaping moral consciousness it can play an 
important part in the social changes taking place casaroli told 
the hungarian news agency mti before leaving rome on wednesday

catholic majority had been going on for months and both sides had 
earlier agreed pope john paul ii would visit hungary next year

communism was freed from prison by hungarian revolutionaries 
during the 1956 uprising

refuge in the us diplomatic mission in budapest where he stayed 
until hungary agreed to let him leave in 1971 mindszenty died four 
years later in vienna at the age of 83

decades under the former communist leadership enacted a law jan

denominations full autonomy

church assets 
under pressure from the communist government the hungarian 
roman catholic church agreed on aug 30 1950 to surrender its 
autonomy as in other soviet bloc countries a law was subsequently 
established that institutionalized state interference 
the law was annulled tuesday during a meeting between premier 
miklos nemeth and cardinal laszlo paskai the hungarian primate

high school seniors have a disturbing gap 
in their knowledge of geography with only 37 percent able to find 
southeast asia on a world map a study said wednesday 
education secretary lauro cavazos released the first study of 
geography education by the national assessment of educational 
progress which said that the average student could answer just 57 
percent of the questions and that the best score among more than 
3000 students tested was 59 percent 
the results show a disturbing gap in our knowledge of 
geography many of our young people do not know as much about our 
world as they should know said cavazos 
geography education as defined by the assessment includes 
knowledge of the physical characteristics of the planet such as 
its topography and climate as well as the ways that people and 
their environment interact 
more than 3000 high school seniors from 300 public and private 
schools nationwide were asked 76 multiplechoice questions dealing 
with such topics as locations environmental issues climate and 
erosion 
among the survey results 
on a world map 87 percent identified canada 85 percent 
recognized the soviet union 84 percent identified countries in the 
middle east 72 percent identified petroleumexporting countries 
and 71 percent located latin america 
only 37 percent could find southeast asia and 37 percent 
incorrectly said that india is part of the region thirteen percent 
said that either saudi arabia or brazil was in southeast asia 
only 27 percent could use a map to identify a likely area of 
soil erosion but threefourths of the students were aware that the 
united states is a major exporter of grain 
seventynine percent answered questions on the control of acid 
rain 69 percent on pollution from pesticides less than twothirds 
were familiar with the concepts of latitude and longitude 
fifty percent knew that the panama canal cut the sailing time 
between new york and san francisco because ships no longer had to 
sail around the tip of south america 
some of the results are encouraging but most are disturbing 
and confirm what we already know an unacceptably high percentage 
of american high school graduates have not learned geography 
said gilbert grosvenor president of the national geographic 
society which helped finance the study 
the results said gregory anrig president of the educational 
testing service which conducted the survey show that the nations 
youth cannot fully appreciate todays historic events in eastern 
europe or respond to challenges of the global greenhouse effect 
geography is not a priority in most schools the report said 
pointing to a recent survey of the council of chief state school 
officers that found only 18 percent of the states require geography 
for high school graduation 
when it is taught geography is often integrated into other 
courses such as history social studies and science the report 
said 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
said geography instruction at the elementary level should become an 
integral part of the social science curriculum at the highschool 
level he said we should teach about the need to balance 
environmental concerns with those of business and industry 
the national assessment of educational progress popularly known 
as the nations report card is a congressionally mandated project 
of the national center for education statistics in the education 
department it is the only nationally representative and continuing 
assessment of what american students know and can do in various 
subject areas

the senate overwhelmingly approved on 
wednesday legislation providing nearly 15 billion to upgrade 
education and help the united states cope in an increasingly 
competitive world economy 
by a 928 vote senators passed and sent to the house the 
excellence in education act initially submitted to congress by 
president bush last spring 
final passage came after sen jesse helms rnc was thwarted 
in attempts to strike from the bill a provision awarding 25 
million in federal funds over three years to the recently 
established national board for professional teaching standards 
helms and some others argued that the private board with 
federal money would have too great a voice in setting 
teacherqualification standards that ought to be determined at the 
state and local level 
the bill was passed after lawmakers agreed to an amendment by 
sen claiborne pell dri which said no decisions by the board 
could be imposed on private educational institutions or parents who 
teach their children at home 
the board was created in 1987 at the urging of the national 
governors association it is an independent organization governed 
by a 64member board of directors including representatives of 
teachers unions activities so far have been lowkey 
the proposal to authorize 25 million for the board was part of 
a wideranging education bill estimated to cost close to 15 
billion over five years it seeks to combat drugs in public 
schools establish a presidential merit schools program and 
increase aid to schools seeking to reduce dropout rates 
besides helms senators voting against the bill all 
republicans were william armstrong of colorado jake garn of utah 
phil gramm of texas gordon humphrey of new hampshire james 
mcclure and steve symms of idaho and malcolm wallop of wyoming

a terrorist attack on a tour bus that killed 
nine israelis and wounded 20 was plotted abroad and carried out by 
foreigners the interior minister said wednesday 
maj gen abdelhalim moussa who is responsible for internal 
security said his investigators had found clues that i hope will 
lead us to the full dimensions of the incident and those 
responsible 
one of egypts most lucrative tourist markets is drying up 
because of the attack sunday except for journalists israelis are 
staying away from egypt the only arab country that has a peace 
treaty with the jewish state 
two men armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades attacked 
the bus which carried 31 israeli tourists 40 miles northeast of 
cairo the bus one of several carrying travelers from various 
countries that was touring the region sunday was the only one 
filled with israelis 
many israelis have canceled visits to egypt and president hosni 
mubaraks government seems aware of the problem 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid said tuesday in saudi arabia 
he hoped the attack would not deter israelis from coming to egypt 
in the wednesday statement distributed by the official middle 
east news agency moussa said its certain that the 
perpetrators of this crime are nonegyptians and that the plotting 
was done abroad 
he did not elaborate but newspaper reports mention a 
palestinian connection the bus driver who police sources said had 
worked for the bus company less than a month and the man who 
rented the car used by the attackers were said to be palestinians 
sources said most of about 100 suspects detained for questioning 
were palestinians the sources who demanded anonymity said those 
questioned included a palestinian suspected of driving the car the 
attackers were in 
in cairo security was increased at the main synogue and 
seaports airports remained on alert 
about 100000 israelis visited egypt last year but since 
sunday israeli tourists have canceled planned trips up to the 
end of the month said anwar hilal an owner of safaga tours 
which organized sundays bus trip 
a day after the assault the only israelis entering egypt on the 
route the bus had taken were reporters and television crews said 
hilals partner gamal galal 
the number of tourists arriving from the israeli port of eilat 
through taba in southern sinai also has dwindled they said the 
bus came via rafah in northern sinai 
most tourists coming from eilat are nonisraeli but even that 
has been affected hilal said its the general atmosphere 
an israeli tourist who identified himself only as ilan waiting 
to board a sightseeing bus in central cairo said he and a friend 
were the only israelis to travel overland from eilat to egypt the 
day after the attack 
everyone told us not to go but we mustnt connect this 
incident with the attitude of the egyptian people said ilan a 
resident of eilat were staying on for another week 
only five other passengers all from europe were on the bus 
monday from eilat 
the buses from eilat are usually at least halffull mostly 
european british germans swedes said ruth eisenstein tour 
leader of the group 
ms eisenstein a guide with israels galilee tours which works 
with safaga said most people canceled after news of the attack 
spread 
people in eilat especially feel like each one of them has been 
attacked when something like this happens she said 
eilat residents remember october 1985 when an egyptian 
policeman in ras burka sinai went berserk and fired into a group 
of israeli tourists four children and three adults were killed 
i tell them they must come and try egypt but they wont

austria which for years insisted it was 
itself a victim of nazi germany has agreed to pay about 25 
million in reparations to jewish survivors of the holocaust 
officials said wednesday 
under a plan worked out by the government and the new yorkbased 
jewish claims conference on austria the 25 million will be 
invested in projects aimed at helping jewish survivors of death 
camps or those forced to flee the nazi terror in austria the 
officials said 
some government officials said austrias new willingness to pay 
reparations implicitly weakened its traditional argument that it 
was itself a victim of nazi aggression 
some austrian jews indicated the change of heart was a result of 
the uproar over the 1986 election to the presidency of kurt 
waldheim when the nation was forced to confront its past 
waldheim secretarygeneral of the united nations from 1972 to 
1982 has denied that he was involved in war crimes when he served 
as a junior officer in the german army in yugoslavia in world war 
ii 
much of the 25 million will be invested in homes for the 
elderly in the united states israel and elsewhere catering to 
large numbers of expatriate austrian jews although some of the 
amount will likely be spent in austria said finance ministry 
spokesman dietmar ecker 
he said the money is to be distributed over the next five years 
about 4 million this year 5 million in the three subsequent 
years and 6 million in 1994 
austria already pays small pensions to individuals both at home 
and abroad deemed to be victims of the nazis and it agreed in 1988 
to provide them an additional onetime payment of several hundred 
dollars but this is the first time a large sum will be paid 
exclusively to austrian jews 
ecker would not directly comment on whether the move meant 
austria was distancing itself from its historic contention that the 
country was the first victim of nazi germany saying only this 
act should be seen as a signal 
but other officials speaking on condition of anonymity agreed 
that the move weakens the traditional argument 
prominent austrian jews pointed out that although the allies 
themselves considered austria the first target of nazi germany 
which absorbed its southern neighbor in 1938 the high level of 
austrian support for the annexation was ignored for decades 
also ignored was the fact that membership in the austrian nazi 
party at the end of the war was higher on a percentual basis than 
in germany 
many notorious nazi figures such as adolf eichmann were 
austrian as was adolf hitler himself 
earlier governments took the point of view that austria itself 
was a victim and they had no reason to offer reparations nazi 
hunter simon wiesenthal said in a telephone interview 
the waldheim thing left its mark it forced the austrians to 
deal with their own pasts said wiesenthal a prominent austrian 
jew who lost family members during the holocaust 
weisenthal praised chancellor franz vranitzky who took office 
in 1986 for repeatedly attempting to dispell the myth that 
austrians were only victims and not aggressors as well 
paul grosz leader of viennas jewish community said austrias 
willingess to compensate holocaust victims is not merely a belated 
attempt to deal with bad publicity over the waldheim affair 
this is not reparation for waldheim its reparation for nazi 
crimes he said 
east germany which until now has refused to consider 
reparations is now also reconsidering the new leadership held 
talks with israeli officials earlier this month on the possibility 
of such payments as a way of establishing diplomatic relations 
the austrian sum pales in comparison to the more than 40 
billion dispensed by west germany to jews and israel under a 1952 
agreement 
but grosz said the austrian payment while it could not begin to 
compensate for the genocide wrought on austrian jews seemed 
equitable considering that those who are alive to benefit now 
number only about 40000 
some 68000 austrian jews died in nazi concentration camps 
during world war ii and more that 120000 others were incarcerated 
in camps or fled the country in all the nazis exterminated about 
6 million jews

two us drug enforcement agency planes 
flying reconaissance reportedly to provide security for an 
antidrug summit are creating nationalistic furor one week before 
president bush is scheduled to arrive 
i ask myself why the gringos dont also let us send a 
colombian air squadron to detect the cocaine distributors that 
provide the substance to 30 million drug consumers in the united 
states said alberto santofimio a presidential candidate and 
liberal party senator 
this would be the only way for colombians to know how many 
more mayors in addition to washingtons are possessed by the drug 
devil said santofimio in tuesday speech that was published 
wednesday in the newspaper la prensa 
he was referring to the us capitals mayor marion barry 
arrested last month on a cocaine possession charge 
the colombian civil air authority authorized flights this month 
of two aerocommander aircraft belonging to the dea us planes 
have been allowed to fly over the country for years to obtain 
information about cocaine labs and other drug operations 
colombias attorney general alfonso gomez said earlier this 
week that he ordered an investigation to determine if civil 
aviation officials exceeded their authority by granting the planes 
permission to fly over the country 
but the announcement has done little to soften the rhetoric of 
santofimio and other politicians angered by persistent press 
commentaries that the us planes were violating the countrys 
sovereignty 
santofimio is one of several colombian congressmen whose us 
visas were canceled last year us authorities gave no reason for 
their decision but unconfirmed reports held that the colombian 
officials had been linked to drug traffickers 
us ambassador thomas mcnamara said any us aircraft flying 
over colombia are doing so with permission of the countrys 
government 
the people who are violating airspace are the drug traffickers 
flying cocaine into the united states mcnamara told reporters at 
a tuesday briefing for the colombian press a transcript was 
obtained wednesday 
colombian traffickers are responsible for processing and 
smuggling 80 percent of the cocaine sold on us streets according 
to us officials 
the colombian news media have reported that the dea planes are 
using sophisticated observation equipment to detect missiles or 
other weapons that might be used by drug traffickers to try to kill 
bush during his visit us officials in bogota have refused to 
comment on dea operations 
last month reports surfaced in washington that the medellin 
cocaine cartel had obtained surfacetoair missiles to try to shoot 
down bushs plane when it arrives on feb 15 for the antidrug 
summit the medellin cartel in phone calls to local media denied 
having any missiles 
the controversy over the aircraft comes less than a month after 
the bush administration recalled a us fleet planning drug 
interdiction operations off colombias caribbean coast 
bush apparently did not consult with colombian president 
virgilio barco until reports of the fleets movement toward the 
caribbean surfaced in the news media 
bush is to meet with barco and the presidents of peru and 
bolivia at the antidrug summit in the port of cartagena intended 
to ratify a plan for greater cooperation 
peru and bolivia are the biggest producers of the coca leaf used 
by colombian traffickers to process the drug the united states is 
the worlds largest consumer of cocaine

powerless partner of the communists announced wednesday that it 
will join the opposition

arrangement saying it would have little influence

said he expects twothirds of the delegates will vote at a special 
congress to leave the communist party and create a social 
democratic party

party members support the alliance 
bulgarias first free elections since world war ii are planned 
for may and the communist party has been meeting with opposition 
groups to carry out some reforms in preparation for the balloting 
at talks held wednesday the union of democratic forces an 
umbrella group representing opposition groups proposed that 
parliament be presented with a constitutional amendment that would 
bar communist party organizations at work places 
the state news agency bta said the opposition charged that the 
communist partys wish to preserve its structures until elections 
gives it advantages despite renunciation of constitutional 
guarantees about its leading role 
the opposition plan also would ban any other political party 
from forming organizations at work places bta reported 
the communists said the issue of the partys role in the economy 
would be regulated in a law on political parties now being drafted 
and likely to be submitted to parliament in march bta reported it 
gave no further details 
compared with their east bloc neighbors bulgarian communists 
have given up relatively little power 
talks between the party and the opposition are to resume feb

a legislator said she hopes the state

for sterilization of childsupport scofflaws and requiring 
counseling and spousal consent for vasectomies 
sen charlotte pritt a prochoice advocate said she thinks her 
bills are as worthless as those requiring that women undergo 
counseling and receive consent from their mates before having 
abortions 
pritt said she introduced the bills at the request of a 
constituent who was interested in encouraging lawmakers to think 
about repercussions of abortioncurbing legislation 
i hope that none of this legislation is passed she said 
it is all repressive if someone feels strongly about something 
its a legislators courtesy to offer legislation to be introduced 
the person may not agree with it but will introduce it for the 
sake of dialogue 
the bill was referred to the senate health and human resources 
committee where committee chairman bob holliday said he intends to 
let it die without having a vote on it 
these are companion pieces to antichoice legislation that 
affects women pritt said i was asked to put in legislation 
that would be comparable but make men responsible for their 
actions 
pritts legislation calls for a court to issue a contempt 
citation before ordering a person to be involuntarily sterilized 
for falling a year behind in support payments 
pritt also introduced a bill that calls for a physician to 
counsel the spouse regarding the performance of a vasectomy in 
cases in which he is counseling the wife about the performance of a 
tubal ligation 
her third bill would require a spouses written consent before a 
man could obtain a vasectomy 
notice is not required if the performance of the vasectomy is 
necessary to save the mans life the bill said 
several of the antiabortion measures targeted by pritts 
package have been introduced by state sen mark manchin 
my reaction is that i hope we wouldnt get caught up 
introducing frivolous companion legislation in order to make the 
other side look somehow unimportant manchin said if these are 
sincere bills with sincere intentions fine but if they are 
introduced solely to make other bills dealing with the same subject 
matter look frivolous or unimportant i think the approach shes 
taking is wrong

a french aid agency reported wednesday that two 
european doctors kidnapped over the weekend in southern sudan are 
being held by the rebel sudanese peoples liberation army 
martin ruppert a 28yearold from the netherlands and 
christine van haegenoth a 26yearold belgian are in good 
health said a statement from the parisbased medecins sans 
frontieres 
it was the first identification of the assailants who took the 
two physicians friday night from their home in malakal a garrison 
city on the nile 370 miles south of the capital khartoum 
medecins sans frontieres or doctors without borders said talks 
are under way with the rebels to free the two doctors who work for 
the nongovernmental organizations belgian branch 
a spokeswoman for the group in brussels inneke van velzen said 
monday that the doctors may have been kidnapped by the rebels to 
treat their casualties from the civil war 
the rebels led by john garang a renegade colonel have been 
fighting the moslemdominated government since 1983 for increased 
economic and political autonomy for the predominantly christian and 
animist southern half of the country 
ruppert and haegenoth were working on a longterm medical 
nutritional program to help the people of malakal and the 
surrounding desert 
the french section of medecins sans frontieres recently withdrew 
its workers from sudan after unidentified attackers shot down a 
plane carrying two of its doctors a french pilot and a sudanese 
working for the united nations 
the belgian section has pulled out three workers since the 
abduction van velzen said

the world bank will vote thursday on a 30 
million earthquake relief loan to china its first loan since the 
communist government suppressed a democracy movement in june 
bank president barber b conable will present the loan to a 
closeddoor meeting of representatives of the 151 governments that 
own the bank said spokesman peter riddleberger 
a series of earthquakes hit northern china in october killing 
at least 29 people and destroying 5000 to 8000 houses 
the world bank is the biggest source of aid to third world 
countries lending more than 21 billion a year riddleberger said 
no other loan to china would come up at this session 
soon after government tanks rolled into beijings tiananmen 
square conable decided to hold back 780 million in loans to china 
that had been due for approval later president bush said he was 
asking the bank not to make the loans 
conable has said the bank considers only economic conditions 
when it grants loans in june he withdrew the banks permanent 
representatives in beijing but they returned within a few weeks 
he said then that he hoped to resume lending to china soon 
the united states is the biggest shareholder in the bank but 
does not have a veto power over loans china and india have been 
the biggest borrowers 
the loan that goes before the board thursday would be repayable 
in 40 years with only nominal interest the united states is 
expected to be represented by its board member e patrick coady 
a spokesman at the us treasury which is responsible for 
relations with the bank declined to say how coady would vote 
the us governments own exportimport bank last week made an 
unannounced loan of 975 million to the china national offshore 
oil corp and was expected to announce another larger loan friday

the nations governors pressed congress and 
president bush on wednesday to speed the pollution cleanup of 
military bases weapons plants and other federal lands saying us 
environmental laws are routinely ignored in cases where the 
states are hamstrung from enforcement 
if you make a mess you clean it up were saying that goes for 
the federal government as well as private citizens idaho gov 
cecil andrus told a capitol news conference in behalf of the 
national governors association 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine acknowledged 
there is a compelling need to give states clearer authority to 
assess fees and penalties against federal government facilities 
where pollution laws are violated 
in congress we establish national environmental policy surely 
one of the goals of that policy is to assure that facilities owned 
by the federal government avoid contamination of our environment 
said mitchell 
andrus cochairman of the task force that developed the 
governors report said that while bush has recognized the 
problem he has proposed too little money for the federal cleanup 
effort and has allowed the environmental protection agency to 
remain hamstrung from taking enforcement actions against 
federal polluters 
the governors report said the extent of pollution on federal 
property ranging from military bases to weapons plants run by the 
energy department to vast lands controlled by the interior 
department is so broad that its full scope remains undefined 
various government estimates on the cost of cleaning up the 
nuclear weapons plants alone have ranged upwards of 100 billion 
the governors called for an expanded program that would finish 
the task over the next 30 years 
meantime the governors said the environmental protection 
agency should be set free to pursue federal as well as private 
polluters through civil lawsuits and enforcement actions 
the agencys enforcement powers have been crippled by the 
justice department which has prohibited the epa from filing 
lawsuits or taking unilateral enforcement actions against other 
federal agencies said the report 
the nations chief environmental watchdog is forced to sit by 
as basic environmental statutes and regulations are routinely 
ignored at federally owned facilities the report continued 
furthermore the governors complained state authorities often 
have been thwarted in monitoring and taking action against 
violators of environmental laws on federal property by claims of 
national security and sovereign immunity 
andrus who was interior secretary under president carter 
suggested that bush could resolve the problems between the epa and 
justice department with one phone call 
andrus said that the proposed 45 billion allocated for various 
environmental cleanup efforts on federal facilities under bushs 
fiscal 1991 budget is inadequate to do the job he said less 
than half is devoted to actual cleanup activities 
the environmental protection agency lists 1268 federal 
facilities earmarked for priority cleanup efforts and that number 
is expected to expand 
for many years federal facilities have been among the worst 
violators of federal pollution laws with neither the epa nor 
state agencies able to hold facility managers accountable the 
governors complained 
the report added that in addition to the highly publicized 
violations of environmental laws at atomic weapons plants fuels 
oil solvents paints acids heavy metals and other hazardous 
chemicals have been routinely stored and improperly disposed of 
by federal officials over the years

the names of 26 million parents who owe child 
support have been given to the internal revenue service so that any 
federal income tax refunds they are due can be used to pay their 
obligations officials said 
last year nearly 452 million was collected by garnishing 
federal income tax refunds under the program 
parents subject to garnishing are those who owe 500 or more in 
child support or who owe at least 150 in child support and have 
children receiving aid to families with dependent children 
assistance 
the program is considered a costeffective way to make sure 
children are getting the support they are due said eunice thomas 
acting director of the office of child support enforcement in the 
department of health and human services 
under the program it costs an average of 454 per case to 
collect an average of 654 for nonafdc cases and an average of 
562 for afdc cases she said 
the program enacted by congress was begun in 1981 for afdc 
families and expanded in 1984 to other families

turkey said greek christians attacked a 
turkish state television crew wednesday in an ethnically restive 
area of northwestern greece the greek government denied it 
a foreign ministry statement said greeks attacked the crew in 
komotini near the turkish border where it was covering a bail 
hearing for ahmet sadik and ibrahim sherif prominent members of 
the moslem ethnic turkish community 
sadik and sherif were sentenced jan 25 to 18 months in prison 
each for describing their minority as turkish moslem in 
election campaign fliers last year 
greece recognizes only the religious identity of its 120000 
ethnic turks and banned reference to their ethnicity in 1987 
on wednesday a komotini court refused to release the two ethnic 
turks on bail while their appeal is pending 
the foreign ministry claimed a west german television team and a 
west german lawyer representing sadik and sherif also were handled 
roughly 
it is cause for anxiety that these ugly attacks took place in 
front of the greek prosecutor and policemen it said greek 
authorities have thus shown that they completely disregard 
international rules and principles applying to news media 
freedoms 
greeces public order ministry said police protected the turkish 
television crew throughout the three days in komotini despite the 
fact that neither events nor conditions prevailing these days 
warranted any fears 
under these circumstances the claims of the turkish foreign 
ministry can only provoke regret at the distortion of the truth 
the ministry said 
three days after sadik and sherif were sentenced christians in 
komotini attacked moslems who protested protested the verdict 
seventeen christians and four moslems were slightly injured and 
windows were broken in scores of shops belonging to moslems 
greece ordered the turkish consul in komotini out of the 
country accusing him of making inflammatory statements and turkey 
expelled the greek consul in istanbul in retaliation

white house science adviser d allan bromley 
said wednesday that construction work on the superconducting super 
collider should be delayed until industry proves it can manufacture 
the specialized magnets required by the massive atom smasher 
bromley director of the office of science and technology policy 
in the white house told members of the house committee on science 
space and technology that part of the 318 million requested for 
the supercollider in fiscal 1991 will be spent proving that such 
magnets can be built 
it is prudence not to move forward until such time that we 
have demonstrated that we can make the magnets industrially 
bromley said during sharp questioning from members of the house 
committee 
he said 300 million is to be used in 1991 for site preparation 
at the supercollider site near waxahachie texas about 30 miles 
south of dallas the science adviser said that work will be delayed 
until it is proven that the magnets can be built 
bromley said the supercollider will require 10000 magnets made 
of superconducting material so far he said it has not been 
proven that industry is capable of making such magnets in such 
large numbers 
were pushing technology to the absolute limit he said 
it will require tons of superconducting material 
bromley said a demonstration of magnet manufacturing is expected 
to be completed within a year and said no major site preparation 
for the project can begin until then 
the superconducting super collider is an underground 53mile 
circular raceway that scientists will use to smash subatomic 
particles together at very high velocities the particles will be 
compressed and accelerated by the powerful magnets placed along the 
circular tunnel 
by smashing the subatomic particles scientists hope to answer 
fundamental questions about the nature and origin of matter a 
basic goal in physics 
bromley was sharply questioned by several congressmen who 
expressed concern about the rising price tag of the super collider 
the device to be the worlds largest research tool was first 
said to cost about 5 billion but the projected cost has crept 
upward 
rep sherwood l boehlert rny said the department of 
energy which is in charge of the project has estimated the price 
of the collider now at more than 7 billion and the final cost may 
be even higher 
is there a point at which the ssc becomes simply too expensive 
to build boehlert asked 
the simple answer to that is yes said bromley but he did 
not put an upper limit on the cost 
in a reference to an expensive toilet facility once built for an 
air force airplane boehlert said the rising cost of the super 
collider makes a 600 toilet seat look like a bargain 
let me approach this from the other end bromley injected 
when the packed hearing room echoed with laughter the science 
adviser ducked his head and noted that was a singularly 
unfortunate expression 
well well just flush that out said boehlert triggering 
another burst of laughter 
browley said that the price of the super collider has gone up 
because experts have examined the original design and found 
shortcomings 
the magnets are not perfect he said you run into trouble 
if the particles run too slowly the consensus of the experts is 
that you must increase the speed of the particles as they enter the 
ring 
to accomplish this he said the design of the magnets and the 
aperture where the particles are injected must be changed this 
raises the cost bromley said

sen robert byrd dwva on wednesday 
endorsed the idea of restributing foreign aid praising a 
republican proposal to trim aid from some bigticket countries and 
give it to others 
everything is on the table said byrd chairman of the 
senate appropriations committee 
byrd also said the peace dividend money from cuts in 
defense will not increase the foreign aid pie 
our foreign aid budget has taken on a new and suddenly 
enhanced importance as an instrument of our goals and policies in 
the world said byrd remarking on the need to influence changing 
event in eastern europe 
it no longer can be viewed as a kind of wellheeled junior 
varsity lobbyist sport he said of foreign aid 
in a statement on the senate floor byrd praised senate minority 
leader robert dole rkan for proposing to reallocate foreign 
aid by cutting back on the amount of money traditionally given to 
five allies israel egypt turkey the philippines and pakistan 
they take up about 80 percent of the us aid budget 
mr dole has done this body a service and raised the issues 
publicly taken criticism from all sides sat out on the edge so 
to speak with his legs dangling over the side byrd said 
dole first suggested in an article in the new york times that 
five countries absorb aid reductions of 5 percent with the 
remainder redirected to eastern europe 
doles proposal particularly his suggestion that aid to israel 
be reduced drew immediate fire from a number of repubublican and 
democratic senators israel the largest us aid recipient 
receives about 3 billion a year 
but sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee that divides up foreign aid welcomed 
the debate 
while not naming individual countries byrd said some of our 
historic aid recipients can probably take cuts substantially larger 
than 5 percent somewhere between 10 percent and 20 percent would 
be more realistic he said 
but byrd disagreed with dole on the practice of congressional 
earmarking setting aside certain amounts for various 
countries dole argued the practice limits the presidents 
flexibility byrd said the practice is a congressional perogative 
the bush administration has proposed an aid package of about 
148 billion for fiscal 1991 slightly more than the previous year

house republican leaders wednesday unveiled a 
legislative agenda described as giving americans the right to 
make the choice about their lives it makes no mention of the 
most controversial choice issue abortion 
the national republican party has taken a strong antiabortion 
stand and conservative gop house members said that wasnt affected 
by the legislativegoals list 
house minority leader robert michel of illinois leadoff speaker 
among gop lawmakers describing the list to reporters said it had 
no overriding theme he called it pretty much boilerplate 
republican dogma 
but rep mickey edwards a key architect of the document said 
if there is a theme and we didnt approach it from that area 
its a theme of empowerment a theme of giving people the right to 
make the choice that is going to affect their life 
rep duncan hunter said the legislativeagenda document referred 
to choice in education using choice in the sense of exercising 
freedom rather than choice in abortion where you limit the freedom 
to live of one party i think you see that common thread throughout 
the document 
i think it very strongly reinforces the traditional republican 
concept that freedom is important and that empowering people to 
make their own lives better by giving them freedoms rather than 
restricting them by imposing governmental programs on them the 
california republican said 
rep vin weber of minnesota said that for purposes of dealing 
with the abortion the house republican leaders draw a distinction 
between themselves and the gop hierarchy choosing to let the 
republican national committee confront the issue 
there was never a house republican agenda that came forward 
that included the right to life he said its been part of our 
national party platform 
we basically leave it at that level within the party weber 
said and to the vast majority of righttolife leaders thats 
an appropriate position for our party to take 
said house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia my judgment is 
the republican party will be the party which wants to have the 
fewest possible number of abortions the democratic party will be 
the party which has a very large wing which is capriciously 
unconcerned about when abortions occur 
but gingrich also said that the republicans have to accept 
that some of our colleagues are going to disagree on an issue which 
is profoundly emotional and profoundly important and were just 
going to have to live within that framework 
republican national chairman lee atwater told gop leaders last 
month the party welcomes prochoice candidates despite its 
antiabortion stance and he described internal debate over 
abortion as part of the growing pains of becoming a majority 
party

modrow said german unification was discussed at the talks but 
that they centered on changing and improving economic ties between 
the two states closely linked when they were ruled by hardline 
communist governments 
last fall peaceful revolutions toppled the hardline 
governments in east berlin and prague 
modrow said he and calfa agreed that all processes on our 
continent including that of unification of both german states 
should only be completed in a process which respects and preserves 
the interests of neighbors and european states 
the east german premier last thursday introduced a plan for 
unifying germany envisaging it as a neutral state eventually 
governed from berlin 
modrow made no other reference to reunification and the subject 
was not mentioned in a similarly brief statement from calfa 
calfa said the two sides established working groups to discuss 
investment prices and tourism 
under new leadership headed by president vaclav havel 
czechoslovakia has sought to improve ties with east germany and 
west germany

his decision to attend next weeks drug summit in colombia and 
insisted he wont do anything stupid or macho 
it isnt whimsical or a desire to be in harms way said 
bush he said he was sure the summit will be secure at the site at 
a wellfortified installation cut off from the colombian mainland 
except for one entrance 
im not going to do something stupid or macho bush told the 
commonwealth club 
he added laughing that he loves the switch in his image 
this guy they used to call timid is now macho man he said 
bush will fly to colombia and spend several hours at the summit 
in cartagena on feb 15 with colombian president virgilio barco and 
officials of bolivia and peru 
he said it was important that he do nothing that might even 
inadvertantly signal to barco that he should cut a deal with 
his countrys drug cartels 
i think weve got good arrangements and i think it is good 
sound antinarcotics policy to support president barco who is 
doing an awful lot to protect our kids from the scourge of 
narcotics he said 
bush also drew applause from the crowd of more than 2500 when 
he said weve condoned things in this country that we should 
have condemned long ago in terms of narcotics 
among those joining in the applause was former secretary of 
state george p shultz seated at bushs right shultz created a

in one of her first actions as head of the 
health care financing administration gail wilensky is proposing to 
centralize the federal operations of medicaid in their own office 
sources said tuesday 
wilenskys plan is designed to help make medicaid more 
responsive to the states which share the cost of the program 
providing health care for the poor the federal share of the 
program is about 40 billion a year 
creating a medicaid bureau within the health care financing 
administration would change the environment within hcfa to permit 
medicaid to get its share of attention said a source close to 
wilensky who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the point of doing this is to make hcfa more responsive to the 
states and to encourage them to find more innovative ways of 
dealing with health care access 
medicaid operations currently are handled in several different 
offices in wilenskys domain under her these would be centralized 
into a single bureau that would report to her no staff would be 
cut 
wilensky who took office on monday has presented her plan to 
her boss louis sullivan secretary of health and human services 
the federal medicaid bureaucracy coordinates the operations of 
56 different medicaid programs run by the states the district of 
columbia and us territories

president bush said wednesday that star 
wars makes more sense than ever in light of recent changes in 
the soviet union and estern europe 
bushs comments came after he toured the nations biggest 
nuclear weapons research lab then told a group of business leaders 
he wanted to refrain from reacting to the soviet central 
committees apparent endorsement of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs political reforms 
theres an awful lot to be hopeful for there bush said 
but he added the last thing he wanted to do when you 
have the central committee meeting is to try to finetune it from 
san francsico or washington as to how they ought to conduct 
themselves 
at a questionandanswer session at san franciscos commonwealth 
club bush was asked how the united states could help gorbachev 
achieve his reforms 
i think we can avoid doing dumb things bush said 
he told the businesscommunity audience that the united states 
should continue to modernize its strategic weapons programs and the 
strategic defense initiative 
this purely defensive concept doesnt threaten a single person 
anywhere in the world god forbid if it ever had to be used it 
would be used against missiles not against people bush said 
after touring the nearby lawrence livermore national laboratory 
where the bulk of star wars research occurs 
in the 1990s strategic defense makes much more sense than 
ever before said bush who has proposed spending 45 billion on 
the spacebased antimissile system in the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 
i would rather be called cautious than reckless bush said 
about his defense policy 
the president is on a threeday trip to focus attention on his 
proposed 292 billion pentagon budget for fiscal 1991 which 
democrats say gives too much to strategic weapons systems while 
closing bases 
he tempered his proposal for wholesale closing of us military 
bases with a vow for federal aid to help the communities and 
individuals affected 
civilians laid off will get top priority for other defense 
department jobs and the administration will help communities that 
lose bases develop powerful new economic assets new ways to use 
old bases 
speaking in a heavily democratic area where five military 
installations would be closed bush said there have been no 
politics in these proposals 
he was applauded when he said longstanding critics of 
defense spending should not turn around and block the closing of a 
base in their home districts 
in a wideranging halfhour question and answer session after 
his speech bush 
called proposals for a reunified germany that would be a member 
of nato encouraging the white house also announced that bush 
had invited nato general secretary manfred woerner to camp david 
this weekend to discuss the reunification issue west german 
chancellor helmut kohl will meet separately with bush later this 
mounth 
said he didnt think going to colombia on feb 15 for a drug 
summit would be dangerous im not going to do something stupid 
or macho 
said the soviet union could help do more to bring about peace 
in the middle east including normalizing diplomatic relations with 
israel 
several hundred protesters waged a noisy demonstration outside 
the san francisco hotel where bush spoke many carrying signs 
protesting us policy in latin america and aids policy 
the secret service sent a decoy presidential limousine and 
modified motorcade down ellis street to confuse the demonstrators 
then hastily drove the president off in the opposite direction for 
the airport 
bush also was met by demonstrators as he toured the lawrence 
livermore lab and at a gop fundraising dinner tuesday night 
the president said he welcomed recent prodemocracy developments 
in eastern europe and the soviet union but that we must not let 
impatience born out of euphoria jeopardize all we hope to 
achieve 
we must remain in europe as long as we are needed and wanted 
let us not forget that the soviets still have more than 
10000 nuclear strategic weapons they are modernizing them they 
have deployed two new mobile icbms and their spending on strategic 
defense is comparable to their spending on strategic offensive 
forces 
bush was briefed on latest star wars technology during his tour 
of the lawrence livermore national laboratory which is part of the 
university of california but is under an extensive longterm 
government contract to do nuclearweapons research 
if the technology ive seen today proves feasible and im 
told it looks very promising no war planner could be confident of 
the consequences of a ballistic missile attack the technologies 
you are now researching developing and testing will strengthen 
deterrence bush said 
sdi has been controversial since president reagan proposed it in 
1983 as an impregnable shield capable of blocking incoming nuclear 
missiles 
congress cut 1 billion this year from bushs request for a 48 
billion star wars budget bush last week asked for a 1 billion 
increase for fiscal 1991 
the president called the latest star wars concept dubbed 
brillant pebbles the most promising of all sdi programs 
thousands of the interceptors would be orbited in clusters on 
space stations firing automatically at any intruding missiles and 
ramming them like shot gun pellets 
bushs next stop on his threeday tour of defense installations 
and republican fundraising events was to be omaha neb where he 
will tour the underground headquarters of the strategic air command

a committee led by chancellor helmut kohl on 
wednesday began laying the groundwork for german unification after 
the cabinet agreed to seek immediate talks with east germany on 
joining the two countries currencies 
chief government spokesman hans klein said kohl would travel to 
camp david on feb 24 to discuss german unity with president bush 
government sources also said kohl and foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher will travel to moscow on saturday for talks 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
kohl advisor horst teltschik speaking on west german television 
said the chancellors message to gorbachev will be to make clear 
that the german selfdetermination is advancing because the 
people in east germany are deciding the process and the speed of 
selfdetermination and no one else 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze suggested last 
week that that the issue be put to an international referendum 
rudolf seiters kohls chief of staff said the german unity 
committee began its work immediately after its formation wednesday 
the panel will examine all the steps necessary for unification 
including creation of a monetary union to make the west german mark 
east germanys currency unlike west german marks east german 
marks are not convertible 
the west german central bank would be responsible for monetary 
policy of both states under the monetary union 
according to seiters west germany plans to discuss 
confederative cooperation with east germany immediately after 
east germanys first free elections which are set for march 18 
seiters said immediate talks on monetary union are necessary 
because of the dramatic speed of developments in east germany and 
the continuing exodus of east germans to west germany kohl on 
tuesday proposed urgent talks on uniting the nations currencies 
with an average of 1800 east germans leaving the country daily 
66000 have arrived in west germany since the start of the year 
adding to more than 340000 who resettled across the border in 1989 
the departure of skilled workers along with strikes and 
absenteeism are driving east germanys economy to the brink of 
collapse and the influx into west germany is straining the 
countrys social services 
klein told reporters in bonn the government would start talks 
with the new east german government immediately after the march 18 
elections on confederate cooperation between the two states in 
germany with a view to their growing together further 
decisions will be required even before then klein added 
the question of german unity has become a dominant theme all 
political forces in east germany are now committed to this 
objective 
klein said the special committee set up to study unification 
questions includes cabinet ministers responsible for the following 
areas foreign affairs interior justice finance economics 
education and labor 
he said the committee would work on formation of a monetary 
union financial questions economic reforms energy and 
environment infrustructure in east germany employment and social 
welfare systems legal questions and foreign and security policy 
matters 
economics minister helmut haussmann said that after east 
germanys elections the two nations would begin immediate 
discussions on the economic reforms necessary in east germany 
haussmann said a germangerman economic miracle like the one 
that made west germany wealthy is possible as the two countries 
draw closer together 
west german officials have acknowledged it will cost billions of 
dollars to rescue east germanys economy and compensate for losses 
of jobs as the country adjusts to a freemarket economy one of the 
results of the fall prodemocracy movement 
the peaceful revolution ended the communists monopoly on power 
led to the opening of the countrys borders in november and led to 
the scheduling of the countrys first free elections in march 
three leftist opposition movements agreed to join forces and 
campaign as a coalition in the elections east germanys official 
adn news agency said wednesday 
the three are new forum democracy now and the initiative for 
peace and human rights said adn new forum is east germanys

the tourism minister resigned 
wednesday after accusing the national salvation front of using 
dictatorial methods he was the fourth member of the 
provisional government to quit 
the minister mihai lupoi is an army officer who played an 
important role in the revolution that overthrew dictator nicolae 
ceausescu on dec 22 by making the first public appeal by an 
officer for soldiers to join the revolt 
dan radulescu chief of the fronts press and public relations 
said lupoi had proved incompetent and had no chance of 
maintaining his post after elections scheduled for may 20 
lupoi was a mistake of the revolution radulescu said 
such mistakes are inevitable when things happen as quickly as 
they did here and we are now correcting them 
lupoi a 36yearold army architect promoted to major after the 
revolution said in an interview he also was resigning from the 
military he said he had encountered hostility in the past month 
from defense minister nicolae militaru an army general who came 
out of retirement 
his resignation follows those of silviu brucan the fronts 
foreign policy expert front spokesman aurel dragos munteanu and 
its interim vice president dumitru mazilu 
brucan said in an interview the lupoi resignation had no 
connection with his and was not necessarily politically 
significant some of lupois allegations against the government 
sounded like fantasy brucan said 
the national salvation front took over after the fall of 
ceausescu who was executed dec 25 and rules by decree pressure 
has grown for it to become more democratic and it agreed recently 
to share some power with other political parties in a national 
unity council that would govern until the elections 
lupoi said his resignation resulted from differences with 
prime minister petre roman on personal and professional matters 
his original letter of resignation given to roman on tuesday 
afternoon contained a sharp denunciation of the leaderships 
methods 
he said his attempt to reorganize the tourism ministry was 
impeded by excessive government bureaucracy dictatorial 
methods in the relationship between the government and the 
ministry and an improper and illdefined division of 
responsibility between the government and the front 
at a meeting tuesday evening lupoi said other ministers 
accused him of trying to take the people into the streets 
against the front and tried to fire him instead of letting him 
resign 
eventually he agreed to submit a more moderate version of his 
letter and the resignation was accepted wednesday morning lupoi 
said 
the minister said the front had to accept multiparty 
democracy because of popular demand but they dont like it 
on wednesday afternoon 200 people gathered outside the 
television headquarters in bucharest to protest the fronts control 
of radio and television 
they carried signs saying we want independent television and 
down with munteanu down with communism munteanu kept his job 
as broadcasting chief after resigning as front spokesman 
a report of the protest the second this week for greater access 
to television was broadcast on the nightly tv news opinion in 
the street is divided on whether tv is truly independent the 
report said 
merchant marine cadets ended a 31hour hunger strike in victory 
square after getting assurances wednesday night that the government 
would remove their academy from military control 
in a demonstration at the education ministry vocational 
students demanded the replacement of many technical high schools 
with schools oriented toward the sciences and humanities

members of congress approved a resolution 
wednesday saying that editing changes in the congressional record 
seriously threaten the integrity of the house 
the resolution approved 37330 came after remarks by rep gus 
savage dill were deleted from the official record of house and 
senate proceedings and debate 
savage took the floor last week to announce that the ethics 
committee had ended its investigation of him and to call the 
allegations against him a racist attack by the news media and 
government officials 
savage who is black attacked the motivations of the three 
white democrats who had complained to the ethics panel reps 
patricia schroeder of colorado matthew mchugh of new york and 
barney frank of massachusetts 
the ethics committee concluded that savage made improper 
advances to a peace corps volunteer during a trip to zaire last 
march the committee said that savages conduct was contrary to a 
house rule on member conduct but recommended no punishment 
the resolution approved wednesday sponsored by rep robert 
walker rpa has no effect other than to direct the committee on 
house administration to make recommendations on changes in 
procedures for the official recording and reporting of house 
proceedings 
walker said the editing was suggested by house parliamentarian 
bill brown because of house rules prohibiting attacks on other 
members 
walker said the remarks were unparliamentary in nature and 
should not have been made but he said the larger issue was whether 
the congressional record should be edited so that it does not 
accurately reflect what is said on the floor 
members of congress frequently exercise their power to rewrite 
their spoken remarks before they are officially published in the 
congressional record and the house routinely grants speakers the 
right to extend and revise their remarks in print 
but walker and rep james f sensenbrenner jr rwis said 
that because all house proceedings are recorded on videotape the 
house should make the written record more accurate 
the time has come that we address the problem of the 
accuracy of the congressional record sensenbrenner said it 
should not happen that in the dead of night offensive words get 
xed out 
the resolution cited the editing of savages remarks and 
numerous other examples of deletions 
these omissions seriously threaten the integrity of the 
proceedings of the house the resolution said

gov neil goldschmidt announced wednesday 
that he will not run for a second term saying he and his wife have 
agreed to separate 
its certainly no time to be running for governor 
goldschmidt said at a news conference in his office it will 
require giving more of myself than i am prepared to give 
the democratic governors aides recently denied rumors there 
were any problems in the 25year marriage of goldschmidt and his 
wife margie 
goldschmidt 49 was a former portland mayor and us secretary 
of transportation under president carter after returning to 
portland in 1981 he headed canadian operations for the nike

his political career began in portland in 1970 when he was 
elected to the city commission two years later he was elected 
mayor and presided over such projects as the construction of a 
lightrail transit system

him high marks he started a regional economic development program 
and began a major expansion of the states prison system he later 
focused more on social services with a childrens agenda that 
focused on providing a wide variety of help to children 
but critics said the governors rhetoric sometimes outran his 
accomplishments and he also was criticized for not always 
following through on his initiatives 
in the past year goldschmidt has been vexed by persistent 
problems including the january 1989 slaying of corrections 
director michael francke which remains unsolved the killing 
prompted investigations into alleged corruption in the prison 
system 
he and his wife have two children joshua 20 and rebecca 17

when officials of the days inn hotel chain 
planned their annual conference they didnt have to look far for a 
nice place to put up their guests they booked a block of rooms at 
the marriott marquis 
and when the atlantabased days inns of america inc sought out 
a former president to address the gathering instead of choosing 
georgia native jimmy carter it invited his 1980 opponent ronald 
reagan 
the choice of venue was simple days inns needed about 600 rooms 
for the visiting franchise owners as well as space for meetings 
banquets more than 200 vendor exhibits and the speech by reagan 
days inns which caters to a middleclass clientele doesnt 
have a hotel in town with that kind of space 
we have quite a lot to put under one roof said debbie 
campbell the chains vice president for guest services and a chief 
planner of the threeday conference which begins thursday 
most of the days inns in the atlanta area are smaller hotels 
along interstate highways 
the downtown days inn just a short walk from the marriott has 
about 200 rooms the marriott has 1673 
ms campbell said days inns has been holding its annual 
conferences at the marquis for three years and despite the 
competitive nature of the hotel industry sees nothing odd about it 
we wouldnt be there if they didnt provide the service we 
need she said its totally different were not in the 
convention business marriott is 
she said the idea of housing guests at days inns and having the 
exhibits and other events at a convention center for example the 
cavernous georgia world congress center was rejected because 
organizers wanted everything in one place 
this is the one time all of our licensees gather under one 
roof she said we feel we lose people if we go from a hotel 
to a convention center 
day inns booking the gathering at a rival isnt really a 
surprise said dave fowler assistant director for convention 
services at the marriott marquis he said several hotel chains 
including comfort inn and quality inn have used the larger 
conventionoriented hotels for meetings 
its great for us we feel flattered that they come here he 
said 
the speech by reagan on friday will be his first visit to 
georgia since leaving office reagan also was scheduled to address 
a state republican party function saturday 
we wanted to do something that was really going to knock their 
socks off ms campbell said who better than ronald reagan 
our most recent expresident 
she would not say how much reagan was being paid for his 
appearance 
ms campbell said previous conferences have featured speakers 
from within the company 
days inns which has a stated goal to replace holiday inn as 
the standard for the middleclass traveler has experienced 
dramatic growth in the last decade 
the chain with hotels in all 50 states and four countries 
expanded from 290 hotels in 1985 to 951 last year and from 46594 
rooms in 1985 to 120725 in 1989 
the chain was bought in november by its largest franchisee 
tollmanhundley hotels in a deal that included a 90 million cash 
payment and the assumption of 675 million in debt

the pentagons military leadership has been 
told it should focus additional attention on possible regional 
threats to the arabian peninsula a senior defense department 
official said wednesday 
the guidelines are in the defense planning guidance the 
longrange planning instructions issued by defense secretary dick 
cheney to help the services prepare their budgets for 199297 
the document was due last fall but its release was delayed so 
planners could assess the changes that are sweeping the soviet 
union and eastern europe 
the senior defense department official briefed a number of 
reporters about the classified document after reports of its 
contents surfaced in the media 
asked which regional threats are possible against the nations on 
the arabian peninsula the official said the document does not cite 
nations by name but he went on to say that iraq and iran have 
significant armed forces 
the official who spoke on condition he not be identifed by 
name contended that contrary to media reports the document does 
not instruct the services to drop the mission of defending iran in 
the event of a soviet attack but rather places more emphasis on 
the arabian peninsula 
although we are focusing additional attention on the 
peninsula our policies should continue to consider the contingency 
of a soviet attack into iran the official quoted from the 
document 
the united states has had contingency plans to counter a soviet 
attack into iran since the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 
the official queried about the media reports said the document 
takes into account that usiranian relations are more 
problematic than they once were and notes that the united states 
isnt capable of mounting a defense in irans zagros mountains 
the planning document also instructs planners to assume a 
successful negotiation on conventional forces in europe will cut 
soviet forces there and that therefore us forces would have a 
much longer warning time about a massive soviet attack the 
official said 
the guidance instructs the services to plan for the possibility 
that the united states will have to give up more of its bases 
overseas and notes that asian nations such as south korea will be 
expected to assume more of their own defense burden

the first human recipient of an 
experimental lungassist device a teenager suffering from severe 
respiratory stress died wednesday 4 days after the bundle of 
fine tubes was implanted in her chest 
melicia harvey 16 of arthur city texas who had remained in 
critical condition died at 530 am of worsening pulmonary 
failure said tim madden spokesman at lds hospital 
the experimental intravascular oxygenator implanted during a 
twohour operation friday functioned properly until the girl died 
he said and the hospitals governmentapproved implants will 
continue 
there were no clinical complications from the use of the 
device which added oxygen to and removed carbon dioxide from the 
patients blood madden said in a written statement 
miss harveys identity and details of her condition had been 
kept private at her familys request until a texas newspaper the 
paris news identified her and her father atrell harvey ii with 
the familys permission madden confirmed her identity wednesday 
the girls mother edith harvey 41 had died of undisclosed 
causes on jan 31 said leon williams a spokesman for the maxey 
funeral home in paris he said funeral arrangements for the 
daughter were not complete 
miss harvey whose father is an employee of the campbell soup 
co had been a member of the student council at frank stone high 
school in paris where students were taking miss harveys death 
really really hard said linda bolton secretary to the 
principal 
the schools 740 students include miss harveys brother and 
sister bolton said counselors were called in to talk with the 
grieving students 
the ivox a 20inch bundle of hundreds of synthetic tubes about 
as fine as human hair with walls so thin that oxygen and carbon 
dioxide can pass through was designed to give damaged lungs time 
to rest and recover 
it is inserted via the neck or groin into the inferior vena 
cava the large vein that brings blood to the heart 
two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the 
bundle of tubes and lead out of the body one delivers oxygen to 
the blood while the other removes carbon dioxide 
the ivox was approved by the us food and drug administration 
in september for temporary implantation in up to 10 humans at lds 
and three other medical centers hershey medical center at 
pennsylvania state university the university of michigan medical 
center in ann arbor and the los angeles countyuniversity of 
southern california medical center 
madden said that in its most severe forms adult respiratory 
distress syndrome is fatal in 9095 percent of all cases it has a 
variety of causes and is characterized by an inability of the lung 
to transfer oxygen to the blood 
dr jd mortensen chief developer of the ivox for a company 
called cardiopulmonics inc declined to discuss miss harveys 
case but indicated her death wasnt as a surprise to doctors 
ninety percent of this group the 10 approved implants are 
expected to die he said 
mortensen said that while he and other doctors will spend months 
reviewing the case before making a final assessment early 
indications are that the ivox worked well 
there were no complications mortensen said it will take 
a long time to review the mountain of data we gathered with this 
case from what we know with this case it the ivox was extremely 
successful 
he said a second implant will be made 
were just waiting for the right case at any one of the 
centers mortensen said 
miss harvey also received conventional treatments which 
ordinarily include mechanical ventilation antibiotics and 
medications designed to remove excess fluid from the body and 
support heart function he said 
madden said no news conferences or briefings were planned 
there isnt really anything more they doctors can or will 
say he said 
before miss harvey died it was unclear how long doctors 
intended to leave the device inside her fda guidelines limit 
implants to seven days and madden had said any further use would 
require fda permission 
protocol set by the fda stipulates that the device be used on 
patients requiring 100 percent oxygen who otherwise have no better 
than a 10 percent chance of survival 
the ivox developed by salt lake citybased cardiopulmonics 
inc can satisfy as much as half of the bodys need for oxygen 
delivery and carbon dioxide elimination 
mortensen said it isnt an artificial lung but eventually could 
lead to one he has said the initial experiments will involve only 
patients with acute lung diseases like pneumonia or smoke 
inhalation not chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or 
emphysema

americans shelled out 503 billion at box 
offices across the country this past year making 1989 the most 
successful year in motion picture history the industrys chief 
spokesman reports 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america recited the glowing figures in a speech to movie 
distributors exhibitors and theater owners attending the annual 
showest exposition 
valenti said the 1989 box office take was up 83 percent from the 
1980 figure of 274 billion the number of admissions increased 
109 percent during the decade from 1022 billion in 1980 to 1133 
billion last year 
teenagers are no longer as significant a force in the industry 
as they once were valenti said dropping from 42 percent of the 
market in 1980 to 30 percent last year the over40 crowd picked up 
the slack accounting for 23 percent of all attendees last year 
compared to 13 percent in 1980 
thank god the over40s are going to the movies now valenti 
told reporters before his speech 
the movie chief said many parts of the country may see 8 ticket 
prices if inflation continues at 4 to 5 percent a year the 
average movie ticket price is now 444 valenti said 
at the opposite end of the scale valenti said there is a 
proliferation of discount theaters willing to let patrons in for 
peanuts to hawk expensive popcorn and other treats 
concessions are a major profit center for every theater 
valenti said many theaters make 81 percent profit on their 
concessions a 3 bag of popcorn costs 17 cents a 225 coke 12 
cents 
my guess is that most theaters would let people come in free 
if they could just to get the moviegoer to buy the inflated 
concessions 
while theater owners make money from the box office and the 
concession stand the film distributor earns only from the dollars 
deposited at the ticket window 
the question is whether you can cut your admission costs down 
to 50 cents or 25 cents stripping the distributor of his 
revenues valenti said it doesnt make any sense 
discount houses are growing very rapidly enticing people into 
theaters valenti said they dont care about the box office 
they want people to come in to buy the concessions 
valenti said the movie theater industry will continue to thrive 
despite television if you have a good movie and show it in a 
good clean theater 
movies remain the cheapest game in town when compared to the 
cost of events like professional sports valenti said 
actor jimmy stewart was to present a special tribute to 
universal studios tuesday night in honor of their 75th anniversary 
showest runs through thursday

a prosecutor told jurors tuesday to listen 
to the victim when they deliberate the case of a man accused of 
raping a 7yearold boy cutting off his penis and leaving him for 
dead 
but a defense lawyer emphasized discrepancies between the boys 
description of his attackers clothing and speech and those of 
defendant earl kenneth shriner 
jurors deliberated nearly four hours after receiving the case 
then retired for the night deliberations were to resume wednesday 
morning 
shriner is charged with firstdegree attempted murder and two 
counts of firstdegree rape 
judge thomas r sauriol gave the panel 20 minutes of instruction 
on the 6dayold case and said they could reduce the charges 
against shriner 
deputy prosecutor barbara coreyboulet told the pierce county 
superior court jury that the boys recall has been consistent on at 
least one fact the identity of his attacker 
the boy knows who attacked him coreyboulet said 
listen to the voice of the child 
defense lawyers lloyde alton and dino sepe called no defense 
witnesses pinning their case instead on an effort to discredit the 
boys testimony 
the child may have picked shriner from a photo montage and in 
person because of seeing him previously in the neighborhood alton 
said in his closing argument 
the boy said his attacker wore a green and white jacket with 
shiny material alton said holding up shriners dull gray 
jacket 
the child also described a fishing hat with hooks but other 
witnesses said shriner wore a white bicycle helmet that day alton 
noted 
and although the boy failed to mention anything unusual in 
shriners speech all other witnesses said shriner had a speech 
impediment 
they have focused on one individual and decided this is the 
guy alton told the jury 
the prosecutor dismissed the failure of the boy who has turned 
8 to remember some details of the may 20 attack she blamed his 
lack of recall on the shock caused by the savagery of the attack 
she said shriner lied when he told police blood on his jacket 
was from a bicycle accident laboratory tests proved the blood 
could have been the boys but was definitely not shriners 
shriner 40 has an extensive history of violence against young 
people and confinement in institutions for the retarded and 
deranged 
the attack occurred in woods near where the boy lives police 
who interviewed the boy after the attack said shriner lured him 
into the woods where he placed a yellow strap around his neck 
raped him repeatedly and cut off his penis 
an inmate in a cell near shriners testified that shriner said 
he cut off the boys penis because he refused to urinate on him 
doctors who treated the child at mary bridge childrens hospital 
said the bodys natural defense mechanisms which direct blood to 
interior organs during times of extreme fear may have saved his 
life 
the boy has undergone corrective surgery the cost of which was 
covered by a trust fund created with donations following the 
heavily publicized attack 
media coverage was so wide that the judge went 120 miles north 
to bellingham to pick a jury for the trial in tacoma 
the vicious attack galvanized public opinion in the state and 
led to a governors task force addressing the problem of sex 
predators since the attack one former sex offender has been 
arrested and charged in the deaths of three young boys in the 
portland ore area 
police in lynnwood a seattle suburb and tacoma have alerted 
the public when known sex offenders were released from detention 
and the legislature is nearing approval of a new law to crack down 
on sex predators

the testimony by janice delozier whose husband mark was one 
of the first coast guard investigators to board the ship after it 
ran aground puts hazelwood at the pipeline club more than two 
hours before the defense contends he was there 
the time element is critical in determining how much liquor 
hazelwood might have consumed before taking command of the exxon 
valdez on march 23 the night it struck a reef triggering the 
nations worst oil spill 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is being tried in superior 
court on a felony charge of seconddegree criminal mischief and 
misdemanor charges of reckless endangerment negligent discharge of 
oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated if convicted on all 
counts he could be sentenced to up to seven years three months in 
prison and 61000 in fines 
mrs delozier insisted she saw hazelwood ordering a drink around 
145 pm 
hazelwoods shipmates have testified they had lunch with him in 
valdez from 1230 to about 2 pm dropped him off in a shopping 
center near the bar and didnt see him again until about 4 pm 
when they had drinks at the bar 
the ship grounded shortly after midnight spilling more than 10 
million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound the spill 
killed thousands of birds fish and other wildlife and blackened 
hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
mrs delozier came forward about 10 days after the accident to 
say she had seen the captain at the pipeline club a valdez bar 
she said her memory had been prodded by seeing a picture of 
hazelwood in the newspaper 
my immediate reaction was wow i saw him she testified 
she recalled going to the club during a lunch break from her 
dental assistants job and said she was drinking coffee when a man 
in a peaked hat came in and ordered vodka on the rocks she said 
shes sure it was hazelwood 
mrs delozier said she told her husband who gave her two days 
to think about whether she wanted to tell authorities later she 
was interviewed by the fbi and coast guard she said while her 
husband stood by and prompted her recollections 
defense attorney michael chalos vigorously attacked her account 
noting the participation of her husband in the interview he 
focused on her statement that she didnt come forward earlier 
because she thought people might find her story fishy 
why did you think people would think it was fishy asked 
chalos 
human nature you know two deloziers my husuband got a lot 
of publicity she replied 
did you want to get publicity asked chalos 
i didnt want anything to do with it said the witness 
speaking rapidly in a thick southern accent and then there were 
the everpresent questions what were you doing in a bar 
chalos asked how come mrs delozier hadnt discussed her 
recollection with the woman who she says waited on hazelwood 
theres no how come involved snapped the witness im 
not the town crier 
the defense attorney asked if it ever occurred to mrs delozier 
she might be mistaken in identifying hazelwood 
it has occurred to me sir she said 
asked if she tried to verify her identification she said i 
didnt feel i had to 
but if you had doubts chalos said before the woman cut him 
off 
when did i say i had doubts i knew who i saw 100 percent 
she said i wouldnt be sitting here under oath if i had those 
doubts 
she acknowledged however that in an interview with a state 
police investigator last week she placed hazelwood in the bar 
between 1230 and 130 pm she said she was confused by the 
passage of time since the event

twenty alleged mobsters were indicted on charges 
including murder extortion and racketeering after an eightyear 
probe of the citys underworld us attorney general dick 
thornburgh announced wednesday 
these defendants are alleged to be major participants in the 
chicago crime syndicate thornburgh said at a news conference 
the government said those indicted by a federal grand jury were 
engaged in illegal gambling highinterest loans and the collection 
of street taxes from other criminals several are accused of 
using murder and extortion as enforcement tactics 
the indictments detail the cases of three independent bookmakers 
who balked at paying street taxes and were slain prosecutors say 
they believe the indictments represent a rare solution of 
underworld murders 
obviously this was a powerful group of individuals said 
acting us attorney ira raphaelson citing what he described as 
their ability to operate rackets for years 
those indicted raphaelson said operated as the joseph ferriola 
street crew a segment of the citys crime syndicate 
he refused to say how many street crews are believed to operate 
in chicago how big a role the ferriola crew played in the mob or 
whether the indictments were expected to reduce crime in the city 
rocco infelise 67 of suburban river forest who allegedly 
succeeded ferriola after his death last year is charged with a 
variety of offenses including murder racketeering conspiracy 
illegal gambling and tax cheating 
also charged with racketeering is salvatore delaurentis 52 of 
suburban inverness 
the fbi said infelise and delaurentis were arrested wednesday at 
ohare international airport when they arrived on a flight from 
florida of the other 18 defendants all but one had been taken 
into custody 
the government is seeking forfeiture of the homes of infelise 
and delaurentis and 37 million in proceeds from alleged 
racketeering activities 
some of defendants also are accused of conspiring to bribe 
public officials in illinois to protect the street crew and of 
planning to bribe officials in wisconsin 
raphaelson said there isnt any indication the wisconsin plans 
were realized or that any wisconsin officials knew about the plan 
the indictment alleges that three people were killed because 
they refused to pay street taxes fees to the syndicate for the 
privilege of running criminal activities 
according to the indictment anthony reitinger was fatally shot 
in chicago in 1975 robert plummer was beaten to death in the 
libertyville suburb in 1982 and hal smith was strangled in suburban 
long grove in 1985

the case of a 13yearold boy who 
authorities say has admitted sexually abusing as many as 64 
children in a church nursery is an alarming example of children who 
molest children a researcher said 
the youth admitted molesting dozens of boys and girls between 
the ages of 18 months and 4 years left at a church nursery while 
their parents attended services according to muskegon county 
juvenile court documents and juvenile court judge neil mullally 
the alleged incidents occurred between 1985 and 1988 in the 
muskegon county town of fruitport 40 miles west of grand rapids 
the boy identified in court records as david andrew hawkey 
pleaded guilty in may to seconddegree criminal sexual conduct for 
molesting a 4yearold the extent of the case became known while 
he was undergoing courtordered therapy and confessed to molesting 
other children 
in too many cases signs are ignored and adults reduce it to 
sex play or experimentation and believe theres nothing to worry 
about then you hear about something like this said dr 
toni cavanagh johnson a researcher in the field of young sex 
offenders she is not connected to the fruitport case 
david was charged this week with two counts of firstdegree 
criminal sexual conduct he is at a residential treatment center 
and if convicted of the new charges could be sentenced to remain 
in treatment until he is 19 
authorities said david was able to name 47 children and provided 
descriptions of the rest nearly all of the cases have been 
corroborated through interviews and medical examinations the judge 
said 
david was a volunteer at the fruitport bethel baptist church 
nursery supervisors were always present but authorities said the 
boy molested the children in restrooms or while babysitting at 
church members homes 
the alleged molestations ranged from fondling to rape 
authorities say 
the boys parents have refused to comment davids 17yearold 
brother paul has also been charged with firstdegree criminal 
sexual conduct for allegedly molesting a 4yearold boy at the 
church in 1988 the elder boys attorney has denied the charge 
johnson is clinical director of the support program for 
abusedreactive kids at childrens institute international a 
private nonprofit mental health facility in los angeles 
she said she has interviewed 200 children who have molested 
other children and the majority have been sexually abused and 
nearly all of them have been exposed prematurely to sexuality they 
are all extremely confused about sexuality and show an interest in 
it far beyond their age 
johnson said its hard to gauge the severity of the problem 
because so few sex offenders under the age of 14 are prosecuted and 
little data is available 
johnson who said she has seen children as young as 3 years old 
acting out sexual aggression added that children living in an 
atmosphere of violence promiscuity or neglect appear to be most 
prone to becoming sexually aggressive 
almost all of them have witnessed physical aggression at home 
they seem to have paired sex and aggression in their head she 
said in a telephone inteview tuesday 
in a 1988 report commissioned by the michigan department of 
mental health researchers found that 96 percent of all juvenile 
sex offenders are male and that the median age was 14 the median 
age of their victims was 7 
in most cases the older child knows his victim and uses 
threats coercion or violence to keep the victim from disclosing 
the crime 
in the fruitport case the boy admitted he threatened to cut his 
victims heads off with a sword or lock them in the bathroom if 
they told their parents said juvenile court caseworker debra 
jensen 
parents gradually became aware of the alleged assaults after 
some of the children began complaining of rectal pain wetting 
their beds and recreating the incidents with other children said 
the rev billie anderson pastor of the church

the sandinistadominated national 
assembly on wednesday approved amnesty for more than 1000 
political prisoners preempting a key opposition pledge less than 
three weeks before elections 
the sandinista party predicted it will win the feb 25 elections 
by a landslide and that the united states unable to ignore the 
results will move to normalize relations with sovietbacked 
nicaragua 
a landslide victory will push normalization with the united 
states read the headline on a frontpage story about the 
elections in the sandinista newspaper barricada 
nicaragua however has refused to allow a 20member us 
congressional group named by president bush to monitor the 
elections and sen richard lugar said in washington wednesday that 
the delegation was disbanded former president jimmy carter heads a 
separate observer group 
president daniel ortega seeking another sixyear term made the 
amnesty proposal last week and the national assembly rubberstamped 
it wednesday with a 764 vote 
the amnesty covers 1189 people most of them accused of taking 
part in the usbacked contra insurgency about 95 are already out 
of prison and under house arrest or restricted by conditional 
liberties 
the amnesty also covers 39 exofficers of the hated national 
guard that defended anastasio somozas rightist dictatorship which 
the sandinistas overthrew in 1979 
the prisoners are expected to be released friday and saturday 
said sandinista lawmaker danilo aguirre 
the government also freed 1984 political prisoners last april 
but the permanent commission on human rights an independent group 
claims at least 4000 more are held in prisons and jails nationwide 
ortega who has taken pains during the campaign to mend his 
often fractious relationship with the roman catholic church said 
he decided to ask for the amnesty at the urging of cardinal miguel 
obando y bravo the roman catholic archbishop of nicaragua 
freedom for political prisoners ending the military draft and 
reviving nicaraguas shattered economy are key planks in the 
platform of ortegas main opponent violeta barrios de chamorro 
publisher of the opposition newspaper la prensa and leader of the 
usbacked united national opposition 
uno a 14party coalition is the sandinistas main challenger 
in the general election 
the language in the barricada article lacked the acrimony that 
usually accompanies government comments on the united states and 
reinforced a common sandinista theme of late a desire for normal 
relations 
unlike earlier articles the story was restrained in tone and 
referred to the united states by name instead of the usual 
yankees gringo imperialist aggressors and other derogatory 
phrases 
barricada paraphrased interior minister tomas borge as saying 
the sandinistas will garner at least 70 percent of the vote in the 
elections placing them in unsurpassable conditions for the 
government of the united states not only to recognize the results 
but to start normalizing relations with nicaragua 
but while the articles main thrust was one of reconciliation 
with the united states which supports the contra rebels and 
imposed economic sanctions it also suggested the military may not 
obey a victorious opposition 
for example with the existence of the sandinista 
revolutionary armed forces how could officers obey the absurd 
orders of those who would become defense and interior ministers 
borge said at a meeting tuesday night with 1600 sandinista 
activists 
a 49 million nonlethal aid package to the contras approved by 
the us congress last year will run out shortly after the 
elections and congress has shown no inclination to renew aid to 
the rebels 
the sandinistas have thrice expelled us diplomats accusing 
them of inciting violence and engaging in plans to destabilize the 
government the united states has retaliated each time expelling 
as many nicaraguan diplomats from washington 
political observers and nonus diplomats generally agree that 
while the sandinistas have an impressive campaign machine 
widespread discontent over the economy might give uno a victory at 
the ballot box

juries awarded more than 475 million in damages 
in the nations 10 largest civil lawsuits last year but some 
attorneys say jumbo verdicts are declining as insurers and 
corporations lobby for limits on awards 
the largest verdicts came in cases of medical malpractice 
product liability wrongful firing defamation sexual abuse and 
personal injury 
half of the judgments were against corporations three were 
against city county or state governments and agencies and two 
were against individuals according to the bostonbased lawyers 
alert magazine 
the awards were topped by twin verdicts totaling more than 152 
million awarded to two factory workers in baltimore who got lung 
disease from exposure to asbestos 
in the secondlargest judgment new york citys transit 
authority was ordered to pay 58 million to a 20yearold man whose 
legs were cut off when he fell in front of a subway car 
this shows that if a corporate defendant does something that 
offends the american public theyre going to get slammed said 
larry bodine publisher of lawyers alert these juries are made 
up of regular folks and if a company gets jurors mad at them 
theyre going to get creamed 
but amid talk of a lawsuit crisis or reform of the tort system 
in which civil actions are brought for wrongful acts injury or 
damage the number of milliondollar judgments is dropping 
after peaking at 562 in 1985 the number of milliondollarplus 
awards dropped in 1986 and 1987 the last years for which complete 
figures are available according to jury verdict research inc 
i think we are seeing the effects of the tort reform movement 
seeking limits on awards and the impact of advertising by 
insurance companies saying that there is a lawsuit crisis said 
tom harrison editor of lawyers alert 
william bailey counsel for the insurance information institute 
an insurance industry trade organization said whopping judgments 
showed the law has gotten carried away 
punitive damage awards are getting bigger every year and they 
dont do any good bailey said they dont alter the 
antisocial behavior of companies that were trying to prevent 
but russ herman president of the trial lawyers association of 
america called tort reform tort deform and said it was an 
attempt by corporations to escape accountability for their actions 
this is just another way for corporate america to increase its 
profits at the cost of american justice herman said 
herman said most damage suits involved corporations suing each 
other 
most of the top 10 awards involved individual injury or death 
including 
a 30 million verdict against new york city after attorneys 
showed a 7yearold boy was paralyzed when he fell from a 15foot 
high playground sculpture 
44 million awarded when a family of four was killed when the 
gas tank of their toyota station wagon exploded in a collision 
in two suits plaintiffs were awarded damages for being 
wrongfully fired 
however just because damages are awarded doesnt mean they are 
received bodine said the status of the top 1989 awards wasnt 
available 
in many cases the full amount is never collected bodine 
said the award may be reduced on appeal or the defendant may 
just go bellyup and say i dont have the money

public schools were closed and several 
hundred blacks chanting soul power and i am somebody 
marched on city hall on wednesday to protest white leadership of 
selmas mostly black school system 
the crowd peacefully went to the city hall council chamber for 
45 minutes of prayers and speeches in support of norward roussell 
the first black school superintendent in this 1960s battleground of 
the civil rights movement 
roussell was dismissed last week by the board of education a 
majority of whose members are white but amid protests the board 
reinstated roussell and he returned to the job wednesday 
the board closed all 11 public schools in selmas 70 percent 
black 6000student system wednesday after racial tensions rose 
and there were scuffles between white and black students tuesday 
morning 
roussell announced wednesday afternoon the schools would remain 
closed thursday and until we are able to assure the safety and 
security of our students and staff 
protest leaders called on the board to extend roussells 
contract beyond june when it is set to expire they also demanded 
that blacks be given an equal voice on the school board and that 
board members be elected rather than appointed by the city 
council which also has a white majority 
indeed we must turn selma right side up and wrong side out 
demonstrator spiver gordon told the cheering crowd at city hall 
yusef salaam a legal services attorney noted that 
demonstrators came peacefully to city hall on wednesday but he 
said theres no telling how we will come tomorrow 
the dispute goes back to december when the six white members of 
the 11member board voted to let roussells 80000ayear contract 
run out in june 
they cited an evaluation critical of his managerial skills 
roussell said the evaluation was unsubstantiated and black protest 
leaders said he was being fired because he is black 
after the december vote the five black members of the board 
announced they were resigning though they have yet to sign formal 
resignation papers 
the controversy led to periodic school boycotts 
the protests turned confrontational after the board decided last 
week to remove roussell as superintendent immediately rather than 
waiting until june four blacks were arrested on misdemeanor 
charges monday after a melee at mayor joe smithermans office 
rose sanders one of the four arrested was injured wearing a 
neck brace with one arm in a sling she spoke from a wheelchair at 
a hospital wednesday saying she was hurt when she was carried 
bodily from smithermans office by police 
she said she was dragged out of the mayors office and up the 
steps of the police department smitherman has said the four were 
allowed to leave his office however they wanted and that all four 
refused to move unless carried 
mrs sanders husband democratic state sen hank sanders said 
wednesday he would use any means necessary to personally 
respond to what he described as abuse of his wife 
smitherman said he was working to resolve the school conflict 
even though he isnt officially part of the education system he 
said he was a readily available symbol for black frustrations 
after the threat of violence forced the closing of two schools 
tuesday morning the white members of the school board reinstated 
roussell as superintendent and urged the five black members of the 
board to resume work 
the reinstatement came after the interim superintendent the 
rev fd reese a black who is principal of selma high school 
announced his resignation so roussell could return to the job 
roussell met for two hours wednesday morning with principals and 
his central office staff to discuss the safety of our students 
and the security of our schools 
we are in a crisis situation he told reporters the press 
is not my priority right now my priority is getting those kids 
back in school

a man with a long record of violence toward 
young people was convicted wednesday of raping sexually mutilating 
and trying to kill a 7yearold boy during an attack in woods near 
the childs home 
the jury brought in from 120 miles away because of pretrial 
publicity deliberated 4 hours after six days of testimony 
before finding earl kenneth shriner guilty of firstdegree 
attempted murder two counts of firstdegree rape and firstdegree 
assault 
shriner looked frightened when the jury returned the verdict he 
swallowed visibly and bit his lower lip as the guilty announcements 
were read 
the jury also returned two special verdicts finding shriner used 
a deadly weapon in committing the rapes under state sentencing 
guidelines that added 8 years to the maximum sentence of 91 years 
deputy prosecutor james roche said prosecutors would ask for a 
longer sentence under rules allowing a judge to exceed the maximum 
term in extraordinary circumstances 
we want to see that he never gets out again roche said 
pierce count superior court judge thomas r sauriol set 
sentencing for march 26 
helen harlow mother of the boy said she was relieved by the 
jurys decision its over for me she said the sentencing 
is next 
the boys family sighed and wept quietly betty foote the boys 
grandmother said the child now 8 was at school and that his 
mother would tell him about the verdict when he came home 
hell be able to put all this behind him almost immediately 
ms harlow said 
dolores shriner the defendants mother left the courtroom 
quickly but later told a reporter how would you feel if you were 
his mother 
jurors signed a form saying they didnt want to speak with the 
news media after the trial 
prosecutors said shriner 40 used threats to lure the boy into 
a wooded area near their south tacoma homes then raped him orally 
and anally cut off his penis choked him with a strap or cord 
around his neck and left him for dead a jail inmate testified that 
shriner said he mutilated the boy because the youngster would not 
urinate on him 
neighbors found the boy naked bloody covered with mud and 
practically incoherent soon after the attack 
a trust fund established with donations has financed extensive 
corrective surgery for the boy but he faces more operations when 
he approaches adulthood 
defense lawyer lloyde alton did not call any witnesses 
including shriner but attacked the boys identification of his 
client 
in a 24year history of violent attacks on young people shriner 
has been confined at rainier school for the retarded western state 
hospital a mental institution and the washington corrections 
center but the jury was barred from hearing of his background 
the jury was chosen 120 miles away in bellingham because of 
pretrial publicity which also helped galvanize public sentiment 
for tougher laws on sex predators 
deputy prosecutor barbara coreyboulet and alton agreed that the 
most compelling evidence was the boys own testimony 
coreyboulet said the most consistent feature of all the boys 
accounts was his identification of shriner 
the boy knows who attacked him she told jurors listen 
to the voice of the child 
alton said the boy might have picked shriner from a police photo 
montage and later identified him in person as the attacker because 
of previous unremembered encounters in the neighborhood 
he said the boys description of his assailant consistently 
deviated from descriptions of shriner offered by other witnesses 
before and after the attack 
the boy said shriner wore a shiny green and white jacket gray 
pants and a camouflage style fishing hat with fishhooks in it and 
said nothing about shriners speech impediment 
but alton noted that a bloodstained jacket seized from shriner 
was a dull gray with maroon lining the pants he was wearing were 
blue jeans he was seen throughout the day of the attack wearing a 
white bicycle helmet 
the attack helped lead to formation of a governors task force 
on sex predators and the washington legislature is close to 
enacting the task forces recommendations including longer prison 
terms and civil commitment for incorrigible sex offenders

a 20member congressional group named by 
president bush to observe this months elections in nicaragua has 
been disbanded after members were denied visas by the leftist 
managua government sen richard lugar said wednesday 
lugar an indiana republican said president bush concurs that 
there is no chance for the group to serve its intended function of 
determining whether the feb 25 balloting is free and fair 
the nicaraguan government has remained intransigent in 
arbitrarily choosing those it wished to observe the election and 
making a point of hostility to any official us observers lugar 
said 
the white house said in a statement it was disappointed that 
sandinista stonewalling has brought this about 
the visa refusals and other actions bring into question the 
sandinista commitment to free elections these include continued 
violence and coercion against opposition activists imbalance in 
access to the media and the use of state resources to help the 
sandinista candidates said the white house statement telephoned 
to news agencies wednesday night by spokesman roman popadiuk 
politically motivated delays by the sandinistas to 
disbursement of nonpartisan campaign funds to the opposition for 
such activities as voter registration and election monitoring have 
forced cancellation or curtailment of critical election support 
programs 
the campaign funds 9 million were voted by congress to help 
all parties compete in the elections 
sandinista actions thus far are troubling but we continue to 
remain hopeful that the desires of the nicaraguan people for full 
freedom will prevail said the white house statement which said 
a free and fair election and fulfillment of other nicaraguan 
pledges offer the possibility for a stable peace in nicaragua and 
for improved relations with the united states 
at the same time former president jimmy carter who heads a 
separate observer group briefed members of the house and senate on 
his trips to nicaragua and gave a largely optimistic report about 
chances for free and fair elections 
he feels pretty good about it said lugar who attended one 
of the briefings carter believes that so far as a central 
american election goes this one is probably in the ballpark he 
said 
carter also is inviting some members of the defunct presidential 
observer group to join his team lugar said he said he and rep 
anthony beilenson dind the cochairman of the presidential 
group have declined to go 
carter told reporters he hoped that as many as 1500 
international observers would be deployed across nicaragua at 
election time to give as complete a picture as possible of how 
fairly the voting is conducted 
he acknowledged that there have been some serious problems 
most of which have been corrected an apparent reference to 
violence against opposition supporters early in the campaign season 
and to alleged sandinista footdragging in funneling us aid to 
the opposition 
lugar said he believed the denial of the visas was a foreign 
policy blunder on managuas part that squandered a chance to help 
ease relations between nicaragua and the united states 
we have a problem back here however this election comes out 
he said predicting intense us debate on how to forge a new 
relationship with nicaragua this election is a pivotal event 
congressional sources speaking only on the condition of 
anonymity said the sandinista government had signaled privately 
that three people on the 20name list were particularly 
objectionable rep henry hyde rill and sens john mccain 
rariz and connie mack rfla all strong supporters of the 
antisandinista contra rebels

prime minister margaret thatcher on wednesday 
praised the soviet communist partys vote to give up its monopoly 
on power 
further than we could ever have thought five years ago mrs 
thatcher said a lot still to be done but a great decision a 
great decision 
mrs thatcher spoke to reporters outside her 10 downing st 
office standing alongside the soviet communist partys ideology 
chief vadim a medvedev who arrived for a sixday visit 
medvedev a member of the soviet politburo flew into london 
shortly after the vote in moscow and said the decision opens up a 
new page in perestroika 
during an hour of talks with the prime minister downing street 
officials said he gave her a long and substantial message from 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that marked increasingly 
close relations between their nations 
medvedev heads a sevenmember delegation invited by british 
lawmakers 
perestroika is the term gorbachev uses for his program of 
restructuring the soviet economy and society 
medvedev said perestroika in britishsoviet relations began when 
mrs thatcher and gorbachev first met in 1984 a few months before

atampt said wednesday that researchers at its 
bell laboratories have confirmed the existence of 
quasicrystals a new and muchdebated form of matter that 
could be used to improve electronic equipment 
scientists in university and private research say xrays and 
other techniques have already helped prove quasicrystals exist 
but say bell labs research gives the most straightforward 
description of the matter 
discovered in 1984 quasicrystals have been the focus of some 
of the most intense study in the scientific community along with 
superconductivity and cold fusion say scientists familiar with the 
subject 
researchers praised bell labs announcement but said it could 
not be considered a breakthrough as the company claimed 
paul horn director of physical science at international 
business machines thomas j watson research center in yorktown 
ny called the development a nice piece of science but he 
said it didnt tell us anything we didnt expect 
while research has revealed the presence of quasicrystals in 
bulk form bell labs provided the first glimpse of a quasicrystal 
surface helping refute arguments that previous manifestations were 
a quirk of nature said lionel kimmerling who heads bell labs 
materials interface research department in murray hill west of 
newark 
the company used a scanningtunnelling miscroscope which is 
exact enough to probe individual atoms researchers cut atoms on a 
plane and used the microscope to move a finetipped probe over the 
surface the image of each atom was then projected on a television 
screen said kimmerling 
its the first time that people have used a 
scanningtunnelling microscope to get an image of the surface of 
the material horn said it confirms what people believed and 
what people had very good evidence for 
the three states of matter are solid liquid and gas the solid 
state is divided into amorphous or unorganized solids such as 
glass and crystal which includes rocks and metals the 
quasicrystal in this case composed of an alloy of aluminum 
cobalt and copper falls in between the two known categories of 
solids 
bell labs finding was published in the jan 8 edition of 
physical review letters the journal of the american physical 
society 
its definitely in the revolutionary category said 
kimmerling now we have a new material and were anxious to find 
out what it will do that substances not structured like this cannot 
do 
the outlook for uses of quasicrystals is mixed 
atampt officials said the material used to make quasicrystals is 
durable lightweight and can withstand a range of temperatures 
qualities valuable in making electrical fuses and resistors 
but kimmerling said any practical uses of the technology are 
years away 
i dont think were ready at this point to say this is 
where the technological impact is going to be said earle ryba 
an associate professor of metallurgy at penn state university 
bell labs research also shows quasicrystals to have an 
arrangement of atoms with a pentagonshaped symmetry which many 
scientists doubted could happen perfect fivesided shapes could 
not fit together without holes and breaks but the quasicrystal 
shows pentagons of many shapes and sizes comprising the atoms atampt 
officials said 
what they have done is provide more direct experimental proof 
that this in fact happens said robert metzger a professor of 
chemistry and a crystallographer at the university of alabama in 
tuscaloosa ala 
beforehand the experimental process used was a longrange 
look at the pattern metzger said now they have confirmed it 
in exact detail

the judge in the assault trial of reputed mob 
boss john gotti interrupted jury deliberations wednesday evening 
amid reports the jurors were fighting among themselves 
acting justice edward mclaughlin dismissed the jury for the 
night ordering them to return thursday 
i ask you to continue to listen mclaughlin said you 
havent really been at it all that long 
the jury is deliberating assault and conspiracy charges against 
gotti 49 and codefendant anthony guerrieri 61 
they are charged with commissioning the westies an 
irishamerican gang to shoot john f oconnor former vice 
president of carpenters union local 608 on may 7 1986 he was 
wounded in the buttocks and survived 
prosecutors claim gotti alleged boss of the gambino crime 
family arranged the shooting because oconnor ordered thugs to 
trash bankers and brokers a mobrun restaurant that was being 
built with nonunion labor 
the judge addressed the jurors after they sent out a note about 
630 pm indicating problems in their deliberations 
i wouldnt know whats going on in there but questioning 
somebodys lineage or intelligence is not the way to come to 
grips with the problem mclaughlin said 
jury service is a give and take as gently as possible the 
judge said its not a contest to see who can get in the most 
cutting triumphant gibe at the end 
the jurys note which the judge read from the bench said i 
feel we have a juror who has brought a previous bias into this 
room please advise this juror has indicated he had some opinion 
on guilt or innocence before the trial started 
notes to the judge normally are sent out by the jury foreman but 
the judge refused to say who had sent it out and who had signed it 
the note didnt contain any reference about anyones lineage or 
intelligence 
the judge declined to answer reporters questions about that 
but there was an indication that mclaughlin had heard the reference 
about lineage and intelligence from another source 
earlier wednesday the judge refused a defense motion for a 
mistrial based on a report that some jurors would agree to talk to 
reporters at a news conference after the verdict sources said 
in asking for a mistrial defense attorney bruce cutler said 
were concerned that theyre more worried about becoming media 
stars then in being jurors 
the case is based on secretly recorded tapes 
they include conversations in which gotti allegedly says 
were gonna gonna bust him up and another on which members of 
the westies gang allegedly say they shot oconnor as a favor to 
gotti 
the defense has ridiculed the tapes as inaudible and claims 
prosecutors transcribed them to suit their theory that gotti had 
oconnor shot 
the prospect of a mistrial arose earlier when one of the 12 
jurors was taken to a doctor at midday wednesday as jurors broke 
for lunch if that juror were too ill to continue an alternate 
could replace him or her only with the consent of the defense the 
defense almost certainly would object 
if convicted gotti could face 25 years to life in prison as a 
persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and 1974 
his attorneys contend gotti is being persecuted because of his 
reputation 
the judge told the jury they could convict the defendants only 
if the prosecution proved they arranged the shooting and not simply 
because they might be members of organized crime

the government said thursday the communist party 
will not give up its leading role in society and that the nation 
would descend into chaos without the party in control 
the strongly worded editorial in the partys official peoples 
daily came a day after the soviet communist party voted to end its 
constitutional guarantee of power 
the peoples daily editorial was a rejoinder to events in the 
socialist world although it made no mention of the soviet union or 
east europe where the communist parties of other nations already 
have allowed multiparty politics 
instead it attacked western democracies as being playthings of 
the rich 
chinas conservative leaders have suppressed all dissent and 
criticism of the communist party since calling in the military to 
crush the studentled democracy movement in june 
leaders reportedly are deeply concerned that events in eastern 
europe and the soviet union could rejuvenate popular opposition to 
the government 
the commentary was pegged to a party document made public 
wednesday that urged the party to pay greater attention to the 
opinions of eight tiny and tame democracy parties allowed to 
exist after the communist takeover in 1949 
the main thrust however was that a westernstyle multiparty 
system can never be accepted in china and the communist party will 
always have a constitutionally guaranteed right to lead the nation 
in china without the strong leadership of the communist 
party new turmoil and wars would surely arise the nation would be 
split and the people not to mention state construction would 
suffer again the editorial said 
it said party rule was endorsed and supported by the whole 
nation rather than proclaimed by the party 
the elite who stirred up the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion the official term for the studentled prodemocracy 
movement sought to deprive the party of its leading role it said 
some people always think that the parliamentary democracy in 
the west is advantageous the editorial said 
but it said western democracies were controlled by the rich and 
the broad masses of working people have never had the right to 
take part in the administration of state affairs those who 
have more money will have more freedom and have more right to talk 
in the democracy such democracy means nothing to those who do not 
have enough to eat 
the editorial called on the party leadership to study the 
document released wednesday which said chinas small political 
parties and noncommunists should get more legislative and 
bureaucratic positions and have a voice in policymaking 
the party has always stressed the consultative role of its 
united front the small parties mass organizations the army 
and regional groups but the communists have all leadership 
positions and absolute decisionmaking power 
the eight small parties have about 300000 members most of whom 
are leftist intellectuals from pre1949 days many now in their 
80s 
the communist party has 48 million members 
all of the small parties pledge allegiance to communist party 
rule and in the past four decades no new parties have been 
recognized

president bush said wednesday he believed a 
reunified germany could remain part of nato perhaps a nato 
somewhat different from todays alliance 
i think it can be managed in such a way that it will not bea 
threat to western europe or the free world bush told the san 
francisco commonwealth club 
meanwhile bush invited manfred woerner secretary general of 
the north atlantic treaty organization and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl to meet with him separately on the reunification issue 
woerner will visit bush at the presidential retreat at camp 
david md this weekend white house aides said 
kohl will confer at camp david later this month with bush the 
white house announced 
bush told his audience that when he heard both kohl and west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher talking about a 
germany that remains tied in to nato in some way maybe not the 
nato in exactly the same form it is but thats encouraging 
bush said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater afterward said in 
an elaborating statement that bush meant that germany would 
remain as a member of nato but nato may have a changing mission 
the changing mission would involve an increased political role 
for nato fitzwater said 
apparently worried that bushs words might be used by advocates 
of a unified germany outside the western alliance top officials 
hastened to reinforce fitzwaters footnote during the presidents 
flight to omaha neb on air force one 
national security adviser brent scowcroft told reporters on the 
plane the president said something which could be interpreted as 
being ambiguous about germany remaining a part of nato both 
chancellor kohl and foreign minister genscher have said a 
reunififed germany ought to be a part of nato we strongly support 
that view 
with white house chief of staff john sununu at his elbow 
scowcroft added that the role of the western military alliance may 
change he said if the security situation continues to change in 
europe then nato may take on more of a political character 
leaving unspoken the notion that the military character of nato 
would be less 
secretary of state james a baker iii is now in moscow 
reportedly carrying the outline of an allied plan on german 
reunification 
one of the major stumbling blocks to union of the two germanys 
is western insistence that germany stay in the north atlantic 
treaty organization the alliance forged after world war ii to 
defend against attack from the communist east bloc the soviets and 
its allied states formed the warsaw pact in response but now that 
military pact appears to be disintegrating 
the white house in a statement said the feb 2425 visit by 
kohl will provide an opportunity for the president and the 
chancellor to exchange views about prospects for german 
reunification eastwest relations possibilities for further 
progress in arms control objectives for the conference on security 
and cooperation in europe assistance to the emerging 
democracies of eastern europe and us relations with the european 
community 
east german prime minister hans modrow has called for a unified 
germany that would be neutral siding with neither nato nor the 
warsaw pact genscher has floated the idea of united germany in 
nato with nato troops barred from what is now east germany where 
soviet troops might remain for a time 
baker reportedly was told by vaclav havel the new president of 
czechoslovakia during a visit to prague tuesday thatgerman 
neutrality was out of the question 
bush administration officials have suggested lately that the 
united states might accept a reunified germany with ties to 
nato but not formal membership

five years in prison and a 5000 fine said florida department of 
law enforcement spokesman mike mchargue 
ive done no wrongdoing ms tucker said after she 
surrendered to authorities and was released on her own 
recognizance i wish theyd just let me get on with my life 
ms tucker 46 had headed the department of revenue since june 
1988

twenty gallons of heavy water spilled at the 
savannah river nuclear weapons plant wednesday sending a plume of 
radioactive tritium into the air but there was no threat to 
workers or area residents officials said 
two workers at the savannah river site who were splashed with 
the water received small doses of radidation about the equivalent 
of half a chest xray officials said 
crews were unable to detect radioactivity at the plant or along 
its boundaries said dennis stevenson manager of health protection 
operations for westinghouse savannah river co which operates the 
plant for the us department of energy 
tritium is a highly radioactive gas used in the production of 
nuclear warheads and is manufactured only at the savannah river 
plant 
the spill occurred at 1205 am while two workers were 
replacing a flange or connecting joint on water pipes to heat 
exchangers on the k reactor one of three reactors at srs shut down 
for safety modifications in 1988 
about five gallons of water runoff is expected when replacing a 
flange and officials said they were uncertain why 20 gallons was 
in the pipe 
operations at the plant were back to normal less than eight 
hours after the spill and cleanup was expected to be completed by 
the end of the day said john patterson deputy director of 
doesavannah river reactor restart special projects office 
the spill was first declared an alert at 220 am but was 
downgraded to an unusual event at 541 am the doe said an 
unusual event is the lowest of four nuclear emergency classes 
as the area where the spill occurred was ventilated through the 
reactor stack monitoring equipment detected the tritium release 
which triggered the alert said charles peckinpaugh deputy general 
manager of reactor operations 
a small amount of tritium 825 curies was released into the 
atmosphere stevenson said 
based on weather conditions the projected radiation dose at the 
plant boundary was 003 millirem about oneonethousandth of the 
dose you would get from natural background radiation he said 
one worker was exposed to 10 millirem of radiation the 
equivalent of half the radiation emitted during a normal chest 
xray officials said they said the second worker received about 
the same amount of radiation but had no figures 
about 100 other employees were in the reactor at the time but 
were not evacuated officials said 
patterson said westinghouse and doe would conduct a joint 
investigation of the incident 
the k reactor is expected to be the first of the plants three 
reactors to be restarted once safety modifications are completed 
possibly before the end of the year

the communist party that for decades swore its red 
tide would cover the globe bowed to a very different revolution 
wednesday agreeing to let alternative political parties compete 
for control of the soviet union 
that amounts to an acknowledgement that new political forces 
have taken root and no longer is possible or desirable to stamp 
them out with past tactics of repression that ranged from mass 
murder under josef stalin to the arrests and imprisonment preferred 
by leonid i brezhnev 
the party does not assume full government authority vice 
president anatoly i lukyanov told a news conference reading from 
notes on the final wording adopted by the party central committee 
its role is to be a political leader with no particular role 
to be included in the constitution he said the party will 
propose repeal of article 6 which guarantees the communists a 
monopoly of power 
there will be a multiparty system there will be a normal 
democracy svyatoslav fyodorov a noted eye surgeon and a 
participant said in an interview on red square during a break in 
the closed meeting he called the move fantastic 
the nearly unanimous vote on the new party platform was a 
triumph of political maneuvering for president mikhail s 
gorbachev he packed the meeting of the 249member committee with 
more than 700 other officials many of them progressives who took 
the floor to demand radical reform 
in two votes first by the central committee and then by all 
present only dissident communist boris n yeltsin voted against 
the platform which a central committee source said also calls for 
direct election of the president 
yeltsin who addressed a huge crowd sunday that marched to the 
kremlin to demand reform favored an even more radical program that 
demanded a virtual apology by the party for decades of totalitarian 
rule 
gorbachev has struggled nearly five years to transform the 
soviet union into something resembling a modern democracy he 
dropped his longstanding public opposition to alternative 
political parties only three weeks ago in lithuania so it was a 
surprise when he proposed monday that the policy be put into law 
asked if gorbachev got his way brent scowcroft president 
bushs national security adviser said in washington well it 
seems that way the outcome is pretty much based on the proposals 
that gorbachev introduced in the central committee 
gorbachevs close politburo ally alexander n yakovlev said at 
the news conference wednesday the move had been under consideration 
for some time 
you dont really need much acumen to realize that if we are 
venturing on the path of democratization of the country it is 
bound to affect all sociopolitical movements yakovlev said 
if we were to say in 1985 come on folks go ahead and set up 
154 parties i can imagine the mess it would have brought about 
he said 
yakovlev said the soviet leaders had to reckon with their 
nations history including its democratic and antidemocratic 
cultures 
unlike eastern europe where alternative political groups have 
existed for years and quickly became genuine opposition parties 
the soviet union has no national alternative to the communists the 
party also has great financial resources and controls much of the 
press 
because of those factors voters are unlikely to oust the 
communists from their actual power monopoly immediately except in 
regions like the baltic republics that have strong local political 
movements 
constitutional changes must be approved by the supreme soviet 
legislature which convenes next wednesday and the larger congress 
of peoples deputies the congress is to meet in the spring but 
could be called into special session 
at its last meeting in december the congress heeded gorbachevs 
plea for delay and blocked an effort by reformers to repeal article 
6 of the constitution 
the soviet union already is in the midst of campaigning for 
local and regional elections spread over the next three months and 
the central committee decision could cause a frenzy of organizing 
we communists are not going to surrender our positions just 
as any party in the world we shall be waging a struggle for our 
rights politburo member vitaly i vorotnikov told visiting 
brazilian legislators the official news agency tass reported 
yakovlov said this does not mean the political situation is 
out of control this does not mean that we cannot lead the people 
instead he said it puts the party back in front leading the 
way to democratic reform 
he acknowledged the central committee argument was stormy but 
said the final version was essentially gorbachevs 
a large portion wanted to retain article 6 and others 
favored barring certain kinds of parties he said yakovlev said 
the final platform called for banning only groups that condone 
ethnic strife or violent overthrow of the government 
the central committee also decided to advance the date of the 
next party congress from october to the end of june 
for the first time delegates will be elected by the nations 20 
million communists not chosen by the leadership 
yakovlev said the congress would elect a new central committee 
and could either choose the party leader now gorbachev or let the 
rankandfile do so 
reformers see the committee as the bastion of conservatives wary 
of gorbachevs program the congress would give gorbachev another 
chance to alter the committee 
pavel zinoviev party chief for the kamchatka peninsula in the 
soviet far east said the committee recognized a small loyalist 
faction of lithuanian communists as the true party in the baltic 
republic 
he told reporters the central committee appealed to a larger 
group of lithuanian communists who declared themselves independent 
to return to the fold before the congress implying they could not 
send delegates otherwise 
officials at the news conference indicated the platform made no 
change in the partys opposition to private land ownership

president rafael leonardo callejas 
on wednesday described relations with washington as excellent 
but said he will not allow the united states to have a permanent 
base in honduras 
the united states has conducted joint military maneuvers with 
honduras since 1954 and has stationed 1200 men at palmerola air 
base since 1984 on a rotating basis but has no permanent 
installation 
the position of my government is very clear we are not 
willing to establish permanent us military bases in our 
territory callejas said at a news conference 
callejas who took office jan 27 after winning elections in 
november emphasized all of this is framed in the honduran 
governments foreign policy 
for two years washington has been pressuring honduras to sign 
an agreement that would allow improvements at palmerola 50 miles 
northeast of tegucigalpa 
we will not negotiate with the united states about installing 
permanent bases callejas said military maneuvers between the 
united states and honduras have a temporary not permanent 
character 
the united states and honduras have had joint military maneuvers 
for 26 years since then more than 100000 us soldiers have 
participated in 80 maneuvers with the honduran armys 22000 men 
these operations serve to improve the defensive capacity of 
our army and our national security callejas said relations 
between the united states and honduras remain unchanged and 
excellent 
during the campaign last year both callejas and the candidate of 
the governing liberal party carlos flores were ustrained 
engineers with relatively conservative economic views and prous 
foreign policies but opposed to making palmerola a permanent us 
base

president augusto pinochet said wednesday 
he will remain as army commander as long as necessary after 
relinquishing the presidency next month because of the threat of 
the marxist germ 
pinochet told a group of women in iquique 1150 miles north of 
the capital that the danger of marxism has diminished as a result 
of the democratic changes in eastern europe 
but he added we still have to be careful because this 
threat can persist the marxist germ is the danger and women must 
always be alert 
pinochet is in iquique as part of a nationwide farewell tour he 
organized under the motto mission accomplished 
he told the women that some leftist exiles who have recently 
returned from exile are planning to kill him 
they have returned with hatred and i understand that he 
said they want to kill me and i also understand that they say 
they have sentenced me i thank them for the information but i 
know things are like that and i am not afraid 
pinochet survived an assasination attempt in september 1986 but 
six of his bodyguards were killed 
several leftist guerrillas who participated in that attack 
escaped from a santiago prison last week and one victor diaz caro 
sent a recorded tape to local newspapers saying the death 
sentence of pinochet is still pending 
pinochet who seized power in a 1973 coup that toppled elected 
marxist president salvador allende is scheduled to relinquish the 
presidency on march 11 to patricio aylwin a centrist leader who 
won a landslide election victory in december 
pinochet was obliged to call the election after losing a 
referendum in october 1988 on a military proposal to extend his 
rule until 1997 
the 74yearold general called the 1973 coup not only a 
national victory but a world victory we were the first ones to 
defeat marxism and we now see that our desires and aspirations are 
the same desires and aspirations of the eastern european peoples 
who are throwing away the communist yoke 
the 1980 constitution written by his military regime allows 
pinochet to remain as head of the powerful 65000men army for 
eight more years after stepping down from the presidency 
he has vowed to stay dismissing a plea by aylwin to retire 
in a facetoface meeting last december aylwin told pinochet

a federal jury on wednesday convicted 
a florida attorney in the 1988 disappearance of a jackson 
multimillionaires wife 
the jury found newton alfred winn 65 guilty of one count each 
of conspiracy to kidnap extortion and perjury around 6 pm after 
about 3 of deliberations 
winn sat impassively as the jurors were polled 
in closing arguments earlier in the day the prosecution said 
the st petersburg fla attorney blamed his financial woes on 
annie laurie hearins husband 
he had a motivation of revenge assistant us attorney 
patricia bennett said after telling jurors jury how and why the 
government claimed winn abducted the woman on july 26 1988 
defense attorneys said the government has the wrong man john 
collette one of winns attorneys said an appeal was likely 
winn is accused of conspiracy in having a ransom letter mailed 
from atlanta on aug 11 1988 he also is charged with extortion 
and lying to a federal grand jury about his knowledge of the case 
no one has been charged with actually abducting mrs hearin 
the 74yearold mrs hearin wife of robert hearin hasnt been 
seen since she disappeared from her jackson home following a bridge 
party with friends doctors have said the woman had a health 
problem that required daily medication 
after the verdict was read the womans son robert hearin jr 
said the family had been informed that the search for mrs hearin 
was still active 
the investigation into whatever happened to my mother is 
continuing and on that basis i am pleased with the result reached 
today 
us district judge tom s lee gave final instructions to the 
jurors explaining each of the three counts of the indictment 
against winn 
on hand for instructions and final arguments were two key 
government witnesses don ward who once worked for winn and 
marilyn taylor who describes herself as a onetime lover of the 
defendant and who has testified that she mailed a letter which 
prosecutors say was a ransom note 
a splattering of blood was found on the front door of the hearin 
home along with another ransom note demanding that hearin reimburse 
12 individuals including winn for losses they suffered in 
dealings with school pictures of mississippi inc a firm in which 
winn was once a primary stockholder 
winn blamed mr hearin for all of his problems with school 
pictures bennett said 
this case is about the kidnapping of annie laurie hearin 
bennett said this case is about this defendant conspiring to 
kidnap her this case is about this defendant causing a letter to 
be mailed from atlanta for the return of mrs hearin this case is 
about this defendant lying under oath 
defense attorney ed marger describing the case as having a 
perry mason scenario charged that the government based its 
case on questionable witnesses and physical evidence that 
prosecutors later attempted to downplay 
during seven days of testimony jurors were treated to a soap 
operastyle plot that included a twostate love affair between 
winn 65 and taylor 29 of de land fla taylor testified she 
disguised herself and mailed the ransom note and said she and winn 
once plotted to kill her former husband mark phillips 
in his closing arguments marger repeatedly attacked the 
credibility of taylor who testified after receiving immunity from 
prosecution 
he also said tapes of converstions between winn and taylor made 
by the fbi and introduced into the trial revealed nothing other 
than the defendant saying such things as i dont know what you 
are talking about 
marger said the truth is what this case is all about but so 
is proof

several roman catholic scholars have 
criticized a vaticanissued draft of a proposed universal catechism 
that has been distributed to bishops for their reactions 
following a symposium the scholars told a news conference there 
were serious deficiencies in the document particuarly in failing 
to make distinctions between essential truths of faith and 
peripheral elements 
the 430page document is intended as a comprehensive summary of 
catholic beliefs 
lawrence cunningham a theology professor at the university of 
notre dame said one of the documents most glaring weaknesses 
is that it suffers from what computer people would call an 
information overload lacking guidance on whats more 
important and whats less important

ask 10000 people what or who had the most 
positive influence on their religious faith and the most likely 
answer for every age group men and women boys and girls is my 
mother 
that which traditional sentiment always has assumed is among 
the findings of one of the largest most comprehensive studies ever 
made of faith and its development among americans 
a full report of the 3year study wont be disclosed until a 
national conference march 2427 in st louis but some of its 
conclusions are being circulated and discussed 
while it turned up numerous previously indicated conditions 
some of them when laid out in hard overwhelming statistics come 
as a bit of a shocker 
one of these is that only a third of us protestants have what 
is termed an integrated faith that embraces both basic beliefs 
and their practical implications in life 
another somewhat surprising conclusion is that what matters most 
in building mature faith is not the commonly emphasized classes for 
the young important as they are but adult christian education 
further this most important stage of learning is found to be 
widely neglected in the churches 
the huge landmark study involving completion of 374question 
questionnaires by 10000 church people bringing out information 
never available before about beliefs and values was made by the 
search institute of minneapolis 
it was sponsored by six mainline protestant denominations 
through a grant from the lilly endowment inc 
titled effective christian education a national study of 
protestant congregations the project also probed the methods 
programs and activities of congregations in conducting educational 
work 
in addition trained observers visited 54 congregations with 
exceptionally strong educational programs to examine and describe 
the techniques that are getting results 
peter benson president of the institute that made the study 
said it found that faith is not particulary welldeveloped in 
many church members and programs to develop it are less than 
effective 
unless this issue is faced headon in the early 90s members 
will increasingly drop away or seek spiritual nurture elsewhere 
he writes in the lutheran organ of the evangelical lutheran church 
in america 
it and other denominations involved in the study have been 
declining in membership for about 20 years 
the others are the united methodist church presbyterian church 
usa united church of christ episcopal church and christian 
church disciples of christ 
in the study faith was examined in two basic dimensions one 
called vertical involving personal relationship to god and 
the other horizontal involving active commitment to social 
service and justice 
about a third of church members scored low on both dimensions 
reflecting an undeveloped faith both in belief and in 
translating it into action 
another third showed a onedimensional faith usually holding 
firm beliefs but not seeking much application in life 
only a third were found to have a balance of both dimensions a 
mature integrated faith 
there is evidence of great hesitance to connect ones faith to 
ones community work or politics writes benson combine this 
with the reluctance to talk about ones faith and it seems that 
many adults hold a private faith 
they are unsure how to go public in words or actions 
for many faith lies dormant waiting for nudges 
inspirations revelations and personal experiences to help it 
develop it is private and quiet more in the head than the heart 
and hands and feet uncomfortable in its dormancy but afraid to let 
go 
despite the twothirds found with onedimensional or undeveloped 
faith the study found that the proportion of those with a mature 
integrated faith increases with age from youth onward 
also women were found to have a higher faith level than men 
the study also found that growth in mature faith depended not so 
much on the warmth and friendliness of a congregation but on the 
degree to which it challenges thinking and encourages questions 
of such stimulating programs benson writes 
members are challenged to think discuss debate and even 
argue about the stuff of faith including values theological 
issues politics and scripture there is active intellectual 
engagement 
benson and carolyn h eklin the institutes director of survey 
services said one reason church members rarely named christian 
education as significantly influencing them is theyve had so 
little of it 
in a years time adults average a total of no more than 11 to 
20 hours in christian educational efforts 
consequently it scarcely got a mention when people were asked 
to choose among 30 potential influences the five with the most 
postive impact on their faith 
below the topranked my mother men ranked their spouse 
father pastor and worship services while women listed gods 
presence worship prayer and last their father

tucked away in president bushs budget theres 
a proposal that would give the white house power to trim and tailor 
federal spending and tax bills with itemized vetoes it isnt going 
to happen 
but it revives a handystandby issue for the republican 
administration bush and ronald reagan have been campaigning for 
years for changes in the way the government decides how much to 
spend and how to spend it 
earlier in our history there was an unwritten law that the 
annual budget should be balanced except in time of war or 
depression according to the new bush administration budget 
that law is no longer honored and only a change in the 
constitution is likely to assure a return to habitually balanced 
budgets 
bush wants a balanced budget amendment and another to give 
presidents the power to veto specific items in an appropriations 
bill without rejecting the whole bill his budget says that also 
should apply to bills that authorize federal programs with 
automatic spending provisions 
and he wants presidents to have the same authority over revenue 
measures which means tax bills 
all of that would change the balance of legislative power item 
vetoes could be overridden by twothirds votes in both houses of 
congress but a congressional majority could no longer force a 
president to accept something he doesnt want in order to get 
things he seeks thats the kind of forced compromise that goes on 
every session and it may indeed be one of the reasons the federal 
budget has been balanced only once in the past 30 years but it 
also would cede powers that no congress is likely to yield to the 
executive branch that goes double for a democratic congress in the 
era of republican presidencies 
the president as representative of the general interest 
should have the power to strike from legislation provisions that 
reflect only narrow local or special interests the 
administration argues the democrats arent about to accept the 
premise that the president represents the national interest while 
congress caters to parochial special interests 
not that it isnt true at times but so is the reverse and the 
debate about which are special and which are national interests is 
part of the political process 
fortythree state governors have the lineitem veto power bush 
wants bestowed on presidents but state laws vary and most of them 
provide ways to settle differences on veto targets through 
reconsideration and compromise 
the white house said last fall that bush might try to exercise 
the power without a change in the law or the constitution just to 
see if it would work democrats replied that they would challenge 
any such action in court 
the supreme court never has addressed the question directly but 
it did rule in 1975 that richard m nixon had exceeded his 
authority when he refused to spend funds congress had appropriated 
for state water pollution projects 
the bush budget seems to concede that it cant be done under 
current law saying that the time has come to amend the 
constitution and achieve this change 
the balanced budget amendment doesnt quite match its name the 
version the administration pushed during the reagan years would 
make deficits more difficult but would not necessarily end them 
it would require threefifths votes of both house and senate to 
approve deficit spending except in time of war 
reagan made the balanced budget amendment a major repeating 
issue during his two terms while federal deficits were soaring 
the senate approved it once and came close a second time both 
while republicans held the control they lost in the 1986 elections 
reagan never could get it to a house vote 
bush advocates a balanced budget amendment with a builtin 
renewal of his central campaign pledge it should include 
safeguards against achieving the balance through higher taxes 
fortynine states require balanced budgets vermont is the lone 
exception the requirement is written into 42 state constitutions 
the rest have balanced budget laws state rules and enforcement 
provisions vary widely 
in a study published by the conservative heritage foundation 
budget analyst stephen moore says the federal government should 
enact statestyle spending and deficit restraints because the 
states have demonstrated that they can work 
a 1985 law requires automatic spending cuts if the government 
fails to meet deficit reduction goals but both congress and the 
administration have used loopholes and gimmicks to meet the target 
estimates and actual deficits have exceeded the limits every year 
anyhow 
nevertheless moore said that law has helped restrain deficits 
and the other measures would serve the same purpose 
the federal budget process suffers from too little discipline 
not too much he said

the simpsons five popeyed suburbanites 
with funny overbites and bad hair could become americas favorite 
tv family and the biggest primetime cartoon hit since the 
flintstones 
unquestionably fox has a hit of the first magnitude said 
david marans media research chief for j walter thompson 
advertising it even could outshine foxs other hit married 
with children he said 
the fox broadcasting cartoon series shown on sunday nights is 
as the monty python gang used to say something completely 
different 
homer simpson is an accidentprone supervisor at the local 
nuclear power plant martha is his unenlightened hausfrau lisa is 
a good little girl bart is a preteen rebel and maggie well 
maggie sucks on her pacifier 
they bear no resemblance to those stone age suburbanites fred 
and wilma flintstone who came to prime time in 1960 from 
hannabarbera productions and stayed for six years then lived on 
through syndication 
the simpsons blunder through a surreal suburbia with a vague 
sense that something is wrong in the republic a key theme of their 
creator life in hell cartoonist matt groening rhymes with 
complaining as he has noted 
not everyone is comfortable with its satire of american culture 
but its wellanimated with colors that glow and dazzle and the 
cutting humor underlines a basic affection for things simpsonian 
it is clever writing 
its also clever programming said betsy frank a senior media 
analyst for the giant saatchi and saatchi advertising conglomerate 
because it appeals to the young hip audience that fox so very much 
wants to attract 
ms frank said fox deserves its reputation for taking risks with 
the simpsons and other unconventional programs 
granted they had not a lot to lose she said but this is 
certainly a risk thats paid off for them 
the simpsons began dec 11 as the no 1 show in its early 
primetime sunday slot in the key demographic groups of adults 18 
to 49 teenage boys and girls and children said fox 
entertainment group president peter chernin 
the only thing it wasnt no 1 in was adults 55 and over 
chernin said i think this looks like a big hit show 
the shows christmas special helped lead fox to its 
highestrated sunday evening on feb 4 the simpsons beat 
competing abc and nbc sitcoms in its time period finishing a 
distant second to cbs murder she wrote which is aimed at 
older viewers 
the simpsons has done better among men 18 to 49 than such 
notable hits as golden girls bill cosby la law and 60 
minutes marans said whats really impressive about this is 
that fox isnt available in about 12 percent of the country 
i dont think we expected to do quite this well chernin 
said 
indeed its heady stuff for a company that as he put it had 
trouble premiering a show to a 10 share 10 percent of the 
audience in a given time period 
running against the jan 28 super bowl blowout the simpsons 
had a 17 share and it consistently has placed in the high teens or 
low 20s i would be thrilled if it keeps at the same level 
chernin said 
the simpsons began life as bumpers brief segments that 
cushioned the commercials on the tracey ullmann show but it 
was announced last march that the cartoon family would venture out 
on its own 
john rohr a programming consultant for blair television which 
represents 145 television stations said its too early to tell 
whether the simpsons is a hit i think that its still being 
sampled he said 
i am encouraged by the numbers rohr said certainly you 
feel a lot better seeing big numbers early on than you do by seeing 
small numbers 
several major animation houses most notably the disney studios 
and hannabarbera have primetime animation projects in the 
works but are not discussing them 
when a program is extremely innovative you run the risk that 
its going to peak ms frank said citing miami vice the 
pastelhued police drama that built an audience in its first two 
seasons then steadily declined 
as long as the writing stays good she said i cant see 
why it wouldnt perform like any good situation comedy because 
thats absolutely all that it is a situation comedy that happens 
to be animated

the trouble with many young tv executives is 
that they revert to their happy childhood memories when the ratings 
dragon roars bring back the old shows they think and the bad 
dragon will go away 
this might explain why cbs which will unleash a new love 
boat movie monday and plans a tv movie based on the green 
acres series is offering a tv movie tonight about the brady 
bunch of yesteryear the bradys 
this allamerican clan already has been in two series and one 
shortlived variety series isnt that enough nooo they had a 
christmas movie two years ago and it made the ratings dragon go 
away ergo here we go again 
true knocking the bradys is like dropkicking a wounded 
butterfly but tonights twohour premiere of their new friday 
series is so dim its not even suitable for goofing on but it does 
show the passage of time 
middleclass mom and pop florence henderson and robert reed of 
the original cast parents of six children now are grandparents 
their kids are all grown most are middleclass and all have 
problems of their own 
oh drat we gave away the plot 
however those who decide to practice tuba tonight instead of 
watching this show should know theyll miss its major crisis which 
occurs because bobby the youngest mike lookinland is a rookie 
racecar driver 
hes facing the big race the nashville 500 most of the family 
is watching in person or via tv his disc jockey sister susan 
olsen in nashville to broadcast the race for her station urges 
listeners to root along with me yayyyyyy bobby 
bobby gets in his stock car the starter says gentlemen start 
your engines then the track announcer says and theres the 
famous call for gentlemen start your engines all this means 
the race will begin 
a few laps then its uhoh time screeching tires crunching 
metal theres a pause in the action the track announcer says 
boy this is a fullcourse yellow a little brady asks is 
uncle bobby going to be okay 
later uncle bobby in his hospital bed also wonders he asks 
his anxious parents mom dad am i going to walk again 
only time and therapy will tell but at least it draws the 
family together to gently illustrate the problems of the disabled 
resolve lesser crises that have been brewing and provide a sure 
cure for insomnia 
there are many lesser crises to pick from the one that stands 
out seems to have become topic a in shows about thirtysomething 
married couples the desire of yuppie wives to have a baby before 
its too late 
here the wife is jan eve plumb an architect wed to phillip 
ron kuhlman a college professor every time she ovulates she 
summons him and they rush home and hop into bed but no baby 
not even a romantic sea voyage does the trick this lovemaking 
by the numbers gets kind of grim for him even though she smiles a 
lot he asks if there cannot be just a bit more romance she smiles 
and says this 
phillip we tried romantic even on the ship no baby nows 
the time for persistence remember the tick tick tick of that 
old biological clock 
the show might have been better had one of bobbys lines gone to 
jans sexwearied husband who could ask his parentsinlaw mom 
dad am i going to walk again 
but let us count our blessings even though were no good at 
fractions the bradys arent entirely whitebread now bobbys chief 
mechanic in tonights show is black one character who probably 
will marry into the family is jewish and a little korean girl 
joins the cast at the finale which also features a wedding because 
tv executives thinking weddings increase ratings this one includes 
singing by henderson 
on the bright side she doesnt sing feelings 
we know youll want to tune in for next weeks episode of the 
bradys in which the crisis is the citys plan to run a freeway 
right through ma and pa bradys posh suburban neighbhood you may 
root for the freeway

while the moneyed people from elsewhere 
crowd their beaches and resorts jamaicans are being told by the 
yearold government of prime minister michael manley to tighten 
their belts 
manley is imposing harsh austerity measures to satisfy western 
creditors and cope with jamaicas crippling 43 billion deficit 
the measures include a 195 perscent increase in the price of 
basic foodstuffs like flour and cornmeal an average 325 percent 
rise in electricity rates and a 50 percent surcharge on dozens of 
luxury items such as christmas tree lights and tv satellite dishes 
the government also devalued the jamaican dollar by 71 percent 
to 7 per us dollar from 650 to dampen demand for imports and 
ease a chronic shortage of foreign exchange 
it was the latest round in a series of price rises and monetary 
controls including higher interest rates imposed by manley since 
returning to power in a landslide election victory feb 9 1989 
his repeated manipulation of the economy which officials 
acknowledge has hurt the poor most has cut into his popularity 
a poll late last year by political analyst carl stone who has 
accurately predicted election outcomes since the 1970s indicated 
that 52 percent of jamaican voters were not satisfied with manleys 
peoples national party government 40 percent were satisfied and 
the remainder were undecided 
columnist byron buckley writing in the sunday gleaner an 
independent weekly accused the prime minister of failing to follow 
through on his partys election campaign slogan to put the people 
first 
never before in the nations history has a newly elected 
government proceeded so quickly to renege on the basic tenet of the 
election platform buckley wrote 
jamaican business and political leaders said however that in 
his first year manley has thoroughly lived up to his pledge to 
abandon the radical socialism of his previous two administrations 
in the 1970s in those years manley appropriated private farms 
heavily taxed business and forged close ties with cubas fidel 
castro antagonizing the united states and western investors and 
pushing jamaica to the edge of economic collapse 
many say the costcutting freeenterprise regimen of manleys 
new social democratic administration is barely distinguishable from 
that of his predecessor the conservative edward seaga of the 
jamaica labor party who during the eight years in office was 
regarded as former president ronald reagans closest ally in the 
caribbean 
it was amazing i never thought he could do it anthony 
barnes president of the influential jamaica manufacturers 
association said of manleys political conversion as a 
businessman i unhesitatingly say that i find the new manley a very 
refreshing individual 
indeed barnes said manleys government has been a lot more 
responsive and a lot more willing to listen to the productive 
sector 
i consider it to be a major and significant difference between 
the two leaders barnes said 
in foreign affairs manley has fostered good relations with the 
bush administration and assumed a high profile in the drug war 
winning united nations approval for a proposed global 
antinarcotics strike force 
barnes and others said the manley administration still appears 
to be feeling its way and has not yet demonstrated the decisiveness 
and managerial competence of the seaga team 
there is an image problem with this goverment that they may 
not have the discipline to handle the really difficult problems 
barnes said 
the opposition doesnt see it that way 
you get the impression that this government is in a quandary 
and doesnt know what its doing said bruce golding chairman of 
seagas jamaica labor party ineptitude is perhaps an appropriate 
team to use 
in a speech jan 28 preparing the nation for the 
belttightening manley said he was being forced to take the action 
under terms of a 15month agreement with the international monetary 
fund the agreement which went into effect jan 1 provides a 108 
million loan and was required for negotiations with commercial 
banks on rescheduling of 400 million of jamaicas foreign debt and 
for any new loans from the world bank and european and caribbean 
lending agencies 
the government contends it has been forced to make repeated 
economic adjustments because of pressure arising from jamaicas 
foreign debt which doubled during seagas years 
with 24 million people jamaica has one of the worlds largest 
per capita debts brought on mainly by soaring oil prices in the 
1970s and the nearcollapse of the jamaican bauxite industry in the 
1980s 
nearly 50 cents of every dollar coming into the treasury is used 
to pay interest on the debt in addition jamaica imports 100 
percent of its energy needs mostly oil which must be paid for in 
us dollars 
without the imf agreement manly said in his speech jamaica 
would be in serious trouble in four weeks or less he added that 
it was a matter of nothing less than selfpreservation 
the new austerity measures had long been expected and immediate 
criticism was subdued the government avoided any immediate rise in 
gasoline prices which was the trigger for widespread civil unrest 
in 1985 
to further soften the blow the government amended its 
wageprice guidelines to allow unions to negotiate for pay raises 
of 125 percent up from the previous 10 percent

congregations hold a potential ax over the careers of baptist 
pastors and many times swing it often its a shock to the victim 
he hadnt foreseen it but hes out by choice of his flock 
such terminations have become a painful problem in the big 
southern baptist convention hundreds of whose pastors are 
summarily fired each year by disgruntled congregations 
its personally and professionally shattering for the 
minister says the rev ernest o white director of the dehoney 
center for study of the local church its traumatic for him and 
his family 
its also detrimental to the church the name of christian 
faith is scarred by that kind of thing 
however unlike most major denominations baptists in their 
organizational system stress the autonomy of local congregations 
free to hire or fire their pastors at will without intervention 
our polity declares that the pastor must be reasonably 
pleasing to the congregation white said in an interview this 
places some limits on the pastor in confronting controversial 
subjects 
in roman catholic eastern orthodox and united methodist 
churches bishops designate pastors in the united church 
lutheran presbyterian and episcopal churches its a mutual 
procedure of congregations and overseeing entities 
but for baptists and various independentstyle churches its 
solely up to the local congregation to pick or oust a pastor and 
baptist studies have found that the toll of dismissals is immense 
a 1988 study found that more than 2100 pastors were fired 
during an 18month period that means 116 ministers were fired each 
month a 31 percent increase over the rate found in a 1984 study 
most every one of them is a tragedy in our view of the 
experience said white whose center recently did a special study 
of such firings in missouri 
its detrimental both to the church and the ministers 
the 148 millionmember denomination the countrys largest 
protestant body has about 37000 local congregations 
white said the centers missouri study found that about half the 
ousted pastors eventually find other pulpits but the other half 
are lost to the ministry and go into other kinds of work 
after theyve had their dream of being a minister after four 
years of college and three years of seminary they get busted he 
said its also after an average five years in the ministry the 
study found 
white who teaches preaching at the southern baptist theological 
seminary in louisville ky where the study center is situated 
said the blame can lie with either side 
however he said many congregations have a kind of conflict 
mentality that repeat these firings they often are engineered 
by factions and power groups that want to control the church more 
than by leadership of the pastor 
some other congregations have a winning coach view that 
causes the trouble he said if the church isnt growing 
numerically or winning then get rid of the leader and get another 
one 
they see expansionism as the only criteria of validity even 
in areas not conducive to expansion he said and put all the 
responsibility for it on the pastor rather than seeing the 
congregations part in the task 
the study found that most ousted pastors have full seminary 
training and in their seminary idealism couldnt conceive the 
possibility that life in the parish would be rough and tumble 
white said but politics in the churches is not too different 
from politics in the courthouse 
pastors also can sometimes be at fault in being either too 
authoritarian or too selfeffacing and paralyzed in their 
leadership he said these are ditches on either side of the 
road 
also most ousted pastors apparently not adequately sensitive 
to member attitudes werent even aware of a problem in advance he 
said the first time they knew they had a problem is when they 
were asked to resign 
white 60 a pastor himself for 32 years said the relationship 
between a pastor and congregation is somewhat like a marriage and 
the partners need to get better acquainted before sealing their 
pact 
to try to ease the problem state directors of missions are now 
sometimes invited by congregations to intervene in difficulties 
about the pastor and seek a solution he said 
this is one of the hopeful signs white said 
he himself often serves as a consultantadviser in such 
situations but such interventions can only be at invitation of 
congregations and that usually comes when the situation has 
deteriorated too far to repair 
such intervention by regional ministers to forestall and mediate 
such conflicts has become customary procedure in another 
denomination whose policy provides congregational autonomy the 
christian church disciples of christ

several roman catholic scholars have 
criticized a vaticanissued draft of a proposed universal catechism 
that has been distributed to bishops for their reactions 
following a symposium the scholars said at a news conference 
that there were serious deficiencies in the document particuarly 
in failing to make distinctions between essential truths of faith 
and peripheral elements 
the 430page document is intended as a comprehensive summary of 
catholic beliefs 
lawrence cunningham a theology professor at the university of 
notre dame said one of the documents most glaring weaknesses 
is that it suffers from what computer people would call an 
information overload lacking guidance on whats more 
important and whats less important 
bishops are supposed to submit responses by may 31 bishop 
rayumond f lucker of new ulm minn who participated in the 
symposium said im hoping there will be substantial changes

beyond disagreements over slavery it was a vicious campaign 
with lincoln subjected to endless personal attacks from southern 
newspapers 
he has most unwarrantly abused the privilege which all 
politicians have of being ugly the houston chronicle sneered 
commenting on lincolns thin pockmarked face and unruly hair a 
horrid looking wretch he is added the charleston sc mercury 
sooty and scoundrelly in aspect a cross between the nutmeg 
dealer the horse dealer and the night man 
but lincoln who would soon follow the advice of little grace 
bedell of westfield ny and grow a beard said nothing making 
no formal speeches during the campaign and thanks to the 
democratic split he easily won the election while receiving only 
40 percent of the votes 
by his inauguration in march 1861 however seven southern 
states had already seceded and rumors of an assassination attempt 
had forced him to alter travel plans the previous month in his 
inaugural address lincoln pleaded for a peaceful settlement to the 
slavery issue 
we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it 
must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory 
stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every 
living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet 
swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they 
will be by the better angels of our nature 
on april 12 the confederates opened fire on fort sumter in 
charleston harbor and captured it two days later lincoln vowing 
to repel force by force called for a militia of 75000 and 
ordered a blockade of southern ports the civil war had begun 
except in respect to military matters lincoln was not the 
kind of president we expect today fehrenbacher said he didnt 
give leadership in domestic affairs because he didnt think that 
was his job the whigs had been opposing the dictatorship of 
president andrew jackson they believed that was the leadership 
of congress he took the leadership role in war and also in 
regards to emancipation 
with typical caution lincoln dismantled slavery in 1862 he 
drafted the emancipation proclamation but waited for a union 
victory before officially issuing it on jan 1 1863 
what good would a proclamation for emancipation from me do 
especially as we are now situated he worried i do not want to 
issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be 
inoperative like the popes bull against the comet would my word 
free the slaves when i cannot even enforce the constitution in the 
rebel states 
the turning point in the civil war came that summer outside 
gettysburg pa for three days one of the wars bloodiest battles 
was fought nearly 50000 soldiers were killed and the confederate 
army of northern virginia was forced to retreat 
in november lincoln was a lastminute invitee to the dedication 
of the civil war cemetery in gettysburg the gettysburg address 
under 300 words long was a modest prayer that despite the war 
government of the people by the people and for the people shall 
not perish from the earth 
ironically lincoln predicted in the same speech the world 
will little note nor long remember what we say here 
its quite obvious that he realized this was an occasion that 
something important could be said about the meaning of war and the 
meaning of america fehrenbacher said he saw it a new birth of 
freedom and its obvious he gave a great deal of thought to what 
he was saying 
the republican party overwhelmingly chose lincoln as its 
candidate in the 1864 elections the democrats selected gen george 
b mcclellan whom lincoln had dropped as commanderinchief of 
union forces in 1862 
with the union deadlocked on the battlefield lincoln seemed 
sure he would lose even writing a memorandum of the probable 
failure of reelection on aug 23 but he easily won in november 
with malice towards none with charity for all with firmness 
in the right let us strive to finish the work we are in 
lincoln urged at his inaugural in march 1865 hoping for a peaceful 
way to bind up the nations wounds 
once victory seemed assured lincolns thoughts moved beyond 
winning the war and focused instead on reconstruction the subject 
of his last speech given on april 11 two days after gen robert 
e lees surrender at appomattox 
on april 14 while attending a play at the ford theatre in 
washington lincoln was shot in the head by actor john wilkes 
booth who cried out sic semper tyranus thus ever to 
tyrants the motto of virginia he died the following morning 
lincoln had long worried about death thinking speaking and 
even dreaming of his assassination in his early 50s he was 
already referring to himself as an old man and he reflected on 
mortality in an 1862 letter to young fanny mccullough whose father 
was killed in battle 
in this sad world of ours sorrow comes to all and to the 
young it comes with bitterest agony because it takes them 
unawares the older have learned to ever expect it i am anxious to 
afford some alleviation of your present distress perfect relief is 
not possible except with time 
the mrobably would have continued as a writer 
fehrenbacher said 
in the presidency he was increasingly concerned with the art 
of writing that shows in his best works and thats one more thing 
that john wilkes booth took away from us

his voice was unforgettable his songs took us 
down memory lane route 66 to be exact to those lazy hazy crazy 
days of summer and if you were lucky his ballads recalled the 
very thought of you 
nat king cole was loved for sentimental reasons during 
world war ii his love songs offered a warm balm for soldiers away 
from home allowing them to make believe they were home with their 
sweethearts 
the national academy of recording arts and sciences will honor 
cole with a lifetime achievement award during its grammy 
presentation on feb 21 six days after the 25th anniversary of his 
death at age 45 from lung cancer 
during his 23 years with capitol records until 1964 cole 
recorded hundreds of songs and many went on to become industry 
standards unforgettable the christmas song route 66 
and ramblin rose 
coles voice was a lovely work of art a beguiling mona lisa of 
sound described as everything from three parts fog to one part 
frog a pussy willow and a breathy swatch of velvet 
lore has it that he began his career as a crooner by accident a 
tipsy customer at a small hollywood bistro where he was playing 
piano insisted he sing sweet lorraine and to keep the drunk 
quiet cole obliged 
once he began singing however he quickly became a fluent 
vocalist changing styles and rhythms with ease weaving together 
sets that easily combined swinging bebop hits and honeycoated love 
songs 
his wife maria cole said it was his voice that truly launched 
him 
he never would have been the international figure he became if 
he hadnt been singing she said in an interview i know in my 
heart he wanted it he liked the attention 
born in 1919 to a baptist minister in montgomery ala 
nathaniel adams coles grew up in chicagos south side he later 
dropped the s from his last name and added his nickname king 
at the age of 4 he was able to pluck out the tune yes we 
have no bananas on the piano and later played the organ in his 
fathers church when he was 14 he organized a 14piece band and 
made himself piano player and leader 
i was always crazy about show business cole once said 
and i was particularly crazy about bands why i used to stand in 
front of the radio and lead bands all the time 
after high school he worked with several bands without great 
success until 1937 when he got hip took a timely trip and motored 
west 
it was in california that he formed the king cole trio a 
piano a guitar and bass playing gigs for 75 a week with cole 
on the piano oscar moore on guitar and johnny miller on bass the 
trio generated a following and began to tour 
in new york in 1946 already married to nadine robinson cole 
met the then maria ellington a striking beauty who was rehearsing 
for a show at the chic club zanzibar 
its terrible i feel funny when i tell this story because im 
usually so doggone dignified but he did say it he said boy if 
she looks as good from the front as she does from the back the 
second mrs cole recalled breaking off in a peal of laughter 
and then of course i ignored him he didnt interest me 
cole persevered sending her tickets a boxing match which he 
couldnt attend because of a gig but a few weeks later he took her 
to a horse race and the romance got past the starting gate he 
divorced his first wife and he and maria were married a year 
later during their 15year marriage they had five children 
carol natalie kelly and identical twins timolin and casey 
cole an ardent babeball fan named his last child for the late 
manager casey stengel 
he was basically introverted mrs cole said except for 
when he talked about music and baseball but those things he knew 
and he knew he knew them there was no holding back when it came to 
either one 
that was wonderful that i loved sports because i would have 
been home a lot by myself 
natalie a grammy winner remembers her fathers passion for 
racing around in his sports car 
he liked to go for drives she said in an interview he 
had a sports car a jaguar and i think i was the only one that 
would get in with him he was a fast driver 
as far as musical influences natalie recalled her father 
singing childrens songs he didnt go around the house singing 
mona lisa she said they were childrens songs fun songs 
and those are the songs that i remember and those are the songs 
that ive passed on to my son 
she then launched into one oh mary mac mac mac all 
dressed in black black black with silver buttons all down her 
back back back 
not all of her associations with her father however are as 
warm 
for me i didnt really feel like i was in his shadow until i 
chose singing as my career and then all of the sudden it loomed 
up as something pretty intimidating and overwhelming 
natalie wanted to be recognized for her own talent and not just 
for being the namesake of nat king cole 
for a long time i really wished i could change my name she 
said its been since about six years ago that i really have been 
able to carry it gracefully and hopefully in a way that is proud 
and becoming to his flesh and blood 
in 1956 cole started his own network television show the nat 
king cole show on nbc but national advertisers were leary about 
backing a show hosted by a black man the first of its kind and 
the program was eventually forced off the air 
madison avenue is afraid of the dark cole concluded 
cole also appeared as the blues composer wc handy in the movie 
st louis blues and had a role in the jane fonda film cat 
ballou 
he was full of humor mrs cole said many people dont 
know this he was very funny hed make dry wonderful remarks 
he was a fun man to be with i had a wonderful life i miss 
him more now that im older so im just very happy that hes 
getting his due 
her favorite nat king cole song our love is here to 
stay

rap musics come a long way from the days of parties in the 
south bronx when disc jockeys manipulated records in a frantic 
competition to see who could keep people on the dance floor te 
longest 
now it seems rap is everywhere and is firmly established as a 
music category at the annual grammy awards which will be held feb 
21 
that makes grandmaster flash proud even though this pioneer 
barely has time to pause from his producing chores to reflect on 
raps rapid rise 
im a little shocked but then again im happy because i knew 
it was an appealing form of music said flash one of a handful 
of deejays credited with creating rap in the mid1970s but to 
what magnitude it would reach was a mystery to me 
rappers sell millions of records but their names and music are 
as bewildering to a generation of americans over age 21 as john 
paul george and ringo were more than 25 years ago 
its a veritable alphabet soup of stars theres ll cool j and 
kool moe dee theres nwa heavy d icet and rundmc theres 
young mc and mc lyte dj jazzy jeff and dnice theres salt n 
pepa flavor flav and the fat boys 
the groove is good you can dance to it said ll cool j 
updating the line teenagers have used to praise records on 
american bandstand since before he was born 
like bob dylan in the 1960s raps opened the door to many 
artists who arent conventional singers but have something to say 
because of rap the beat has overshadowed the melody as the primary 
element in many pop songs to the chagrin of many rap popularized 
the technique of sampling old sounds in new music 
rap also has emphasized differences political racial musical 
and generational still alive in music and society as a whole 
flash the moniker of joseph saddler spun disco records at 
clubs and parties in the south bronx he and fellow deejays used 
turntables and records the way other musicians used guitars and 
keyboards eventually some dejays started rapping or talking 
through microphones over the music 
hiphop and breakdancing became hot styles rap records 
many released on independent labels became hits through word of 
mouth and play in dance clubs the message a 1982 
stateoftheghetto report by flash and his band the furious five 
was an early landmark 
rap technicians quickly learned to mine old records for new 
sounds now its a popular practice janet jacksons hit rhythm 
nation uses a passage directly lifted from an old sly and the 
family stone record jailed soul star james brown has reached a 
whole new generation of listeners because of old passages 
sampled in new rap songs says ll cool j 
some artists are flattered by the new attention others so angry 
they launch lawsuits 
many pop music fans say rap has claimed the mantle of innovation 
that rock music earned in the 1960s 
it can actually stand on its own legs now where at one point 
it was understood to be a fad flash said it was just 
considered in its own little category from a technical and 
creative point of view i always knew that this could intertwine 
with various forms of music your jazz blues rock and pop 
another fan is 38yearold william adler hes admittedly a 
little biased since his job at rush artists management involves 
steering the careers of rap artists such as public enemy and ll 
cool j 
to me its the most thrilling rock n roll being made 
today adler said do i want a big beat its there do i want 
rebellion its there do i want wit do i want sex do i want 
social engagement do i want nonsense all there and it delivers 
it to me in greater measure than any other comparable musical form 
right now 
rap styles are as diverse as music itself 
dj jazzy jeff and the fresh prince are goodnatured pop stars 
with such novelty songs as i think i can beat mike tyson and 
the teen anthem parents just dont understand the aptly named 
fat boys have made duets with the beach boys and chubby checker 
artists such as nwa and public enemy are on the other end of the 
spectrum with blunt lyrics that pick up where the message left 
off a controversial nwa song about black attitudes toward police 
left law enforcement on edge public enemy with its recent single 
welcome to the terrordome has opened a jewishblack rift 
many rappers are simply braggarts claiming to be the biggest 
the baddest the best that in turn has brought complaints of 
sexism and the calculatedly contrary stance of artists such as the 
female salt n pepa and the 1960sinfluenced de la soul 
rap and rock have also forged an interesting alliance they were 
thought to be contrary camps until rundmcs hugely influential 
remake of aerosmiths walk this way broke down barriers in 1987 
high ratings for mtvs yo mtv raps show also indicate that 
rap is not just music for black teenagers 
black america is not hooked up for cable im sorry adler 
said its a suburban phenomenon so you know who the audience is 
for yo mtv raps 
the grammys created a new category last year to honor rap music 
but several of its stars boycotted the awards because the rap 
grammy wasnt presented on primetime television 
also although tone locs sly homage to sex wild thing 
last year became the biggestselling single since we are the 
world it never made it to no 1 on the billboard singles charts 
because some top 40 radio stations wont play rap no rap single 
has ever reached no 1 on the billboard pop charts 
some rappers say racism has a lot to do with that but that 
doesnt explain the socalled black radio stations that also 
resist rap in favor of the soul sounds of the 60s and 70s 
occasional violence at rap concerts has given communities 
jitters and caused some cancellations rappers say its not the 
music that causes trouble but some fans who are gang members 
some rappers are worried about too much rap not too little 
they wonder if rap will go the way of disco and collapse under the 
weight of too many mediocre records russell simmons founder of 
def jam records complains that major record labels are signing too 
many bad rap acts in their attempt to find new stars 
but radio resistance hasnt stopped rap from seeping into 
mainstream culture advertisers looking for a youthful market know 
rap sells rap was incorporated into the work of several top 40 
musicians through the 1980s from blondies rapture in 1980 to 
billy joels we didnt start the fire in 1989 
theres nothing wrong with that ll cool j said of the 
competition with joel suburban long islands favorite white son 
i like it that just shows that people are opening up if an 
artist like billy joel does something like that maybe people will 
listen to a little guy like ll cool j

now that theyve won their freedom what does 
the future hold for the people of eastern europe hard times are 
ahead it seems to make economic reforms work in the new 
democracies will require a lot of personal sacrifice and extensive 
aid from the west 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in eastern europe ideology has 
once again come facetoface with hard reality making a revolution 
is often easier than fulfilling its goals 
after overthrowing four decades of rigid communist rule the 
people of eastern europe are facing enormous problems 
the years of centrally planned systems and communist 
mismanagement have left east european economies in such ruins that 
a lot of help from the west and plenty of sacrifices of their own 
will be necessary before the countries can stand on their own feet 
while the problems are gigantic and many people are pessimistic 
the prodemocracy drive received a tremendous boost when the soviet 
communists on wednesday approved president mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposal that the party give up its monopoly on power 
the decision closed the circle that began with gorbachevs 
policies of glasnost and perestroika that allowed east european 
countries to go their own way 
but it will take years before the economies of east european 
countries are sound and competitive during the adjustment to a 
freemarket system the governments will have to deal with 
unemployment bankruptcies inflation and massive debts even an 
atrophied work ethic 
experts say the environmental woes of several east european 
countries are bordering on catastrophe and will take years and 
billions of dollars to clean up 
an accelerating exodus of skilled workers averaging about 1800 
a day strikes and absenteeism are driving east germany to the 
brink of economic collapse 
more than 400000 east germans have resettled in west germany in 
a year west germany struggling to cope with the rate of new 
arrivals has been forced to step in to try to bail out the 
faltering neighbor with infusion of aid and plans for a quick 
monetary union unification may come faster than anyone anticipated 
poland owes 40 billion to western creditors hungary and 
yugoslavia about 20 billion each yugoslavias inflation rate is 
more than 1500 percent annually 
solidarity leader lech walesa acknowledges the shocktherapy 
plan to tame the inflation and transform poland into a freemarket 
economy is painful and says it needs a lot of western aid 
we are like a car with four wheels running in different 
directions moving fast but slipping backward nothing can be done 
from inside the car walesa told a reporter in gdansk recently 
he said foreign aid already promised is insufficient 
it is too slow and too little he said this is why i see 
this reform plan as blacker and blacker we cannot reform our old 
system within our own means this is impossible without outside 
help 
poland was the forerunner in the democratic transformation when 
it became the first east european country to get a noncommunist 
government in 1990 many eyes will be on poland again to see the 
progress of its economic recovery 
the plan which went into effect on jan 1 decontrolled prices 
foreign exchange and centrally allocated industrial inputs it is 
based on a restrictive budget policy designed to bring down 
inflation within six months and is coupled with tight wage policy 
it is the most radical daring economic reform program ever 
attempted in eastern europe 
the course of our reforms is giving stimulation to the changes 
in other countries of the region the failure of the efforts could 
make more difficult the evolution occurring in central and eastern 
europe polish premier tadeusz mazowiecki told parliament on jan 
18 
yugoslavias similar plan includes a sixmonth wage freeze 
strict monetary controls closing down of unprofitable companies 
and liberalized imports to provide more competition to domestic 
industries the dinar was made convertible at a fixed rate to the 
west german mark 
both poland and yugoslavia were advised on their programs by 
jeffrey sachs a professor of economics at harvard 
although the wage freeze already has triggered a fresh wave of 
strikes in yugoslavia sachs predicts they will gradually cease as 
cheaper imports bring down domestic prices 
the political focus will be on free elections that are scheduled 
throughout the region this year 
also poland and czechoslovakia have asked the soviets to 
withdraw their troops from the two countries and budapest has 
requested an accelerated pace of the pullout from hungary 
free parliamentary elections are scheduled in east germany 
hungary romania and czechoslovakia and local elections in poland 
are expected to be moved up to april 
in the soviet union all 15 republics will hold local elections 
that will offer a choice of candidates for the first time bulgaria 
is also expected to hold free elections although the date has not 
been fixed 
in nonaligned yugoslavia the communists are expected to 
compete with other groups in parliamentary elections that could 
take place as early as april 
although it broke away from the soviet bloc in 1948 and for 
years followed its own model of more liberal communism yugoslavia 
has fallen behind in the pace of political reforms going on in 
other east european countries 
like the soviet union yugoslavia is a country of a delicate 
ethnic balance and different republics where nationalist feelings 
could jeopardize the transition to democracy 
the baltic states in the soviet union are pushing for 
independence strong nationalist movements have emerged in georgia 
and moldavia which borders romania the communist party of 
lithuania has broken with moscow

moscow sent thousands of soldiers to halt the civil war between 
christian armenians and moslem azerbaijanis and quell an uprising 
in azerbaijan 
the westernmost yugoslav republic of slovenia is also toying 
with secession and its communists have broken away from the 
national party organization after a deep split between reformers 
and hardliners 
a 10year drive for more autonomy by the ethnic albanians most 
of them moslems in the southern province of kosovo exploded in 
another round of violence at the end of january that killed nearly 
30 people 
neighboring albania remains the last bastion of stalinism in 
eastern europe but is showing cautious signs of emerging from its 
selfimposed isolation reports in yugoslav and greek newspapers of 
recent disturbances in albania have been strongly denied by tirana 
thousands of bulgarians have demonstrated against restoring the 
rights of moslem ethnic turks 
such outbreaks of dangerous nationalism and ethnic fighting are 
reviving fears of instability that once made the balkans the powder 
keg of europe they could sap the energies needed for an orderly 
transition to democracy and take precious time away from pressing 
economic problems 
the communists have lost their constitutionally guaranteed 
monopoly on power in east european countries but they still have 
powerful assets that give them an organizational advantage over the 
opposition in the campaigns leading to the elections 
while getting rid of the old stalinist leaders the communists 
have reorganized themselves changing their names in some cases 
and are not going to give up without a fight at the ballot box 
in east germany the communists tried to seize on the alleged 
rise of rightwing extremists to drum up support but the party is 
losing members and is unlikely to get a significant number of votes 
in the march 18 elections 
the disorganized fractured and inexperienced opposition has 
realized the problem and different groups are forging alliances as 
the country stumbles toward the elections 
ulrich stockman a leader of the social democratic party says 
it is hard to organize people politically after 40 years of apathy 
under communist rule 
people have felt lost with all these new parties coming up 
all the time after decades of political unawareness stockman 
said 
but the east german parties are receiving extensive 
organizational and campaign aid from their west german counterparts 
and a poll in early february predicted the social democrats would 
win 54 percent of the vote with the communists a distant second at 
12 percent 
krisztina bokor a 50yearold budapest manager recently 
expressed some of the pessimism building up in the wake of 
revolutionary euphoria in hungary 
the elections will be characterized by apathy she said 
most people are apolitical because there is no real motivation to 
get them to become involved 
the country has no political culture i do not expect any 
positive changes to come about in my lifetime not in that of the 
next generation mrs bokor said 
mrs edit somlai a 29yearold budapest teacher said the 
country was moving toward democracy but unfortunately it wont 
bring a better economic situation in our lifetime 
unlike poland or czechoslovakia east germanys prodemocracy 
movement lacks charismatic leaders that could unite the mushrooming 
groups in hungary opposition groups also are bickering weakening 
their election prospects 
but a democratically elected government in east germany can 
count on west german aid to prop us its economy 
for all the problems facing eastern europe they pale in 
comparison with those confronting gorbachev 
perestroika and glasnost have been a huge success for 
gorbachevs image abroad but at home the stores are empty 
food rationing continues in most parts of the vast country with 
monthly ceilings on the amounts of tea meat sugar matches and 
other staples that soviets can buy 
party conservatives fought gorbachevs proposal for abandoning 
the communists constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power and 
opening the way for a multiparty system 
the provision already had been struck from the constitution in 
lithuania in favor of a multiparty system and latvias legislature 
has moved to do the same 
gorbachev wants to advance the 28th national party congress from 
october to june or early july and the communists future role is 
likely to be its major topics 
in the local elections voters will be able to choose between 
several candidates voters in many areas are expected to reject 
communist candidates in favor of nationalists populists and 
maverick communists not backed by the local party potentates

the fliers with jacobs smiling face 
are yellowing the ribbons bearing his name are tattered the tips 
to investigators are dwindling time fades almost everything 
except hope 
hope is what guides and drives patty and jerry wetterling from 
what they do and say to how they think and pray for almost four 
months theyve prayed that their abducted son jacob will return 
home 
theirs is a story with a beginning and a middle but no end 
every day youre suspended mrs wetterling says theres 
no meaning to days and nights and weeks some people call and say 
its been seven weeks its been eight weeks after five minutes 
it was too long its painful to me every morning when i wake 
up and hes not here its wrong 
a masked gunman grabbed jacob wetterling 11 as he his brother 
and a buddy rode back from a convenience store the abductor 
ordered the two other boys to run or hed shoot then disappeared 
into the darkness with jacob less than a halfmile from the 
familys home 
no night will ever seem longer no feeling more helpless a 
missing child a stunned family then days of helicopters dogs and 
the national guard scouring the fields patty and jerry were afraid 
theyd find something and afraid theyd find nothing 
fears have since turned to frustration jacobs name is no 
longer a staple of the local news the familys 24hour police 
guard left weeks ago the 70member investigative team has shrunk 
to about a dozen 
wetterling 41 a chiropractor is back at work the three 
children are back in school but skating fishing and football 
outings have been replaced by efforts to keep the story alive 
fundraisers and plans to mark jacobs 12th birthday feb 17 
were not ready to pull together as a family of five and go 
on says mrs wetterling 40 thats not right yet for us 
she pauses then adds i dont ever want that to happen 
for the wetterlings its not if jacob will return but when 
hope is their theme tens of thousands of jacobs hope hats 
white ribbons signs buttons and tshirts have been distributed 
nationwide the words adorn a candle atop city hall and a sign in 
front of the family home in this quiet central minnesota town of 
3200 
we choose to remain hopeful because we believe were going to 
get jacob back mrs wetterling says kids do come home after a 
very long time 
of nearly 24000 missing children reported to the national 
center for missing and exploited children in a 5year period 
ending in december abductions by strangers accounted for less than 
4 percent most other disappearances involved family members or 
were runaways 
despite the public sense these cases are doom and gloom 
about 60 percent of children in longterm stranger abductions are 
found alive said ernie allen the centers president 
one of the most publicized steven stayner disappeared in 
california at age 7 in 1972 and surfaced in 1980 at a police 
station about 200 miles away with a 5yearold boy his abductor had 
snatched stayner was killed in a motorcyclecar accident last year 
but others remain haunting mysteries johnny gosch the 
12yearold iowa paperboy gone since 1982 etan patz the 
6yearold new yorker last seen walking to a school bus stop almost 
11 years ago 
investigators in the wetterling case have logged about 20000 
calls tips and potential suspects since the oct 22 abduction 
theyve released sketches of a 40to 50yearold man who last year 
kidnapped sexually assaulted then released a boy 10 miles away 
and another of a man with a menacing stare spotted in the store the 
same day jacob was there 
investigators believe theres a good possibility theyre the 
same man and consider him one of their stronger suspects 
corporations famous athletes and hundreds of everyday people 
also have joined the search a local pharmacist called dozens of 
folks in different area codes with the wetterlings phone number in 
case jacob got free and didnt know about long distance or wasnt 
sure where he was 
a volunteer office including people who dont even know the 
family directs the publicity effort i came just because im a 
mom says worker pat feldhege its pretty hard to resist 
jacobs smile 
more than 50 million fliers most sent by a directmail 
marketing company that regularly features missing children have 
been distributed and posted in train stations truck stops 
airports and malls its a cruel reality for a woman who couldnt 
bear to see missing kids on milk cartons 
i dont want him to be a poster child mrs wetterling says 
weve become symbolic and i dont want to appear ungrateful or 
angry but im not satisfied with that im just a mom who 
wants her kid 
jacobs parents travel the country making tv and radio 
appearances patiently and articulately answering questions baring 
their souls to america in hopes of finding their boy 
sometimes they meet parents of other abducted children its no 
solace to mrs wetterling 
i think it shouldnt happen to anybody much less a group of 
people and i especially dont want to be around a group of people 
whove been doing this for years she says its not comforting 
to know somebody else is going through hell 
the wetterling house is filled with signs of jacob a 
sixthgrader with a budding interest in the trombone a passion for 
sports and his family says a keen sense of fairness 
his orange parka hangs in his closet his handdrawn picture of 
a teenage mutant ninja turtle and posters of the detroit pistons 
isiah thomas and the chicago bears neal anderson line his walls 
his dog named after football player marcus allen pads around 
waiting for his pal 
as weeks turn to months the house has been decorated with 
balloons inspirational poems letters and cards from strangers 
paper birds from schoolchildren a handscrawled message we wont 
give up and a note from his 8yearold sister carmen we are 
so sorry evrybuty cryd very hard i love you 
carmen was really upset that santa claus didnt bring jacob 
any toys mrs wetterling says i told her he didnt bring them 
here maybe he found jacob or maybe hes waiting until we find 
jacob

trevor 10 who was with jacob that night thinks of his 
brother too when he recently got a baseball players autograph 
he collected an extra one he often sleeps in his parents room and 
didnt want to return to school 
i said theres a law that says kids have to go to school and 
he said even when your brothers missing his mother recalls 
i didnt know what to say to that 
the wetterlings say attending trevors hockey games is a sad 
reminder of jacobs love of the sport and skill as a goalie 
but some tasks are grimmer jerry had to check to see if jacob 
was in pornographic pictures police recovered in an impounded car 
in minneapolis 
both wetterlings are involved in the community patty once was 
pta president jerry led the chamber of commerce and a local naacp 
chapter now finding jacob is their work 
at one point i started getting more numb mrs wetterling 
says i actually felt kind of good because maybe hes gotten 
to feel more numb and then he wouldnt feel so lost or alone or 
afraid or pained 
whatevers going on hes just not feeling much of it her 
husband says i feel thats what hes had to do to survive 
the wetterlings say they dont think of the what ifs 
im not unrealistic but i cant function if i think about all 
the bad stuff jacobs mother says if i get down lots of 
times ill go find a group of kids because kids symbolize hope 
dan carle a friend who counsels the wetterlings says the 
family displays no vindictiveness they seem to have a quality of 
being able to forgive to hope he says theres a spiritual 
dimension to this family deeper than i understand 
jerry is an idealist patty an optimist that hasnt changed 
i have always been the type of person that if theres a 5 
percent chance of doing something i want to be in that 5 
percent she says if theres one chance in a million that 
jacob can still come home i want jacob to be the one

frustrated yes that we havent found her misheloff said 
very scared what she has gone through and what she is undergoing 
angry no i dont know who to be angry at i cant get angry at 
the world i cant be cynical at the world because of the actions 
of one crazy person or maybe a few crazy people 
though the family is coping as best as possible misheloff 
said ilenes twin didnt want to celebrate his 14th birthday and he 
and his wife cant bear to visit the ice rink where their daughter 
practiced competitive skating 
when a tv program showed a tape of her skating he said i 
could hardly keep control of myself 
misheloff a microchip engineer says he has put his career on 
hold because ilene is our no 1 priority the couple wont go 
anywhere they cant be reached by phone or leave town for a 
vacation

noreen gosch last saw her son johnny as a frecklefaced boy of 
12 heading off on his paper route if hes still alive hes a man 
i have a real difficult time even comprehending what this boy 
of 20 might be like she said to me hes still 12 all those 
years have been robbed from us the clock stopped 
since johnny disappeared from west des moines iowa on sept 5 
1982 his family has raised tens of thousands of dollars to hire 
investigators made hundreds of speeches and pushed for laws to 
require immediate police searches when children are reported 
missing 
theyve been victimized too one man tried to swindle them and 
phone solicitors falsely claimed they were collecting money on 
johnnys behalf 
mrs gosch said it took almost five years before family life got 
back to normal her heart and stomach pains have subsided but her 
memories of johnny havent dimmed 
you might hear a song on the radio that might be your childs 
favorite or pick up something your child gave you or you gave 
them she said the minute you see it touch it feel it or 
hear it it just floods back like the child is here 
when she recently posed for a photograph for a story on johnny 
she was asked to hold one of his belongings the minute i touched 
his jacket i could picture the night we bought it at the store i 
could hear him say oh mom i really love it it was like 
reliving the experience 
the gosches who have two other grown children remain hopeful 
we know that some day this case is going to be solved she 
said i want to know if hes alive of course if his life has 
been taken we can deal with it but we want to know i really 
thought we would have some answer by now

lattie mcgee was only 4 but he knew as much 
about torture as any concentration camp inmate or prisoner of war 
his prison was a dark closet in his familys south side apartment 
where he often was hung upside down bound and gagged for hours 
lattie liked to play with his toy cars dance silly with his 
brother watch cartoons and romp in the mud outside when the 
weather was warm 
but latties joyous childhood vanished the summer of 1987 a 
summer of torture testimony about the agonies he endured shocked 
prosecutors defense attorneys and even the judge 
latties mother and her livein boyfriend who said he beat 
lattie and his brother because he thought they were homosexual are 
to be sentenced thursday by cook county criminal court judge 
michael b getty 
getty called latties death the most heinous brutally 
sadistic torture and murder that i have ever heard in my 6 
years as a judge my over 10 years as a prosecutor or indeed my 51 
years on this earth 
lattie was starved burned with a hot iron stuck with pins and 
needles singed with cigarettes beaten with a tree branch hair 
brush belt and hands scalded with steaming water and tied up 
with a clothesline rope and tights for 2 months that summer 
court testimony showed 
a severe blow to his head in august was the eventual cause of 
death but his emaciated body scarred from head to foot was so 
infected from untreated wounds that he likely would have died a 
short time later a pathologist from the county medical examiners 
office testified 
latties torture death and the criminal convictions are more an 
exception than the rule said dr demetra soter coordinator of the 
pediatric trauma unit at cook county hospital 
abuse cases often are not prosecuted until the victim is killed 
because people in high levels of position cant believe that 
people torture children she said hopefully with people 
seeing stuff like this theyll start to believe that it really 
happens 
latties was one of 40278 reported cases of child abuse or 
neglect in cook county in 1987 and one of 38 reported deaths said 
david schneidman a spokesman for the state department of children 
and family services statewide there were 91723 cases and 54 
deaths he said 
the numbers are worse for 1988 the most recent period for which 
statistics are available in cook county 54 of the 42564 reported 
abuse or neglect cases ended in death schneidman said statewide 
91723 cases of abuse or neglect and 98 deaths were reported 
the night before lattie died his mothers boyfriend johnny 
campbell taped potato peels over the boys eyes and hung him in 
the closet court records show 
when lattie was taken down the next day aug 14 1987 and 
asked for water campbell told him to act like a man and get it 
himself lattie tried but sapped of strength failed campbell 
punched him in the head the records show 
when lattie didnt move his mother called an ambulance he was 
pronounced dead on arrival at south shore hospital lattie weighed 
26 pounds the size of a normal 1yearold 
dr shaku teas the pathologist who did the autopsy was asked 
by a prosecutor if she found anything remarkable about his injuries 
everything was remarkable she said describing his injuries 
in gruesome detail as photographs of his body were shown in court 
his pelvis had been broken several days before he died and two 
of his ribs had been snapped several weeks earlier ms teas 
testified 
campbell 40 pleaded guilty dec 6 to murdering lattie and 
beating the boys brother cornelius abraham now 8 his attorney 
says campbell is psychotic 
on jan 11 getty convicted the childrens 28yearold mother 
alicia abraham on the same charges she acknowledged never 
reporting the torture of her children but said she did not abuse 
them herself 
prosecutors have urged getty to order the pair executed for what 
assistant states attorney james bigoness called a truly 
abominable crime 
its probably one of the ugliest cases you will ever see 
said clyde lemons jr ms abrahams attorney who argued that she 
was guilty of bad judgment but was not a murderer 
lavonne steger 18 whose parents cared for ms abraham as a 
child when her own parents died still cries when talking about 
lattie she considers ms abraham her sister and often played with 
the children when they were brought over for a visit 
cornelius liked to play basketball and read lattie was a quiet 
boy with shining dark eyes and a sweet smile 
he liked to go outside and play in the mud miss steger said 
in a telephone interview her voice at times choking with emotion 
other days he just liked to watch cartoons and play with his 
cars he was happy 
lattie was the second child born to ms abraham a small stocky 
woman she dropped out of south shore high school when she became 
pregnant with cornelius and had lattie two years later she never 
married the boys father lattie mcgee sr an attendant at the 
countys home for juvenile delinquents the two were together five 
years until splitting up in 1984 and she had two more children 
with another man 
mcgee who now has cornelius could not be reached to talk about 
the case calls to his home went unanswered or were disconnected 
when a reporter called 
unemployed and on public aid ms abraham was accused of neglect 
in 1985 after state authorities found her living in a filthy 
apartment with no furniture her sons slept on the floor and were 
inadequately fed court records show 
ms abraham underwent counseling after months of supervision 
state investigators determined the situation had improved 
but then she met johnny campbell a short fineboned man with 
powerfully muscled arms who said he was a vietnam veteran and 
exsteel worker whod been fired for alcohol and drug abuse 
in early 1987 campbell moved into the small apartment ms 
abraham shared with her four children on the top floor of a tidy 
sixstory brick apartment building in the south shore district a 
black mostly middleclass neighborhood along chicagos southern 
lakefront 
latties father who kept in touch with his boys and has 
attended court proceedings last saw them in early june 1987 when 
cornelius graduated from kindergarten bigoness said both children 
appeared healthy 
things quickly changed

the children were not allowed to go outside all summer court 
records show andrea harbin a neighbor testified she heard the 
boys crying mostly every day 
their apartment no 612 had no furniture except a sofa the 
older boys bedrooms were closets their beds were cardboard and 
they were fed about once a week cornelius testified 
in haunting testimony the boy said jg had twice tied him 
up with a rope and hung him upside down in the closet once for two 
days he showed the judge scars on his shoulders he said were from 
campbells burning cigarettes 
cornelius said campbell had taken a hot iron and put it on my 
brothers chest and he put that iron on my butt 
the boy said his mother was in the living room watching tv 
at the time 
he told about seeing campbell throw a screaming lattie into a 
bathtub of hot water scrubbing the boys skin with a rag and his 
skin started peeling off 
he told of seeing campbell tie latties wrists to his ankles and 
hang him upside down in the closet once cornelius said his 
mother helped tie up lattie 
campbell had prior battery convictions and a history of mental 
problems and said he drank a fifth of alcohol a day and often 
freebased cocaine he told authorities he beat the children 
because he thought they were gay 
i saw what they were doing they were doing things like 
swishing their butts and screaming like little girls and snapping 
their fingers he told a psychiatrist in an interview 
included in court records 
i wanted to put him in the cupboard so he wouldnt do these 
things campbell said i figured that the pin holes would make 
him stop

competition has given way to cooperation for 
renos hotelcasino owners who hope to breathe new life into the 
citys sluggish gaming business by building new shopping 
attractions downtown 
i remember when casinos through checkerboarding would hang 
onto a little piece of property downtown just to prevent another 
casino from building said buddy frank director of marketing and 
advertising for the fitzgeralds group hotelcasinos 
that doesnt happen anymore he said 
patrick cruzen president of renos flamingo hilton 
hotelcasino agreed 
i think part of the attitude of cooperation is people coming 
together and saying if we really want to make this city grow then 
we have to work together he said 
that attitude is focused today on development sites around the 
rio grande railroads downtown tracks rio grande decided to sell 
the plots which havent been touched for 121 years after a merger 
with another railroad a few years ago 
fitzgeralds flamingo hilton and two other casino groups have 
purchased land bordering the tracks from rio grande in the past 
year they plan to spend millions to build retail shopping 
facilities parking and in one case more casino space to lure 
tourists who want other diversions to go with their blackjack and 
slot machines 
a large percentage of people who come here really want to go 
shopping said pete claudianos iii vice president of sands 
which bought one of the development sites now our customers are 
having to ask how to get a city bus or a cab to renos malls 
the development sites straddle railroad tracks that cut through 
the heart of the downtown casino district home to almost all of 
the citys more than 30 gaming houses 
tourists face steep odds of finding much to do other than gamble 
downtown though jc penney co has a store there along with fw 
woolworth but theyre joined by an array of small souvenir shops 
jewelry stores and pawn shops 
most of the citys 250000 or so residents live outside the 
downtown area and shop at two big suburban malls or other outlying 
commercial areas 
the few stores we do have downtown have real limited 
selections and arent the best of retail frank concedes 
so fitzgeralds has teamed up with a gaming competitor eldorado 
to buy a 232acre parcel they would like to build a retail mall 
on the site that could include specialty shops recreational and 
sports facilities a restaurant and parking frank says 
were in the process of doing public opinion polls right now 
and dont have any firm plans but it looks like the best thing for 
that property is to develop nongaming uses for it frank said 
were even talking about building skyways to connect the four 
casino properties around the railroad tracks and keep people in the 
area he said 
john metzker chairman of fitzgeralds group said two 
feasibility studies should be finished by late march allowing 
final plans to be drawn 
i view this development as mandatory if we want to continue 
advancing our community he said 
the city could use a shot in the arm reno is the states no 2 
tourist attraction after las vegas attracting more than 7 million 
visitors last year according to the renosparks convention and 
visitors authority 
but casino revenues have been sluggish showing singledigit 
growth in recent years compared with doubledigit gains in southern 
nevada and unlike las vegas where a building boom has spawned 
several new casinos reno hasnt seen a new casino go up in years 
although there has been a little expansion of existing facilities 
in the last two years 
the sands has purchased a parcel the size of half a city block 
adjacent to a hotel it is constructing the company plans to build 
a shopping center on the site with 40 specialty stores on two 
levels and 1000 parking spaces on upper floors claudianos said 
the resort needs city approval for the development but could 
finish the shopping center in 1991 he said 
a block from the sands parcel the flamingo hilton has bought a 
16acre lot on which it plans to raise a 26to28story 
1100room hotel and casino plans also call for a health spa 
outdoor pool and two restaurants at the site 
the project is estimated to cost 80 million to 100 million and 
take 22 months to complete cruzen said the resort has obtained 
government approval but its board of directors still must approve 
the plans before construction can begin this spring he added

creditors of the federated and allied 
retailing chains want a federal bankruptcy judge to delay hearings 
scheduled this week on the companies financing plans to operate 
under chapter 11 reorganization 
a delay could threaten 700 million in bank financing the two 
department store chains have arranged which in turn could make it 
difficult to keep store shelves stocked and cash registers ringing 
while the companies try to sort out their debt problems under 
bankruptcy court protection 
the creditors filed the objections monday and tuesday with us 
bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr he has scheduled a hearing 
thursday to consider federated department store incs financing 
proposal and friday on allied stores corps proposal 
the primary objection is the lack of time weve had to 
evaluate the structuring and financing of the proposal said 
chicago lawyer lewis rosenbloom representing unsecured creditors 
of federated 
the creditors also said they need more information to assess the 
proposed financing plans and how they would affect the longterm 
business and financial prospects of allied and federated 
the two cincinnatibased companies represent the 260store us 
retailing operations of torontobased campeau corp together they 
employ about 100000 people 
rosenbloom said tuesday the creditors asked aug to grant a delay 
of at least 30 days to satisfy their concerns about how loans to 
federated and allied would be structured and whether they might 
hurt the companies abilities to obtain loans from merchandise 
suppliers or middlemen 
aug gave interim approval for the financing approvals on jan 
25 and he told creditors lawyers then that he intends to reach a 
final decision on the financing as quickly as possible to help 
ensure that federated and allied can continue operations to the 
longterm benefit of creditors 
the proposals include agreements under which federated 
negotiated a 400 million line of credit and allied obtained 
agreements for 300 million in financing 
lawyers for the citibankled consortium guaranteeing federateds 
financing said the alliance is committed to providing the financing 
only if approval is obtained by feb 14 after that the commitment 
expires and there is no guarantee that banks could be found to 
participate in a new agreement said harvey miller a lawyer for 
citibank 
miller said about 60 percent of the consortiums banks are 
foreign and their managers do not necessarily understand the 
bankruptcy reorganization procedure 
federated and allied filed jan 15 for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act while they develop a 
plan to reorganize their finances it was the largest such filing 
in american retailing history 
the companies are struggling under 75 billion in debt most of 
it accumulated when campeau bought federated in 1988 and allied in 
1986 
allen i questrom the former federated vice chairman hired 
friday from the neimanmarcus retailer as the new chairman and 
chief executive officer of federated and allied met tuesday with 
managers at the companies cincinnati headquarters the bankruptcy 
court last week approved the hiring of questrom under a fiveyear 
contract that will pay him 12 million annually

loyal customers and an upscale image make 
marshall field and co attractive to those hoping to buy the 
department store chain from bat industries inc retail analysts 
say 
most chicagoans fit it into their shopping on sunday said 
george rosenbaum president of the chicagobased research firm leo 
j shapiro associates inc 
its a store that doesnt have to win customers but a store 
that can expand its business by selling more to customers it 
already has he said 
at least half a dozen parties including fields management are 
expected to join the bidding for the 135yearold retailer which 
has 24 stores in four states 
the process begins thursday when the investment firm goldman 
sachs amp co hands out confidential prospectuses to wouldbe bidders 
for both fields and the larger saks fifth avenue chain according 
to a spokeswoman for batus inc a subsidiary of bat headquartered 
in louisville ky 
londonbased bat fields owners since 1982 hopes to announce 
the winning bid sometime in may the spokeswoman said tuesday 
observers have estimated fields will fetch 600 million to 1 
billion 
bat shareholders in october approved a plan to sell the 
companys us retailing operations as part of a restructuring 
designed to thwart a 217 billion hostile takeover bid led by 
anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith 
fields chairman philip b miller and may department stores co 
have said publicly that they want to buy fields others reportedly 
interested in the chain include dillard department stores inc 
dayton hudson corp jmb realty corp and several us investment 
firms representing foreign money 
the winner will get a thriving determinedly upscale chain that 
commands 15 percent of the crowded chicago retail market despite 
stiff competition from bloomingdales niemanmarcus saks and 
others 
retail analyst robert f buchanan of alex brown amp sons inc in 
baltimore said the availability of fields and saks represent a 
brilliant opportunity for someone to become a clear leader in 
the highpriced end of american retailing 
theres going to be a lot of growth there in terms of buying 
power through the end of this century he said its going to 
be a very fertile area of retailing 
miller who moved to fields from the presidents office of 
niemanmarcus in 1983 has engineered a financial turnaround at 
fields overseen an extensive remodeling of the companys flagship 
store on state street and expanded its reach into ohio and texas 
the company also has stores in wisconsin 
the prospective bid by miller in conjunction with a yettobe 
identified partner or partners has generated a good deal of 
excitement here fueling hopes that fields will be returned to 
local ownership 
miller declined to comment on the bidding but in an october 
interview with the chicago tribune he pledged to fight for control 
of fields 
the worst scenario would be to have someone come in here and 
treat it like any old department store and have it become just 
another store miller said this is clearly not what chicago 
wants or deserves 
in the interview miller said that under his leadership fields 
annual sales have gone from about 650 million to more than 11 
billion and annual profit has doubled to an estimated 90 million 
in 1989 from 45 million in 1983

as heads roll during a recession on wall street 
highly paid professionals are searching for new jobs out of fear 
their departments will be the next to get the ax 
at all levels people are more willing to sit down and think 
about what their options are said joan zimmerman executive vice 
president at the executive search firm gz stephens inc which 
places wall street executives 
headhunters report that resume and phone inquiries about 
locating new jobs have zoomed in recent months amid growing 
paranoia wall street professionals are keeping their ears to the 
ground for word of openings often for less money 
a year ago people still had this idea it was a godgiven 
right they make 300000 a year its not the case anymore 
said erica henner president of henner associates inc a 
chicagobased executive search firm 
since the october 1987 stock market crash the securities 
industry has lost about 35000 jobs nationwide in new york wall 
street employment is down to 145000 from a peak of 163000 
according to the us bureau of labor statistics 
merrill lynch amp co the nations largest securities firm is 
cutting more than 3000 jobs no 2 shearson lehman hutton inc 
slashed 800 positions in december and has extended cuts into its 
elite investment banking corps 
people are going on more interviews than they were before 
said a 26yearold executive at a major wall street firm you 
just dont know the cutbacks keep coming 
following the roaring 80s that turned wall street into a river 
of money investment firms are damming up expenses from fancy 
dinners and travel budgets to unproductive workers and entire 
departments 
personnel traditionally accounts for as much as 60 percent of 
expenses at wall street firms and industry officials said firms 
are seeking to trim such costs through layoffs lower salaries and 
reduced bonuses 
for the average guy theres some degree of panic and a lot of 
caution said steven littman managing partner at the executive 
search firm ej rhodes associates inc 
people are concerned about the stability of their future 
said littman whose firm is receiving about five times as many 
calls and resumes as six months ago business heads are falling 
things are changing and people are concerned about whats going to 
happen over the next year or two 
some wall street firms are taking advantage of the insecure 
environment to upgrade departments by luring away talented 
dealmakers often for less money than in the mid80s 
lower 1989 bonuses have made some executives take job offers 
more seriously although the most soughtafter still command higher 
compensation when they jump firms 
after reducing bloated sales and trading forces last year the 
latest cuts are in investment banking which thrived on 
multimilliondollar fees in the takeovermad 1980s but has fallen 
on hard times with dwindling merger activity unlike the 
moneydriven 80s many wall street pros are concerned about 
quality of life and company stability investment bankers for 
instance are joining secondtier or foreignowned firms that 
havent had to shrink because they didnt expand with the reckless 
abandon of major firms recruiters said 
there seems to be less loyalty these days i think people are 
concerned about their own welfare and not the firms welfare 
said gary goldstein president of the whitney group an executive 
search firm 
brokerages also have scrapped computer development projects 
cutting programmers and technicians while backoffice workers who 
process trading paperwork have been laid off as trading volume 
declines 
since two years ago in october our business has decreased 
drastically said jack talabisco president of botal associates 
inc a data processing search firm that now places about 10 people 
a month compared with 40 in 198687 
jim zamparelli president of cross personnel agency inc said 
wall street firms are hiring more parttime backoffice workers 
saving money on salaries and benefits he said his firm gets 50 to 
75 resumes daily 
despite the layoffs times arent that tough for executives who 
still have jobs recruiters said investment bankers with several 
years experience are pulling in around 200000 a year down from 
400000 or more in 198687 but drumming up business isnt easier 
you know that if youre lucky enough to stay youre going to 
be working harder for less pay said a 28yearold former vice 
president whose job was eliminated in a reorganization at a major 
firm late last year 
he added that after several years of sixfigure earnings 
learning to live on 50000 a year is not that difficult

like other slumping wall street firms salomon 
inc said its securities business was barely profitable in the 1989 
fourth quarter while its commodities division recorded a loss 
the firsttier wall street firm tuesday said it managed to turn 
a 68 million quarterly profit because of a strong performance by 
its phibro energy oil refining and trading subsidiary which 
apparently benefited from a strong rise in oil prices during the 
period 
the earnings ended an upanddown year for the securities giant 
which reported a record 28 million firstquarter loss followed by 
a record 253 million secondquarter profit and 177 million 
thirdquarter gain 
in a year of weak performances across wall street salomon fared 
better than some firms 
although salomon didnt disclose details of its securities 
trading analysts said the firm absorbed large fourthquarter 
losses stemming from the stock markets oct 13 minicrash and 
declines in the value of its junkbond portfolio 
you put it all together and it was not a bad year compared 
to the rest of the industry said analyst lawrence eckenfelder of 
prudential bache securities inc but i certainly think investors 
like to see more consistency 
salomon took a beating during the market drop because it held 
300000 shares of ual corp the airline company whose stock price 
plunge after a takeover deal collapse that sparked the market 
selloff eckenfelder said 
in addition salomons 500 million portfolio of highyield debt 
securities was reduced in value because of a steady decline in the 
junkbond market beginning in september he said 
for the period ending dec 31 salomon reported earnings of 42 
cents a share that compared with a loss of 38 million or 42 
cents a share in the same 1988 quarter quarterly revenue rose to 
251 billion from 181 billion 
salomons pretax earnings for the quarter totaled 81 million 
down sharply from 233 million in the 1988 period its salomon 
brothers securities division reported 1 million in pretax 
earnings and the energy segment 125 million but commodities 
recorded a 45 million loss 
in the 1988 quarter the securities segment made 81 million 
before taxes and the commodities division 10 million the energy 
group reported quarterly pretax profits of 142 million a year 
earlier 
a 180 million aftertax charge to cover the cost of shifting 
capital from switzerland to the united states gave salomon a net 
loss in the 1988 quarter 
for the full year salomon reported earnings of 470 million or 
320 a share up 68 percent from 280 million or 163 a share 
in 1988 revenue rose to 576 billion from 363 billion 
overall pretax earnings totaled 740 million down from 753 
million in 1988 
the securities group made 490 million before taxes in the full 
year about level with 485 million in 1988 salomon said lower 
investment banking revenue reflecting slower merger activity and a 
drop in securities underwriting was offset by revenue growth in 
equities government bonds and foreign exchange trading 
the commodities division reported a pretax loss of 117 million 
in 1989 compared with a 48 million profit in 1988 salomon 
attributed the loss to costs associated with discontinued 
operations and firstquarter trading losses in nonferrous metals 
the energy segment made 367 million before taxes last year up 
from 220 million in 1988

the board of beleaguered pan am corp is still 
considering possible combinations with several airlines but no 
decisions were made at its latest meeting sources say 
the airlines board of directors met tuesday amid speculation 
that it was ready to disclose a deal possibly with northwest 
airlines the board finished for the day with no announcements 
however 
the board held a regularly scheduled meeting tuesday morning 
that ended around noon est pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said 
she declined any further comment on the meeting and said pan am 
didnt plan any announcements 
northwest spokesman doug miller in eagan minn said the 
company the nations fourthlargest airline would have no comment 
pan am chairman tom plaskett reiterated to the directors that 
the airline must combine with another carrier to ensure its 
survival northwest was mentioned as a possibility as were other 
airlines said a source close to the situation who asked not to be 
identified 
the directors were not asked to make any decisions the source 
said 
william f genoese director of the teamsters airline division 
said over the weekend that pan am management had leaked word that a 
major announcement probably a deal with northwest would come out 
of the board meeting 
genoese said tuesday that pan am still was trying to work out 
some sort of a merger arrangement with the larger northwest a 
deal under discussion would cut pan am the nations eighthlargest 
carrier to onethird its size genoese said in a telephone 
interview 
he said pan am is seeking a joint marketing arrangement with 
northwest for the next five years with the two carriers continuing 
to operate independently under the umbrella of nwa inc 
northwests parent after five years a full merger might be put 
into effect genoese said in a statement 
pan am faces bankruptcy the statement read it is trying 
to structure a business plan that would satisfy northwests 
management and would also satisfy the banks which would have to 
provide financing 
genoese said he was scheduled to meet with plaskett on thursday 
ms hanlon would not confirm or deny that such a meeting was 
planned 
pan am shares finished down 12 cents at 362 a share on the 
new york stock exchange the stock surged 25 percent on monday in a 
rally market watchers attributed to genoeses weekend comments 
the two airlines have held discussions recently but were a 
long way from a northwestpan am deal said one source familiar 
with the talks 
airline analysts cited rumors that short of merging with 
northwest pan am might sell some of its prized transatlantic 
routes or other assets to the carrier 
new yorkbased pan am has lost nearly 2 billion since 1981 and 
is saddled with 841 million in debt 
last february plaskett said the airline needed to merge with 
another carrier in order to survive pan am offered about 33 
billion last may for nwa but was outbid by a 365 billion offer 
from a group led by investor alfred checchi 
they have to do something one of these days said louis 
marckesano an airline analyst at janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia it probably would take some time to resolve

three video screens sitting in a federal courtroom 
became the first key witnesses in lotus development corps 
copyright suit against two competing software companies 
as charles sullivan a lotus product marketing manager punched 
out financial tables first using the lotus 123 spreadsheet 
program and then the programs from the two competitors the court 
was faced with nearly identical images on each screen 
lotus is trying to prove that paperback software international 
of berkeley calif and mosaic software of cambridge copied its 
popular 123 program 
the case does not focus on the inner codes of the programs 
which experts agree fall under copyright protection but instead 
concentrates on the keyboard commands associated with the programs 
and how the images appear on the screen 
lotus contends those elements known as the user interface 
signify the expression of an idea and are thus protected under 
copyright laws legal experts however say this area of the law is 
unclear 
on tuesday lotus representatives spent more than three hours 
presenting computer displays as they opened their case three video 
screens were installed so people in the courtroom could watch the 
results of each command us district judge robert e keeton 
meanwhile had his own private screens to monitor the proceedings 
there were a few technical glitches such as when one screen 
broke down for several moments forcing the judge to share his 
screens with defense attorney paul gupta 
sullivan gave the court a basic lesson in organizing a 
spreadsheet placing sample financial results in various columns 
and rows 
he also demonstrated more complex functions such as setting up 
graphs and mortgage rate charts 
ive done this 10000 times before for prospective 
customers sullivan said during a break obviously ive never 
done it here before 
sullivan then performed the same basic functions on the two 
other screens setting up a financial chart using paperback 
softwares vpplanner program and then with mosaics twin classic 
program 
sullivan went through similar sequences of keystrokes and 
commands and the result was three screens sitting side by side 
showing identical arrangements of columns and rows for the 123 
vpplanner and twin classic programs 
the only significant difference between the two displays was 
that the lotus program had a menu of options such as file 
copy and edit at the top of the screen while the other 
two programs had the menu at the bottom 
in contrast lotus demonstrated another competing program 
microsoft excel which required different commands 
basically i created the same spreadsheet as i did on 123 
but did it in a totally different manner sullivan said 
but gupta representing paperback software said after the 
hearing that the comparison with microsoft excel was unfair because 
that program operates on different types of hardware 
gupta planned to elaborate his points when he crossexamined 
sullivan on thursday when the attorneys also are scheduled to 
present their opening arguments 
gupta contended that tuesdays hearing demonstrated 
instructions for a machine rather than the expression of an 
idea 
but in its court affidavits lotus countered that assertion 
saying the system of commands and screen images were the product of 
careful thought 
mitchell kapor who was lotus founder and coauthor of 123 
outlined in one affidavit how he helped develop the program and 
decided upon each element 
the choice of words selected to represent commands and their 
organization in the menu tree i believed would be critical to the 
success of the user interface especially for the novice user he 
said 
lotus also provided statements from bernard galler a professor 
of electrical engineering at the university of michigan who said 
the creation of the user interface requires the software 
developer to make subjective choices decisions and judgments 
galler said the 123 program reflects one of many possible 
models for spreadsheets but the vpplanner and twin programs 
virtually duplicate lotus product 
court affidavits filed by the defense included statements from 
james stephenson the designer of vpplanner 
stephenson said he was working on his program and was taking an 
approach similar to lotus before the commercial release of 123 
in january 1983 
but as the lotus program grew in popularity it became apparent 
to stephenson that his product which was introduced in october 
1985 should be compatible with 123 
vpplanner could not offer the functional attribute of macro 
compatibility unless keystrokes entering the same letters or moving 
the cursor to the same location would bring about the same 
functional result as in lotus 123 he said

a hong kong investment firms battle for a 
seat on the board of cummins engine co has moved to the nations 
capital with both sides seeking the hearts and minds of congress 
industrial equity pacific ltd through its parent new 
zealands brierley investments ltd asked rep john d dingell 
dmich to stay out of the fray until the outcome of a federal 
lawsuit by cummins 
that request was included in a filing with the securities and 
exchange commission dingell has asked the sec to review ieps 
dealings with cummins 
dingell is chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
which oversees the securities industry particularly the sec its 
federal regulator 
late last month indianas congressional delegation wrote 
dingell asking him to request an sec review of ieps investment 
activities with us companies including cummins iep owns a 
15percent stake in the company 
without making specific allegations the letter to dingell said 
if iep treats cummins as it allegedly has several other us 
companies a strong american business could be dismembered 
the congressional letter went on to describe iep as a hong 
kong corporate raider and an entity with a history of 
greenmail 
greenmail is the payment made by a company to buy back its own 
stock at abovemarket prices from an unwanted suitor 
but brierley chairman bruce a hancox in a letter of his own to 
dingell said the indiana delegation have been misled by false 
baseless and libelous allegations 
cummins would have you believe that we invest for shortterm 
plunder rather than longterm growth that is simply not so he 
wrote 
dingell asked the sec and the federal trade commission which 
oversees antitrust matters to review the iep actions an energy 
and commerce committee staffer said 
the staffer said the committee had not seen hancoxs letter and 
therefore could not comment 
cummins filed its suit against iep at federal court in 
indianapolis last month after iep sought a seat on cummins 
15member board 
as one of 15 directors and the only nonus director i doubt 
i would have posed a threat to corporate policy hancox said in 
his letter to dingell 
in another filing with the sec on monday iep said it was 
reevaluating its cummins holdings

casino industry officials are trying 
to put the best face on figures showing atlantic city suffered the 
first decline in visitors since gambling was legalized in 1978 
this may just be a temporary hiatus or dip said steve 
richer the president of the atlantic city convention amp visitors 
bureau 
richer and industry analysts on tuesday described the 3 percent 
drop in annual visitors as the inevitable levelingoff of the 
casino boom 
i dont think its drying up said john uphoff a casino 
analyst with raymond james amp associates in st petersburg fla 
its kind of getting a second wind if you will 
the figures compiled by anthony marino an atlantic city 
expressway executive show that 321 million people visited the 
seaside resort last year down from 331 million in 1988 the 
number had risen steadily since the 70 million recorded in 1978 
the year atlantic citys first casino opened 
blair learn a spokesman for the convention bureau said the 
figures include many repeat visitors the actual numbers of people 
who came last year range between 5 million and 6 million learn 
estimated 
uphoff said the drop probably could be attributed to the opening 
in november of steve wynns mirage casino in las vegas nev 
in addition he said potential visitors might be awaiting the 
opening of donald trumps taj mahal casino to be the worlds 
largest this spring in atlantic city 
uphoff predicted atlantic city would rebound this year with the 
introduction of the taj mahal and the lotterytype excitement 
generated by a linked multicasino progressive slots system known 
as megabucks 
the statistics show a 12 percent decline in the number of people 
reaching the city by bus a development richer said he welcomed

an agreement with the federal government 
to build a 660 million cleanburning coal generator marks a step 
toward easing the acid rain associated with highsulfur coal a 
utility company executive says 
american electric power service corp announced tuesday the 
agreement with the us department of energy to build a generator 
that will have sharply reduced emissions of the substances that 
cause acid rain 
american electric power co aep services parent company is 
the nations largest buyer of coal 
the project is part of the does 5 billion clean coal 
technology program which aims to develop coalburning generating 
plants that reduce emissions of sulfer dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
by as much as 95 percent compared with existing plants 
the doe has agreed to pay 185 million of the cost of building a 
pressurized fluidized bed combustion unit at american electric 
powers 40yearold philip sporn plant in new haven wva the 
utility said in a news release 
our goal is to demonstrate that pfbc is capable of helping the 
nation meet its environmental goals more effectively than current 
technology said james j markowsky senior vice president and 
chief engineer of aep service the management and technology arm of 
american electric power 
the project was outlined in a report by the doe to congress 
tuesday government funds for the plant can be granted following a 
30day congressional review the department said 
pressurized fluidized bed combustion technology will allow the 
sporn plant to burn highsulfur coal cleanly and boost the plants 
electric output the doe said the project will replace two 
conventional coalfired boilers 
the technology could be critical for american electric power 
which relies largely on coal to supply power to 7 million customers 
in seven midwestern and appalachian states clean air legislation 
pending in washington could force the utility to cut its emissions 
sharply in coming years 
the project also has implications for the regions coal 
industry which mainly produces coal with a high sulfur content 
a fluidized bed system captures acidrain causing pollutants 
inside the coal boiler as part of the combustion process 
to capture sulfur gases limestone is mixed with crushed coal 
and fed into the boiler as the coal burns sulfur pollutants are 
absorbed by the limestone and removed as solids from the bottom of 
the boiler the doe said 
boilers using the process can burn coal at a lower temperature 
than conventional boilers which reduces nitrogen oxide emissions 
when the refitting is finished the sporn plant will be the 
worlds largest pressurized fluidized bed plant with a capacity of 
330 megawatts with conventional equipment the sporn plant 
produced a maximum 300 megawatts of power the doe said 
testing at the sporn plant is to begin in the summer of 1996 
the plant is jointly owned by the ohio power co and the 
appalachian power co both whollyowned subsidiaries of 
columbusbased american electric power 
american electric power said it will begin operating a 70watt 
pressurized fluidized bed plant this year at brilliant designed to 
test the technology 
the utility cautioned that its efforts to commercialize the 
cleanburning technology could be hindered if congress enacts clean 
air legislation requiring utilities to fit scrubbers on existing 
plants or retire plants early it said it doesnt have the 
resources to pursue both strategies

mailing a love letter paying the phone bill 
and chewing out your congressman likely will cost more next year 
postage rates appear headed up again 
the postal service is poised to launch the long complex process 
of raising prices on march 6 
postmaster general anthony m frank says a 30cent stamp seems 
likely for first class mail in 1991 although the final price could 
be from 28 cents to 32 cents first class postage rose to the 
current 25cent rate on april 3 1988 
if things follow the normal course the new charges would take 
effect about 11 months after the filing or in february 1991 
frank doesnt expect the new proposed raise to play well 
noting a 5cent increase would be a 20 percent raise 
substantially above the 14 percent he projects that consumer prices 
will have risen from 1988 to 1991 frank said recently he was 
committed to paying back to the american people that 6 percent 
difference 
to do that he has pledged to keep future increases below the 
inflation rate and said tuesday we may very well be able to hold 
increases in rates after the 1991 adjustments to one more increase 
in the balance of this century 
the postal service managed to operate about 404 million in the 
black for the first quarter of this fiscal year but the agency 
expects a record 16 billion deficit for the full year ending 
sept 30 the postal service is required to break even over the 
long run 
frank has cited a number of reasons for the planned 1991 rate 
increase 
we were required in 1988 and 1989 to contribute 800 million 
to deficit reduction even though we dont use a penny of tax money 
health benefit costs are out of control a problem we share with 
the private sector he said 
the first official step in raising rates will be taken march 6 
when the postal services board of governors is to vote on the 
proposed increase 
the independent postal rate commission then will ask for comment 
that should produce tons of reports and appeals from various 
interest groups and hold lengthy hearings before making its 
recommendation 
it then will be up to the postal service board to put the new 
rate into effect 
franks comments came in a jan 25 speech to the economic club 
of indianapolis the postal service made a text of his remarks 
available thursday 
frank has said he wants to lengthen the period between rate 
increases but his efforts have been complicated by federal budget 
woes the postal service was separated from the federal government 
in 1971 and its tax subsidies were eliminated 
it was returned to the federal budget in the 1980s when the 
agency was showing a surplus it then was taken back off the 
federal budget but was also required to take over some retirement 
and medical payments for employees of the former us post office 
at a cost of millions of dollars 
while public attention focuses on the rates for first class 
mail the rate increase will cover all classes details on the 
other proposed increases are not yet available although those 
increases are expected to spark opposition from advertisers 
charities and publishers of magazines and newspapers 
here is a rundown of the cost of mailing a firstclass letter 
since 1863 when the first flat rate was created at 2 cents per 
halfounce in 1885 prices were set to cover a full ounce 
july 1 1885 2 cents 
nov 3 1917 3 cents 
july 1 1919 2 cents 
july 6 1932 3 cents 
aug 1 1958 4 cents 
jan 7 1963 5 cents 
jan 7 1968 6 cents

the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 36496 points or 097 
percent closing at 3730187 it had gained 3542 points tuesday 
the poor performance in the japanese government bond market 
made stock investors especially institutional ones step off to 
the sidelines said kozo hasunuma a dealer with yamaichi 
securities co 
while dealers made position adjustments other investors sold 
spot issues to collect profits from the price spread between the 
future and spot markets hasunuma added 
the nikkei began falling as soon as wednesdays trading opened 
amid uncertainties over the us government bond auction and the 
soviet communist party central committee meeting said a nomura 
securities analyst speaking on condition of anonymity

s gorbachevs performance in the meeting to lead to further 
reforms and stability but they cant wipe out all the

bank 
traders said investors were buying west german marks in 
anticipation that gorbachevs initiatives in the soviet party 
meeting would help maintain stability in eastern europe expected 
to benefit west german companies 
shinomiya said the currency market reacted positively to 
japanese purchases of threeyear us government bonds but 
japanese investors were expected to buy fewer of the 10 and 
30year bonds this would reduce demand for dollars to pay for the 
bonds

world demand for oil is projected to increase in 
the 1990s but the opec nations will need financial help to meet 
that need and avoid another oil crisis the organizations general 
secretary says 
in an address to some 400 international energy industry 
executives subroto said tuesday the 13 members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries will have to increase production 
capacity to meet the projected demand for oil in this decade 
while world demand for oil is projected to rise in the 1990s 
nonopec supply is expected to fall subroto said during a twoday 
meeting on oil and gas strategies in the 1990s 
subroto said research by opec also indicates an oil crisis would 
come at the point when our organization no longer has the 
production capacity to meet the rising level of demand 
thus there is a requirement to expand opec production 
capacity rapidly subroto said 
but such an increase will cost money he said and opec members 
would financial assistance from nonopec parties in the 
international oil market 
we are simply talking about a level of expenditure well in 
excess of our financial capabilities as a group of 13 developing 
countries said subroto who is from indonesia 
if we wish to avoid a crisis we have no alternative course to 
follow for without an adequate and rapid expansion of 
production capacity there will sooner or later be a tightening of 
supply and a rapid rise in prices followed by years of severe 
fluctuations in market behavior and considerable wastage of our 
finite oil reserves he said 
but subroto said the amount of money needed to raise production 
capacity is indeterminable at this stage and this requires a 
detailed study in its own right 
he also called for increased communication cooperation and 
mutual trust and respect between opec members and nonopec parties 
the atmosphere of confrontation which for so long 
characterized relations between opec producers and the consuming 
countries must be put firmly behind us he said 
in addition he cautioned against implementing protectionist 
measures on oil products 
the introduction of discriminatory import levies and extra 
taxes on oil products to protect highcost domestic energy 
industries or to reduce budget deficits would make the goods of 
such a country less competitive in international markets he said 
meanwhile the international energy agency estimated tuesday 
that opec slashed oil production last month but not enough to meet 
its promised goal 
the agency said the opec nations produced about 233 million 
barrels of crude oil a day in january that was about 700000 
barrels below decembers peak levels but still well above the 
22millionbarrel limit opec pledged late last year 
opec ministers agreed in november to cut daily production to 22 
million barrels for the first half of 1990 although the ceiling 
was 205 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 1989 actual 
production had reached 24 million barrels a day in december boosted 
by excess flow from saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab 
emirates 
analysts had expected opec members to rein in production even 
more in january to try to meet the new limit which was intended to 
boost oil prices

the operators of a pesticide unit in a 
highly populated valley have promised to notify officials of deadly 
gas leaks after a release of of methyl isocyanate renewed debate 
over chemical plant safety 
the small amount of methyl isocyanate the same gas that killed 
3500 people at bhopal india escaped from rhonepoulencs 
institute plant on friday and injured seven contract workers plant 
management thought the leak was of little significance and did not 
report it until monday 
in the area of getting information to the public its very 
clear that we misjudged the situation plant manager ron bearer 
said tuesday at a special meeting called by kanawha county 
officials to correct this situation in the future all 
releases of acutely toxic materials no matter how small will be 
communicated 
the occupational safety and health administration is 
investigating to determine why workers were injured rhonepoulenc 
which shut down the unit last wednesday for a scheduled week of 
maintenance said it now would be closed indefinitely 
mark wolford kanawha countys emergency services director said 
the county rather than the company would determine whether the 
kanawha valleys 250000 residents should be notified 
when there is a product that is leaked that would impact on 
the health of the community we have to let the people know 
wolford said he added however that the county also must not go 
overboard with its alerts 
the rhonepoulenc plant is a former union carbide operation and 
includes the only true sister unit to a carbide unit that leaked in 
bhopal in december 1984 
in the five months after the bhopal leak union carbide shut 
down the unit at institute and installed millions of dollars worth 
of safety equipment to prevent leaks it sold the unit in december 
1986 
during a routine maintenance operation friday plant workers 
trying to jar a stuck pipe lowered vacuum pressure designed to keep 
the gas from escaping into the atmosphere when they loosened the 
pipe a gust of methyl isocyanate blew past them 
bearer said it wont happen again 
they were given the leeway to adjust the vacuum as required 
he said what we are doing now is going through and changing 
those procedures clearly we want to maintain a vacuum on there 
its very important its a change that has to be made 
the institute plant is 10 miles west of charleston along west 
virginias 15milelong chemical valley which includes a string of 
two dozen chemical plants 
methyl isocyanate is an ingredient in agricultural pesticides 
primarily the popular temik rhonepoulenc usually has 200000 
pounds on hand to convert to intermediate compounds bearer said 
union carbide said the bhopal leak occurred after saboteurs let 
water into a storage tank setting off a reaction the indian 
government accused carbide of shoddy workmanship the parties 
agreed to a 470 million settlement that a new indian government is 
seeking to void

chrysler vice chairman gerald greenwald said at a news conference 
the agreement begins a new era for the american automobile 
industry 
greenwald and gm executive vice president william hoglund said

motor co was in the works 
it has taken some time to bring us this far greenwald said 
each of the big three has joint vehicle manufacturing agreements 
with other automakers mainly japanese the gmchrysler 
transmission proposal sailed through federal antitrust review 
prompting some critics to complain that the government wasnt 
taking a strong enough role in regulating big business

the west german government today created a 
committee to prepare for eventual german reunification and agreed 
to pursue immediate talks with east germany on using a single 
currency 
rudolf seiters chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff said 
the select committee began its work today under the chancellors 
leadership other panel members include cabinet ministers in kohls 
government 
seiters said the panel will examine all the steps and decisions 
necessary for unification including creation of a monetary union 
east german economic reforms and legal questions as well as issues 
of foreign policy and security 
west germany will discuss confederative cooperation with 
east germany after east germanys first free elections on march 18 
seiters said 
he made the announcement after kohls cabinet met to hear the 
chancellors proposal for urgent talks with east germany on uniting 
the two nations currencies which would be a giant leap toward 
reunification a monetary union would make the west german mark 
east germanys currency and turn over much of east germanys 
economic sovereignty to west germany and its central bank 
economics minister helmut haussmann said a germangerman 
economic miracle like the one that made west germany wealthy is 
possible as the two countries draw closer together but that much 
work needs to be done 
kohl under domestic pressure to relieve the influx of thousands 
of east germans seeking better jobs and housing in the west said 
tuesday people in east germany must see now that citizens of 
west germany are ready to help 
nonetheless new signs are emerging that both german states may 
have to make huge sacrifices to rescue east germanys ailing 
economy 
a newspaper quoted officials as saying that under reunification 
west germany would have to pay billions to salvage east germanys 
economy 
in east berlin today three leftist opposition movements agreed 
to join forces and campaign as a coalition for east germanys march 
18 elections said the adn news agency the three are new forum 
democracy now and the initiative for peace and human rights said 
adn new forum is east germanys bestknown prodemocracy movement 
three conservative opposition groups including the democratic 
awakening also have joined forces for east germanys first free 
elections 
also today authorities said ousted east german communist party 
leader erich honecker who faces charges of high treason will be 
tried together with three of his former lieutenants before the 
countrys supreme court next month 
lother reuter deputy attorney general said the four face 
charges including blatant human rights violations complete 
hindrance of media freedom and deformation of the peoples 
economy 
kohl said details for talks with east germany on reunification 
would be worked out when premier hans modrow of east germany visits 
bonn next week 
kohl did not give a deadline for the monetary union but 
government sources said on condition of anonymity that kohl shared 
finance minister theodor waigels view that it should come before 
the end of the year 
the newspaper bild said waigel wants east germans to be able to 
exchange their currency for west german marks at a 11 ratio the 
current official rate is three east marks for one west mark 
but waigel also expects the process of creating a freemarket 
economy in east germany will result in a huge loss of jobs until 
new positions under new economic conditions can be created bild 
reported 
according to bild waigel is proposing that west germany pay out 
unemployment benefits to east germans left jobless by economic 
overhaul and has estimated that would cost 6 billion annually 
helmut geiger head of the west german savings bank association 
said monetary union would cost the west germans a doubledigit 
billionmark sum 
he said that would probably lead to tax increases in west 
germany higher budget deficits and an end to talk of shorter work 
weeks 
the head of west germanys central bank karl otto poehl also 
has voiced reservations about a speedy monetary union 
east german officials while acknowledging that sharing the same 
currency could ease some immediate problems generally have 
resisted such a move because of fears that it would erode the value 
of east german savings 
they also fear that unprofitable state enterprises would have 
to close forcing large layoffs 
an accelerating exodus to west germany strikes and absenteeism 
are driving east germanys economy toward the brink of collapse

in june 1988 us comptroller of the currency 
robert l clarke told banks that aggressive uncontrolled expansion 
can lead to deep trouble 
growth for growths sake or growth without the resources to 
back it up is a highly risky strategy because it leaves the bank 
exposed when the economy turns down he said 
those words read like an epitaph for the texas banking industry 
where eight of the 10 largest holding companies were failing 
crushed by awesome credit losses during a bust in the oil economy 
but up in new england clarkes message was a prophecy of things 
to come 
banks caught in the euphoria of a construction boom have watched 
the economy turn sour the real estate market has tumbled giving 
banks a staggering amount of bad loans and putting one of the 
regions largest banks bank of new england corp in a fight for 
survival 
these troubles echo the story in texas but analysts say new 
england should not have a repeat performance even though bankers 
apparently failed to learn from mistakes made in the southwest 
i suppose they thought it could happen to dumb texans but not 
happen to wise conservative yankees said l william seidman 
chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp poor management 
shows up when the economy goes bad 
the new england banking industry in recent months has resembled 
an infirmarys list of wounded 
among the nine states that showed the biggest increases in 
troubled real estate loans from december 1988 to last september 
six were in new england industry estimates show 
bank of boston corp the regions largest bank reported a 
record 125 million loss for the third quarter of 1989 and for the 
year it had a 78 percent drop in earnings 
bank of new england said osses in 1989 should surpass 1 
billion and it is trying to sell 6 billion in assets 
analysts say bank of new england has been one of the biggest 
victims of the regional real estate slump since it competed 
aggressively to make construction loans earlier in the 1980s 
sacrificing sound credit policies in order to build its empire 
the eagerness shown by bank of new england and other banks to 
lend their money for construction projects is one of the biggest 
similarities to what happened in texas experts say 
the economies in both regions had been robust in texas the 
driving force was oil and energy while in new england it was 
largely the hightech and defense industries 
the growth in these economies fueled rapid buildups in office 
space and housing providing a quick avenue for banks to boost 
assets by making construction loans in both cases however this 
led to excessive speculation by developers which resulted in 
overbuilding 
thus as the texas economy and then the new england economy 
began to slide building projects had trouble finding tenants 
developers couldnt make loan payments and the banks lost money 
it was one big party said gerard cassidy a banking analyst 
with tucker anthony inc in portland maine then the party 
stopped and now the hangover started 
there were projects built that should have never been built 
no question said leo spang senior vice president of commercial 
real estate at shawmut bank in boston 
but spang said the trouble is more manageable in new england 
partly because the economy is more diversified and there simply was 
much less speculation 
analysts agree with that assessment and they say new england 
should not experience the flurry of bank closings similar to what 
occurred in texas 
the texas debacle was so much greater in size and magnitude 
cassidy said but he added there are too many similarities to 
rule out that new england will become another texas 
banks in texas and in new england each made the same mistake in 
judgment said alex sheshunoff president of sheshunoff amp co a 
banking information and consulting firm in austin texas 
they underestimated the capacity of builders to overbuild 
he said as the phrase goes the demand was for a million square 
feet of space and 10 developers went out and built it 
some banks in new england showed more restraint 
fleetnorstar financial group inc in providence ri for 
example quit making loans for condominiums about three years ago 
said robert lougee a company spokesman 
the condo market in particular has been a major source of 
troubled loans but at fleetnorstar there were obviously some 
who saw overdevelopment going on lougee said 
he noted however that banking officials foresaw a downturn in 
the real estate market based on their own experiences not on any 
lessons from texas 
its sort of the history of finance said robert litan a 
banking expert with the brookings institution in washington no 
one learns from the last disaster especially when they didnt have 
any part in it 
the federal government though appears to have learned from the 
texas experience and analysts say regulators have been more swift 
to crack down on new england banks 
here its taking regulators only several weeks to realize 
whats going on said mas kakutani a banking analyst with 
moodys investors service inc in new york the deterioration of 
new england banks has been more severe than anything we saw in 
texas in terms of quickness 
we are certainly trying to reflect some of the lessons learned 
from texas said seidman at the fdic 
seidman said regulators were taking a cautious look at new 
england before the serious problems surfaced and he said officials 
in the future will pay closest attention to banks that grow the 
fastest 
once bitten twice shy he said

grain and soybean futures prices were slightly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting stronger cash markets for soybeans and improved foreign 
demand for us grains 
broadly underpinning the gains were reports that communist party 
leaders in the soviet union have approved sweeping political 
reforms recommended by their leader mikhail gorbachev 
the soviets swing toward democracy is seen as increasing the 
chances the united states will grant mostfavoredtrade status to 
the soviet union which could lead to bigger grain deals with the 
united states 
a slowdown in farmer selling is helping to boost soybean 
futures as is an increase in soybean meal demand in europe 
analysts said 
signs of stronger export demand for corn are helping corn prices 
while wheat is gaining amid indications of a sale of us wheat to 
egypt 
in early trading wheat futures prices were cent to cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in march at 383 a bushel

georgia gulf corp said wednesday it scheduled a 
meeting april 19 for shareholders to vote on a recapitalization 
plan intended to discourage a takeover by texas investor harold c 
simmons 
nl industries inc a houstonbased chemical supplier controlled 
by simmons has launched a 11 billion tender offer for georgia 
gulf despite the proposed recapitalization 
the atlanta commodity chemical maker said shareholders of record 
feb 18 will be eligible to vote on the proposal valued by the 
company at 55 a share nls offer is 45 a share 
georgia gulf stock was up 25 cents a share to 4175 in early 
new york stock exchange trading today 
in january georgia gulf announced the recapitalization proposal 
after months of speculation over simmons intent he owns about 9 
percent of georgia gulf and had indicated an interest in boosting 
the value of his investment 
the proposed recapitalization had been regarded by wall street 
analysts as a move to placate simmons by paying a special dividend 
of more than 50 a share a recapitalization generally involves a 
company borrowing a large sum of money to pay shareholders a 
special dividend or to expand the company 
georgia gulf chairman james r kuse earlier this week appealed 
to stockholders to delay making a decision on nls buyout offer 
until the companys management reviews the bid and makes a

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee criticized the bush administration today for not 
recommending specific price support levels and other spending 
details in its 1990 farm bill proposal 
we cant write a farm bill without an idea of what the 
administration wants sen patrick leahy dvt told agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter at a hearing of the agriculture 
committee i want specifics 
yeutter said he would immediately start negotiations over 
spending with the committee if leahy desired but he said he 
thought such talks should be in a private setting instead of a 
public hearing 
the administration will not declare today what its position 
is on target prices said yeutter 
he noted that the fiscal 1991 budget called for 102 billion 
overall for target prices but would not say how the money should 
be distributed he also refused to suggest target price amounts for 
the other four years of the fiveyear farm bill 
leahy said the administration was putting congress in a damned 
if you do damned if you dont position on spending 
yeutter said he preferred to work it out with the committee so 
he would not be alone in sticking out his neck 
i want to make sure there are 20 necks there instead of just 
one he said 
this document doesnt deal with budget it deals with 
policy yeutter told a news conference tuesday in unveiling 
proposals for the 1990 farm bill 
i see no reason why we should not be able to provide net farm 
income that would give a very satisfactory standard of living to 
farmers even though the federal contribution will decline he 
said 
leahy said there were positive aspects in yeutters proposals 
such as planting flexibility and emergency food aid programs 
but he said the administration still refuses to actively 
help farmers cut pesticide and chemical use 
shortly before yeutter unveiled his proposals 11 national 
consumer and environmental groups released a report outlining 
certain environmental objectives they want incorporated into the 
next farm bill 
the public is demanding that we protect our environment and 
safeguard our food supply said sen wyche fowler dga an 
agriculture committee member who spoke at a press conference with 
the coalition 
he said the nation needs a stronger and less begrudging 
commitment to integrated pest management lowinput farming and 
other promising alternatives in usda research and extension 
programs than we have seen up to now 
leahy said in a statement that proposals by the organizations 
will be an important part of the debate over the 1990 farm bill 
and will be taken seriously 
the groups offered suggestions for preserving water quality 
wetlands and fertile soil and promoted incentives for 
sustainable agriculture a farming method that avoids extensive 
use of chemicals 
yeutter also offered groundwater proposals and said the planting 
flexibility he would like in the new legislation should please 
those promoting sustainable agriculture which uses crop rotation 
among other methods to protect the environment 
house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas 
played down the importance of the administration proposals he and 
rep edward madigan rill introduced their farm bill monday 
de la garza said the administration proposals may have an 
impact as we deliberate our bill there are no items in our bill 
and the administration proposals that cannot be worked out 
highlights of yeutters recommendations include 
a normal crop acreage concept to allow farmers to plant 
crops based on market demand without loss of farm program benefits 
it would define crops that could be substituted for program crops 
authorize cropspecific acreage reduction programs and provide 
authority to plant on idled acres in exchange for giving up 
specified deficiency payments 
replacing crop insurance with a new crop disaster resistance 
program patterned after the ad hoc disaster legislation passed in 
1988 and 1989 following the drought it would eliminate need for 
such ad hoc bills yeutter said 
a grain reserves and stocks policy based on annual contracts 
that give the farmer more say in when stocks should be released 
into the marketplace 
making the trigger for acreage reduction programs more 
consistent with market and farmer needs 
extending the loan rate formula for wheat and feedgrains to 
upland cotton extra longstaple cotton and rice the 1985 loan rate 
formula for soybeans also would be extended 
incentives to use perennial cover crops on setaside acreage as 
a means to naturally improve soil fertility 
methods for cutting down fraud in use of food stamps grants to 
organizations that test innovative ways to get food stamps to the 
homeless

anheuserbusch cos inc said wednesday its 
recently announced discount program held fourthquarter earnings to 
a 2 percent increase but the move helped the company improve its 
share of the national beer market share by a full point 
earnings for the fourth quarter were 1281 million or 45 cents 
per share on sales of 249 billion compared with earnings of 
1255 million or 44 cents per share on sales of 237 billion in 
the same period a year ago 
august a busch iii chairman and president said that as a 
result of the price discounting program beer sales grew by 22 
million barrels in 1989 widening the companys lead over its 
nearest competitor by 700000 barrels and increasing its market 
share by one point to 421 percent 
our volume increased by 28 percent reaching a total of 807 
million barrels during the year said busch our growth rate 
gave us a larger volume and market share increase than any other 
brewer 
busch acknowledged that fourth quarter earnings were affected by 
the discounting program but he said increases in sales to 
retailers were encouraging 
we anticipate that our longterm market share growth strategy 
will ultimately pay off in an even stronger market position and in 
higher earnings for the company and its wholesalers he said 
earnings for the full year reached 7672 million or 268 per 
share on sales of 1028 billion up from earnings of 7159 
million or 245 per share on sales of 971 billion in 1988 
busch said the companys goals in the next five years are to 
increase beer wolume to achieve a 50 percent market share and to 
further expand its nonbeer profit base with additional investments 
anheuserbusch the worlds largest brewer has led the industry 
in sales every year since 1957

while many conservative investors are chasing 
interest rates in the bond and cd markets a lesser publicized 
group is loading up on corporate dividends 
surprisingly the dividend rates of some pretty solid companies 
equal and sometimes exceed rates available from bonds and 
certificates of deposit 
among them general motors and ford motor at better than 7 
percent manufacturers hanover bank at about 10 great northern 
iron about 9 perkins family restaurants at 8 occidental 
petroleum nearly 9 
lesser known but often higher paying are several investment 
trusts for example the massachusetts financial services 
multimarket income trust and the hancock investment trust both 
offer about 10 percent 
meanwhile us treasury debt securities supersafe 
investments generally are in the range of about 85 percent 
highgrade corporate bonds about 9 percent or slightly more and 
taxexempts around 7 
while some advisers recommend lockingin the current yields on 
bonds before and if they rise in price the same advice can be 
given for dividends stocks too can rise sometimes sharply adding 
to the investors total return 
in fact based on longterm records some stocks paying high 
dividends may also be underpriced general motors for example is 
selling at between six and seven times earnings and ford only four 
times well below market averages 
the reason dividends get overlooked has a good deal to do with 
the changing nature of the market decades ago the level of 
dividends was often the primary consideration among investors that 
was before the gogo days 
in the past two decades market advisers have tended to 
emphasize shortterm price performance to look for takeover 
candidates for stocks that might rise with the introduction of new 
products for companies with sudden earnings increases in such an 
atmosphere longterm dividend prospects count little 
rather pallid looking dividend payments didnt help especially 
in the stock market boom following the early1980s recession in 
1978 and 1979 dividends averaged 6 percent but since 1986 theyve 
averaged under 4 percent 
averages always permit exceptions however and included in the 
exceptions are companies that appear underpriced by longterm 
standards should they rise in price there is a chance the 
dividends might even increase 
however even if the dividends do not increase the price of the 
stock might 
international business machines for example offers a dividend 
yield at just under 5 percent it is also selling at 15 times 
earnings well below its norm should it return to form current 
owners would have locked in both a solid dividend plus a hefty 
return from the appreciated value of their stock 
nobody knows what the future holds but there is a sense in wall 
street and other investment centers that the emphasis might return 
to longerterm performance and that investors might be ready to 
reemphasize fundamentals 
if so it is possible that you might hear ordinary investors 
listening for tips about overlooked companies with solid earnings 
and solid dividends in short what investors used to look for 
before the swingers moved in

if youre tired of waiting the usual six to 
eight weeks for your income tax refund uncle sam will gladly let 
you cut in line but the privilege costs money 
the internal revenue service has expanded its electronic tax 
filing system nationally this year allowing anyone due a refund 
or about 70 percent of the 110 million expected returns to file 
directly into the governments computers those owing money cant 
participate 
last year 36 states were plugged into the system up from 14 
states the previous year and three cities when it was first tested 
in 1986 
the irs says the hightech approach will save an overburdened 
agency about 200 million in processing costs over 10 years and 
substantially reduce errors that will mean speedier refunds for 
taxpayers filing electronically about three weeks vs the usual 
six to eight weeks from filing the oldfashioned way by mail tax 
experts say those choosing to receive their refund through direct 
bank deposit can expect the money in about two weeks 
but like anything else the taxpayer must pay for this 
efficiency many accountants warn that unless youre expecting a 
refund well into four figures it may not be worth it 
the economics are clearly not there for some people said 
stephen corrick a tax partner for the accounting firm arthur 
andersen amp co its also not for people with complicated 
returns 
the irss embrace of preapproved electronic filing has spawned 
a new type of accounting service that will transmit your return via 
computer for a fee individuals cant use personal computers to 
file directly on their own yet 
filing fees range from around 20 to 50 with costs usually 
lower for individuals whose returns are prepared by the same 
services many companies will advance you the return within days 
for an additional 30 to 35 fee 
for those needing money in a hurry or without available credit 
lines it may be worth paying the added expense 
but you have to ask yourself what is the time value of the 
interest associated with my getting the refund said richard h 
lager a managing partner with the grant thornton accounting firm 
for example if you invested a 1000 refund check in a money 
market account at 9 percent interest that interest compounded 
annually would amount to only 750 a month its probably a lot 
cheaper to get a onemonth cash advance from your credit card 
even at the 18 percent interest than to pay the fee of the 
electronic filer lager said 
kansas city mobased hampr block inc is clearly the largest of 
the nations tax preparers to participate in the program last year 
it filed 70 percent of the 12 million returns sent electronically 
said harry buckley president of hampr blocks tax preparations 
division 
in addition niche companies such as san diego califbased 
instatax have set up thousands of storefronts nationwide in which 
consumers can fax their forms to a data processing center which 
in turn enters the return immediately on a computer connected to 
the irs 
customers who use these services still have to send out a short 
form which is their proof of signature and attach their their w2 
forms and other documentation 
some electronic tax filing services accept floppy disks or 
direct transmission from an individuals personal computer 
storebought programs such as mcintax will do the arithmetic 
pcusers may some day be able to file directly on their own but 
irs spokesman frank keith thats a long time away since the 
technology is not quite there yet 
this year though the irs is working with a handful of banks in 
the boston area testing how taxpayers who owe money can file 
electronically and have the amount deducted from their accounts 
keith said 
for now the irs is promoting its refund electronic filing 
system offering lists of accountants and companies hooked into its 
computer for those calling a tollfree number 
as of feb 1 the irs received 608350 electronic returns about 
8 percent of all the returns received so far keith says the agency 
predicts it will get at least 2 million electronic return this tax 
season up from 12 million for 1989 only 25000 were received 
when the program began four years ago 
by the end of the century the irs predicts that at least 30 
percent of all returns will be electronically keith said 
editors note the irs tollfree number is 18004241040

there is no peace dividend yet and there may 
never be one but proposals for spending it already are being 
offered by individuals and groups with a cause 
now comes an original one dont spend it give it back to the 
people 
the proposals to spend the dividend some say are examples of 
the urgency with which advocates activists elected officials and 
supporters of big government promote private agendas at the 
publics expense 
as imagined the peace dividend would result from a quick 
cutback in the united states defense budget as world tensions ease 
freeing billions of dollars for use elsewhere 
but it will never exist says economist stuart butler so long 
as eastern europe and the soviet union remain in turmoil and so 
long as there is no consensus in the united states regarding future 
defense needs 
in spite of this butler and his heritage foundation colleagues 
said they found advocates of various programs already holding news 
conferences to propose ways in which to spend the money therefore 
they offer theirs 
butler director of domestic policy studies at heritage a 
conservative think tank proposes 11 tax cuts totaling more than 
107 billion a year in relief each member of congress was 
scheduled to receive a copy this week 
1 reduce the tax burden on the elderly by eliminating the 
social security earnings test 
currently americans between ages 65 and 69 who earn more than 
9360 are required to give up 1 in social security benefits for 
every 3 they earn 
this is an effective 33 percent tax on earnings on top of all 
the other federal state and local taxes that are deducted 
according to the paper the effect it says is to drive such 
people out of the work force 
2 index the social security benefits tax for inflation 
3 roll back social security payroll taxes and return social 
security to payasyougo financing this is the proposal already 
put forth by sen daniel moynihan dny 
4 increase the personal income tax exemption to 6300 for each 
child under 18 years of age from its current level of 2000 
commentary if the tax burden on families were reduced most 
families could meet their childrens needs according to their own 
priorities and would not need new government programs 
5 provide tax credits to households to cover medical expenses 
and health insurance premiums 
6 provide tax incentives for the purchase of longterm care 
insurance 
7 designate 100 federal enterprise zones to spur economic 
development in the inner cities 
8 reduce the capital gains tax 
9 expand the earned income tax credit or eitc 
the eitc is a tax credit for lowincome workers with children 
butler and staff maintain that when combined with other welfare 
programs an expanded eitc might lift a single mother from poverty 
even if she earned the minimum wage 
10 provide a toddler tax credit 
the heritage analysts say the current childcare crisis as it 
is sometimes termed could be solved by giving money directly to 
parents so they could determine how best to care for their children 
11 restore ira eligibility to all individuals 
the 1986 tax reform act sharply curtailed the number of people 
who could qualify for individual retirement accounts in which 
savings accumulate free of taxes 
says butler remind your representatives in congress that 
dividends are normally paid to investors the people not kept by 
the corporation congress

mcdonnell douglas helicopter co will lay off 
more than 10 percent of its employees by feb 23 because of reduced 
defense spending by the government company president william p 
brown announced today 
the move will involve about 400 workers each at the companys 
base plant here and at its california manufacturing center in 
culver city calif the company employs 5900 in mesa and 1650 in 
culver city 
we must reduce our workforce to meet the reality of our 
delivery schedule with the us army brown said in a prepared 
statement 
the plant here has been producing apache helicopters for the 
army at the rate of 10 per month brown said that number would be 
reduced to six a month in june under a contract which ends in 
mid1993 
he said the company still has good prospects of international 
sales of apaches 
the other step in the companys retrenchment is elimination or 
delay of discretionary spending brown said 
that means postponing a proposed expansion here to accommodate 
production of the new mdx and md520n and md530n helicopters the 
expansion was scheduled to begin last month but brown said the 
plan had been put on hold 
other casualties of the moratorium on noncritical spending will 
include employee travel participation in industry trade shows and 
replacement of nonessential equipment 
competing in world markets particularly with reductions in 
defense spending requires strong measures to be taken brown 
said mcdonnell douglas helicopter co continues to be an 
industry leader in financial strength as well as in the quality of 
the products we produce

the us dollar finished mixed against major 
currencies wednesday in nervous european trading with continued 
interest in the west german mark 
gold prices rose 
a lack of marketmoving news made dealers reluctant to trade

when jack hesse talks about seed capital he means well 
seeds 
broccoli seeds onion carrot corn 
most venture capitalists use seed capital to describe money 
invested in a range of risky startup companies to help them sprout 
a product 
hesse who heads the bostonbased plant resources venture fund 
is one of a growing number of venture capitalists to concentrate 
investment on just one industry 
socalled focused funds may target only chemicals or retailing 
or biotechnology or entertainment for example in hesses case 
its agribusiness 
focused funds evolved partly because of disappointment in the 
mixed performances of much broader venture capital funds in recent 
years 
in the 1980s there were too many plainvanilla funds using the 
same investment strategies said mark radtke a vice president 
at the bostonbased investment firm advent international corp 
but to perform well you must have a competitive advantage 
because managers of focused funds usually have extensive 
experience in the industry they invest in they are better equipped 
to spot innovation and far more likely many say to back startups 
than large diversified venture capital companies 
charlie bass holds a phd in electrical engineering and has 
founded and run a handful of telecommunications companies his 
4monthold bass associates inc in palo alto calif invests 
strictly within that industry 
bass recently pumped money into racotek inc a mobile radio 
startup in minneapolis that links truck radios with personal 
computers 
the large generalpurpose funds are both less able and less 
willing to play in these earlystage specialized markets bass 
said 
in addition they dont have as much time to do handson work 
with smaller companies said larry coleman president of franklin 
venture capital inc in nashville tenn 
coleman a former executive of hospital corp of america and a 
biochemistimmunologist by training invests in medical product and 
service companies in less than three years his 18 million fund 
has invested in 16 companies more than half of them startups 
a year ago coleman backed flying nurses inc a nurse staffing 
startup in dallas that has grown more than tenfold in both revenue 
and income he said 
proponents of focused funds say its much too early to judge 
their success rate nonetheless some venture capital experts say 
the focused strategy is flawed because its so narrow 
are there enough deals that are good financial investments and 
fit in a particular sector radtke said the more focused you 
are the harder it can be to generate deals 
focused fund managers don phillips and cece smith dispute that 
argument they say they review 600 to 700 business plans a year 
before picking the four or five choicest prospects 
phillips is a former chief executive of pearle health services 
which runs a chain of eyecare centers he and smith another 
expearle executive formed phillipssmith specialty retail group 
a dallasbased fund that invests only in innovative retailers 
mostly startups 
after three years the group has 70 million under management 
making it a startup success in its own right 
despite the success stories the venture capital business is in 
flux the amount of venture money invested over the past few years 
has varied between about 3 billion and 4 billion but the amount 
of new money raised for venture capital funds has fallen 
last year for example private venture funds raised an 
estimated 24 billion down 43 percent from the 1987 peak of 42 
billion said venture economics inc a needham massbased 
research concern 
the money is declining and theres probably some 
consolidation going on said tom baruch a partner of chemicals 
and materials enterprise associates in boston people with 
special expertise will be sought out 
baruch enticed corporate giants including 3m exxon and ford 
motor co to contribute at least 3 million apiece to a fund 
investing in materials technologies they see it as an 
opportunity to get a window on new technologies he said 
focused funds are crossing international boundaries 
representatives of advent western pacific management for example 
have been visiting financial institutions in the united states and 
asia seeking 35 million to be funneled into australias tourism 
industry 
the melbournebased fund already has raised 8 million part of 
which has financed cruise ships that tour sydney harbor and the 
murray river the fund also has an equity stake in the sydney 
aquarium and theme park 
venture capitalists are maverick and often eccentric 
businesspeople whom entrepreneurs turn to when banks reject their 
loan applications typically money is exchanged for a stake in the 
company and perhaps a seat or two on its board of directors 
rather than take a passive role venture capitalists nurture a 
company often forming close ties with the entrepreneurs 
the big payoff theoretically comes when venture capitalists 
either sell a company or take it public in a stock offering 
returns can be astronomical 
but the ability to divest a company largely depends upon the 
prevailing mood in the marketplace this can put focused funds at a 
special disadvantage 
you are at the mercy of what the stock market is saying about 
the industry radtke said you dont have complete control over 
what the background economy is going to be when you want to exit 
these companies 
an inability to divest a company is definitely an issue 
said bass of bass associates it puts an added premium on working 
in a robust segment of the market 
it is too early to measure the success of focused funds against 
their diversified counterparts 
funds younger than three years old are still investing and 
probably have no returns theyre like a child said stephen 
piper of venture economics you dont know if theyll grow up to 
be a criminal or the president

times mirror corp posted profit declines of 
235 percent for the fourth quarter and 102 percent for the year 
due in part to lower earnings at many of its eastern newspapers and 
in its consumer magazines and broadcast tv operations 
the big communications and publishing company said wednesday it 
earned 741 million or 57 cents per share in the 
octoberdecember quarter compared with 968 million or 76 cents 
per share in the same period in 1988 
revenue rose 11 percent for the quarter from 925 million to 
935 million despite the fact that the quarter included six fewer 
days of newspaper operation than the same period of 1988 
fourthquarter 1989 results reflected a loss provision of 6 
cents per share on the expected sale of newspaper press equipment 
the comparable 1988 earnings included a gain of 1 cent per share 
from asset sales excluding those factors pershare earnings would 
have declined 16 percent from 75 cents to 63 cents times mirror

percent from 227 to 225 the company said timberlands and 
other assets were sold in 1988 a gain from selling timberlands in

police may like kip fuller for keeping drunks off 
the road but theyre not too happy that he helps speeders outwit 
radar traps by turning cars into ground versions of a stealth 
bomber 
fuller invented the guardian interlock which deactivates a 
cars ignition system if the driver cant pass an alcohol 
breathalyzer test they are used by law enforcers in at least 18 
states 
the denver inventors latest innovation is known as a stealth 
car bra so named because it resembles a brassiere strapped to the 
front of a vehicle 
made of radarabsorbing carbon fibers the bra enables a car to 
fool police radar until it reaches close range permitting drivers 
to spot the trap and slow down before their speed is clocked 
im not antigovernment said fuller 33 i try to develop 
products that assist the government in doing its job 
but how does a stealth car bra help the government 
fuller smiled it keeps them on their toes 
his idea for the guardian interlock stems from his conviction 
for driving under the influence at age 19 afterward fuller 
recalled in an interview he asked himself why someone hadnt 
thought of a product that would help prevent drunk driving 
the why part of that question got me thinking about a method 
of prevention it sure would have helped me back then he said 
to start a car equipped with the guardian interlock a driver 
must breathe into a mouthpiece attached to an alcohol sensor for 4 
seconds if the drivers alcohol level is above the level deemed 
safe the ignition remains locked 
judges around the country are ordering convicted drunk drivers 
to buy and install the 300 system in their vehicles as an 
alternative to paying fines or serving jail time fuller said 
fullers stealth car bra also resulted from experience 
honestly i was a little tired of getting speeding tickets 
but more than that i believe the government uses radar technology 
to generate revenue the public has a right to defend itself if the 
government uses clandestine methods fuller said 
radar he said often gives inaccurate readings because the beam 
from a radar gun spreads like the light from a flashlight stealth 
technology forces a police officer to wait until the vehicle is 
closer to get a speed reading improving a drivers chances of 
spotting the officer and slowing down first 
the bra protects drivers from unfair readings that result in 
unjustified speeding tickets he said 
the bra which starts at 299 depending on the auto make and 
model is custommade to fit most domestic and foreign cars 
fullers creations have gained him national and international 
recognition as president and founder of innovisions research co 
he has combined inventiveness and marketing savvy to create a 
growing business 
innovisions research in operation just over a year employs 
seven people fulltime and makes use of about 20 subcontractors 
revenue for 1990 is projected at around 2 million fuller said 
fullers career as an inventor or innovator as he prefers to 
be called began when the drums he made from chlorine cans won 
second prize at a third grade school fair 
inventing was a way of getting things my parents or i couldnt 
afford he said 
fullers first commercial success or so he thought came at age 
22 a sports fanatic he designed a foldaway trailer to haul his 
motorbikes and other equipment too large to fit in compact cars 
only after taking out a second mortgage on his home to finance the 
venture did he realize he was losing 25 per trailer because of 
distribution problems still he was undeterred 
an idea has very little value until its proven to be a 
commercial success fuller said 
his first financial success came was the servitron robot a 
vinyl 4feettall remotecontrol toy that serves drinks at 
parties it racked up nearly 3 million in sales its first year 
the mechanical influx of cash made it possible for fuller to 
develop and market other creations orthopedically designed pants 
for skiers with bad knees a condo for cats handles for skis and 
mitts for icescrapers 
i just look at different areas objectively sometimes people 
in a specific industry are so close to the subject that they cant 
see the areas where improvements or additions are necessary i try 
to remain the observer so i dont get too wrapped up in a 
product fuller said 
one of fullers latest demonstrations of technological 
shrewdness is an electronic alarm that guards parking spaces set 
at the front end of a parking space park guard 1000 uses 
ultrasonic waves to detect unidentified vehicles that come within 5 
feet of the alarm a voice message then is triggered warning 
reserved parking please move your car or it will be towed if 
the vehicle is not moved a shrill alarm sounds 
fuller said his inventions serve two functions they are fun 
like his aqua tunes which allows lap swimmers to listen to music 
while they swim or they provide a public service like the 
guardian interlock 
although he now enjoys a comfortable life because of his 
business success fuller said his ideas are largely a result of 
working for himself and avoiding a dreary 9to5 job 
thats why most adults arent so creative fuller says 
who has the time to create im lucky i get to make the time

grain futures prices closed mostly higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade paced by moderate gains in 
soybeans amid signs of tighter supplies and worsening growing 
conditions in south america 
farmer selling of soybeans has been slow recently and analysts 
noted some movement of beans out of deliverable positions against 
the march futures contract 
the movement indicates that the prices that both soybean 
crushers and gulf coast shippers are paying are high enough to 
cover the costs of transporting the beans to them said anne frick 
senior oilseeds analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york 
broadly underpinning the gains in all markets were reports that 
communist party leaders in the soviet union have approved sweeping 
political reforms recommended by their leader mikhail gorbachev 
the nations swing toward democracy is seen as increasing the 
chances the united states will grant mostfavorednation trade 
status to the soviet union which could lead to bigger grain deals 
with the united states 
at the close wheat futures were cent lower to 1 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in march at 382 a bushel corn 
futures were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with march at 239 a 
bushel oats were 1 cents to 1 cents higher with march at 137 a

its a bluechip rally said brad weeks head of equity

companies that provide telephone operator 
services for travelers were warned wednesday that they may face 
stiff government regulation because of widespread complaints they 
are picking the pockets of unwary callers including members of 
the us senate 
sen alan dixon dill said the federal communications 
commission which last year issued rules to govern alternative 
operator services companies is receiving 150 complaints a month 
from angry callers who feel theyre being overcharged or not being 
allowed to use the longdistance carrier of their choice 
the operator companies contract with hotels hospitals airports 
and other public institutions to handle dial o calls on 
longdistance lines leased from a major carrier the operator 
companies pay a commission to the premises owner 
dixon testifying before a senate subcommittee considering two 
bills that would crack down on alleged abuses and possibly regulate 
prices noted that under the fcc rules five major aos companies 
were to identify themselves and allow callers upon request to 
reach their own longdistance carrier 
i submit to you that this not being done and our constituents 
continue to fall prey to these unscrupulous practices dixon told 
the senate commerce science and transportation telecommunications 
subcommittee 
he said callers were getting bills from a city where they never 
were resulting in two charges for one call often well in excess 
of rates charged by american telephone amp telegraph co mci or us 
sprint which actually carry the calls for the operator service 
companies 
dixon said a staff survey of four washingon hotels and one 
restaurant served by the operator companies found violations of the 
fcc rules particularly that signs be placed on phone informing 
callers of the name of the service provider 
dixon told of being charged 16 for three calls from operator 
services companies that would have cost 7 using a presubscribed 
longdistance carrier 
that prompted subcommittee chairman sen daniel inouye 
dhawaii to acknowledge that he too had had a bad experience with 
one of the alternative operator service companies last month 
inouye said that when such things occur to a subcommittee 
chairman some action can be expected 
representatives of the companies and the chief telephone 
regulator at the fcc richard firestone said complaints have 
dropped by half since the fcc rules went into effect 
the company officials said they are beginning to police 
themselves after a period of growing pains and that they soon 
will have the technical capability to connect callers with all 
longdistance companies 
the companies have flourished since the breakup of atampt opened 
competition in the 12 billion market for assisted telephone calls 
critics say the commission system gives the operator companies no 
incentive to hold down prices 
dixons bill would deny commissions to any institution that did 
not allow phone users to reach the longdistance carrier of their 
choice if a company continued to serve a facility that blocks 
calls the operator companies would not be allowed to charge more 
than the lowest rate available from other longdistance companies 
for the same call 
dixons bill also would prohibit a alternativeoperator company 
when it cannot complete a call from handing off the call without 
warning to another longdistance company that results in two bills 
one of which is from a location where the customer never was 
sen john breaux dla has introduced a bill identical to a 
measure passed by the house last year his bill incorporates the 
fcc rules and requires that the companies file prices for approval 
by the fcc

negotiations to relieve the crushing debt 
burden on third world countries should progress more smoothly now 
that mexico and its creditor banks have signed a debt reduction 
agreement a senior bush administration official predicted 
wednesday 
the strengthened debt strategy is very much alive and well 
treasury undersecretary david c mulford architect of the 
administration debt plan told the house banking subcommittee on 
international development 
the mexican agreement signed sunday in mexico city is the first 
under the administrations yearold brady plan named after 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
the strategy emphasizes reducing a borrowing countrys debt and 
the interest it must pay in contrast with the reagan 
administration strategy that sought to provide new loans in return 
for economic reforms by the borrowers 
mulford acknowledged that 10 months had passed since the start 
of talks between mexico and representatives of its 450 creditor 
banks but he said the pact eased the way for agreements by other 
countries 
banks now accept that they must reduce the debt of developing 
countries and the borrowing nations have a more realistic 
expectation of how much relief they can get he said 
the banks at the time of the mexican negotiation were in the 
early phase of coming to terms with the elements of the strategy 
the principles of debt reduction and debt service reduction are 
now established and i sense a greater flexibility at this point on 
the part of banks mulford said 
costa rica and the philippines both have reached agreement in 
principle on new financing packages and venezuela and morocco are 
actively negotiating with banks he said 
however delegate walter e fauntroy ddc chairman of the 
subcommittee said the pace of negotiations clearly needs to be 
speeded up if countries are to receive relief within a 
reasonable period 
rep joseph kennedy dmass said the debt pact while moving 
in the right direction did not provide the mexican government with 
enough relief to revive its economy 
but rep jim leach riowa said the mexican deal compared with 
other relief packages for foreign countries was surpassed only by 
the marshall plan aid to europe after world war ii 
its always easy to say a good program isnt good enough 
the fact of the matter is this agreement has to be seen as 
truly historic and monumental leach said 
mulford said the agreement reduced mexicos overall foreign debt 
from 95 billion at the end of last year half of it owed to 
foreign banks to about 80 billion by march 1 from 1989 to 1992 
mexicos annual interest payments will be reduced by about 
onethird to 15 billion principal payments will be 67 billion 
less over the period 
mexico also will get about 15 billion in new loans from banks 
mulford said that proved new bank lending and debt reduction can 
coexist in the same financing package

the dollar closed higher against major 
currencies in domestic trading wednesday but the west german mark 
continued holding center stage on world foreign exchange markets 
gold prices declined in us dealings but moved mostly higher 
abroad 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 41810 a troy ounce 320 lower than 
tuesdays close republic national bank in new york quoted an ounce 
of gold bullion at 41810 as of 4 pm est down 260 from 
tuesdays late bid 
the dollar has been playing a supporting role to the mark lately 
because reforms in the soviet union and eastern europe are expected 
to benefit the west german economy said keith raphael second vice 
president of foreign exchange at chase manhattan bank 
meanwhile negative sentiment toward the dollar has prevailed 
amid speculation that a softening us economy will be accompanied 
by interest rate declines lower us rates would reduce returns on 
dollardenominated investments tending to curb demand for dollars 
regardless the dollar managed to gain against its foreign 
counterparts in what us dealers described as a technical rebound 
overseas the dollar turned in a mixed performance 
dealers said developments in moscow with soviet communist party 
leaders agreeing to give up their monopoly on power as proposed by 
president mikhail s gorbachev already had been factored into 
foreign exchange markets

recovering from an early slump prompted by concerns about the 
treasurys refunding auction 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 3378 points to

in nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks 
with 941 issues up 567 down and 443 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 18671 million 
shares up sharply from 13407 million in the previous session 
the market opened lower in what analysts said was a response to 
weakness in the bond market reflecting worries about interest 
rates and the treasurys quarterly refunding the dow jones 
industrials were down more than 20 points shortly after the opening 
bell 
investors were almost waiting for the market to go lower so 
they could get some good bargains said michael metz technical 
analyst with oppenheimer amp co as soon as that happened they all 
came into the market at the same time and that sparked a rally 
high technology stocks which lead the advance helped revive 
the blue chip sector before midday bouts of computerized program 
trading fueled the upward move once the rally got under way 
traders said 
stocks retained their upward momentum in afternoon trading after 
what appeared to be a good turnout for the treasurys sale of 10 
billion in 10year notes bond prices rallied in the aftermath of 
the auction and were up fractionally late in the day 
it looks like the refunding is going well said brad weeks 
head of equity trading for donaldson lufkin amp jenrette reports 
are the japanese bought about 25 to 30 percent of the notes 
the threepart 30 billion auction which started tuesday with 
the sale of 10 billion in threeyear notes ends on thursday with 
the auction of 10 billion in 30year treasury bonds 
worries about the refunding have plagued the bond market and 
depressed stock prices in recent sessions in particular investors 
were concerned that yields would be forced higher to compete 
against overseas rates and attract japanese investors foreign 
investors particularly the japanese are an important source of 
funds into us credit markets 
despite the rally some wall street analysts said underlying 
market fundamentals remained bearish and predicted a continued 
shortterm downtrend in the market once the refunding is over 
the real problems are floundering profits and rising interest 
rates which are deadly for the stock market said larry wachtel 
equities analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
when the refunding is out of the way then the problems will 
reoccur said weeks people will start talking of poor 
corporate earnings again and about what might happen in the first 
quarter and the market will go down again

soybean futures prices rose moderately wednesday on the chicago 
board of trade amid signs of stronger demand and drier growing 
conditions for the south american crop most grain futures also 
advanced 
on other commodity markets gold futures retreated energy 
futures were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mostly 
higher 
soybean futures settled 3 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march up 5 cents at 567 a bushel 
wheat futures settled cent lower 1 cents higher with march at 
383 a bushel corn futures were 1 cents to 1 cents higher with 
march at 239 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 1 cents higher with 
march at 137 a bushel 
the soybean rally occurred on light trading volume and was not 
remarkably strong compared with the markets permitted daily limit 
of 30 cents 
yet the 5cent gain represented the markets sharpest upward 
move since jan 29 when it staged a reversal that many analysts 
interpreted as a sign that soybean prices had bottomed 
march soybeans rose 4 cents on tuesday 
analysts said some of wednesdays buying probably reflected a 
growing belief that the market is indeed heading higher also the 
days little news was bullish 
anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc noted that farmer sales of soybeans have slowed 
recently and that some owners of physical soybeans have been moving 
them out of deliverable positions against the march futures 
contract 
the movement indicates that the prices that both soybean 
crushers and gulf coast shippers are paying are high enough to 
cover the costs of transporting the beans to them ms frick said 
furthermore the weather has turned drier in southern brazil a 
prime soybeangrowing region after good rains last week which may 
have prompted some buying 
analyst walter spilka of smith barney harris upham amp co said 
active buying of soybean and corn futures by cargill inc a large 
grain merchant sparked speculation of new export sales of those 
commodities 
reports that spain was bidding 50000 metric tons of us 
soybeans took traders by surprise and also helped the rally spilka 
said 
if you want a bottom line to this whole thing prices have 
fallen enough in the near term to stir a little export interest at 
least on a short term basis he said 
gold futures sank on new yorks commodity exchange on selling 
related to a strong late rally in the stock market 
gold settled 320 to 350 lower with february at 41810 a 
troy ounce silver futures finished 01 cent 05 cent higher with 
march at 5336 a troy ounce

oil and refined products 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents lower to 10

suffering from a recall of its flawed dbase iv computer program on 
wednesday reported a fourthquarter loss of 1 million 
the loss for the octoberdecember quarter equivalent to 4 cents 
a share compared with a net profit of 134 million or 51 cents a 
share in the fourth quarter of 1988 
fourthquarter revenue fell 29 percent to 621 million from 
873 million ashtontates fiscal year used to end on jan 31 as 
of 1989 the company changed to a calendar year ending dec 31 
therefore its latest results are compared with results for the 
period ended jan 31 1989 
for the year ended dec 31 ashtontate lost 286 million or 
109 a share compared with a net profit of 477 million or

by 14 percent to 2653 million from 3073 million 
the dbase programs are ashtontates core products the dbase iv 
version designed to help small businesses and office work groups 
track data was released in october 1988 then had to be pulled off 
the market when ashtontate was besieged with complaints about 
glitches 
since then ashtontate has been forced to lay off 15 percent of 
its work force and has shown big losses as it struggles to bring to 
market an improved version of dbase iv known as dbase iv 11 
the latter program is nearing the end of an extensive 
prerelease series of tryouts with software developers corporate 
users and distributors ashtontate chairman edward m esber jr 
said reaction to it has been good 
we believe that the worst is behind us he said in a 
conference call with reporters wednesday 
asked about the chance of additional layoffs or if ashtontate 
might be a takeover target he said no company can honestly give 
you assurances on either one 
but he added we do not plan any layoffs at this time and plan 
to remain independent

capacity of the nations strategic petroleum 
reserve would be expanded from 750 million to 1 billion barrels of 
crude oil under legislation introduced wednesday by sen j bennett 
johnston 
johnston dla said his bill also would provide for the 
leasing rather than the purchase of crude oil to fill the vast 
louisiana and texas underground salt domes where the emergency oil 
is kept 
the senate committee on energy and natural resources of which 
johnston is chairman has scheduled hearings feb 27 on the 
legislation 
johnston said 150 million of the additional 250 million barrels 
of crude would be stored in one of several louisiana sites being 
considered the balance would be put in one of three possible texas 
locations 
johnston quoted industry sources as saying the louisiana 
expansion could result in up to 1000 construction jobs several 
hundred permanent hirings and an economic impact ranging from 400 
million to 500 million 
he said expansion of the reserve was needed because its original 
intended capacity was 1 billion barrels and numerous studies have 
supported that capacity 
the message from doe is dont worry be happy with a 
smaller spr a weaker insurance policy and a shorter lifeline for 
this country if oil supplies are threatened johnston said in a 
news release referring to the us department of energy

analysts generally welcomed a report 
wednesday on the imminent departure of jeanlouis gassee apple 
computer incs flamboyant newproduct developer who often was 
touted as the visionary for the personal computer maker 
gassee once was considered a possible successor to john sculley 
apples chairman and chief executive officer his reported 
resignation comes during a tumultuous reorganization of the 
company which has suffered declining sales for a year 
it appears that the speed with which new products were being 
kicked out the door is the major complaint against gassee and to 
the extent that this is an attempt to correct this very serious 
problem the resignation is both good and bad news said abigail 
christopher an analyst at international data corp a 
hightechnology research firm in framingham mass 
theyve got to make a change its painful but its got to be 
done said paul gillin executive editor of computerworld an 
industry newsweekly in the long term its going to be positive 
because what apple needs is a shakeup 
gassee 46 who has headed the cupertinobased companys 
newproduct development for five years will leave the company 
within the next few weeks according to a report wednesday in the 
wall street journal 
an industry source who used to work at apple speaking on the 
condition of anonymity told the associated press some apple 
employees were notified of the resignation in a memo on tuesday 
however apple officials said gassees departure was far from 
certain 
no announcement has been made said apple spokesman 
christopher escher and jeanlouis gassee continues as the 
president of apple products obviously because of recent 
organization changes jeanlouis gasee has been in discussions with 
john scully for some time regarding jeanlouis future role within 
apple 
escher declined to comment further 
apples stock lost 150 a share to close at 3325 wednesday in 
national overthecounter trading 
the report of gassees departure follows by a week the 
resignation of allan z loren who headed apples domestic sales 
and marketing division the companys largest 
the same day lorens departure was disclosed apple named 
michael h spindler the companys chief of european operations to 
the new post of chief operating officer it gave spindler 
supervision of the domestic operations as well as two departments 
that had been under gassees oversight since 1988 product 
marketing and manufacturing 
the journal reported sculley had pressured gassee to accept a 
demotion 
since the 1985 departure of apple cofounder steve jobs gassee 
who once headed the european operations concentrated on improving 
the technical depth of apples macintosh 
under his direction apple introduced an updated version of the 
original macintosh called the se and a redesigned version called 
the macintosh ii apples first machine with a color monitor and a 
full range of addon options 
but gassee was criticized for failing to introduce new 
lowpriced models and for the companys portable computer which 
many of the companys legions of stalwart users complain is bulky 
slow expensive and difficult to read 
gassees departure will leave a giant hole in the management 
of the company said bruce lupatkin an apple analyst at hambrecht 
amp quist a san francisco brokerage 
but while it will be difficult to replace the colorful gassee 
who often wore an earring and once cursed at a reporters question 
during a news conference lupatkin said it would not be impossible 
since jobs departure in 1985 he had been promoted as the 
individual responsible for the companys vision but if you look at 
whats hes delivered i dont think theres a great loss in 
vision lupatkin said 
peter rogers an apple analyst with robertson colman stephens in 
san francisco was more blunt its difficult to exalt him 
in its latest quarter apple suffered an 11 percent decline in 
profit from the comparable period a year earlier it was the third 
consecutive quarter the company reported a decline in both revenues 
and profit from the previous year with most of the problems 
centered in lorens division 
as a result apple which had revenues of 53 billion in 1989 
said it would cut employment by 5500 mostly through attrition and 
reassignment but would not rule out the possibility of layoffs it 
also froze salaries for six months and made other cutbacks 
rogers said apple the worlds no 2 personal computer maker 
after international business machines corp needs to replace 
gassee quickly and smoothly 
more than the loss of the man himself apple doesnt need a 
lot more turmoil rogers said 
many industry observers fear the personnel changes and the 
possibility of layoffs are damaging morale at the company which 
once was famed for its collegial operations 
besides losing sales apple faces a critical year in 1990 from 
major competitors who will be introducing or improving their own 
graphical interface products the programs that use symbols to 
allow the user to tell computers what to do

wednesday it will lay off 800 employees and postpone a 20 million 
expansion planned for its commercial helicopter line because of 
reduced us military spending 
the company also threw a blanket prohibition on discretionary 
spending such as employee travel and replacing noncritical 
equipment 
a number of elements have made these steps necessary 
company president william p brown said 
competing in world markets particularly with reductions in 
defense spending requires strong measures to be taken he said 
in a statement mcdonnell douglas helicopter co continues to be 
an industry leader in financial strength as well as in the quality 
of the products we produce 
his statement mentioned participation in trade shows as a 
casualty in the retrenchment ironically brown and other top 
officials could not be reached for comment because they were 
attending a helicopter show in dallas 
brown said the permanent layoffs will affect about 400 workers 
at the base plant here and another 400 at the companys california 
manufacturing center in culver city calif the layoffs will begin 
feb 21 and the last day of work for those affected will be feb 
23 he said 
the company plans to host an employment fair to try to help 
employees find new work in other ways brown said 
together the layoffs affect more than 10 percent of the 
companys workforce the company the helicoptermaking subsidiary 
of mcdonnell douglas co of st louis employs 5900 in mesa and 
1650 in culver city 
mcdonnell douglas helicopter laid off 450 apache workers and 
reduced parttime and contract work last may 
about 3200 production workers here manufacture the apache 
we must reduce our workforce to meet the reality of our 
delivery schedule with the us army brown said 
the plant has been producing the 99 million apache for the 
army at the rate of 10 per month brown said that would be reduced 
to six a month in june under a contract which ends in mid1993 
in addition the company recently wrote off 137 million on 
helicopter programs after reestimating material costs of several 
government contracts the writedown contributed to a 17 million 
operating loss in the fourth quarter of last year 
brown said the company retained hopes of strong international 
sales of apaches

january pushing up the cost of living a hyperinflationary 8164 
percent over the past 12 months according to the official national 
institute for statistics and census 
also wednesday the austral slipped 155 percent against the 
us dollar falling to a rate of 2960 to the dollar from 
tuesdays closing rate of 2500 the plunge since last fridays 
closing rate of 1990 to the dollar amounts to 328 percent 
bankers and analysts say the expansion of the money supply by 
the central bank is fueling inflation and pushing investors to get 
rid of their australs by buying dollars 
the central bank in need of funds to cover the national budget 
deficit and to pay off bonds that are falling due printed 13 
trillion australs 439 million at wednesdays rate in january an 
amount equivalent to 355 percent of the money supply 
the governments inability to control inflation the fiscal 
deficit and the australs value prompted international monetary 
fund negotiators on tuesday to withhold payment of the 230 million 
second installment of a 14 billion loan approved last october 
i cant claim things are going well because that would be 
lying president carlos menem told reporters but he insisted the 
economic situation was stabilizing and the government will not 
reimpose exchange controls to prop up the austral

eddie antars lawyers said he refuses to 
repatriate 52 million because it might incriminate him but a 
judge said the reclusive founder of crazy eddie inc would have to 
come to court himself if he wants to exercise his fifth amendment 
rights 
the securities and exchange commission says it wants the money 
brought back to this country in case it wins its insider trading 
case against antar us district judge nicholas h politan last 
month ordered the money to be placed in the care of a trustee in 
the united states 
the judge rejected arguments wednesday that the mere act of 
repatriating the money could be seen as an admission of guilt and 
hence a violation of antars fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
after his ruling attorney jack arseneault said his client 
refused to send back the money and offered a sworn statement by 
antar asserting his right against selfincrimination politan was 
not satisfied 
i think i got to see his body said the judge 
antar is believed to be living in new york city 
later in the day politan issued an order requiring antar to 
respond at 930 am thursday to why he should not be held in 
contempt of court antar is expected to respond by pleading the 
fifth which will then give his lawyers the opportunity to appeal 
the contempt and repatriation orders to the 3rd us circuit court 
of appeals 
without a contempt hearing said arseneault antar probably 
could not appeal the repatriation order 
the sec sued antar and other top officials of the chain for 
insider trading antar allegedly directed a massive financial 
fraud to artificially boost the companys income enabling him to 
sell his stock at falsely high prices and reap millions of dollars 
in illegal profits 
the sec says antar transferred the proceeds to bank accounts in 
israel and grand cayman island in 1987 
through his attorneys he has denied the charges

it looks as if itll cost a nickel more to 
mail a letter next year 
the increase which would be the first since 1988 and the 
largest ever will be before the postal service board of governors 
when it meets march 6 if things follow their normal course rates 
would go up in february 1991 11 months after the process begins 
there have been proposals to raise the firstclass rate to 28 
cents to 32 cents for the first ounce but postmaster general 
anthony m frank sees 30 cents as the most likely 
and he doesnt expect the raise to play well 
noting that a fivecent increase would be a 20 percent raise 
substantially above the 14 percent he projected that consumer 
prices will have risen from 1988 to 1991 frank said recently that 
he was committed to paying back to the american people that six 
percent difference 
to do that he has pledged to keep future increases below the 
inflation rate and said tuesday that we may very well be able to 
hold increases in rates after the 1991 adjustments to one more 
increase in the balance of this century 
that he told the postal service board would be no small 
achievement 
assuming the postal service board begins the process of raising 
rates for all classes of mail the independent postal rate 
commission will then ask for comment that should produce tons of 
reports and appeals from various interest groups and hold lengthy 
hearings before making its recommendation 
it will then be up to the postal service board to put the new 
rate into effect only once since the rate commission was created 
in 1971 has it proposed a lower increase than the board had asked 
for in that case the board overruled the recommendation and did 
what it had proposed 
while public attention focuses on the cost of sending a 
firstclass letter the real battles occur over second and 
thirdclass charges 
advertising firms charities and publishers of magazines and 
newspapers inundate the rate commission with pleas to hold down 
their portions of the overall rate hike 
although the postal service managed to post a 404 million 
surplus in the last three months of 1989 the agency expects a 
record 16 billion deficit for the fiscal year that will end sept 
30 the outcome of contract negotiations this summer could make the 
deficit even worse 
frank addressing postal costs in remarks late last month also 
noted that the postal service was required in the last two years 
to contribute 800 million to deficit reduction even though we 
dont use a penny of tax money and that health benefit costs 
are out of control a problem we share with the private sector 
franks comments came in a jan 25 speech to the economic club 
of indianapolis the postal service made a text of his remarks 
available thursday 
the postal service was separated from the federal government in 
1971 and tax subsidies were eliminated it was later returned to 
the federal budget at a time the agency was showing a surplus 
subsequently the postal service was taken back off the federal 
budget but was also required to cover some retirement and medical 
payments for employees of the old us post office department that 
expense has added millions of dollars to the services annual costs 
here is a rundown of the cost of mailing a firstclass letter 
since 1863 when the first flat rate was created at 2 cents per 
halfounce together with the average consumer price index for the 
year shown the cpi figures take the 19821984 average as 100 cpi 
figures are unavailable for years before 1947

a delaware court on tuesday upheld desoto incs 
poison pill takeover defense but chided the companys directors 
for failing to seek the best value for shareholders 
desoto officials declined comment on the chancery court ruling 
but new york investor william spier who is heading a hostile 
takeover bid for the des plaines illbased paintandchemical 
maker said the ruling left desoto with few choices 
desoto must now accept our 50 a share offer or provide 
greater value to its stockholders spier said in a statement 
issued by his takeover vehicle sutton holding corp 
the court ruled that desoto had not taken steps necessary to 
assure maximum shareholder value after rejecting suttons 300 
million offer in november 
desoto has been fending off sutton with a shareholder rights 
plan known as a poison pill that increases the number of 
outstanding shares thus making a takeover prohibitively expensive 
sutton had asked the delaware court to strike down the poison 
pill but the court upheld the takeover defense 
desoto also is seeking a buyer for its paint business the core 
of its operations desoto says it no longer wants to compete in the 
paint business but sutton contends the proposed sale is a 
desperation move designed to avoid a takeover 
last week sears roebuck and co said it was canceling its 
contract with desoto which has supplied paint to the retail giant 
for 80 years because of desotos decision to sell its paint 
operations

a pesticide plant that built public 
confidence by installing safeguards and promising full disclosures 
voided that trust by waiting three days to announce a leak of a 
chemical that had killed 3500 people in india a county official 
said tuesday 
kanawha county commissioners called rhonepoulenc managers to 
their offices to ask why fridays oneounce leak of methyl 
isocyanate wasnt disclosed until monday 
at tuesdays meeting the plants manager ron bearer 
apologized and said the unit that leaked would remain closed 
pending a safety review 
in the area of getting information to the public its very 
clear that we misjudged the situation bearer said to correct 
this situation in the future all releases of acutely toxic 
materials no matter how small will be communicated 
the mic unit had been shut down and fridays leak occurred 
during routine maintenance 
the occupational safety and health administration said it would 
investigate whether any laws were violated in the incident which 
injured seven 
weve worked from the county commissions end with the people 
at the plant to build up public confidence in the institute area 
county manager ron gregory said in one day with one ounce of 
mic they have destroyed that 
the letters mic cause fear among many in west virginias 
chemical valley a concentration of two dozen chemical plants along 
a 15mile stretch of the kanawha river the institute plant 10 
miles west of charleston is a former union carbide operation that 
contains the only true sister unit to a carbide operation at 
bhopal india 
a december 1984 leak at bhopal killed more than 3500 and 
injured tens of thousands more engineers retooled the institute 
mic unit afterward and installed millions of dollars worth of 
safeguards the plant was sold to rhonepoulenc in late 1986 
bearer named the plants manager just two weeks ago said 
monday the company didnt have to inform the county about fridays 
leak because it involved less than a pound of material none of 
which would have escaped the plant 
the chemical used in agricultural pesticides is so potent that 
the amount in fridays leak can injure eyes of workers 100 yards 
away 
federal regulations require disclosure only if the incident 
involves more than a pound of material or if there is a potential 
for health threats beyond the plant border 
gregory said that when the chemical is mic stricter rules must 
apply 
any situation where you dont tell the public whats 
happening the worst comes to mind gregory said they alarmed 
the public if they would have announced on friday that we had a 
oneounce leak of mic i dont think they would have had this 
problem 
gregory said the rhonepoulenc plant had three minor incidents 
friday full details of two were called in to emergency service 
personnel in charleston 
about the mic leak their planner did call the metro 911 
operation and said we have a problem with a little vapor 
escape gregory said two minutes later they called back and 
said all clear 
not once did they mention it was mic gregory said 
the seven workers injured were employed by a houston 
construction contractor the rhonepoulenc employees working on the 
mic unit werent injured bearer said 
paul pribyl manager for brown amp root construction said it is 
plant policy to notify personnel when potentially hazardous work is 
being done nearby for some reason it wasnt followed in this 
instance there was some sort of breakdown in communications he 
said 
in august 1985 union carbide officials waited 20 minutes to 
notify emergency officials about an aldicarb oxime and methylene 
chloride leak that injured 135 
union carbide said the bhopal leak occurred after saboteurs let 
water into an mic storage tank setting off a reaction the indian 
government accused carbide of shoddy workmanship the parties 
agreed to a 470 million settlement that a new indian government is 
seeking to void

the fall of the austral 
accelerated tuesday as argentinas currency plunged by 148 percent 
at the close of the business day argentines were paying 2500 
australs to buy one us dollar compared with 2130 australs on 
monday and 1990 last friday 
analysts said the decline stemmed from the printing of unbacked 
currency by the countrys central bank inflation soared by 40 
percent in december and is projected at 70 percent for january and 
february 
in part because the government failed to meet economic targets 
promised earlier an international monetary fund negotiating team 
decided to withhold disbursement of 230 million this month to 
argentina that sum would have been the second payment of a 14 
billion loan approved last october

an attorney for a dealer who was awarded 78 
million from toyotas american distributors says he is considering 
a classaction suit over the companies method of alloting cars to 
dealers 
i think this case will make a lot of dealers at least consider 
they might want to do something said james brandenburg quite 
frankly ive already had dealers contact me about a classaction 
suit on behalf of toyota dealers across the country 
a us district court jury made the award to pappas toyota of 
st charles friday pappas contended in the threeyearold suit 
that he was unfairly treated by toyota motor distribution and 
toyota motor sales both of torrance calif 
brandenburg said the jury found toyota had acted in bad faith 
between 1982 and 1987 in allocating cars and trucks to pappas 
resulting in lost sales for the dealer the key witness for pappas 
was a university of arizona faculty member who did a lengthy study 
of toyota distribution 
brandenburg said the socalled turn and earn system that 
required dealerships to earn new cars by selling the ones on their 
lots violated the contract between the dealer and the company 
which allowed the dealer to order whatever vehicles he desired 
jonathan ries an attorney for toyota said he was disappointed 
by the verdict and is considering filing an appeal he said toyota 
treated pappas fairly 
it was not the first time the issue has been tried in court 
brandenburg said he represented jim lynch toyota in 1986 when 
lynch won 2 million in a similar lawsuit 
the money awarded to pappas represented the amount that the 
dealership would have made had it been able to take delivery on 
more vehicles from 1982 through 1987 brandenburg said 
toyota has about 1000 dealers in the united states

the 1990s will be a banner economic decade for 
america despite a shaky beginning the president and deputy editor 
of forbes magazine predicted 
its going to be choppy in 1990 but after that we should have 
what could be one of the best decades of this century malcolm 
steve forbes jr said tuesday i think that by the years 
end the economy will start to pick up 
forbes in reno to promote a special nevada advertising section 
in his magazine said congress failure to cut the capital gains 
tax and instability in the value of the dollar are holding back an 
economic boom in the united states 
all of these things are reversible said forbes who has won 
four awards for economic forecasting from usx corp 
the key is the capital gains tax cut that needs to pass to 
get things going he said 
if we can avoid raising taxes bashing the dollar or getting 
into a trade war we should do well he added 
forbes a republican said people shouldnt worry about the 
federal budget deficit because it amounts to only about 2 percent 
of the countrys gross national product he also said the nations 
intractable trade deficit isnt a worry because it leads to growing 
foreign investment in this country 
people forget that for the first 100 years of this country 
there was a trade deficit forbes said
