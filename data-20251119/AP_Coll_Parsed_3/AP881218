grand metropolitan plc acquired the pillsbury 
co on sunday 2 months after the british conglomerate started its 
hostile takeover bid for the minneapolisbased food giant the two 
companies announced 
grand met agreed to purchase all outstanding shares of pillsbury 
common stock for 66 per share in cash 3 higher than grand mets 
most recent tender offer which was made last week the total deal 
is worth 568 billion 
the tender offer will expire at midnight jan 3 unless extended 
according to a statement issued by both companies 
pillsbury makes pillsbury flour green giant vegetables and a 
variety of other products and also owns the burger king 
benningans and steak amp ale restaurant chains the company has 
104000 employees during the fiscal year that ended may 31 the 
company had nearly 62 billion in revenues 
the us products and services under the grand met corporate 
umbrella include alpo pet foods pearle vision centres and jampb 
scotch among the british concerns run by the conglomerate are 
gambling casinos 
karl cambronne a lawyer for a group of dissident shareholders 
who sued to have pillsburys poison pill defense against 
takeovers invalidated called the buyout news just wonderful i 
think the shareholders did well 
just friday judges in two states issued key rulings that 
bolstered grand mets bid by weakening pillsburys antitakeover 
efforts 
on oct 3 the day before grand met launched its 60pershare 
bid pillsbury stock was trading at 39 per share on oct 4 after 
the bid was announced it rose to 57 on friday the stock closed 
at 62 
any shares not purchased in the tender offer will be acquired by 
grand met in a subsequent merger at the same 66pershare cash 
price according to the statement 
the boards of both companies approved the offer sunday the 
statement said 
the takeover of pillsbury giant comes less than a month after 
another giant of the industry rjr nabisco agreed to be taken over 
in a leveraged buyout the 25 billion deal was the largest in us 
corporate history 
the offer for pillsbury is conditioned upon a number of things 
among them that there be tendered a number of pillsbury shares that 
would represent at least a majority of the total fully diluted 
shares outstanding according to the statement 
as of the close of business on friday 61848918 of pillsbury 
common shares representing about 724 percent of the companys 
outstanding shares had been tendered to grand met and not withdrawn 
the pillsbury board determined that the terms of the offer and 
the merger were fair and in the best interests of pillsbury 
stockholders the statement said the board also recommended that 
pillsbury stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares 
we are pleased that we have succeeded in protecting the 
interests of our shareholders employees franchisees and 
communities and that we have reached a negotiated agreement that 
works to the advantage of everyone philip l smith chairman and 
chief executive officer of pillsbury said in a statement 
ian a martin chief executive of grand mets us operations 
said grand met officials also are pleased with the agreement 
pillsbury is the perfect fit to enable grand metropolitan to 
achieve its strategy of becoming a world leader in foods and 
retailing as well as the drinks sector martin said our 
company has the resources and expertise to grasp this opportunity 
pillsbury foods and burger king will play a vital role in helping us 
to realize these objectives 
the merger will greatly expand grand metropolitans established 
presence in the huge us marketplace while enabling us to open new 
business opportunities for pillsbury in global markets 
lawyers for pillsbury some of its shareholders and grand met met 
for nearly three hours saturday with a judge but all parties 
refused to comment on the closed meeting 
the meeting came the day after grand met won a major battle in 
its fight for pillsbury 
justice william duffy of the court of chancery in wilmington 
del said friday he would issue preliminary injunctions sought by 
grand met to invalidate pillsburys poison pill takeover defense 
and temporarily block the companys planned spinoff of burger king 
ruling in a separate lawsuit filed in minnesota by dissident 
pillsbury shareholders hennepin county district judge thomas carey 
on friday also temporarily blocked the burger king spinoff and said 
he probably would side with duffy on the poison pill issue 
grand met had asked for the pills removal so it could proceed 
with its tender offer which was 63 a share at that time

an unclassified small whale has been discovered 
in peru and scientists at washingtons smithsonian institute call 
it a new species government and newspaper reports said saturday 
the whale dubbed mesoplodon peruvianus belongs to a genus of 
beaked whales however it differs in its relatively short length of 
14 to 24 feet the government gazette el peruano said 
the mesoplodon peruvianus has characteristics similar to other 
small whales porpoises and dolphins the gazette quoted carlos del 
rio president of the peruvian national council of science and 
technology as saying he said the whale has never before been 
classified according to the report 
del rio said the scientific world was first alerted to the 
possibility of a new species when james g mead of the smithsonian 
institutes national museum of natural history discovered a skull 
fragment of the whale on a beach near lima in 1976 
mead was not available for comment saturday 
del rio said that since the initial find a few of the whales 
have been accidentially caught in fishermens nets or have washed up 
on pacific beaches in central peru however he said none has so far 
been seen alive in its natural habitat 
the weekly newspaper lima times reported that the smithsonian 
termed the whale a new species after studies of a carcass of an 
adult whale which had been found intact earlier this year 
the peruvian conservation group ecco which participated in the 
search and classification said scientists are still unsure why the 
species has not been spotted elsewhere ecco vice president tony 
luscombe of the united states said the whales may need the cold 
pacific currents that wash the shores of peru and chile

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrived 
sunday on the first stop of an asian tour which officials ope will 
pave the way for a japansoviet summit and ease tensions over a 
longstanding border dispute 
under a new atmosphere japansoviet relations are able to 
enter a new track of normal development shevardnadze told 
reporters after his aeroflot jet landed at tokyos haneda 
international airport this is something we have been waiting 
for 
substantial political dialogue between the two asian powers is 
overdue he said adding were trying to decide what to do 
shevardnadzes visit to japan the philippines and communist ally 
north korea comes as moscow courts capitalist asian nations with 
requests for economic cooperation and promises of military cutbacks 
in the region 
in the latest overture contained in a un address dec 7 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev pledged to reduce 
significantly our armed forces in the asian part of the country 
asian debtor nations including the philippines welcomed 
gorbachevs suggestion of a 100year moratorium on third world debt 
but asian and soviet officials say gorbachevs asian initiatives 
since his visit to the soviet pacific port of vladivostok on july 
28 1986 have produced few concrete payoffs 
soviet relations with china have improved recently but relations 
with most of the rest of asia remain stagnant or chilly crippling 
moscows efforts to expand trade and technology exchanges with 
industrialized asia 
theoretically moscow has much to offer an enormous potential 
market for asian goods scientific and technical aid and abundant 
natural resources 
in return asia could sell high technology and provide badly 
needed foreign investment 
during his fourday japan visit shevardnadze will meet with 
foreign minister sousuke uno for talks expected to include the 
dispute over sovietheld islands off japans northern hokkaido 
province 
both moscow and tokyo claim the southernmost section of the 
kurile chain but soviet troops ousted the 17000 japanese residents 
at the end of world war ii and have occupied the territory since 
the dispute has been the main obstacle preventing the two nations 
from signing a peace treaty to formally end wartime hostilities 
in downtown tokyo authorities tightened security around the 
soviet embassy where the foreign minister is staying busloads of 
police were seen on street corners near the walled compound a 
favorite target of rightwing groups demanding return of the islands 
japanese officials say they will also renew a 2yearold 
invitation for gorbachev to visit japan gorbachevs plans for a 
tokyo visit two years ago were postponed 
this time well have foreign ministerial sessions uno told 
the japan broadcasting corp but naturally id like to see a 
prime minister noboru takeshitagorbachev summit and i intend to 
bring up this subject during this round 
shevardnadze is expected to discuss japanese investment in 
siberia during his visit gorbachev has remarked that his plans to 
develop the vast soviet far east will require substantial input from 
japan 
this soviet need for advanced technology may have given japan 
leverage to negotiate over the disputed islands said ichiro 
suetsugu who heads the private council on national security 
problems 
japanese business and government officials say a major diplomatic 
breakthrough would help but not guarantee expanded economic ties 
they complain moscow lacks the hard currency needed to pay for 
hightechnology imports joint ventures are unprofitable and japan 
doesnt need more soviet timber or oil 
after his visit to tokyo shevardnadze will travel to the 
philippines and north korea his trip takes place as sovietbacked 
vietnam is withdrawing more troops from cambodia helping to ease 
tensions in the region 
shevardnadze is traveling to manila at his own initiative in what 
philippine officials call a get to know you visit he will be 
the highestranking soviet official to visit the former us colony 
since president corazon aquino assumed office in february 1986 
officials in australia and new zealand the biggest powers in the 
south pacific have said soviet economic penetration of the region 
could lead to a dangerous kremlin military presence

the aircraft was about 100 miles from the airport when the pilot 
noticed part of the wing was gone and requested clearance for the 
emergency return

heavy fog that halted air traffic at 
seattletacoma international airport and disrupted travel plans for 
thousands of passengers lifted saturday night allowing some flights

and some planes landed beginning about 8 pm treick said fog could 
create more delays overnight but the worst of it had passed 
abner thomas airport supervisor at seatac said late saturday 
afternoon that there were few planes on the ground because there was 
no traffic getting in minimum restrictions are not as severe for 
aircraft taking off as for planes that are landing so the airlines 
got their planes out of seattle when they could 
by midafternoon only two flights had been able to land because 
the fog restricted visibility below the minimum of 700 feet 
some incoming flights were diverted to moses lake portland 
ore and vancouver british columbia where the passengers were 
given the option of either getting to seattle by bus or waiting to

the man who was sworn in as the new 
prime minister of this island nation sunday was arrested hours later 
by security forces loyal to his ousted predecessor radio reports 
said 
barak sopes arrest fueled the dispute over who is in power in 
vanuatu a country of 130000 people about 1200 miles northeast of 
brisbane australia 
sope was sworn in sunday by president george sokomanu who on 
friday announced he was dissolving parliament and dismissing prime 
minister walter lini sope and lini who took office in 1980 have 
been locked in a power struggle for a year 
lini said he would not yield power and many in parliament 
questioned whether sokomanus actions were constitutional 
radio reports in sydney said that in addition to sope prolini 
troops arrested a cabinet minister whom lini fired earlier this year 
and his chauffeur and secretary 
the reports quoted sokomanu as saying the troops were in full 
combat gear some were carrying machine guns others had rifles 
earlier sunday sokomanu appointed a fivemember interim 
government which he said would rule vanuatu until national elections 
in february 
lini became prime minister in 1980 when vanuatu formerly the 
anglofrench new hebrides gained independence 
sokomanus decision to dismiss him and dissolve parliament 
followed byelections last week that gave linis governing vanuaku 
party twothirds control of the 46seat parliament 
the opposition boycotted the vote and sokomanu said the present 
parliament therefore was unconstitutional because no opposition 
candidates were put up for election 
sope told reporters he might seek military help from australia or 
other pacific states if vanuatus security forces refuse to support 
him 
australia has said it will continue to recognize lini as the 
legitimate prime minister

churchgoers put up roadblocks around the 
capital sunday to protest relaxation of a ban on sunday leisure 
activities causing traffic problems that led to cancellation of 
flights out of suvas airport 
also sunday prime minister ratu sir kamisese mara who led the 
country to independence from britain in 1970 was admitted to a 
hospital complaining of chest pains doctors said 
the roadblocks were dismantled after a personal appeal from the 
military chief sitiveni rabuka 
australian associated press said rabuka leader of two military 
coups last year made the appeal on national radio rabuka is a 
methodist like those who were protesting 
a spokesman for the demonstrators told radio fiji that methodists 
regard sunday as a day of rest and for the family not a day of 
work he said the action was meant as a display of faith 
an almost total ban on sunday activity including organized sport 
and beach parties was imposed soon after the second military coup 
as a result of strong lobbying by the methodist church which is 
dominated by indigenous fijians 
but since then a list of exemptions has grown 
families are now allowed to picnic as well as plant and harvest 
vital sugar cane crops resumption of limited sunday public 
transport apparently infuriated some worshipers 
church president josateki koroi said the protest did not have his 
blessing 
aap said several hundred methodists manned about 70 roadblocks 
that stopped cars and buses moving around the city and its outskirts 
stateowned radio fiji and privately run fm96 radio both 
reported that about a dozen roadblocks had been set up on suburban 
and city streets as well as the highway linking suva to its domestic 
airport forcing the cancellation of flights by domestic carrier 
fiji air 
a placard at one blockade read cars take a rest on sunday 
mara 68 whose defeat in elections last year led to rabukas 
first coup was admitted to the colonial war memorial hospital in 
suva he was feeling unwell but has now recovered a spokesman 
said he has elected to stay in hospital and undergo medical 
tests 
rabuka staged the south pacifics first military takeover on may 
14 1987 following the election of an indiandominated government 
headed by timoci bavadra who is fijian bavadra defeated mara who 
had served since 1970 
indians outnumber ethnic fijians among the 715000 population 
rabuka said his coup was aimed at protecting the political rights of 
ethnic fijians 
rabuka staged a second coup in september 1987 when an interim 
administration he had set up with mara as its leader began drafting 
a constitution that rabuka said did not protect ethnic rights 
rabuka reappointed mara again after the second coup

a kentucky company charged with polluting a stream near a 
national park claimed the chemical spill was caused by a sudden cold 
front that froze pipes the center provided statistics to help 
settle the question 
and a consultant for the automotive industry collected extensive 
temperature and precipitation data for cities across the country in 
an effort to determine areas with the most weatherinduced rust 
phone calls letters and electronic queries totaled some 73000 
requests for information during the past year said rex snodgrass of 
the data center 
nearly onethird of the requests come from lawyers snodgrass 
said in a telephone interview 
some records at the center go back to benjamin franklin and 
detailed data extend well into the last century said snodgrass 
simple questions are usually answered on the phone he said but 
customers who need something more have to pay for the research 
required regular customers set up accounts others can use checks 
or credit cards 
the data center publishes a variety of reports and pamphlets 
compiling information collected by the national weather service and 
its thousands of volunteer weather observers nationwide 
customers can get reports of hourly weather observations at 
hundreds of locations upper air weather measurements taken twice a 
day at many places radar observations satellite data hourly 
reports of radiation from the sun and a wide array of other 
information 
for example the popular television show hollywood squares 
decided to include questions about major us floods in its quizzes 
so researchers called the data center for information 
one freelance writer recently requested detailed weather 
information for the trenton nj area for oct 30 1938 the date 
and place of orson welles famous war of the worlds radio show 
about an invasion from mars 
another writer preparing a history of the last flight of amelia 
earhart requested weather data in order to help calculate fuel 
consumption of the missing airplane 
the drought last summer generated interest from news media and 
the public of course with many farmers seeking detailed rainfall 
records for their areas to support of drought insurance claims 
others in agriculture use the center too for example a 
california company choosing a location for a new strawberry farm 
requested freezefrost data for several northern california 
locations 
a florida farmer wants to expand his chinese cabbage farm but is 
looking for land in south carolina which is less costly if the 
climate will permit his crop to grow there 
a georgia tree farm is using temperature data to determine when 
the flathead apple borer will likely emerge and can be sprayed 
farmers battling the moisturesensitive southern pine beetle also 
have been using rainfall records from the center 
government data users include the navy which is compiling an 
atlas of weekly ice conditions in cold regions a senate committee 
studying the theory of greenhouse climate warming post office 
officials testing new mail sorting machines that may be sensitive to 
heat and even border patrol officials looking at how weather affects 
drug smugglers 
when needles and other used medical supplies began washing up on 
beaches this past summer the center assisted the new york 
department of environmental conservation by providing tide and wind 
data to help trace the source of the materials 
other requests during the past year included temperature and 
snowfall data for a developer considering building a ski resort in 
the smokey mountains wind information for planners of a regatta in 
florida visibility data for a company that wants to build a tall 
building near the cleveland airport and rainfall information for an 
audubon society project studying acid rain

president reagan said the voters gave george 
bush a mandate to continue the reagan administration policies but 
bush appears likely to change course on some key issues both 
critics and supporters say 
i think fiscally circumstances will dictate that he has no 
choice but to be if anything a little more conservative than 
reagan in other areas he could be substantially more moderate 
says iowas republican rep jim leach who supported bush for the 
gop presidential nomination 
it is obvious that he will not permit central america or 
nicaragua to become the centerpiece of his foreign policy as reagan 
did says lawrence birns director of the council on hemispheric 
affairs a organization often critical of the administration 
you are not going to hear from him the same kind of fierce 
rhetoric about limited government that you have heard the last eight 
years says me bradford a professor of english at the 
university of dallas and a writer on southern conservatism the 
sharp edge is going to be off a lot of things 
there are other hints that winds of change may be blowing despite 
the muchheralded continuity of the vice presidents succession to 
the presidency by election for the first time in 150 years 
as his national security adviser bush has chosen brent 
scowcroft whose views have often differed from those of the reagan 
administration scowcroft supported the singlewarhead mobile 
midgetman when the pentagon wanted to scrap the missile and deploy 
the 10warhead mx on rail cars instead 
and in testimony last year scowcroft called the administrations 
broad interpretation of the antiballistic missile treaty a 
translation designed to ease the way for tests of the star wars 
space defense system unbefitting 
black civil rights activist jesse jackson met with bush nov 30 
and said he was able to discuss matters with him that he had never 
been able to raise with reagan he said they talked about 
antisemitism and racism among other subjects 
the same day bush met with environmental leaders one of whom 
jay d hair president of the national wildlife federation said the 
difference between the president and the presidentelect was like 
night and day although bush made no specific commitments major 
environmental groups opposed bush during the campaign but he 
repeatedly called himself an environmentalist something reagan 
seldom does 
in eastwest relations reagan has consistently framed the basic 
conflict with the soviets in moral terms the presidentelect speaks 
more often in terms of great power competition it was reagan not 
bush who used to call the soviet union the evil empire 
in the campaign bush like reagan promised to pick judges who 
would interpret the law not make it he departed from anything 
reagan ever said however in also promising there would be no 
ideological litmus test for judicial nominations 
with all of this there are still more similarities than 
differences in their views judging from their own statements and 
those of others 
george bush has gotten his mandate from the american people 
the mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and 
prosperity reagan said four days after the election 
most insistently bush has restated the key pledge on which 
reagan stood for eight years no new taxes 
for the foreseeable future i think the people who are looking 
for him to change his mind about that are very foolish said the 
conservative scholar bradford 
leach however said that circumstances and compromises could 
mean some movement on this issue although bush will without 
doubt be much more disinclined to look at the tax structure 
than his democratic critics 
bradford and the hemispheric affairs councils birns agreed that 
in dealing with the sandinista government of nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega bush would seek a solution more acceptable to 
democrats in congress than the allout military aid for the contra 
rebels that reagan has favored 
i dont think the contras will be abandoned said bradford 
but i think he will try very hard to bring a lot of democrats with 
him 
i think his instincts are the same as reagans the texas 
professor added he would like to blow ortega out of the tub 
we know that bush is a cowboy on the subject of nicaragua 
said birns but it just doesnt make sense that he is going to 
strap himself to a policy that has failed 
house speaker jim wright dtexas a foe of contra aid said 
after a postelection meeting with bush that he was encouraged to 
believe that there is a search for a policy that will be 
acceptable both to the presidentelect and congress 
on the middle east many experts contend that the palestinian 
uprising and other developments make the time ripe for more active 
american diplomacy sol linowitz who was sent to the region as a 
special envoy by president carter has suggested that bush promptly 
name another such emissary 
bush aides have said it is too early to make such a decision 
since the new administrations middle eastern policy is still being 
formulated 
reagan last week authorized a substantive dialogue between 
the united states and the palestine liberation organization bush 
said he supported the decision 
i think bush will be committed to the future of israel leach 
said he also i think recognizes it is unwise not to listen to 
all sides i think youll see someone in the white house who 
understands more of the subtleties of the middle east than weve had 
in recent years 
bush traveled to israel egypt and jordan in 1986 in a trip 
billed at the time as a mission to spur the peace process 
on other issues leach said i look for progressive arms 
control i look for a much more effective and principled use of 
international organizations like the united nations he set a little 
more moderate agenda in the environment in education in day care

the winter solstice is nearly upon us again an 
event long celebrated as marking the triumph of the unconquered sun 
but today more often dreaded as the start of winter 
overshadowed in this season of religious holidays and the 
approaching new year the solstice was once the most popular of 
pagan celebrations 
it marks the lowest point of the year for the suns apparent 
travel occurring at 1028 am est on dec 21 according to the 
us naval observatory 
after the solstice the sun begins spreading its warming rays 
farther and farther north until reaching a zenith at the summer 
solstice in june 
primitive societies fearing the suns departure often developed 
complex folk tales about the change in seasons and learned to 
celebrate the winter solstice as a time of rebirth foreshadowing the 
coming return of summer 
indeed sociologists note that many aspects of this event were 
incorporated into christian festivities marking the birth of jesus 
which is now a major event of this season 
to residents of ancient rome the season was known as saturnalia 
and was celebrated with raucous merrymaking that has since been 
generally toned down or at least postponed until new years eve 
the germanic tradition called yule remains popular in many areas 
however that feast incorporated burning of a special yule log 
decorating with plants such as holly ivy and mistletoe which were 
thought magical and drinking wassail toasts 
gail cleere of the naval observatory reports that great bonfires 
were lit atop hills in hopes of encouraging the return of the sun 
today most calendars list this date as the start of winter 
despite the fact that there are no official definitions of the 
seasons 
meteorologists for example consider winter to begin dec 1 in 
medieval times nov 23 was considered that seasons beginning and 
most people simply judge winters arrival by how cold they feel when 
they go outdoors 
at any rate the coming months mark the coldest time of the year 
thanks to the fact that although the sunlight is gradually 
increasing it takes some time to overcome the cooling that has been 
underway during autumn when the light was on the decline 
that thermal lag notwithstanding spring will come to be 
welcomed by those following medieval tradition on feb 22 by 
meteorologists on march 1 by calendar makers on march 20 and by 
most folks on the first balmy day

climbers who set out to scale the cliffs at a new 
gorilla exhibit in the franklin park zoo were trying to prove it 
couldnt be done 
but they did it despite a lack of places to grip and a tough 
overhang 
officials at the 26 million african tropical forest exhibit said 
they wanted to establish that the zoos gorillas would be unable to 
reach the peak of the cliffs and thereby gain access to the public 
area of the innovative animal display 
the gorilla has shorter legs and longer arms and hes much 
stronger said project manager walter kilroy of the metropolitan 
district commission which operates the zoo 
this is a fairly strong test of the rocks he added 
because gorillas cant really problemsolve the way humans can 
climber richard doucette said he had had a tough time reaching 
the exhibit summit the rocks lack features places to grip and 
the overhang is what kills you he said 
zoo officials said some niches would be filled in to prevent 
climbers human and primate from gaining a grip 
the exhibit scheduled to open in september 1989 was designed to 
portray animals in their environment rather than in cages executive 
director mark goldstein said 
you and i grew up with zoos where the elephants were in one 
cage and the lions were in the next cage we learned about animals 
in these cubby holes he said but instead of this being a 
species building or a noahs ark you will be experiencing a piece 
of an african forest 
in addition to gorillas the statefunded complex includes plenty 
of tropical vegetation streams and waterfalls 25 species of birds 
fish leopards insects crocodiles and antelope

seventeenyearold arnel galang still 
wakes up screaming haunted by the faces of the 23 relatives he lost 
a year ago when the ferry dona paz sank with more than 3000 people 
aboard 
arnel then a high school senior was one of only 26 passengers 
and crew who survived after the 2215ton dona paz collided with the 
629ton oil tanker vector and exploded off mindoro island the night 
of dec 20 1987 
a presidential commission said at least 3563 people were aboard 
the two ships but the precise figure may never be known only 108 
bodies were recovered after the disaster which the coast guard 
blamed on the vector 
for arnel the year has been one of bitterness and pain he feels 
abandoned by a government that he says has done little to help him 
family members blame arnel for not saving his relatives 
including cousins aunts and an infant niece who perished on the 
dona paz 
everything that happened is still clear to me he said his 
hands trembling sometimes i cant sleep sometimes i get 
nightmares i shout and cry then i stay awake all night in my 
dreams they tell me they have not died only wandered off to an 
unknown place but i have to face reality i just pray for them 
arnel and his relatives boarded the dona paz to go to manila to 
visit his sister rose whom he hadnt seen since childhood it was 
his first time on a ship 
suddenly about 10 pm he felt a strong thud 
he ran for a wall and squeezed himself through a porthole 
i struggled free and fell into the water he recalled i 
couldnt hear anything anymore there was just silence the sea was 
on fire my face was scalded the water was very hot as if it were 
boiling water i swam so fast i dont know how i did it 
arnel and the other survivors were rescued by a passing ship and 
brought to manila there he saw rose burned and bandaged he raced 
to embrace her 
but the joy of reunion soon gave way to resentment relatives 
blamed him for not saving other family members 
they ask me arnel why did you not save your cousins he 
said fighting back tears i tell themthere was nothing i could 
do it was difficult enough saving myself maybe if i tried to save 
them we would all have died 
since the disaster arnel said he has shunned other relatives 
including his parents who live in manila 
arnel is also bitter at the government which he says abandoned 
him he received 5000 pesos or 250 which president corazon 
aquino allocated for each survivor but he said there has been no 
psychological counseling or rehabilitation for the survivors 
mrs aquino recommended arnel for a job in a pharmacy but the 
company refused to hire him his family is too poor to afford fees 
to complete his final year of high school he works as an unpaid 
volunteer for an association of relatives of dona paz victims and 
survives on charity 
arnel said he and some relatives of victims have refused to 
accept a 1500 lump sum payment from the shipowners sulpicio 
shipping lines because the company insists they sign a waiver 
promising no further claims 
in april a group of survivors and relatives filed a class action 
suit seeking more compensation the case was dismissed and an appeal 
is pending before the supreme court 
in the meantime arnel is considering becoming a priest 
when i think about the things ive gone through and am going 
through i think that maybe god wants me to be a priest and serve 
him he said at this point i have nothing else to lose and i 
am ready to offer my life 
the sense of loneliness and abandonment is all the more painful 
at christmas 
last christmas five days after the tragedy arnel spent the day 
crying in a corner of his parents home gazing out the window this 
year he plans to spend the holiday alone 
i cant bear to face them again he said

sales of timber from governmentowned forests 
make money for the government overall although most forests lose 
money according to a new forest service study 
the study required by congress because of years of disputes over 
whether the sales in effect amount to government subsidies for 
timber companies was immediately attacked by a chief critic of the 
sales who said the study would have found overall losses if proper 
accounting practices were used 
the current report covers the fiscal year ending sept 30 1987 
and will be used to compile an updated version for the following 
year and then a formal report to congress for the current year 
in a preface of the report addressed to dear national forest 
user forest service chief dale robertson said receipts from 
timber sales in fiscal 1987 exceeded costs by 540 million 
roughly half that sum has to be returned to state and local 
governments leaving the federal government 267 million ahead from 
the sales the service said 
the wilderness society however said in a statement the new 
system greatly understates the costs of selling timber thus 
overstating any profits the society said it believed proper 
accounting would show a fiscal 1987 loss of 223 million and average 
annual losses of 406 million from 1982 though 1987 
the forest service study showed a pattern of frequent moderate 
losses offset by large gains notably from the productive forests of 
the pacific northwest 
the forest service region of oregon and washington accounted for 
460 million of the receipts over expenditures 85 percent of the 
total gain of 540 million put another way washingtonoregon had 
264 in revenue for every dollar of expense while the system as a 
whole had 176 
past studies have shown similar dominance by the pacific 
northwest a 1984 study by the general accounting office covering a 
period when timber prices were lower said the pacific northwest 
gains outweighed losses in all the remaining regions of the system 
in the study gains were reported in three other regions 
arizona and new mexico 152 in revenue per dollar of cost 
california 207 per dollar and the southeast a region that 
includes texas and oklahoma 162 
all other regions lost money montana north dakota and northern 
idaho 88 cents of revenue per dollar expense rocky mountains 
eastern and central wyoming colorado south dakota nebraska and 
kansas 56 cents western wyoming southern idaho utah and nevada 
57 cents minnesota iowa missouri and states to the east north of 
the ohio and potomac rivers including west virginia 87 cents 
alaska 25 cents 
the harvest of 127 billion board feet of timber generated more 
than 139000 jobs in affected communities and 383 billion in 
income including rents and returns on investments the service said 
the timber sales also produce other benefits that cannot be 
assigned monetary values including sustained yields of various 
wildlife habitat to support a variety of species reduced forest 
protection costs reduced probability of catastrophic fires 
increased visual diversity and watershed improvements 
the wilderness society statement said 76 of 120 forests lost 
money in part because the service assigns too little cost to 
roadbuilding 
one bookkeeping trick that the forest service uses is to 
amortize the costs of roads and bridges over the entire interval 
between timber harvests for example in the rocky mountains road 
costs are spread out over a period ranging from 122 to 331 years 
this means only a tiny fraction of roadbuilding costs are 
charged against timber receipts in a given year while private 
companies would recover those costs in 20 to 30 years

when it comes to holiday giving every town has its santas and 
scrooges but some communities seem to have an abundance of one or 
the other this year 
with a week to go before christmas charities are reporting mixed 
results donations are up or holding their own in some places and 
down in others according to checks with the salvation army the 
united way catholic charities the red cross food banks and other 
groups 
efforts to aid the victims of the earthquake in soviet armenia 
appear to be having an impact on domestic giving in some cities the 
charities say 
there seems to be no pattern collections are up in big cities 
like new york and chicago but down in los angeles in the midwest 
kansas city and st louis reported healthy donations while oklahoma 
city was having a more difficult time 
nor was a strong economy necessarily a sign of success donations 
were up in boston but those in neighboring rhode island were 
struggling to stay even 
local factors account for some of these differences such as 
shopping malls that ban salvation army kettles others have to do 
with the weather competition among charities the local economy a 
shortage of bell ringers and a shift of donations earlier this year 
into campaign coffers 
charity officials in boston credit their success to a more 
sophisticated approach to hatpassing as well as seasonal good will 
there seemed a tendency to give more and we also broadened our 
base by going to more people a lot of people dont give because 
they havent been asked said wallinda hudson spokeswoman for the 
united way of massachusetts bay which raised 487 million in 
pledges for its 1988 campaign up 10 percent over 1987 
its a different story in arizona where charities say an 
economic downturn is behind a decline in giving paul curnow the 
salvation armys development director in phoenix cites a 12 percent 
to 25 percent drop 
the story is much the same in detroit and newark nj giving is 
down by at least 60000 from last year for the salvation army in 
detroit thelma cloude director of the greater newark social 
services and correction bureau said this year with the 
upsurgence of the working poor those who used to help us now need 
help themselves 
other areas are suffering from a dearth of volunteer or lowpaid 
donationcollectors ironically a result of a strengthening economy 
that has more people working charity officials say 
in rhode island which has an unemployment rate of 3 percent the 
salvation army corps of providence is hurriedly trying to recruit 
volunteers said capt john e wettlaufer for a fulltimer we 
have one woman that works every day and shes 86 years old god 
bless her he said college students have pitched in on weekends 
in georgia with more volunteer bell ringers than ever salvation 
army officials said kettle donations are up by 15 percent however 
mail donations are off by 6 percent 
for fundraisers in southern california the campaign drain has 
been the problem 
the fact of the matter is that we usually suffer every four 
years when theres an election said russell prince the salvation 
army development director in southern california where donations 
are running 15 percent behind last year 
in richmond va salvation army officials blame a drop at the 
kettles on cold weather and shopping mall managers who barred the 
bellringers 
americans response to the armenian earthquake was viewed as 
having an impact on domestic giving in some cities such as detroit 
people that give to that armenia seem to dig a little deeper 
it hasnt affected our income said don payton director of 
development for the salvation army in denver who estimated that 
donations were running 6 percent to 8 percent above 1987 
the red cross southeast michigan chapter faces a bittersweet 
situation spokesman mark cornillie said 
a lot of people are converting their gifts to armenia and in 
that case we absorb the cost of handling that money so not only 
are we losing money that people traditionally give to us at this 
time of year but were losing it in the administration end he 
said 
meanwhile the need for assistance keeps growing spokesmen say 
a program to provide toys coats and food for needy families in the 
newark nj area had 1600 families request aid this year double 
last years total said ms cloude 
while the amount of goods donated to the south central 
pennsylvania foodbank in suburban harrisburg is about the same as 
last year the demand for food from its 300 participating agencies 
has increased said assistant director jodie morris 
but officials retain faith in americans willingness to respond 
to need when people see people in need and they see an 
opportunity to help they will said national red cross 
spokeswoman barbara lohman

presidentelect bush entering the white house 
on the heels of an administration bedeviled by ethics accusations 
against senior personnel plans to move quickly on his own ethics 
bill early next year aides say 
although bush supported president reagans pocket veto of ethics 
legislation that congress passed this year he intends to put forth 
a package that will include some of the same elements said the 
presidentelects legal counsel boyden gray 
weve already started very preliminarily to put our thoughts 
together on it the anticipation is that we will have a bill late 
this winter early spring gray said in an interview 
during the campaign bush walked a careful line to avoid direct 
criticism of former attorney general edwin meese iii who was under 
investigation by an independent counsel while trying to signal that 
his own administration would hew to high ethical standards 
independent counsel james mckay later declined to prosecute 
meese but concluded that the former attorney general probably broke 
federal conflictofinterest laws twice by handling matters 
affecting the telecommunications industry at the time he held 
telephone stock 
in a news conference last week bush promised to carry through on 
his campaign pledge saying i will have ethics legislation i 
spoke about it in the campaign my commitment to high ethical 
standards and i will have proposed legislation go up very very 
early 
gray said drafting has not begun he has not specifically 
discussed proposed ethics legislation with the justice department 
yet but said his staff has held preliminary talks with 
representatives from the office of government ethics 
gray said bush intends to include some planks that were not in 
the legislation reagan vetoed last month including applying the 
same restrictions to members of congress as those that apply to 
executive branch employees who leave government 
the congressional legislation only banned lobbying activity for 
one year for people who left congress but imposed a lifetime ban in 
some circumstances for executive branch employees bush has 
supported a oneyear ban on congressional lobbying by former members 
of congress 
the complaint of the reagan administration in which bush serves 
as vice president was that the 1988 congressional bill imposed far 
more restrictive rules on executive branch employees 
in vetoing the bill reagan said he considered it excessive and 
discriminatory and said it would hamper good people from entering 
the government 
administration officials criticized the bill because it forbade 
former executive branch employees not only from lobbying their 
former division but also aiding or advising clients on dealings with 
that division 
that aiding and advising clause which was a lifetime ban will 
be left on the cutting room floor of the bush proposal gray said 
more than 100 officials in the reagan administration have been 
accused of wrongdoing and at least six including former deputy 
chief of staff michael k deaver and lyn nofziger reagans former 
political director have been convicted 
bush has promised to set up a white house ethics office with a 
permanent ethics office in each government department and agency 
during his campaign he pledged greater discretion for 
prosecutors in pursuing civil and criminal sanctions depending on 
the gravity of the case against those who violate 
conflictofinterest standards 
he also said all blind trusts for government officials should be 
managed by institutions rather than individuals 
gray said bush also would consider the white house as one entity 
for purposes of postemployment lobbying restrictions rather than 
precluding people from lobbying only the section of the executive 
branch where they worked 
the compartmentalization of the executive office of the 
president i think is something the vice president thinks is 
somewhat artificial and ought to go gray said because they 
interact on such a daily basis 
in other words a person would be barred from lobbying not only 
the part of the white house where he or she worked such as the 
office of management and budget national security council or office 
of the vice president but would be restricted in contacts from all 
white house sections 
gray said he also will try to push bushs proposal for some 
regulation on influence that people may wield before they leave 
office that could affect their postgovernment careers 
the revolving door tends to focus almost exclusively on what 
people can do after they leave he said 
but people can still make decisions involving companies that 
might hire them after they leave government such postgovernment 
employment would not necessarily involve lobbying their former 
government agency but in these cases theyve already done it 
gray said 
i think its a problem in the pentagon i think its a problem 
in every department to a greater or lesser degree people 
feathering their nest he said 
gray said he has not yet sat down with justice department or 
office of government ethics officials to determine how regulations 
to deal with that aspect might be worked out

the grand prize was handcuffs and an 
allexpensespaid trip to the county jail in a bogus radiostation 
promotion that netted 39 unsuspecting fugitives police said sunday 
it went beautifully springfield police commander dave searcy 
said a day after the sting operation lured the suspects to what 
they thought was a holiday extravaganza arranged by radio station 
wbtp 
but the call letters stood for wanted by the police and 
those who showed up were arrested instead on charges ranging from 
traffic offenses to burglary 
they were allowed to party for a halfhour with drinks and 
everything searcy said but everybody there from santa claus 
to the elves to the clowns were cops in some cases we were 
entertaining their kids while other cops were booking them 
promotional letters from the phony radio station were sent to the 
last known address authorities had for 545 fugitives in a 
threecounty area around springfield the scheme was hatched by the 
sangamon county sheriffs police several weeks earlier 
recipients of the letters were promised a 500 gift certificate 
and a chance to win a 2000 shopping spree at area stores in a 
drawing scheduled for saturday morning at the prairie capitol 
convention center 
but to claim the prizes winners had to show up in person at what 
was billed as a holiday promotion at the center 
we took them out one by one to get their surprises searcy 
said and they were surprised all right 
one woman kept laughing and saying youre not serious when 
we told her we were she started crying another guy kept saying i 
knew it i just knew it but that didnt stop him from showing up 
of the 39 arrests 12 were for felony charges 25 for 
misdemeanors and two for traffic offenses one fugitive arrested 
had been sought since 1984 searcy said 
about half had posted bond by midday sunday he added 
we had only one minor snag a man with the same name as his son 
showed up the mistake was found out right away searcy said 
but needless to say he was more than a little upset by the whole 
thing

sunday he was confident moscow is ready to abandon its communist 
protege in kabul president najib 
i believe the russians know their puppet regime cant stay 
burhanuddin rabbani chairman of the sevenparty afghan guerrilla 
alliance told a news conference 
they the soviets dont want the present regime to be there 
he said referring to najib and his ruling marxist peoples 
democratic party of afghansitan

soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov dec 35 in the saudi 
arabian resort city of taif he said that at that meeting vorontsov 
told guerrillas we want a new system a new situation 
vorontsov and the guerrillas are expected to return to the 
negotiating table in islamabad before the end of the month rebel 
and pakistani sources said 
on saturday a lowlevel soviet delegation met with afghan 
guerrillas but the guerrillas said the talks concerned only 
prisoner exchanges and ended without agreement 
the soviet union intervened in afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the 
marxist government last april the kremlin agreed to pull half of 
its estimated 100000 troops out by aug 15 and the rest by next

rabbani said the guerrillas have demanded removal of the ruling 
communists reparation money an end to moscows weapons aid to 
kabul and recognition of a government framed by the rebels 
if the soviets prove they share a commitment to peace rabbani 
said then the guerrillas will guarantee red army troops safe 
passage out of the country 
the mujahedeen will not create any obstacles on their way out 
provided the soviets give them advance knowledge of departing 
troops rabbani said 
the sevenparty alliance has scheduled a meeting monday to review 
the taif talks and hammer out a broadbased council that could 
step into the breach in kabul should the ruling communists abandon 
the capital rabbani said 
the council he said would include representation from different 
segments of afghan society with the exception of the kabul 
communists however the alliance has not agreed whether it would be 
established through elections or by appointment he said

a city employee trying to lighten up city hall 
found out that her boss didnt appreciate her sense of humor 
water system clerk betty murphy was fired after she placed a sign 
asking residents if they wanted to speak to the man in charge or 
to the woman who knows whats going on 
mayor sharooz jamie said he discharged murphy who is also the 
elected city recorder because he didnt think funny signs belonged 
on the walls of city hall 
murphy said jamie never complained about the signs until recently 
people bring them in and i put them up she said last week 
ive done it ever since i was elected last year 
murphy said she continued to put up notes on the front door of 
city hall after she lost her job dec 6 and was locked out of the 
building she said jamie tore down one note saying she would be back 
for her belongings leading her to put up another note that said 
i shall return 
city hall is not a joking place jamie said she must think 
shes general douglas macarthur 
the recorder who supervises city finances has no office in city 
hall 
jamie and murphy have often disagreed on city business including 
murphys initiative to remove a speed bump from a back street while 
jamie was out of town she said the noise from cars was bothering an 
elderly man who lived on the hill above it 
murphy has filed a lawsuit in clay county circuit court to 
determine whether she can be fired as water clerk

have any problem with working with her jamie said

south african soldiers hiding 
out in what they believed was a guerrilla safe house shot and killed 
two black policemen and an alleged informer who approached the 
building police said sunday 
the victims also believed the building was a base for the 
outlawed african national congress and were arriving to investigate 
police said 
the ambush in the soweto township occurred on wednesday but was 
not reported by police or the army until sunday newspapers described 
it 
police refused to say if weapons were found in the house or 
identify the owner the sunday times quoted a neighbor richard 
gondolwane as saying i didnt know my neighbors well as they had 
only lived there for a short time 
after being tipped off by an unidentified informant soldiers hid 
inside the house wednesday according to the reports 
about the same time four policemen three black and one white 
were told by the alleged informer that the house was occupied by anc 
members police said they went to investigate and were shot as they 
approached the house at night according to police headquarters 
the sunday times reported that they victims were fired upon after 
they broke down the door of the darkened home and burst inside 
the soldiers believing they were firing at anc members killed 
two black policemen and the alleged informer and injured the third 
black policeman the white officer was not hurt police said 
the policy of having white south african soldiers on duty in the 
black townships is a controversial one 
antiapartheid organizations have made removal of the soldiers a 
major demand and the situation has been an issue in trials of draft 
resisters who say it is inappropriate for white soldiers to be 
called to perform military service in neighborhoods where their 
fellow black citizens live 
it was not clear whether the soldiers involved in the shooting 
were career officers or young draftees performing their mandatory 
two years of service 
if the soldiers were national servicemen it was extremely 
reckless to use young men who obviously have not had the training 
for action of this sort said helen suzman a parliament member 
from the antiapartheid progressive federal party 
this is another good reason for not sending the army into the 
townships and for only using men who are properly trained 
under apartheid blacks have no vote in national affairs and have 
separate districts and schools from whites who control the economy

during the month of december mistletoe 
postmaster ab couch said he handles twice as much mail as he does 
all the rest of the year 
they send it here to get the mistletoe postmark on it 
couch said i dont count the mail but i suppose about 500 pieces 
came in this morning 
the mail arrives by the only route to the tiny post office a 
twisting sixmile gravel road 
the story goes that the post office got its name because trees 
on the surrounding hills were full of mistletoe said couch the 
postmaster since 1969 that bad winter of 1977 about wiped it out 
though 
there isnt much in mistletoe besides an abandoned presbyterian 
church some barns and couchs woodframe house 
inside the house the kitchen is to the right the us post 
office to the left 
until december couch and his assistant postmaster his wife of 
22 years judy process about 2300 pieces of mail for the 16 
customers tucked among the owsley county hills 
but in december mail from all over the country and several 
foreign nations arrives at the post office addressed to him 
inside couch finds addressed stamped envelopes onto which he 
stamps the coveted postmark and then mails the finished products 
back out 
couch said he doesnt keep track of who sends what so hes not 
sure whether he has customers who mail to mistletoe year after year

public lawn disturbing the flow of traffic and failing to follow 
police instructions police told him he would not be charged with

while they were having their pictures taken with him 
police said donald strong 44 of crawfordsville was charged 
thursday with sexual battery after he allegedly fondled the young 
women aged 15 16 17 and 18 at boulevard mall 
mall manager kevin b garleb said strong has previous convictions 
on burlgary and theft charges he would not comment on the sexual 
battery charges but defended his hiring of strong 
past charges of burglary do not mean that you would be a 
possible threat for a sexual crime garleb said 
detective lt rick d wilson said strong was arrested while he 
was off duty 
the young women did not report the alleged fondlings but a 
policeman overheard other shoppers talking about the allegations 
i think there were several reasons why they did not report the 
incidents immediately like victims of other sexual crimes they 
were afraid of the embarrassment and publicity wilson said

truly compete for the world title 
so says mayor jack murray if you cant beat em join em 
murray hopes to set up a sistercity relationship with the 
siberian village of verkhoyansk which according to a history of 
the region has recorded temperatures as low as 90 degrees below

publicity to go with things were doing here said murray whose 
city is trying to further promote itself as a coldweather testing 
site for products ranging from clothing to car batteries 
thats even though its record low is a mere 46 degrees below zero

freed hostage peter winkler returning home sunday 
said he has a greater desire to be a relief worker despite his 
abduction while working in lebanon and month in captivity 
the red cross delegate told reporters in geneva that he spent 
much of his days thinking about my life my work for the red 
cross which i would like to continue but i fear it will not be 
again in lebanon 
but he said he was even more motivated now to work for the red 
cross 
winkler 32 said his captors never identified themselves or told 
him why they kidnapped him nov 17 in the city of sidon where he 
directed operations for the international committee of the red cross 
winkler freed friday in sidon said he was treated well but was 
very much afraid 
the former hostage smiled when he stepped down from a cyprus 
airways plane in geneva before continuing to germanspeaking 
switzerland to meet his parents 
i went through moments of crisis which i have never gone 
through before and which i hope i will never go through again he 
told reporters he declined to elaborate saying its too 
personal 
winkler said he did not know whether his release might mean that 
other hostages also would be freed 
swiss foreign minister rene felber said saturday that winklers 
abductors tried to make his release conditional on a lenient 
sentence for a jailed lebanese shiite moslem hijacker held in 
switzerland which refused to make any concessions 
hussein hariri 22 hijacked an air afrique plane to geneva july 
14 1987 and killed a french passenger before he was subdued and 
arrested he is to go on trial feb 20 and faces a maximum sentence 
of life in prison if convicted 
winkler said his captors dictated word for word his 
handwritten note early this month it said in english my 
government knows what my kidnappers want from it and it has to 
cooperate in order to save my life 
the swiss foreign minister said the kidnappers identified 
themselves as members of a dissident palestinian group calling 
itself the organization of socialist revolution 
winkler said he was kept in solitary confinement but did not 
know where he said he never saw the faces of his captors who were 
either masked or blindfolded 
during the captivity he was able to listen to news broadcasts by 
the british broadcasting corp and radio monte carlo winkler said 
he also had a bible and four english and frenchlanguage books 
including marcel pagnols the time of secrecy 
i did not manage to finish it he added laughing 
red cross spokesman carlos bauverd said its policy was never to 
send a delegate back to a region where he or she had a problem 
winkler was the first international red cross delegate to be taken 
hostage 
bauverd said the red cross would probably resume operations 
in south lebanon which were stopped after winklers abduction he 
said the staff which had been cut from 27 to 17 likely would be 
increased

dogs trained to search for bodies their 12 handlers and five 
doctors 
tamillow said he was amazed at the resilience of the armenian 
people and credited soviet troops with helping rescue workers from 
the united states and other countries 
the true heroes are the armenian people said tamillow a 
firefighter from fairfax va 
tamillow said subfreezing weather tested the mettle of the relief 
workers 
we were literally camping out over there in 20degree 
weather he said we were running low on water and we had no 
firewood 
tamillow said soviet troops would visit the american base camp 
nightly and bring firewood soviets and americans often exchanged 
stories and souvenirs he said we would give them candy and they 
would give us things he said 
tamillow was part of a team that assembled dec 9 two days after 
the earthquake at the request of the office of foreign assistance 
an arm of the agency for international development 
one of the returning doctors claude cadoux of chevy chase md 
said the physicians set up a makeshift hospital at an airport where 
there also was a base camp for relief workers 
the facility was designed to support the rescue operation but 
also treated survivors of the earthquake which killed an estimated 
55000 people and left an estimated 500000 homeless 
once the people learned we were there they came to us for care 
because of the overburden of facilities in the region cadoux said 
dr vartkes najarian an armenianamerican from glendale calif 
said residents of the earthquakeravaged area were grateful for the 
assistance of the dogs in searching through the rubble for survivors 
and bodies 
they started kissing and hugging the dogs and then they went 
into their homes to bring food najarian said 
about 30 armenianamericans from the washington area were at the 
base when the team returned and presented its members with gifts 
family members and coworkers also were on hand for the arrival 
earlier sunday an aeroflot flight carrying 20 kidney dialysis

president alan garcia offered his resignation 
as top leader of the governing party after he received a bitter 
reception at his partys national convention officials said sunday 
garcia perus president since july 1985 submitted a letter 
placing his post as president of the aprista party at the 
disposition of the party aprista said in a statement 
party official ferdando leon de vivero issued a statement sunday 
afternoon saying the party would keep garcia at its helm and that 
party directors backed garcia fully 
in garcias letter published in lima newspapers sunday he said 
i am no longer a man of triumph i am an aprista upon whom all the 
insults fall without desiring it others at my side can be hurt 
critics accuse garcia of implementing policies that have brought 
on perus worst economic crisis this century and have failed to stop 
the leftist shining path movement whose eightyear guerrilla war 
has claimed more than 12000 lives 
the offer to resign referred only to garcias aprista post and 
not his position as the nations president 
the presidents opening address to the convention in lima friday 
night was marred by a shouting match between the 39yearold 
politician and many of the hundreds of party members in the 
auditorium 
it was the most strident opposition from within his party that 
garcia has faced since emerging as a leader of the centerleft party 
early in the decade 
the opposition offends the nationalistic and popular image of 
our party it serves to divides us garcia said in the 
resignation document which was delivered late saturday to the 16th 
national congress of the aprista party 
garcias reputation both within his party and outside has 
plummeted in the face of the economic crisis 
political analysts say the economic woes also have severely 
strained the countrys fragile democracy rumors of a pending 
military coup have surfaced repeatedly in recent months 
since garcia imposed the harshest austerity program in perus 
history in early september some members of his own party have 
demanded he resign as the nations president others have called for 
presidential elections to be stepped up by six months 
garcias approval rating among perus 21 million people has 
plunged from 96 percent during his first months in office he was 
called the president of hope by many party members to 16 
percent in late october according to the respected polling firm 
apoyo 
novelist mario vargas llosa named a candidate for president 
friday by the centerright coalition democratic front has emerged 
as one of garcias harshest critics 
most independent economists agree that perus current recession 
is caused by runaway inflation expected to hit 1800 percent this 
year and by uncontrolled government spending 
the next general elections are set for 1990 when garcias 
fiveyear term ends

dartmouth college and students the ivy 
league school punished for harassing a black professor go to court 
monday in a struggle between the administration and a conservative 
offcampus newspaper 
the students former editors of the weekly dartmouth review will 
ask a judge to find enough merit to their claims that they are 
victims of reverse discrimination to lift their suspensions 
provisionally 
john sutter 22 and christopher baldwin 21 both white were 
suspended in march by a campuswide disciplinary panel the panel 
found the two guilty of disorderly conduct for failing to leave 
professor william coles classroom after being asked 
the paper had called coles music class one of dartmouths most 
academically deficient in an article that drew charges of racism 
against the newspaper 
a third student received a shorter suspension and a fourth got 
probation for the february classroom clash with cole 
the reviews defenders say that had the students been black and 
cole white the discipline would have been far less severe 
sutter baldwin the third suspended student and the review 
charged in federal and state lawsuits that they were targeted for 
being outspoken about their conservative views which include 
opposition to womens studies courses and affirmative action at 
dartmouth 
the third student is not part of the hearing because he returned 
to class this fall said college spokesman alex huppe the fourth 
student did not join the lawsuits 
the students were disciplined to such a severe degree that even 
the college has no plausible explanation other than as a punishment 
for the statements and articles in the newspaper and thats a 
violation of their freedom of expression said arthur ruegger a 
lawyer representing the students 
to dartmouth the issues involved are authority and autonomy 
from the colleges point of view this is a private 
discip matter and were taking that extremely seriously 
huppe said friday were obviously defending the colleges 
disciplinary procedures 
the hearing in grafton county superior court is on bids by 
baldwin of hinsdale ill and sutter of st louis for a 
preliminary injunction if they win they will return to dartmouth 
in january rather than in september when their 18month suspensions 
expire huppe said 
though the hearing wont decide the core issues of the state 
lawsuit it will be an important first reading ruegger said 
the reviews supporters include such prominent conservatives as 
william f buckley jr and sens william armstrong rcolo and 
gordon humphrey rnh both senators attended a washington news 
conference in july to announce the lawsuits 
huppe said no first amendment issues are raised directly in the 
state case which he said is based on contract law 
but ruegger said freedom of expression will be addressed because 
it is guaranteed to students in dartmouths student handbook 
baldwin who has worked at buckleys national review since being 
suspended was one of 12 students mostly review staffers who 
conducted a nighttime sledgehammer attack on shanties erected on the 
college green in 1986 to symbolize the poverty of south african 
blacks 
the raid coming hours after a service marking the birthday of 
slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr triggered a 
semester of turmoil 
in march shortly after the college rejected appeals by baldwin 
and the other disciplined students dartmouth president james 
freedman called a special faculty meeting to denounce the review for 
poisoning the intellectual environment of our campus and 
threatening its moral endowment 
freedman dismissed review staffers as ideological provocateurs 
posing as journalists

communist party leader zhao ziyang on sunday 
marked the 10th anniversary of a historic meeting that ushered in 
chinas economic reforms by saying the current crisis in marxism 
offers new opportunities 
china is advancing and the world is changing zhao told about 
400 scholars and party officials at a symposium honoring a major 
central committee meeting held dec 1822 1978 
numerous problems are arising which call for answers to them 
some people say this has posed a crisis for marxism yet in fact 
for marxism challenges mean new opportunities for development 
the official xinhua news agency quoted zhao as saying 
celebrations of the anniversary have been subdued as a result of 
chinas worst economic crisis since deng xiaoping took control in 
1978 following the death in 1976 of chairman mao tsetung 
in september the government called for a prolonged economic 
slowdown including a pullback on some reforms to cope with an 
inflation rate officially set at 26 percent excessive government 
spending and a breakdown of financial controls 
zhao told the symposium that china must closely examine present 
conditions and learn from practice to develop marxist theory he 
stressed the idea that the country will be in a primary stage of 
socialism for the next century and its main task is to advance the 
productive forces 
the 1978 meeting is regarded as a turning point in chinese 
history deng a pragmatist who emerged as chinas leader 
introduced his reforms at the meeting he called for reorganizing 
the economy such as breaking up communes in favor of family 
farming and encouraging private initiative and marketoriented 
economic principles he also made clear that economic development 
not class struggle was chinas top priority 
in the past decade dengs reforms have doubled chinas gross 
national product and more than doubled personal incomes 
but the official guangming daily in an editorial on the 
anniversary said the tendency to try to achieve too much at one 
time has caused policy makers to stray from the seeking truth from 
facts concept emphasized by deng at the 1978 meeting 
they are problems in the process of advance and progress and so 
long as we stick to the principles adopted at the historical plenum 
we can overcome all these problems

the prince and princess of rival 
tribes were married in a christian ceremony sunday that followed 
three days of traditional festivities including the ritual 
slaughter of an ox 
the marriage joined the royal households of south africas two 
largest tribes the zulu and the xhosa and was noteworthy in a 
nation where some whites believe blacks are incapable of cooperating 
across tribal lines 
princess nomusa jeannett bhekuzulu 25 the sister of the zulu 
king married prince maxhoba sandile 40 the paramountchief 
designate of the rarabes tribe of the xhosas in the bisho the 
capital of ciskei 
ciskei is a xhosa homeland that was designated as independent by 
south africa but that is not recognized by other nations 
south african foreign minister pik botha ciskei president lennox 
sebe and zulu king goodwill zwelethini attended the wedding the 
zulus have refused the governments efforts to make their territory 
a separate nation 
on friday xhosa and zulu women wearing beaded skirts necklaces 
and anklets danced and chanted in the mud and blood around a speared 
ox 
tradition dictates that each time the ox is speared and does not 
fall the bridegrooms family must forfeit another goat to the 
brides household so the xhosa women waved straw switches at the 
ox urging it to die while the zulus held a mirror to its face so 
it could see its fate and rise to its feet 
the bridegroom and his men wearing beads and wrapped in 
blankets entered the royal corral near the ndakana great place 
where pieces of abdominal tissue of the sacrificial beast were 
sprinkled with salt and buried 
the bride and her bridesmaids covered in blankets to keep their 
faces hidden entered the stockade the bride plunged a spear into 
the mud at the entrance committing herself to the future of her 
husbands home 
on sunday about 4000 people gathered in ciskeis independence 
stadium amid tight security to watch the westernstyle christian 
wedding ceremony performed by a minister of the order of ethiopia 
botha arrived on a ciskei defense force helicopter and presented 
the couple with a loaf of bread baked by his wife he said they 
should eat it together and remain together calling the marriage a 
sign of the future for southern africa when all its inhabitants 
could come together in peace and harmony 
local newspapers said the marriage was the first time royal 
members of the historically antagonistic tribes had married 
the zulus and the xhosas are the two largest tribes in south 
africa each with more than 6 million and each alone outnumbering 
the whites who rule the country the wedding could be significant 
politically because of the belief by many afrikaners the dutch 
descendants who control the government that south african blacks 
cannot cooperate across tribal lines

more than 5000 people demonstrated 
outside the biblis nuclear power plant sunday to demand the closure 
of the facility where a recently disclosed malfunction took place 
in 1987 
about 170 groups participated in the demonstration including the 
environmentalist greens party and the west german federation for 
environmental citizens initiatives 
earlier in the day police dragged 24 demonstrators out of the 
plants information center which they had occupied overnight 
the two dozen protesters all were released but face possible charges 
of disturbing the peace 
during sundays demonstration speakers repeated assertions that 
a serious nuclear accident nearly developed at the biblis plant 30 
miles south of frankfurt one year ago 
pressure for closing the biblis plant erupted earlier this month 
after a us technical newsletter disclosed that on dec 1617 
1987 operators there allowed a malfunctioning cooling system valve 
to go uncorrected for 15 hours a small amount of radioactive steam 
escaped into the atmosphere during the incident 
the company that runs the plant rheinischwestfaelisches 
elektrizitaetwerk denies trying to conceal information about the 
incident and said it caused no damage to the public 
environmentalists charge that the accident could have led to a 
nuclear core meltdown but west german atomic officials say the 
plant is outfitted with emergency systems that would have prevented 
such an occurrence

a team of us seismologists flew to the soviet 
union sunday to help rebuild cities shattered by armenias 
earthquake tass said as the soviets turned their efforts from the 
rescue of survivors to reconstruction 
but armenians whose senses have been dulled by grief continue 
to hope more survivors can be found under collapsed homes and 
apartment buildings staterun radio moscow said 11 days after the 
earthquake that killed an estimated 55000 people 
the evening tv news program vremya said snow was forecast 
monday for armenia with temperatures as low as 9 degrees at night 
that would hamper relief workers trying to dig under the rubble and 
pose more hardships for thousands of homeless now living under tents 
and out of doors 
we must hurry these words are now in the souls and on the 
lips of thousands of people who are helping liquidate the 
consequences of the tragedy tass said in a report on sundays 
meeting of a special politburo commission overseeing the relief 
effort 
the commission which visited the stricken city of spitak said 
the evacuation of children women and the elderly from the disaster 
zone was nearing completion and that in two or three days only 
those who participate in rehabilitation work would remain 
pravda the communist party daily reported that in the first 10 
days following the dec 7 quake 15252 people had been dug out 
alive from the ruins of armenian cities and villages where an 
estimated 500000 people were left homeless 
but judging from official media reports attempts by soviet and 
foreign rescue teams to locate additional survivors in the shambles 
of leninakan spitak and other northwest armenian cities crumbled by 
the quake were becoming futile 
only one survivor was rescued in the 24hour period ending 
saturday night the tass news agency said during the same period 
89 bodies were extricated from the ruins 
there were no reports sunday of any more survivors 
the first most acute phase of the rescue effort is coming to 
an end radio moscow said preparations have started for 
restoring the industries and housing 
dutch television journalist alexander munninghoff who returned 
to moscow sunday from spitak said all foreign relief workers had 
been asked to leave the city by tuesday apparently because the 
search was ending 
no official announcement has been made of an end to the search a 
potentially explosive issue in armenia where some people have sat 
in front of bulldozers to prevent the clearing of debris until it 
can be searched for victims 
ap photographer boris yurchenko who also was in spitak said the 
city that was once home to 25000 people was now nearly deserted 
with a few people searching for relatives remaining behind and 
taking shelter in tin garages left standing by the quake 
an estimated 15000 people were killed in spitak and many 
decomposing bodies still lie buried in ruined buildings 
the smell is becoming more and more pronounced every day 
yurchenko said the first sign of the terrible threat of an 
epidemic dead dogs and swarming rats are forcing rescue teams to 
hurry since no leveling of the town can be done with corpses still 
remaining in their stone graves 
tass said 16 american seismologists were flying to the soviet 
union sunday bringing specialists in the construction of 
earthquakeresistant buildings and in the organization of rescue and 
rebuilding operations 
president mikhail s gorbachev has criticized the flimsy fiveand 
ninestory apartment buildings constructed in the 1960s and 1970s 
that collapsed during the quake 
armenian activists embittered by moscows refusal to grant their 
demands in a territorial dispute with neighboring azerbaijan have 
accused the central government of bungling relief efforts and not 
doing enough to warn armenians of the danger of an impending 
earthquake 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who heads a special politburo 
commission overseeing the relief campaign expressed frustration 
with the unwelcome moods of some armenians in comments broadcast 
sunday by radio moscow 
soviet media continued to report on an official crackdown against 
armenian militants including members of the karabakh committee six 
of whose leaders have been arrested 
the committee has spearheaded the 11monthold campaign for 
annexation of nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian district of 
azerbaijan 
tass said the soviet union has concluded an agreement with the 
usbased american telephone and telegraph co that will allow 
armenians to make collect calls to the united states where many 
have friends and relatives usually soviets cannot place collect 
calls 
tass said that since the quake telephone traffic between armenia 
and the united states has increased eightfold

police officers on sunday defied the 
government and went to the polls to elect union representatives for 
the first time in the 155year history of their force 
thousands of police officers gathered in central athens to elect 
a 15member executive committee for the union of lower ranking 
police officers the first in greek police history 
despite government objections the union was set up earlier this 
year to represent officers with a rank of sergeant or below the 
union now has 18000 registered members said sgt kostas siggounis 
acting chairman of the union 
the government which claims it is unconstitutional for police 
officers to form a union has threatened them with transfers to 
remote provincial posts administrative punishment and dismissal 
union founders say 
union elections took place in the provinces last week and all 
votes will be counted in athens on sunday 
the greek police is structured much like an army and is run by 
the ministry of public order which has said that unionization 
disrupts the chain of command and the police hierarchys method of 
operation 
they are worried that we will start questioning orders and 
upset the hierarchy in the greek police said yiannis kotsis 
another union member 
the greek constitution forbids members of the police to go on 
strike but doesnt say anything about forming a union kotsis 
said because of his union activities the officer has been 
transferred from athens where he served for 17 years to the 
northern town of grevena about 275 miles north of the capital 
siggounis and other officers say their aim is to modernize the 
force and secure better living and working conditions a police 
officers starting salary is 394 a month siggounis said

plo officials accused washington of 
maintaining a doublestandard in its middle east policy sunday and 
pledged to keep up attacks on israeli military targets though they 
have renounced terror 
reagan may stop his governments dialogue with the plo now if 
he thinks he will be able to stop our attacks against israeli 
military targets said salah khalaf secondincommand to yasser 
arafat in fatah the largest group in the palestine liberation 
organization 
arafats denunciation of terrorism in geneva did not include 
military attacks against israel said khalaf also known as abu 
iyad he spoke at a rally and a news conference in abu dhabi united 
arab emirates 
our struggle will continue until we raise the palestinian flag 
over jerusalem he said 
arafat spoke last week to the un general assembly in geneva 
where the bodys session relocated after washington refused to grant 
him a visa to visit un headquarters in new york 
on sunday he met in cairo with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
to discuss how to keep momentum gained by the first direct usplo 
dialogue that began last week 
both arafat and mubarak told reporters an international peace 
conference could lead to direct talks between israel and the plo 
israel and the united states should not fear the convening of 
the international peace conference because it will definitely lead 
to direct negotiations said mubarak 
arafat added do you think we are going to the conference to 
talk to ourselves no we are going to negotiate with our enemies 
in tunis khalid hassan a senior adviser to arafat said he 
hopes presidentelect george bush will formulate a clear policy that 
will lead to an international peace conference on the middle east 
i dont understand the policy of the us government 
unfortunately they adopt a doublestandard of thinking and 
talking said hassan a cofounder of fatah 
the us government needs a lot of work to prove its 
credibility i hope bush will do that hassan said in an interview 
two days after fridays usplo talks in tunis 
the united states last week reversed a 13year ban on official 
contacts with the plo after arafat renounced terrorism recognized 
israels right to exist and accepted un resolutions guaranteeing 
safe borders for countries in the region 
washington has refused to recognize an independent palestinian 
state the plo proclaimed in algiers last month without specifying 
its borders 
the next usplo meeting is expected after the bush 
administration takes office jan 20 
arafat told reporters in tunis saturday that the plos main 
priority is the early convening of an international peace conference 
on the middle east 
israel has refused to include the plo which it regards as a 
terror group as a partner in peace talks and has demanded direct 
talks with nonplo palestinians 
the plo serves as an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla 
factions which sometimes fight among themselves or launch 
independent attacks on israeli targets the largest group is 
arafats fatah 
hassan said the plo rejects the idea of the united states as a 
sole mediator in talks because the americans took sides 
already 
he stressed there can be no middle east peace settlement without 
soviet involvement and he said washington and moscow must agree on 
the international conference 
in israel nearly 200 members of the leftofcenter labor party 
called on the party to accept the plo as a partner for peace talks 
israel radio said 
there is a need to talk to palestinians and the plo which has 
changed from a terrorist organization to a political organization 
labor legislator haim ramon said on israel radio during the meeting 
in tel aviv 
in jerusalem labor ministers put forward a 10yearold proposal 
to grant autonomy to palestinians in the occupied territories in a 
weekly cabinet session

israeli peace activists skirted an army blockade 
to meet with palestinians sunday journalists reported on a day of 
more clashes in the occupied lands with three arabs reported killed 
and at least 22 wounded 
a 9monthold israeli girl knocked unconscious in a weekend 
stoning attack on a car was in serious but stable condition at 
hadassah hospital in jerusalem a hospital spokeswoman said 
the army confirmed all three deaths sunday but a military 
spokesman said he knew of only four palestinians wounded arab 
hospital officials and reporters said at least 22 were wounded 
at a cabinet meeting prime minister yitzhak shamir indirectly 
criticized us and european leaders in comments on the opening of 
us diplomatic contacts with the plo israel radio reported 
the whole world wants us to withdraw from judea and samaria 
the radio quoted shamir as saying they are weary of the conflict 
the world concentrates more on an israeli withdrawal than on the 
need for peace 
judea and samaria are the biblical names for the west bank 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said the premier planned to 
counter the latest us move by launching his own initiative with a 
trip to washington in february or march 
the clashes erupted during a general strike called to protest 
five arab deaths friday in the west bank city of nablus hospital 
officials said 
despite the violence a group of about 40 israelis sponsored by 
the leftist peace now movement traveled to the west bank town of 
beit sahur to tell a church filled with 400 palestinian worshipers 
they favored dialogue with the plo 
the activists including legislator ran cohen of the leftwing 
citizens rights movement reached the town by a back road after the 
army shut main roads into the town news photographers at the scene 
said 
we believe that now there is only one possibility of solution 
a solution which includes a palestinian independent state beside 
the state of israel cohen said during the visit 
asked why the army tried to seal off the town a military 
spokesman said there were warnings that there would be attempts 
to disrupt public order in the area and therefore it was decided to 
close it 
issa yacoub massad a beit sahur resident said youths in the 
town had agreed not to throw stones during the visit 
before the israelis spoke at the church townspeople broke into 
the palestinian anthem homeland homeland later about 200 
palestinian women demonstrated outside chanting proplo slogans and 
waving a plo flag soldiers ordered them to disperse and there was 
no violence 
sundays general strike paralyzed public transportation and 
commerce throughout the occupied territories and complicated 
israels efforts to reopen west bank high schools which have been 
shut since september 
a military government spokesman said all the high schools opened 
except those in nablus which has been under curfew since bloody 
clashes claimed five victims friday but arab news reports said many 
of the 50000 high school pupils didnt attend classes because of 
the strike 
sundays fatalities were identified by hospital officials as 
ibrahim mohammed badran 24 of deir al ghusun village near tulkarem 
in the west bank zoheir ismail fiyad 22 of shabura in gaza and 
mohammed ferhat 30 also of shabura 
their deaths raised to 332 the number of palestinians killed in 
the yearlong uprising against israeli occupation thirteen israelis 
also have been killed 
an army spokesman said badran was shot as he tried to throw a 
concrete block at a soldier from a rooftop as troops conducted a 
search and arrest raid in his hometown of 3000 
the second fatality fiyad a student at gazas islamic 
university was shot during a protest in the shabura neighborhood of 
rafah on the egyptian border in gaza an official at nearby nasser 
hospital said 
an army spokesman confirmed fiyads death but said investigators 
were checking the circumstances 
the other victim died at a un clinic in rafah according to 
arab reports other casualties occurred during eight clashes in gaza 
and the west bank hospital officials said arab news reports said a 
curfew was placed on nablus qalqilya and the deir al balah refugee

reagan administration officials on sunday vowed 
to closely monitor whether the palestine liberation organization 
honors its antiterrorism pledge even as a top plo spokesman 
signaled intentions to continue military attacks on israel 
the administration already is under harsh criticism from israel 
for its firstever dialogue with the plo on sunday plo advisor 
khalid hassan charged in an interview in tunis that the united 
states is pursuing an ambiguous middle east policy 
in addition salah khalaf second in command to plo leader yasser 
arafat in fatah the largest plo group told an abu dhabi news 
conference that arafats denunciation of terrorism last week did 
not include military attacks against israel 
our struggle will continue until we raise the palestinian flag 
over jerusalem he said 
state department spokesman dennis harter said sunday he was 
unfamiliar with the comments and there would be no immediate comment 
from the department 
meanwhile administration officials said sunday they will be 
checking to ensure that arafat keeps his word 
while acknowledging that arafat does not control all palestinian 
factions that may engage in terrorism assistant secretary of state 
richard murphy said us officials have our sources we have our 
means of finding out whether he honors his commitment against 
terrorism 
we are going to take these things on a casebycase basis the 
president has made it plain we cant sustain this dialogue if 
terrorism continues murphy said on the abctv program this week 
with david brinkley 
national security adviser colin powell appearing on another 
sunday television program said the united states will be watching 
their performance on terrorism very very carefully 
if we see an act of terrorism and it can be traced back to the 
plo leadership then clearly they will be breaking their word 
powell said on nbctvs meet the press but of course 
violence is a way of life in the middle east regrettably and it 
isnt clear that every act of violence or every terrorist incident 
can be traced back to the plo but it is something we will be 
watching very carefully 
murphy speaking on the abc program added 
terrorism has been renounced in words now we will see what 
happens what is plain is we are not going to go on words alone 
michael armacost undersecretary of state for political affairs 
said the united states expected arafat not only to speak against 
terrorism but to expel from the plo anyone involved in terrorist 
acts and also to distance the organization from any elements close 
to the plo linked to terrorism 
were not talking simply about condemning were talking about 
disassociation and expulsion he said in an interview on cbstvs 
face the nation 
israeli officials outraged at president reagans reversal of 
longstanding us policy against talking to the plo showed no signs 
sunday of abandoning their position 
benjamin netanyahu a member of the israeli knesset and former 
israeli ambassador to the united nations complained that the united 
states did not consult with its ally before making the decision 
wednesday 
netanyahu called the move a surprise at a very late hour in the 
night 
he warned that the decision will strain usisraeli relations 
and said the complete trust that israel had shared with the 
united states has been shaken badly 
i think there are specific consequences i hope we dont come 
to that he said on the abc program you achieve peace by good 
faith negotiations and by keeping your commitments by keeping your 
word and frankly i think theres been a shakeup in our belief in 
americas commitment and its credibility 
israeli foreign minister shimon peres speaking on the cbs 
program said israel was skeptical of arafats renunciation of 
terrorism and would wait a couple of months and see if this is 
really going to happen 
peres said it was his position that israel should negotiate with 
every palestinian who is not engaged in terror and who wants 
to negotiate a peaceful solution but he added i have my doubts 
about mr arafat 
armacost asked how the united states could justify opening a 
dialogue with the plo while its charter calls for the destruction of 
israel said arafats actions this week superseded that declaration 
the israelis contend the plo is engaging in a rhetorical ruse to 
win support for an independent palestinian state it plans to use as 
a base to attack israel 
armacost said any such attempt would ultimately hurt the plo 
they have indicated publicly that they accept israels right to 
exist in peace and safety he said and if this is a clever 
tactical ruse not only will the dialogue with us go nowhere but 
there is no prospect of peace and they should have no illusions

parliament on sunday approved the 1989 
budget proposed by the embattled socialist government of premier 
andreas papandreou who threatened to resign if the spending plan 
did not pass 
papandreou termed it a vote of confidence the vote came four 
days after the resignation of his deputy national economy minister 
the seventh cabinetlevel official to step down since a 
multimilliondollar banking and arms scandals surfaced in october 
with a raise of hands parliament voted 156 to 140 with two 
abstentions by leftist lawmakers in favor of the record 279 
billion budget that is projected to run a 96 billion deficit 
the budget plan sparked recent strikes and demonstrations by 
educators and other government employees who demanded higher pay 
raises to keep up with a 15percent inflation rate 
all those voting in favor of the budget were from papandreous 
governing panhellenic socialist movement or pasok the conservative 
new democracy party along with the greek communist party voted 
against the budget describing it as the worst in greek history 
the conservatives and the communists declined to participate in 
the fiveday debate in the 300member singlechamber house 
rumors circulated before the crucial vote that several pasok 
deputies were ready to bolt the party and vote against the budget 
but defections never materialized as the 69yearold papandreou 
made one of his rare appearances in parliament to keep his deputies 
in line 
the opposition has repeatedly called for papandreou to resign 
since october when the 300 million scandal rose to the surface 
implicating senior members of his government 
papandreou has adamantly refused to step down and said he intends 
to remain until his term in office expires in june when general 
elections are scheduled but he told a nationwide television 
audience saturday that he would quit if the budget was not approved 
i want to tell the greek people that this vote is for me a vote 
of confidence papandreou said 
opposition parties say government officials were involved in 
illegal deals allegedly set up by banker george koskotas who is 
accused of influence peddling embezzlement and fraud 
the transactions allegedly involved directly or indirectly 
the prime minister and members of his party including papandreous 
son george who is minister of education 
last week deputy defense minister stathis yiotas quit saying he 
did not want to be associated with adventurers swindlers and 
embezzlers of public money 
he charged the directors of the greek arms industry of paying 
commissions of millions of dollars for unfulfilled contracts to arms 
dealers hiding behind dummy companies koskotas claims to have 
documents implicating senior government officials in illegal money 
transfers abroad 
the scandal widened when greek newspapers and opposition parties 
accused officials working for the post office telephone company and 
other public services of receiving interest rates above the legal 
limit from the bank of crete and pocketing the difference 
koskotas the former chairman of the bank of crete fled greece 
nov 6 and has been arrested in the united states the 34yearold 
banker who first fled to brazil and bermuda is in a boston mass 
prison awaiting an extradition hearing 
koskotas who ran a housepainting business in new york from 1974 
to 1979 also is charged with attempting to defraud the us 
internal revenue service a hearing is scheduled in us district 
court in manhattan on jan 9

lawsuit over pesticide pollution will begin receiving checks this 
week ranging up to 22500 as their shares of a 15 million 
settlement 
olin corp closed the ddt plant at redstone arsenal in huntsville 
some 18 years ago the 1980 lawsuit filed against olin by the 
federal government grew out of reports of illnesses among residents 
living near or fishing from waterways fed by a stream from the plant 
us district judge uw clemon of birmingham who approved the 
classaction settlement in 1986 reviewed and approved the 
distribution formula late last month 
all 9400 claimants were required to submit to blood tests and 
complete an extensive questionnaire 
of the letters going out beginning wednesday about 3300 will 
contain checks ranging from 500 to 22500 the other 6100 letters 
will inform recipients that their ddt levels were not found to be 
elevated officials said 
the good news will be for those who receive letters saying they 
have a normal level of ddt in their body francis mcgovern 
special master of the courtapproved settlement plan said saturday 
about onethird of the 15 million settlement went to pay for 
legal fees and medical testing he said 
according to mcgovern the ddt levels of two residents measured 
45 times above normal each will receive a check for 22500 
sixteen people had levels 20 times or more above normal and will 
receive checks of 10000 or higher the lowest payments about 
500 will go to some 1625 plaintiffs whose ddt levels were twice 
normal

friends and foes of nuclear power say they see 
the bush administration taking a strong position in favor of atomic 
energy provided strict safety requirements can be met 
our initial analysis is that well see a real push for new 
nuclear power plants said michael mariotte director of the 
nuclear information and resource service a washingtonbased group 
opposed to nuclear power 
mariotte pointed to campaign statements by bush and his choice of 
new hampshire gov john sununu an ardent supporter of nuclear 
power to serve as white house chief of staff 
with john sununu in the white house the nuclear industry has 
its most powerful close friend ever mariotte said it never had 
a president or someone who ranks as high as sununu does who is so 
ideologically compatible with the industry 
sununu has repeatedly locked horns with massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis over the controversial seabrook nuclear power plant 
dukakis refused to submit evacuation plans for massachusetts towns 
located within 10 miles of the stalled new hampshire plant which 
sununu supports 
during the campaign bush issued a policy statement saying that 
clearly our overriding concern on nuclear power issues must be to 
protect the safety of the public if nuclear power plants do not 
reach the highest safety standards they should not be licensed 
but if they do meet these standards i strongly believe we must 
have nuclear power we must protect ourselves from dependance on 
foreign oil we must diversify our energy sources and safe nuclear 
power can help improve our energy security 
the republican party platform also called for expansion of 
nuclear power provided environmental and safety standards were met 
bush also will have to deal with safety and environmental 
problems plaguing the energy departments nuclear weapons production 
and research complex 
during his second debate with dukakis the democratic 
presidential candidate bush said the departments savannah river 
plant in south carolina needs to be made more safe will he 
dukakis join me in suggesting that we may need another plant 
maybe in idaho to take care of the nuclear material 
requirements for our defense department 
much will depend on whom bush names as his secretary of energy 
among the names repeatedly mentioned are peter johnson former head 
of oregons bonneville power administration and former rep henson 
moore rla 
craig fuller cochairman of bushs transition team said in an 
interview last week that the bush forces are focusing the search on 
someone who has the expertise to handle the nuclear waste question 
jacob sherr an attorney with the new yorkbased natural 
resources defense council said i have seen no evidence so far 
that bush is really going to roll up his sleeves and that 
administration officials are going to commit themselves to 
doubling or tripling the does nuclear weapons budget to really get 
serious about cleaning up the mess 
bush is expected to retain lando w zech jr as chairman of the 
nuclear regulatory commission until zechs term expires in june he 
then will have the opportunity to name a new commissioner and select 
the panels next chairman 
my guess is that bush will appoint somebody whos much in the 
zech mold somebody whos going to continue the efforts zech has 
started to set the stage as far as the government is able to 
enable a nuclear resurgence mariotte said 
harold finger president of the us council for energy 
awareness a washingtonbased nuclear industry group said he hoped 
bush would demonstrate federal leadership in helping persuade 
state regulators to lift some economic disincentives that have 
discouraged utilities from investing in new nuclear power plants 
edward m davis president of the american nuclear energy 
council the nuclear industrys chief lobbying arm predicted the 
new administration will find congress supportive of measures to 
further the development of nuclear power 
legislation expected to be introduced in the new congress deals 
with such issues as federal support for development of advanced 
reactor designs reforming nrc licensing procedures and reorganizing 
the fivemember nrc as an agency headed by a single administrator 
the industrys rosy outlook for nuclear power however is 
disputed by another washingtonbased antinuclear group the safe 
energy communication council 
the council said a september national opinion poll it 
commissioned found that 59 percent of those responding opposed 
further nuclear power development 36 percent favored building more 
nuclear reactors and 5 percent didnt know the poll had a 3 percent 
margin of error 
in proposing to build new nuclear power plants george bush and 
other nuclear power cheerleaders are way out of touch with main 
street usa said scott denman the groups director

in the 40 years since israel became a state 
diplomatic efforts to settle the arabisraeli conflict have resulted 
in a string of partial successes and lost opportunities 
saeb erakat a palestinian political science professor at an 
najah university in the west bank said the middle east impasse has 
proved resistant to 77 separate initiatives since 1948 
even if current efforts lead to a peace agreement he said it 
would take a long time to overcome the bitterness 
we should not underestimate the years of violence hatred and 
war there is a wall higher than the great wall of china between us 
and it will not be destroyed by the stroke of a pen erakat said 
in an interview 
both the us decision last week to open a dialogue with yasser 
arafats palestine liberation organization and new prospects for 
sovietamerican cooperation have raised the possibility of a new 
initiative 
the initiative likely would focus on convening a unsponsored 
international peace conference but prospects are cloudy because 
israel has rejected such a conference as a biased forum and the plo 
as an unfit partner 
analysts such as former secretary of state henry kissinger 
believe that even if palestinians and israelis could be brought to 
the table the meeting would be pointless without first narrowing 
differences on key issues 
i know no arab state nor do i see anything in a plo 
statement that would accept even the 1967 borders of israel he 
said on abctvs nightline on wednesday apparently referring to 
israels borders before the 1967 middle east war in which israel 
seized arab territory 
i know no israeli government that can consider going back 
exactly to the 1967 borders he said 
us peacemaking up to and including the current administration 
has focused on trying to forge compromise over sovereignty and 
territory 
the us initiatives have tried to get the arabs to accept 
palestinian autonomy and confederation with jordan in place of a 
fully independent state 
they have supported israels need to keep some of the 2250 
square miles of land captured in the 1967 war the west bank and 
the gaza strip but have proposed international guarantees 
security zones and peacekeeping forces to persuade israel to give up 
most of the territory 
until now they have denied participation of the plo 
involving the plo is the new element said joseph kostiner of 
tel aviv universitys middle east studies center its a turning 
point in the peace process 
peace initiatives have usually been set in motion by outbreaks of 
war or an upsurge in violence 
the first arabiraeli war in 1948 resulted in unmediated 
proximity talks on the greek island of rhodes headed by un 
envoy ralph bunche diplomats shuttled between hotel rooms because 
arab delegations refused to meet with israelis 
israel eventually signed agreements with syria lebanon jordan 
and egypt that fixed ceasefire lines set up buffer zones and 
created armistice commissions 
in the wake of the sixday war in 1967 un envoy gunnar 
jarring of sweden unsuccessfully sought to promote a landforpeace 
settlement in accordance with un resolution 242 which has served 
as the basis for all future peace efforts 
the resolution calls for israels withdrawal from territory 
occupied in 1967 and for the right of all nations in the region to 
exist within secure borders 
in 196970 thensecretary of state william rogers presented a 
series of plans that halted the egyptisrael war of attrition 
israel agreed to withdrawal based on resolution 242 and egypt agreed 
to recognize israel but the initiative was aborted by the death of 
egyptian president gamal abdel nasser 
the yom kippur war in 1973 led to the geneva peace conference 
that december in which the united states and soviet union served as 
cochairmen the conference was the first to bring arab states and 
israel together face to face 
the meeting was adjourned after one day and never reconvened 
egypt jordan and israel participated but syria stayed home and the 
plo was not invited 
in 1974 israel raised with kissinger the possibility of a 
separationofforces agreement that included the return of the west 
bank town of jericho to jordan but the idea was shelved when an 
arab summit ruled that the plo and not jordan was responsible for 
the occupied land 
in 1977 the soviet union and united states issued a rare joint 
policy statement recognizing the legitimate rights of the 
palestinians and offering demilitarized zones un troops and 
guarantees to insure israels security after withdrawal 
egypts president anwar sadat preempted the plan by launching 
his own intiative 
the 1978 camp david accords served as the basis for the 
egyptianisraeli peace treaty the following year and but failed to 
resolve the palestinian question they offered palestinians limited 
selfgovernment for a fiveyear transition period after which the 
final status of the west bank and gaza would be determined 
saudia arabias king fahd then crown prince in 1981 offered a 
plan that implicitly recognized israels right to live in peace but 
tensions leading up to the lebanon war undermined the effort 
in september 1982 as palestinian guerrillas were leaving 
israelibesieged beirut president reagan urged a plan that ruled 
out a palestinian state but proposed that the west bank and gaza 
strip become an autonomous region associated with jordan 
us diplomacy subsequently focused on getting jordans king 
hussein to stand in for the plo in peace talks at the head of a 
jordanianpalestinian delegation that option was dealt a blow in 
july when hussein announced he was severing ties with the west bank

indian prime minister rajiv gandhi arrived in the 
chinese capital monday in the first visit to china by an indian 
leader since his grandfather jawaharlal nehru came 34 years ago 
gandhi flew into beijing on a special air india jet provided for 
the trip his usual plane remained in new delhi because rats had 
gnawed electrical cables in the aircraft 
the fiveday visit marks the first time the leaders of the 
worlds two most populous countries have met since 1960 when 
premier chou enlai went to new delhi china has about 108 billion 
people and india has about 880 million 
gandhi will meet with the communist governments leaders in 
beijing tour the ancient city of xian and visit shanghai 
on arrival at the airport the indian prime minister wearing a 
brown overcoat was greeted by about 100 indians who live in 
beijing he made no statement to reporters 
before leaving his country gandhi said the visit will be very 
important for this globe for asia and for both of us 
the two nations are expected to sign agreements on civil 
aviation border trade and science and technology consular offices 
in the chinese city of shanghai and the indian city of bombay may 
also be established as a result 
however little progress is expected on the main issue dividing 
the two countries their 2400milelong border they fought a brief 
border war in 1962 and china occupied about 15000 square miles of 
indian territory that india still wants back 
the two countries began border talks in 1981 but made little 
progress in eight rounds 
india was one of the first nonsocialist countries to recognize 
communist china soon after chinas 1949 revolution 
in the early 1960s relations deteriorated over the border issue 
as well as personal and political disagreements between chinese 
leader mao tsetung and prime minister nehru 
in the late 1970s relations improved slightly when china began 
emphasizing traditional statetostate relations instead of 
exporting communist revolution 
both chinese and indian officials say gandhis visit is intended 
to create an atmosphere for greater communication not resolve the 
border question

the ku klux klan littered a parade route 
early sunday with hundreds of cards wishing for a white 
christmas but a city crew picked up all the cards before the 
event began police said 
the holiday parade which earlier had been postponed when klan 
imperial wizard tony bastanzio threatened to demand a place in the 
lineup went off without incident 
the small christmas cards read dreaming of a white christmas 
merry christmas the ku klux klan 
police will try to determine where they were printed and who 
ordered them chief bob roberts said they were distributed between 
midnight and 2 am he said 
they came in like a thief in the night roberts said 
the city crew had the cards picked up by 930 am well before 
the midafternoon parade started bastanzio declined to comment 
before or after the parade 
earlier this month the lions club gave bastanzio permission to 
drive a vehicle carrying robed klansmen in the parade but the club 
which has sponsored the annual parade for 17 years later removed 
the kkk from the lineup after mayor jeff book and business leaders 
objected 
more than 50 police officers and sheriffs deputies were at the 
parade roberts said police said they were unaware of any klansmen 
in the area 
a heavy turnout for the parade represented a refusal to accept 
racial prejudice in the central florida community of 6000 roberts 
said 
that type of action isnt tolerated in mount dora he said 
communities in general just arent going to put up with it

foreign ministers eduard shevardnadze and sousuke 
uno began talks monday that diplomats on both sides hope will help 
normalize sovietjapanese relations stalled more than 40 years over 
an emotional border dispute 
the two sides were expected to discuss regional issues including 
the korean peninsula sinosoviet relations and kampuchea during 
their first session foreign ministry officials said 
a key issue of their three rounds of talks will be the dispute 
over sovietheld kurile islands off japans northern coast the 
main obstacle shevardnadze and uno must overcome to pave the way for 
improved relations between the two asian powers 
shevardnadze who arrived sunday from moscow on the first stop of 
a threenation asian tour expressed hopes the territorial dispute 
will not further delay improvement in sovietjapanese relations 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has expressed interest in 
increased economic cooperation and political dialogue with japan 
but no real progress is likely until moscow agrees to return the 
islands said diplomats in tokyo who requested anonymity 
japansoviet political dialogue and mutual understanding is 
generally delayed by the dispute shevardnadze acknowledged after 
he arrived at tokyos haneda international airport 
while there are objective reasons for this it should be 
possible to relax or eliminate the reasons for this delay in 
improved relations he added 
the soviet envoy his wife and a 40member entourage were greeted 
at the airport by uno toshiaki muto the japanese ambassador to 
moscow and nikolai soloviev the soviet ambassador to japan 
substantial political dialogue between the two countries is 
overdue shevardnadze said adding were trying to decide what to 
do 
both moscow and tokyo claim the kuril islands which since world 
war ii have been occupied by soviet troops who had ousted the 17000 
japanese residents for decades the soviets refused to admit a 
territorial issue existed but officials on both sides have said 
they hope to make progress toward a resolution during shevardnadzes 
visit 
authorities were concerned about shevardnadzes safety because of 
protests by japanese rightwing groups demanding return of the 
islands the airport was heavily guarded and in central tokyo 
authorities increased security around the soviet embassy where the 
foreign minister is staying 
one protester allegedly a member of a rightist group was 
arrested sunday for ignoring a police order to stop an 
antishevardnadze speech amplified by loudspeakers police said 
shevardnadzes visit comes as moscow is wooing capitalist asian 
nations with promises of military cutbacks in the region and 
requests for foreign investment 
in his discussions with japanese officials shevardnadze is 
expected to bring up economic cooperation which gorbachev has said 
is needed to develop the soviet republics in asia 
the soviet need for advanced technology may give japan leverage 
to negotiate the disputed islands said ichiro suetsugu who heads 
the private council on national security problems 
trade between the soviet union and japan reached 49 billion in 
1987 but is expected to climb only slightly this year to 498 
billion 
japanese businessmen lured by the huge soviet market complain 
that the soviets lack hard currency to pay for imported goods and 
that restrictions on selling products in the soviet union make joint 
ventures unprofitable 
the foreign ministry has said the two nations will issue joint 
statements on cultural exchanges and protection of migratory birds 
after shevardnadzes departure wednesday 
japanese officials say they also will renew an invitation for 
gorbachev to visit japan for a summit the last japansoviet summit 
was in october 1973 
shevardnadze is to leave tokyo on wednesday for the philippines 
and north korea

archbishop arturo rivera damas 
on sunday condemned political assassinations and a new leftist 
guerrilla practice of intimidating elected officials into resigning 
political passions are building and respect for the sovereign 
will of the people expressed at the polls is respected less he 
said during his weekly homily 
rivera damas said an investigation by the church legal aid office 
found local authorities who are members of the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance on tuesday killed francisco eduardo bonilla a 
member of the christian democratic party in soyapango four miles 
east of san salvador 
bonilla worked with the central elections council in registering 
voters 
testimony gathered by legal aid office holds the mayor and city 
police of soyapango responsible which if confirmed would be 
serious rivera damas said 
the mayor jorge corena is a member of the republican 
nationalist alliance known by its spanish acronym arena 
the archbishop also condemned recent actions by the leftist 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln the umbrella 
group of five guerrilla groups fighting for nine years to overthrow 
the usbacked government 
equally worrisome is the new practice of the fmln of forcing 
elected officials to resign their posts he said information 
from this week tells of three mayors who could not resist guerrilla 
threats and announced their resignations 
since may when new mayors took office the group has killed 
eight mayors it accused of taking part in government 
counterinsurgency efforts 
arena is currently considered the frontrunner against the 
governing christian democrats in the salvadoran presidential 
elections scheduled for march 19

outflows of money leaving 17 heavily indebted 
third world countries from argentina to nigeria to the 
philippines are due to reach 311 billion this year the world 
bank estimates in a study released sunday 
last years figure was 218 billion almost onethird lower 
from all third world debtors the net outflow was 43 billion up 
from 381 billion 
the money was largely payments on debt it went to commercial 
banks and governments in the united states and other industrial 
countries and to intergovernment lenders like the world bank itself 
the bank is owned by 151 governments with the united states 
holding the largest number of shares 
in the past money tended to flow the other way out of rich 
countries in the form of loans and investments to develop the poor 
ones that tradition was still working as late as 1982 when the big 
debtors took in 37 billion more than they paid out according to 
the banks figures 
the bank issued a statement sunday emphasizing that loss of funds 
by debtor countries hits their people in future generations too 
although both incomes and consumption have fallen incomes in 
most highly indebted countries are lower today than a decade ago 
the adjustment burden has fallen mainly on investment it said 
the drop of investment means fewer schools and roads and jobs in the 
future 
stanley fischer vice president and top economist at the world 
bank said its annual report on debt carried two messages 
the first is that despite remarkably rapid growth in the 
industrialized world in 1988 growth in the debtor nations has not 
resumed the second message is that the debt strategy is entering a 
new phase in which debt reduction is playing an increasingly 
important role 
the report raised the banks estimate of third world debt to 
132 trillion at the end of this year the total is expected to 
drop to 13 trillion in 1989 it said debt has been growing more 
slowly in terms of the dollar because of changes in currency values 
some agreements to reduce debt and the continued reluctance of 
commercial banks to make new loans 
fischer said governments are rethinking the debt problem but he 
said the idea of a new international body to buy up commercial debt 
at a discount is just talk he explained that governments in 
creditor countries dislike the idea because it could look like 
bailing out the commercial banks 
the idea was urged by soviet president mikhail gorbachev in his 
speech to the united nations earlier this month the trade law 
signed by president reagan last august instructs the secretary of 
the treasury to start negotiations on a new international body but 
adds that he need not if he thinks the move would drive down the 
value of the loans 
loans of a dozen major debtor countries are selling now at an 
average of 40 cents on the dollar according to the shearson lehman 
hutton developing country debt index 
the world bank suggested that commercial banks should do more to 
share the benefit of these discounts with the debtor countries 
debtor governments have already bought back some of their loans for 
cash or allowed creditors to use them for buying up shares in 
debtor country industries 
governments of the creditor countries were urged to harmonize 
their tax systems and regulations to encourge banks to lend more 
and in some cases to guarantee the loans those governments should 
also encourage imports from the debtors while debtor governments 
should change their policies to encourage loans and investments it 
added 
new figures released by the bank show that in 1980 the share of 
the average argentine in the national income was 1990 while last 
year that share was down to 1630 of those 1980 dollars in mexico 
the drop was from 2690 to 2290 
in african countries south of the sahara average incomes dropped 
52 percent in 1987 the bank reported though the debts of many 
african countries are small they make a heavier burden than in some 
latin american countries because africans are fewer and poorer 
their average income was down from 570 dollars in 1980 to 440 of 
those dollars last year 
president carlos salinas de gortari announced on friday that he 
would try to borrow another 6 billion for mexico in the coming 
year that would be less than about 9 billion the country is due to 
pay out as interest and repayments on its present debt of 102 
billion 
salinas and other leaders of latin america debtor countries are 
expected to make a bid soon to negotiate a cut in the total debt and 
the payments on it salinas said mexico would only service its own 
debt if payments are compatible with the countrys growth

a worker at a roman catholic high school has 
been charged with sexual abusing male students at the school paying 
one student for sex and secretly videotaping others running naked in 
the buildings basement 
robert e cushing 36 was arrested friday and charged with six 
counts of thirddegree sexual abuse one count of prostitution and 
one count of solicitation 
according to an affidavit four male students at dubuque wahlert 
high school said they had engaged in sex with cushing the worker 
admitted paying one student for sex several times earlier this year 
the affidavit alleges 
cushing was released saturday on a 10000 bond a preliminary 
hearing was set for dec 30 
it was a total shock to us said the schools principal don 
miller 
although there was no evidence any students were forced to have 
sex in my mind these students are victims miller said they 
were victimized by someone in authority over them 
officials suspended cushing from his position in charge of 
audiovisual equipment after learning of the police investigation 
dec 8 he had been employed at the coeducational school for 16 
years 
assistant police chief terry lambert said that male students ran 
naked in electrical and heating tunnels in the schools basement as 
part of an initiation rite to a technical drawing seminar supervised 
by cushing 
a 14yearold freshman said cushing told him he had videotaped 
the seminar students with hidden cameras so they wouldnt tell 
according to court papers lambert estimated the initiation rite had 
been going on for the last six or seven years 
school administrators have called in mental health experts to 
counsel the students in cushings group 
just because were a community of believers doesnt mean were 
a community of saints miller said

sri lankans voted for a new president 
monday under tight security after a bloodsoaked campaign that left 
hundreds dead and normal life in tatters 
ethnic extremists of the peoples liberation front have vowed to 
disrupt the elections and have threatened to kill anyone who voted 
a big question mark was how many of this tropical islands 93 
million eligible voters would ignore the threats and go to the polls 
on the eve of the balloting the government decreed that people 
who intimidated others to prevent them from voting could face the 
death penalty 
troops and police took up positions throughout the island to 
ensure calm balloting 
polls opened under blue skies and balmy weather at 700 am 
830 pm est sunday and were to close at 4 pm 530 am est 
monday significant returns were not expected until tuesday 
prime minister ranasinghe premadasa was the candidate of the 
ruling united national party and mentor of president junius r 
jayewardene who is barred by the constitution from seeking a third 
term 
former prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike of the sri lanka 
freedom party was the main opposition candidate ossie 
abeygoonesekera also was running as the head of a coalition of four 
small leftist parties 
this is a battle between the ballot and the bullet premadasa 
said after casting his vote at the colombo municipal council 
reception hall the bullet must not win 
he predicted victory but said the margin would depend on the 
turnout 
the election was held amid mounting bloodshed caused by ethnic 
strife 
final days of the campaign were marked by waves of killings 
abductions and attacks on political rallies that disrupted normal 
life once famed as a tourist haven 
on the final weekend before the vote at least 25 people were 
killed including six who died when gunment burst into the home of a 
prominent opposition politician 
the peoples liberation front which is threatening to kill 
voters is a shadowy group of extremists from the majority buddhist 
sinhalese community upset by government concessions to minority 
hindu tamils 
tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent state in northern 
and eastern sri lanka also called for a boycott 
shops in colombo that normally would be open for christmas and 
new year shopping were shuttered sunday and traffic was light 
police speaking on condition of anonymity said that despite 
heightened security sinhalese extremists in the south killed four 
soldiers during the weekend blocked roads by chopping down trees 
and knocked down electricity poles 
local police blamed the peoples liberation front for sundays 
attack on a political meeting at the home of neville fernando in 
panadura nine miles south of colombo 
fernando a sinhalese used to be a member of jayewardenes party 
but he left it to work for mrs bandaranaikes party 
fernando was not hurt in the attack which left six people dead 
and six critically wounded panadura police said 
in a communique the government said any person who by words 
whether written or spoken or by signs or by any conduct compels 
induces or incites any other person to refrain from voting at the 
presidential elections shall be punishable with death or 
imprisonment for a period of not less than 10 years 
it also said security forces were instructed to use maximum 
force where necessary to enforce the decree 
the peoples liberation front is viewed as the biggest threat to 
the election it vowed to kill anyone who supported the government 
after jayewardene signed an indianbrokered accord granting some 
autonomy to the tamils 
the front also claims the government is incapable of conducting 
fair elections and it has attacked all parties participating in the 
election 
the government blames the front for the deaths of more than 650 
people mostly sinhalese who supported the government since the 
accord was signed july 29 1987 
the tamil insurrection has claimed at least 8500 lives since 
1983 when militants from the ethnic minority started attacking 
government troops and massacring sinhalese civilians 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of sri lankas population all three 
presidential candidates are sinhalese 
tamils comprise 18 percent 
the fighting is no longer a clearly defined conflict between 
sinhalese and tamils 
sinhalese are killing fellow sinhalese and rival tamil factions 
clash with each other and with indian peacekeeping forces trying to 
disarm them

of 100 residents authorities said two people were still 
unaccounted for at midevening 
the blaze in the fourstory morningside hotel apparently began on 
the third floor about 940 am and quickly spread the downtown

smoke poured from the rear of the lshaped brick building which 
also contains a music store and karate school the building was 
largely gutted and a wall collapsed 
i didnt even have time to grab my boots and my boots were 
right there by the door said helena mb telerado 59 a 
hairdresser who has lived in the hotel for 10 years

julius wood died in his fourthfloor apartment police said he was 
49 years old 
at midevening mayor joe kernan said that two people were still 
unaccountedfor but that authorities did not think they were 
victims 
we are hopeful and feel pretty good that there is no one left 
in the building but we cant say that with certainty until the 
search is completed said kernan 
taylor said the building was destroyed but had no estimate of the 
loss the 60 firefighters and 15 pieces of equipment called to the 
scene concentrated on rescuing residents before fighting the fire 
he said 
at one time the estimate of the number of unaaccountedfor was 
as high as 16 throughout the morning we had people call in or 
come down to the command post at a nearby church said lt richard 
kilgore public information officer for the police department 
officials at memorial hospital and st joseph medical center 
reported treating nine people four residents were admitted one of

the apartment next door white escaped without his possessions but 
was unharmed thats the only thing im happy about he said 
the desk clerk came by the door and knocked and said 
fire said jeannie skelton 34 who had lived at the 
morningside about 18 months when i went out into the hallway i 
did see smoke so then i knew it was the real thing and not a false 
alarm 
ms telerado said fire alarms were a frequent occurrence and 
said she initially ignored the warnings of a maintenance man who 
pounded on hallway walls and yelled that there was a fire an alarm 
began ringing but stopped after about five minutes she said other 
residents too may have been slow to learn of the danger or respond 
to warnings she said 
about 60 firefighters began a roombyroom search of the hotel 
after the fire was extinguished taylor said two suffered minor 
injuries 
many residents fled shoeless and in nightclothes said the rev 
steven newton director of a newly opened homeless center who took 
in 56 morningside residents most depend on social security benefits 
or other limited incomes and paid as little as 135 a month for 
rooms according to newton and some residents 
they were in the last kind of housing you can get before the 
streets said newton were not talking about condominiums being 
burned out 
word of the fire brought an outpouring of food clothing gifts 
and money to the homeless center showing a personal check made out 
to the center for 1000 center volunteer david t link said 
somebody just walked in off the street with that

volunteers hoping to build durable plastic 
tents for the earthquake victims in armenia had another setback 
sunday when red tape problems kept them off a soviet transport 
plane pushing back their scheduled departure three more days 
anthony seraphin president of protectaboat and film 
applicators of north america which came up with the idea for the 
quicktobuild shelters said his team now plans to leave from miami 
on wednesday night on the first leg of a trip to the soviet union 
the team also has been reduced from its originally planned 17 
members after the soviets gave permission for only 12 to enter 
union carbide corp spokesman john p yimoyines said carbide is 
paying the estimated 100000 cost of the effort and makes the resin 
used in the plastic housing material 
the crew will take 200000 square feet of resinbased plastic 
film and 24000 feet of galvanized steel piping enough to make 100 
tents yimoyines said 
the tents are constructed by building frames out of steel and 
then shrinkwrapping plastic around them using a propane heat gun 
seraphin said it takes about two hours to build a tent that can 
house 30 people and includes doors windows and vents the tents can 
last two years 
the team had hoped to board a soviet il76 transport sunday but 
the group could not get state department approval for their trip in 
time the men said before that the air national guard had offered 
to transport the crew and their equipment if the defense department 
would ok the flight but the pentagon said friday it would have to 
forward the request to the state department for its approval this 
week 
i hope this one is for real yimoyines said of wednesdays 
planned flight i think it is because we even have flight numbers 
this time 
the travel plans are being made by the washington dcbased 
armenian relief society seraphin said a society spokesman greg 
beadian said he would not release details of the plans until late 
monday after informing all the donors 
continental airlines will fly the team and the tentmaking 
equipment from newark nj to miami yimoyines said 
the team intends to build five to 10 shelters in towns in the 
quake area where at least 55000 were killed and 500000 left 
homeless by the dec 7 earthquake seraphin said 
then when we get back well be raising money to send more 
material over there so they can do it themselves he said 
the team will not return before christmas but yimoyines said he 
cant imagine a better place to be for the holiday 
thats the reason were all going he said adding that the 
group was taking a small christmas tree its mostly guys who see 
a chance to help

the quebec government said sunday it 
will keep a partial prohibition on nonfrench store signs even 
though the nations highest court struck down the ban 
the issue has threatened to deepen divisions once again between 
the englishspeaking minority and the frenchspeaking majority of 
this eastern canadian province 
quebecs government decided sunday to override provincial and 
federal charters of rights to keep the ban on outdoor signs 
however the compromise proposal would allow merchants to post 
bilingual signs indoors 
to govern is to choose quebec premier robert bourassa told a 
sunday afternoon news conference broadcast live on quebec television 
and radio we are not happy to impose that solution 
the provincial government was reacting to a ruling thursday by 
the supreme court of canada which struck down quebecs frenchonly 
sign law 
the issue has posed the most difficult political test for 
bourassa since the election of his liberal party three years ago 
the courts decision was followed by a hectic weekend of meetings 
of political leaders and provincial cabinet members bourassa fought 
to block a damaging split in the party and a walkout by 
englishspeaking members 
the provincial government is asking an enormous concession 
from the provinces english speakers bourassa said sunday but he 
said frenchspeaking quebecers are still too insecure about the 
future of their language for the provincial government to allow 
bilingual signs outside stores 
opposition parti quebecois house leader guy chevrette denounced 
the new plan saying the provincial government has taken the most 
pernicious and hypocritical route to the anglicization of 
quebec the party once championed a movement for quebec 
independence from canada but it has moderated those views in recent 
years 
royal orr president of the englishrights lobby alliance 
quebec also condemned the decision which overrides linguistic 
freedoms established in quebecs own charter of rights 
you and your government are without principle without the 
courage to do what is right and without the quality and integrity 
of leadership which command respect he said 
orr said the quebec governments moral convictions should have 
outweighed its legal right to use the notwithstanding clauses in 
the two rights charters 
those clauses in the federal and quebec charters allow the 
province to override freedomofexpression sections in both 
documents 
bourassa wanted to work out a compromise that would please 
hardline elements in his caucus who wanted no changes in the sign 
law as well as englishspeakers who urged the provincial government 
to live up to a 1985 electoral pledge to allow bilingual signs both 
inside and outside stores 
bourassa whose liberals lost power to the parti quebecois in 
1976 partly because of language issue held out hope that one day 
there might be no ban on languages other than french on outside 
commercial signs but he added i cannot commit myself to a 
calendar 
he also delivered an emotional appeal to englishspeaking members 
of his caucus to remain in his government saying we need you 
provincial government leaders say they will quickly put forward 
new legislation to turn the proposed partial ban into law

two retailers leaders in different aspects 
of the home entertainment industry have joined forces to offer 
consumers a rare onestop music video and electronics center under 
the same roof 
good guys inc sellers of hardware such as televisions and vcrs 
and tower records inc marketers of software like compact discs 
records and tapes signed a lease linking both stores inside the 
same building at the stonestown galleria 
ive been retailing since i was 18 and ive never heard of two 
retailers occupying the same lease said kevin mcneill manager of 
the good guys store at stonestown its so logical the software 
and the hardware of our industry in one building it makes sense 
at the stonestown galleria the innovation of the arrangement 
becomes quickly obvious when shoppers view the stores names printed 
in bold red letters on separate sides of the old i magnin building 
inside good guys merchandise spreads across 18000 square feet 
on the first floor while tower records takes up another 18000 
square feet on the second floor 
the two stores are linked by escalator and elevator and they 
also share a freight elevator 
its working well for both of us so far said good guys 
president ron unkefer the good guys store at stonestown opened 
three months prior to tower records opening 
the arrangement has also worked thus far for tower although it 
will be about a year before the stores performance can be properly 
evaluated said mike sullivan vice president 
sacramentobased tower records is a 380 million chain with 50 
stores in the united states and eight overseas the good guys is a 
17store 150 million chain based in burlingame 
tower records opened its stonestown store in late november and 
the good guys store manager said he noticed an immediate impact on 
sales during the first weekend 
ive seen an amazing change in the traffic pattern said 
mcneill whos managed five good guys stores we probably saw 
double what weve been seeing and weve been here since august 
he said his salesmen advise customers who purchase hardware at 
the good guys to go upstairs and buy the software at tower records 
so they can immediately try out their product he added that 
customers are crossshopping or browsing from store to store 
linking the two stores resulted almost by accident said unkefer 
the good guys had located the prospective property but the old i 
magnin building was too large to develop and the landlord only 
wanted one entrance 
unkefer said he decided to proceed with the sharedleased plan 
since the good guys and tower records already had a good 
relationship they are neighbors in a number of communities and 
tower president russ solomon sits on the good guys board of 
directors 
a multimilliondollar restoration of the building and about a 
year of planning went into the project at stonestown galleria a 
sprawling shopping center on the southwestern corner of the city 
near san francisco state university 
unkefer said there are no plans for similar ventures in the 
future but were both viewing this as a test that we 
certainly could do again in other cities and other markets 
in any case unkefer said customers can only benefit from such 
sharedlease arrangements 
everything thats in the building is fun to buy its onestop 
shopping for home entertainment he said

the nations major airlines are ready to end their 
triple mileage programs but only if all the carriers do so 
according to some airline officials 
the programs in which airlines give frequent fliers three miles 
of credit for each mile they fly have been popular with the flying 
public and costly for the major carriers 
delta air lines introduced triple mileage about a year ago and 
the others quickly followed suit 
triple miles truly sent a shock through the airline industry 
and through american airlines michael gunn americans senior 
vice president of marketing told the dallas morning news it was 
fundamentally unsound from an economic standpoint 
deltas frequent flier membership increased by 25 million during 
1988 and americans jumped by 15 million the morning news 
reported in sundays editions 
last april several carriers announced changes that effectively 
pulled in the reins on free flying and airlines could be ready now 
to eliminate the triple mileage programs entirely some experts say 
triple miles will pass into legend on dec 31st matt 
guilfoyle deltas director of consumer marketing said last week 
as delta proved a year ago only one airline has to break away 
from the herd to start a stampede 
there will be a move to slowly and i mean slowly tighten 
the use of frequent flier mileage said paul karos an airline 
analyst with first boston corp but the airlines arent going to 
be able to get rid of the programs totally nor would they want to 
theyre a good marketing tool 
analysts estimate that the potential cost of all frequent flier 
miles when translated into free tickets and service upgrades 
could approach 1 billion as much as half of that total is 
attributable to triple mileage bonuses 
at the same time it appears increasingly likely that the 
organization that sets accounting standards for us businesses the 
american institute of certified public accountants will soon 
require airlines to list their potential frequent flier liabilities 
on their balance sheets 
in response airlines are likely to find ways to remove the 
mileage awards from their books by putting an expiration date on 
miles already earned or by putting a time limit on the use of future 
mileage awards 
airlines also are increasing the use of blackout dates 
popular travel periods when tickets obtained as frequent flier 
awards cannot be used and capacity control with capacity control 
airlines limit the number of seats on each flight to be given away 
to frequent fliers

the earnings outlook for the newspaper business 
is expected to brighten next year despite what may be a shaky start 
provided the economy avoids falling into a recession 
that appeared to be the consensus among newspaper executives and 
securities analysts who attended last weeks painewebber inc media 
conference 
we are at the bottom of a trough right now and after a tough 
first quarter earnings should improve said edward atorino who 
follows the media business for the investment firm smith barney 
harris upham amp co 
atorino said the newspaper companies should post earnings gains 
from operations for all of 1989 that should average about 7 percent 
to 8 percent compared with flat to lower performances in 1988 
j kendrick noble the media analyst for painewebber and the 
organizer of the 16th annual conference said earnings may grow 10 
percent next year mainly due to improved operating results 
noble said the major newspaper companies were able to post 10 
percent earnings gains in 1988 but said most of the improvement was 
due to the lower corporate tax rate while operating results were 
steady 
knight ridder inc gannett co and new york times co for 
instance each said they expected lower earnings in the first 
quarter of 1989 but improvement for the rest of the year dow jones 
amp co expects improved results at all of its operations next year 
barring a recession and timesmirror co said costcontainment 
programs will help it post modest gains in 1989 
atorino said the main reason most newspaper companies expect a 
tough first quarter is that the first three months of 1988 were 
unusually strong 
but the performance at most newspaper companies for the rest of 
the year fell off sharply because of a decline in retail advertising 
and increases in newsprint costs 
the decline in retail advertising a major contributor to most 
newspapers revenue has been blamed on consolidation in the 
retailing business resistance to last springs womens fashions and 
possibly greater selectivity by consumers in a delayed response to 
the october 1987 stock market crash 
atorino noted that newspaper profits were pressured by two 
increases in 18 months in newsprint prices which represents a 
significant cost to publishers 
he said the combination of lower ad revenue and higher newsprint 
costs produced the most difficult year in 10 years for the 
newspaper business 
but atorino and noble said that after getting past the first 
quarter newspaper executives have good reason to be optimistic 
about the year 
atorino said advertising revenue for newpapers should rise by 
about 6 percent next year up from about 4 percent in 1988 
noble expects classified advertising will grow at a slower pace 
than this year retail advertising should be about the same and 
national advertising in newspapers should pick up after no growth 
this year he expects little change in overall ad revenue growth 
but noble said he expects a 6 percent increase in circulation 
revenue reflecting 1 percent real growth and rate hikes of about 5 
percent 
on the cost side the analysts said newspapers should benefit 
from costcontainment programs already in place modest growth in 
labor costs and smaller increases if any in newsprint prices 
noble said the industry has had to absorb newsprint price hikes 
averaging 10 percent over the past two years but noted that there 
are some doubts that the 45 percent hike posted by some major 
producers for early 1989 will in fact take effect 
labor costs on the other hand should rise by a modest 3 percent 
to 4 percent noble said 
the net result atorino said is that the combination of slightly 
improved ad revenue higher circulation revenue and slow growth in 
labor and newsprint costs should lead to improving earnings 
there is almost unanimous hope that business will be better in 
89 he said

reconstruction following the aug 20 ceasefire in its gulf war with 
iraq 
the koohe mand discovery will increase irans current estimated 
oil reserves of 93 billion barrels by more than 10 percent 
aqazadeh said that in addition to oil a recent discovery of 
vast deposits of natural gas in assaluyeh will boost our 
natural gas reserves substantially 
the iranian oil ministry disclosed in august that the gas find 
about 44 miles southeast of the big kangannar gas fields in the 
central gulf has a production capacity of 26 million cubic meters a 
day 
there might be further reserves deeper down aqazadeh noted 
irans total gas reserves are estimated at more than 13 trillion 
cubic meters 
aqazadeh said additional oil exploration projects were underway 
in the caspian sea in northern iran as well as in the gulf the 
iranians are likely to develop caspian fields in cooperation with 
the soviet union 
he said work on the bottom of the caspian sea has also been 
completed and we hope to have a rig in place by next year in 
cooperation with the soviets soon after that we hope to start our 
drilling operations there 
aqazadeh also referred to another recent oil find in kheyrabad in 
central fars province southeast of shiraz 
preliminary exploration has put the capacity of the kheyrabad 
find at 200 million barrels of oil a day he said due to the 
high pressure of the deposits there the first well should yield 
about 400000 barrels of oil a day
