a former stockbroker who bilked his golf buddies 
and other associates of more than 2 million was sentenced monday 
to five years in prison after pleading guilty to federal mail fraud 
and other charges 
us district court judge edward harrington sentenced walter f 
curran a former stockbroker with dean witter reynolds inc to two 
concurrent fiveyear terms followed by five years probation for 
mail and bank fraud 
a condition of his probation is that curran reimburse his 
victims 
harrington called the crime deliberate and calculated fraud 
it was fraud of enormous proportions he said one of the 
predominant motivations was excess greed 
curran 47 who pleaded guilty to 13 counts of mail fraud and 
bank fraud told the court he understood the serious nature of his 
crime 
its been a very trying period for everyone concerned with 
this he said 
curran also pleaded guilty to one count of violating currency 
transaction reporting laws for which he received a 13month 
sentence to be served concurrently with the other sentences that 
charge was filed in new york after curran was found to be carrying 
132000 in cash when he was arrested at the canadian border last 
february 
as part of his sentence curran was ordered to pay more than 
260000 to the bank of boston corp for overdrawing money in a 
series of checking transactions 
curran was suspended from dean witter reynolds in february 1989 
when he was arrested in connection with the disappearance of 239 
million he had convinced friends and associates to invest in his 
personal account instead of with dean witter 
defense attorney robert cordy described the broker from 
wellesley as a decent and engaging man probably the most 
generous person i have ever met who became desperate when he 
could not fulfill promises he had made to his investors 
starting in april 1981 curran solicited money from eight 
people including two golfing companions as well as his accountant 
and his lawyer at the time cordy said 
cordy said curran promised them interest payments of 20 percent 
if they invested in a deferred compensation account in his name 
instead however over the eight years curran invested 36 million 
in the stock market and other ventures 
during that time the funds suffered ups and downs but when the 
market collapsed on black monday in october 1987 curran lost his 
investors money as well as much of his own cordy said 
he had tried everything from gambling to long shots cordy 
said eventually when everything came crashing down there was no 
way he could continue to juggle the balls and get the money back 
faced with huge losses curran fled to canada and when he 
disappeared his scheme came to light he surrendered to 
authorities in massena ny

the reinstatement of the african 
national congress has brought little joy or hope to south africas 
black townships and activists say it wont change the harsh lives 
of millions of poor blacks 
president fw de klerks announcement friday that the anc and 
other antigovernment groups no longer will be banned along with 
other reforms prompted few celebrations in the sprawling townships 
while many foreign leaders hailed de klerks pronouncements 
just a few thousand of the countrys 28 million blacks marched or 
celebrated in most cities 
while applauding de klerks call for talks to resolve south 
africas racial problems antiapartheid leaders said the 
concessions would change little in the short term 
they said black asian and mixedrace south africans want total 
equality and full democracy immediately with no special privileges 
for whites de klerk hopes to preserve at least some white power 
and little will change for most blacks the activists say 
most of us realized that the speech did not change a single 
bit of the political realities and the living realities of our 
people the rev allan boesak said in an interview 
boesak a mixedrace clergyman and prominent antiapartheid 
leader said the changes would not ease the plight of millions of 
blacks who live in shantytowns struggling to feed and clothe their 
families 
there is no reason to celebrate while most nonwhites still face 
chronic unemployment malnutrition and poor education and health 
facilities he said 
the realities of apartheid will take away what joy or 
gratitude the people may have he said 
de klerks speech prompted no major celebrations in soweto the 
main black township outside johannesburg with a population of 25 
million 
in cape town a few hundred people many of them children 
attended a township victory celebration 
boesak said nonwhites do not trust the government after years 
of repression and would have little faith in its statements until 
they see real change in their lives 
many apartheid laws enforcing the separation of the races 
remain in effect and power and privilege are still vested in the 
hands of the white minority 
its going to take 10 to 15 years to make south africa nice 
said a young anc activist taking part in a protest in cape town he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
activists said the modest black turnout to celebrate de klerks 
speech also reflected a lack of political organization and 
widespread apathy among many blacks that must be changed 
celebrations last year to mark the release from prison of walter 
sisulu and other senior anc leaders failed to fill a 70000seat 
stadium in soweto 
too many of the people are afraid or do not care said a 
labor union official who also insisted on not being identified 
while de klerk promised to end apartheid legislation allowing 
segregation of public facilities government ministers ruled out 
scrapping other apartheid laws at this time 
laws segregating residential areas and requiring south africans 
to register by race will be retained for now the ministers say 
they say the government still strongly supports the right of ethnic 
groups to live separately 
de klerk has spoken out against the concept of black majority 
rule and said repeal of apartheid laws would have to be negotiated 
as part of an overall settlement 
when you see through this maze of excitement over the 
speech apartheid is still very much intact said eugene nyati 
a political analyst at the center of african studies 
antiapartheid leaders say de klerk and his national party 
remain committed to preserving a special status for whites that 
would give them an indefinite hold on power 
it is unlikely that the promised land of a nonracial 
democracy will be reached before at best the second half of this 
decade said sampie terreblanche an opposition democratic party 
analyst 
black labor leaders are playing down de klerks reforms noting 
that the government has not ended the 3yearold state of 
emergency which gives police wide powers to curb dissent 
the people are not satisfied said one union leader who 
refused to be identified 
de klerk said he wanted to end the state of emergency as soon as 
possible but gave no date 
the government must prove its sincerity with rapid and massive 
change to end whiteminority rule and ease the plight of millions 
of poor blacks boesak said 
said the clergyman if mr de klerk really wants to give 
meaning to what he has said to give some meaning and direction 
to the grand vision he has painted he has to move very very 
quickly

a study of domestic violence in milwaukee 
concluded that police cannot rely on past abuse incidents to 
predict and prevent homicides in which a husband or wife kills a 
spouse 
the study conducted by the washingtonbased crime control 
institute found that previous domestic violence was reported in 
only one of 33 adult domestic homicides in milwaukee during a 
22month period from 1987 to 1989 
the study challenges previous research suggesting that most 
domestic homicides are foretold by domestic violence calls said 
lawrence w sherman director of the study for the crime control 
institute 
police chief phillip areola said the findings were unexpected 
and disappointing and would set back police efforts to improve 
the prevention of spouse killings 
police have long hoped for a reliable basis for predicting and 
preventing domestic homicide areola said unfortunately the 
crime control institute research suggests we have not developed the 
tools to do that particular job 
the study released sunday found a group of 1112 couples had an 
average of more than three incidents of violence per couple during 
the 22month study period but none resulted in homicide 
in contrast only one of the 33 domestic homicide cases involved 
a couple with a previous report of violence 
millions of dollars have been paid out by taxpayers and 
insurers in lawsuits all based on the theory that police can 
predict and prevent domestic homicide sherman said according 
to the milwaukee evidence that theory is wrong 
its almost a suggestion that homicide and assault are two 
different phenomenons sherman added 
joseph weis a sociology professor and director of the center 
for law and justice at the university of washington said he isnt 
surprised by the studys findings 
we arent really very good at predicting any kind of crime on 
a regular basis weis said we cant tell you whether john or 
joe or jane will kill their spouse even if there is a history 
of violence 
but carey tradewell executive director of the milwaukee womens 
center said people who work with domestic violence cases do see a 
pattern 
what we see is that the longer women and men stay in a 
relationship where theres violence without any intervention there 
is repeated violence and the violence is more severe 
sherman said his data shows no evidence to support tradewells 
observation 
the findings contradict an earlier study conducted by the kansas 
city police department which found that 90 percent of domestic 
homicides had been preceded by a disturbance call at the address of 
either the victim or the offender in a twoyear period before the 
homicide 
the study will be published later this year by the academy of 
criminal justice sciences and the anderson publishing co of 
cincinnati in a book titled redefining crime responses to woman 
battering

a woman is fuming because school officials 
suspended her 8yearold daughter for three days for bringing an 
unopened can of beer to showandtell 
i am furious melissa woodfin said monday i have no 
problem with them having a policy but you cant treat a 
thirdgrader the way you would a teenager 
mrs woodfins daughter haley also must undergo counseling for 
bringing the can of billy beer to school last week 
the beer named for president carters late brother is no 
longer made and unopened cans are considered collectors items 
officials at skipwith elementary school in suburban henrico 
county said the suspension is consistent with their strict drug and 
substance abuse policy 
superintendent william c bosher jr acknowledged that the 
suspension of an elementary school pupil is highly unusual but he 
said the issue is serious 
suspending young people is not what we are about bosher 
said but we want to help young people understand that alcohol 
and drugs are not appropriate 
but mrs woodfin said the punishment did not fit the crime 
my daughter has been treated unfairly she said she has 
lost three days of school with no right to make up the work 
according to the policy 
mrs woodfin said her daughter removed the can of beer from a 
display case at home and took it to school 
she took it for showandtell mrs woodfin said she 
didnt run into a closet and pop it open 
in addition to the suspension police were notified that the 
girl was in illegal possession of an alcoholic beverage 
sgt james price said the girl would be referred to juvenile 
proceedings which is nothing more than a counseling session 
mrs woodfin said the can of billy beer was returned to her by 
police and is back in the display case where it will remain 
haley was back in school monday after serving her suspension

after an hour of slaving over a hot grill john 
sullivans fourthgrade class was ready to dig into the sumptuous 
meal of steak frites emince de volaille friture and floating 
island they had just prepared 
impressed well dont be translated thats a simple fare of 
steak and fries fried chicken strips and carameltopped meringue 
and ok they didnt exactly slave over anything but they did 
giggle 
oh yuck i think i squeezed it too hard said eric mattes 
9 who had a goopy glob of egg dripping down his hand 
the youngster admitted hes never separated eggs before but 
then thats what this trip was all about 
its a real world lesson i think said sullivan who 
brought 18 pupils from the dalton school a private school on 
manhattans upper east side to the la cite restaurant in 
rockefeller center for monday mornings outing 
they get to find out how things work in a restaurant in a 
major city said sullivan adding its the most exciting field 
trip ive ever been on 
the trip was courtesy of la cites owner alan stillman who is 
known to the dalton school kids simply as michaels dad 
michael appeared delighted to share his kitchen expertise with 
his schoolmates he joined them in taking turns learning how to 
bread fry and grill foods and more important to this crowd whip 
up a little dessert 
the egg separating proved a tad tricky for the kids most of 
whom ended up crushing the egg entirely or dumping the yolk in with 
what was supposed to be pristine egg whites 
now youve got to go fish pastry chef julie marx told one 
after another showing them how to dip a demolished egg shell into 
the blender to scoop up the unwanted yellow yolk 
is this high in cholesterol how come its ok to eat this 
when its cooked and not now the kids fired at marx as she 
whipped the egg white and sugar mixture into a fluffy white mound 
no one asked about calories 
actually jonathan block 9 considers himself a 
fairtomiddling dessert maker i make stuff a lot he said 
licking meringue from his fingers my favorite dessert is ice 
cream bananas chocolate sauce cake cookies and brownies 
together 
meanwhile at the other end of the kitchen others were busy 
dipping dredging and grilling the meal the kids prepared costs 
2850 including a salad and soft drink 
the best part of the trip 
eating of course 
we never get anything like this at school said betsy 
mallow 9 
she rated the chicken better than the fast food kind and a lot 
better than her moms

chippewa indians seeking unlimited access 
to about 18 million acres of forest should be free to harvest 
timber without government regulation under 19thcentury treaties a 
chippewa lawyer told a federal judge monday 
lawyers for several northern wisconsin counties asked us 
district judge barbara crabb to allow government regulation of the 
indians activities to preserve timber resources 
david siegler who represents the chippewas bad river band 
said on the opening day of a trial to decide the matter that the 
chippewa do not believe all timber regulations issued by counties 
are necessary to avoid deterioration of the forest land at stake in 
the case 
siegler also told the judge the chippewa believe the land 
belongs to them 
the forests involved in the case are managed by counties which 
make about 3 million annually from timber sales 
it doesnt make sense to make the indians pay for something 
that is theirs siegler said 
wisconsins six chippewa bands retain the right to hunt fish 
gather food and cut timber under courtaffirmed treaties that ceded 
northern wisconsin to the federal government 
federal courts have upheld the treaties in rulings dating to 
1983 in the case initiated by the chippewa the previous court 
rulings left it up to ms crabb to decide how the land should be 
managed 
several other issues relating to the treaties including deer 
and bear hunting are still pending others such as tribal fishing 
and wild rice gathering have been settled 
we will prove that our regulations are necessary for 
preserving the timber resources of northern wisconsin counties 
attorney thomas mcnulty who represents the counties told the 
judge 
the trial is expected to last several weeks 
about eight counties are involved in the timber case though 28 
counties will be affected by the outcome 
assistant attorney general lisa levin said the state does not 
plan to charge the indians a user fee but seeks a ruling on 
whether the indians could hire nonindians to work for their timber 
harvest operations 
she said the indians want to expand the scope of the treaty 
rights to nonindians 
crabb must decide to what degree county state and federal 
governments can regulate the chippewas timber cutting in forests 
also used by the paper industry in wisconsin 
tribal lawyers have argued the treaties allow the chippewa 
unlimited access to cut timber without the regulations or user fees 
imposed on nonindian loggers and that they should have first 
access to all the timber they can cut in county and statemanaged 
forests 
county officials claim the forests might be destroyed if user 
fees are waived for the indians since the money is used to replant 
trees and care for the land 
were just saying that the indians should abide by the same 
regulations as everyone else said loren sloan of the wisconsin 
counties forest association 
if they dont pay to protect our forests the taxpayers are 
going to have to pay for the indians to come in and harvest timber 
for free sloan said 
forest products manufacturers employ about 77000 people and 
produce about 8 billion worth of products annually in wisconsin 
overall the state department of development reported 
unemployment rates on most of the six chippewa reservations in 
wisconsin exceed 50 percent and indians are looking to logging as a 
way to boost their economies siegler said

a new prosecutor was named monday to retry 
raymond buckey on molestation and conspiracy charges in the 
mcmartin preschool case and district attorney ira reiner said many 
of the charges could be dropped 
deputy district attorney joe martinez replaced lael rubin and 
roger gunson according to a statement issued by reiners office 
rubin and gunson prosecuted buckey 31 and his 63yearold 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey on molestation and conspiracy 
charges a superior court jury acquitted the pair last month of 52 
counts but deadlocked on 13 additional counts against raymond 
buckey 
superior court judge william pounders scheduled a new trial for 
march 9 
reiner said monday the number of charges against buckey probably 
would be reduced because at least two potential witnesses both 
children have balked at the prospect of taking the stand 
the prosecution may ask that up to eight of the 13 counts be 
dismissed he said 
his office listed 17 potential witnesses for the trial 
including all five children named in the charges relatives and 
doctors 
reiner said the list could change 
of the five children named in the remaining counts two did not 
testify at the original trial the youngsters now range in age from 
11 to 14 
if convicted on all 13 counts the maximum sentence buckey could 
receive would be 36 years in prison reiner said 
if convicted of fewer charges buckey could go free because he 
already spent five years behind bars the equivalent of a 10year 
sentence while awaiting trial 
buckey was released on his own recognizance pending the new 
trial 
pounders has said the facts involved in the remaining 13 counts 
mitigate in favor of a long second trial but reiner said 
monday his office hoped to try the case in three months 
defense attorneys and parents of children who attended the 
manhattan beach preschool criticized rubin and gunsons handling of 
the original case the longest costliest criminal proceeding in 
us history 
both rubin and gunson requested reassignment before verdicts 
were announced last month they will assist martinez in the 
transition reiner said

the search for the next great verdi soprano 
resumed at the metropolitan opera as susan dunn a rising young 
american star made her debut in il trovatore 
she may not yet be the answer to an opera lovers prayers but 
on the strength of her performance monday night the arkansas 
native is a force to be reckoned with for some time to come 
in the grueling role of leonora dunn displayed a voice of 
considerable power beauty and agility and yet she made a 
curiously muted impression never quite throwing herself into the 
frenzy of the occasion when verdi demanded it perhaps it was the 
difficulty she was having in her upper register where some high 
notes seemed forced and one or two were omitted entirely 
even with that qualification for sheer vocal luster she has the 
edge over aprile millo another young american who has been laying 
claim to the heavy verdi roles once owned by the likes of leontyne 
price and zinka milanov another aspirant alessandra marc made a 
debut earlier this season in aida showing phenomenal potential 
and a lot of unresolved vocal problems 
dunns was not the only debut of note monday night as the 
villainous count di luna paolo gavanelli a young italian 
baritone made an unscheduled debut replacing the hungarian lajos 
miller who had fallen ill gavanelli made a strong impression his 
mediumsize voice brimming with vigor 
the conductor also was new to the met rico saccani from 
arizona not italy as the name might suggest led a peppy and 
idiomatic performance 
it may sound like a bonus but it wasnt that the met presented 
not one but two tenors in the part of manrico ermanno mauro begged 
off halfway through complaining of tracheitis franco bonanome 
who took over sounded as if he might be headed for his sick bed as 
well by the time the night was out 
the finest singer on stage was mezzo dolora zajick a powerhouse 
who did full justice to the juicy role of the mad gypsy azucena 
whether singing softly or soaring above the orchestra she was 
thrilling 
trovatore is famous for having one of the silliest plots in 
all opera and the mets production new a few years back is 
almost as silly the sets by ezio frigerio consist mainly of an 
interminable set of steps decorated by nownotorious shiny black 
movable pillars that rearrange themselves during scene changes

the covenant house shelter for runaways conceded 
monday that it provided a dead boys identity to a former male 
prostitute but refused to say how it obtained copies of the boys 
vital records 
in another development the new york times reported that roman 
catholic church officials were investigating allegations by a 
second man who says he had a sexual relationship with the rev 
bruce ritter who founded covenant house 
darryl j bassile 31 of ithaca ny told the times in a 
report published tuesday that he met ritter in april 1973 when he 
entered a covenant house intake center at age 14 bassile said that 
during his third visit with ritter the priest began fondling him 
and they had sex 
bassiles accusations are being reviewed this week by a panel 
convened by the franciscans the order to which ritter belongs the 
times said 
ritter said he remembered meeting bassile only in passing and 
called the allegations garbage 
only a minors parents their lawyer or someone with a proven 
legal interest can legally obtain birth certificate copies state 
officials said but an attorney for ritter maintained no law was 
broken 
the disclosure put a new twist in the allegations against ritter 
by the former prostitute kevin kite who has alleged that ritter 
gave him money housing and gifts in exchange for sex 
ritter has denied the accusations and kites father has 
described him as an emotionally troubled liar manhattan 
prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating the use of 
covenant house finances 
covenant house founded in new york in 1968 manages 17 shelters 
with more than 2000 beds in the united states toronto and latin 
america directly serving about 25000 young people annually its 
85 million annual budget comes mainly from private donations 
ritter has said he tried to help kite get off the streets even 
giving him a new name to protect him from his former prostitution 
ring 
kite was told by a covenant house official that warner was a 
child from upstate jamestown who died at age 10 from cancer the 
new york post reported monday kite said he was also given warners 
baptismal certificate and blank social security and passport 
application forms the post reported 
betty anne warner expressed shock in a telephone interview at 
the use of her sons name saying she and her husband had never 
been asked 
when i first heard it i thought it was a joke she said 
i thought oh golly whats happening in this cruel world 
mrs warner said she and her husband knew nothing of the matter 
until they learned of it from a reporter last week she said they 
contacted the fbi and have been interviewed by a manhattan 
prosecutor 
timothy warner died of leukemia in 1980 it was unclear how 
covenant house may have obtained copies of his birth record and his 
baptismal certificate mrs warner said she has the originals 
covenant house said in a brief statement that it was deeply 
sorry that the warners have been hurt in this way we never 
imagined the warners would be hurt 
the statement did not say how the identity was obtained bill 
mcandrew a covenant house spokesman said it had no further 
comment 
stanley arkin ritters lawyer said earlier monday that he did 
not know if timothy warners name and records were used but 
maintained that it is legal to use such records so long as it is 
not for illegal purposes

a woman filed a 20 million negligence 
lawsuit monday against a japanese manufacturer of ltryptophan a 
dietary supplement linked to a rare and potentially fatal blood 
disorder 
helen jones 52 of portland claimed in the lawsuit filed in 
multnomah county circuit court that the showa denko company was 
negligent in manufacturing ltryptophan leading her to suffer 
eosinophilia myalgia syndrome 
the rare disease is characterized by abnormal levels of 
eosinophils a type of white blood cell victims complain of severe 
muscle pain weakness and fatigue swelling in the arms legs and 
face fevers rashes and in some cases breathing disorders 
ltryptophan is an amino acid that has been sold over the 
counter as a nutritional supplement and a sleep aid for decades 
without harmful effects 
imports of ltryptophan were halted in december after the number 
of eosinophilia myalgia syndrome cases began mounting 
by the end of january nearly 1200 cases of the disease had 
been reported nationally with at least a dozen deaths attributed 
to it according to officials with the national centers for disease 
control 
jones said in her lawsuit that showa denko has refused to 
cooperate with us health authorities displaying callous 
disregard for the rights and health of plaintiff and all the other 
victims of ltryptophan in oregon and elsewhere in the united 
states 
jones a forklift driver claimed in her lawsuit that her health 
is worsening and that other victims of the syndrome also suffer 
deteriorating health 
dr david fleming deputy state epidemiologist said in december 
that the condition of many eosinophilia myalgia syndrome victims 
did not improve quickly after they stopped taking the dietary 
supplement containing ltryptophan 
cdc doctors in atlanta say there is no effective treatment for 
eosinophilia myalgia syndrome and they have nearly ruled out the 
possibility that some unknown ingredient contaminated capsules or 
pills containing ltryptophan 
dr edwin m kilbourne who is leading the cdc investigation 
has said ltryptophan itself might be causing the disease although 
ltryptophan manufactured by other companies apparently has not 
triggered it 
jones attorney gayle troutwine said showa denko is the 
sixthlargest petrochemical manufacturer in japan with profits of 
nearly 12 billion last year

in an attack that appeared 
premeditated about 200 youths in a troubled largely black 
district of liverpool rammed a police patrol car with a stolen car 
then hurled stones at police authorities said 
the youths also set fire to private cars in monday nights 
rioting and threw stones at firefighters who arrived to battle the 
blazes the police said 
the district toxteth was the scene of widespread rioting in 
1981 and was among three largely black innercity districts 
including handsworth in birmingham in central england and tottenham 
in london hit by riots in the fall of 1985 
police refused to speculate on the cause of monday nights 
violence in the northwestern port city 
they said in a statement that trouble flared when white officers 
went to investigate reports of black youths in toxteth arming 
themselves with bricks 
two officers who arrived in a patrol car had the car repeatedly 
rammed by a stolen car and faced a barrage of rocks the statement 
said it said police believed the attack was premeditated 
the statement said two police vans were also damaged in the 
violence and three privately owned autos set on fire it said the 
youths threw stones at firemen who arrived to put out the flames 
police reinforcements arrived and drove the attackers off while 
a police helicopter with a powerful spotlight flew overhead 
one police officer was reported to have received a minor eye 
injury when hit by a stone 
police said nobody was arrested 
superintendent bernard keegan subdivisional police commander 
for toxteth said i appeal to all parents teachers and local 
community leaders to help me in preventing this outrageous behavior 
by misguided youths 
in the violence in 1981 and 1985 black youths said the cause 
was police harassment drug dealing and other street crime is 
widespread in the area and there is often violence when police 
arrest suspects 
social workers say the underlying causes of the rioting in 1981 
and 1985 were high unemployment among young blacks poor housing 
and other social ills

since october workers have been grinding 
140 tons of mulch a day from limbs and trees felled by hurricane 
hugo 
theres so much mulch mecklenburg county is giving it away 
so much one huge pile caught fire from spontaneous combustion 
13 days ago and is still burning officials said 
come and get it said bill warren county operations 
supervisor for recycling were grinding more than we can give 
away 
for gardeners the woody pulp is ideal for landscaping it keeps 
moisture in and weeds out as the mulch decays it enriches the 
soil 
the county once charged 15 a pickup load but until all hugo 
debris is ground up the stuff is free for the taking 
after four months the county has ground up only onefifth of 
hugos debris the task probably will continue through autumn said 
fred remington division manager of recycling mulch will then go 
back on sale as part of the countys recycling program

some might have thought the army had gone hip 
when us troops started blasting rock n roll music toward the 
vatican embassy in panama city to encourage gen manuel antonio 
noriegas eviction in december 
but the army brass in washington apparently wasnt too sure what 
the guys were doing down there at least according to a list the 
pentagon provided later of the songs that deafened the panama city 
neighborhood 
in citing just a few of the songs played on loudspeakers outside 
the vatican embassy army lt col fred l serene jr got either 
the name of the song or the musicians wrong 
serene a congressional coordinator provided the list in a 
letter to rep stan parris rva who sought the information on 
behalf of a constituent a copy of the letter was obtained by the 
associated press 
in the letter serene wrote some of the numbers played 
included the smugglers blues sung by glen fry take the money 
and run by stevie miller i shot the sheriff by eric clampton 
free bird sung by the lynrd skynyrd band and nowhere to run 
to twisted sister was not one of the numbers played 
its really glenn frey steve miller eric clapton lynyrd 
skynyrd and the name of the martha and the vandellas song is 
nowhere to run twisted sister is a rock group not a song 
among the songs played but not mentioned by serene were i 
fought the law by the bobby fuller four voodoo chile by jimi 
hendrix and youre no good by linda ronstadt 
serene wrote that the 82nd airborne division band based at fort 
bragg nc was responsible for the music and he directed further 
inquiries to the bandmaster there but a sergeant with the 82nd 
airborne said he didnt think the band had anything to do with the 
music played over the loudspeakers and there was no immediate 
response from the bandmaster 
there also was no answer at serenes office monday afternoon 
noriega fled to the vatican embassy dec 24 five days after 
president bush ordered a us invasion that toppled noriegas 
government and sent him into hiding noriega gave himself up to 
us troops on jan 3 and he awaits trial in miami on drug 
trafficking charges 
the vatican embassy officials complained at the time about the 
loud music 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said then that the music 
was not a pressure tactic on the vatican but simply fairly 
standard practice to disrupt any attempt to eavesdrop on us 
officials conversations he said the same thing was done during 
the 1988 moscow summit 
of the choice of music fitzwater said im certainly glad to 
see the american sense of whimsy comes forward in this situation 
on dec 29 the troops turned the volume down so the music was 
no longer earsplitting but still loud the next day the music was 
turned off 
i am sympathetic to the papal nuncios plea that the music was 
keeping him awake while noriega slept a senior us embassy 
official in panama city said on dec 30 
bush said the same day i think it aggravated the people 
inside it has stopped it would have aggravated me ill tell you 
im not into rock country music maybe thats different

rep barney frank dmass says he told a 
group of marines to stop taunting homosexuals in a restaurant but 
did not report them to their superiors as reported by male 
prostitute stephen gobie in a magazine article 
frank also denies penthouse magazines report that he offered 
gobie 10000 to 12000 to help him get a new start in florida 
after they quarreled about the mans activities in franks rented 
townhouse 
meanwhile a campaign finance report released by franks office 
shows that he drew hefty contributions from individuals outside his 
district and political action committees while coping with a house 
ethics committee investigation of his relationship with gobie 
frank an acknowledged homosexual said monday yeah i was in 
mr henrys on capitol hill when some marines were hassling some 
guys and i went over and identified myself and told them to stop 
but i never gave their names to the marine corps because it 
was right after the lebanon bombing and i figured they were upset 
and id give them a pass on it he said 
a marine corps barracks in lebanon was bombed on oct 23 1983 
and 241 servicemen were killed 
gobie is quoted in the latest issue of penthouse as saying 
one day at a restaurant barney stood up to a bunch of marines 
razzing a table of gays they were sashaying around with limp 
wrists and laughing so barney says my names congressman barney 
frank do you guys have a problem were you harassing these men 
because they are gay he got their commanding officers name and 
reported them 
outside of the account of his encounter at the restaurant which 
he said was partially correct frank said virtually everything else 
about him that was attributed to gobie in the article was untrue 
gobie is quoted as saying that he and frank argued after the 
congressmans landlord learned gobie was operating a sexforhire 
business in franks capitol hill townhouse 
i told him i needed 2000 or 3000 to move to florida the 
authors quote gobie as telling them i thought washington had 
tapped out for me barney offered me 10000 to 12000 but i 
said i dont need that much 
the article does not say whether gobie said he received any 
money he has remained in washington 
frank said the report was totally bizarre as is virtually 
all of the new information in the article of the planned florida 
venture he said its the first time i ever heard of it 
the ethics committee is investigating an allegation that frank 
knew gobie was operating a prostitution business from his home 
frank has denied the allegation 
the congressman 49 has acknowledged paying 80 to gobie 33 
for an initial sexual encounter he says that after that they 
became friends and he gave gobie a job as a personal aide 
housekeeper and driver firing him after learning gobie was using 
his home as a business base 
franks financial report showed he raised 103476 in 1989 
including 45800 from pacs and about half of that coming after 
gobies allegations surfaced in august of 46 individual 
contributors only nine live in franks district

anguilla is not a real eel insists state sen 
richard matsuura who says it is simply the victim of bad publicity 
it looks like an eel but it is a true fish with scales 
gills fins et cetera he said 
matsuura is the current legislative champion of the nearly 
annual bill to allow the importation of anguilla rostrada and 
anguila japonica for research on raising them commercially as an 
aquaculture product 
there is a huge market for anguilla which sells for as much as 
16 a pound in europe and asia matsuura told the senate on monday 
the house agriculture committee last week killed the house 
version of the bill after siding with biologists and 
environmentalists who said there was too much risk that the 
slippery critters would escape into the wilds and munch away on 
hawaiis native stream life 
live anguilla were allowed into hawaii before 1974 primarily 
for the restaurant business matsuura said 
no one seems to know why the ban was placed on the anguilla 
except that it looked like an eel which it is not he said

new york should tax penthouse instead of 
plato and playboy instead of plutarch according to a state 
legislator 
state sen anthony masiello says its unfair that college 
students pay tax on textbooks but that magazines bring no extra 
state levy 
how can we collect sales tax on the works of the great masters 
while adult magazines and borderline pornography are trafficked 
openly and freely the democratic lawmaker asked monday 
under masiellos proposal the state would stop charging sales 
tax on college textbooks to compensate for the lost revenue 
masiello would charge sales tax on adult magazines which he 
defined as any magazine that must appear in a brown wrapper at a 
newsstand 
all magazines are exempt from new york state sales tax other 
states exempt textbooks from sales tax masiello said 
masiello said new york receives about 13 million a year from 
sales tax on textbooks he says taxing the magazines would bring in 
about 9 million

it counts for more than you think is a 
slogan about to begin bombarding americans as the 1990 census 
approaches 
a massive publicity campaign designed to encourage 
participation in the national head count was unveiled monday 
there will be both a national effort and specialized promotions for 
special groups 
this is our chance hispanicamericans will be told in 
spanishlanguage advertising while stand up for who you are is 
the theme targeted at blacks 
print advertising aimed at american indians carries the slogan 
listen to the drums raise your voice for asians advertising 
will feature an abacus and carry the theme any way we add it it 
makes good sense to answer the census 
five different advertising agencies have donated their work the 
50 state titleholders from the miss america pageant are serving as 
census ambassadors and businesses across the nation are helping 
out officials said monday in launching the publicity campaign for 
the 1990 census 
census day is april 1 thats the day the government wants to 
use as a snapshot of the american public 
participation is one of the most important activities each one 
of us can do as citizens said commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher 
more than 100 million census forms will be mailed out on march 
23 with a request that people fill out the answers and send them 
back following april 1 
since getting an accurate count depends on public cooperation 
the ad council a public service arm of the advertising industry 
was asked to help out the result was the series of promotion 
campaigns unveiled monday 
people who dont mail back the forms have to be contacted in 
person and every 1 percent increase in the mail response rate 
saves the government 10 million explained mosbacher 
reaching some americans is no easy task however and special 
efforts are being made 
brenda august los angeles census field coordinator said a 
former gang member has been hired to work with enumerators in her 
community seeking the cooperation of the gangs and easing their 
distrust of government officials 
census workers will wear special vests so they can be identified 
and receive safety training and travel in groups she explained 
but they will not be accompanied by police 
with red and blue colors used to differentiate the los angeles 
gangs ms august pointed out that both colors are being used on 
census products 
wellknown athletes are being used to help reach people in 
chicago said regional census director stan moore he said gangs 
also are being worked with and enumerators are being hired from 
among the residents of public housing projects 
miss america debbye turner and mosbacher filled out sample forms 
at mondays news conference handing them over to census director 
barbara e bryant 
turner called for americans to join together in answering the 
census and said the 50 state miss america titleholders will become 
encourage participation in their states 
census assistant director peter bounpane said many businesses 
are also assisting included are ads being shown on the goodyear 
blimp mailed ads being sent out by jc penney and sears roebuck 
and co and donated space for census workers to answer questions 
in many 7eleven stores 
the national campaign stressing the census counts for more 
than you think stresses the importance of census numbers in 
locating public facilities apportioning legislatures and 
distributing federal funds to localities 
that census answers are kept secret is also a major theme in the 
hispanic community where distrust of government officials often 
runs deep 
mrs bryant pointed out census records are kept private for 72 
years and information about individuals is not given to any other 
group either government of private 
faced with fbi agents carrying a subpoena for census files in 
1980 an agency official in denver barricaded the office and called 
washington the fbi agents were called off she said

a widely publicized proposal for cutting 
social security taxes apparently is not grabbing the attention of 
voters and has little support among senate taxwriters 
social security commissioner gwendolyn s king said the agencys 
tollfree number had received only about 60 calls on the tax cut 
since it was proposed in late december by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny 
i dont find a lot of support in my state for cutting payroll 
taxes senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said monday as 
the senate finance committee opened the first congressional hearing 
on the bill he said the subject has not come up at his public 
meetings in kansas and that his office has received only two 
letters on the subject 
members of the committee praised moynihan for turning the 
spotlight on the way surplus social security taxes are being used 
for general government needs from aircraft carriers to paper 
clips but no one offered a solid endorsement of the bill 
not a good idea sen john c danforth rmo said of the 
bill a tax cut would be disastrous for future retirees added 
sen john chafee rri 
sen john heinz rpa agreed with moynihan that social 
security surpluses should not mask the true size of the deficit but 
said the tax cut would almost certainly bankrupt social security 
in short order 
democrats treated the proposal more gently this may be the 
best answer we can find to stop the use of social security taxes 
to cut the budget deficit said sen don riegle dmich who added 
he has not made a decision 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the committee said use 
of social security surpluses for deficit reduction can no longer be 
ignored but did not recommend how the problem can be corrected 
robert j myers who helped create the system in 1934 and was 
its chief actuary for 23 years endorsed the reduction 
the time has arrived when the financing of the old age 
survivors and disability insurance program should be rationalized 
stabilized and made crystal clear by going to a payasyougo 
basis as proposed by senator moynihan myers told the committee 
moynihan wants to eliminate the surpluses by rolling back the 
rate tax increase that took effect jan 1 and by cutting the rate 
again next year to 655 percent the rate now is 765 percent of 
the first 51300 earned employers match contributions from the 
132 million employees 
congress and the reagan administration planned for the social 
security surpluses to grow by 1 billion a week when they 
overhauled the system in 1983 to ensure benefits will be financed 
when the large generation born soon after world war ii begins 
retiring in about 2012 
under the law the surpluses must be invested in government 
securities which will have to be redeemed in the future to finance 
benefits but the surplus taxes are actually being used to finance 
general government spending and to hide the true size of the budget 
deficit 
robert m ball social security commissioner from 1962 to 1973 
said if congress eliminates the surpluses the money should be 
transferred into the medicare hospitalization fund not used for 
tax cuts 
the bush administration vigorously opposes the cut as a threat 
to benefits and an opening for increases in other taxes 
nevertheless social security commissioner king told the hearing 
the administration is open to every reasonable alternative so 
long as any change does not upset the sound financial footing 
of the last seven years 
bush said last month that moynihans bill is a disguise for 
increased taxes around the corner 
the president wants to do nothing about the surpluses until the 
federal budget is balanced 1993 at the earliest and then to use 
surplus social security taxes only for debt reduction

the energy department says virtually all its 
nuclear weapons plants appear to be violating safety health and 
environmental rules and the department itself is to blame for 
failing to correct the problems 
a report released by the department monday said some of the 
health and safety violations posed relatively high risks of 
injury or death to small numbers of workers at the plants among 
the problems cited was improper use of toxic substances and 
electrical dangers 
the report compiled previously disclosed problems at six weapons 
plants the rocky flats plutonium processing plant in colorado the 
fernald uranium processing plant and the mound weapons laboratory 
in ohio the y12 uranium plant in tennessee the pantex weapons 
assembly plant in texas and the west valley radioactive waste site 
in new york 
the report was prepared by the department to analyze the 
findings of special investigations of the six plants by private 
contractors and consultants the rest of the weapons plants are to 
be investigated during 1990 
energy secretary james d watkins expressed dismay at the 
conclusions including a finding that five of six weapons plants 
evaluated last fall were storing wastes in violation of federal 
environmental laws and three were inadequately controlling 
radiation 
the report said other common problems include poor emergency 
planning a failure by plant managers to take environmental 
regulations seriously and a shortage of skilled workers 
the report blamed the problems partly on the energy departments 
failure to impose tougher management practices at the plants which 
are owned by the government but run by private contractors 
we must demonstrate that we are able to discipline ourselves 
and our contractors watkins wrote in an internal memorandum 
released with the report our inability to conform to our own 
requirements is particularly disturbing 
one of the plants cited as illegally storing wastes was rocky 
flats which is under fbi investigation for possible criminal 
violations of environmental laws watkins has acknowledged before 
that rocky flats and other atomic bomb plants are not complying 
with waste laws and has pledged to correct the problems as quickly 
as possible 
in his memorandum to department employees watkins said that 
although he saw indications of improvements at the plants he was 
not satisfied that all managers take the need for further 
improvements seriously 
steps to eliminate the business as usual approach to 
compliance are still required he wrote

federal safety officials say they are 
surprised and disturbed by new evidence of fatigue and drug 
abuse as major causes of fatal truck accidents 
the evidence came in a report adopted monday by the national 
transportation safety board which found onethird of truck drivers 
killed in the crashes studied tested positive for alcohol 
marijuana cocaine overthecounter stimulants or other drugs 
the study covered 182 fatal truck accidents in eight states 
about onefourth of the national total between october 1987 and 
september 1988 
we are surprised and disturbed by the findings said board 
chairman james kolstad after the fourmember board unanimously 
adopted the report 
the study said impairment of the driver because of fatigue was a 
cause in 315 percent of the crashes with just slightly fewer 
attributed to alcohol or drug abuse 
the safety board drew up several recommendations but postponed a 
vote on their adoption kolstad said they include increased testing 
for alcohol and other drugs with a proposed demonstration project 
to screen all drivers who pass a given weigh station rather than 
current random testing 
the board also will recommend tamperproof onboard recording 
devices to identify drivers who exceed the maximum of 10 hours of 
driving with eight hours rest 
the board has no rulemaking power but makes recommendations to 
federal and state agencies 
other proposals include state laws that would discourage any use 
of alcohol or other drugs that might impair driving including a 
reduction of the tolerable blood alcohol concentration for 
commercial drivers to 001 percent the current level is 004 with 
the legal limit for the general public at 01 
the cab of a truck should be a drugfree zone said kolstad 
citing evidence than any amount of alcohol can impair driving 
drivers who are at the wheel for long hours often use drugs in 
an effort to stay awake said kevin quinlan board staff member who 
led the study he said investigators traced the activities of each 
driver in the study to determine how many hours were driven and 
when possible how much rest the driver had prior to the accident 
its clear fatigue was a constant companion of the drivers in 
this study quinlan said 
board member jim burnett said there also are indications of 
inadequate medical screening of drivers with 19 of the accidents 
blamed on heart attacks or other driver medical problems 
this study indicates to us weve got a lot of holes in the 
medical qualification process holes that you could run a truck 
through said burnett during board discussion of the report 
burnett said although drug use decreases as drivers get older 
they are more susceptible to health risks 
the report showed marijuana and alcohol were the most common 
substances found in tests of drivers who were killed with 13 
percent of the fatalities showing evidence of one or the other 
cocaine was found in 9 percent of the fatalities overthecounter 
stimulants in 8 percent amphetamines in 7 percent and opiates or 
pcp in less than 1 percent 
more than 80 percent of the drivers who tested positive for 
drugs had a record of prior abuse and abusers were more likely to 
have a suspended or revoked license and to have violated federal 
regulations against long driving times the report said 
the study covered all fatal accidents involving trucks of over 
10000 pounds gross weight ranging from straight trucks to 
tractors with two trailers it included cases in california 
colorado georgia missouri maryland new jersey north carolina 
tennessee and wisconsin

savings and loan bailout officials are trying 
to strike a balance between preventing fraud and efficiently 
selling the mountain of sour loans and repossessed real estate 
inherited from failed thrift institutions 
the resolution trust corp created last august to conduct 
president bushs sampl cleanup adopted ethics rules monday governing 
its employees and the thousands of private consultants and managers 
it expects to hire 
the rules for contractors were also approved by an 
administration oversight board headed by treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady 
they are designed to screen out contractors with conflicts of 
interest a past record of fraud a pattern of defaults or previous 
involvement with a savings and loan collapse they apply to anyone 
receiving contracts worth 25000 a year or more 
the rtc is expected to take over about 600 failed sampls with 
assets of more than 300 billion its contracts will be a huge 
opportunity for lawyers accountants investment bankers real 
estate brokers appraisers property managers and other 
professionals 
but the cleanup also will present massive opportunity for 
fraud in a report last week the general accounting office 
congress watchdog agency put the disposal of thrift assets at the 
head of a list of 14 areas in government most vulnerable to abuse 
a sale of this magnitude is unparalleled in history and 
highly susceptible to fraud waste and abuse it said 
rep bruce vento dminn chairman of a house task force 
overseeing the rtc said tough rules are necessary even though in 
some communities there is no one left to do the business except 
those that have been involved in the losses 
the american public has a very low tolerance for this entire 
sampl issue vento said to maintain any kind of public support 
you will have to demonstrate there is an effort to try to limit 
those involved in creating the problem from profiting from it 
however paul horvitz a business professor at the university of 
houston said regulators may be overreacting and causing delays 
that will cost taxpayers money 
the rtc doesnt want to deal with crooks or people whove 
caused problems in the past but in an attempt to be squeaky 
clean they may just run into time delays he said 
in perhaps its most controversial provision the contractor 
rules screen out anyone who caused a loss of 50000 or more to 
government deposit insurance funds 
some contractors complain that such a low limit bars practically 
anyone who did business in texas during the oil bust when 
thousands of people defaulted on home mortgages and business loans 
from banks and sampls that failed 
stephen katsanos a spokesman for the agency said there is a 
strong likelihood many firms in texas and other oil patch 
states will be disqualified creating a business opportunity for 
outofstate firms 
katherine corigliano the rtcs ethics officer said the agency 
will apply a rule of reason to interpreting the regulations 
any contractor excluded from doing business under the rules can 
offer an explanation and ask for an exception 
that however places a burden on the agencys staff to make 
thousands of casebycase reviews officials plan at first to 
conduct most of the reviews in washington but after precedents are 
established farm most of the work out to the rtcs regional 
offices which should be able to make decisions faster 
it strikes me that its going to be a terribly 
peopleintensive process said rtc board member robert clarke

for the first time foreign visitors are 
spending more in the united states than americans are spending 
overseas the commerce department reports 
the united states gained a 450 million travel surplus last 
year commerce undersecretary rockwell schnabel said monday 
and don wynegar research director for the departments us 
travel and tourism administration said the surplus is projected to 
reach 15 billion this year 
foreign visitors spent 343 billion in the united states in 
1989 while americans spent 339 billion abroad american and 
foreign travelers spent an identical 87 billion getting to their 
destinations 
the ustta said the nations record travel deficit was posted in 
1985 when it climbed to 94 billion it attributed the turnaround 
to foreign travel to the united states growing twice as fast as 
americans overseas travel 
the ustta is forecasting a 6 percent increase to 407 million 
foreign visitors this year and a 7 percent gain to 434 million in 
1991 by the year 2000 schnabel said there are expected to be 67 
million foreign tourists spending a projecting 89 billion in the 
united states 
neighboring canada and mexico as might be expected had the 
largest share of visitors to the united states in 1989 a combined 
64 percent 152 million from canada and 93 million from mexico 
wynegar said 
they were followed by 3 million japanese tourists and 22 
million british visitors 
schnabel said the greatest growth in 1990 is expected from 
mexico with an 11 percent increase to 104 million visitors 
overseas arrivals he said are projected to grow by about 8 
percent and canadian arrivals by 2 percent 
overseas markets with the largest potential for continued growth 
include japan britain australia and sweden 
while arrivals from japan and the united kingdom seem to be 
slowing slightly averaging 9 percent growth per year growth from 
australia and sweden is expected to average 14 percent annually in 
1990 and 1991 he said 
schnabel described the tourism industry as many different 
parts making up the largest service industry in the world 
in fact we are a 2 trillion industry worldwide employing 
over 100 million people or one out of every 16 people in the 
worlds workforce he continued 
in the united states schnabel said the travel industry is the 
second largest employer after health services employing nearly 6 
million people 
and he said domestic and foreign travelers together spent 
350 billion in the united states last year making travel and 
tourism the third largest retail business in the country after 
automobile and health services

although the soviet communist party appears poised 
to give up its constitutionally guaranteed grip on power it is 
unlikely to soon follow fraternal parties in eastern europe and 
actually surrender the reins of power 
president mikhail s gorbachev proposed to the party central 
committee on monday that the communists take the historic step of 
surrendering the guarantee they have in the constitution of being 
the countrys leading and guiding force 
communists he said must earn the right to run the country 
in taking that step gorbachev acknowledged the power of the 
prodemocracy movement he unleashed when he began his reform 
program upon rising to power five years ago 
but he also understands that conditions are far different in his 
country than they are in other eastern european nations where 
communist power crumbled in some cases within a matter of weeks 
gorbachev repeatedly has said that no other political forces 
exist in the soviet union that are capable of the wideranging 
activities in which the party engages for years the party 
ruthlessly repressed any effort to oppose it 
in addition the soviet communist party has been in power much 
longer than its fraternal former ruling parties in eastern europe 
which were forced on former satellites by josef stalin and thus 
resented for nationalist reasons by the people of those countries 
through the years of stalins absolute rule the soviet ruling 
party had no written guarantee of political power and it was only 
in the last constitution adopted in 1977 that its monopoly was 
assured 
encouraged by gorbachevs reforms opposition to authoritarian 
communist rule has grown in recent months but the forces of 
dissent still are widely scattered across this vast country of more 
than 100 nationalities 
the most widespread phenomenon is the birth of peoples front 
political movements that have sprung up to press local demands for 
more autonomy 
the movements are strongest in the baltic republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia they began there less than two years 
ago and are now leading to the formation of some small political 
parties that will contest local elections this spring 
despite growing contacts between the peoples front movements of 
various republics and regions local issues still are paramount to 
the groups and no cohesive national organization or program has 
been established 
in the baltics the peoples front organizations increasingly 
are setting their sights on complete independence from the 
russianruled soviet union 
another organization the democratic platform has united 
disgruntled communists who are close to declaring the party 
incapable of reform and forming a social democratic party 
democratic platform joined with other groups to organize a huge 
rally in moscow on sunday the eve of the central committee 
meeting and demanded that the party give up its claim to exclusive 
power 
its founding conference in moscow in midjanuary drew 
representatives from many soviet cities but the organization lacks 
money and access to official media advantages enjoyed by the 
communist party 
many communist leaders are likely to take a drubbing in the 
local elections this spring repeating the embarrassing experience 
of balloting last march that were the countrys first contested 
national elections in seven decades 
however because of what opposition members called the unfair 
rules of the game about 80 percent of those elected to the 
congress of peoples deputies were party members 
communist officials are faced not so much with the prospect of 
losing power to an organized opposition as they are with losing 
their cohesiveness and the trust of the people 
they are blamed for the dismal state of the economy which has 
wrought widespread consumer shortages and resented for enjoying a 
higher standard of living than most soviets by virtue of their 
power 
under gorbachevs reform program local and regional communist 
officials are going to have to give up the perks and privilege if 
they wish to earn the public trust 
but as gorbachev envisions it centralized decisionmaking 
would be scrapped and local officials would be permitted the leeway 
to solve problems efficiently 
that the soviet president feels would boost the prestige of a 
party which otherwise would continue its steep decline

a ruling that former president reagan must 
testify at an irancontra trial could lead to a major 
constitutional battle over the right of presidents to refuse to 
testify or reveal confidential documents in court 
us district court judge harold greene on monday ordered reagan 
to provide videotaped testimony at the trial of former national 
security adviser john poindexter 
but the judge gave reagan and president bush until friday to 
invoke executive privilege to avoid testimony by the former 
president 
greene also renewed his order that reagan immediately turn over 
33 diary entries to poindexter reagan promptly invoked executive 
privilege to avoid turning portions of his diaries over to 
poindexter 
however there was no immediate decision on whether reagan would 
agree to provide a videotaped deposition before the start of 
poindexters trial 
it would be inconceivable to exempt mr reagan from the 
duty of every citizen to give evidence that will permit the 
reaching of a just outcome of this criminal prosecution greene 
said monday 
legal scholars said the judges order could lead to a new 
supreme court test of executive privilege the doctrine invoked to 
shield presidents from court appearances or divulging confidential 
information 
it remains to be seen what reagan will do said georgetown 
university law professor samuel dash who was chief counsel to the 
senate watergate committee in the mid1970s 
when reagan was president dash noted he told the american 
people he believed he should be open completely in the irancontra 
case i dont know whether he has changed his mind 
if reagan refuses to testify on the basis of executive 
privilege greene could postpone the poindexter trial now 
scheduled to begin feb 20 while the matter is appealed directly 
to the supreme court 
given the importance of the issue the high court could expedite 
consideration of the case and hear arguments in the spring 
the courts last word on executive privilege was provided in 
1974 when it ordered president richard m nixon to provide white 
house tape recordings to a prosecutor in the watergate bugging case 
the justices in 1974 unanimously said the general assertion 
of privilege must yield to the demonstrated specific need for 
evidence in a pending criminal trial 
but new york university law professor bernard schwartz said the 
rulings impact is not clearcut 
what would have happened if nixon raised a claim of national 
security schwartz asked suggesting the outcome might have been 
different 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy obstructing congress and 
making false statements 
invoking executive privilege regarding the diary entries will 
allow reagan to gain access to a secret filing in which poindexter 
told why he needs the diaries 
if reagan determines the excerpts contain admissible evidence 
not available from other sources the former president may decide 
to waive his claim of privilege said reagan attorney theodore 
olson 
greene said he will allow poindexter to question reagan on a 
wide range of subjects in the irancontra affair including whether 
reagan approved poindexters denials to congress that former white 
house national security aide oliver l north was raising money and 
providing military advice to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
poindexter also will be allowed to ask reagan about the 
presidents knowledge regarding the relationship of oliver north 
with specific individuals involved in irancontra activities 
the president told the investigative tower board on jan 26 
1987 that he did not know the national security council staff was 
helping the contras 
poindexter has said reagan took notes at meetings focusing on 
congressional inquiries into norths activities to help the contras 
north tried to subpoena bush and reagan to testify at his own 
trial but us district judge gerhard gesell last year refused to 
order either man to testify saying north failed to show their 
testimony would be relevant to his defense 
north is appealing his convictions of obstructing congress 
destroying government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity 
no sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminal 
trial although some have provided testimony or the rough 
equivalent 
in 1975 thenpresident gerald r ford gave a videotaped 
deposition in the trial of lynette squeaky fromme convicted of 
trying to assassinate ford the videotape was played for jurors at 
frommes trial 
president jimmy carter provided videotaped testimony twice while 
in office once in the prosecution of a georgia state senator and 
once in a grand jury investigation of financier robert vesco

airline passengers should be told if their 
flight is the target of a terrorist bomb threat only if they notice 
and ask about increased security precautions the head of the 
federal aviation administration says 
but faa administrator james busey also maintains that because 
most bomb threats are hoaxes up to 600 a year proving false no 
public warning should be made in the vast majority of cases 
busey noted the faa continues to insist airlines not disclose 
the contents of the agencys security notices and bulletins 
containing intelligence information on terrorist threats 
i think passengers should operate on the assumption that if 
the plane is going there is no threat busey told reporters 
monday if we cannot guarantee the security and the safety of 
that flight the bird does not fly 
but busey said a distinction can be made when a passenger 
arrives at an airport departure lounge and observes bombsniffing 
dogs the searching of carryon luggage and other signs of 
heightened security 
the experienced traveler will know that something is going 
on he said and they have every right to know what it is 
air travelers who ask should be told the reason for the 
precautions to have the flexibility to make his own personal 
decision independently busey said 
but overall he said our policy remains that we not go 
public 
the issue of whether passengers should be told of terrorist 
threats arose after reports that some us diplomats were told of a 
1988 bomb threat against pan am flight 103 
the aircraft exploded over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 
killing 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
in separate incidents last year northwest and delta airlines 
broke from standard industry practice when they issued public 
announcements that some of their flights had been threatened 
busey called in representatives of all major us airlines for a 
listening session over the issue apparently concluding there 
are rare occasions when it is prudent to tell passengers their 
flight has been threatened 
on monday busey spelled out for the first time an example of 
such a rare occasion 
spokesmen for aviation watchdog groups and representatives of 
the family associations formed after the destruction of pan am 103 
have harshly criticized the faa and the airline industry for 
failing to give passengers adequate warning of threats 
a presidential commission formed to make security 
recommendations in the aftermath of the pan am flight is 
addressing the issue of whether passengers should be informed of 
threats the commissions report is due in midmay

the battle to restore the death penalty in 
new york again may rest on a conservative republican senator whose 
bout with cancer has given him second thoughts about bringing back 
the electric chair 
sen james donovan missed mondays vote in the state senate on 
legislation to restore capital punishment a measure democratic 
gov mario cuomo has promised to veto for the eighth straight year 
a consistent death penalty supporter donovan was unable to vote 
because he was suffering the side effects of chemotherapy said 
edward byrne an aide to the 25year senate veteran the 
legislation was approved 4020 
the measure now goes to the 150member assembly where a vote 
isnt expected until late february at the earliest 
without donovans vote or a switch by one of the no votes 
death penalty advocates lack the 41 senate votes needed to override 
a veto 
thirtyseven states have death penalty laws new york is the 
largest state without one 
the states last execution was in 1963 
last year donovan said his battle with cancer had caused him to 
have second thoughts about the death penalty that was enough to 
prompt the senates republican leadership to scrap any attempt at 
an override in 1989 
on friday byrne had confidently predicted donovan would be on 
hand for mondays vote saying he hasnt missed a day yet this 
year 
on monday byrne said he was not sure how the senator would 
vote but he insisted donovan was not ducking the vote 
the senates chief sponsor of the legislation republican dale 
volker said he was confident donovan would eventually vote for 
capital punishment 
ive said from the beginning that jim donovan has always voted 
for the death penalty and i think he will again said volker 
adding that he might even pick up some more votes when it came time 
for the override attempt 
the senate action began whats become an annual event at the 
capitol every year both houses pass the death penalty bill cuomo 
vetoes it and legislators then count noses to see if theyve got 
the votes for an override thus far they have come up short 
this years battle has taken on additional meaning because the 
governors job and all 211 seats in the legislature go before the 
voters in november 
republicans as in the past are expected to make cuomos 
opposition to the death penalty a major campaign issue 
the legislation would permit the death penalty for the most 
heinous murders such as contract killings and the slaying of 
witnesses cuomo arguing the death penalty is debasing and not a 
deterrent has called instead for lifewithoutparole sentences for 
some murderers the gopcontrolled senate has refused to go along 
with that argument 
new york states electric chair hasnt been used since aug 15 
1963 when eddie lee mays convicted of murder in a harlem bar 
shooting became the 695th person put to death in new york

the food and drug administration says tests 
for antibiotics in milk samples from 14 metropolitan areas show the 
nations milk supply is safe 
the fda said its findings contradict the results of screenings 
by the wall street journal and the center for science in the public 
interest which recently found residues of potentially harmful 
drugs used to treat sick cattle 
our study indicates that the american dairy farmer is using 
animal drugs carefully and conscientiously and that the milk 
supply does not contain unsafe drug residues gerald guest 
director of fdas center for veterinary medicine said in a 
statement monday 
the journals tests conducted by rutgers university scientists 
on 50 retail samples collected in 10 major cities found 38 percent 
were contaminated with antibiotics and sulfa drugs used to treat 
sick cattle this class of drugs includes sulfamethazine a 
suspected carcinogen 
the survey by the center for science in the public interest 
conducted in conjunction with the journal tested 20 milk samples 
from store shelves in metropolitan washington and found 20 percent 
were tainted 
the fda noted at the time the tests used in the screenings 
known as charm ii can detect only classes of drugs not specific 
drugs within a class it also said the levels of residues found in 
the journals testing did not pose a public health threat 
the fda also used the charm ii method in its tests and got 
positive readings for 51 percent of its 70 samples 
however the fda said it also used new testing methods that are 
more sensitive and specific than charm ii none of the charm ii 
positives was confirmed by the new methods the fda said also 
testing for specific drugs found no contamination with 
sulfamethazine which is not approved for use in any foodproducing 
animal 
the fda samples were taken from atlanta baltimore boston 
chicago dallas denver kansas city los angeles miami 
minneapolisst paul philadelphia new york san francisco and 
seattle 
michael jacobson executive director of the center for science 
in the public interest said the charm ii test is well documented 
and reliable 
its puzzling that the fda would not be able to confirm any 
samples that charm ii found contaminants in he said i think 
the reason for the discrepancy has to be determined before one can 
say anything definite 
the fda said it plans to regularly monitor pasteurized milk for 
the presence of drug residues to supplement testing by the states 
the agency also said it will work toward adoption by the states 
of new testing procedures states currently rely on a method 
originally designed to detect penicillin and which also detects 
other antibiotics but not with the same sensitivity

a monument commemorating the 25th 
anniversary of the free speech movement at the university of 
california at berkeley has revived the bitterness over its legacy 
veterans of the protest which helped launch a decade of 
dissent by the nations youth endorse the idea of a monument to 
their accomplishment but the universitys chancellor and some 
faculty deride the proposal as a gesture of remarkable 
arrogance 
we want something that is meant as a tribute and inspiration 
to all freedom fighters said charles schwartz a physics 
professor who last year dreamed up the idea of commissioning 
artwork for the project 
since then the proposal has garnered support from 100 
professors local politicians students and most of the now 
middleage leaders of the free speech movement 
but chancellor ira michael heyman who must accept the monument 
before it can be placed on campus said he was troubled by the 
proposal 
it is not clear why the free speech movement of 1964 deserves 
such special commemoration he wrote in a public letter to 
schwartz and peter selz a retired art history professor and the 
former chief curator of the new york museum of modern art 
he added that those involved in the movement were not very 
good at designing public art to commemorate their own actions 
in a subsequent statement heyman criticized public art on the 
campus saying statues do not wear well and they are vulnerable 
to being defaced 
more than 270 people including internationally known artists 
have submitted proposals for the artwork and a sevenmember 
committee was scheduled to name five finalists today 
their work will be displayed and a final selection announced 
march 3 organizers who have already raised 30000 plan to give 
the winner 70000 to build the monument which will be donated to 
the university 
the movement began in the fall of 1964 when philosophy student 
mario savio and friend jack weinberg set up a card table to 
distribute political material on the universitys sproul plaza 
the school had enacted a ban on campus political activities 
because it feared civil disobedience actions were disrupting 
classes 
weinberg was arrested and placed in the back of a patrol car 
but hundreds of students surrounded the automobile and for 32 hours 
refused to let 600 police officers take him into custody 
photographs of savio and others addressing the crowd from atop 
the police car were published around the world leading to sympathy 
strikes by students until the university dropped its ban several 
months later 
the often iconoclastic proposals to commemorate the 
confrontation include a huge screw two chairs facing each other on 
two pedestals a giant megaphone three monkeys in a cage a 
suspended exclamation mark and a bronze fist breaking through the 
pavement with the middle finger extended 
supporters of the monument are casting the dispute as another 
free speech issue accusing the university of trying to stifle a 
permanent reminder of its attempt to keep students and others from 
engaging in political activities on campus 25 years agao 
the free speech movement had effects all over the world and 
continues to inspire students everywhere selz said 
mayor loni hancock who participated in the protests and 
endorses the monument proposal said the event brought together 
students of all political persuasion from leftists to young 
republicans 
were a country that too often forgets our past said the 
mayor the free speech movement was a milestone of the 1960s the 
recognition by young people of all types that they would be 
participants in the governing forces around them 
with whats happening today in eastern europe how can we not 
pause to honor that 
but others say the movement did not live up to the principles it 
espoused 
david littlejohn a journalism professor said the movement 
heralded an era of dogmatic liberalism in which conservatives are 
routinely shouted down during public speeches on campus 
in a letter to a local newspaper he called the monument 
proposal a gesture of remarkable arrogance and unjustified 
selfassurance to welcome it to this campus would be to reject 
and insult the opinions of any members of the campus who did not 
regard the movement as berkeleys finest hour

the dollar closed unchanged from its opening tuesday at 14490 
yen down 070 yen from mondays 14560yen finish it ranged 
between 1448014503 yen during trading 
traders attributed the dollars overnight decline mainly to the 
strength of the west german mark confidence in the prospects for

mean less demand for dollars to buy the bonds 
but brokers in tokyo said they expected japanese investors to

line with japanese demand at previous auctions

the state attorney generals 
squeakyclean image is taking a beating because of disclosures that 
the gubernatorial hopeful charged the state for meals with people 
who say they didnt dine with him 
a judge a congressman and others listed in steve clarks 
records of how he used his stateissued visa card have said the 
records are in error some others who agree they were with him say 
the meals were dates not state business 
clark 42 has found his bid for governor suddenly sullied with 
some reports suggesting he ought to get out of the race perhaps 
resign 
i am redoubling my efforts to win this race he said last 
week but then he scrubbed two political events during the weekend 
and went into seclusion to consult advisers 
state police and legislative auditors began combing his expense 
vouchers monday at the request of the prosecutor in little rock 
who helped write the states yearold ethics law 
clark a democrat in his 12th year as attorney general said he 
is guilty of nothing more than memory lapses and keeping poor 
records he has repaid the state almost 4000 
although clark has acknowledged nearly 4000 in mistakes 
reports by two little rock newspapers the arkansas gazette and 
the arkansas democrat say the errors exceed 4000 and may amount 
to more than 6000 
in a state where the average monthly bluecollar salary is 
1525 clark has had to explain why he needed 562 to entertain 
four political supporters at an august dinner one of many 
instances of clark billing the state for meals at posh little rock 
restaurants 
he also has had to explain why many of the people listed as his 
guests in records dating from 1986 say they were not with him at 
the time 
among the phantom guests are us district judge richard s 
arnold of the 8th circuit court of appeals rep tommy robinson 
rark and state supreme court justice steele hays 
you must have the wrong richard arnold arnold replied when 
asked about the 24376 meal clark said he had shared with the 
judge and another man i have never actually eaten dinner with 
steve clark 
rex nelson a spokesman for robinson himself a gubernatorial 
hopeful for the republican party said the congressman has never 
been to lascalas before with clark or anyone else i had to tell 
him where it was clark reported spending 29 on his meal with 
robinson at the little rock restaurant 
clark who is divorced was on dates at two of his stateissued

the disclosures about clarks records have set off a wave of 
jokes about the attorney on bumper stickers

there is no doubt about it clark said of his records it 
was an honest mistake but i made a mistake im sorry and i 
apologize 
clark said he would sit down every 60 to 90 days with his visa 
bill and divide the personal and business expenses using sketchy

may have seen arnold at the restaurant jotted that down and 90

texas gov bill clements says its premature 
to be talking about getting foreign investors to build the huge 
super collider in his state 
clements said monday after meeting with energy secretary james 
watkins the energy department is not prepared to request foreign 
help until congress has completely endorsed the collider and 
foreign countries have been assured of its total costs and design 
rep tom bevill dala chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the collider was adamant last 
year that the department come up with a plan to share the cost of 
the collider with foreign countries 
were not in a position to ask for foreign help certainly 
no one overseas is in a position to make a commitment for x 
dollars until they know what y cost is and until congress has 
completely endorsed the program said clements and so foreign 
participation which everybody likes to talk about is premature to 
talk about at this point clements said 
only india has said it is willing to contribute to the collider 
up to 50 million president bush is seeking a 318 million 
appropriation for the collider in next years budget last year he 
asked for 250 million and congress voted 225 million 
the collider when completed late in the decade will allow 
scientists to test theories about the fundamental nature of matter 
by smashing together beams of protons at 20 times the energy now 
possible 
the original cost estimate at 59 billion will rise by 1 
billion to 2 billion if the original design is maintained a 
course watkins has indicated he favors

logs cut on federal land were sold to a 
japanese company by one of two men accused of conspiracy to 
illegally export the unprocessed timber a forest service 
investigator testified 
michael nitsch said monday he traced several dozen logs at an 
aberdeen wash shipping terminal to joh j tortorelli tortorelli 
had sold the raw logs to nichimen american inc a japanese 
exporting firm nitsch said 
his testimony came in the first day of the trial of tortorelli 
and winston d bentley the two are charged with orchestrating a 
scheme for exporting unprocessed logs cut on national forests in 
violation of a federal law designed to protect american jobs 
defense attorney michael moses said the logs purchased by 
tortorelli with bentleys help were all thought to have been cut on 
private land where the export ban does not apply 
if convicted the defendants each could be sentenced to 10 years 
in prison and fined 20000 
the concern over exports has been heightened by timber shortages 
blamed for layoffs and sawmill closures 
there are only so many logs for our mills us attorney 
pete dunbar has said if they are exporting logs illegally 
doesnt that take away from the capability of montana mills 
a grand jury indictment last fall said tortorelli arranged to 
buy timber from logging companies and resell the unprocessed logs 
on the lucrative export market 
bentley allegedly helped tortorelli by managing a logsorting 
yard in mead wash and acted as tortorellis agent by 
advertising soliciting and inspecting logs 
the indictment said both men falsely told sellers the logs would 
be processed in this country 
also charged were truck drivers duane farmer and roger britz 
who worked for northern transport inc of enumclaw wash they were 
hired by tortorelli to haul logs from forests in washington idaho 
and montana to ports in washington the indictment said 
farmer and britz have been given immunity in exchange for their 
testimony against tortorelli and bentley 
forest service officials have said 558515 boardfeet of timber 
were involved with about twothirds from forests in northwest 
montana 
northwest timber exports in 1988 were at least 43 billion 
boardfeet up 20 percent from 1987 
nitsch said he received a tip in february 1988 that logs bearing 
forest service marks were being trucked to the aberdeen port he 
said he found about 70 such logs there each bearing a tag 
indicating they had been sold to nichimen 
nitsch said he tracked about 60 of the logs to forests in 
washington and montana and determined they had been sold by 
tortorelli to the japanese company 
david faulkner a timber sales specialist for the forest service 
in coeur dalene idaho testified an unprocessed log sold to 
another country can bring five times as much as one sold to a us 
mill 
in his opening argument moses said the national forest logs 
bought by tortorelli were sold and processed in this country his 
clients were not aware of any logs with forest service markings 
being exported he said 
the trial before us district judge charles lovell is expected 
to last at least a week

former mayors dianne feinstein of san francisco and andrew young 
of atlanta launched bids for governor of their states and frank l 
rizzo said he would try a third time to become a threeterm mayor 
of philadelphia 
also monday sen jim exon dneb said he was seeking a third 
term and fourterm indianapolis mayor william h hudnut said he was 
accepting the pleas of republican leaders to run for secretary of 
state 
feinstein and young will seek the governorships on the 
democratic tickets in races that would be a first in their states 
for women and blacks if they are elected 
the two probusiness politicians said they oppose raising taxes 
and both will campaign as prochoice candidates but from there 
their styles differ 
feinstein 56 called her bid a historic step for women she is 
an underdog in polls and fundraising to democratic state attorney 
general john van de kamp and republican us sen pete wilson in 
californias june 5 primary the incumbent republican george 
deukmejian is not seeking reelection this fall 
young 57 has avoided appeals based on race and continued that 
strategy in his first official campaign speech he spoke of a 
coalition campaign with young and old rural and suburban folks 
the former ambassador to the united nations who stepped down as 
atlantas mayor last month after eight years in office leads a pack 
of five democrats in a poll conducted by the atlanta 
journalconstitution last fall 
georgias primary is july 17 and if no candidate receives 50 
percent of the vote there will be a runoff aug 7 for the november 
election 
young sounded campaign themes of progress and education and 
strove to reassure people outside atlanta about his ideas and his 
qualifications he was a key player in the civilrights movement 
and represented atlanta in congress from 197377 
i want you to get to know me he said before embarking on a 
fourday road tour of 17 georgia cities i think youll be 
pleasantly surprised 
feinstein launched her candidacy in san francisco los angeles 
and sacramento 
at a rally in san francisco feinstein drew the loudest applause 
when she talked of abortion and the fact she is the first woman to 
mount a major campaign for governor in california 
this is a big moment for me and an historic one for women 
she said much thought and deliberation preceded this decision i 
am a nonincumbent in a race against two entrenched statewide 
figures a woman in a field of men 
and on the abortion issue feinstein said 
its true men can protect womens rights but its also true 
the experiences of men and women are different experiences i very 
strongly believe with a woman who is governor i know if she 
believes in choice shes not going to have anything to do with any 
erosion of that basic optional right 
young also addressed abortion and said he would push for a state 
lottery prmosing leadership that will protect a womans right to 
choose and protect your right to vote for a lottery if you so 
choose 
rizzo who served as philadelphias mayor from 1972 to 1980 as a 
democrat lost his latest effort to regain city hall on the 
republican ballot in 1987 when mayor w wilson goode was reelected 
by 18000 votes 
but rizzo a former beat cop and police commissioner said 
this time they cant beat me after wilson goode in this town i 
even get the liberals now 
when rizzo squared off against goode for the second time in 
1987 voter turnout was more than 70 percent politicians viewed 
the high turnout especially in predominantly black wards as 
voting against rizzo rather than for goode whose popularity 
suffered after the citys violent confrontation with the radical 
group move in 1985 
the election is in 1991 
in indiana hudnut 57 will likely face democratic incumbent 
joseph h hogsett hogsett 33 was appointed after evan bayh left

the states first female attorney general 
went on the offensive and sued the federal government over its 
order that virginia military institute accept women 
state attorney general mary sue terry filed the lawsuit in us 
district court in roanoke on monday less than an hour after the 
institute voted to uphold its menonly admission policy 
the lawsuit asks the court to declare the policy constitutional 
at the 150yearold taxsupported school in lexington 
terry named us attorney general dick thornburgh and the 
justice department as defendants in the lawsuit which came a week 
after the department threatened to sue the state over the 
admissions policy 
this action is filed in order to prevent federal encroachment 
seeking to enforce unnecessary conformity in the statesupported 
system of higher education in virginia the lawsuit said 
the justice departments finding was made without any inquiry 
into the state interest served by vmi and without any visit to vmi 
to review firsthand its program of instruction the lawsuit 
said women are not denied equal educational opportunity by vmis 
admissions policy 
terry said women who want a militaryschool education can enroll 
in the rotc program at virginia tech another statesupported 
university 
the statesupported system of higher education in virginia is 
richly diverse consisting of both public and private 
institutions the lawsuit said 
after a nearly twohour closed meeting vmis board unanimously 
approved a resolution affirming the menonly admissions policy at 
the 1250student school 
we do not believe that vmis admissions policy violates any 
provision of law including the constitutions of virginia and the 
united states the resolution said we believe that vmis 
academic mission contributes to the diversity and balance of the 
virginia system of higher education 
the justice department said vmis admissions policy violates the 
14th amendment to the constitution and the civil rights act of 
1964 it set a feb 20 deadline for the state to respond with a 
plan for ending the singlesex policy or face a lawsuit 
the department will stand by its original plan to sue if the 
state does not change its mind said deborah burstionwade a 
justice spokeswoman 
were sticking by our case because we do feel very 
confident she said 
the department investigation was prompted by a complaint from a 
northern virginia teenage girl who had been told she could not 
apply to the school 
former gov gerald l baliles told the vmi board last may that 
the admissions policy was illegal he included 160000 in his 
proposed 199092 state budget to provide barracks for women at 
institute 
his successor gov l douglas wilder has declined to take a 
position 
a bill to force vmi to admit women will come before the senate 
committee on education and health on thursday but the bills 
sponsor sen emilie f miller said she has little indication of 
much support for the measure 
most people are tiptoeing around it she said

city council rejected a proposal to sell 
hundreds of guns confiscated in crimes since 1977 and to use the 
proceeds to buy new weapons for the police department 
they tried all kinds of public tricks to get it passed but it 
didnt work out said city council president ray denczak 
mondays 75 vote came despite an amendment that would have 
ordered about 350 small easily concealable saturday night 
specials destroyed because of questions about the legality of 
selling them 
some council members worried that the guns might be used again 
to commit crimes 
an affirmative vote would have authorized the guns sale to the 
highestbidding licensed gun dealer 
the city tried to sell the guns last year but decided against it 
when the highest bidder offered only 31000 for the lot about 
half its estimated worth 
the police department has 1048 confiscated guns in its storage 
room

federal drug officials are trying to block 
exports of certain chemicals to 52 latin american companies because 
the solvents are being used to process cocaine a newspaper 
reported today 
the solvents include methyl ethyl ketone manufactured primarily 
by exxon corp and shell oil co the los angeles times reported 
citing unidentified sources 
the move was authorized under new legislation and targets about 
one in five of the companies that were regular importers of us 
industrial solvents the newspaper said 
disclosures indicating the extensive role of usoriginated 
chemicals in south american cocaine production were scheduled to be 
revealed today in a us senate subcommittee hearing looking into 
such chemical exports the times said 
the drug enforcement administrations action could force south 
american companies to turn to european suppliers 
us manufacturers argue they double check to make certain their 
international customers have legitimate uses for the solvents but 
a senior official with the chemical manufacturers association said 
us exports often are diverted to cocaine producers 
it can happen that products are sold to a customer who seems 
legitimate and that the product then is diverted into illegal drug 
marketing r garrity baker the associations director of 
international activities said monday 
the 52 companies were among 288 described as regular 
customers for us exports us officials in bogota colombia 
said many of the businesses were fronts for colombian drug cartels 
regular customer status allows latin american companies to 
receive us shipments with less documentation removing the status 
effectively bars them from receiving exported solvents dea 
officials told congressional investigators 
the dea refused to identify the companies the date of the 
customer status reclassification was not reported none of the us 
exporters affected have challenged the ban 
the times reported earlier that 90 percent of the 13 million 
gallons of methyl ethyl ketone exported to colombia last year was 
believed to have been used in cocaine laboratories 
sen harry reid dnev last week introduced legislation to 
outlaw export of the chemical sen richard h bryan dnev 
responsible for the subcommittee hearing probing the exports said 
he will urge the president bush to bring up the chemical export 
issue during his drug summit in colombia 
this is a serious problem and there is more that the united 
states can do bryan said

a judge signed a death warrant against double 
murderer robert alton harris for what could be californias first 
execution in 23 years 
superior court judge jesus rodriguez on monday ordered the 
execution for april 3 for the 1978 abduction and murders of two 
teenage boys 
were really up against the gun now said michael mccabe an 
attorney for harris 37 theres no question that weve been up 
and down both the state and federal habeas corpus appeal system 
more than anyone else 
harris one of 273 inmates on san quentins death row was 
convicted in the 1978 shootings of michael baker and john mayeski 
both 16 according to testimony harris abducted the boys as they 
sat in their car at a drivein restaurant drove them to a remote 
area shot them and then laughed about it as he munched on their 
unfinished lunch 
last week rodriguez denied a defense request to delay setting 
an execution date 
three previous dates the last set for 1982 were dissolved 
during appeals charles sevilla another defense attorney said a 
request for a stay of the latest date would be filed soon with the 
california supreme court 
in its fourth consideration of the case the us supreme court 
last month cleared the way for harris execution when it refused to 
hear his appeal 
sevilla said harris is aware time may be running out 
hes understandably frightened of this process sevilla 
said but if he has to go as hes said he will go to the best 
of his ability with dignity its very difficult when youre about 
to be killed to go out with dignity but hes going to try to do 
that 
the last person executed in california was convicted police 
killer aaron mitchell who died in san quentins gas chamber in 
1967 
sevilla said the most appropriate sentence for harris would be 
life in prison without parole 
an emotional barrier will be broken if there is an execution 
which i think will psychologically open the floodgates to many 
more to come and there are about 250 people on death row so a lot 
rides on this case sevilla said 
i say killing an individual is a very cruel event it was a 
cruel event for which mr harris was convicted and the state is 
now going to repeat that event 
deputy attorney general louis hanoian who has opposed harris 
appeals for the state disputed sevillas comparison 
the cruel act was the murder of two young boys hanoian 
said they received no trial no appeal no mercy mr harris has 
had 11 years of due process since he committed these brutal murders 
and the state can take away his life having given him due process 
in a telephone interview from prison harris told radio station 
kfmb last week that the killings are not something i have 
relished over 
im very tore up about this not only did they die on that 
day i did too 
the father of victim michael baker police detective steve 
baker said he doesnt believe harris expressions of remorse 
hes lying through his teeth said baker who added he plans 
to witness harris execution im sure he regrets being caught 
but thats about as far as it goes 
harris latest appeal to the state supreme court includes claims 
that the death penalty is no longer appropriate because he has 
reformed while in prison and because he has been under the threat 
of execution for so many years that to carry it out now would be 
cruel and unusual punishment 
we are not attempting to simply delay the inevitable we feel 
that there are strong constitutional issues that have to be 
resolved mccabe said 
the state has until feb 16 to file its response and the 
defense then has 30 days from then to file its rebuttal

the bush administration today 
embraced as a pretty good idea a proposal by west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher for reunification with east 
germany 
a senior us official traveling with secretary of state james 
a baker iii said the french government also seemed taken with 
genschers plan to keep germany in the north atlantic treaty 
organization but without moving western troops into what is now 
east germany 
genschers proposal also would permit the soviet union to keep 
forces in what is now east germany where some 390000 are now 
based how long they might remain is not clear 
baker discussed the fastmoving german situation with french 
foreign minister roland dumas at a refueling stop in shannon 
ireland and then flew to prague for talks with leaders of 
czechoslovakias velvet revolution from hardline communism 
toward democracy 
the us official who spoke with reporters on condition that 
his name not be used said we think that proposal in terms of 
not having nato forces move farther east is a pretty good one 
the official said one of the virtues of genschers plan is that 
it would maintain germany in nato a condition set down by baker 
on reunification we think that is a very positive 
contribution the official said 
asked about dumas appraisal of the plan the official said 
he didnt specifically address that issue but id say from the 
tone of it it was positive he continues to believe nato has a 
very positive role in germany 
the support given genschers approach was noteworthy because 
until now the bush administration had been noncommittal about the 
future of the two germanies baker has stressed only the importance 
of a nato role and a peaceful evolution 
the official acknowledged that developments were moving so 
rapidly that after east germany holds national elections next month 
there is an extraordinarily high probability that the soviet 
ally will be pressing for reunification with west germany 
you can expect a very quick process dealing with economic 
political and legal aspects between the two german states he 
said 
in prague baker arranged meetings with president vaclav havel 
the dissident playwright chosen leader of the central european 
country in the collapse last december of the communist party and 
with cardinal frantisek tomasek and leaders of the civic forum 
he also scheduled a speech wednesday morning at charles 
university before flying on to moscow to begin four days of talks 
although the bush administration was withholding an appraisal of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs call in moscow for the 
communist party to release its iron grip on the soviet union us 
officials subtly voiced support for support for political 
pluralism the likely result if the communist partys central 
committee follows through on gorbachevs initiative 
gorbachev appeared to soften his opposition to german 
reunification last week and baker is certain to probe the issue 
with him and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
france vanquished twice this century by german military might 
is observing with keen interest the quickening course taken toward 
unification by west german and east german leaders 
bakers 27hour visit to prague meanwhile is designed to show 
us support for the smooth transition from a hardline communist 
state to an emerging democracy 
havel is demanding the withdrawal of the estimated 75000 soviet 
troops in czechoslovakia as part of a complex disarmament scheme 
that also might require even deeper cuts in american forces in 
central europe than president bush proposed last week 
bush would set a ceiling of 195000 on us and soviet forces in 
the area 
his national security assistant brent scowcroft said over the 
weekend that was the bottom line figure but havels plan could put 
pressure on both the united states and the soviet union to go 
further 
baker meanwhile is ready of offer czechoslovakia economic 
support beginning with a lowering of us trade barriers last 
month prague asked for readmittance to the world bank and the 
international monetary fund after a 35year absence but according 
to government officials it is more in need of expert advice than 
credits 
in his speech wednesday baker is expected to register us 
support for gorbachevs proposal for a 35nation summit meeting 
later this year 
the idea is to reduce eastwest tensions even further baker is 
likely to stress a need also for more action on human rights by the 
soviet union

official ousted during the november revolution for his part in 
crushing czechoslovakias 1968 reforms has committed suicide the 
state news agency said today 
the body of viliam salgovic 70 was found by his wife hanging 
in the laundry room of his home in the slovak capital bratislava 
late monday ctk said a preliminary investigation suggested 
salgovic acted alone it added 
salgovic a former member of slovakias communist party 
politburo was the first senior member of the leadership that 
crushed reform after 1968 known to have committed suicide following 
last falls peaceful revolution

november while former prague communist party boss antonin kapek 
was hospitalized with severe injuries after trying to shoot himself 
last month 
salgovic a longtime member of senior communist ranks served as 
deputy interior minister during the 1968 prague spring reforms 
of alexander dubcek in this post he is thought to have controlled 
the state security forces and served as czechoslovakias link to 
the soviet kgb secret police 
zdenek mlynar a member of dubceks leadership who now lives in 
austria charged in his memoirs of the 1968 invasion that salgovic 
served as a virtual soviet agent 
after the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that crushed dubceks 
policies salgovic assumed a series of high offices in slovakia 
becoming a member of the politburo in that republic and chairman of 
its parliament 
like all the other senior figures associated with the post1968 
crackdown salgovic lost those posts in the november revolt which 
ended the communists 41year monopoly on power and installed a 
coalition government that pledged to organize free elections

after months of combing want ads and 
finding he was too old or too qualified for academic positions 
romanian defector paul petrescu says he was glad to find work as 
groundskeeper at a country inn 
the job which sometimes means shoveling snow and sweeping 
halls might seem like a comedown for a man with two doctorates 
five languages and an authoritative knowledge of romanian folk art 
but the 69yearold defector is happy to have the work 
it is very healthy exercise said petrescu who has 
doctorates in sociology and political science from the university 
of bucharest but now calls himself dean of the eightman grounds 
crew i was a soccer player in my time i feel like im on a 
sports team we are friends 
and despite the revolution in his homeland he plans to stay 
petrescu and his wife juliana decided to try to leave romania 
three years ago the plan was for petrescu to leave first 
establish himself in the west and then send for his wife and son 
when he was allowed to join a lecture tour in switzerland 
petrescu took the opportunity to slip into the west german embassy 
and was granted a visa through his contacts in that country but 
the west german government was reluctant to issue visas for 
petrescus family so 11 months ago he applied for political asylum 
in the united states 
he came to stockbridge in the berkshire hills by way of his 
friendship with local resident john c ffrench who met petrescu 32 
years ago at a traveling romanian folk art exhibit in india 
petrescu got his job at the red lion inn by answering a 
newspaper ad last summer said betsy holtzinger inn general 
manager 
hes so intelligent and gifted and yet he is willing to do 
this work she said petrescu does odd jobs such as shoveling 
snow and raking leaves in season and works as a gardener for 
owners john and jane fitzpatrick holtzinger said 
petrescus wife and 20yearold son have been granted permission 
to enter the united states and he took a month off at the beginning 
of this year to arrange for their travel they are expected to join 
him soon 
petrescu said he was shocked at the speed with which revolution 
swept eastern europe in romania people took to the streets in 
december in a fight that led to the execution of dictator nicolae 
ceausescu and his wife 
that was the hope only he said we hoped this for so long 
time 
he said that although he has always opposed the death penalty 
he did not think the deaths of the ceausescus were too hasty 
for 25 years they destroyed romania economically and also 
biologically the genocide they accuse him of is real it is not a 
political metaphor 
petrescu doesnt have any immediate plans to return to romania 
saying he would rather stay here and find a way to use his 
education and knowledge 
at the romanian folk art museum in evanston ill museum 
president rodica perciali was delighted to hear of petrescus 
whereabouts although she said it could be difficult for him to 
find an outlet for his specialized knowledge 
his books are some of the most important to romanian 
culture she said 
petrescu said he recently received good news about his writings 
which had been banished after he left the country 
my son called me he said i was just in the bookstore and 
your books are back on the shelves petrescu said

a lawmaker intends to show philip morris 
inc just what a long way consumers have come by sending the 
cigarette makers datebooks to classrooms for a lesson in the 
politics of persuasion 
the calendars built around the virginia slims theme youve 
come a long way baby feature pictures of fashionably and 
scantily clothed women with cigarettes 
two years ago state rep anne seibert collected the calendars 
and returned them to the company on the grounds they were sexist 
and promoted a deadly habit 
a letter sent by seibert and 65 other lawmakers calls the books 
demeaning to women their history and their accomplishments 
and inappropriate mementos for lawmakers grappling with issues like 
health care and medical costs 
however seibert said recently the materials could inform 
students about sexism in advertising and about cancer risks with 
big profit motives behind them 
teacher carol barbagallo said she plans to use the datebook to 
teach rutland town elementary school fifthgraders about drug and 
alcohol abuse 
were looking for healthy children and a healthy future for 
children she said 
part of the goal in barbagallos 20lesson program is to look at 
how advertisers sell the public on a product the children will 
clip and discuss ads from popular magazines and look at materials 
such as the virginia slims datebook 
i call it tobacco humor said seibert a democrat their 
theme is youve come a long way baby but they only picture women 
smoking in various fashion outfits 
the calendars list what virginia slims considers important dates 
in womens history including aug 26 1920 the day women won the 
right to vote and the day in 1968 when virginia slims were 
introduced 
seibert said that approach belittles the accomplishment of the 
womens suffrage movement 
a telephone call to enud houminer president of philip morris 
tobacco division in new york was not returned 
philip morris also has sent lawmakers copies of the bill of 
rights complete with the company name at the bottom 
seibert said these too would be sent to vermont schools after 
removal of the commercial endorsement that defaces the replica 
of this historic document

reports 
paul weaver of the newspaper today and gareth furby of 
independent radio news were admitted to south africa on temporary 
permits 
home affairs minister gene louw said both journalists had sent 
reports intended to damage south africas image he said 
weavers reports were emotionally laden and exaggerated and 
called furbys dispatches distorted 
weaver was given a work permit to cover the visit of the english 
cricket team touring the country in defiance of an international 
sports boycott 
louw said that furby had entered to country under false 
pretenses saying he had come to visit friends when he was actually 
sending out reports on the cricket tour and other events 
he said weaver had filed a report which appeared to be a first 
person account of police action against anticricket tour 
demonstrators at the jan smuts airport in johannesburg when the 
reporter had arrived at the scene two hours after the incidents

a second man alleges he had sex with the roman 
catholic priest who founded covenant house the nations largest 
runaway shelter 
darryl j bassile 31 of ithaca claimed the encounters 
occurred after he had sought refuge as a teenager at covenant 
house the new york times reported today 
roman catholic church officials are investigating the new 
charges the times said 
the rev bruce ritter denied bassiles allegations calling him 
a sick kid 
on monday the shelter conceded that it provided a dead boys 
indentity to a former male prostitute who was the first runaway to 
allege he had sex with the franciscan priest 
bassile said that in april 1973 when he was 14 he met ritter 
after entering a covenant house branch in greenwich village 
he said he visited ritters apartment to discuss his anguished 
past and that on his second visit ritter made sexual overtures on 
the third visit ritter fondled him and they engaged in a sexual 
act bassile said he said they had sex several times after that 
ritter said he remembered meeting bassile briefly and recalled 
only one conversation with him in which the teenager asked the 
priest to marry him to a man in a wheelchair 
the priest also has denied allegations brought by former 
prostitute kevin kite who has said ritter gave him money housing 
and gifts in exchange for sex kites father has described his son 
as an emotionally troubled liar 
prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating whether 
covenant house funds were used for ritters personal benefit 
the organization founded by ritter in 1968 manages 17 shelters 
with more than 2000 beds in the united states canada and latin 
america serving about 25000 young people annually making it the 
nations largest runaway shelter its 85 million annual budget 
comes mainly from private donations 
more questions have arisen with the disclosure shelter officials 
provided kite with papers for a new identity 
on monday the shelter confirmed that the identity was that of a 
dead 10yearold boy officials refused to say how they got copies 
of the childs birth records 
covenant house said it had meant no harm to the parents of the 
dead child timothy warner of jamestown who said they learned from 
a reporter about the use of their childs identity 
the poor kids dead he suffered so i wish he was still here 
and heres somebody going around using his name said the boys 
mother betty anne warner i dont think its fair 
ritter has said he tried to help kite get off the streets in 
december ritter said i even gave him the name of timothy 
warner on a new birth certificate so that he could get his life 
started again 
mrs warner said she and her husband learned of the matter only 
last week she said they contacted the fbi and have been 
interviewed by a new york city prosecutor 
timothy warner died of leukemia in 1980 it was unclear how 
covenant house may have obtained copies of his birth record and 
baptismal certificate 
only a minors parents their lawyer or someone with a proven 
legal interest can legally obtain birth certificate copies state 
health department officials said mrs warner said she has the 
originals 
stanley arkin ritters lawyer said it would be legal to use 
such records as long as it was not for illegal purposes

former gov ed herschler a democrat who 
won a record three terms in the staunchly republican state has 
died at the age of 71 
herschler died monday at laramie county memorial hospital after 
an extended bout with cancer according to hospital spokesman dave 
hall 
herschler was wyomings only threeterm governor a poll in 
1986 his last year in office showed he was the states most 
popular politician 
in 1986 the democrats had hoped to capitalize on his popularity 
by having him seek a fourth term or challenge republican us sen 
malcolm wallop in 1988 but herschler declined the offers saying 
the party needed new blood 
herschler entered state politics in 1961 when he won a term in 
the house of representatives after eight years as a county 
prosecutor in 1970 herschler lost his house seat but returned to 
claim a surprising victory for governor four years later 
herschlers first term as governor coincided with the mineral 
industrys rapid growth which was spurred by world oil prices 
he was credited with pushing through the republicancontrolled 
legislature the creation of the wyoming community development 
authority 
during his second term herschler supported legislation 
establishing the framework for the states water development 
program and expressed growing concern over federal intervention in 
state affairs 
herschler garnered nearly half the republican votes cast in the 
1982 gubernatorial election to defeat former wyoming house speaker 
warren morton and win his unprecedented third term 
but he battled financial troubles during his last term as the 
18500acre yellowstone ranch which he coowned failed and forced 
him to file for bankruptcy in september 1985 
in his bankruptcy petition the former governor listed debts 
totaling 59 million

trans world airlines inc chairman carl icahn 
says he will buy new jetliners and expand the carriers operations 
if twa pilots agree to 80 million in wage concessions according 
to a published report 
icahn said he needed the concessions because twa lost more than 
200 million in 1989 the st louis sun reported in todays 
editions with the lower pilot pay and other savings he said the 
airline could break even in 1990 
icahn said in an interview that if the pilots reject the 
concessions he will step up plans to sell more of the airlines 
assets including marginally profitable routes and some aircraft 
icahn has asked the airlines 3500 pilots to take a 10 percent 
wage cut give up vacation days and make concessions in their 
retirement benefits all worth about 80 million 
the request comes three years after the pilots gave up 
concessions that totaled 500 million union officials said monday 
they werent interested in more pay cuts 
weve given up concessions twice and both times hes 
promised to grow the airline said william compton chairman of 
the negotiating committee for twas chapter of the air line pilots 
association he didnt live up to his promise in 1986 so we have 
a hard time believing hes going to live up to his promise this 
time 
with more concessions icahn said his longrange plans for the 
airline would include adding another major hub operation in 
addition to st louis as well as acquiring another major airline 
the fate of the airline whether it grows or shrinks is in 
the pilots hands icahn said we can shrink the airline or 
shrink the costs 
shrinking the costs will allow twa to follow through on a plan 
to acquire up to 100 narrowbody jetliners icahn said 
airline analysts have said that one of the keys to twas 
longterm survival is new aircraft the airline flies the nations 
oldest fleet of jets the average age is 147 years and needs to 
reinvest in new equipment to attract passengers and decrease 
operating costs analysts said

the interim government is permitting 
more free enterprise than ever allowed in 45 years of communist 
rule under a new decree but it is for now keeping large 
enterprises in the hands of the state 
the development of free initiative is meant to improve and 
develop and vary products and services under freemarket 
circumstances said the national salvation front 
the fronts 11member executive bureau has been ruling romania 
since the bloody december revolution that toppled communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu 
the decree signed monday by interim president ion iliescu read 
on staterun television will allow privatelyowned businesses with 
up to 20 employees the law which takes effect immediately is 
aimed at improving the living standards of romanias population of 
23 million by offering a wider assortment of goods and services 
in another move to improve living standards the front announced 
that the lowest level of pensions for peasants would be increased 
the monthly pension of 28 will be doubled but is still far below 
the average national monthly salary of 336 
during the 24year ceausescu dictatorship basic foods and other 
commodities became a scarcity especially in the last eight years 
when ceausescu became determined to pay off romanias 11 billion 
foreign debt 
ceausescu allowed a very small number of individual businesses 
to operate with a maximum of two or three employees in recent 
years however many shoemakers and tailors had to close because of 
high state taxes and chronic shortages of material 
the interim leadership made clear that it plans to keep 
romanias large enterprises including steelworks shipyards and 
food processing plants stateowned at least until the may 20 
elections decide who will govern the country

the archdiocese of washington says it will 
excommunicate any catholics who join rev george a stallings jrs 
breakaway africanamerican catholic congregation 
the archdiocese announced monday that stallings and his 
followers had been excommunicated over stallings public break from 
the roman catholic church 
by his public declaration that he has separated himself from 
the church and by his renunciation of church teaching father 
stallings has excommunicated himself the archdiocese said in a 
statement by vicar general william kane 
any catholic who would knowingly and willingly renounce his or 
her catholic faith to become a full and active member of father 
stallingss congregation would also incur automatic 
excommunication the statement said 
excommunication which excludes a person from the sacraments and 
rights of the church is the roman catholic churchs most powerful 
weapon against defiant members the statement said members of 
stallings congregation could resume participation in the catholic 
church only if they go to confession and do penance 
stallings a dissident black priest publicly criticized the 
churchs treatment of blacks last summer when he formed his imani 
temple an independent congregation he announced his decision to 
break all ties with the vatican last week 
on sunday stallings said his congregation of several hundred 
followers would observe new church laws women would be allowed to 
be ordained as priests he said and his congregation will allow 
the practice of birth control and abortion 
in addition he said he would permit optional celibacy which 
means our priests will be able to decide whether or not they want 
to marry 
stallings will respond to the archdioceses action in a 
television interview tuesday night said william marshall his 
spokesman stallings told the washington post last week 
suspension and excommunication are all political tactics used 
by the powerful to further enslave and oppress the oppressed 
those terms have no meaning or significance to me whatsoever i 
cannot be cut off from jesus christ 
the last prelate to incur public excommunication was swiss 
archbishop marcel lefebvre according to msgr john tracy ellis a 
historian lefebvre was excommunicated in 1988 after he consecrated 
four bishops for a new religious community that rejected the 
teachings of the second vatican council

this country is in the throes of the 
first known epidemic of childhood aids caused by contaminated blood 
and the constant reuse of needles a french humanitarian 
organization says 
dr jacques lebas president of the parisbased doctors of the 
world on monday urged the international health community to 
provide romania with disposable needles and bloodscreening 
equipment 
we know aids from people who take drugs homosexuals and 
heterosexuals in africa but for the first time in the history of 
aids we are confronted with childhood aids he said 
its an epidemic he said its on the level of famine 
its an international emergency 
doctors said they do not know how many children have aids but 
that at one hospital alone 33 of the 45 people who have died of the 
disease since 1985 were young children 
in geneva a world health organization spokeswoman said the un 
agency has sent two experts to bucharest to investigate the extent 
of aids among romanian children spokeswoman therese gastaut said 
the visit which began monday and is expected to last about a week 
was requested by the romanian health ministry 
the romanian outbreak is unusual because it does not involve the 
transmission of the virus from mother to fetus the manner in 
which most children around the world are infected but from 
contaminated blood transfusions and needles he said 
in the adult population the incidence of aids is very low 
lebas said adding that more than 98 percent of mothers of infected 
children do not carry the virus 
blood transfusions are routinely used in romania as a treatment 
for premature babies sick children and the thousands of youngsters 
suffering from malnutrition he said but needles are in short 
supply and are routinely used hundreds of times encouraging the 
spread of the virus 
like other east bloc nations romania is short of disposable 
syringes and other medical supplies 
lebas said romanias aids outbreak was considered a state 
secret under communist dictator nicolae ceausescu who was 
toppled in a bloody revolution in december and executed on 
christmas day 
last month dr ludovic paun of the infectious diseases 
department at bucharests victor babes hospital said 69 people 
treated there had developed aids since 1985 among them 53 young 
children he said 33 of the 45 aids fatalities so far were children 
3 or younger 
lebas did not have updated statistics on aids deaths but he 
said an initial screening of 1025 children up to 3 years old at 
several hospitals and orphanages found 367 with the virus that 
causes aids human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
dr ion patrascu a researcher at the institute of virology 
said 60 percent of the 283 children with hiv who are hospitalized 
have fullblown aids the children in orphanages who tested 
positive for the virus will be checked this week to see whether 
they have developed the disease he said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims vulnerable to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers a person can carry the hiv virus for years without 
developing aids but almost all cases lead to the disease 
children have been tested in bucharest arad in western romania 
focsani in the northeast and the southern black sea port city of 
constanta where the incidence was very high patrascu said tests 
would be carried out at hospitals and orphanages in timisoara and 
other cities this week 
this outbreak is unusual in the world he said we need 
specialists to come here from the united states france britain 
and other countries to decide what to do 
doctors of the world signed a contract with the romanian 
government on monday to set up a laboratory in bucharest to test 
for pediatric aids he said 
but romania has no money to carry out a proper epidemiological 
study to determine the real number of aids cases in the general 
population patrascu said 
we hope when the general population is tested we wont have 
this result lebas said 
he said he secretly took blood samples in july to test for the 
aids virus in children and was not able to confirm his results 
until after the revolution when the french organization took 29 
samples to paris 
patrascu said the contaminated blood came from romanians 
although at first it was thought it came from foreign students 
lebas said one pint of blood from an adult could be used in 
transfusions for up to 15 children

military facilities on defense secretary dick cheneys list of 72 
possible base closures or cutbacks a list disclosed the same day 
bush sent congress a proposed 292 billion defense budget for 
fiscal 1991 
while bush said his spending blueprint offers a chance to 
restructure americas defenses in the wake of the revolutionary 
shift toward democracy in eastern europe it envisions troop 
reductions of only 38000 in the year ahead and cutbacks in 20 
minor conventional weapon programs while seeking 1 billion in new 
funds for star wars research and moving ahead on major weapons 
systems after inflation it amounts to a 2 percent defense cut 
bush also proposed last week to bring 50000 more us troops 
home from europe but did not set a timetable in any event those 
savings would not show up in the 1991 budget

said they will press for larger defense savings

challenge remains very much real their strategic buildup is 
continuing this is not a time to lay down our arms

the soviet union fitzwater said thats the whole reason for 
this trip that our posture is changing and he wants a chance to 
explain it

billions to put the mx missiles on rails and building the new 
multiwarhead midgetman missile

nuclear deterrent fitzwater said

list are in districts represented by democrats in the house 
but fitzwater said for those who are interested in a peace 
dividend theyre seeing that thats where part of it will come 
from 
bush also will attend a breakfast fundraiser for nebraska gov 
kay orr in omaha on thursday and tour a head start facility in

wounded in the fighting today between troops loyal to gen michel 
aoun and the lebanese forces militia of samir geagea bringing the 
overall toll to at least 299 killed and 1087 wounded 
most of the casualties have been civilians caught in the 
crossfire 
aouns command said its troops had crushed the last pockets of 
resistance among the lebanese forces in the northern suburb of 
dbaye 
the lebanese forces conceded the loss in a communique saying 
its fighters were ordered to redeploy north of dbaye it said 
aouns hysteric shelling transformed dbaye into ruins 
the hotel dieu hospital the largest in christian east beirut 
issued a statement saying its morgue was packed with decomposing 
bodies and the situation was worsened by a power failure 
we find ourselves obliged to bury the victims in a mass grave 
in ashrafiyeh wednesday if no one shows up to collect them the 
hospital said in a statement broadcast by the christian voice of 
lebanon radio 
the international committee of the red cross french 
humanitarian minister bernard kouchner and maronite catholic 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir issued separate calls for an immediate 
ceasefire 
todays barrages targeted the militiacontrolled residential 
districts of ashrafiyeh jemmayzeh karantina and ein rummaneh

he said geageas gunners were responding by shelling the 
aounheld districts of sin elfil furn elshubbak hazmiyeh and 
fayadiyeh as well as the eastern suburb of baabda which houses the 
general headquarters 
heavy rains helped put out small fires in east beirut but palls 
of thick black smoke billowed out over the mediterranean from 
blazing fuel and cooking gas depots in the aounheld dora district 
on the northern edge of east beirut 
aouns tanks stormed through lebanese forces defenses in dbaye

liberal communist party leaders today attacked 
mikhail s gorbachevs daring plan for ending the partys monopoly 
on power as not radical enough to solve the countrys pressing 
problems participants said 
but politburo member yegor k ligachev a hardliner called for 
a careful review of the soviet presidents proposals to 
fundamentally alter this nations system of government 
gorbachev on monday opened a pivotal session of the central 
committee by proposing the party abandon its monopoly on power and 
be forced to compete with other parties for the right to lead the 
country 
some speakers at todays central committee session criticized 
the platform saying it was based on old dogmas said alexander 
fomin a coal miner invited as a guest to the meeting 
there were not enough radical proposals to solve the partys 
problems fomin said summarizing todays debate he offered 
during a break in the closeddoor session 
he did not detail the objections and the soviet media carried 
no details of todays session 
another participant gen igor i kurenoi said ligachev who 
last week came under attack in a newspaper for his conservative 
views called in a speech for reviewing gorbachevs proposals 
carefully 
libachev also pointed out shortcomings of the leaderships 
policies but did not propose solutions fomin said the official 
news agency tass said 16 people spoke today including ligachev and 
several other politburo members 
gorbachev as expected is in the middle of an intense struggle 
between progressives and conservatives over whether to completely 
abandon the centralized system of government in favor of a 
multiparty political system with a more capitalist economy 
the session has taken on crisis proportions because of the 
worsening soviet economy and a rise in ethnic unrest throughout the 
country it comes on the heels of a breathtaking series of revolts 
against old orthodox socialist governments in six east bloc nations 
meanwhile the communist party leader in the siberian city of 
sverdlovsk resigned because he refused to embrace reform the 
newspaper trud reported today last week party members had charged 
the sverdlovsk leadership with antidemocratic policies and passed 
a vote of no confidence 
soviet media have reported several resignations of party 
officials increasing calls for greater democracy and shortages 
throughout the soviet union have made citizens more sensitive to 
the performance party officials 
on monday gorbachev told the partys policymaking central 
committee that by letting outmoded ideas govern their policy 
socialist countries had during the 20th century isolated themselves 
from the general flow of civilization 
but his proposal met with stiff resistance in the largely 
conservative 249member body one participant said committee 
members did not applaud gorbachev or anyone else on the first day 
of the twoday closed session 
speaking confidently just days after rumors swept the world that 
he might step down as party chief gorbachev on monday presented a 
new political program for the communist party based on a bill of 
rights 
man and his wellbeing are put in the center of the partys 
policy from now on and forever he said the speech released 
later by tass did not detail the rights he wants to enshrine in 
the partys platform 
gorbachev did not suggest that the party give up efforts to lead 
the country instead he said it intends to struggle for the role 
of ruling party but strictly in the framework of the democratic 
process rejecting any kind of legal or political advantage 
at some point he said growing pluralism can lead to the 
creation of parties 
gorbachev called for an end to a tenet of leninism called 
democratic centralism which demands strict allegiance by the 
partys 20 million members to decisions made at the top 
he said the partys views on managing the economy and the 
government should no longer be pressed on soviet society 
the communists have been widely assailed for the dismal state of 
the economy and for widespread abuses of power 
gorbachev acknowledged that the country which suffers severe 
shortages of consumer goods has not seen any fundamental 
improvement from the economic reform program he has championed 
since coming to power in 1985 
he said key obstacles to those changes were old attitudes and 
the failure to reform prices 
transcripts released by tass indicated gorbachev underwent 
immediate stinging criticism one committee source said leningrad 
party chief boris gidaspov who has become a lightning rod for 
conservatives demanded the establishment of strict law and order 
the soviet ambassador to poland vladimir i brovikov told the 
committee that democracy without discipline is unthinkable because 
it leads to chaos tass reported today 
in his speech gorbachev advocated a stronger presidency for the 
soviet state according to svyatoslav fyodorov a participant in 
the meeting 
many people think he hopes eventually to step down as head of a 
no longer supreme communist party and find a new power base as 
president with the support of elected legislative bodies 
participants said they expected easy approval of gorbachevs 
proposal to drop article 6 of the constitution which guarantees 
the communist party the leading role in society 
final approval for the plaform would come at the next party 
congress which gorbachev suggested moving up to june or july from 
the fall a new central committee is expected to be seated at the 
congress giving gorbachev the opportunty to remove aging 
hardliners and replace them with supporters 
he also said the central committee would meet again in about a 
month and consider creating a smaller nearly fulltime central 
committee 
voters are expected to soundly reject communist candidates in 
local elections this spring and gorbachev clearly wants to move 
quickly to reform the party before it loses more credibility 
premier nikolai ryzhkov acknowledged monday that the country 
already has moved toward a multiparty system with alternative 
parties cropping up in many places 
such parties have been active in the baltic republics and in the 
southern caucasus where gorbachev sent troops last month to put 
down a nationalist uprising in azerbaijan and quell ethnic rioting 
more than 1000 people including 100 nonvoting members of the 
central committee military district commanders and local party and 
government officials attended the meeting a participant said

all los angeles students will have to go to 
school yearround by 1991 to ease overcrowding in the nations 
secondlargest district 
in a fourhour session marked by namecalling and shouting the 
board of education voted 43 monday to put all schools now on 
traditional schedules nine months of class and three months 
summer vacation on a fullyear calendar 
nearly 100 schools already follow yearround schedules under 
which students go to school for three months take the following 
month off and so on for the rest of the year about 500 schools 
are on regular schedules 
the vote was met by opposition from hundreds of parents who 
feared children in the same family would be placed on varying 
schedules making coordination of babysitting and vacations 
troublesome 
i think this is going to drive us more toward a twotiered 
education where you have folks in private school and the people in 
public school are there because they dont have the money to go to 
private school said pam bruns a leader of a parents group in 
the affluent pacific palisades area 
the los angeles district which ranks behind new york citys 
with 610000 students becomes the biggest in the nation to move to 
yearround classes the plan endorsed by superintendent leonard 
britton would increase the districts student capacity by 62000 
in the next two years 
its very difficult because each of our areas has different 
problems different points of view board member julie korenstein 
said at the same time we have a district thats incredibly 
overcrowded and we have to come up with some way out 
board members rita walters and leticia quezada argued that the 
plan unfairly targets minority students attending overcrowded 
campuses 
about 95 percent of those students already attending yearround 
schools are minorities quezada said but only 16 percent of the 
first batch of students slated to convert to a yearround schedule 
are white she said 
sometimes we try to ignore reality and the reality is it is a 
racial issue she said whether or not you want to accept it 
it is a racial issue 
the plan requires all public schools on traditional schedules to 
submit plans for yearround classes in time for the 199192 school 
year 
each school will be free to stagger its schedule with some 
grades in class and others on vacation so that the building is in 
continuous use 
the superintendent had called for 109 schools with severe 
overcrowding to adopt a yearround schedule by july but the board 
voted to give those schools until july 1991 to make the conversion 
members acknowledged that adopting a continuous calendar 
districtwide could set a precedent for other urban school systems 
the time had to come when the issue has escalated to what it 
is today said board member roberta weintraub as los angeles 
goes as a school district so goes the nation

the fbi is poring over lists of auction 
bidders in a search for the manual typewriter linked to two mail 
bombings 
we are no longer conducting largescale searches but were 
still there in pretty substantial numbers fbi agent tom moore of 
birmingham said monday of the investigation of the mailbomb 
slayings of a judge and a lawyer 
federal agents believe the typewriter was used to write 
threatening letters sent by the bomber following a list of 
registered bidders agents monday began tracing typewriters sold at 
auctions at the nearby fort rucker army base and looked over three 
typewriters at a piano store 
store manager dean powers said fbi agents were interested in 
typewriters bought at auction at fort rucker he said the agents 
examined one electric typewriter and two manual typewriters but did 
not remove them from the store 
the mail bombs exploded in december killing 11th us circuit 
court of appeals judge robert vance near birmingham and lawyer 
robert robinson of savannah ga 
during the past two weeks scores of agents searched homes 
businesses a lake schools a trash dump and even septic tanks in 
a hunt for the typewriter 
the fbi probe in enterprise has focused on a junk dealer robert 
wayne oferrell and print shop operator brian joseph fleming who 
has been indicted in a separate case on charges of trying to 
illegally export firearms 
ken holder a fort rucker spokesman said typewriters are sold 
at periodic auctions on the base he said that oferrell was a 
registered bidder at the auctions but that anyone who has a junk 
business probably would show up at the bidding 
i cant locate whether he purchased anything the spokesman 
said 
oferrell said he had been to at least three sales at fort 
rucker and had purchased typewriters 
he has denied any knowledge of the bombings 
he came under scrutiny because he had an employment compensation 
case that he lost on appeal before a threejudge panel of the 11th 
circuit including vance and because of alleged similarities in 
oferrells typed correspondence and letters apparently sent by the 
mail bomber 
oferrell last week acknowledged that he used at least four 
typewriters in filing his own legal documents with the 11th 
circuit but he said the one agents looked for at his business 
could have been sold 
in atlanta on monday about 200 judges lawyers friends and 
relatives of vance passed through tight security to attend a 
memorial service in a federal courtroom a few feet from vances 
chambers

israeli soldiers sealed rooms in two 
palestinian homes today in a new army policy that lets authorities 
close all or part of houses where residents are suspected of 
hurling rocks at troops 
another palestinian was reported killed today when a civilian 
opened fire on rock throwers who attacked his truck in the west 
bank 
trade minister ariel sharon leader of a hardline faction in 
the rightwing likud bloc called for egypt to be excluded from 
middle east peace efforts saying it backs the palestine liberation 
organization 
his spoke as bereaved families buried victims of a weekend bus 
attack outside cairo egyptian authorities said they were searching 
for two palestinian suspects in the attack in which nine israelis 
died when their tour bus was raked with gunfire and grenades 
the new policy on sealing homes which could affect hundreds of 
families in the west bank and gaza strip drew immediate criticism 
from civil rights groups and liberal politicians who said the 
measure amounted to collective punishment 
in the nearly 26monthold uprising the army has razed or 
sealed hundreds of homes to punish arabs suspected of fire bombings 
or serious attacks but the penalty was not used for stone 
throwing the most common tactic of teenagers at the forefront of 
the uprising against israeli occupation 
in nablus mustafa abed kulab 45 was fatally shot in the neck 
arab reports said the reports initially said kulab was shot by 
israeli soldiers but later reports indicated he was shot by an 
israeli driver after his fuel truck was stoned 
the army confirmed the death but said its troops were not 
involved 
kulabs death raised to 652 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians since the palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation began in december 1987 
in addition 181 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaboration with israel fortythree 
israelis have died 
the new housesealing policy was announced by col ahaz benari 
the armys legal adviser for the west bank he said it was 
necessary because of the danger of stone throwing 
because this phenomenon is still deeply rooted and lately to 
our great regret is on an increase it was decided to widen this 
sanction for this phenomenon in an attempt to quell it benari 
told israel radio 
according to army figures at least 395 houses have been 
demolished or sealed since the uprising began al haqlaw in the 
service of man a palestinian group that monitors human rights 
abuses in the territories puts the total at 550 or more 
as benari was announcing the new rules the army said that 
troops had sealed rooms in two homes of suspected stone throwers 
they included a house in nablus where a family member is 
accused of shattering the windshield of a car and injuring the 
israeli driver and another in qalqilya where a stone thrower 
injured a border policeman army reports said 
in each case one room was left open for the families 
the new rule was immediately challenged by parliament member 
dedi zucker of the leftofcenter citizens rights movement zucker 
described the policy as another escalation of the circle of 
hate and said it constituted punishment without trial 
khaled batrawi al haqs specialist on house demolitions said 
the demolitions and house sealings are illegal they constitute 
collective punishment that is prohibited by international law and 
they violate the 4th geneva convention 
the 4th geneva convention which israel signed protects the 
rights of civilians during war and under occupation 
the united states and international human rights groups also 
have repeatedly criticized demolitions and sealings noting the 
action almost always takes place before the suspect is tried

were edited to understate the danger to humans 
marc a lappe professor of health policy and ethics at the 
university of illinois said monday that he found that malathion 
could cause six extra cases of cancer for every million people a 
figure later reduced to one additional case 
lappe said in an interview with the los angeles times that his 
findings indicated the health risk from malathion spraying is six 
times greater than what the report officially concluded he said he 
resigned in 1981 because of the changes 
the public has been ramrodded into accepting this without 
their basic right to have a full airing lappe said it could 
be quite dangerous to infants the elderly and the infirm 
however ephraim kahn lappes supervisor at the state health 
department in 1980 said that the original findings had been based 
on false assumptions that the chemical could cause cancer and on 
overly negative presumptions that children would be drenched with 
it during night spraying 
the implication that his numbers were changed to hide some 
serious effect is just ridiculous kahn said 
state health researchers used worstcase probabilities in the 
1980 report to be on the conservative side lappe said 
lappes public reversal bolstered claims by malathion opponents 
that repeated aerial pesticide sprayings aimed at medflies could 
cause illness among residents in affected areas 
lappe has filed an affidavit in support of a lawsuit brought by 
the orange county cities of garden grove huntington beach and 
westminster to stop the aerial pesticide missions against the 
cropdestroying mediterranean fruit fly 
he did not say why he did not come forward sooner 
state officials on monday announced plans to create a southern 
california panel that would study the air and water in spray areas 
and advise the state on any dangers the panel will include local 
health experts 
five helicopters took to the sky overnight on a spraying mission 
in glendale sun valley and burbank the spraying is going on 
throughout los angeles and orange counties 
agricultural officials warn that the medfly in los angeles and 
orange counties threatens californias 16 billion farm economy 
the medfly lays its eggs in more than 250 kinds of produce 
dr james stratton an epidemiologist with the state department 
of health services said the national toxicology program determined 
in a 1985 study that a cancer risk from malathion virtually could 
not be detected 
researchers at the national cancer institute discovered a 
slightly higher risk of cancer from malathion exposure in rats and 
mice but reported no significant link between the pesticide and 
cancer in humans

a small leak of the chemical that killed 
3500 people in india in 1984 has revived fears by residents of 
chemical valley that they are sitting on a time bomb 
this is another bhopal waiting to happen said mildred holt 
copresident of people concerned about mic were living in 
terror 
seven workers were injured when methyl isocyanate leaked friday 
morning at the former union carbide plant along the kanawha river 
about 10 miles west of charleston the leak was not announced until 
monday 
the workers suffered burns to their eyes said plant manager ron 
bearer two required hospital treatment and were released 
the ouncesize leak occurred as workers were performing 
maintenance on the methyl isocynate unit at rhonepoulenc which 
purchased union carbides agricultural products division in 1986 
bearer said the plant did not have to file a report with 
emergency officials because the leak involved less than a pound of 
material he said the incident was considered to be of such little 
importance that he wasnt notified until hours afterward 
it was such a minor thing the alarm didnt even go outside 
of the unit my office is in the middle of the plant and i wasnt 
aware of it until today rhonepoulenc spokeswoman bonnie 
blashford said monday 
paul pribyl manager for brown amp root construction of houston 
whose workers were injured said it is plant policy to notify 
personnel when potentially hazardous work is being done nearby 
for some reason it wasnt followed in this instance there was 
some sort of breakdown in communications he said the brown amp 
root workers were building a new unit elsewhere in the plant 
complex 
bob weser of the state air pollution control commission said 
there was no cause for alarm because the material stayed within the 
plant complex 
others expressed concern about the reporting delay 
i think we have a problem said mark wolford kanawha county 
public safety director 
plant officials said the leak was so small they felt it was 
not in the reportable quantity wolford said we are still in 
the process of investigating this and are asking the plant to meet 
with us 
the chemical is an ingredient in agricultural pesticides a 
december 1984 leak at a nearly identical union carbide plant in 
bhopal india killed 3500 people 
an august 1985 leak of a different chemical in union carbides 
pesticide plant in institute injured 135 in that incident 
officials were angered that it took the plant nearly 20 minutes to 
notify emergency services 
chemical valley gets its name from the more than two dozen 
chemical plants along a 15mile stretch of the kanawha river

government leaders have proposed a 
new constitution that abolishes the communist partys 45year 
monopoly on power in favor of a multiparty system an official said 
today 
stipe suvar a member of yugoslavias ruling collective state 
presidency told a press conference that the new constitution would 
also regulate a procedure under which a yugoslav republic might 
se forward by the eightmember presidency will start in the 
federal parliament on feb 14 suvar said 
he added however that no one knows when the new 
constitution would be adopted since it needs the approval of all 
six often factious yugoslav republics and two provinces to be 
passed 
the proposals come at a time of seemingly irreconcilable 
differences between the republics the communist party in slovenia 
on sunday broke away from the national party and declared itself 
independent 
the current constitution adopted in 1974 during the rule of 
yugoslavias communist founder josip broz tito granted wide 
autonomy to the republics and is generally blamed for the countrys 
worst political and economic crisis in history 
parliament earlier this month started began liberal amendments 
on political activity and free speech to the current constitution 
proposed by the reformist government of premier ante markovic 
the amendments which also call for westernstyle democracy 
will only facilitate the adoption of the new constitution 
suvar said 
he said he expected the amendments to be passed in spring just 
ahead of the countrys first free multiparty elections after world 
war ii scheduled for april 
yugoslavias communists were the first to break with the 
sovietled east bloc in 1948 but the country has been slower in 
adopting democratic reforms than other east european countries 
because of deep ethnic and economic divisions 
liberalminded slovenia has expressed increasing frustration at 
resistance to reform by the largest republic serbia and there are 
increasing indications slovenians might want to secede from the 
rest of the federation 
the new yugoslav constitution will precisely define the 
complicated procedure of secession suvar said adding that a 
regional referendum within a republic might become a legal way for 
it to break off from the rest of yugoslavia 
in yugoslavia the federal government is generally responsible 
for economic policy while the collective presidency which appoints 
the premier dictates defense and foreign policy 
but the bulk of political influence in the country is 
concentrated in the communist pparty with power dispersed in eight 
often fractious central committees reflecting the administrative 
division of the country 
the government essentially follows guidelines set by the party 
bodies that must themselves hammer out a consensus before any 
policies can be implemented

the 550 million gamma ray 
observatory arrived aboard a giant cargo plane today for liftoff 
next year on a mission to help scientists unlock the secrets of the 
universe from high above the earth 
the 17ton observatory was trucked from trw inc in redondo 
beach calif which built the satellite to los angeles 
international airport on monday it was flown aboard an air force 
c5a to the kennedy space center 
it is scheduled to be placed in earth orbit in november by space 
shuttle atlantis and will be the heaviest spacecraft ever deployed 
by a shuttle said trw spokeswoman montye male 
the gamma ray observatory is the second of the national 
aeronautics and space administrations great observatories which 
the agency says will help scientists understand the birth and 
structure of the universe and the origin and evolution of stars 
planets and life 
the first great observatory is the hubble space telescope which 
is scheduled to be launched from space shuttle discovery in april 
the others are the advanced xray astrophysics facility which is 
to be launched from a shuttle in 1997 and the space infrared 
telescope facility scheduled for launch from a rocket in 1999 
each of the observatories will detect a different form of 
electromagnetic radiation visible light gamma rays xrays and 
infrared light which is heat 
the hubble is an incredibly powerful optical telescope that will 
look back almost to the beginning of time to study light from stars 
and galaxies 
the gamma ray observatory will be equipped with four detectors 
to spend two to eight or more years studying gamma rays emitted by 
various processes in space including the big bang which is 
the gargantuan explosion scientists believe created the universe 
about 15 billion years ago 
gamma rays are called the messengers of creation because when 
the big bang started everything off gamma rays were emitted 
male said she said the observatory will conduct a comprehensive 
scientific effort to learn more about the origin and fate of the 
universe 
through the gros instruments humankind may be able to 
witness the birth of elements the death of stars and discover 
clues about quasars pulsars and black holes she said 
most of the elements that make up earth and all living things 
were created by the death of stars in fiery supernova explosions 
pulsars and black holes are the incredibly dense remnants of 
supernovas quasars or quasistellar objects are mysterious 
sources of vast amounts of light and other energy 
the observatory is now 15by30by15 feet but once its solar 
panels are deployed when it is in its 279milehigh orbit the 
observatorys width will grow from 30 to 70 feet male said 
trw built the observatory under a 250 million nasa contract 
the total cost will be 550 million once its gamma ray detectors 
are installed in florida she added

west german chancellor helmut kohl called 
today for immediate talks with east germany on combining their 
currencies in an effort to stop people from fleeing the 
economically crippled communist nation 
kohl made the announcement during a meeting with leading 
politicians of his christian democratic union and the allied 
christian social union he said details will be worked out when 
east german premier hans modrow visits bonn next week 
discussions on using west germanys robust currency to revive 
replace or reinforce the comparatively puny east german mark have 
grown more intense as the communist countrys economy nears 
collapse 
earlier today the influential president of west germanys 
central bank said it was too early for a monetary union that would 
make the west german mark east germanys currency 
deutsche bundesbank president karl otto poehl also said he is 
opposed to the idea of introducing the west german mark as a 
parallel official currency in east germany he spoke to reporters 
after talks in east berlin with horst kaminski president of the 
east german central bank 
the east german economy has been crippled by a continuing exodus 
of skilled workers to west germany strikes and abstenteeism more 
than 50000 east germans moved west in january alone joining more 
than 340000 others who resettled in west germany last year 
east german economic output is expected to drop by between 4 
percent and 5 percent this year the government says east germany 
has asked west germany for immediate aid of up to 88 billion but 
a west german spokesman has called the request unrealistic 
east germans are impatient with the pace of reform and have been 
drawn to the west by the prospect of earning valuable west german 
marks instead of the inconvertible east german marks 
poehl said the east german mark would have to be made gradually 
convertible before monetary reform is achieved 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann was quoted as 
saying today that the west german mark could become a parallel 
currency in east germany as early as this year if the east 
german government is willing to take such a step 
haussmann said the step was needed to stem the exodus to the 
west according to the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper 
but central bank officials have taken a far more cautious 
approach on monetary union stressing that major economic reforms 
must be undertaken first by the east german government 
in davos switzerland wolfgang berghofer mayor of the east 
german city of dresden today proposed making the east german mark 
convertible as the only way to avoid a complete collapse of the 
east german economy 
berghofer said the quickest route to make the east german 
currency convertible would be to link it to the west german mark at 
a fixed rate of four east german marks to one west german one 
speaking to reporters berghofer said hopelessness and 
desperation prevailed in east germany and warned that the country 
only has a matter of days to give its citizens a measure of 
reassurance to avert an even larger exodus in the spring 
berghofer was in davos attending an international economic forum 
late monday about 100000 people rallied in leipzig with many 
speakers and demonstrators calling for quick reunification the 
official news agency adn reported 
adn said a group of ultrarightist republicans from west germany 
joined the rally marching with their arms raised in the nazi 
salute

environmentalists immediately denounced the remarks 
the was more talk in the speech about economics than the 
environment said daniel becker of the sierra club calling the 
presidents remarks a gross disappointment 
sen albert gore dtenn a frequent critic of the 
administrations environmental record accused the president of 
moving as slow as molasses on concerns by many scientists that 
manmade pollution accumulating in the atmosphere threatens to 
significantly warm the earth by the middle of the next century 
what were hearing is talk of another year of waiting i 
expected a lot more concern about the global warming problem 
said rafe pomerance of the world resources institute 
bush speaking to the 60nation intergovernmental panel on 
climate change said our policies must be consistent with 
economic growth he complained that in some areas of the debate 
over the greenhouse effect politics and opinion have outpaced 
the science 
our goal continues to be matching policy commitments to 
emerging scientific knowledge and a reconciling of environmental 
protection to the continued benefits of economic development the 
president said promising to convene a white house conference on 
global warming in the spring 
james tripp a lawyer for the environmental defense fund said 
bush failed to demonstrate the political will necessary to make 
the united states a leader in the effort to prevent global 
warming 
but tom lambrix head of the global climate coalition an 
industry group called bushs view of global warming an 
appropriate balance 
we need a better understanding of the economic and social 
implications of dealing with global warming said lambrix 
director of government relations for the phillips petroleum co 
the united nationssponsored conference of technical experts is 
meeting to work on a proposed treaty to deal with global warming 
reilly issued a statement saying the presidents remarks made 
clear his determination to lead the world in addressing global 
climate change 
bush does not believe it is time for a call to arms on 
global warming but instead favors continued research presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters after the presidents 
remarks 
but many environmentalists argue there is enough scientific 
evidence to warrant a commitment from the united states and other 
industrial nations to reduce global warming gases especially 
carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels 
scientists fear such an accumulation of manmade pollutants will 
act like a greenhouse trapping heat and reflecting it back to 
earth causing a warming of the globe scientists disagree on how 
severe the warming will become or its effect although some 
scientists predict droughts in some interior regions and coastal 
flooding because of higher ocean levels 
reducing greenhouse gases would require less reliance on coal 
oil and natural gas and would require industry to develop more 
energyefficient automobiles and industrial plants which industry 
fears could result in widespread economic disruption

a top department of housing and urban 
development official acknowledged today that the federal government 
was probably defrauded when a new jersey housing authority gave its 
director four salaries for four job titles 
i think thats a reasonable assumption inspector general 
paul adams told rep tom lantos dcalif as congress resumed its 
investigation of the troubled federal housing system 
lantos chairman of the house government operations employment 
and housing subcommittee said the report on the passaic nj 
housing authority would be a starting point for hearings on 
abuses and mismanagement in the use of federal funds by local 
authorities 
we happen to be dealing with new jersey but we are not 
singling out new jersey lantos said 
he questioned how the executive director of the passaic housing 
authority paul marguglio could find enough hours in the day to 
perform two fulltime jobs and two parttime jobs and still 
have enough time left over to earn 47115 for timeandahalf 
compensatory pay 
a january audit of the passaic authority said marguglio had been 
paid salaries totaling 245000 in 1988 
a paul kane the regional inspector general who wrote the 
report said passaic officials defended marguglios multiple job 
titles saying the work has been completed 
the subcommittee last year heard revelations on the 
multibilliondollar scandal of influencepeddling fraud and 
mismanagement at hud during the reagan administration 
the subcommittees findings prompted attorney general dick 
thornburgh to ask a federal court last week to appoint an 
independent counsel to investigate fraud allegations against pierce 
and other hud officials 
on monday at the panels first hearing since october the 
former director of huds office of insured multifamily housing 
development refused to testify becoming the fifth former official 
to invoke his constitutional right against selfincrimination 
before the subcommittee 
james hamernick had been questioned about his dealings with 
another former hud official lance wilson once an aide to thenhud 
secretary samuel r pierce jr 
wilson quit his hud job to become a housing consultant for an 
investment firm in that position he wined and dined hamernick 
the audit of the passaic housing authority also outlined nearly 
1 million in unacceptable agency expenses 
passaic housing officials maintain the hud office in newark 
nj approved their budgets and was aware marguglio held multiple 
job titles 
housing secretary jack kemp on jan 22 suspended marguglio and 
four other passaic officials after the audit was released kemp 
also authorized a strike force to examine housing authorities 
across new jersey 
marguglio and his wife declined an invitation to testify at 
todays hearing if they do not agree to appear voluntarily at a 
second session the subcommittee will consider subpoenaing them 
said congressional aides 
three of passaics suspended housing officials august c 
michaelis chief counsel to the agency peter marrocco the 
authoritys chairman and william p scruggs the boards vice 
chairman declined to testify today but may be willing to appear 
later lantos said 
a federal judge in newark last week gave hud control of the 
authority allowing the federal government to temporarily oversee 
its operations and protect its records at the same time three of 
the suspended officials filed papers seeking reinstatement

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee charged today that the bush administrations 2921 
billion defense budget fails to match the new political realities 
at home or abroad 
rep les aspin dwis said the administrations argument that 
it needs a modernized force to get a ussoviet agreement on 
reducing strategic weapons no longer holds true 
you can get an arms control agreement without a robust 
strategic budget aspin said noting economic pressures in the 
soviet union to reduce defense spending and congressional 
opposition to the administrations proposed increase in strategic 
programs 
but defense secretary dick cheney said that without a strong 
strategic budget the united states might get a poor agreement that 
would not serve its best interests 
this administrations approach reflects old thinking rather 
than these new realities aspin said the problem is the budget 
doesnt match the political realities at home or abroad 
in their third appearance before a congressional panel in less 
than a week cheney and gen colin powell the chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff defended the administrations budget against 
charges that it is a poor response to the tumultuous changes in 
eastern europe and the diminishing soviet threat 
the notion that it is not responsive to the changes does not 
hold up cheney said 
there is new thinking in the pentagon powell said 
the defense secretary said monday the bush administrations plan 
to modernize its strategic forces reduce troop levels in europe 
and cancel some 20 conventional programs preserves the elements 
of what we think is essential in terms of protecting the nations 
security 
the budget proposal for fiscal 1991 would allow the united 
states to look back in a decade and say we did in fact undertake 
a builddown a careful orderly restructuring of our forces 
cheney told the senate budget committee 
democrats on the senate budget committee targeted the 
administrations call for an increase in funds for several 
bigticket strategic weapons including the b2 stealth bomber 
the strategic defense initiative and the two landbased nuclear 
missiles 
i think youre behind the power curve with regard to world 
events sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the budget 
committee told cheney 
the democratic chairman questioned why the administration wants 
to raise spending on sdi by nearly 1 billion to 45 billion and 
spend 55 billion for five b2 bombers and 28 billion for the 
multiplewarhead railgarrison mx missile 
the presidents budget also includes 202 million for the 
singlewarhead midgetman missile 
why dont we wait and see what kind of world were going to be 
living in in a very short period of time rather than going ahead 
and committing ourselves to these programs sasser asked 
cheney said the pentagon is reviewing the strategic programs and 
will decide later whether to scale them back 
i inherited all these systems cheney said thats what 
congress approved at the recommendation of the administration you 
have to look at each one on its merits in terms of deciding 
sasser suggested that perhaps the administration should push 
these programs off until your review is completed 
but a republican on the panel sen warren rudman of new 
hampshire took a different approach suggesting that an additional 
increase in strategic modernization might be in order 
when you have that kind of instability you dont drop your 
guard he said 
the administration also came under attack from some democrats 
for the presidents plan to reduce forces in europe to 225000 a 
cut of 80000 from present levels 
sen donald riegle dmich said further reductions in troops 
could result in considerable savings for the united states 
i dont think we can continue to afford maintaining nor 
should we nor do i think the threat as its now radically changed 
requires us to maintain anything like 200000 troops in europe 
riegle said 
cheney backed the presidents total and said the only way to

the government will require rural laborers 
seeking work in the cities to obtain licenses in an effort to stem 
rural migration and counter rising urban unemployment a labor 
ministry official said 
vice minister li peiyao said people from rural areas must have a 
license from a labor department and a temporary residence permit 
from police before being allowed to take city jobs the official 
china daily said tuesday 
li said the measures were aimed at preventing a mass exodus of 
rural laborers from further burdening overcrowded urban labor 
markets 
china officially put urban unemployment at about 3 percent at 
the end of 1989 up from 2 percent a year earlier as a government 
austerity plan halted construction projects and slowed down the 
economy 
a year ago millions of rural unemployed flocked to cities 
looking for scarce jobs in construction and factories contributing 
to rising health crime and housing problems more than 25 million 
converged on canton alone 
china has always required people seeking work in the cities to 
have residence permits but the regulation was often ignored in the 
past when the fastgrowing economy created a need for millions of 
peasants to fill manual labor jobs in urban industries 
the nations floating population of rural people moving in 
and out of cities has been estimated at 100 million 
the official guangming daily reported monday that 10 million 
peasants had returned home recently as the austerity program and a 
sharp economic downturn left them without jobs it said many had 
gone to work on water conservancy and other rural public works 
projects although millions more probably returned to farms which 
are plagued by a surplus of workers

inefficiency waste and poor returns are 
threatening chinas policy of making large staterun industries the 
vanguard of the nations economic development an official report 
said tuesday 
the government report quoted in the official media sounded one 
of the first notes of pessimism about a threeyear retrenchment 
program aimed at reviving central controls giving priority to 
staterun industries and slowing down marketoriented reforms 
per capita productivity rose only 16 percent in 1989 compared 
with 93 percent in 1988 while wages increased 14 percent and 
bonuses 23 percent according to the report 
production costs of staterun industrial firms covered by the 
central government budget jumped 224 percent a result of rising 
wage and material bills and 19 percent of statebacked enterprises 
were operating in the red compared with 13 percent in 1988 
the state statistics bureau said taxes and profit turnover from 
stateowned industry rose only 02 percent in 1989 
the communist partys official peoples daily quoted finance 
minister wang bingqian as saying the retrenchment program started 
in 1988 must increase economic benefits 
if in the course of rectification economic benefits still do 
not rise then you cannot say the aim of rectification has been 
completed he said 
the official china daily in a commentary noted that if 
efficiency in large stateowned firms continues to erode no 
matter how the government adjusts the economic retrenchment 
program would fail to achieve its purpose 
the government led by conservative premier li peng has 
insisted china wont veer from its socialist system relying on 
staterun enterprises and giving only a supplemental role to 
collective and private businesses 
but the figures showed that state firms longtroubled by 
inefficiency surplus labor forces and poor management are costing 
the state a huge amount of money 
finance vice minister chi haibin told the weekly beijing review 
the government must budget 19 billion a year to cover business 
losses and subsidies about onethird of annual financial 
expenditures 
the china daily quoted a chinese academy of social sciences 
economist as saying industrial efficiency has been declining since 
1985 and that in 1988 enterprises contributions to state revenue 
was only 2063 percent of state funding for industry compared with 
242 percent in 1984 
the economist said aggregate financial losses incurred by 
moneylosing enterprises grew from 723 million in 1984 to 25 
billion in 1988 
the daily said inefficiency and low productivity were due to 
slowness in adapting to new market situations low levels of 
technology and blind expansion during years of rapid economic 
growth 
it quoted former state economic commission minister lu dong as 
saying that more than 30 percent of the nations processing 
industry is idle a result of overcapacity and the 18monthold 
austerity program that has meant weakened demand and a cutoff of 
government credit 
the government report said newly granted state loans to industry 
totaled 394 billion last year exceeding the planned quota of 34 
billion 
twothirds of the new loans were issued in the last quarter of 
the year the last quarter is traditionally the main lending 
season but this trend was more pronounced last year as the 
government concerned by the first negative growth rates in 
industrial output in a decade eased up on its tight credit policy

despite lifting martial law chinese 
authorities persist in arresting peaceful dissenters and are 
carrying out new death sentences the human rights group asia watch 
alleged in a report obtained tuesday 
the washingtonbased group also criticized the bush 
administration for kowtowing to the chinese and it attempts to 
patch things up with those responsible for the slaughter and 
arrests following the june 4 crackdown 
asia watch said tens of thousands of dissenters are languishing 
in cramped jail cells where guards regularly torture them it said 
all political detainees are denied access to a lawyer as they await 
trial and are interrogated 
chinas criminal justice system is among the most deeply 
flawed in the word the report said indeed it is essentially 
premodern 
asia watch also accused chinese authorities of harassing many of 
the 40000 chinese students studying in the united states it 
printed one letter from a chinese student who claimed security 
forces went to his parents house in henan province and demanded a 
recent letter he had sent them regarding the june 4 crackdown 
after an allnight interrogation his brother gave police the 
letter and police later investigated his family and previous 
letters asia watch said 
the 89page report lists many political trials and executions 
occurring after the crackdown in june although it does not supply 
any new information as all of its findings are based on western 
press reports 
it says most of the estimated 10000 to 30000 people still in 
jail for taking part in the prodemocracy movement are workers who 
unlike many intellectuals and students have no contact whatever 
with the outside world 
the report titled punishment season said that despite the 
lifting of martial law in january the political climate throughout 
the country remains repressive it charges that many peoples 
liberation army soldiers have simply traded uniforms to the 
paramilitary peoples armed police it also charges that the 
peoples armed police has increased in strength 
the human rights group said it had documented several dozen 
arrests and trials between october and january including one man 
who was convicted of counterrevolution for painting 
prodemocracy slogans it said it had received reports but not 
confirmation of hundreds more 
it charges that several executions had occurred of men the 
chinese called hooligans who were killed for participating in 
the movement for freedom 
to sum up it said the continuing arrests and executions 
in china form the cutting edge of a protracted governmentled 
campaign of punitive repression and they serve a purely political 
purpose 
the report devotes one section to criticizing the response of 
the bush administration to china 
a month after the crackdown began president bush sent national 
security advisor brent scowcroft on a secret mission to beijing 
scowcroft returned to china in december 
bush responded to criticism of his policy by saying he did not 
want to isolate china 
asia watch accused the us government of cleaving to a flawed 
and outmoded strategic analysis which holds the maintenance of 
close ties with china to be the key to any successful containment 
of soviet expansionism 
it said such a policy has reverted to a shabby double standard 
insofar as the question of human rights in china 
the asia watch report follows the completion of a study by the 
us state department on human rights abuses in china according to 
press reports the study says the massacre in beijing and 
subsequent crackdown violated almost every internationally 
recognized human right 
the state department report will be released later this month

this wont come as any surprise to 
people who live here but jacksonville stinks 
so says a grand jury report that has been under wraps for 20 
months because of objections by four corporations to its findings 
it was unsealed monday by order of an appeals court after a 
challenge by the florida timesunion 
the report found that odors from jacksonvilles paper mills and 
other plants are an embarrassment and that industry has failed to 
police itself 
the 23member grand jury also found that the odors have hurt 
property values and interfere with residents health and enjoyment 
at the same time the panel indicted four industries on 
airpollution charges but the charges since have either been 
dropped or struck down 
the four industries were scm glidco organics corp jefferson 
smurfit corp seminole kraft corp and union camp corp 
the report was released after an eightmonth investigation 
requested by mayor tommy hazouri 
george robbins president of scm glidco said his company fought 
release of the report because it is grossly biased factually 
deficient and very misleading to the general public 
state attorney ed austin said he was not surprised that the 
industries fought release of the report so vigorously 
its been a mentality that they could wear us out and beat us 
down and not comply were showing the world were going to stay at 
it until we accomplish our objectives and that is to breathe fresh 
air he said 
the grand jury concluded that if industries fail to get rid of 
the stink city state and federal officials should pursue civil 
and criminal remedies

nelson mandela called 
president fw de klerks concessions to the antiapartheid 
movement courageous but does not believe they will lead to 
talks between guerrillas and the government a mandela associate 
said today 
the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches met with mandela today 
later boesak said the jailed african national congress leader 
described de klerks speech on friday during which he legalized 
the anc and lifted many emergency restrictiosn as bold 
couragous and hopeful 
but mandela does not believe the speech cleared the way for 
negotiations boesak said he has not given up on any of his 
principles boesak added 
he also said that although mandela has presented demands to the 
government he will accept freedom whether or not they are met 
his release is not in his own hands boesak said it is 
the responsibility of the south african government to release him 
earlier his wife winnie mandela had indicated that mandela 
had demanded a complete lifting of the state of emergency as a 
condition of his release 
boesak said mandela wants the government to end the 3yearold 
state of emergency and release all political prisoners including 
guerrillas convicted of acts of violence 
if these conditions are not met mandela would still agree to 
leave prison but he will state his unhappiness with the 
government boesak said 
cabinet ministers said today mandela will be released very 
soon but that the date hasnt been decided yet 
earlier today walter sisulu an anc leader who was freed in 
october after 26 years in prison said the anc has no intention of 
starting negotiations with the government and called on de klerk to 
make further reforms 
he said the anc would pursue its guerrilla campaign despite de 
klerks decision to legalize the group which had been banned since 
1960 
in his speech friday de klerk lifted bans or restrictions on 
more than 60 antiapartheid groups promised to free mandela and 
many other political prisoners ended restrictions on 374 
antigovernment activists and declared a moratorium on hangings 
the actions met most but not all of the ancs conditions for 
opening talks with the whiteled government de klerk did not say 
he would accept the principle of oneman onevote 
de klerk said anc members can return from exile and will not be 
arrested unless they have been accused of committing ordinary 
crimes however the government has not said who among the ancs 
estimated 15000 members in exile will be liable for prosecution 
sisulu said no anc exiles will return until the government 
clarifies its position he also said the group would formally 
establish offices in south africa but declined to specify a date 
meanwhile opposition among rightwing whites to de klerks 
concessions continued to grow on monday andries treurnicht the 
conservative party leader said south africas whites faced the 
hour of truth 
his party which won 31 percent of the white vote in september 
applied for a permit for a mass march in pretoria on feb 15 to 
launch a freedom struggle aimed at protecting whites from 
domination by the black majority 
several farright groups have vowed to resist de klerks 
reforms fears of an extremist blacklash increased after an attack 
sunday on the british embassy in pretoria 
five whites were arrested recently on suspicion of planning 
attacks against de klerk and other government leaders as well as 
antiapartheid activists 
most rightwing whites are afrikaners primarily of dutch 
descent they began settling in south africa more than 300 years 
ago and now account for 60 percent of the 5 million whites there 
are about 28 million blacks

the terrapin is a gourmet delicacy and key 
soup ingredient to some a noble creature and wonderful pet to 
others but to state environmental officials its a threatened 
species that needs protection 
the turtles salt water habitat is imperiled by development and 
its ranks are declining because of its regained popularity on some 
dinner tables 
the state department of environmental conservation recently 
issued regulations setting up a terrapin harvest or hunting 
season for diamondback terrapin 
under the regulations wouldbe terrapin hunters must buy state 
licenses and terrapin capturing is forbidden during the turtles 
nesting period in may june and july the regulations also set 
minimum and maximum size limits on captured terrapin 
we think that because of loss of habitat and loss of nesting 
areas in addition to a continued desire to eat them primarily 
with the ethnic groups and gourmet restaurants its survival could 
become a problem again said alvin breisch a state wildlife 
biologist 
this isnt the first time the turtles have been threatened by 
their own good taste said breisch 
they were completely wiped out in many locations in the early 
1900s said breisch the food fad kind of died off about the 
same time the turtles died off but theyve been slowly coming 
back 
in new york state the terrapins are found only in the brackish 
salty water off long island and at the mouth of the hudson river 
the dec doesnt keep a terrapin tally breisch said 
we dont know how many there are but theyre certainly not as 
numerous as they were 100 years ago he said 
jim vanabbema can see evidence of a decline just by going to a 
fish market hes a member of the new york state turtle and 
tortoise society which petitioned the dec to regulate terrapin 
capture 
many of our members had been alarmed by the quantity of 
diamondback terrapin that were sold in chinatown and other fish 
markets across the city said vanabbema editor of the 
20yearold societys newsletter plastron papers the plastron is 
a turtles bottom shell 
theyre not very big turtles seldom growing to more than 9 
inches long their scutes the individual pieces that make up 
their shells have very elaborate concentric patterns a 
distinctive mark on a terrapins face makes it look like it has 
white lips breisch said 
if you see the turtle it basks in the open water rather than 
crawling up on logs or sitting on the beach it basks just by 
floating on the surface and it sticks its head up and youll see 
the w hite lips if you see that youll know its a terrapin he 
said 
terrapins are not aggressive make good pets and can live 30 or 
40 years said vanabbema 
some of the turtle societys 1000 members are also concerned 
about the conditions in which the turtles are kept after capture 
said vanabbema who owns 18 turtles and a parrot 
they are kept at best in a dry tank maybe two or three layers 
deep sometimes even worse he said they are often in a 
diseased state they are in very poor health because of the 
extreme stress of being without food or water for weeks or longer 
the fact that turtles must be butchered shortly before cooking 
should contribute to their continued existence said breisch 
whoever buys them has to take them home and kill them and 
clean them said breisch turtle meat doesnt last very long 
after its been killed just like lobster meat 
i think that discourages a lot of people they actually 
wouldnt want to kill it themselves

mikhail s gorbachevs proposal to end the 
communist partys monopoly of power was an effort to keep ahead of 
a political avalanche that was threatening to bury him say us 
analysts 
changing article six of the soviet constitution to deprive the 
communist party of its guaranteed leading role as proposed 
monday by gorbachev would ratify rather than unite opposition 
groups scattered among the 15 soviet republics the analysts 
predicted 
but there was no clear consensus on the question of gorbachevs 
survival 
in the west where gorbachevs popularity is high his proposal 
will be interpreted as a show of great skill to enable him to 
prevail said adam ulam of harvard university but he is really 
trying to keep up with a bolting horse 
of course he has to survive in the lack of any alternative 
the right does not want to take a chance at cataclysm by removing 
him said ulam if they announced tomorrow that gorbachev was 
out you would have demonstrations in every russian city and 
that would force an unwanted test for the red army and kgb security 
forces 
a crowd estimated at 200000 marched through red square last 
weekend demanding more democracy an indication of the growing 
pressure on kremlin leaders to hand over more power to the people 
gorbachevs chances of success are mixed said jerry hough a 
duke university analyst who has described the soviet leaders 
political position as strong but he said the latest development is 
forcing him to reconsider 
if the communist partys constitutional grip on power is 
removed said hough there is no reason it should not have the 
result it did in eastern europe where communists are being 
forced from power 
gorbachev may be planning to surrender his job as general 
secretary of the communist party traditionally the top kremlin 
post and concentrate on his role as president an office which he 
has strengthened since taking over the party in march 1985 
but gorbachev may be miscalculating popular pressure toward more 
democracy and underestimating the backlash among russians who are 
angered by three things the collapse of the economy the weakening 
of the east european alliance and separatist movements in the 
nonrussian republics said hough 
if gorbachev in five years has done nothing but give up 
eastern europe and create economic chaos why shouldnt one decide 
that he is not worthy of running a great country said hough 
the communist party faces a test at the ballot box in local 
elections in the soviet republics in february and march the 
results promise to be just as embarrassing as those from national 
balloting last year when many communist functionaries were 
defeated in russia and popular fronts won majorities in the three 
baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia 
the communists are expected to lose again in the baltics as 
well as moldavia armenia azerbaijan and georgia said leon aron 
a sovietborn scholar at the conservative heritage foundation in 
washington 
aron predicted that depriving the communist party of its 
guaranteed leading role will cause it to collapse i give it half 
a year it could take longer 
the communists will be convulsed for months by the elections and 
by preparations for a party congress which had been scheduled for 
october but which gorbachev now wants in late june apparently 
immediately after his planned summit in washington with president 
bush 
the likely embarrassment of the elections and the expected 
foreign policy success of the summit may strengthen gorbachevs 
hand at the communist party congress where he will have his first 
chance in more than four years to clear his conservative opponents 
off the policymaking central committee it was at a meeting of the 
249member central committee that gorbachev proposed amending 
article six and thus sparked a conservative firestorm

the district attorney is seeking a pardon for a 
49yearold man who has spent five years in prison for an armored 
car robbery that police now say he did not commit 
the man martin kimsey wrote a letter that set in motion a 
chain of events that led investigators to another man 
i used to think everybody in prison was guilty and just saying 
they were innocent until it happened to me said kimsey who 
goes to court wednesday for a hearing that could lead to his 
freedom 
if district judge larry baraka sets bail kimsey will be free 
for the first time since 1985 when he was arrested for the robbery 
of a wells fargo armoredcar driver in the dallas suburb of garland 
kimsey read a newspaper account of similar robberies and wrote a 
letter in 1987 to one of the men convicted of them asking the team 
to admit to the garland robbery kimsey got no response but 
prosecutors got a call late last year from the wife of one of the 
men saying he wanted to confess to a crime someone else was jailed 
for 
i guess he sat on the letter or didnt do anything about it 
until he decided to talk to the fbi about it first district 
attorney norman kinne said tuesday 
investigators talked to james clayton garrett and said he 
provided details of the robbery only the robber would know he and 
kimsey passed a lie detector test before the pardon was recommended 
for kimsey 
kimsey said he wrote a thankyou note to garrett 
kimsey says he doesnt blame anyone for the wrongful conviction 
that has cost him five years 
i tell you what when i first got arrested i was bitter at 
everything kimsey told the dallas morning news but after five 
years youve got to go through everything in your mind you cant 
really change things 
i dont hold a grudge all i want to do is get out of here and 
get out of dallas kimsey said i want to get my life back 
together 
kimsey testified that he and his brother maurice were in fort 
worth when the robbery occurred and that his brothers car whose 
make and color matched a car seen at the robbery was in a body 
shop 
a dallas jury convicted kimsey in 1985 kimsey who had a record 
stemming from forgery and robbery charges was sentenced to life in 
prison 
a grand jury refused to indict maurice kimsey

talks on a global ban on chemical weapons resumed 
tuesday with european appeals for the united states and soviet 
union to increase efforts toward an agreement 
swedish envoy maj britt theorin told the 40nation conference on 
disarmament that longrunning negotiations on a convention could be 
completed within a year 
but in thinly veiled criticism of us policy theorin said a 
glaring loophole would result from proposals to allow states to 
keep some chemical weapons until all countries with a production 
capability sign the planned treaty 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said it is necessary 
to make it crystal clear that destruction of all chemical weapons 
is the principal objective of a convention 
we do not want haves and havenots he said 
the conference resuming full sessions after a fivemonth break 
also received offers from the hague and vienna to be the site of an 
international agency for monitoring adherence to a future chemical 
weapons ban 
the conferences spring session is set to run 10 weeks 
difficulties over verifying the proposed ban have been one of 
the main sticking points in completion of the treaty which would 
forbid the production stockpiling and use of poison gas 
negotiations in geneva date back to 1968 
improved superpower relations have boosted progress in 
5yearold bilateral talks between the united states and the soviet 
union and spawned hopes that an international treaty might be ready 
by the end of the year 
chief soviet negotiator sergei batsanov last month described 
talks as at a very advanced stage but he added that the 
superpower still disagree on an offer made by president bush to 
destroy 80 percent of stockpiles prior to the signing of an 
international treaty provided moscow follows suit 
in a speech to the un general assembly last year bush also 
proposed to keep two percent of us stockpiles of weapons until 
all countries deemed capable of producing chemical weapons have 
signed an international treaty 
without mentioning the united states ms theorin described this 
plan as potentially crippling a global accord 
she said it would leave a glaring loophole in the regime 
thereby providing an excuse for other countries to retain or to 
acquire chemical weapons the swedish delegate said 
about a dozen countries including libya and iran are thought 
to possess chemical weapons although only the united states and 
soviet union admit having the deadly substances 
van den broek offered to base the treatys monitoring agency in 
the hague seat of the dutch government and the world court 
foreign minister alois mock proposed vienna the headquarters of 
several un agencies and the venue for eastwest talks on 
conventional weapons 
theorin warned against optimism on an early signing of the 
convention 
we have become very familiar with the claim that the 
comprehensive chemical weapons convention will be concluded soon 
she said such statements cannot credibly be repeated forever by 
diplomats politicians and governments

a federal appeals judge asked government 
lawyers today why oliver north was not permitted to call former 
president reagan as a witness at norths irancontra trial or 
allowed to see written answers reagan supplied to investigators 
you never turned over answers from reagan to the defendant 
judge laurence silberman of the us circuit court of appeals told 
a government attorney during a hearing on norths appeal of his 
conviction 
why as a matter of basic fairness wasnt north permitted 
to examine written answers that reagan supplied to a federal grand 
jury investigating the irancontra affair the appeals judge asked 
a government attorney gerard lynch told the appeals court that 
the former presidents written answers would not have been helpful 
to north 
but the us system of justice is based on providing a defendant 
with a wide range of material for possible use in his defense said 
the judge 
what troubles me is we dont have a very good idea of what 
the presidents testimony would have been said silberman 
norths attorney barry simon argued that reagan should have 
been called to testify to show that he authorized keeping secret 
the us connection to a november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles 
from israel to iran 
reagans appearance had been called for at the time of norths 
trial last year but the trial judge gerhard gesell of us 
district court quashed a subpoena he ruled there was no evidence 
in the record to suggest that the former president authorized any 
illegal activities by north 
on monday us district judge harold greene ordered reagan to 
provide videotaped testimony at the trial of former national 
security adviser john poindexter the judge gave reagan and 
president bush until friday to invoke executive privilege to avoid 
testimony by the former president 
greene also renewed his order that reagan immediately turn over 
33 diary entries to poindexter reagan promptly invoked executive 
privilege to avoid turning portions of his diaries over to 
poindexter 
north was convicted on may 4 1989 of obstructing congress 
altering and destroying national security council documents and 
accepting an illegal gratuity 
silberman said that if north had been working for the secretary 
of state instead of the president there would have been no 
question that the cabinet member would have been called to testify 
lynch responded that north had no direct contact with reagan and 
that the former national security council aide formed 
impressions of what he was to do from his immediate boss 
poindexter 
the question is did the jury get sufficient information to 
make a judgment on norths guilt or innocence silberman said at 
one point in the appeals court argument 
norths attorneys contend reagans testimony would have been 
critically important in norths defense aginst the obstruction 
charge the defense contends reagan would have corroborated norths 
assertion that the president and his top advisers decided that in 
order to protect the lives of us hostages held in lebanon they 
wouldnt disclose us involvement with the november 1985 hawk 
shipment 
but irancontra prosecutors say north was unable to identify a 
single instance where reagan directly told him to obstruct congress 
on another point norths attorney asked the appeals court to 
overturn the former presidential aides conviction because of the 
pervasive dissemination of his congressional testimony 
witnesses jurors prosecutors and grand jurors could not avoid 
exposure to testimony north gave a congressional committee 
investigating the irancontra affair simon said 
north was granted immunity from prosecution for his 
congressional testimony prosecutors said they had not read or seen 
any of that testimony and had gathered their own evidence the 
congressional testimony was carried on live television and reported 
widely throughout the media 
in light of the pervasive dissemination there are no 
procedures that could ensure a fair trial simon argued 
he said grand jurors hearing testimony that resulted in 
indictments against north were not instructed to avoid reading 
newspapers or watching television instead he said the 
governments special prosecutor told the grand jurors to avoid 
tainted material or news that related to north 
they were told they could watch but if it came to tainted 
material then skip over it said simon you could read but 
when you get to an article that is tainted skip over 
he said the special prosecutor chose convenience instead of 
absolutely forbidding the grand jurors from reading newspapers or 
watching television 
the publicity was absolutely pervasive he said this 
grand jury was not shielded 
lynch the governments attorney responded that norths lawyers 
are equatingexposure with taint he called it overreaching 
of what the law requires 
the obstruction charge involved a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles 
to iran while the documents that were destroyed showed norths 
assistance to the nicaraguan contras the gratuity was a 13800 
home security system which north accepted from richard secord who 
north enlisted to run supplies to the rebels fighting the 
nicaraguan government 
gesell on july 5 placed north on probation for two years fined 
him 150000 and sentenced him to 1200 hours of community service 
north is performing the community service while appealing the 
convictions and fine 
the threemember panel hearing his appeal includes judges 
laurence silberman and david sentelle both reagan administration 
appointees and carter administration appointee patricia wald 
chief judge of the appeals court

a newspaper has reported that iran wants france to 
free an imprisoned lebanese before it will seek the release of 
american hostages in lebanon 
anis naccache is serving a life term for the attempted 
assissination of a former iranian prime minister the conservative 
daily le figaro reported monday that president francois mitterrand 
may trim the sentence to 20 years making naccache eligible for 
parole in 1991 when he will have served 10 years 
le figaro citing sources close to the foreign ministry said 
president bush told mitterrand that iran asked for naccaches 
release as a condition for intervening with iranianbacked 
extremist groups believed holding the captives 
president bush personally telephoned francois mitterrand to 
inform him of an unexpected change during talks that the americans 
held with tehran to obtain the liberation of their countrymen 
the newspaper said 
the name of naccache suddenly appeared from the iranian 
negotiators who made the release of their protege one of the 
conditions for a favorable outcome of the discussions the 
newspaper said 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said the story was nonsense total nonsense we dont make deals 
for hostages 
bush asked mitterrand whether the naccache affair might soon be 
settled le figaro maintained 
the french leader answered that nothing remains in the way any 
longer and that the release of the american hostages could be an 
extra reason to move things along the newspaper said 
le figaro did not specify when the conversation took place but 
said mitterrands response had reached beirut at the end of last 
week via the united states and tehran 
the story was the latest report in the french press that 
naccache will be freed after he recently ended a 19week hunger 
strike protesting his imprisonment 
naccache and senior iranian officials claim his release was part 
of the 1988 deal that won release for all french hostages then held 
in lebanon french officials deny that naccaches release was part 
of the package 
the weekly newspaper le canard enchaine reported last week that 
mitterrand would free naccache this year the french leaders 
promise was transmitted to naccache by way of the highest iranian 
leaders the newspaper said 
naccaches lawyer jacques verges has said iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani and spiritual leader ali khameini ordered an end 
to the hunger strike in which naccache was kept alive by 
occasional intravenous feedings 
mitterrand had said during the long fast that he might consider 
releasing naccache but not under the pressure of a hunger strike 
naccache born in beirut in 1951 led an assassination squad in 
a failed 1980 attack against shahpour bakhtiar irans last prime 
minister before the islamic revolution of 1979 bakhtiar was 
uninjured but two other people were killed 
at naccaches trial two years later both prosecution and 
defense lawyers said naccache acted under orders of senior iranian 
officials 
eighteen westerners are believed held by proiranian shiite 
moslem groups in lebanon including eight americans four britons 
two west germans two swiss an italian and an irishman longest

the government is delaying the 
release of nelson mandela to deal with his political demands and 
that could jeopardize its peace initiative an activist said 
tuesday after conferring with mandela 
the rev allan boesak said mandela wants the government to lift 
the state of emergency and free all political prisoners including 
those convicted of violent acts but would accept freedom whether 
or not these demands are met 
his release is not in his own hands boesak said it is 
the responsibility of the south african government to release him 
if his demands arent met mandela would still agree to leave 
prison but he will state his unhappiness with the government 
said boesak who is president of the world alliance of reformed 
churches 
if they come in here and they tell him we are releasing 
you he will not hold onto the chairs and tables and kick and say 
i wont come out but he will warn them if you do release me 
and the conditions that we have put have not been met then i will 
be obliged to make a statement on those conditions boesak said 
the government has made clear it wants mandela the most popular 
leader among south africas blacks to play a conciliatory role 
when he emerges after more than 27 years in prison president fw 
de klerks hopes of initiating negotiations on blackwhite 
powersharing could be dashed if a freed mandela were to take a 
tough stance against the government 
boesak said mandela did not know when he might go free but was 
engaged in intense contacts with the government 
he must be released soon or de klerk will lose momentum 
boesak said after he and his wife dorothy met with mandela for 
more than three hours at victor verster prison farm north of cape 
town 
de klerk in a speech friday lifted a 30year ban on mandelas 
african national congress movement eased restrictions on other 
opposition groups and said mandela 71 would be freed soon 
mandela considered the speech bold courageous and hopeful 
but did not believe it had cleared the way for talks between the 
government and the anc boesak said 
mandela has not given up on any of his principles boesak 
added he is a statesman whose place is not in prison 
gerrit viljoen the cabinet minister assigned to open 
negotiations with leaders of the voteless black majority said 
mandelas release is something that is to take place very soon 
the date of his release is to be determined as a matter of 
urgency viljoen said at a briefing tuesday 
in a later speech to parliament viljoen said he envisioned 
south africa being led by a coalition of parties in 10 years with 
the longruling national party no longer in charge 
viljoen and foreign minister pik botha challenged claims that 
the government was obstructing mandelas release by not repealing 
the state of emergency or freeing all political prisoners 
dont believe people who say the government is the only 
obstacle said botha he repeated de klerks assertion that 
mandelas safety and personal considerations were factors behind 
the delay 
on another topic botha said it did not matter whether a future 
president of south africa was black or white as long as the new 
political system had the support of a majority of the people 
walter sisulu an old friend of mandela who was freed in october 
after 26 years in prison said tuesday after returning from abroad 
that the anc leadership was not aware of mandela setting 
preconditions for his release 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life term 
for launching the ancs guerrilla campaign against the white 
government government officials agree with opposition leaders that 
his freedom is a key to creating a climate for negotiations on a 
new constitution ending apartheid and giving blacks a voice in 
the national government 
however sisulu said there is no question yet of direct 
discussions with the government he described de klerks reforms 
as a progressive step but unfortunately it was only a 
halfmeasure 
he said the organization was still studying de klerks speech 
and would need up to two weeks to issue a formal response 
he said the ancs armed struggle remained part and parcel of 
its campaign for black rights because nothing fundamentally has 
changed 
at the same news conference popo molefe a leader of the united 
democratic front said 20 leaders of the antiapartheid coalition 
would meet mandela on friday

its members names kept secret to guard against 
tampering a jury today began deliberating whether reputed mob boss 
john gotti ordered a union leader shot 
the jurors got down to work after the judge in the assault trial 
of the socalled dapper don told them you have only yourselves 
to answer to 
acting justice edward mclaughlin also granted a defense request 
and reminded jurors that the mafia was not on trial the judge told 
the jurors that to reach a guilty verdict they must find the 
prosecution proved the crime and not simply that gotti and his 
codefendant might be members of organized crime 
gotti known as the dapper don for his expensive suits is 
reputed to be the boss of the gambino crime family the nations 
most powerful mob organization 
mclaughlin told the jurors that that if they can face themselves 
the day after the verdict and feel good about what theyve done 
then they will have done their duty 
gotti said earlier that he wasnt worried about being convicted 
theres no problem gotti said after closing arguments 
monday theres never been a problem when the case began he 
said odds were 3to1 in his favor 
if convicted gotti faces 25 years to life in prison because of 
his prior record 
the jurors have been sequestered since being sworn in about 
three weeks ago to shield them from publicity and possible 
jurytampering and their names have not been disclosed court 
officials estimate the cost of their hotel food and transportation 
at 1200 a day 
in closing arguments defense lawyers bruce cutler and gerald 
shargel portrayed gotti as a noteworthy person who is being 
persecuted by prosecutors because of his reputation 
in their lust to convict mr gotti they created a case and 
they forgot integrity cutler told jurors in the mafia 
hysteria that they create and perpetuate they forgot what was 
right 
but the prosecutor assistant district attorney michael 
cherkasky insisted gotti had the motivation to arrange the 
shooting 
he said gotti 49 and codefendant anthony guerrieri 61 had 
the westies gang shoot john f oconnor former vice president of 
carpenters union local 608 on may 7 1986 
according to cherkasky oconnor was shot because he arranged 
the trashing of a mobrun restaurant bankers and brokers which 
used nonunion labor 
the defense ridiculed the quality of the prosecutions key 
evidence hardtohear tapes secretly recorded in 1986 at gottis 
hangout and in the visiting room at the rikers island jail 
the defense says a key sentence in which gotti allegedly says 
were gonna gonna bust him up is inaudibe shargel and cutler 
contend prosecutors are making it up to suit their theory 
the defense attorneys also asked why prosecutors didnt warn 
oconnor that his life was in danger or why gotti wasnt indicted 
in 1986 when the tapes were made 
when the smoke clears you will realize one thing that there 
is no proof let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt that john 
gotti and anthony guerrieri had john oconnor shot shargel told 
the jurors 
cherkasky explained the discrepancies by telling the jury law 
enforcement waited to have a case that came together 
gottis lawyers disparaged the truthfulness of the criminals who 
were called to testify saying they were lying to save themselves 
we are in america cutler said thats not how its 
supposed to be people are not supposed to be convicted because of 
who they are who their friends are what their background is 
the principal witness linking gotti to the oconnor shooting was 
james studs mcelroy 45 a former westies gang member who is 
serving a 60year federal sentence 
mcelroy testified that he was introduced to gotti as the westie 
who was going to whack oconnor 
cherkasky said of mcelroy the simple fact is this man is not 
smart enough not subtle enough to lie 
but cutler said mcelroy testified to help his girlfriend get 
favorable treatment in a drug case and increase his own chances of 
getting out of jail 
oconnor recovered from at least four shots in the buttocks and 
testified for the defense invoking his right against 
selfincrimination several times when crossexamined 
he has been charged with extortion perjury larceny and labor 
racketeering

thousands of people filled 
pragues old town square on tuesday and demanded the estimated 
75000 soviet troops be unconditionally withdrawn from 
czechoslovakia by may 31 
the soviet troops were denounced as occupiers who came to crush 
the prague spring reforms of 1968 
the crowd estimated at about 8000 by a western reporter and at 
30000 by the state news agency ctk applauded a speaker who 
demanded that vasil bilak and other former leading communists 
thought to have been responsible for inviting the troops to 
czechoslovakia be put on trial 
the new coalition government headed by president vaclav havel 
has demanded the withdrawal of the soviet forces by the end of 
1990 declaring void two 1968 agreements with moscow that legalized 
their deployment after they headed the warsaw pact invasion 
talks on the troop withdrawal resume in moscow on wednesday 
before havel makes his first visit to the kremlin at the end of 
this month to present plans for european change to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the crowd chanted thats the end ivan and nobody wants 
you and showed overwhelming support for a declaration demanding 
the withdrawal of the troops by may 31 supervised by a 
czechoslovaksoviet commission 
they also urged the restoration of all facilities used by the 
soviets to their original state all damage caused by the troops 
should be assessed and compensated said the declaration read to 
the crowd by social democrat slavomir klaban 
banners waving in the crowd read at home you will be people 
here you are just occupiers others in russian urged the troops 
to go home 
the demonstration which ended with a minute of silence for the 
72 czechoslovaks killed and 266 wounded in the 1968 invasion was 
organized by the social democratic party one of about 40 parties 
that have emerged since czechoslovakias peaceful revolution in 
november overturned oneparty communist rule 
the demands of the crowd went further than those of the 
coalition government which is pushing for a 50 percent withdrawal 
of soviet forces by midmay with the remainder leaving by years 
end 
the first round of talks on the withdrawal the most sensitive 
issue in czechoslovaksoviet relations took place in prague jan 
1516 but failed to produce tangible results 
unlike hungary where initial talks on a soviet troop withdrawal 
took place last week czechoslovakia considers the matter of soviet 
troop withdrawal separate from vienna talks on arms reduction in 
europe 
the soviet forces in both countries are viewed as occupiers who 
crushed movements for democracy in hungary in 1956 and in 
czechoslovakia in 1968 
the demands from prague and budapest for a soviet troop pullout 
have increased pressure on moscow for a radical cutback in central 
europe under discussion at the vienna talks 
us secretary of state james a baker iii who met havel on 
tuesday travels to moscow on wednesday for talks with gorbachev on 
the us proposal to cut us and soviet troops in all europe to 
225000 on each side with a limit of 195000 in central europe

in packaging big macs and other items 
but city attorney jeffrey l rogers argued that state policies 
on solidwaste management dont prohibit the city from banning 
foam the city contends foam food containers fill up landfills 
take generations to break down and are not recyclable 
mark l cushing representing the plaintiffs contended that the 
ban conflicts with state priorities for waste management he said a 
trial would prove that polystyrene foam is recyclable and his 
clients are recycling it 
mcdonalds and other foam users have argued that the alternative 
to foam is paper products which would end up at a landfill the 
last alternative on the state priority list

student protests over the dismissal of 
selmas first black school superintendent forced the closing of two 
schools today 
the action came a day after four protesters were arrested at a 
city hall demonstration and after officials canceled a board 
meeting when hundreds of protesters took over the stage at an 
auditorium the board planned to use 
a spokeswoman in mayor joe smithermans office said students 
were sent home this morning as demonstrators gathered at the 
predominantly black 1500student selma high school the citys 
only public high school 
eastside middle schools 400 students also were dismissed 
assistant superintendent james carter said 
officials were considering whether to close westside junior 
high which has some 900 students said the mayors office 
an unidentified worker who answered the telephone at the high 
school said protesters had left school grounds by late morning 
there were conflicting accounts as to whether demonstrators had 
entered the building 
no arrests were immediately reported 
students later gathered at a baptist church where a protest 
leader ronald peoples said parents had gone to the high school to 
remove their children because of allegations it was unsafe and 
not a learning environment 
the dispute began in december when the six white members of the 
selma board of education voted not to renew norward roussells 
contract when it expires in june that prompted the five black 
members who voted to retain roussell to walk out 
protesters have charged roussell was dismissed because he is 
black an allegation denied by white school board members they 
cited an unfavorable job evaluation and an authoritarian management 
style in his firing 
critics have organized school boycotts and other demonstrations 
one day last month more than a third of the systems 6000 
students stayed home the school system is 70 percent black 
last week the remaining members of the board decided to remove 
roussell from the 80000ayear job this week a move they said

west germanys labor chief on 
tuesday urged east germans to think twice before emigrating to the 
west because of the already overcrowded job market 
the continuing flood of east germans resettling in west germany 
has raised enormous concerns in both countries leading to warnings 
of serious economic and social problems 
federal officials say that so far this year 66000 east germans 
have emigrated to west germany an alarming average of nearly 
1800 per day arriving in one of europes most densely populated 
countries 
heinrich franke the head of west germanys federal labor 
office said 132100 east germans were registered as unemployed 
last month 
i appeal to all potential resettlers to consider their future 
job and housing possibilities before leaving the german democratic 
republic franke said in nuremberg 
whoever plans to resettle should not simply give up their old 
job and apartment and head off to the west by car he added 
as an added service to east germans franke said government 
employment offices near the border and in west berlin were 
counseling potential immigrants on their chances 
job opportunities vary widely for the newcomers 
east german craftsmen and bakers for example often take jobs 
that many young west germans snub 
but newly arrived physicians are finding a market so overcrowded 
that many have proposed sending doctors to east germany as a 
humanitarian gesture and as a way to keep the medical personnel 
busy 
franke added that east german factory workers and engineers were 
also having a difficult time finding work in west germany 
the overall west german unemployment rate climbed to 85 percent 
in january from 8 percent in december franke announced that meant 
that nearly 22 million workers were jobless in west germany 
west germany also has been coping with an influx of tens of 
thousands of ethnic germans from other parts of eastern europe 
including poland romania and the soviet union 
they accounted for 137500 jobless workers in addition to those 
from east germany franke said 
the influx straining the job market and the housing market has 
led to growing calls for curbs including appeals from saarland 
state governor oskar lafontaine 
lafontaine virtually certain to be the opposition social 
democrats chancellor candidate this year has said the country 
cannot maintain its opendoor policy indefinitely 
the social democrats economics expert wolfgang roth predicts 
the influx of east germans could jump even further in the coming 
weeks 
we have the impression that about 3 million gdr citizens east 
germans are sitting on packed suitcases roth said in an 
interview on saarland state radio 
roth a member of parliament added when spring comes and it 
gets warmer theyll get into their cars stick a tent in the back 
and drive into the federal republic west germany whether there 
are emergency shelters here or not 
reports from east germany have said that tens of thousands more 
people are ready to leave if conditions do not rapidly improve in 
their troubled homeland 
in bonn chancellor helmut kohl has been seeking a halt to the 
exodus which comes on top of more than 340000 east germans who 
arrived in west germany last year 
kohl previously insisted that any fundamental changes would have 
to wait until a democratically elected government takes over in 
east berlin even though free elections wont take place nearly six 
weeks 
on tuesday however kohl called for immediate talks with east 
germany on a monetary union between the two states to try to 
rescue east germanys crumbling economy and stop the growing exodus 
several state governments have proposed curbing the massive 
financial assistance paid to the east german resettlers and the 
ethnic german newcomers

floridas revenue director resigned 
tuesday over allegations she abused her powers denying wrongdoing 
but saying her battle with breast cancer and the prospect of a long 
fight left her little choice 
katie tucker 46 who served almost 20 months as chief of the 
department of revenue was under fire for ordering a 1988 tax 
investigation that singled out a former political opponent of her 
husbands 
i emphatically and unequivocally deny that i have ever abused 
the power of my office for any purpose ms tucker said i just 
feel like i was blocked at every turn 
the resignation does not necessarily end her troubles the 
florida department of law enforcement is investigating whether she 
tampered with documents in an effort to clear her name a 
thirddegree felony 
ms tucker and her attorney barry richard told gov bob 
martinez and the cabinet that the director could not defend herself 
against a perception of abusing her office and that she did not 
want to put her family through a protracted defense where right 
or wrong has little to do with the outcome 
she also brought up her ongoing battle with breast cancer 
noting her doctors said the additional stress of the battle to save 
her job could contribute to her health problems 
its not worth even a moment more of wasted energy on fights 
that can only hurt me she said god knows the truth has a 
purpose to all of this and god knows what you have lost 
despite previous statements that indicated ms tucker hoped to 
persuade the governor and cabinet to retain her richard said a 
monday night meeting convinced her there was no chance of that 
martinez who previously called for her resignation said ms 
tucker did not manage to convince him of her innocence and made 
contradictory statements about what happened 
if anything im more convinced now than i was at the time we 
suspended her that she no longer needs to stay at the state 
department of revenue the governor said i think it was not 
only the incident itself but how she went about trying to explain 
the incident that gives you great cause for concern 
deputy comptroller larry fuchs was named interim director 
fuchs 47 said he would not seek the job on a permanent basis a 
search committee is to find candidates for a replacement 
ms tucker was suspended by martinez and the cabinet two weeks 
ago to allow her time to respond to a department of law enforcement 
report on the tax investigation of businesses owned by donald g 
resha 
the fdle found that ms tucker committed no crime but ordered 
the tax probe against resha who lost a 1985 aflcio election to 
her husband daniel miller 
ms tucker has maintained she ordered a larger probe aimed at 
finding whether video stores such as those owned by resha were 
failing to pay taxes and whether they were involved in other 
criminal wrongdoing she denied the probe was a vendetta 
after reports that ms tucker had visited her office at night 
and was seen typing documents the fdle last week confiscated some 
files and her typewriter to find out whether any documents had been 
tampered with ms tucker denied the allegations 
as for her future ms tucker said she intended to take some 
time off to ski and to fish before deciding what to do next

jesse jackson said tuesday that south 
african president fw de klerks lifting of a ban on the african 
national congress is a sign of hope for the nations black majority 
the lifting of bans on the anc and some 60 opposition groups 
announced by de klerk on friday will help pave the way toward a 
new south africa jackson said in lusaka 
jackson is scheduled to travel to south africa on wednesday his 
first visit since 1979 his visa requests repeatedly were turned 
down until his most recent application 
in cape town foreign minister pik botha indicated it was not 
the most opportune time for jackson to visit because of rapid 
political changes in the country 
right now we are in the midst of important decisions and its 
not easy to deal with all of the fanfare of some of our american 
friends botha said at a briefing but he said jackson was 
welcome 
jackson arrived in zambia on tuesday after visiting prime 
minister margaret thatcher in britain and was to hold talks with 
president kenneth kaunda who is also chairman of the sixnation 
african frontline bloc neighboring south africa 
the civil rights leader has said he hopes to meet de klerk and 
jailed anc leader nelson mandela on his current trip he was 
invited to south africa by freed anc leader walter sisulu and the 
south african council of churches 
botha complained that jackson a former candidate for the 
democratic presidential nomination alternates his statements on 
sanctions depending on his audience 
he said jackson has told south african officials he favors an 
end to punitive sanctions against the country to pressure for an 
end to apartheid but then makes public speeches appealing for new 
sanctions 
the time has come when jesse and i must talk straight to each 
other botha said 
he added that jacksons visit will have nothing to do with 
mandelas release because the decision already has been made 
he can enjoy the aftermath but not claim any credit botha 
said

chestdeep water as the queens spectacular flotilla neared the 
shore the queen arrived by navy launch escorted by 22 giant war 
canoes some with up to 200 crewmen

ceremonial treaty site a woman threw a black tshirt at her as she 
drove by police spokesman tony bouchier said there were five 
arrests for minor offenses including an unidentified maori woman 
who threw the shirt 
the queen looked startled as the tshirt landed in her car

the queens address in which she said i am a descendant of one 
party of the treaty of waitangi and many here today are the 
descendants of the original maori signatories 
in an unusually frank admission she admitted the treaty had its 
weaknesses and that it had not always been followed 
many maori were disappointed but it is encouraging to know 
progress has been made in putting things right she said

lessons of the last 150 years and to admit that the treaty has been 
imperfectly observed she said

of whom are demanding land forests and fishing grounds be returned 
to maori people under terms of the 1840 treaty

a republican congressman is beginning a new 
attack on the national endowment for the arts promising weekly 
examples showing the federal agency uses tax dollars to subsidize 
pornography 
in his first dear colleague letter to fellow house members 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif accused the arts endowment of 
underwriting a series of sexually explicit performances by porn 
video star annie sprinkle at the kitchen a private performing arts 
center in lower manhattan 
at one point in her act he wrote she commented that usually 
i get paid a lot of money for this but tonight its government 
funded 
endowment chairman john e frohnmayer denied that was the case 
frohnmayer said in a telephone interview tuesday that the 
endowment gave a 60000 grant to the kitchen last year solely for 
operating expenses but did not award any grant for miss sprinkles 
12performance show 
i want to make it very clear that we do not fund anything that 
is obscene and in fact my view is that art and obscenity are 
mutually exclusive terms he said i think those who oppose 
obscenity and i count myself among them might more fruitfully 
look elsewhere 
he added i dont intend to rise to the bait any time someone 
comes up with a new horror story 
barbara tsumagari executive director of the kitchen said in 
new york that miss sprinkles show was not financed with federal 
funds 
ms tsumagari said the new york state council on the arts gave a 
25000 grant to the kitchen to underwrite part of its season of 54 
performances but specifically excluded miss sprinkles show that 
was confirmed by council spokesman tim mulligan 
frohnmayer said the nea gave the new york arts council a 
500000 grant last year for staff salaries and other 
administrative expenses 
under a headline that read the national endowment for the 
arts is at it again rohrabacher charged that annie sprinkles 
titillating masterpiece received your constituents tax dollars 
he urged his colleagues to remind frohnmayer that he is 
dealing with taxpayer funds and is accountable for how they are 
spent just like every other head of every other federal agency 
rohrabacher added if the nea cant hold itself responsible to 
the us taxpayer its our job to make them responsible 
the congressmans press secretary david eisner said his boss 
plans to publicize similar examples every week or so highlighting 
what he called the endowments use of tax dollars for triplex 
hardcore pornographic stuff 
eisner said the neas supporters dismiss such cases as 
isolated incidents but we are starting a campaign to really 
work hard to show thats not the case this is a systemic problem 
frohnmayer a former portland ore lawyer took command of the 
nea last september amid a political controversy over a touring 
exhibition including sexually explicit pictures by photographer 
robert mapplethorpe that was partially financed by the endowment 
that controversy prompted congress in approving a 171 million 
budget for the nea last october to ban federal financial support 
for obscene art deemed to be lacking in literary artistic 
political or scientific value 
the house defeated a rohrabacher proposal to abolish the 
endowment an independent federal agency that underwrites a wide 
variety of artists and arts institutions with taxpaid matching 
grants 
rohrabachers new campaign could prove politically embarrassing 
for the nea at a time when the house and senate are planning 
hearings on legislation that would authorize extending the life of 
the endowment 
sen jesse helms rnc the endowments most vocal senate 
critic peppered nea officials last november and december with 
demands for details of the endowments history of support for eight 
arts groups and nine artists 
helms letters indicated he was concerned about the sexual 
content of their work arts supporters say helms is conducting a 
campaign of intimidation against nea grant recipients who 
specialize in experimental and controversial arts projects 
frohnmayer asked about the helms letters said i deem all 
congressional inquiries to be legitimate and i respond to them and 
thats what i intend to do in this case

the library at the national press club will 
continue to bear the name of journalist hl mencken despite what 
the clubs secretary described as despicable remarks about jews 
and blacks in menckens recently published diaries 
the clubs board of governors voted 74 monday to retain 
menckens name after receiving appeals from notables including 
historian arthur m schlesinger jr who urged the club not to 
rename its library in an excess of selfrighteousness 
mick rood a reporter for the states news service and the clubs 
secretary argued for removing menckens name saying his remarks 
about jews and blacks were despicable 
in all his years of running down say the methodists the 
context was ideological a hardedged social commentary rood 
said whenever he excoriated the philistines he presented a body 
of convincing evidence the only evidence behind his antisemitic 
remarks was venom 
this club neednt honor this man in this way rood said 
we can admire but we neednt revere 
schlesinger in a letter to the club said mencken had his 
faults like all the rest of us and he made his mistakes some of 
them awful but he was a great newspaperman and basically a 
liberating influence on american society i hope the national 
press club will not turn its back on him in an excess of 
selfrighteousness 
economist john kenneth galbraith and journalist lawrence e 
spivak also wrote to the board urging that the mencken name be 
retained 
his comments on jews and blacks are no worse than those one 
could have heard around harvard or any other major university in 
those days and without evident shock galbraith said you are 
not i trust expelling ivy league graduates of that period to the 
extent that they survive 
spivak who succeeded mencken as editor of the american mercury 
magazine and later moderated meet the press on nbc radio and 
television wrote mencken was a great journalist but like many 
of us was stupid about a lot of things actually his attitude 
toward jews was like that of many selfsatisfied jews that he knew 
because they were jewish they felt they could say whatever they 
wanted about other jews without being considered antisemitic 
morton c paulson associate editor of changing times magazine 
told his fellow board members 
i am convinced that he was far from being a racist a bigot or 
sympathetic to the third reich 
the last column he wrote for the baltimore evening sun before 
he suffered a disabling stroke was a withering attack on the city 
for segregating a public park 
in any event he added nothing will change the fact that 
his contributions to journalism were extraordinary and he was one 
of the greatest literary scholars of all times 
the library was named the hl mencken library and reference 
center when it opened in 1984 in naming it the board noted that 
mencken once said he could be the the second best expert on any 
subject if he had a firstclass library behind him 
mencken who died in 1956 was a longtime columnist for the 
evening sun in baltimore as well as the author of a highly praised 
work on the american language and a classic memoir 
his recently published diaries contain such phrases as a brisk 
clever jew and a highly dubious jew and he says of 
colored women that they are all essentially childlike and 
even hard experience does not teach them anything 
the motion defeated by the board would have removed menckens 
name and left the renaming of the library to future action 
those voting against the motion and thus to keep the mencken 
name were kathryn kahler of newhouse news service board 
chairwoman john peterson the detroit news vice president of the 
club gil klein media general vice chairman of the board tom 
squitieri usa today club treasurer ed prina retired washington 
bureau chief for copley newspapers financial secretary greg 
spears knightridder newspapers and rick thomas roll call report 
syndicate 
board members voting for the motion and thus to remove the 
name were frances hardin cable news network dennis melamed 
freelance journalist clayton boyce of knight ridder and rood

some of nations restaurateurs are scaling back 
their prices to lure the cautious customers of the 90s who have 
become as concerned about their wallets as they are about their 
waistlines 
instead of breast of duck were serving cheddarstuffed 
meatloaf said brad grill manager of the upscale harvest 
restaurant in nearby cambridge 
the days of the 27 freerange chicken are over richard 
krause chef and restaurant owner in new york city no one wants 
to pay that its too much money no matter how good it is 
at krauses new restaurant the rose cafe entrees range from 
1295 to 1795 he charged 17 to 24 for entrees at his recently 
closed melrose 
with the shrinking discretionary dollar people are choosing 
places more intelligently where theres a better value krause 
said in a phone interview tuesday the changes also reflect a 
betterinformed customer he said 
who wants to eat baby purple whatever beans at 35 a pound in 
the middle of winter when there are great string beans locally 
he said 
peter romeo special projects editor at nations restaurant 
news a trade publication said the restaurant industry is 
definitely seeing a slowdown 
its certainly slower than the heyday of the early 80s 
romeo said 
people have leaner budgets and baby boomers who are starting 
their own families are eating out less he said from new york city 
coupled with new restaurants entering the scene every day these 
developments mean everyone has to settle for a smaller piece of 
the pie 
people are battening down the hatches a little bit they want 
to go out two or three times a week rather than blow the whole wad 
on a fancy meal romeo said 
changes in tastes were also responsible for the downturn he 
said 
the infatuation with cutting edge cuisine has kind of ended 
theres not so many flower blossoms on the plate just familiar 
foods romeo said 
statistics confirm a slowing of growth in the restaurant 
business nationwide according to anne papa of the national 
restaurant association in washington dc which tracks the 
industry 
the number of orders placed in upscale restaurants nationwide 
increased 54 percent from 1982 to 1983 by 1988 there was an 
annual decrease of 14 percent and then it went back up slightly 
in 1989 by 05 percent papa said 
cambridges harvest which brings in about 3 million a year is 
taking steps to relieve the financial pinch including cooking with 
locally grown spices and fruits rather than those flown in from 
hawaii and australia 
prices for entrees have dropped from an average of 20 to 
1617 and they are offering more 1825 wines than 2535 
were trying to be more accessible to the person who wants to 
eat here more frequently rather than once a month said grill 
renato burkhardt the general manager at lockeober a famous 
boston restaurant said cutting prices is risky 
shaving prices can have a couple of reactions either people 
say the establishment is panicking or they say it shouldnt have 
had those prices anyway burkhardt said 
lockeober which grosses about 6 million a year instead 
broadened its menu to include cheaper alternatives called winter 
fare burkhardt said 
the winter fare includes venison and duck from the restaurants 
farm and prices for entrees range from 18 to 20 as compared to 
the regular menu offerings of seafood and continental cuisine 
priced at 22 to 24 
until the storm is weathered you have to do that to stay 
alive or let me put it this way to get the least rainedon

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter sent 
congress new farm proposals on tuesday that he said maintain the 
federalbenefit principles of the expiring 1985 law but give 
farmers more flexibility 
he did not however offer any advice for financing the 
proposals saying well have to legislate in cooperation with 
congress 
we dont intend to make specific recommendations on how to 
meet budget requirements he said 
the budget proposals president bush released last week call for 
a cut in fiscal 1991 commodity spending of 15 billion 
when asked specifically about those cuts yeutter said this 
document doesnt deal with budget it deals with policy 
he said the proposals generally are modifications to the 1985 
farm act designed to provide the flexibility to adjust to changes 
in the international marketplace maintain the successful course 
set in the 1985 legislation and balance the need for an 
abundant safe and affordable food supply with conservation and 
improvement of our environment 
to give farmers the planting flexibility yeutter said they 
consider the most important part of any new legislation he has 
proposed a normal crop acreage concept 
this would allow farmers to plant crops based on market demand 
without loss of farm program benefits 
it would define crops that could be substituted for program 
crops authorize cropspecific acreage reduction programs and 
provide authority to plant on idled acres in exchange for giving up 
specified deficiency payments 
the administration proposals follow the introduction monday by 
the house agriculture committee of its 1990 farm bill 
after a glance at yeutters recommendations the house 
agriculture committee chairman rep kika de la garza dtexas 
said he thought congress would come up with legislation acceptable 
to the white house without much trouble 
the senate agriculture committee chairman sen patrick leahy 
responded negatively to yeutters proposal 
unfortunately the heart of the farm bill is not there said 
leahy a vermont democrat the administration fails to tell 
farmers what it thinks target prices should be 
american farmers dont know what their income will be and 
congress does not know how much the administration will be willing 
to spend on farm programs 
a spokeswoman for the national farmers union cheryl cook said 
her biggest criticism of the proposal was the lack of any 
information whatsover on price levels relating to commodity 
supports and targets 
for our money the whole purpose of the pricesupport program 
is income protection for farmers and that seems to be the one area 
that the administration has chosen not to look at at all 
questioned about farm income at a news conference yeutter said 
i see no reason why we should not be able to provide net farm 
income that would give a very satisfactory standard of living to 
farmers even though the federal contribution will decline 
he also said that the effect of his proposals on consumer prices 
would be nominal 
the administrations recommendation that crop insurance be 
replaced with a new crop disaster resistance program has already 
been floated in congress and is likely to produce lively debate 
during discussion of the farm bill 
the federal crop insurance corp which provides subsidized 
allrisk coverage to farmers has been losing money for many years 
with many farmers spurning the insurance and relying on congress to 
bail them out when an emergency arises 
we have not found a way to make crop insurance work within 
realistic budget targets said the secretary 
he said his proposal would provide payments for individual 
losses whenever countywide harvested yields fall below 65 percent 
of normal on a cropbycrop basis 
he envisions a standing law designed along the lines of the ad 
hoc disaster legislation passed in 1988 and 1989 to provide farmers 
drought relief his proposal would eliminate the need for such ad 
hoc bills he said 
other highlights in yeutters recommendations include 
a grain reserve and stocks policy based on annual contracts 
that give the farmer more say in deciding when stocks should be 
released into the marketplace 
changing the trigger for acreagereduction programs to be more 
consistent with market and farmer needs 
extending the loan rate formula for wheat and feedgrains to 
upland cotton extra longstaple cotton and rice the 1985 loan rate 
formula for soybeans also would be extended 
incentives to use perennial cover crops on setaside acreage as 
a means to naturally improve soil fertility 
methods for cutting down fraud in the use of food stamps and 
grants to organizations that test innovative ways to get food 
stamps to the homeless 
tightening of the farmers home administration programs so 
borrowers cant so easily abuse its loan policy 
requiring all exported corn to be tested for aflatoxin

an important part of the bush administrations 
farm bill proposals announced tuesday involves a flexibility 
plan to ease some of the governments restraints on crop plantings 
one of the complaints of farmers is that agriculture department 
rules to control production are too severe and often penalize them 
for not following program regulations straight down the line 
wheat farmers must abide by rules in the wheat program feed 
grain producers must following feed grain regulations and so on 
if there is deviation the acreage base or history of a crop may be 
reduced thereby meaning reduced usda payments and other benefits 
current law passed in 1985 expires at the end of the 1990 crop 
season it generally denies program benefits if farmers harvest 
crops other than the program crop for which they have a base 
acreage 
a change in the strict rules is being sought by the 
administration as well as by many farm groups and members of 
congress 
the american farm bureau federation favors acreage flexibility 
with a couple of stipulations of its own and the national farmers 
union which is often at odds with the administration on farm 
policy also likes the idea but wants to study the fine print on 
the administrations plan 
meanwhile agriculture secretary clayton yeutter explained the 
administrations version of flexibility at a news conference and 
its not exactly a new idea he said heres how it might work 
each farm is assigned a normal crop acreage or nca which is 
the total acreage bases of program crops such as wheat feed 
grains upland and extralong staple cotton plus a farms 
historical plantings of oilseeds soybeans sunflowers and 
rapeseed including canola 
as it does now the usda each year determines whether to apply 
individual crop acreagereduction programs called arps if 
necessary to each crops base acreage if so a percentage of the 
farms base with the exception of oilseed acres must be idled 
as an acreage conservation reserve or acr 
to qualify for price supports and other program benefits the 
farmer must comply with the arp requirement for that crop in 
addition the sum of all ncacrop plantings plus land idled under 
the acreage reduction programs cannot exceed the nca for the 
individual farm 
in return the farmer is allowed some flexibility without losing 
benefits or suffering penalties on the farms acreage base 
were proposing that we would establish arps acreage 
reduction programs on a cropbycrop basis just as we do now 
yeutter said in other words therell be a wheat arp and a corn 
or a feed grains arp and a rice arp whatever it may be 
basically on the rest of the acreage the farmer will be able 
to grow any of the socalled program crops plus any of the oilseed 
crops he said 
its really what i would call a modified nca program as 
the nca existed back in the 70s or thereabouts yeutter said 
in an example a 300acre farm included a 100acre wheat base a 
100acre corn base and 100 acres of soybeans the mythical wheat 
program included a 5 percent arp and the corn program a 10 percent 
arp 
that means the farmer has to pull out 5 acres of land for his 
wheat arp 10 acres for his corn arp and then under present law 
that means hell plant 95 acres of wheat and hell plant 90 acres 
of corn yeutter said and then on the other 100 acres hell 
grow soybeans or whatever 
shifting to the simplest example of flexibility as proposed 
in the administration plan yeutter said the arps would be the same 
as they are now five acres of wheat and 10 acres of corn 
but on the remaining 285 acres yeutter said the farmer would 
be allowed to grow wheat corn any of the oilseeds rice cotton 
or whatever 
and he can plant that in any proportions he wishes yeutter 
said if he wants to plant it all to wheat he can plant it all 
to wheat if he wants to plant it all to corn he can plant it all 
to corn 
yeutter described several variations of the plan in which the 
300acre farmer could plant certain crops on his setaside acres 
provided his acres eligible for payments are reduced accordingly 
oilseeds and experimental crops such as kenaf used for newsprint 
are among the options under the flexibility plan he said

the founding priest of covenant house was 
directed by his order to take leave of his duties tuesday while it 
investigates the allegations of sexual misconduct against him 
earlier in the day the rev bruce ritter issued a statement 
saying he had elected to take several weeks off from running the 
shelter program for runaways so he could rest and recuperate from 
stress 
but ritters order of roman catholic priests the franciscans 
said it had instructed him to relinquish his duties until its 
investigation was done a spokesman the rev juniper connelly 
said he had no idea how long that may be 
the new york times on tuesday reported the franciscan 
authorities investigation of charges by a former covenant house 
client that the 62yearold ritter had a sexual relationship with 
him in 1973 when he was 14 
ritter a prominent campaigner against the sexual exploitation 
of youth characterized such charges now made by three men as 
garbage telling the times he never never had sexual 
relations with any youth in covenant house 
in his statement he said i am profoundly saddened by the 
allegations against me and the need to deny them constantly i have 
no way of proving my innocence my accusers cannot establish my 
guilt 
i devoutly hope the inquiries currently under way will bring 
an end to this incredibly painful chapter in my life 
besides the franciscan investigation the manhattan district 
attorneys office is investigating covenant houses use of funds 
and its provision of false identification to at least one youth 
moreover covenant house said monday that it had provided a 
former male prostitute with the identity of a 10yearold boy who 
died of leukemia in 1980 it acted without the knowledge of the 
boys parents saying it sought to protect the exprostitute from 
enemies 
the former prostitute kevin kite 26 is one of those making 
charges against ritter in december the new york post reported 
kites allegations that he had an eightmonth sexual relationship 
with ritter beginning a year ago he said ritter gave him money 
housing and gifts in exchange for sex 
ritter has denied kites charges and kites father stepped 
forward to describe his son as a chronic liar 
the accusation struck at a time of great success for covenant 
house which has grown to become the nations largest shelter 
program for runaway youths since he founded it in 1968 
it runs 17 shelters with more than 2000 beds in the united 
states canada and latin america and planned a broad expansion 
this year 
but donations after tripling in four years have declined since 
kites charges were made public covenant house took in 3 million 
less than its expected 15 million in december and expansion 
plans are on hold 
at a dec 14 news conference ritter warned that copycats 
might make charges similar to kites but the newly public 
accusations from two more former covenant house clients appear to 
predate the december disclosure 
on jan 24 the village voice reported that john melican now of 
seattle charged in an unpublished interview in 1986 that he had a 
13year sexual relationship with ritter melican repeated the 
charges to the times saying the relationship began when he was 13 
the times reported that the third man darryl bassile 31 now 
of ithaca charged that he had sexual relations with ritter in 1973 
after learning of kites charges bassile said he made his own 
complaint to the franciscan friary in union city nj and 
contacted the times when he had not heard back from the friary 
the franciscan minister provincial the rev conall mchugh sits 
on the board of covenant house 
mchugh said the order tried unsuccessfully to reach bassile 
before succeeding on jan 24 now he said franciscan leaders 
have directed father bruce to begin a period of rest and 
recuperation without responsibility for covenant house until this 
inquiry is completed

president bush proclaiming the united states 
in excellent economic health sent his first economic report to 
congress on tuesday he promised to restrain government spending 
and push for tax cuts to foster even more prosperity 
bush said he would continue his fight to get congress to reduce 
the capital gains tax and pledged anew to fight protectionist trade 
barriers 
his message did not dwell on what many see as the biggest 
failures of the reagan years the record federal budget deficits 
and the huge trade imbalances that transformed america from the 
largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country 
bush did pledge to deal with inherited problems but his 
formula for dealing with the budget deficit tracked reagans 
approach promising to oppose new taxes while relying on economic 
growth and restraints in government spending to erase the deficit 
by 1993 
many private economists say the administrations economic 
outlook for the next five years is too optimistic 
the administration foresees no recession with the gross national 
product expanding at annual rates of 3 percent or higher from 1991 
through 1995 economic expansions do not die of old age a 
recession is not likely in the near term the economic report 
states 
while stressing traditional republican freemarket themes the 
419page annual economic report of the president avoided some 
of the more doctrinaire positions on monetary policy and 
supplyside economics sounded during the reagan years 
instead bush used the message the first presented by his 
administration to lay out generally mainstream economic goals such 
as the need for growthoriented policies and renewed efforts to 
bring the federal deficit under control 
on taxes bush said one of my highest legislative priorities 
this year is to reduce the captial gains tax rate this tax reform 
would promote risktaking and entrepreneurship by lowering the cost 
of capital a capital gains tax cut would stimulate saving and 
investment throughout the economy 
he also said that the primary economic goal of my 
administration is to achieve the highest possible rate of 
sustainable economic growth bush said in the report growth is 
the key to raising living standards to leaving a legacy of 
prosperity for our children to uplifting those most in need and to 
maintaining americas leadership in the world 
addressing the differences between bush and reagan on economic 
issues michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of 
economic advisers suggested that the administration was more 
willing to use government to address problems in such fields as 
boosting spending for research fighting illegal drugs and 
expanding head start 
i think that president reagan believed that not only was 
government the problem but that it was rare indeed that government 
could be a positive force in solving the problem boskin said at 
a briefing for reporters bush does believe in some areas the 
federal government has an important role to play 
in the economic report bush reviewed the period since the end 
of the 198182 recession a peacetime record of seven years of 
expansion in that time more than 20 million jobs have been 
created driving the unemployment rate down to a level not seen 
since the early 1970s 
our excellent economic health will allow us to build on the 
successes of the 1980s as we prepare for the next century bush 
said 
bush declared his top trade priority was successful completion 
of the current 96nation round of trade talks the president is 
seeking to eliminate farm subsidies and expand trading 
opportunities in banking insurance and other service industries in 
which american firms excel 
we cannot remain competitive by avoiding competition my 
administration will therefore continue to resist calls for 
protection and managed trade he said 
bush also rejected proposals for the federal government to 
promote an industrial policy of picking winners and losers 
among emerging technologies declaring that secondguessing the 
market is the way to raise government spending and taxes not 
living standards 
while sometimes critical of the federal reserve boards interest 
rate policies in his first year in office the president praised 
the central bank for a high degree of policy credibility 
in a departure from the monetarist leanings of the reagan 
administration bushs economic outlook warned against a reliance 
on rigid monetary targeting the process promoted by certain 
economists in which the central bank focuses solely on controlling 
the growth of the nations money supply as the way to keep 
inflation at bay 
on other topics the economic report 
devoted an entire chapter to environmental regulation 
including the presidents proposed amendments to the clean air act 
which environmental critics contend do not go far enough to 
safeguard the environment a healthy environment and a sound 
economy can be compatible if and only if environmental 
regulation is welldesigned the report states 
deplored americans low savings rates offering as remedies a 
cut in the tax on capital gains profits earned on the sale of 
assets and proposals to expand the use of individual retirement 
accounts to firsttime home buyers and to create a new family 
savings account that would allow married couples to invest up to 
5000 taxfree as long as the money was held for seven years 
the administrations taxcut proposals came under heavy fire at 
a congressional hearing 
rep dan rostenkowski dill and chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said that such tax breaks have done little to 
boost saving 
tinkering with the tax code is the worst thing we could do 
he said this is just gimmickry that we are going to suffer for 
in the long run 
other democrats on the committee assailed bushs proposed cut in 
taxes on capital gains as a giveaway to the rich but treasury 
secretary nicholas brady responded by saying it may be viewed as 
unfortunate that most of the benefit of cutting taxes on capital 
gains would go to those with incomes over 200000 a year it is 
those people who have the most to invest brady noted

savings and loan depositors withdrew 49 
billion in november as the thrift industry continued to shrink in 
response to tougher financial standards enacted last summer the 
government said tuesday 
it was the lowest level of withdrawals in four months but was 
still the 17th outflow in 18 months and brought total deposits at 
the nations 2889 sampls down to 947 billion the office of thrift 
supervision said 
withdrawals in the first 11 months of 1989 totaled 649 
billion outflows which hit a record of 108 billion in january 
1989 were 64 billion in october 
the withdrawals early in the year were attributed to eroding 
depositor confidence and rising interest rates offered by 
investment alternatives such as money market mutual funds 
economists say outflows in the last half of the year are part of 
a deliberate strategy by sampls to comply with bailout legislation 
enacted aug 9 
most of the shrinkage was likely due to thrifts continuing 
strategy to reduce assets to comply with new capital 
requirements said economist james freund of the thrift office 
the new standard effective dec 7 requires sampl owners to put 
more of their own money behind their institutions 
weak thrift associations that have trouble raising capital are 
finding they must reduce their portfolios of loans and other 
investments as they sell assets they need fewer deposits 
the industrys assets declined by 88 billion in november after 
a 63 billion drop in october they totaled 128 trillion 
compared with 133 trillion a year earlier 
the 275 failed thrifts under government control at the end of 
november like the rest of the industry experienced shrinkage 
governmentcontrolled thrifts lost 22 billion in deposits and 
23 billion in assets privately controlled thrifts shed 27 
billion in deposits and 65 billion in assets 
weakness in housing and construction was reflected in a decline 
in mortgages originated by thrifts to 145 billion compared with 
158 billion a month earlier and 183 billion a year ago

governments in west germany the netherlands 
and japan are unwilling to control the export of chemicals used to 
manufacture drugs a bush administration drug official said tuesday 
it does not seem likely that european chemical legislation as 
contemplated will have a significant impact on the diversion and 
trafficking of chemicals particularly those destined for the 
illicit production of cocaine said gene r haislip deputy 
assistant administrator of the us drug enforcement administration 
haislip testifying before the subcommittee on foreign commerce 
of the senate commerce committee said great quantities of 
chemicals are shipped through the dutch port of rotterdam 
whereas in the past most of these shipments have come from the 
united states i think the shift is on and in the future were 
going to see that europe and to some lesser extent brazil and 
other countries will become the predominant suppliers with the 
netherlands and the federal republic of germany being the two 
principal exporting countries he said 
he cited a case to show that several countries can be involved 
a broker in london ordered the materials from a supplier in 
the netherlands and the materials were shipped from rotterdam to 
colombia he said 
the customer was a fiction the material acetone was 
falsified on the manifest and shipping papers and the labels on the 
containers themselves were spraypainted over so that the 
merchandise could not be identified the europeans would like 
to pretend that voluntary efforts will solve their problems and 
its quite clear that that is the thinnest kind of pretense 
in an interview after his testimony haislip said the west 
german and dutch governments are reluctant to interfere with what 
they see as legitimate business 
he said there is also a problem in trying to halt shipments of 
chemicals for the manufacture of heroin in burma and thailand 
especially acetic anhydride from india and japan he reported that 
he had some discussions with indian authorities but that it was 
harder to interest the japanese 
theyre not accustomed to interfering with commerce he said 
at the hearing sens harry reid and richard bryan both nevada 
democrats accused us chemical companies of selling chemicals 
that help make drugs in colombia 
the evidence is inescapable that some american chemical 
manufacturers and distributors have contributed to americas 100 
billion cocaine habit said bryan the record shows that 52 out 
of 288 requests for regular customer status almost one in five 
were rejected by the drug enforcement administration 
reid focused on a chemical called methyl ethyl ketone or mek 
which can be used to refine cocaine 
why is exxon permitted to sell mek to companies associated 
with the drug cartel in colombia he asked 
john rutledge latin american manager for exxon chemical 
company testified that he was confident that its shipments of mek 
were not being diverted from their legitimate use to remove wax 
from lubricating oil 
all of our sales of chemicals covered by the law are cleared 
with the drug enforcement administration prior to each individual 
shipment he said

support to president bushs proposal for further deep cuts in 
american and soviet troops in europe an alliance official said 
tuesday

thursday at eastwest negotiations in vienna on reducing 
conventional forces in europe

additional proposals possibly concerning combat aircraft and 
helicopters at the vienna talks he did not give details

sovietled warsaw pact are trying to complete an agreement this 
year for dramatic reductions in personnel tanks artillery 
armored troop carriers combat aircraft and helicopters from the 
atlantic ocean to the ural mountains

by an accord and a verification system for ensuring compliance 
in his state of the union message last week bush proposed a 
ceiling of 195000 each from the united states and the soviet union 
in central europe the united states would have 30000 more in 
britain and southern europe

fewer men but more women will die this year 
from lung cancer and cigarette advertising is partly to blame 
the american cancer society said tuesday 
in its annual cancer facts and figures the society predicts 
92000 men will die this year of lung cancer down from 93000 last 
year and the first decline since the projections began in 1953 
thats because men have been quitting smoking over the last two 
decades first younger men and now all age groups said cancer 
society spokeswoman joann schellenbach that is translating into 
fewer cases of lung cancer 
about 50000 women will die of lung cancer up from 49000 last 
year the organization said 
schellenbach said women also are starting to give up smoking 
but their health trend hasnt caught up to mens yet because men 
started smoking at the turn of the century and women started 
smoking in the 1930s 
in addition she said while many older women are trying to 
quit many younger ones dont because theyre afraid of gaining 
weight 
theres a tremendous campaign not only directed at women but 
playing on the concern about weight said schellenbach noting a 
variety of cigarettes with slim in their brand name and new 
cigarettes touted as having a pleasant socially acceptable aroma 
the cancer society is planning its own campaign to counter the 
advertising 
lung cancer will account for 1420000 of the 510000 predicted 
cancer deaths this year in addition to smoking risk factors 
include exposure to radon radiation asbestos arsenic and some 
chemicals 
the other 1990 predictions included 
600000 new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer the majority of 
them curable and another 27600 of melanoma the most serious skin 
cancer there will be 6300 deaths from melanoma and 2500 from 
other skin cancers 
150000 new breast cancer cases up from 142000 last year 
partly due to the aging population the fiveyear survival rate for 
localized breast cancer has risen from 78 percent in the 1940s to 
90 percent today

representatives of city officials doctors 
lawyers educators and religious groups joined gun control activist 
sarah brady tuesday in urging prompt congressional action on a bill 
to ban 14 specific semiautomatic assault weapons 
this is the first time these fine groups have gathered 
together to speak out for sensible gun laws mrs brady wife of 
former presidential press secretary james brady said at a news 
conference but im angry that we have to be here at all 
mrs bradys husband was severely wounded during an 
assassination attempt on president reagan in 1981 
the bill supported by mrs brady would ban the import 
manufacture sale and possession of the 14 weapons it was approved 
last year by the senate judiciary committee and is awaiting action 
by the full senate she called on senate leaders to call it up to 
the floor this week and let the american public know where their 
senators stand 
gun owner support groups have opposed the legislation on the 
grounds that semiautomatic weapons one pull of the trigger fires 
one round are essentially the same as many hunting rifles and 
would force many sportsmen to give up their weapons 
rabbi lynne landsberg assistant director of the religious 
action center of reform judaism said at the news conference we 
cannot begin to curb crime and the epidemic of random violence 
which plagues our cities while we continue to legitimize the 
wholesale arming of ordinary citizens including the mentally 
defective and the street gangs 
warren eisenberg director of the international council of bnai 
brith said his organization does not believe the bill would 
interfere with the legitimate activities of sportsmen 
in an age when hate criminals and narcoterrorists use assault 
weapons to commit their crimes it is ridiculous to try to defend 
certain categories of domestic and imported weapons as sporting 
equipment eisenberg said 
the american federation of teachers distributed a statement 
supporting the bill as a positive first step and saying 
because of the access people have to semiautomatic assault 
weapons we have to add violent crime to the list of problems 
facing our children we should be doing everything in our power to 
insure that american students are protected from violence 
dr john seward member and past chairman of the american 
medical association council on legislation urged approval of the 
legislation saying as a physician and a county coroner in 
northwestern illinois i have seen firsthand the devastating 
wounds inflicted by assault weapons fired during violent crimes 
robert z alpern director of the washington office of the 
unitarian universalist association said passage of the bill 
would be a small step toward limiting the supply of 
semiautomatic weapons that have taken an unconscionable toll of 
human lives and terrorized our nation 
stanley chauvin president of the american bar association 
urged action on the bill to prevent a permanent militarylike 
escalation of drug crime in our nation 
jim moran mayor alexandria va and chairman of the human 
development policy committee of the national league of cities said 
he spoke for the bill on the basis of nlc policy which i also 
happen to fervently and wholeheartedly endorse as a mayor as a 
citizen of my community and as a worried parent as well 
the 14 weapons are the mac10 and mac11 steyr aug colt ar15

attorneys for a man charged in the 
disappearance of a multimillionaires wife rested their case 
tuesday without putting their client on the stand after saying a 
potential witness wouldnt tell them his location 
us district judge tom lee told jurors they would hear closing 
arguments wednesday in the kidnapping conspiracy trial of 
65yearold newton alfred winn 
winn prosecutors and defense attorneys spent much of tuesday 
morning in a closed session in chambers with the judge after winn 
and his attorneys disagreed about whether winn should testify 
winn a st petersburg fla attorney is charged with plotting 
the july 26 1988 kidnapping of annie laurie hearin in jackson 
and with extortion and perjury mrs hearin the wife of jackson 
multimillionaire robert hearin is still missing 
the defense presented few witnesses 
sheriffs deputy granville ratcliff of cheatham county tenn 
testified he had talked to marilyn taylor then marilyn phillips a 
key prosecution witness and winns former lover 
ratcliff said he talked to her about where to get an 
unregistered or stolen license tag he said he was reasonably 
certain the discussion took place in late spring 1988 
taylors testimony given this past week implicated winn in the 
kidnapping of mrs hearin 
don ward a former employee of winns testified as a 
prosecution rebuttal witness that he didnt write a postcard taylor 
testified she received from winn in 1986 the card was signed 
alice johnson a name taylor said she later learned winn 
sometimes used 
ward said that while working as a private investigator he 
sometimes used the name al johnson 
during the trial monday defense attorneys asked the government 
to help them locate and subpoena taylors exhusband mark 
phillips who taylor testified was a mob hit man 
the government informs me it has found mark phillips and is 
trying to get him to agree to come in defense attorney ed marger 
said tuesday before resting the case 
weve talked to him but he wont tell us where he is sxaid 
defense attorney john colette 
fbi agent patrick mcglenon testified monday that the fbi found 
nothing indicating phillips was a hit man was linked to the mafia 
or had any involvement in the kidnapping 
during crossexamination of taylor marger accused her phillips 
and ward of being the masterminds behind the kidnapping 
on monday prosecutor james tucker named ward who was granted 
immunity from prosecution as the person the government thinks 
conspired with winn to kidnap mrs hearin 
tucker was arguing against a defense request that the conspiracy 
to kidnap charge against winn be dismissed the defense had argued 
that the government could not pursue a conspiracy case with only 
one conspirator the judge denied the request no one besides winn 
has been charged 
ward testified last week that winn sent him to mississippi four 
times between 1986 and 1988 to investigate hearin and his 
businesses and photograph the couples home 
hearin is former chief executive officer of school pictures 
inc in which winn once held a franchise in florida legal 
disputes with the company caused winn to lose real and personal 
property in 1988 when he went into bankruptcy 
while it is true mr ward is not willing to admit at this 
particular time that mrs hearin was to be kidnapped he knew mr 
winns situation tucker said 
ward has testified that at winns request he lied to a federal 
grand jury investigating the kidnapping corroborating winns story 
that he was with a prostitute in st petersburg the day of the 
kidnapping

the president of the arab league will lead 
a delegation to the soviet union to protest the flow of soviet 
jewish emigration to israel league sources said tuesday 
also tuesday jordans king hussein called for an urgent arab 
summit to forge a unified stand against the influx 
israel expects between 300000 and 500000 soviet jews to arrive 
in the next three years and prime minister yitzhak shamir has 
indicated israel might need the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
to settle all the arrivals 
the palestinians aim to establish an independent state in those 
territories which were captured by israel during the 1967 middle 
east war 
the delegation of arab diplomats also will visit the united 
states france britain and china in their roles as permanent 
members of the un security council the league sources said 
arab league president chedli klibi and plo chief yasser arafat 
chaired a threehour closeddoor meeting of ministers from algeria 
iraq jordan saudi arabia syria and tunisia the ministers form 
the standing committee on the palestinian uprising 
the gathering marked the first time the committee formed to 
coordinate arab strategy toward the uprising or intefadeh in 
the occupied terrories has met in more than a year 
hussein meanwhile called on arab leaders to open a dialogue 
with the soviet union and new governments in east europe because he 
said israel was attempting to exploit the downfall of communist 
regimes there in its favor 
he told the daily alwatan that the soviet jewish influx will 
add to the israeli strength already realized as a result of support 
it receives from the jewish and world zionist movement the 
influence of the extremist israeli right on the american decision 
makers at least in the legislative branch and the proisrael 
attitudes of the united states 
where will these thousands settle at the expense of whom 
he asked 
hussein said that in talking to moscow we arabs cannot say 
to it that it should not allow its people to exercise their rights 
but at the same time we should warn against the dangers besetting 
the rights of palestinians and the arabs on their soil 
also tuesday 85 members of the palestine national council the 
palestinian parliamentinexile signed a petition to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev urging him to halt the emigration 
of soviet jews to israel 
in the name of human rights we call on you to quickly 
intervene to stop soviet jewish exodus which is considered 
another jewish invasion of our homeland the petition said

pap smear screening to detect cervical cancer 
combined with appropriate treatment could save the lives of many 
elderly women according to a study tuesday by the office of 
technology assessment 
medicare the federal health care program for the elderly will 
begin paying for pap tests in july 1990 and ota said the screening 
will be most costeffective it is combined with efforts to 
encourage highrisk women to be tested 
according to the study 
women at high risk of cervical cancer are smokers poor 
nonwhite were young at first intercourse and have had multiple 
sexual partners 
studies have found that women who have been screened are 
onehalf to onetenth as likely to develop cervical cancer as other 
women 
elderly women appear to have lower rates of localized 
noninvasive cervical tumors than younger women but the elderly 
have higher rates of invasive cervical cancer and higher death 
rates from cervical cancer 
since elderly women are less likely to be screened for cervical 
cancer than younger women older women are more likely to be in 
advanced stages of the disease when it is diagnosed 
citing national cancer institute figures for 1985 the report 
said 11 white women per 100000 under 50 but 24 black women 
died of cervical cancer among women over 50 the rate was 75 for 
whites and 211 for blacks 
the average medicare payment for a pap smear will be 1137 
though actual physician and laboratory charges may be higher the 
report said the program will cover pap tests once every three 
years

fifteen years after the death of a law 
enforcement officers wife was ruled an accident her daughters 
longdormant memories have led authorities to call it a homicide 
wilma anderson graham died on her kitchen floor in april 1975 
with two knife wounds in her heart and other wounds on her hands 
and arms all suffered during a struggle with her husband kenneth 
graham 
graham claimed that his wife plunged the knife into her own 
chest then later slipped and fell on the blade as he tried to keep 
her from stabbing herself a second time 
while alachua county authorities concluded it was an accident 
someone else reached a different conclusion 
paula hearndon 29 who witnessed at least part of the struggle 
between her mother and stepfather said it was murder 
for 14 years she said she suppressed the traumatic memory 
but a year ago after repeated flashbacks allowed her to recall 
more and more of what happened she told authorities she remembers 
seeing graham pull the knife out of her mother and stab her again 
at the request of gov bob martinez the florida department of 
law enforcement reopened the investigation 
in a report released monday the department concluded that mrs 
graham was the victim of a homicide and that there is probable 
cause to believe that kenneth graham committed the crime 
the report also criticized the chief investigator for the state 
attorneys office a friend of grahams for overlooking and 
discounting key facts during the original investigation 
when the department took the case to a grand jury last month 
jurors had two choices to indict for firstdegree murder or not 
indict at all the statute of limitations has expired on any lesser 
charge 
the grand jury declined to issue an indictment instead they 
issued a report that is sealed by the court ms hearndons 
attorneys are seeking to make that report public in hopes of 
reopening the case 
graham is a former fbi agent former alachua county sheriffs 
deputy police academy instructor community college security 
director and associated with many law enforcement officials in 
gainesville 
he declined to discuss the case this week but his attorney 
larry turner of gainesville said he is convinced that mrs 
grahams death was accidental 
the grand jury didnt indict him 14 years ago or this time and 
this is what matters turner said im surprised and skeptical 
of a sudden restoration of memory after 14 years 
but ms hearndon and her attorney norm lacoe suggest that 
grahams close ties to law enforcement caused a miscarriage of 
justice 15 years ago and they are not confident the renewed 
investigation will do much more 
i dont have any confidence in anything any more ms 
hearndon said last week i want the world to know this guy is a 
murderer

six senators called tuesday for a complete 
cutoff of us aid to el salvador saying the millions now sent by 
the united states make it an accomplice in repression and death 
squad murders 
the legislation which has little chance of passage was an 
apparent effort by senate liberals to increase pressure on the 
government of alfredo cristiani to undertake negotiations with 
leftist rebels to pursue further prosecutions in the murders last 
year of six jesuit priests and to reform the military 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said while there has been 
progress in the murder investigation trials are scheduled to 
begin in may for eight military men it is too little and too 
late 
serious questions remain about whether justice is being done 
in these particularly brutal murders including whether all those 
involved in the massacre have been identified kennedy said at a 
news conference 
asked about the case during a visit to washington last week 
cristiani said we are not here to do justice by using scapegoats 
or by speculation we will only go by the results of a 
professional investigation 
the judicial process at least at the beginning is working 
well and moving forward cristiani added 
at the state department spokesman richard boucher said tuesday 
that the us government president cristiani and the high 
command of the salvadoran military all share the view that heinous 
crimes such as these should be investigated and that the 
perpetrators should be brought to justice 
in addition to kennedy sponsors of the bill are sens john 
kerry dmass barbara mikulski dmd paul simon dill alan 
cranston dcalif and brock adams dwash 
congress after the murders last year of the priests their 
housekeeper and her daughter declined to attach strings to us 
aid to el salvador that aid will total about 315 million this 
year including military economic food and development aid 
since then cristiani has surprised many by pursuing the case 
and bringing indictments against the soldiers

an underground electrical accident shut down all 
train service to grand central terminal for three hours tuesday 
authorities said ten workers were injured 
the 1238 pm accident in a tunnel beneath the waldorfastoria 
hotel set off a smoky fire said metronorth railroad spokesman 
dan brucker 
limited service into and out of grand central resumed at 330 
pm the railroad said but some tracks were without power 
widespread track and time changes were expected throughout the 
evening rush hour for the railroads 85000 daily commuters a 
spokeswoman said 
by 4 pm hundreds of commuters stood in grand central terminal 
staring at the indicator board and trying to determine when and 
from where their trains might leave several trains listed as 
delayed had been assigned track numbers and taken on passengers 
metronorth employees walked around the station offering 
assistance 
up in westchester were a little more civil said lucille 
declet of bronxville north of new york city the farther north 
you go the more that holds true 
the lobby crowd was thick but not overflowing and by 445 pm 
announcements of train departures were coming more frequently 
bob reilly of brewster stood on a staircase and had just 
finished complaining its a mess nothings moving i knew i 
should have taken the bus when the announcer called his train 
the 415 pm 
after the accident smoke from the blaze floated up into the 
hotel and into the train station a halfdozen blocks away said 
fire department spokesman efrain parrilla the fire was 
extinguished within about an hour he said

but ducts were closed immediately and the problem was minor 
railroad spokeswoman marjorie anders said a 28ton tamping 
machine used to pack down ballast around the tracks 
accidentally cut into a thirdrail power feeder cable that cable 
shorted out created that big popping sizzling explosive sound and 
it shorted out along the cable into a splicing chamber where there 
are a lot of other cables thats where all the smoke came 
from 
ten metronorth workers suffered smoke inhalation said capt 
ellen scibelli of the emergency medical service three of them were 
taken to a hospital and the others were treated at the scene

a labor department plan to scale back an 
employment program for older americans came under fire tuesday from 
a senate chairman who complained it would hurt 10000 impoverished 
senior citizens 
labor secretary elizabeth dole appearing before a senate 
appropriations subcommittee to push the agencys 263 billion 
budget said the bush administration chose to cut 14 million from 
the program because of overall budget constraints 
under the program older citizens are placed in community 
service jobs such as in hospitals schools and libraries the jobs 
usually pay the minimum wage 
its a great employment opportunity that keeps elderly 
americans off welfare and gives them some respect some dignity 
said sen tom harkin diowa and committee chairman this is one 
cut that just does not make sense 
president bushs budget proposes that 343 million be spent on 
the program in budget year 1991 357 million went for it in the 
current fiscal year 
its a result of the budget constraints i wish that it did 
not have to be so mrs dole said 
harkin noting that the hourly minimum wage is set to increase 
from 335 to 425 next year said the job program would require 
more funding just to employ the same number of older americans in 
1991 as in the 1990 budget year 
he suggested funding be restored through the supplemental 
appropriations process to account for the minimum wage difference 
but mrs dole said that process should be reserved for dire 
emergencies 
dire emergency is in the eye of the beholder harkin said 
on another budget issue mrs dole said the departments 
proposed 2526 million increase for new youth job training 
programs would provide help to an estimated 683000 of the nations 
most atrisk youth 
if were going to remain competitive in a global market we 
must address ourselves to this skills gap and a motivational gap 
that exists in many areas as well mrs dole said 
she said the department was working on ways to help high school 
students make the transition to the workforce since many now 
kick around for a couple of years trying to find the right spot 
many senators praised the labor secretary for her role in 
bringing about a tentative settlement in the pittstonunited mine 
workers strike but she again found herself explaining the 
governments handsoff approach at eastern air lines where 
machinists remain on strike 
i think you always have to go case by case mrs dole said 
citing different federal labor laws that govern the transportation 
industry she also said the strike was not causing an emergency in 
the airline industry 
this was not the kind of situation that would tie up 
transportation in a section of the country she said

president mikhail s gorbachevs proposal for 
reforming the communist party would be the climax of a fiveyear 
squeeze play against elderly hardliners of the central committee 
gorbachev took the helm of the communist party in march 1985 and 
since then has almost completely changed the 12man politburo 
which handles everyday business but he still cannot count on a 
majority on the 249member central committee the one body with the 
power to fire him 
to push through radical changes such as mondays call for the 
party to give up its monopoly on power gorbachev needs central 
committee members who pulse with fresh young blood as the 
newspaper argumenti i fakti put it this week 
the newspaper in a scathing indictment of the age and tenure of 
the party leadership noted that 61 percent of the central 
commmittee members were past retirement age and some have been in 
positions of power almost since josef stalins time many were 
appointed only to qualify for personal pensions lavish 
retirement benefits reserved for the nations elite the article 
found 
the party hardly has the right having chosen such a central 
committee to expect dynamism revolutionary energy flexibility 
and extraordinary thinking the article concluded 
gorbachevs proposal for secret multicandidate elections of 
delegates to the party congress which elects the central 
committee would result in replacing all but perhaps 10 percent of 
the current members estimated justis paletskis ideology secretary 
for the breakaway lithuanian communist party 
paletskis is one of hundreds of progressive party leaders 
invited to attend and speak at this weeks crucial central 
committee meeting guests cannot vote on the final document but 
paletskis said he is certain the election proposal will be approved 
while gorbachev is changing the rules of the game at the top 
pressure from rankandfile communists and nonparty members alike 
is providing the bottom jaw of the vise 
highranking local party officials were embarrassed in national 
elections last year when voters were given a choice for the first 
time in decades a repeat performance is likely this spring when 
elections for local and republic governing councils are held 
in recent weeks local communist leaders also have been facing a 
new phenomenon largescale protests that have forced them to quit 
their posts party leaders in the siberian petroleum center of 
tyumen the southern russian river city of volgograd and the 
industrial cities of chernigov in the ukraine and sverdlovsk in the 
ural mountains all were forced out by popular discontent 
these actions likely will serve as a example for other 
disgruntled soviets 
party rules still hobble gorbachevs maneuvering they have 
prevented him from adding anyone to the central committee since the 
last party congress in march 1986 
at that time he managed to change onethird of the group that 
had been elected under leonid i brezhnev but he had been in power 
for only a year and his own grip still was tenuous 
he dropped 10 of his original 108 appointees last april another 
has died he promoted 24 in april but had only the ranks of 
candidate members also chosen in march 1986 from which to choose 
candidate members do not vote 
that means only 121 of central committees 249 members just 
less than 50 percent were appointed under gorbachev many were far 
from being strong supporters of reform and only a handful are 
clearly identifiable gorbachev allies 
among rankandfile communists many express doubt about the 
possibility of the central committee as it is currently constituted 
to adopt radical decisions about reform y a gankovsky a 
siberian party leader told tuesdays meeting 
gorbachev twice has sought and failed to win a mandatory 
retirement age or a limit of two fiveyear terms for party 
officials in hopes of weeding out more deadwood 
most of the 74 people retired last april were socalled dead 
souls named after a famous russian novel by nikolai gogol these 
are people who have lost the jobs that entitled them to a central 
committee slot 
now less than a year later western diplomats estimate there 
are 50 to 60 more dead souls they include dzhumber patiashvili 
the former party chief in georgia who was ousted after being blamed 
for ordering troops to clear a crowd of peaceful independence 
protesters resulting in 19 deaths 
with the prospect of real political competition coming up on the 
horizon gorbachev needs to remove such unpopular figures from the 
leadership as the party competees for power

eighty percent of the secret police have 
been fired the telephones of opposition activists are no longer 
tapped and other reforms are being made in the security services 
the interior minister said tuesday 
gen atanas semerdjiev said a prison camp on the danube river 
island of belene one of the most typical symbols of the old 
regime many of whose inmates have been wrongfully convicted 
would be closed 
semerdjiev spent five hours at a meeting of the communist party 
and opposition leaders condemning past abuses and promising to make 
his ministry a guardian of society the official news agency 
bta reported 
he rejected opposition demands for access to secret police files 
and a public investigation of state security citing constitutional 
prohibitions he did not specify the agency said 
semerdjiev made his presentation four days after a communist 
party congress that sought to bridge differences between reformers 
and party conservatives seeking to preserve communist domination of 
bulgarian society 
bulgaria has followed its east european neighbors in promising 
to remodel the interior ministry which is responsible for the 
police agencies that have repressed the people with survellience 
and force 
the communist party remains in firm control in bulgaria 
however and the public s skeptical of the legitimacy of change 
even after the election last week of moderate reformers as prime 
minister and party leader 
although they participate in the weekly negotiations with the 
party opposition leaders have refused to join a provisional 
government to run the country until free elections scheduled for 
may 
the union of democratic forces opposition alliance describes the 
communist proposal of a government of national concord as too 
vague and says that because the party controls parliament there 
is little chance of a real opposition role 
in the bta report of tuesdays negotiations the interior 
ministry was described as becoming new and modern independent 
of any political party and guided solely by the interests of the 
people and the state 
bta said the traditional structures of state security had 
been disbanded 
it quoted semerdjiev as saying the security and protection 
department had been replaced by a security service onefifth its 
size and that the security service and a new national intelligence 
service would report directly to the head of state 
a new national service for protection of the constitution was 
being formed and its composition would be announced to parliament 
soon the report said 
semerdjiev said the criminal investigation unit was being taken 
out of the interior ministry and would be reorganized as a national 
investigation service reporting to parliament 
we dont want to be regarded as a shield and a sword any 
longer he said we want to be seen as a guardian of society 
and the people in the noblest sense of the word 
he said the interior minister employs no more than 50000 people 
and is being reduced dramatically especially in senior 
positions bta quoted him as saying those who have committeed 
abuses in the past can no longer serve the bta report said 
semerdjiev told participants in the talks neither their telephones 
nor those of intellectuals were being tapped and signed a 
pledge that no listening devices were installed in union of 
democratic forces offices 
when the minister acknowledged past abuses and apologized 
premier andrei lukanov said without elaborating that he qualified 
for an apology because his telephone also had been tapped bta 
reported 
semerdjiev said monitoring would not stop but would be carried 
out in compliance with the constitution with orders from a court 
or prosecutor

the us trade deficit with japan is declining 
but higher us import prices may be needed to bring the results 
wanted by congress officials of the japanese government and 
industry said tuesday 
congress wants a quick fix so your demand for imports has 
to go down said kazuo nukazawa managing director of the 
powerful japan federation of economic organizations 
he and masaru yoshitomi director of the governments economic 
planning agency gave reporters an array of figures showing strong 
growth of american exports to japan but accompanied by continued 
growth of us imports 
a better trade balance will mean lowering us demand for 
imports by cheapening the value of the us dollar and driving up 
the value of the japanese yen to make japanese goods cost americans 
more said nukazawa 
the officials suggested an exchange rate of 90100 yen per 
dollar one dollar currently buys about 145 yen compared to as few 
as 120 yen last year 240 yen in 1985 and 360 yen for several years 
after world war ii 
some economists said those proposals could translate into 
lowered consumption by americans triggering a recession 
but our confidence in the american economy is much higher than 
your confidence nukazawa said predicting there would be no 
recession if the united states maintains a modest 1 percent to 15 
percent annual economic growth 
the best thing he said would be to induce the american 
people to spend less and save more to provide more investment 
capital the slowly rising us savings rate is 4 percent to 5 
percent compared to 12 percent in western europe he said 
japanese real estate investors are becoming hesitant about 
buying up us landmark properties such as skyscrapers and new 
yorks rockefeller center because theose investors are becoming 
aware of the negative public reaction aroused in the united states 
by highprofile purchases nukazawa said 
predicting the criticism of foreigners buying up america 
would blow over he said the united states has a very strong 
stomach it can digest almost everything now you love gorby two 
years ago you hated him nukazawa said referring to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
nukazawa and yoshitomi have been holding informal talks with 
officials of the bush administration members of congress and 
business leaders in washington and new york

housing and urban development officials said 
tuesday they have found no evidence that quadruple dipping salary 
abuses uncovered in a local new jersey housing authority exist 
elsewhere but added they are expanding an investigation to find out 
we are informed this is a unique situation hud general 
counsel frank keating told a house subcommittee were in the 
process of expanding this nationally 
hud officials said they will first put together strike forces to 
examine 20 more local housing agencies in new jersey 
it may well be there are no other passaics keating said 
paul adams the departments inspector general said the federal 
government was likely defrauded when the passaic nj housing 
authoritys commissioners approved more than 245000 in 1988 to 
pay executive director paul marguglio four salaries for four job 
titles 
i think thats a reasonable assumption adams told rep tom 
lantos dcalif adding that his office is conducting a criminal 
investigation of the passaic agency 
lantos chairman of the house government operations employment 
and housing subcommittee questioned how marguglio could find 
enough hours in the day to perform two fulltime jobs and two 
parttime jobs and still have enough time left over to earn 
47115 for timeandahalf compensatory pay 
local housing authority executives are prohibited from earning 
overtime compensation adams said 
lantos also questioned the 95000 paid between january 1986 and 
april 1988 to marguglios wife louise including 50000 in 
disability pay that an audit called improper the audit said mrs 
marguglio worked only one day in that period 
it seems to me this was a system designed to fail said rep 
christopher shays rconn this was a ripoff and it was a ripoff 
in which the commissioners participated 
housing secretary jack kemp on jan 22 suspended marguglio and 
four other passaic officials and authorized a strike force to 
examine housing authorities across new jersey including perth 
amboy 
under extensive questioning paul kane huds regional inspector 
general for the northeast acknowledged problems in passaic were 
first hinted at in a 1985 report 
rep donald payne a newark nj democrat called it 
unconscionable that hud failed to pursue tenant complaints as far 
back as 1982 to thenhousing secretary samuel r pierce jr 
marguglio and his wife declined to testify tuesday and face 
subpoenas if they do not volunteer to appear at the next session on 
the passaic agency lantos said 
three of passaics suspended housing officials august c 
michaelis chief counsel to the agency peter marrocco the 
authoritys chairman and william p scruggs the boards vice 
chairman have indicated willingness to testify lantos said 
a federal judge in newark on thursday will review last weeks 
decision to grant hud temporary control of the authority three of 
the suspended officials have filed papers seeking reinstatement 
lantos decision to call the hearing marks a resumption of last 
years subcommittee focus on the multibilliondollar scandal of 
influencepeddling fraud and mismanagement at hud during the 
reagan administration 
attorney general dick thornburgh last week asked a federal court 
to appoint an independent counsel to investigate fraud allegations 
against former pierce and others

afternoons at the beach jobs and summer 
loves will have to be squeezed into the schedule of los angeles 
public school students as the traditional threemonth vacation 
becomes a thing of the past 
beginning in july 1991 all 646 schools in the los angeles 
unified school district will go on a yearround schedule 102 los 
angeles schools already operate yearround 
the plan will about double the number of us schools on 
yearround schedules and provide an impetus for other districts to 
adopt such plans proponents said 
it will put increasing pressure on other city districts to 
reevaluate the wisdom of remaining on an agriculturally based 
calender said charles ballinger executive director of the 
national council on yearround education in san diego 
approved by a 43 school board vote monday it is intended to 
ease severe school overcrowding in the 594802student los angeles 
district second in size only to new york citys district 
for 10thgrader michelle smith the new schedule will cut into 
her traditional summer plans and social life 
i dont like it because all my friends go to private school 
and they dont have yearround school so i cant be with them 
she said i also wont be able to go to summer camp which is all 
summer long 
but sarah ponce another 10thgrader said shes keeping an open 
mind 
id be willing to try it its a new experience maybe id be 
able to do different things like over the winter she said 
maybe it would conflict with a lot of things but i could 
probably work around it 
what most concerns many parents and students is the yearround 
schedules overlapping track system of enrollment in which 
different blocks of students begin the year at different times and 
have different vacations 
all students will have shorter summer vacations and longer 
winter vacations most students will have the same number of days 
off as before but some will have to go a week or two extra 
the system will give schools as many as four student body 
presidents one for each track and disrupt interscholastic 
sports 
my feeling is that youre going to lose some kids from teams 
when theyre off track and on vacation or something you could lose 
a key kid and cost you a full season said duane larue athletic 
director at university high school 
parents expressed mixed emotions about yearround schools 
some were happy that the schools should be less crowded and 
their children will be home fewer summer days but others 
complained the schedule will disrupt vacation plans and leave them 
with children around the house during the winter 
we have parents who think its wonderful and we have parents 
who think its the worse thing that ever happened it depends on 
their lifestyle said barbara topkis president of one of the two 
parentteacher association districts in los angeles 
students and teachers at the schools now on yearround schedules 
said the plan works well with only a few minor glitches 
yanira perez a 10thgrader said the yearround schedule still 
leaves time to work at a clothing store after work and gives her 
more hours to work over the winter when many students are still in 
school 
a lot of students like it this way were all used to it 
she said

india on tuesday accused pakistan of 
causing border tensions and said it was prepared militarily for any 
threat from islamabad 
we urge upon pakistan authorities to heed to our request and 
scale down the propaganda level foreign ministry spokesman aftab 
seth said 
indian border guards fired monday on a mob of 4000 pakistani 
protesters some of whom crossed into indian territory in the 
northern state of jammukashmir where moslem separatists are 
demanding independence 
officials said no pakistanis were killed but indian newspapers 
and pakistani officials reported deaths 
the indian government began a crackdown on moslem separatists in 
the kashmir region of jammukashmir state on jan 20 and at least 
77 indians have been killed in clashes between protesters and 
security forces 
police sources said moslem militants tuesday bombed an empty bus 
on the outskirts of srinagar kashmirs largest town and threw a 
grenade at a paramilitary patrol wounding three people 
amnesty international said monday that indian security forces 
searched for survivors at the height of the protests last month in 
order to kill them the lononbased human rights group quoting 
witnesses also said some protesters were shot from behind 
it acknowledged that security forces faced a difficult situation 
in maintaining order and also that police were killed in the 
clashes 
but it called for an investigation into the killings and urged 
the governor of jammukashmir to order troops not to use lethal 
force on demonstrators unless their own lives were at risk 
indian officials said about 10 people were wounded monday during 
the pakistani border demonstration 
pakistani officials said one person was killed and 13 were shot 
in the legs two indian newspapers also reported fatalities the 
progovernment times of india said 10 people were killed while the 
statesman an independent paper said three died 
we do not want to sound alarmist but we regard all such 
unprovoked incidents as serious seth said 
we are fully prepared on the military level seth said he 
did not elaborate 
seth said three more antiindian demonstrations were held on the 
pakistan side of the frontier tuesday but that the protesters did 
not try to cross into india 
both days the demonstrators shouted slogans in protest of 
indias crackdown on the moslem separatists 
the pakistanbased leader of moslem militants who support the 
separatist movement in india promised tuesday to rein in his 
emotionally charged followers 
i have issued a sort of martial law order to our people today 
to not storm across the border said amanullah khan chairman of 
the jammukashmir liberation front 
his decree generated threats of mutiny particularly among 
student in his organization khan said in islamabad pakistans 
capital but greater tension between india and pakistan would hurt 
their cause he said if there is a war well be sandwiched in 
between and made a scapegoat 
india accuses pakistan of aiding the militants in kashmir a 
predominantly moslem region claimed both by india and pakistan 
pakistan routinely denies the charge but says it supports the 
separatists quest for selfdetermination 
about 64 percent of jammukashmirs 5 million people are moslem 
making it the only moslemmajority state among predominantly hindu 
indias 25 states 
india and moslem pakistan were formed largely along religious 
lines when the indian subcontinent gained independence from britain 
in 1947 
jammukashmir is part of a larger kashmir that was divided into 
indian and pakistani segments after the nations went to war in 
1948 a un monitored ceasefire line separates the regions 
the two countries went to war again over kashmir in 1965 but 
the border question is still unresolved

dissident black roman catholic priest george 
a stallings said tuesday he will remain a priest despite his 
formal separation from the church and the creation of his 
independent africanamerican catholic congregation 
the church teaches you that once a priest always a priest 
stallings said i have also statedthat the roman catholic 
church cannot excommunicate me or anyone else 
the archdiocese of washington on monday issued a statement 
saying stallings effectively excommunicated himself following his 
public renunciation of church teaching 
stallings also declared that there was nothing in catholic 
doctrine that prohibited the use of birth control or prohibited 
women from being priests 
the priest announced recently that his africanamerican 
congregation would an autonomous and independent congregation that 
would no longer answer to rome 
eileen marx a spokeswoman for the archdiocese said tuesday 
that stallings would remain a priest but one no longer associated 
with the roman catholic church 
it is true that in the catholic church once a priest always a 
priest but the church can also regulate who is to speak in her 
name ms marx said he is no longer authorized to speak as a 
roman catholic priest in the churchs name 
stallings said his formal separation from the catholic church 
would allow his own congregation to solidify its discipline and 
laws 
we have no desire to in any way denounce our catholicism he 
told reporters and we will remain true to revealed doctrine of 
the catholic faith and continue to give full expression of 
catholicism out of an africanamerican perspective 
stallings said that revealed doctrine will include the 
ordination of women the marriage of priests the use of birth 
control and allowing divorced or remarried catholics to be in full 
communion without the annulment process 
the africanamerican catholic congregation holds to the 
sanctity of life from the moment of conception to birth 
stallings said but ultimately it is the responsibility of the 
woman who must stand before god to render an account for her action 
and her conduct to make that decision for which only she alone can 
be held responsible

civil rights forces split tuesday as the naacp 
promised not to fight confirmation of conservative clarence thomas 
as an appeals judge while other groups assailed his record as 
chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission 
while we cannot give him our unqualified endorsement we will 
however not oppose the nomination naacp executive director 
benjamin l hooks said in a statement as the senate judiciary 
committee conducted its confirmation hearing 
thomas 41 one of the more prominent blacks in the reagan and 
bush administrations came in for criticism from representatives of 
working women and senior citizens groups 
the nomination of thomas to succeed robert bork on the us 
court of appeals in washington once appeared likely to trigger 
concerted resistance from the cvil rights community 
in recent days however the naacp balked hooks did say that 
we do have questions about his management of eeoc 
thomas told the senators that as an appeals judge he would not 
have the option of roaming unfettered through judicial terrain 
and injecting his personal views into decisions 
he vowed to faithfully adhere to the supreme court decisions 
and not torture a case to reach a preconceived notion of what a 
result should be 
thomas acknowledged that the statute of limitations on 900 cases 
of alleged bias against the elderly lapsed before the commission 
acted on them he accepted responsibility it happened on my 
watch he said 
but he said the reason was that he intiated more extensive 
investigative procedures and the new program may have been too 
ambitious 
sen howell heflin dala told thomas there as a lot of 
debate over whether the correct number was 13000 cases rather 
than 900 
thomas said with regard to the number 13000 i dont have 
the slightest idea where that number comes from 
thomas said in response to a question that as a conservative he 
holds a number of positions at odds with an expected orthodoxy 
from black americans he said criticism from civil rights groups 
over his views is something that is uncomfortable but it is 
something that ill have to live with 
i think the choice between principle and popularity is 
something that each individual will have to make and ive made mine 
and ill live with the consequences thomas said 
sen john c danforth rmo who twice hired thomas as an aide 
praised him as a person who calls them as he sees them 
frankly i have questions about the nominees commitment to 
the law said sen howard m metzenbaum dohio he said 
however we havent always agreed but i respect your views 
nancy kreiter of chicago research director of the women 
employed institute told the committee that under thomas the 
commission failed to fulfill its mandate to protect the rights of 
victims of discrimination 
mr thomas actions in the areas of policy and enforcement 
performance demonstrate a lack of respect for law and a disregard 
for individuals she said a careful look at his record 
raises serious questions about his qualifications for a lifetime 
appointment to administer justice on the federal bench 
she said enforcement by the commission has been lax while there 
has been slippage in staff competence 
rutgers law professor alfred w blumrose an advocate of rights 
for senior citizens told the committee that the commission had 
apparently violated its own regulations by eliminating a policy of 
persuing hiring goals and timetables in 1985 without taking any 
formal action under the federal governments sunshine law 
he said there was a sort of quiet suggestion by innuendo 
leading the lawyers in the agency to alter the process he said 
he believed the action to be illegal the agency can suspend the 
policy what they cannot do is simply slide away from the 
policy he said

a commission has been established to 
investigate complaints against security forces that put down the 
violent ethnic unrest in kosovo province the police chief said 
tuesday 
chief jusuf karakusi told kosovos parliament that 26 ethnic 
albanians had been killed in clashes with police since the latest 
round of protests started jan 24 he said 94 demonstrators had 
been wounded by gunfire and 83 police officers had suffered various 
injuries 
ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of kosovos 19 million 
people and thousands have taken to the streets to demand more 
autonomy for the province which is part of the republic of serbia 
serbia tightened its control of kosovos police judiciary and 
schools last year saying the measures were necessary to protect 
the serbian minority in the province the actions sparked violent 
demonstrations and kosovo has been under virtual martial law for a 
year 
ethnic albanian leaders have been critical of what they call 
indiscriminate use of force by security forces seeking to quell the 
recent unrest 
one ethnic albanian delegate cemail bairam told parliament he 
had witnessed uncontrolled shooting by police in the village of 
malisevo 
he said the killings cannot be justified by anything 
until an investigation identifies those responsible tension 
will remain high in kosovo bairam said 
the security forces backed by columns of tanks and lowflying 
air force jets and helicopters have kept an uneasy calm and no 
additional deaths have been reported since feb 2 
karakusi told the legislature about 1000 protesters had been 
arrested and that 200 of them had been sentenced by magistrate 
courts to up to 60 days in jail 
tensions rose tuesday night in janjevo a town 16 miles 
southwest of pristina when a serbian police officer apparently 
drunk shot two ethnic albanian teenage boys in the legs and 
harassed residents the mayor and other witnesses said 
the officer opened fire after he was seen drinking at a bar 
mayor josip dodid said he said the boys were hospitalized for 
treatment and that the unidentified officer was arrested 
about 20000 people massed on the downtown street in front of 
the parliament tuesday to pay homage to those killed in the 
protests 
as car horns sounded people in the crowd raised their hands in 
the v for victory salute and shouted glory to the dead they 
then dispersed peacefully as police watched 
ethnic albanians also observed a minute of silence at 2 pm for 
a second day in honor of the dead 
about 20000 people gathered in the provincial capital of 
pristina tuesday night lighting thousands of candles they then 
left on sidewalks 
protest leaders have called for the release of jailed ethnic 
albanian activists and free elections to replace provincial 
officials they say are loyal to serbia 
the leadership of yugoslavias liberal northern republic of 
slovenia called for the lifting of the yearlong state of emergency 
in kosovo 
the presidency of the slovenian socialist alliance a 
communistdominated mass organization said the problems of the 
region should be resolved by democratic means and appealed for 
an end to demonstrations of force by the serbian leadership 
slobodan milosevic the president of the serbian republic has 
accused slovenia and neighboring croatia of supporting albanian 
terrorists in kosovo

the army said tuesday it has begun punishing 
palestinians who hurl rocks at israelis by sealing off their houses 
or blocking off individual rooms 
the policy which could affect hundreds of families in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip drew immediate criticism from 
civil rights groups and liberal politicians who said the measure 
amounts to collective punishment 
also tuesday two israeli civilians shot and killed a 
palestinian who stoned their truck and 33 other palestinians were 
wounded in clashes with israeli troops the army and arab reports 
said 
col ahaz benari the armys legal adviser for the west bank 
said the new penalty was necessary because of the danger of 
stonethrowing the main tactic of the nearly 26monthold 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
because this phenomenon is still deeply rooted and lately to 
our great regret is on an increase it was decided to widen this 
sanction for this phenomenon in an attempt to quell it benari 
said 
since the arab uprising broke out in december 1987 the army has 
destroyed or sealed at least 395 homes to punish arabs suspected of 
firebomb or other serious attacks but the penalty was not usually 
used for rockthrowing 
the army generally seals rooms or whole houses by blocking the 
doors and windows with concrete blocks or bricks and cement 
sometimes the family is told to do the labor at times the army 
has welded metal doors or shutters shut 
the first sealings under the new policy occurred overnight in 
the west bank the army said several rooms of a house in nablus 
were blocked off because one family member threw a rock through a 
cars windshield injuring the israeli driver 
in the town of qalqilya several rooms were sealed off in the 
home of a palestinian charged with wounding a border policeman with 
a stone 
the families were allowed to remain in one room of each house 
the army said it did not say how many members there were in each 
family 
also tuesday mustafa abed kulab 45 a palestinian bus driver 
was fatally shot when israeli civilians opened fire after their 
fuel truck was stoned in nablus arab reports said 
the army said police were questioning the driver and his 
security guard who said they fired in the air after the stoning 
kulabs death raised to 652 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians since the palestinian uprising began 
in addition 181 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaboration with israel fortythree 
israelis have died 
in the occupied gaza strip 22 palestinians were shot and 
wounded by israeli troops in stonethrowing clashes in the rafah 
refugee camp arab reports said 
they said the clashes broke out as students were leaving their 
schools and that the injured ranged in age from 13 to 17 
eleven other palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes 
elsewhere in the coastal strip arab reports said 
the army confirmed four injuries and said it was checking 
further 
the new house sealing policy was immediately challenged by 
parliament member dedi zucker of the leftleaning citizens rights 
movement as another escalation of the circle of hate he said 
it constituted punishment without trial 
khaled batrawi of law in the service of man a palestinianrun 
human rights group said the policy was illegal 
demolitions and house sealings constitute collective 
punishment that is prohibited by international law and they 
violate the 4th geneva convention he said 
the 4th geneva convention to which israel is a signatory 
protects the rights of civilians during war and under occupation 
the united states and international human rights organizations 
also have repeatedly criticized demolitions and sealings noting 
that the action almost always takes place before the suspect is 
tried 
liberal parliament members have proposed legislation that would 
make the 4th geneva convention part of israeli law 
amnon rubinstein a member of the leftwing shinui party said 
the legislation would oblige israel to honor the humanitarian 
regulations

senate negotiators have reached tentative 
compromises on several key portions of cleanair legislation 
including tighter controls on toxic industrial releases senate 
sources said tuesday 
progress also was made toward an agreement over tighter emission 
controls from automobiles with discussion of a proposal aimed at 
easing auto industry opposition the sources said 
but the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
cautioned that major parts of the pollutioncontrol package 
including the one dealing with acid rain have yet to be considered 
and even the compromises already worked out are tenuous 
right now youre in the middle of some very delicate 
bargaining said one senate staff member 
as negotiators broke after a daylong session senate sources 
said a tentative compromise had been reached on auto questions 
between majority leader george mitchell dmaine and sen carl 
levin dmich who has been a strong opponent of tougher auto 
exhauswt controls 
while the mitchelllevin compromise would retain tough 
secondstage tailpipe standards scheduled to go into effect in the 
year 2003 it leaves a way for the environmental protection agency 
to return to congress in six years to scrap those requirements 
the compromise also eliminates a provision that automakers 
develop cars with greater fuel efficiency by meeting new carbon 
dioxide emission requirements a portion of the senate bill that 
environmentalists have argued is key to dealing with global warming 
one source close to the discussions said the bush administration 
had not yet agreed to the compromise however 
additionally sens max baucus dmont and john chafee 
rri the two floor leaders of the bill were said to be unhappy 
about the revised auto tailpipe agreement 
while not commenting directly on the compromises baucus said 
tuesday he wants to make sure that all that has been written 
into the legislation in public is not unwritten in these closed 
sessions 
the private meetings which have been going on for more than a 
week include the democratic and republican leadership as well as 
senior officials from both the enviornmental protection agency and 
the white house 
good progress is being made said senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine who has been orchestrating the private 
talks 
the senate cleanair bill which is tougher on polluters than 
either a house version or legislation sought by president bush has 
been the target of intense attack by industry especially utilities 
and automakers who charge it is far too costly and restrictive 
mitchell said he hoped to reach overall agreement on the 
legislation this week but acknowledged that he has yet to gather 
enough support to head off a possible filibuster when the bill is 
taken up on the senate floor in the coming days 
i think that is a probability mitchell said when asked 
about a potential filibuster which would stall progress on the 
legislation 
in addition to the pollution controls on automobiles according 
to the sources the private talks also have produced tentative 
agreements on 
a provision requiring industry to install the best available 
technology to curb toxic chemical releases and eventually meet 
specific health standards based on cancer risk 
the compromise however would make it easier for industrial 
plants to avoid the healthstandard requirement because it requires 
the epa to adopt a real world procedure taking into account 
circumstances at specific plant sites to determine cancer risks 
instead of the mathematical models now used 
tougher pollution controls on a broad range of businesses and 
industrial plants in urban areas that are failing to meet federal 
air quality standards the compromise however exempts smaller 
polluters by raising the cutoff for emission levels 
in addition there is agreement that the bill would contain no 
requirement for automakers to produce or sell alternativefuel 
automobiles chafee and other senators had hoped to insert such a 
requirement on the senate floor

power supplies were disrupted public 
transport was halted and ports remained closed tuesday as the 
countrys unions pressed their challenge of government austerity 
policies 
public power corp employees began a 48hour nationwide strike 
and demanded a 43 percent wage increase over inflation which was 
141 percent last year 
power failures occurred in the capital periodically and the 
fire department reported 750 people had been trapped in elevators 
traffic lights worked only intermittently creating chaos at 
intersections 
the countrys 2800 longshoremen entered their fourth day of an

waiting to enter piraeus the countrys main port 
several unions have staged crippling strikes in key industries 
since the beginning of the year demanding the government back down 
on its austerity policy and continue to hire public employees 
the nations largest labor organization the general 
confederation of greek labor warned that it will call on its 13 
million members to stage a 24hour general strike this month the 
second this year 
the organization is demanding a national general labor 
agreement that would include assurances of wage increases over 
inflation the federation of greek industrialists so far has 
refused to consider this 
premier xenophon zolotas has said repeatedly that his government 
cannot raise wages in the face of inflation expected to run at 17 
percent this year and a 18 billion budget deficit 
zolotas said monday the government could do no more than repeat 
a promise to protect present wages from inflation 
he chastized trade unions for staging daily protests in central 
athens blocking streets and occupying public buildings he said 
the demonstrations presented a climate of anarchy and discouraged 
foreign investment 
the 85yearold zolotas was appointed to head a government 
coalition after inconclusive elections in november 
the government is supported by the conservative socialist and 
communist parties and has a mandate to work on economic problems 
before holding elections on april 8

artists professors and veterans of the 
free speech movement on tuesday unveiled finalists in a contest to 
commemorate the protest that was the forerunner of a decade of 
dissent 
the proposals for the monument to be built with private 
donations and given to the university of california at berkeley 
include a metal soap box a suspended electronic billboard 
broadcasting computer messages from around the world giant cracks 
in a plaza bricks inscribed with speeches and an autonomous 
nation within a 6inch circle 
the idea of freedom of speech and action should be 
memorialized and done so in the place where it all started said 
peter selz former chief curator of the museum of modern art in new 
york and a project organizer 
the sculpture to be commissioned with 70000 has revived a 
bitter debate over the movements legacy at berkeley which sparked 
four months of demonstrations in 1964 after the school banned 
political activities on campus 
student tactics including sitins humorous music fetes and an 
alternative press became the model for the 10 years of civil 
rights and antiwar demonstrations that followed 
chancellor ira michael heyman suggested that he may refuse the 
artwork saying hes unsure the movement deserves an honor 
in his only public comment on the proposal he wrote in a letter 
to project organizers that those involved in the movement were 
not very good at designing public art to commemorate their own 
actions 
journalism professor david littlejohn derided it as a tribute to 
the unjustified selfassurance of the campus liberal elite 
which he characterizes as ironically intolerant of divergent views 
the free speech movement began oct 1 1964 when student mario 
savio and friend jack weinberg began distributing political 
material on the universitys sproul plaza 
weinberg was arrested and placed in the back of a patrol car 
but hundreds of students surrounded the automobile and for 32 hours 
refused to let 600 police officers take him into custody 
photographs of savio and others addressing the crowd from atop 
the car were published around the world leading to sympathetic 
student strikes until the university dropped its ban several months 
later 
the protests culminated in a december sitin at sproul hall 
where 773 people were taken into custody then the largest mass 
arrest in california history 
i feel theres a lot of pride among students today in the 
students who were here before us said matthew miller an 
architecture student and a member of the committee that selected 
the finalists from 277 applications 
the proposals will be displayed at the university art museum 
through march 3 after which the committee and project organizers 
will announce the winner the public can register their favorite 
with ballots 
at a tuesday news conference committee members including 
internationally known artists said the proposals would be refined 
and possibly modified they reserved the right to combine several 
of the ideas 
charles schwartz a physics professor since 1960 devised the 
idea of the monument last year after finding a recently installed 
campus statue of two black bears which he labeled big fat 
powerful complacent representative of the worst of california 
since then the proposal has receieved support from 100 
professors politicians students and most of the leaders of the 
free speech movement

prime minister margaret thatcher said thursday a 
ban on new investment in south africa should be lifted when 
president fw de klerks government frees imprisoned black leader 
nelson mandela 
she said reforms de klerk announced friday had been welcomed 
internationally and as we agreed both at the last meeting of the 
european community and in the commonwealth it is necessary to have 
encouragement for such steps as well as chastisement for what has 
not yet been done 
we do believe that when mr mandela is released it would be 
advisable to release some of the very minor sanctions in 
particular the voluntary ban on new investment mrs thatcher 
said in the house of commons 
at britains insistence foreign ministers of the 12nation 
european community will review sanctions against south africa at a 
feb 20 meeting in dublin ireland 
diplomatic sources said the netherlands and portugal also want 
to ease restrictions but ireland which holds the rotating 
sixmonth presidency of the community feels no action should be 
taken 
mrs thatcher an opponent of sanctions lifted academic and 
cultural restrictions within minutes of de klerks announcement 
friday among other things he legalized the african national 
congress guerrilla movement and promised mandela would be freed 
soon 
british opposition parties and the antiapartheid movement 
criticized her they feel sanctions should be maintained until 
apartheid is abolished 
some sanctions imposed by britain are mandatory under 
international agreements including a ban on arms exports and the 
import of south african iron steel and krugerrand gold coins 
voluntary measures could be lifted by britain unilaterally or 
after persuading some others to follow suit in the european 
community or the 49nation commonwealth the association of britain 
and its former colonies 
nonbinding measures include bans on investment and tourism 
promotion 
mrs thatcher reacted mildly to the expulsions from south africa 
earlier tuesday of two british journalists who were covering the 
tour of an unofficial english cricket team 
we have told the south african authorities that we regret 
these expulsions she said then noted that south africa said one 
was working illegally on a tourist visa and the other filed a vivid 
account of police breaking up a demonstration he had not witnessed 
before leaving johannesburg paul weaver a sports writer with 
the london newspaper today acknowledged he had not seen the 
demonstration the british news agency press association reported 
but it quoted him as saying 
i saw the bloodstains which remained after the police had used 
dogs and tear gas on demonstrators and i spoke to many people who 
were there at the time 
the other expelled journalist was gareth furby of independent 
radio news whose reports the government in pretoria said were 
intended to damage south africas image

escalating gang violence despite increased 
arrests and prosecutions is forging an alliance between community 
groups and law enforcement participants in a state summit on gangs 
said tuesday 
educators law enforcement authorities and leaders of community 
programs were taking part in a twoday conference to fight gang 
influence in neighborhoods 
state and local law enforcement authorities who have seen death 
tolls rise from gang violence said enlisting people in 
gangplagued neighborhoods may be the only hope in fighting the 
problem 
i dont think that we can any longer assume that by putting 
more and more gang members and drug dealers into jail we are going 
to force them somehow into submission said los angeles police 
cmdr lorne kramer 
communities need to be mobilized we definitely need to 
develop more comprehensive preventative programs 
los angeles county sheriffs department figures show 554 
gangrelated homicides in the county in 1989 exceeding the record 
452 homicides in 1988 
there are an estimated 80000 gang members today in the los 
angeles area up from 30000 in 1980 said steve valdivia 
executive director of the citys antigang agency community youth 
gang services 
the conference which ends wednesday focused on training small 
community organizations to work together and with law enforcement 
in developing and expanding programs to help neighborhoods rid 
themselves of gangs 
youve got to look for some quickfix successes that you can 
take into neighborhoods said natalie salazar executive director 
of los angeles community reclamation project youve got to get 
rid of the graffiti knock down some of the crack houses in the 
area make sure the street lights are fixed make sure the streets 
are swept 
crp is a federally funded pilot program based in the harbor area 
of los angeles an area inhabited for generations by hispanic and 
filipino gangs 
salazar said the yearold program works with schools in 
antigang and antidrug education and sponsors recreational 
activities and citizens meetings with law enforcement agencies 
federal officials hope to expand the program scheduled to end 
in july to other cities and states 
working on a small scale sometimes just a twoblock area the 
program teaches how to cope with such problems as graffiti and 
loitering salazar said 
to combat the factionalism inherent in gang culture the program 
sponsored a basketball tournament that involved 500 junior high 
schoolage youths 
kids from particular neighborhoods often feel they cant go 
into other neighborhoods or learn to hate people from other 
neighborhoods she said the basketball tournament helps form 
bonds with kids from other neighborhoods 
in the los angeles police departments newton division which 
has one of the highest homicide rates of any police precinct in the 
nation a citizens group called 100 men plus has started a private 
initiative against gangs patrolling schools and parks removing 
graffiti and befriending neighborhood youth the group recently 
formed its fourth los angeles chapter 
theres no way we can claim any kind of success because the 
homicides are still there said valdivia whose agency works with 
100 men plus but the signs are there

the citys first black school superintendent 
was reinstated and five black school board members were urged to 
return to their posts tuesday after racial turmoil forced the 
closing of two public schools 
the allwhite selma board of education announced norward 
roussells reinstatement as superintendent and the closing of all 
11 schools in the system wednesday in a compromise aimed at ending 
weeks of protests 
the rev fd reese selma highs black principal who was named 
interim superintendent sunday announced he was resigning so 
roussell could resume his duties 
moments after reeses announcement black protest leaders met 
with mayor joe smitherman to discuss ways of ending weeks of racial 
conflict over the operation of the predominantly black school 
system the 6000student city school system is about 70 percent 
black 
smitherman and black leaders gave no details of the proposed 
compromise but both sides made clear that roussells return would 
be a crucial element in any resolution of the conflict 
the board announced later tuesday that roussell would resume his 
duties and all 11 schools in the system would be closed wednesday 
due to recent disturbances and turmoil which have prevented 
normal operation of our school system 
selma city schools will reopen upon adequate assurances to dr 
roussell and the board that the safety and physical welfare of our 
students and all school employees can be ensured the school 
board said in a statement 
the board has been made up of six whites since the five black 
members announced they were resigning following a vote along 
racial lines in december against extending roussells contract 
beyond its june expiration date 
the five later said they had not signed any official resignation 
papers leaving open their return 
mostly black selma high school with 1508 students and almost 
allblack eastside middle school with 407 students closed tuesday 
as racial tensions rose following the arrest of four black leaders 
in a melee at smithermans city hall office the day before 
reese said there were instances of racial fighting at selma high 
school and called for the orderly dismissal of students from the 
citys only public high school because we could certainly see and 
feel the level of tensions among the students 
police were called to the school but smitherman said no arrests 
were made 
dozens of the black students joined in a series of 
demonstrations outside city hall on tuesday with adults they 
carried signs saying smitherman must go sang songs of the 
civil rights movement and called for roussells reinstatement 
roussell was at selma high school as throngs of parents and 
students left the building he joined in helping disperse crowds of 
students so we would not have any trouble 
protesters have charged roussell was dismissed because he is 
black an allegation denied by white school board members they 
cited an unfavorable job evaluation and roussells management style 
as the reason for his firing 
last week the remaining white board members decided to remove 
roussell from his 80000ayear job immediately and on sunday 
installed reese as interim superintendent

firefighters tuesday raced to save 
about 250 nearextinct golden lion marmosets from a forest fire 
that has ravaged a wildlife reserve for rare animals in 
southeastern brazil officials said 
more than 200 firefighters police and biologists were unable to 
halt the fire which started saturday in the poco das antas 
wildlife reserve 80 miles northeast of rio said reserve director 
dionizio pessamilio 
pessamilio said the fire had burned about half the 12300acre 
reserve the last remaining natural habitat for the marmoset and a 
sanctuary for rare sloths alligators and jaguars 
the situation is bad he said in a televised interview 
the dense forest where the tamarins live is now burning 
worsening their chances of survival 
tamarin is another name for the marmoset a monkey the size of a 
cat with a lionlike mane and a bushy tail 
pessamilio said biologists had already lost contact with several 
of the creatures which are monitored by means of tiny radio 
transmitters tied around their necks 
environmentalists are concerned the fire may kill all of the shy 
animals because they hide in tree holes for warmth and shelter 
high wind difficult access to the mountainous area and a lack 
of water caused by a long dry spell hampered firefighters efforts 
pessamilio said 
only several days of heavy rain would put out the fire he said 
rain was not forecast for the region until friday 
globo tv the nations largest network showed helicopters 
airlifting firefighters to burning areas and crews battling flames 
with portable water tanks and rubber mats 
fernando mesquita president of the brazilian institute of the 
environment and renewable resources said more firefighters would 
join the effort and work aroundtheclock 
the cause of the fire was not known but officials said 
unusually dry weather and 100degree summer temperatures could have 
caused the fire to begin spontaneously 
poco das antas has become the center of an international crusade 
to protect the environment 
the reserve was founded in 1974 and funded by the smithsonian 
institution in washington the world wildlife fund and the 
brazilian and canadian environmental groups 
the marmoset first faced extinction in 1972 when just 70 
remained on earth after poachers hunters and ranchers trapped them 
and cut down their forest habitats 
but the animal slowly had been reproducing after naturalists 
released them in groups from foreign zoos into the brazilian forest

interim president ion iliescu 
registered the former ruling national salvation front on tuesday to 
run in the may 20 elections and a top aide said iliescu will be 
its presidential candidate 
the front unelected and ruling by decree since longtime 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was toppled and executed in 
december is considered the frontrunner in the race against 29 
political parties 
our candidate for president will be mr iliescu thats for 
sure thats what everyone wants said dan radulescu chief of 
the fronts commission for press and public relations 
interim prime minister petre roman said in an interview for us 
television that he too wanted iliescu a former communist official 
who fell out with ceausescu to run for president 
i hope it will be iliescu he said in the interview for john 
mclaughlins syndicated one on one program which will be 
broadcast in the united states next weekend a transcript was made 
available here 
roman said he would not campaign to be prime minister but would 
probably accept the post if the front wins the election and he is 
asked by a majority of the movement 
the front on jan 23 reversed its pledge to stay out of the 
election it has refused to become a political party choosing 
instead to remain a political movement 
iliescu went to the central tribunal to officially register the 
front which has split from the government and the eightmember 
ruling council 
the front agreed to form a council of national unity with 
opposition parties to run the country until romanias first 
multiparty elections since world war ii are held in may the new 
national unity council will meet for the first time friday 
in its platform released tuesday the front said its aim is 
realization in romania of a democratic society based on political 
pluralism the separation of powers in the state the assurance of 
liberty and human dignity 
the front said it also sought to guarantee the inviolability 
of human rights the respecting of the rights and liberties of all 
national minorities the guarantee of freedom of religion 
another platform goal is creation of a modern national 
economy based on efficiency and individual as well as collective 
initiative 
roman said romania was moving slowly toward a market economy and 
faced two major economic problems that it produced only basic 
products and that its largest industries had far greater capacity 
than the country needs 
the platform included membership guidelines and an outline of 
the partys structure from villages on up it bars from membership 
anyone convicted of crimes against the revolution 
the platform made no mention of the communist party last month 
the front announced it would outlaw the party then it decided to 
submit the question to a referendum only to cancel the vote a 
short time later 
asked in the interview whether the communist party was dead for 
all practical purposes roman replied the communist party 
doesnt exist any more practically it was a selfdissolution 
he said the front and every political party had former 
communists as members 
sources in the front speaking on condition of anonymity 
meanwhile said tourism minister mihai lupoi had resigned radulescu 
said he could not confirm the resignation 
on tuesday night roman acceded to cadet demands that romanias 
only merchant marine academy the mircea cel batrin institute be 
demilitarized 
he signed an agreement transferring authority over the institute 
from the defense ministry to the ministry of education 
representatives of the 1265 cadets expressed skepticism that 
the defense ministry would cooperate more than 200 cadets who 
began a hunger strike tuesday morning said they would continue 
through the night

the three major republican fundraising 
committees reaped more than 80 million in 1989 and entered this 
election year with more than 14 million on hand nearly triple the 
combined war chest of their democratic counterparts the federal 
election commission said tuesday 
the democratic national committee and the partys separate house 
and senate campaign arms raised and spent more than 19 million in 
1989 and carried over 54 million to this year 
last year was an unusually costly off year because of eight 
special congressional elections but while they spent considerable 
amounts on those races the national parties focused much of their 
resources on building stronger fundraising machinery for this year 
the performance of the democratic groups while an improvement 
over past nonfederal election years was again dwarfed by that of 
the gops money machines but tempering the republican edge is the 
fact that more democrats who hold a majority in both chambers of 
congress enjoy the lopsided donor preference for giving to the 
individual campaign coffers of incumbents thus republicans with 
more challengers than incumbents are more reliant on national 
party support 
the fec data showed that the three republican committees spent 
722 million of the 804 million they took in last year 
but because of cash left over from 1988 the gop groups entered 
this year already armed with 144 million the overwhelming bulk 
of that money 106 million was in the coffers of the national 
republican senatorial committee which is hoping to erode the 
democratic majority in that chamber this year as part of a strategy 
aimed at recapturing the senate in the 1992 presidential elections 
the gop senate committee which raised 354 million and spent 
27 million reported 589734 in debts as of jan 31 about half 
its 11 million debt at the end of 1987 the last comparable 
nonelection year 
the national republican congressional committee the gops main 
fundraising arm for house candidates raised 142 million and 
spent 131 million according to its yearend filing with the fec 
the nrcc had 23 million heading into this year and debts of 
794654 up dramatically from the 34922 in red ink it reported 
two years ago 
the republican national committee meanwhile reported receiving 
306 million in 1989 and spending 31 million because of its 1988 
reserves it carried over 15 million into this year while 
reporting no debt according to the fec 
on the democratic side the democratic national committee and 
the democratic senatorial campaign committee reported significant 
strides last year in reducing debts but the partys cashpoor 
democratic congressional campaign committee nearly doubled its debt 
from two years ago and entered this year with just 22179 on hand 
the dccc said it raised 41 million last year and spent 42 
million its reported debts grew from 828889 at the end of 1987 
to 16 million as of jan 31 the 22179 it had on hand entering 
the year was less than onetenth of the nearly 233000 it held at 
the beginning of 1988 
far more impressive was the fundraising of the democratic 
senate committee which said it collected 8 million in 
contributions and other receipts and spent 6 million the 
democrats senate campaign operation had nearly 16 million in the 
bank as the year began and had sliced the 1 million debt it 
reported two years ago down to 319201 
the democratic national committee meanwhile reported receipts 
of 68 million and said it drew on 1988 reserves in spending 84 
million last year those reserves comparatively deep for the 
democratic party allowed it to enter the year with 38 million on 
hand up dramatically from the 722288 the party coffers held at 
the end of 1987 
the dnc also reported debts of 111837 at the end of last year 
down from more than 16 million in red ink reported in its 
yearend filing two years ago 
we feel very good about it and look forward to a very good 
1990 dnc treasurer robert farmer said adding the dnc hoped to 
raise at least 10 million he said national party groups will face 
competition for money because of 36 gubernatorial elections and 
other state races vital to the outcome of congressional 
redistricting 
for all of the committees the totals raised include 
contributions and other receipts such as interest on bank accounts 
and certificates of deposit 
separate fec data on the special elections last year show that 
nearly 11 million was spent on the eight races there were 41 
initial candidates in the eight elections with the 16 who survived 
to participate in the final headtohead contests accounting for 
89 million of the spending total 
the national parties and their state affiliates invested heavily 
in those races with total expenditures by the major parties 
reaching neatly 12 million

gen michel aouns soldiers drove rival 
militiamen from a northern suburb tuesday and turned their guns on 
a surrounded garrison in an intrachristian war that has cost 
hundreds of lives in eight days 
beiruts largest christian hospital said its morgue had 
overflowed and the bodies would have to be buried in a mass grave 
voice of lebanon a christian radio station said said thousands 
of people were going hungry in bomb shelters made cold and dank 
because of heavy rain and a power failure caused when shellfire 
knocked out the main power station 
police said 38 people were killed and 111 wounded tuesday that 
raised casualties to 315 killed and 1148 wounded since the battle 
for christian supremacy began jan 30 between aouns men and the 
lebanese forces militia led by samir geagea 
president elias hrawi appealed to the superpowers vatican 
european governments the united nations and arab leaders for help 
in ending the fighting 
i appeal for your support in any effort or endeavor i might 
find myself compelled to take to end the plight of the lebanese 
people and salvage lebanon he said in telegrams to president 
bush mikhail s gorbachev pope john paul ii and other leaders 
arab leaders receiving the telegram included president hafez 
assad of syria who keeps 40000 soldiers and 300 tanks in lebanon 
and supports hrawi whom parliament elected in november as part of 
a peace plan designed to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
aouns television station reported that papal nuncio pablo 
puentes delivered a message from the pope to aoun but gave no 
details except to say that it concerned the fighting in the 
christian enclave 
hrawi dismissed aoun as military chief but the general who 
rejects the peace plan and does not recognize the president has 
refused to relinquish his command 
on tuesday hrawi called aoun a mutineer against legitimacy 
and blamed him for the latest carnage 
his statement was seen as a threat to intervene militarily he 
would have to call on the syrians for that because the 22000 
moslem troops loyal to him are poorly trained and equipped 
syrian troops fought a sixmonth war last year with aoun who 
calls them an army of occupation it ended when the arab league 
arranged a ceasefire in september 
during a visit to syria by hrawi last month assad publicly 
pledged to help him crush the general 
after the lebanese forces abandoned the strategic suburb of 
dbaye on tuesday aouns gunners trained their artillery on a 
surrounded militia garrison in christian east beirut the militia 
which said dbaye was destroyed by hysterical shelling 
responded by shelling areas controlled by aoun 
the hotel dieu hospital in the ashrafiyeh district of east 
beirut said its morgue was full and the bodies were decomposing 
because of the power failure 
we find ourselves obliged to bury the victims in a mass grave 
in ashrafiyeh wednesday if no one shows up to collect them it 
said in a statement broadcast by voice of lebanon 
a moslem station voice of the nation said those who would 
emerge from shelters to collect the bodies would end up dead 
french official bernard kouchner met with hrawi and prime 
minister salim hoss about helping residents of the 310mile enclave 
north and east of beirut where 1 million christians live 
kouchner organized an evacuation of wounded lebanese civilians 
to a french hospital ship in april 1989 he said a french plane 
with about 150 seats for sitting wounded landed early in the 
day at beirut airport in the moslem western sector 
a spokesman for the health ministry which is helping coordinate 
kouchners mission said word had been sent to the warring 
factions but no practical responses have been received to help get 
the mercy mission going 
lebanon became a french mandate after world war i and gained 
independence in 1943 
aouns command said it had crushed the last pockets of 
resistance in dbaye and cut off militiamen north of the suburb 
from besieged lebanese forces strongholds in east beirut aoun 
commands nearly 20000 men and geagea has 6000 militia regulars 
with an estimated 30000 reservists 
the lebanese forces said its men redeployed along the northern 
entrance of the 300yard dog river tunnel north of dbaye police 
reported that aouns tanks chased the militiamen to the edge of the 
dog river valley 
other tank units hammered the militias besieged kassardjian 
garrison in the east beirut district of ein rummaneh all day 
tuesday in apparent preparation to storm it police reported 
according to aouns command all escape routes from 
kassardjian were sealed the garrison backs up on the hostile 
shiite moslem district of shiyah across the capitals sectarian 
dividing line 
gunners loyal to the general pounded the militiacontrolled 
residential districts of ashrafiyeh jemmayezeh and karantina with 
usmade 155mm howitzers 
police said militia gunners replied with sovietdesigned 122mm 
rockets fired at the sin elfil furn elshubbak hazmiyeh and 
fayadiyeh districts held by aoun and at the baabda suburb where 
he has a headquarters bunker beneath lebanons shattered

a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that 
mississippis public universities are insufficiently desegregated 
overruling a lower court judge 
in its 21 decision the 5th us circuit court of appeals said 
that with few exceptions the states five historically white and 
three historically black universities remain virtually as 
segregated as they were when black citizens sued the state in 
january 1975 
in their majority opinion judges irving goldberg and sam d 
johnson said there were many steps but no discernible degrees of 
progress unfortunately this case lingered loitered and lulled 
for more than a decade 
the court sent the case back to us district judge neal b 
biggers jr who had dismissed the lawsuit after declaring 
mississippis university system sufficiently desegregated 
most state and university officials could not be reached 
immediately for comment and those who could were guarded in their 
comments 
i have learned about this decision secondhand i have not seen 
any legal documents im quite sure our attorneys will be briefing 
us soon said aubrey lucas president of the university of 
southern mississippi 
the appellate court ordered further proceedings involving a 
broader cast of characters 
psychologists sociologists economists engineers doctors 
and professionals from all relevant areas of learning play a 
role said the majority opinion 
windows must open to ventilate the courtroom with ideas from 
the winds of truth it said to this end testimony 
depositions crossexaminations and opinions can assist only then 
should the parties come forth with a definite plan for achieving 
desegregation 
in a dissent judge john duhe said mississippi had fulfilled its 
legal obligation to open its universities to all students 
regardless of race 
the majority relying on district and other circuit court 
decisions has imposed upon the state the same constitutional 
duty required for primary and secondary education where freedom of 
choice is unavailable and services are free of charge 
in doing so wrote duhe it takes a liberty that is simply 
not available to courts of appeals 
in its review the 5th circuit said racial imbalances of 
students faculty undergraduate and graduate programs 
appropriations and admissions policies among other things have 
continued since the court ordered the university of mississippi to 
enroll james meredith its first black student in 1962 
to this day the majority said historically white delta state 
university mississippi state university mississippi university 
for women the university of mississippi and the university of 
southern mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over historically 
black alcorn state jackson state and mississippi valley state 
universities 
standardized college admissions examinations as administered by 
mississippi also discriminate the court said and the board of 
trustees of state institutions of higher learning spent more money 
on educating students at mostly white institutions than they did on 
students at black schools 
for instance the court said the state spent an average 1351 
in 1960 and 8516 in 1986 on each student enrolled at historically 
white institutions the average at historically black schools was 
718 in 1960 and 6038 in 1986 the court said 
the badge of inferiority that marks black institutions has not 
been removed goldberg and johnson wrote as such there 
remains in mississippis higher educational system vestiges of 
discrimination which distort the perceptions of black students 
vestiges of de jure segregation permeate the public university 
system of mississippi admissions policies the racial composition 
of the faculty and administration funding practices academic 
offerings and mission designations all perpetuate a stigma of 
inferiority

jurors in the assault and conspiracy trial of 
reputed mob boss john gotti concluded their first day of 
deliberations tuesday after listening again to 11 tapes that are 
the prosecutions key evidence 
the jury retired at about 715 pm and was to resume 
deliberations wednesday morning 
law enforcement officers secretly recorded a dozen tapes of 
conversations at gottis hangout in the borough of queens and in 
the visiting room of a jail 
among the conversations jurors heard again were one in which 
gotti allegedly says were gonna gonna bust him up which the 
prosecution says is a reference to a former union leader and 
another in which members of the westies gang allegedly say they 
shot the man as a favor to gotti 
the defense has ridiculed the tapes as inaudible and claims 
prosecutors transcribed them to suit their theory that gotti had 
john f oconnor shot 
as the jury began deliberations earlier in the day acting 
justice edward mclaughlin told the four alternate jurors they would 
be held in court custody and he could not tell them why 
a court source said the alternates were being held at least 
until tomorrow and maybe longer to minimize chances of their 
being found and bothered for information about the 12 main jurors 
since their swearingin about three weeks ago all the jurors 
have been sequestered to shield them from publicity and possible 
jurytampering court officials estimate it costs 1200 a day to 
feed house and transport them 
about two hours after getting the case the jurors sent a note 
requesting a rereading of the definition of firstdegree 
intentional assault the first count on their verdict sheet they 
then began rehearing the tapes 
gotti 49 and his codefendant anthony tony lee guerrieri 
61 are accused of commissioning the westies a gang from 
manhattans hells kitchen district to shoot oconnor former vice 
president of carpenters union local 608 on may 7 1986 oconnor 
was shot in the buttocks and survived 
assistant district attorney michael cherkasky said gotti 
alleged boss of the gambino crime family arranged the shooting 
because oconnor ordered goons to trash bankers and brokers a 
mobrun restaurant in lower manhattan that was being built with 
nonunion labor 
the judge told the jurors that to convict they must find the 
prosecution proved the specific elements of the crime charged in 
the trial and not simply that gotti and his codefendant might be 
members of organized crime 
he also reminded them that the prosecutions key witness former 
westies member and confessed killer james mcelroy 45 testified he 
had previously lied under oath the judge told the jurors it was up 
to them to decide whether they believe mcelroy was testifying 
truthfully against gotti 
just before the jurors left to deliberate mclaughlin admonished 
them 
the person that you were when you left your apartment those 
weeks ago is the person youre supposed to be in the jury room 
he said do not become somebody else dont turn the jury room 
into the twilight zone dont expect divine intervention 
you do not have to answer to anybody but yourselves regarding 
the verdict mclaughlin said if you can look at yourself in 
the mirror every day for the rest of your life and say i 
conscientiously followed the law and called it as i saw it then 
whatever your verdict turns out to be it will have been the 
correct one 
in closing arguments monday defense lawyers bruce cutler and 
gerald shargel said gotti was being persecuted because of his 
reputation 
when the smoke clears you will realize one thing that there 
is no proof let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt that john 
gotti and anthony guerrieri had john oconnor shot shargel said 
the judge told the jurors the charges they are to consider 
intentional first and seconddegree assault reckless first and 
seconddegree assault fourthdegree conspiracy a felony and 
fifthdegree conspiracy a misdemeanor 
if convicted gotti could face 25 years to life in prison as a 
persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and 1974

a food and drug administration survey that 
found the nations milk supply to be free of veterinary drug 
residues was attacked tuesday in a congressional hearing 
the challenges to the fda survey of milk in 14 cities came from 
rep ted weiss chairman of the house government operations 
subcommittee on government and human resources and fda scientist 
joseph settepani 
too many government officials seem to think their overriding 
responsibility is to reassure the public that the milk supply is 
safe even when it may not be said weiss dny alleging that 
fda is more concerned with public relations than science 
the fda released a study monday that contradicted findings of 
two surveys by the wall street journal and an advocacy group the 
center for science in the public interest as well as findings of 
its own 
both private tests were done using a relatively new test known 
as the charm 2 the test is highly sensitive able to test drug 
residues in amounts as low as five parts per billion its advocates 
say 
but the fda said the test yields too many false positives and 
none of its positive findings could be validated in what it 
considered to be better even newer tests the charm 2 test is 
limited also because it detects only classes of drugs not 
individual drugs within a class fda says 
the fda said that using charm 2 it found a variety of drugs in 
36 out of 70 samples of those 14 contained sulfa drugs 
those 14 were tested by high pressure liquid chromatography 
which found sulfa drugs in 11 samples that test was sensitive to 
at least 10 parts per billion 
the test has been accepted by federal regulators for detecting 
only a single drug sulfamethazine and not for the purpose it was 
used in the newest test according to fda testimony 
the 11 samples were further tested by mass spectrometry and 
none was found to be positive for individual sulfa drugs the test 
is capable of isolating specific drugs but it is less sensitive 
than charm 2 able only to detect amounts of 20 parts per billion 
six of 11 samples were below 20 parts per billion by the other 
tests 
there is just no way to believe that mass spectrometry which 
is sensitive to only about 20 parts per billion could have picked 
those up even by your expectations weiss said 
settepani who testified with the fda panel and earlier with a 
member of the consumer group complained that fda had earlier tried 
to discredit tests that find potentially dangerous residues in milk 
the initial reaction to each new report of residues in milk 
has been attempts to discredit the assay used to obtain the 
reported results he said 
he said a 1988 internal memorandum listed 30 drugs believed to 
be used by milk producers 16 of them extensively but current 
standard tests used by state inspectors can only detect two he 
said

a federal appeals judge hearing oliver norths 
irancontra case tuesday questioned why north wasnt allowed to 
call former president reagan as a defense witness at his trial 
during nearly 2 hours of arguments us court of appeals judge 
laurence silberman noted that reagans written answers to questions 
in the irancontra affair were submitted to a grand jury but were 
never provided to norths lawyers 
silberman one of three judges who will rule on norths appeal 
of his conviction on three felony counts asked why as a matter 
of basic fairness reagans written answers werent turned over to 
the defendant 
government attorney gerard lynch said the judgment was made that 
reagans written answers would not have been helpful to north 
and so werent turned over 
but our system is based on giving someone accused of a 
crime wide latitude in obtaining information for his defense 
responded silberman 
the appeals court panel consists of silberman and david 
sentelle both reagan administration appointees and carter 
administration appointee patricia wald chief judge of the appeals 
court 
silberman also questioned whether the case against north was 
tainted by his own immunized testimony to congress in 1987 another 
basis on which north is urging that his convictions be reversed 
senior reagan administration officials testified at norths 
trial after being drenched in the immunized testimony he gave 
on national television said silberman you have a prima facie 
violation of the requirement that no part of a case be derived 
from a defendants immunized testimony 
but lynch said norths lawyers are incorrectly equating 
exposure with taint and use and that the prosecution was based 
on independent recollection of all witnesses 
indicating that reagans written answers in the irancontra 
inquiry may have been more general than specific silberman said 
that what troubles me is we dont have a very good idea of what 
reagan might have said as a defense witness for north 
if north had worked in the state department and reagan had been 
secretary of state there would have been no question that he would 
have been called to testify said silberman 
north who was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction 
of congress altering and destroying national security council 
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity argued that all his 
activities were approved by his superiors national security 
adviser john poindexter and reagan 
silberman also questioned whether poindexters videotaped 
testimony on capitol hill should have been admitted as evidence at 
the north trial 
only two people were north of north the president and 
admiral poindexter said silberman 
lynch emphasized that norths own testimony was that he 
never met alone with reagan and that north never said the 
president told him to do anything 
silberman said that even if reagan didnt specifically authorize 
the actions for which north was convicted of crimes the 
expresidents testimony might have been helpful to north 
suppose the expresident says that i never gave specific 
authorization but i did indicate that i didnt wish this 
information to be revealed said silberman 
defense attorney barry simon said reagan should have been called 
to confirm that he authorized keeping secret from congress the us 
connection to a november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles from israel 
to iran 
lynch conceded that north may have gotten the impression 
from poindexter that the us role was to be kept secret but lynch 
argued that north knew he was committing a wrongful act when he 
obstructed congress from learning of the issue 
were not talking about keeping secrets from enemies of the 
united states or even the public said lynch 
at norths trial us district court judge gerhard gesell 
quashed a subpoena for reagans appearance the judge ruled there 
was no evidence in the record to suggest that the former president 
authorized any illegal activities by north 
gesell also rejected a request to admit as evidence portions of 
poindexters congressional testimony on videotaped segments which 
were prepared by norths trial team 
gesell on july 5 placed north on probation for two years fined 
him 150000 and sentenced him to 1200 hours of community service 
north is performing the community service while appealing the 
convictions and fine

the senate tuesday defeated an attempt to 
strip federal funds from a national school teacher certification 
board setting the stage for passage of a nearly 15 billion 
educational improvement bill 
by a 6435 vote lawmakers turned back an attempt by sen jesse 
helms rnc and others to strike from the excellence in 
education act a provision giving federal money to the panel 
critics argued that it would give the federal government too great 
a say in setting teacher standards 
supporters of the provision tacked onto sweeping education 
legislation president bush sent to capitol hill in april 1989 said 
a wellfinanced board would give badly needed prestige to the 
teaching profession it would bestow the kind of credential review 
that doctors lawyers and others now get they said 
the national board for professional teaching standards was 
created in 1987 at the urging of the national governors 
association it is an independent nonpartisan organization 
governed by a 64member board of directors including 
representatives of teachers unions activities so far have been 
lowkey 
the senate is considering a wideranging education bill which 
among other things seeks to combat drugs in public schools 
establish a presidential merit schools program and increase aid to 
schools seeking to lower dropout rates the senate planned a vote 
wednesday on the overall bill 
according to congressional budget office estimates the bill 
cost nearly 15 billion over the next five years 
earlier tuesday the senate passed 990 legislation that would 
provide 50 million in the next fiscal year to attack illiteracy 
said to affect at least 23 million americans with a goal of 
eliminating illiteracy by the year 2000 
helms argued that activities of the teaching standards board 
would be dominated by these unions the national education 
association and the american federation of teachers 
what this board wants is for it to be the sole voice of 
setting the standards by which teachers operate that only 
teachers and their unions should decide who can and who cannot 
teach helms argued now i think thats an outrage 
the control of these unions over the board will enable them to 
use taxpayers money not so much to professionalize teachers as to 
finalize who does and does not teach in america he said 
sen trent lott rmiss said a vote against the bill was a 
vote for parents 
sen edward m kennedy dmass charged that misinformation 
was being spread about the board he and other supporters noted 
that none of the 25 million could be used to pay the boards 
operating expenses that the panel would have to raise those funds 
through private means 
sen sam nunn dga said this board represents a unique 
opportunity to improve education 
i think one thing everyone can agree on is that our 
educational system has serious deficiencies he said and it is 
adversely affecting our competitive position in the world 
bush had proposed a 25 million authorization for federal grants 
to states to improve teacher certification that was changed in the 
senate labor and human resources committee the money would be used 
instead by the national board for research and development of a 
national certification program under which teachers could 
voluntarily seek review of their qualifications

the driver of the tour bus that was attacked 
by masked gunmen leaving nine israeli tourists dead has been 
detained on suspicion he collaborated in the assault newspapers 
reported wednesday 
alahram newspaper said police evidence indicated the attack 
sunday was planned abroad and carried out by three gunmen in 
addition to the bus driver earlier reports spoke of two gunmen 
alahram quoted police sources as saying the guns grenades and 
ammunition used in the attack were smuggled into egypt from another 
country 
the nine were killed when the assailants opened fire with 
machine guns and tossed hand grenades on a desert road between 
cairo and the suez canal city of ismailiya twenty people were 
injured including an egyptian tour guide 
the incident has shocked israelis and provoked rightwing calls 
to exclude egypt from the peace process it remains unclear who 
carried out the attack three arab groups have claimed 
responsibility 
alahram reported that bus driver saeed abdelraouf a 
palestinian was detained after witnesses said he stopped the bus 
immediately after the attackers signaled him to do so 
abdelraouf who was said to have gained egyptian nationality 
some time ago said in an interview televised monday night that he 
was taken by surprise and that he stopped the bus after he heard a 
bang that he thought came from a tire explosion 
reports by other government newspapers said the man who rented 
the attack car is a 34yearold palestinian with a jordanian 
passport named akram deeb ihab 
ihab came to egypt jan 21 and left the country a week later 
the daily alakhbar reported 
alahram said about 60 suspects mostly palestinians and an 
unspecified number of egyptian noncommissioned police officers on 
board the tour bus were detained for questioning 
police sources who demanded anonymity said those detained 
included a palestinian believed connected with the ambush but not 
as a gunman 
the noncommissioned officers boarded the bus from rafeh a 
divided city on the border with israel in the sinai peninsula and 
left the bus when ordered to do so by the attackers alahram said 
a senior police official maj gen bahaa eldin ibrahim denied 
a report monday by the staterun middle east news agency tuesday 
that one gunman had been arrested 
a spokesman at the interior ministry which is responsible for 
internal security refused to discuss the newspaper reports 
newspapers reported tuesday that police had found the passport 
of a palestinian they believe was involved in an attack and that 
authorities were searching for two palestinians with jordanian 
passports alahram said police suspect the passports are forged 
newspapers identified the palestinian whose passport was found 
as akram shihab 25 they said he and another man arrived in egypt 
on jan 21 and rented a furnished apartment at shibin elkanatir a 
nile river delta town just north of cairo 
a senior jordanian official in amman said shihab the user of 
the seized passport is not a jordanian but was from rafah 
refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip 
israel has occupied the gaza strip since the 1967 middle east 
war many gaza palestinians carry jordanian passports but jordan 
does not consider them citizens 
alakhbar carried a statement attributed to ahmed jebrils 
popular front for the liberation of palestiniangeneral command 
claiming responsibility for the attack 
it said the claim was broadcast tuesday over libyas tripoli 
radio but monitors in london said they heard no such statement the 
official libyan news agency did not carry the claim 
two arab groups have claimed responsibility for the bus attack 
one in cairo sunday night was made by an anonymous caller to a 
western news agency who said he spoke for the previously unknown 
organization for the defense of the oppressed in egyptian prisons 
in jordan a handwritten message sent monday to the french news 
agency agence francepresse claimed the assault for an obscure 
group calling itself islamic jihadbeit almaqdis arabic for holy 
warjerusalem

a federal judge on tuesday threw out arizonas 
voterapproved measure making english the states official 
language saying it violated the us constitutions first 
amendment 
us district judge paul rosenblatt said in a 20page decision 
that the measure was substantially overbroad 
rosenblatt ruled on a lawsuit by mariakelly yniguez a state 
department of administration worker and state sen jaime gutierrez 
ms yniguez who evaluates and arbitrates medical malpractice 
claims said the law inhibited her constitutional right to free 
speech and threatened her job if she used spanish while speaking 
with a coworker 
gutierrez a tucson democrat who represents a partially hispanic 
district said the law could block him from communicating 
effectively with constituents 
rosenblatt dismissed gutierrez from the case but said yniguez 
was justified in her concerns 
the arizona initiative approved by a 580830to569993 vote in 
the states 1988 general election changed arizonas constitution 
to designate english as the states official language and impose 
sharp limits on use of other languages in state or local government 
affairs 
i thought it was a longshot gutierrez said of the ruling 
it took a lot of courage on the part of the judge i hope the 
decision can be used nationwide but well just fight the battles 
one at a time 
democratic gov rose mofford the only person with legal 
standing to appeal the decision said she was happy the courts 
ruled it unconstitutional and considered the law flawed 
moffords press secretary vada manager said the governor would 
not appeal the ruling 
but the measures backers said mrs mofford should appeal the 
decision especially because a state court had upheld the measures 
constitutionality last year and since similar laws in 16 other 
states had been allowed to stand 
its a surprise and a disappointment said bob park head of 
arizonans for official english federal courts have upheld 
english language amendments wherever they have been challenged i 
am quite confident we would win an appeal

secretary of state james a baker 
iii trying to guide the drive to german reunification registered 
his support tuesday for a plan that would keep the country in nato 
but bar western troops from moving into what is now east germany 
the proposal advanced by west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher last week also would allow soviet troops to 
remain in the eastern region at least at the outset 
a senior us official familiar with bakers thinking said the 
move to reunification had accelerated to the point that the two 
germanies are likely to begin a process of economic political and 
legal integration after east germany holds national elections march 
18 
the process of unification is taking place on the ground right 
now and will continue to take place at a quick pace said the 
senior official traveling aboard bakers plane and commenting only 
on condition he not be named 
later in a speech scheduled for delivery wednesday at charles 
university baker proposed that the united states canada the 
soviet union and 32 european nations send observer delegations to 
eastern and central europe to ensure that the emerging democracies 
hold elections that genuinely represent their people 
in his text baker also voiced support for soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs call for a summit of the 35 nations later in 
the year and proposed it establish free elections as a human right 
he said the soviet leadership apparently had agreed that 
legitimacy not force is the only way to ensure european 
stability 
baker has publicly lent support to the general idea of german 
reunification without committing himself to any specific approach 
he has stressed only that the country be in the north atlantic 
treaty organization and that it evolve in a peaceful stepbystep 
way 
his support for the genscher plan therefore could be 
significant soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze with 
whom baker will open four days of talks in moscow on wednesday 
night has called for an international referendum while expressing 
concern over the revival of sinister shadows of the past 
bakers visit to prague coincided with a visit by east german 
premier hans modrow for talks with czech premier marian calfa 
there has been speculation but no confirmation that baker and 
modrow might meet 
modrow told reporters in a noquestions briefing that he ahd 
calfa agreed that german reunification should only be completed 
in a process which respects and preserves the interests of 
neighbors and european states 
baker discussed the situation with french foreign minister 
roland dumas during a refueling stop in shannon ireland and then 
flew here for talks with leaders of czechoslovakias velvet 
revolution 
baker met with vaclav havel the dissident playwright who was 
elevated to the presidency with the disintegration of the communist 
party in december and separately with roman catholic cardinal 
frantisek tomasek and leaders of the civic forum the prodemocracy 
group that toppled the hardliners 
baker told reporters that he had a very productive 
discussion with havel about troop and weapon reductions in europe 
and that it would be resumed when havel visits washington in two 
weeks 
he announced a series of moves by the bush administration to 
assist czechoslovakias economy including the dismantling of us 
trade barriers provided laws are enacted permitting free 
elections and support for czechoslovakias entry into the 
international monetary fund the us exportimport bank 
but he cautioned the prague government that it is up to you to 
provide a conducive legal environment to turn over or sell 
factories to private owners and to lift the heavy hand of 
excessive government intervention 
he brought an offer of technical advice to assist the countrys 
adoption of a free market system and other capitalistic wrappings 
that are enticing american businesses but he brought no aid 
they do not want a handout said a us official who briefed 
reporters on condition of anonymity 
here as elsewhere in europe attention is riveted on germany 
and the future of american and soviet troops 
havel has demanded the withdrawal of the estimated 75000 soviet 
soldiers in czechoslovakia his plans for disarmament could be an 
impetus for further us cuts beyond the 100000 or so that would 
be withdrawn under president bushs latest proposal 
but a us official said there are many statements by havel 
and others in czechoslovakia who recognize an important us role 
in political economic and security terms 
baker and dumas in their 90minute meeting in ireland both 
recognized that unification is moving ahead very quickly the 
senior us official said they thought that all things 
considered that its actually moving along in a pretty effective 
fashion 
while the french foreign minister did not specifically endorse 
the genscher plan the official said from the tone of it it was 
very positive moreover the official said the 16member nato 
alliance is moving toward a consensus in support of the plan 
genscher discussed it with baker at the state department last 
friday night and it is bound to be a major item in the agenda for 
bakers talks with shevardnadze and with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
genscher has come up with one proposal and we think that the 
proposal in terms of not having nato forces move further east is a 
pretty good one the official said 
also he stressed it would keep the new and larger germany in 
nato a move that is designed to reassure other european countries 
who have suffered in two devastating wars this century

the republic of moldavia secedes from 
the soviet union and becomes part of neighboring romania for a 
growing number of native moldavians it would be going home 
moldavia was romanian until stalin seized it 50 years ago 
theres nothing unnatural in our peoples desire to reunify 
said leonida lari a poet who represents moldavia in the soviet 
congress of peoples deputies in moscow we are as romanian as 
those living across the border 
romanias revolution against nicolae ceausescu has awakened a 
passion among native moldavians for reunification and it has grown 
so intense that even the republics leaders may find it difficult 
to control 
leaders on both sides of the prut river border mindful of the 
dangers for romania as it rebuilds and the soviet union as it 
lurches from one ethnic crisis to another say the future 
relationship between romania and the territory josef stalin 
attached to his empire in 1940 need not be decided now 
but the first calls of unire unity echoed through this 
moldavian capital at the start of the romanian revolt in december 
moldavians speak a nearly identical language as romanians and 
admire the same cultural heroes 
but during their history they often have been separated before 
the breakup of czarist russia in 1917 moldavia was the russian 
province of bessarabia many russians ukrainians and jews have 
lived in moldavia for generations 
inspired by the romanian revolution thousands of moldavians 
took to the streets in a show of support for the anticeausescu 
forces some young people offered to cross the border to join the 
battle the republics government as well as the moldavian 
peoples front movement sent medicine and food 
the peoples front already had been pressing demands on moscow 
for greater autonomy it won a battle to establish moldavian as the 
official language of the republic and returned to the latin 
alphabet used by romanians dropping the cyrillic letters imposed 
under stalin 
the peoples front has drawn thousands into the streets of 
kishinev for rallies and even its opponents acknowledge it is 
likely to sweep local elections this spring 
in the wake of the revolution peoples front leaders still 
treat the issue of reunification cautiously mindful of dangers for 
themselves as well as for president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
today we are not putting the issue of reunification among the 
urgent tasks said nicolae kostin the 53yearold chairman of 
the groups executive committee we will not attempt any steps in 
this direction without analyzing carefully how that may backfire 
against gorbachev and his policy of perestroika 
ms lari said in an interview that she worries a determined push 
for reunification with romania could lead to military intervention 
or even a coup against gorbachev 
for now peoples front leaders say they would be satisfied with 
what they call a brandenburg variant which envisions broader 
contacts across the border without full reunification berlins 
brandenburg gate after which the variant is named became a symbol 
of the division between east and west germany and was recently 
reopened to traffic and travelers 
but that course may not satisfy moldavians who are the most 
intense about reunification and are disgruntled with the soviet 
system 
a 19yearold student who identified herself only as tanya said 
reunification with romania now offers moldavians a chance to escape 
communism 
we are sick and tired with the way we have to live only 
because some halfliterate leader cant let down the ideals of 
socialism and we all have to suffer for it secession is the 
only chance for us to live properly and enjoy life while it is not 
too late while we are still young 
we have been lied to for 72 years said valentin barda a 
40yearold printer now its time we went our separate ways we 
will go to any length to achieve reunification 
the peoples front president ion hadirka said that after the 
romanian revolution some members of organization broke away and 
formed the stephan chel mare society named for stephan the great 
the 15th century romanian king whose statue stands in a kishinev 
park it calls for the question of reunification to be decided 
immediately 
and there are other indications the peoples front has little 
control over more radical elements pressing for reunification 
in november demonstrators climbed on soviet tanks to halt the 
traditional revolution day military parade and attacked the 
interior ministry headquarters with gasoline bombs stones and iron 
rods 
many of them refused to listen to peoples front leaders who 
appealed for calm 
protesters calling for russians to leave the republic of 42 
million people and chanting long live greater romania now share 
the streets with reinforced police patrols 
vladimir solonar an ethnic ukrainian leader of the unity 
movement formed to protect the rights of the 1 million russians 
ukrainians and other minorities in moldavia said he fears the 
peoples front might be too disorganized to control the situation 
the new moldavian communist party chief pyotr luchinsky told 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda that ethnic tension is his 
biggest worry demands for reunification were primarily an 
emotional reaction to the romanian revolution he said 
he added that the absolute majority of residents of the 
republic are not for union with romania but for more intensive 
contacts with our neighbor 
mikhail s platon a deputy premier of moldavia said we 
would like to raise the issue in such a way that people could 
travel to romania by car or by bus to go to the theater to meet 
each other freely 
but if reunification comes nina tsurcanu an ethnic russian 
with a husband and 3yearold son says she wont be part of it 
even it means breaking up the family 
my husband is moldavian she explained i love him but if 
he decides to stay here after they secede i will leave no matter 
what i will go away with my son and parents 
they call us occupants and oppressors my parents came here 
after the war to help restore the ruined industry do we deserve 
all this now 
as young people marched recently in kishinev with romanian flags 
and shouts of russians go away long live greater romania a 
lanky russian youth of 14 named alex wondered about his future 
he said that his moldavian friends no longer have anything to do 
with him and that his parents are thinking of moving to the 
industrial city of chelyabinsk in the ural mountains where they 
have relatives 
i wonder if there are some native people there too who dont 
want russians he said

men dont leave 
 
beth macauley wanders catatonically through the basement web of 
a maryland hospital trying to find the morgue so she can check the 
remains of her dead husband she throws open a door and happens 
upon a bevy of chefs chopping up raw chickens and collapses into 
uncontrollable sobs 
it is this quirky blend of the ordinary the extraordinary the 
absurd and the surreal that makes paul brickmans men dont 
leave more than just another soapy look at a family tragedy 
jessica lange continues to fascinate with her range of emotions 
and faces as beth she reverts to an unexceptional housewife and 
mother whose entire existence is focused on her family when left 
with a bundle of bills after her husband dies in an explosion an 
enraged teenage son and a younger more introverted son she copes 
by leaving comfortable suburbia for the rough and crowded confines 
of baltimores inner city 
she finds work as an assistant manager a gofer really for 
a shrill neurotic who runs a gourmet food store and meets the 
understanding sensitive man her youngest son matt charlie 
korsmo takes up with a middleclass juvenile delinquent and her 
oldest son chris chris odonnell finds love in the arms of an 
allknowing allseeing amazon of an older woman jody joan 
cusack 
brickman takes us in fits and starts through the inevitable 
motherson fights and confrontations bouts of depression lessons 
in friendship loyalty and trust in the end it all works out 
beth learns acceptance and believes in herself 
but the package is not as neat as it sounds beths journey is 
all too episodic like a madefortelevision movie and there are 
too many cute pieces of business such as when she delivers a 
basket of lunch to a rehearsing orchestra and drops oranges along 
the way and finally the entire basket 
brickman seems to see middleclass america through barbed wire 
glasses and he takes marvelous risks in risky business he 
gave us an aspiring college student who earned money by turning his 
parents house into a brothel it was funny and it worked 
in men dont leave mrs average upstanding housewife learns 
to like her childs lover a woman close to her own age 
cusack is a delight as the older woman she steals the scene 
the minute she appears commanding presence that she is with her 
measured tone and wideeyed wonder 
the yougsters are fine without being cloying corey carrier as 
the juvenile thug winston buckley is carved from the same mold 
that coughed up the little rascals decades ago hes bad but hes 
cute 
brickman directed from a screenplay written by himself and 
barbara benedek the story was by benedek the brickmanjon avnet 
production is released by the geffen company and is rated pg13

mountains of the moon 
 
when lawrence of arabia was rereleased last year in all its 
bigscreen uncut glory the cry went up why dont they make 
movies like this anymore answer they do 
mountains of the moon has all the excitement adventure and 
human conflict of lawrence of arabia while the carolco 
production may lack the polish that perfectionist david lean gave 
to his 1962 classic mountains is still firstrate movie 
storytelling 
the discovery of the source of the nile in the mid19th century 
was as clouded in controversy as the journey to the north pole a 
halfcentury later the contenders richard burton the 
largerthanlife irish adventurerauthorscientist and john speke 
an english army officer from an aristocratic family 
director bob rafelson and william harrison based the script on 
harrisons biographical novel about the two explorers as well as 
their original journals what emerges is a complex tale of two men 
of widely divergent backgrounds who become brothers on their 
perilous journey 
the african adventure is magnificently portrayed and it is 
bookended by episodes in england that are less engaging the first 
part delineates the characters of burton patrick bergin a 
dashing adventurous figure who wins the heart of a strongwilled 
english lady fiona shaw and speke iain glen a blond 
blueblooded young man who comes under the sinister influence of a 
homosexual publisher richard e grant 
the final part of the film concerns the aftermath of the 
exploration as the two comrades are torn apart by misunderstanding 
and dispute over which one should be honored by the national 
geographic society 
rafelson conveys the complicated story with admirable concision 
despite the cost some big scenes last only a few seconds just 
long enough to establish needed story points known mostly for 
intimate films such as five easy pieces and stay hungry 
rafelson displays a rare talent for the epic his battle scenes are 
extraordinary 
bergin captures all the brusque authority and zest for life of 
burton in the less showy role as speke glen is equally 
impressive fiona shaw is wise knowing and sensual as mrs burton 
the tristar release was produced by daniel melnick and bears an 
r rating presumably for brief nudity and considerable violence

ave verum corpus motets and anthems by william byrd collegium 
the cambridge singers directed by john rutter 
peter philips paradisus sacris cantionibus accent currende 
directed by erik van nevel 
 
it is a comfort to have a recording at last of william byrds 
non vos relinquam orphanos i will not leave you 
comfortless 
not even two minutes long the motet is a little masterpiece of 
elizabethan music byrd combines a powerful feeling of sadness at 
parting with a quietly affirmative alleluia 
though he enjoyed the patronage of the protestant queen 
elizabeth i byrd clung to his roman catholic faith a devotion 
that cost others their lives non vos relinquam like most of 
his later work was written for catholic services held in homes and 
probably sung by musical amateurs 
the cambridge singers all adults never approach the grandeur 
of a cathedral choir of men and boys however with 71 minutes of 
music and excellent notes its an exemplary addition to the small 
but growing number of byrd recordings 
peter philips was also an english catholic and may have been 
byrds pupil before fleeing to the low countries but he belonged 
to another world 
ecce vicit leo behold the lion the first of the 22 
motets presented by the belgian choir currende sounds very like 
giovanni gabrielis doublechoir compositions for st marks 
cathedral in venice 
the feeling is confident extravagant in contrast to byrds 
restraint 
philips has been sorely neglected in recordings and this 
generous polished recording is a solid beginning

evidence chrysalis boo hewerdine and darden smith 
 
this is a serendipitous musical meeting that almost makes the 
traveling wilburys seem calculated by comparison 
boo hewerdine fronts an obscure british band called the bible 
darden smith is a struggling texas singersongwriter in new york 
city for the 1988 new music seminar they were introduced by a 
mutual friend hit it off and began writing songs together it took 
just eight days to write a terrific albums worth of songs 
evidence exudes good feeling this is folkrock with a 
smile music with the spark of inspiration close to the surface 
out of this world vividly evokes the walkingonair feeling of 
new love and does it with such simplicity that nursery rhymes are 
quoted for lyrics on reminds me a little of you a listener 
can practically feel the presence of the woman for whom the 
narrator is pining 
like so many albums today the acoustic guitar is the musical 
centerpiece with other instruments added for dashes of colors 
call it the tracy chapman effect it allows the artists to sink or 
swim solely on the strength of their songs of the 12 songs on this 
record a lucky 13 on cd theres not a weak cut 
i want my cake mixed in with my pie hewerdine and smith 
sing on the slightly absurd all i want is everything heres 
hoping they get their wish

human soul rca graham parker 
 
graham parker is one of those artists the critics love but most 
of the public has never heard hes too intelligent and quirky for 
top 40 and aor stations and not quite radical enough for many 
college stations 
thats where home stereos come in 
human soul parkers 12th lp will tickle your tape deck 
rev up your record player 
he continues in the bright pop rock groove of his last album 
the mona lisas sister but here he quickens the pace on many 
tracks and cranks up his colorful imagination 
little miss understanding kicks it off with danceable 
skainflected sounds and typical wordplay youre a woman with a 
crazy man like a wasp thats stuck in jam but i wont sting you 
if you dont sting me 
after a few ballads and pop songs parker closes out the real 
side or side 1 with soultime the ska sound comes back 
bigger with horns reminiscent of the specials and blends with a 
reggaeified beat something hes dabbled in on other albums 
but the real action is on the surreal side or side 2 
everything goes starts off a suite of five continuous songs 
that are faster and darker than those on the flip side 
everything showcases parkers unusual talent for combining 
heavy lyrics with lighthearted punchy melodies to a sweet tune 
he sings about a serial killer and more mundane horrors 
he jumps right into the hypedup sugar gives you energy 
then a sardonic tale of suburbia daddys a postman and green 
monkeys a cryptic doodling about aids 
the suite closes out with i was wrong where the music stops 
cold sucked right out of existence 
on the last cut slash and burn he bites hard but he still 
offers a headbobbing beat 
parker gets more urgent with this lp than he did on his last 
record or in his mellower another grey area period around 1982 
the world could end dead in its tracks just as this record does 
he suggests 
but not if parker can help it

and its being treated gently by 20th century fox the release 
pattern has been slow the studio hoping that critical raves and 
favorable wordofmouth will attract audiences to such a special 
kind of movie 
whether enemies wins oscars and boxoffice returns silver 
believes the film is a victory for all concerned proving a quality 
film with literary elements can get made in hollywood 
silvers roots are as deeply jewish as herman broders his 
maternal grandparents came from poland to new yorks lower east 
side where silver grew up fascinated with foreign cultures he 
gained a bachelors degree in chinese and spanish at the state 
university of new york at buffalo and a masters at st johns 
university in new york and at the taiwan college of culture 
i dwindled into acting he remarked 
first came high school teaching i thought i was a good 
teacher i cared about what i was teaching i wanted to reach the 
kids and i wanted to make it entertaining i wanted them to see 
what they were learning had application to their lives im 
disappointed that when i left the school they all didnt stand on 
their desks and say o captain my captain as in dead poets 
society 
silver quit to continue his travels abroad for his advanced 
degree in 196869 he studied in vietnam laos cambodia taiwan 
india and hong kong he was caught in the middle of the 
chinasoviet border conflict crossed the soviet union on the 
transsiberian railroad and was arrested in leningrad 
when i got back i decided not to complete my phd and not to 
go into the government which i was supposed to do he said i 
drifted for a while took acting classes was a social worker i 
enjoyed the acting classes and i received a lot of encouragement 
from my early teachers i was involved in academia for the longest 
time and this was kind of fun to go home with a blonde and 
rehearse a scene 
i got lucky right away found an agent and started getting 
jobs i dont know how tenacious i would have been if i had to 
stick it through acting was not a lifelong passion with me 
silver has led a busy career in films garbo talks 
silkwood theater hurlyburly speed the plow and 
television the billionaire boys club wise guy he admits 
he was not mazurskys first choice for enemies a love story 
nor was i the second choice he said with a laugh it 
makes sense artistically and businesswise to go with somebody who 
has a name i dont know who was approached but i can guess 
dustin hoffman and richard dreyfuss for one reason or another it 
didnt work out 
he responded immediately to mazurskys proposal not only 
because he believed in the material 
also it was a challenge for me he said because it was 
different from roles i had been doing which were fairly exuberant 
aggressive articulate expressive people this guy was just the 
opposite 
silver sees one element favoring the movies oscar chances it 
always seems to happen with pictures that take a long time to get 
made where there is little compromising with the integrity of the 
picture rain man had a tough time being made also platoon and 
ghandi it was a real labor of love for the director and a lot 
of studios turned it down 
enemies was first developed by mazursky at touchstone 
pictures which had a winner with his down and out in beverly 
hills the disney people finally decided against proceeding and 
the film ended up with the independent morgan creek fox is the 
releasing company 
silver admits he would love to see enemies and incidentally 
himself receive academy honors the reason for the allure of oscar 
this country likes winners they treat winners very 
specially he said laughing the president refers to the 
winning team he doesnt talk about the losing team he doesnt 
say hey listen you guys had a tremendous amount of character 
who cares who won this country is about winning

ashraf anjoorgar leans closer to his 
makeshift canvas to dab a more wishful shade of blue at the sky 
above the minaret of jam 
his painting shows the 900yearold monument in central ghor 
province as it looked before the damage and neglect wrought by more 
than a decade of afghanistans civil war 
ashraf works by light that filters through sandbagged windows 
at kabul universitys fine arts building there is no heat or 
electricity 
a lot of our most talented artists have left because of the 
war he said with the help of an interpreter there are many 
young artists who want to learn but there is a shortage of 
materials to teach them 
he made his canvas by stretching a piece of bed linen over a 
wooden frame there arent enough brushes paints or materials such 
as gypsum and marble for sculpture 
ashraf is an instructor and has joined about 3000 afghan 
painters sculptors musicians dramatists cinematographers and 
architects in trying to preserve their embattled countrys ancient 
art and cultural traditions 
mohammad haider pardes an architect and president of the union 
of artists associations of afghanistan says many of his members 
can earn a living only by lending their talents to the 
moscowbacked government 
the art gallery at kabul university alma mater of afghanistan 
president najib and his archrival fundamentalist rebel leader 
gulbaddin hekmatyar is a collage of pastoral landscapes 
depictions of archeological treasures portraits sculptures and 
posters 
most have mundane motifs but the posters especially bear the 
hard lines of a political exhortation to defend the homeland 
against usbacked moslem rebels they have fought for 11 years to 
topple the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan and 
replace it with an allislamic government 
some of our artists work for the government some of the time 
but otherwise theyre free to create whatever they want pardes 
said 
very few of our artists have formal training weve been 
sending them to the soviet union india and east european 
countries he said we are interested in preserving our 
cultural heritage but we are also trying to introduce our culture 
to others this training program helps us do both 
pardes admitted however that the fall of several communist 
governments in eastern europe has disrupted the program the army 
has too all afghan men must serve at least once the fine arts 
faculty at kabul are required to put in two years their 300 
students can look forward to four after graduation if the 
stalemated war lasts 
faculty members also must join the ruling party pardes said 
but not the students most of whom are the children of party 
members 
he said that other talented afghans either have been killed 
pressed into government service or fled the country among more than 
5 million refugees one of the countrys most renowned young 
painters works as a construction engineer 
pardes union office is carpeted and plush but as an architect 
he designs public housing blocks mosques and parks for which there 
is no money to build 
like many of kabuls 2 million people he hopes this year will 
bring some kind of peace to afghanistan 
were trying to preserve our heritage many of our finest 
monuments have been destroyed i think people dont have more 
patience with this bloody situation he said 
more than 15 million afghans a tenth of the countrys prewar 
population are believed to have died since the 1978 marxist coup 
that installed the ruling pdpa and touched off the insurgency 
soviet forces fought alongside the government for nine years but 
withdrew last february

phil collins writes his album titles last to 
reflect the the mood of the music on the album 
his new album is but seriously the first single 
another day in paradise is about the homeless there also are 
songs about famine and apartheid 
in a recent interview collins recalled his last solo album 
no jacket required in 1985 
apart from the little story of a chicago hotel that wouldnt 
let me into the bar because i wasnt wearing a jacket i thought 
the album was hotter more danceable material than my previous 
two he said i wanted to do something now that had a little 
bit more depth to it for a variety of reasons 
one is that it follows collins acting and songs in the movie 
buster a film about the great train robbery 
not a light subject but the way the film treated that subject 
it was kind of a romantic comedy he said that was fine 
because it was an acting role when i got involved with the music 
i think the results to the casual person in the street were maybe a 
little light 
i was working with lamont dozier a hero of mine and it was a 
film project it didnt bother me a groovy kind of love was a 
60s song i think a lot of people thought it was a phil collins 
solo project and felt i was getting very very light that wasnt 
where i was coming from 
i thought let me put that right with my next album that 
was one of the reasons the content of some songs was a little 
different for me 
most of the album reflects romantic and other individual 
concerns i think theyre my best collection of songs since face 
value he said that was his first solo album in 1981 followed 
a year later by hello i must be going 
after all ive done it is nice to know the best is still yet 
to come really collins said the album was great fun to 
write not having done it for five years many of them came easily 
there was a lot to come out 
hell tour until september id like to do another film the 
end of 1990 weve got to do a genesis album the beginning of 1991 
i dont want to get involved with a big tour again so soon after 
the solo tour 
by that time ill be almost 40 id like to do another album 
maybe id like to concentrate on films i think well tour with 
genesis because its part of what we do it wont be if i can 
help it anywhere near as long as genesis last tour which was 10 
months 
the gigs become the most important part of the day everything 
else tends to be very boring one hotel after another one plane 
after another i never get bored with the gigs theyre always 
different i can hea people say hes bored with firstclass 
hotels it does get boring id rather be at home doing the 
shopping 
speaking of boredom collins said there is always a risk that 
people get bored with phil collins that reached a peak in 198586 
when we had five top 5 singles with no jacket required and 
genesis invisible touch had five top 5 the voice was constantly 
on the radio there was a severe danger of overkill which is why i 
took a year away from music and did buster 
people still played the records on the radio he said the 
thing that sticks in my mind is a guitar player said milwaukee had 
a guaranteed phil collinsfree weekend when radio stations 
guarantee not to play you you know youre in trouble 
i dont want to not work because people play the records too 
much 
some of but seriously was recorded in los angeles david 
crosby who sings on another day in paradise and horn players 
collins wanted to use live there jill collins is from los angeles 
their daughter lily 10 months will go on the 1990 tour and his 
older children a daughter 17 and son 13 will join them in 
australia on their spring break 
while recording collins said there are technical things that 
can thicken the voice such as echoes 
theyre security blankets some singers use to mask 
inadequacies he said i was guilty of that my voice became a 
bit of a sound rather than just the voice i think my singing has 
gotten better over the last few years i expose it more on this 
album i use less effects 
since buster which came out in late 1988 collins produced 
three songs on stephen bishops album and played on woman in 
chains tears for fears current single 
eric clapton who is one of my best friends was making his 
album around the same time i did my album he played on mine i 
played on his collins said 
he didnt expect his success and it has always surprised him 
if you take things for granted thats when the trouble starts 
people say why is it what you do appeals to other people i 
have no idea if i knew then id probably screw it up he said 
maybe i write lyrics that are very direct people understand 
them and relate to them maybe thats why what happens happens 
apart from that you do it to please yourself first if other 
people like it thats great

under the living room carpet in the 
converted barn author ken kesey calls home is a wrestling mat that 
has cushioned roughhousing with his four children and is a 
touchstone for the life he leads on his farm 
ive always been very tight with my family said kesey who 
saw both his sons follow in his footsteps as wrestlers for the 
university of oregon its always been the most important thing 
in my life 
kesey has lived on this farm since 1965 after his novels one 
flew over the cuckoos nest and sometimes a great notion won 
him literary fame his father and brother both owned it before him 
when i was working on sometimes a great notion one of the 
reasons i could do it was because i was unknown he said i 
could get all those balls in the air and keep them up there and 
nothing would come along and distract me now theres a lot of 
stuff happens that happens because im famous and famous isnt 
good for a writer you dont observe well when youre being 
observed 
many of the outbuildings on the farm were built by the merry 
pranksters he led in the psychedelic bus trip across america 
chronicled by tom wolfe in the electric koolaid acid test the 
bus called further is parked out back 
everybody in my family knows what ive done ive smoked dope 
and would still be smoking dope if i could get some kesey said 
i know enough about drugs to know that you cant really be 
a good family person and take certain types of drugs they turn you 
into yourself cocaine and the opiates any of the barbiturates 
booze those harm your family 
but the real psychedelics they increase your awareness of the 
spiritual forces around you which i think increases your love i 
dont know anybody who ever had family problems because of smoking 
marijuana they may have had financial problems because theyre too 
lazy to get up and go to work but they always like to hang around 
and play with the kids and the dogs be in the kitchen 
kesey got his first taste of lsd in the early 1960s in 
governmentrun experiments in menlo park calif where he also was 
studying writing under wallace stegner at stanford university his 
first novel one flew over the cuckoos nest was published in 
1962 
i felt like i was doing as american a thing as neil armstrong 
when he volunteered to go to the moon kesey said of the drug 
experiments there was a new place to be explored and we were 
astronauts 
that exploration of new territory is a very american thing 
say youre doing cocaine that is not exploration of new territory 
thats just a titillation 
most recently kesey has been giving performances of tricker 
the squirrel meets big double the bear a story told by his 
grandmother and set to music by a neighbor art maddox 
he figures that videotapes of writers reading their works into 
the cameras eye interspersed with actors presenting scenes will 
take the place of books his son zane has done a tricker 
piece that cuts between kesey with the orchestra and kesey 
lipsyncing in the swamp behind his home 
it will take over for about 50 or 70 years and then all that 
machinery will fall apart and well be back to the printed word 
kesey said 
kesey has taken a lot of heat for not producing another novel to 
put beside the first two but he is halfway through one now and 
under contract to finish it this year 
theres a saying from william faulkner who said every so 
often the dog has to go against the bear just to keep calling 
himself a dog the novel is the real bear 
called sailors song the book is set in a fishing village 
on the coast of southeastern alaska a little bit in the future 
when things are bleaker and more hedonistic than they are now 
i think its about love at the end of the world kesey says 
can you love when you know things are coming to an end 
the main characters are an indian woman and a cropduster who 
moves to town from fresno calif after the death of his child 
before leaving california he loads his plane from a truck that 
pumps out portable toilets and sprays the state fair 
when not working on the novel kesey is involved with his wife 
faye who was his high school sweetheart and their children 
shannon zane jed and sunshine who all grew up on the farm jed 
was buried here after his death in 1984 in the crash of a van 
carrying the university of oregon wrestling team to pullman wash 
i learned something from jeds death which is how badly it 
hurts and that if i were to die it would hurt other people and i 
dont want to hurt other people kesey said i button my seat 
belt and wear my life jacket i used to think its my life i can 
do with it what i want but its not just my life 
recently he and zane planted some trees along the property 
line at 54 kesey doesnt expect to see the trees reach maturity 
but feels they are part of the chain that is family 
kesey has a granddaughter katherine grace born to shannon 
shortly after new years day and he is angered that many americans 
doom their progeny by despoiling the environment 
it used to be that old people instead of spending their money 
at the end of their life would be passing that money on to their 
children and grandchildren kesey said but now weve been 
taught to go ahead and waste it fill the sky with poison were 
not going to be here anyway 
i have vowed not to do that this piece of land wont move out 
of this family once you bury a kid on your land it would take a 
bulldozer and a large government to move you 
kesey recalled how several years ago a busload of people 
stopped by on their way from california to kansas and asked kesey 
to come along 
they all had a vision that the whole west coast was going to 
fall in the ocean and they were all moving to kansas kesey said 
they were the messiest bunch when they finished with a can they 
just threw it peoples clothes were dirty their hair was uncut 
they were angry with us for not joining them 
they were sitting there and faye got up and came back with a 
big knife and saw i said where are you going she said im 
going to go prune the fruit trees 
thats my feeling even if it is going to fall into the ocean 
you still have got to prune the fruit trees and wash the dishes and 
take care of the daily chores of keeping the world running

ken kesey took 12 writers from the 
university of oregon master of fine arts program into his house 
then showed them the tricks of writing a novel by having them 
produce one 
like many first efforts this one started awkwardly with kesey 
knocking himself cold on a window frame trying to break into the 
house he uses in eugene because he forgot the key 
but the ending was a happy one viking penguin bought the 
manuscript and in january released caverns by ou levon 
taken from uo novel spelled backwards 
caverns is set in 1934 chosen by kesey because it is the 
year before his own birth the psychedelic pioneer of the 1960s is 
the author of one flew over the cuckoos nest and sometimes a 
great notion 
the story for caverns describes how carnival huckster 
charles oswald loach is released from san quentin where he is 
serving 20 years for murder to lead an expedition aboard an army 
surplus field ambulance to a mysterious cave purported to contain a 
wild mix of prehistoric paintings that challenge the basic tenets 
of anthropology 
we didnt set a high standard kesey said of the book which 
was published in paperback on soft paper to give it a pulp fiction 
feel if we had decided to write thomas pynchons gravitys 
rainbow we would be still writing or we would have stopped 
writing 
kesey had everyone develop a character they evolved into loach 
his desert rat brother a girl who grew up in loachs carnival act 
a white supremacist brick maker a sailor an anthropologist a 
priest an alcoholic newspaperman a wouldbe movie producer and 
two oldmaid spiritualist sisters 
unlike the collaborative novels in which writers have taken a 
chapter to themselves this one was written with everyone pulling a 
piece of each chapter out of a hat then getting 30 minutes to 
write it afterward the book went through two revisions 
if youve got a good point guard and two power forwards and 
keep moving the ball around somebodys going to score kesey 
said 
the method also minimized individual style and the shark attacks 
so common in writing workshops 
you were in fine shape if you started out the chapter said 
h highwater powers you could lay it out if you were the last 
person you had to adjust you had to think on your feet 
kesey said that was one of the great lessons of the class 
in the hard and sticky and dry parts that you come to in your 
life or your work all you have to do is put one foot in front of 
the other and pretty soon you find yourself in places you didnt 
expect to be he said theres no way you can teach that you 
can only learn that 
he recalled one discussion when someone complained that the plot 
had taken an unbelievable turn 
i said thats the job of the writer kesey said weve 
got to take the square peg and jam it into the round hole 
the life of it comes from making people believe that these 
people are drawing breath and standing up casting shadows and 
living lives and feeling agonies 
and thats a trick its a glorious trick and its a trick 
that you can be taught its not just a thing that comes from 
the muses

cooking is the focus though davidson also sings 
the 48yearold davidson whos associated with such shows as 
hollywood squares and thats incredible says his wife may 
have upstaged him on the cable show 
they show executives and crew were more impressed with 
rhonda than me he said cheerfully in a telephone interview from 
his los angelesarea houseboat everyone said your wife was 
great no one said much about me 
rhonda a former background singer with little tv experience 
said she was surprised at the positive reception she received 
ive always been more of a background person with no desire to 
be out front she said i expected to be nervous but people 
put me at ease because they were so warm and kind john was 
supportive too 
i just went on the show and did my john davidson impression 
ive watched him work and seen how he deals with the audience and 
how he conducted himself 
for davidson who has sung some country songs during his career 
the series is yet another outlet for showcasing his tv talents 
he just finished three years as host of hollywood squares

he believes the future of cable tv the home of his programs on 
tnn and espn is limitless 
producers have to find a place for their shows and they are 
turning to cable davidson said in the next five years i 
think the tv dial is going to be like a radio dial youll have 
trouble knowing which is a network station or a cable station or an 
independent itll be all one happy dial and youll turn it just 
like on the radio 
davidson used to be a guest on hollywood squares when peter 
marshall was host then ended up in marshalls chair posing 
questions to the celebrities who would try to stump contestants 
i liked to bluff and fool people and give an esoteric 
impressive answer and try to seem erudite he said in fact i 
didnt know the answer but i got a lot of laughter that way 
davidson said his most memorable segment on thats 
incredible was when he entered the cage of a giant lizard they 
locked the cage on me or pretended to and ive never been more 
frightened in my life it was scary

in an age of multibilliondollar buyouts and 
mergers an unassuming army of 13000 is teaching americans to 
think small 
members of the volunteer senior corps of retired executives draw 
on decades of business experience as they offer free oneonone 
counseling to people who are just getting started in small business 
or who need help moving ahead 
since we have attained hardwon skills in our business lives 
this is the best way we can volunteer said ann oxley a score 
member from fort wayne ind who volunteered for a year as the 
groups marketing director here 
its refreshing to see that you can use what you learned from 
all the bumps and slashes you got going through the business 
jungle 
score sponsored by the small business administration has 
13000 active members 80 percent retirees and 20 percent active 
businesspeople those still in business generally help put on 
workshops that score offers its clients for a small fee with more 
than 750 chapters and satellite groups nationwide score has served 
more than 3 million people over the past 25 years 
just recently score and the sba sent out a notice seeking 
information on retirees with language skills that might be useful 
as eastern european nations open to the west volunteers may be 
asked to help translate publications or speak to foreign 
delegations 
john daniels executive director and one of only seven fulltime 
paid employees said scores impact is hard to measure in dollars 
and cents but success stories abound 
in hostetter pa score counselor lou sabers helped the 
struggling volunteer fire department cut its loan payments in half 
by obtaining a special 2 percent emergency loan from the state 
they told us they were on the brink of bankruptcy sabers said 
in independence mo norman westheimer a 78yearold former 
vice president of the former gem corp helped brenda louderback 
revamp her ad strategy for diessl jewelers and analyze her 
profitandloss statements i only wish i had studied harder and 
followed more closely the advice and input that was so generously 
offered louderback said 
in san diego 76yearold david gilbert with 30 years in the 
importexport business helped brothers jim and joseph hadzicki 
turn their prototype giant kite into revolution kites which racked 
up 500000 in sales its first year it was nice to have somebody 
who had been through this kind of stuff before who could recommend 
the proper steps said jim hadzicki 
other lessevident successes are found in the ranks of people 
who decide not to go into business or to postpone it after score 
members lay out the demands of running a small business and the 
potential pitfalls 
a survey of score clients in the midwest found that 27 percent 
had canceled or delayed plans to go into business after contacting 
the organization in some cases preserving savings that otherwise 
might have been lost to failure 
we have people who think about taking their retirement money 
and opening up a pizza parlor right across the street from a pizza 
hut daniels said 
we have prevented many many casualties which is good for the 
american economy as well as for the individual ego its crushing 
to fail oxley said 
score in many cases is able to match retired executives with 
novices who need advice in the same area of expertise daniels 
said the organization keeps a special roster of those with 
international trade experience in order to help small business 
people expand their exports there are many opportunities over 
there but you have to know your way around he said 
score counselors who have an average of 35 years of business 
experience say they benefit themselves even as they help others 
get started in business 
westheimer has been a score counselor for 15 years and still

ways to find information 
if we want to do it its up to us 
while revolution kites is well on it way jim hadzicki still 
calls gilbert for occasional advice for example hadzicki knew he 
should take gifts when he visited potential customers in japan but 
he didnt know what to take he went with gilberts suggestions of 
black label scotch for the men and estee lauder products for the 
women it was just nice to talk to somebody before going 
the oldest active score counselor has been 93yearold wp 
campbell of searcy ark who recently decided hell move to 
inactive status after handling cases for 22 years whenever you 
do something for other people you get a big kick out of it

it is a quilt the women of st 
marys church are sewing calloused fingers punching tiny needles 
through thick layers of cloth but what they bind together is a 
community 
the talk in the basement of the clapboard church is about babies 
and sewing patterns husbands who spent the fall hunting and sons 
moving back to town 
they bought a house 
they move away to make money and then they come back that 
keeps the town going 
the chat is as pieced as the pinkandblue heartsanddiamonds 
quilt top sewn together at home by cheryl rexroat bunek whos so 
busy with six children and her husbands plumbing business to run 
that she cant come to quiltings 
no conversation goes deep at the biweekly winter meeting of the 
st marys quilters a dozen women around two large quilts 
stretched across lumber frames the quilts like the women who make 
them generation after generation stitch together life in this 
tiny northern michigan town population 368 
we never gossip insists mildred kirt 81 a thin woman with 
a cap of short charcoal gray curls her son mike moved back 10 
years ago 
the cold air off lake michigan chases two more women down the 
stairwell they add their coats to the pile on the table their 
fingers to the sewing and their voices to the conversation 
talk and sew talk and sew the ladies of st marys have been 
doing this to raise money for the church further back than anyone 
can recall an endless succession of patterns that mirror their 
lives courthouse steps double wedding ring grandmas flower 
garden seven sisters 
its a rich tradition of smalltown life centered on an aging 
church and a country parish of 250 families the farmers coop is 
closed and the train depot is gone but st marys endures 
there wouldnt be much of a town if there wasnt the church 
says lynn edwards adding a swirling border to frame the calico 
heart mildred is sewing 
for these people the church is still a center of life their 
social life says the rev walt derylo here you take a step 
back in time 
he is talking from st michaels church four miles away in 
suttons bay st marys has no resident pastor theres a shortage 
of priests in the church 
the women talk about that too 
the pope should let priests marry one says 
these womens mothers in 1904 made a signature quilt to raise 
money for the church a dime donation embroidered your place in 
devotion your name stitched in red around the silhouette of st 
marys 
the spread was won at raffle by a priest who gave it to a 
family that needed it for warmth against the michigan night the 
leelanau peninsula was timbered bare by then poor potato farmers 
were all that were left the rolling peninsula wasnt yet planted 
in the quaint cherry orchards that would attract tourists from 
chicago and detroit antique shops and condominium builders 
in summer now tourists crowd the lanes with 10speed bicycles 
browse for antiques and take home smoked fish in paper bundles tied 
with string 
but in winter lake leelanau remains shut into itself and the 
old ways the st marys women meet tuesdays and thursdays they 
raise about 10000 a year for the church and its pride a 
101yearold 13grade school 
the old signature quilt hangs in the leelanau historical museum 
600some faded names on rough unbleached muslin 
gauthier belanger curator laura quackenbush starts to 
read you can see the frenchcanadian influence and the german 
the schaubs emelia schaub emelia is 96 now living at the 
omena house nursing home 
shes the first woman prosecutor to practice in michigan 
elected in 1936 and reelected five times actually another 
woman was elected first but was thrown out by the governor who 
said it was an illegal occupation for women 
quilting was part of womens work a way to keep warm at night 
to tie a community together to raise money for churches schools 
the needy mennonite women in oscoda county sell quilts to benefit 
a worldwide hunger fund a woman in eastern michigan sells her 
quilts to pay her sons college tuition 
they used to laugh at us says barb merica at 59 one of the 
youngest they are the men but its barb whos laughing now 
eyes twinkling over glasses perched on the end of her nose the 
quilts go for hundreds of dollars each these days many never touch 
a bed instead hanging from walls like giant paintings 
mildred kirt doesnt understand these quilts dont seem so 
fancy to me 
when i was a girl i thought my mother was so dumb to cut all 
those pieces and sew them back together but i see now its an 
art 
in 70 years of sewing mildred has made quilts for the beds of 
her four children and their 15 children and is starting on the 
greatgrandkids 
suzanne plamondon 75 did the same for eight kids and 16 
grandchildren 
jen lacross made hers for nine children and 28 grandchildren 
theres a splash of red on the fabric claire routzahn has 
pricked herself hard and blood drips from her fingertip she mops 
it with a little water no one pays attention theres a lot of 
blood spilt over a quilt barb says 
and some pain 
mildreds mother josephine hahnenberg was a terror as a 
quilter exacting and demanding of the talents of young brides who 
sought admission every careless stitch hundreds of them had to 
be ripped out 
i came home crying every night suzanne says my husband 
consoled me told me not to give up to stand up to this woman he 
said shell respect you in the end they became good friends 
and fishing buddies 
quilting is no longer the rite of womanhood in lake leelanau 
daughters have jobs and other demands 
its already been a struggle to keep the group from unraveling 
barb and florence scharnowski and laura couturier pitched in to 
take over the organizing work when flo lamie died of cancer 
flos biggest worry was would the quilting fall apart barb 
says 
who is there to replace the replacements 
barb sighs if we dont get young blood like all things it 
will die 
the morning wears the chatter slows the women roll up the ends 
of the finished spread as they work scooting their chairs forward 
and inward it is godawful cold outside and getting worse as the 
day develops but in the warm basement the women of st marys keep 
sewing knees to knees around an evershrinking quilt

like many middleaged and older americans 
carolyn connor was raised to believe that nice people didnt get 
divorced 
but at 49 shes been married divorced remarried and widowed 
society raised me to think it was an embarrassment to get a 
divorce but he was an alcoholic when i got a little money from 
my grandfathers estate it gave me the guts to leave said 
connor who was divorced at 33 
it really makes me feel sorry for people who dont have the 
money 
sociologists say that while divorce rates have stabilized for 
younger women they are increasing for older women and newly 
divorced middleaged and older women have a harder time financially 
than widows or those divorced early 
almost everyone recognized there was a tremendous increase in 
divorce rates since the 1960s said peter uhlenberg a university 
of north carolina sociologist divorce is concentrated in younger 
women most occur before age 40 women in later life those who 
are old now have not been affected by these changes were trying 
to anticipate what happens when women in their younger adult years 
hit their 60s and 70s 
uhlenberg and his associates teresa cooney now at the 
university of delaware and robert boyd presently a graduate 
student at the university of south carolina used data from the 
us census vital statistics and current population survey for 
their study published in the january edition of the journal of 
gerontology social sciences 
they found that one woman in eight will have her first marriage 
end in divorce after she reaches age 40 and the probability of 
remarriage is slim decreasing rapidly with age in 1985 for 
example researchers found fewer than three out of 100 divorced 
women aged 45 to 64 remarried 
there are competing explanations for why more older women are 
getting divorced and remaining unmarried its becoming more 
feasible for women to support themselves outside of marriage there 
are more work opportunities the age before marriage has gone up 
the whole idea of being married is becoming less likeable after 
doing it once uhlenberg said 
the economic status family relationships social support and 
emotional stability of recently divorced middleaged and older 
women vary dramatically from those comparably married widowed or 
longtermed divorced women 
much more often a widowed woman will have a house which is a 
major asset going into old age uhlenberg said widowed women are 
also more likely to have their husbands pension as a source of 
income but for divorced older women the social implications are 
very different 
a widowed woman is much more likely to be living independently 
and not working he said divorced women are compensating 
economically by sharing their living expenses and working 
it takes a while to recover financially from divorce said 
ms connor who has worked as a secretary for three years to 
supplement her late husbands disabled veterans benefits and at 
the time i divorced they didnt really enforce child support i 
had my husband arrested twice for not paying and all they did was 
put him in jail overnight and then let him go 
the picture becomes more bleak for older minority women 
uhlenberg said 
divorce rates are significantly higher for blacks we know 
that the economic implications are about what they are for white 
women its just that more black women will experience economic 
disadvantages 
another factor affecting divorce rates is the increased 
acceptability of single mothers and cohabitation before marriage 
he said and the more these types of families exist the less 
likely children of such groups are to be socialized into the 
pattern of stable family relationships 
what were doing now is looking at one of the implications of 
divorce on older men which will be published this month he 
said specifically the impact of divorce on older men and their 
relationship with their children 
weve found that older divorced men are much less likely to 
have contact with their adult children they report the 
relationship to be less satisfactory 
for women we find a greater impact on an economic level 
while for men the implication would be in terms of social 
support

women who are suddenly widowed survive the 
trauma better than men whose spouses die unexpectedly but when 
death follows lengthy illness men seem to handle things better a 
sociologist says 
studies have shown that women generally weather a spouses death 
better than men but womens traditional role as caregiver works 
against them when a death follows prolonged illness said ken smith 
of the university of utah 
the idea here is that women because they are taking on more 
caregiver burden are likely to face a higher rate of mortality 
smith said 
working with data from a multifaceted nationwide study of 5000 
married couples that began in 1968 smith studied data from 113 
widowers and 383 widows over 14 years after a spouse died and 
compared each with a control couple 
men who suddenly became widowed were 52 percent more likely to 
die within 14 years than men whose wives remained alive while men 
whose wives died after a long illness were only 13 percent more 
likely to die than nonwidowers 
women whose husbands died suddenly faced a marginal mortality 
risk 1 percent but those enduring a husbands prolonged illness 
and death were 49 percent more likely to die than nonwidows smith 
said 
he speculates that a woman more used to caregiving is better 
prepared for life after her husbands death but she takes on a far 
greater than normal burden when nursing a husband through chronic 
illness 
men whose wives die suddenly run a higher risk of dying because 
theyre unable to prepare for unexpected life alone he said men 
tend not to possess the daily living skills that help to preserve 
ones health when she dies suddenly theres a source of support 
thats suddenly gone 
however men adopt caregiver abilities when forced to take 
responsibility for nursing a spouse through chronic illness he 
said 
regardless of how sudden a wifes death said university of 
maryland psychologist leon levy men have much greater difficulty 
with bereavement they dont have the support system women do 
men are more isolated 
jean buchin an adjunct professor at city university of new york 
who conducts workshops for people whose spouses have died said 
smiths study does not consider age the age factor of the 
widowed plays an important role older widows take the impact of 
widowhood sudden or anticipated in general harder 
economically emotionally and socially than younger women 
paul costa head of the laboratory of personality and cognition 
at the national institute of aging in baltimore said his own 
findings show the acute bereavement of the first six months has 
significant effects while longterm grieving has virtually no 
impact on mortality or longterm wellbeing 
smith agrees but puts the maximum impact later you can see 
where the bereavement really kicks in things seem to peak at about 
one year 
he presented his initial findings on widowhood last summer at a 
conference of the society for epidemiologic research and is 
revising the paper for publication by the american journal of 
epidemiology

historians say bowling dates back to ancient 
egypt and while the members of the bnai brith sports lodge have 
witnessed more than a few decades they deny being among the 
original keglers 
no sporadic bowlers the 15 men averaging over 74 years old 
trek to the downtown spencer lanes every tuesday night between 
labor day and passover 
we come through rain and shine even a blizzard once said 
marvin pechter 67 
and they have no plans to quit soon 
i hope to keep at it for another 10 years said charlie 
shayne 85 a printing company manager who prefers bowling to 
almost anything else 
i love it i think you should do what you like summertime i 
play golf wintertime i bowl overnight he plays cards 
give charlie a poker game hell stay up all night long said 
pechter he was late for a tournament once and when he finally 
showed up he said hed been up all night playing poker 
setting up on the last four alleys at spencers the sports 
lodgers bowl quickly chatting and encouraging each other on 
charlie youre up next says pechter 
shayne grabs his bowling ball studies the spots on the alley 
then spryly steps down the approach the leftys ball rolls less 
than halfway down the alley then veers with a little hook into the 
pocket 
boom eight pins down no 6 and no 10 left standing 
shayne gets his ball back from the machine looks again at the 
spots then smoothly moves toward the foul line 
again that little hook bingo a spare 
way to go charlie several other call out 
charlie grins like a kid 
bowling definitely keeps you young you got to keep active 
not watch the boob tube i see too many men vegetate we have 
fun said pechter who runs a hardware store 
the chief funny man in the sports lodge is ed kallish 65 the 
reason we bowl is to get away from our wives or girlfriends or 
both 
the sports lodge is among nearly 4000 senior leagues in the 
united states all with bowlers over 55 said mark miller of the 
american bowling congress 
pechter the league secretary has all the stats we got four 
teams the oldest bowler is 85 our baby is 62 the mean age is 74 
or 75 
the league formed a quarter century ago has some pretty fair 
bowlers 
benny lavin 79 a retired musician who once managed a bowling 
alley averages 174 
i had a 716 series in 1968 said kallish a stationery 
supply salesman 
shayne who started bowling at 46 in 1950 averages 145 
often lavin and some of the others can be seen coaching in 
nearby alleys 
you try to give them a helpful hint if they want it 
pechter said we put a lot of years in were not pros far far 
from it but if we can notice a bowler making a mistake we like to 
give tips 
at the end of the season the sports lodgers party 
we take out our wives out pechter said to thank them for 
letting us bowl

come on over for a bite of supper 
this is the kind of entertaining that is doable 
nothing fancy mind you but an easy inexpensive casserole 
dinner with fresh seasonal greens a crusty bread and dessert 
it can be a pot luck where the host andor hostess prepare the 
main dish and friends bring separate components that make up the 
rest of the meal or if you do it all it can take as little as 
two hours the casserole can go stove top to table top in 30 
minutes and its easy to wash fresh greens for salad whisk 
together a light vinaigrette spread whole wheat baguettes with 
herb butter and whip up a simple dessert 
yet what i so often hear from friends in my travels around the 
country these days is now that the kids have grown up we dont 
entertain much any more or i seldom entertain now that im 
alone this is the very time when entertaining should be at the 
top of our priority list 
whether weve moved to another area from a house to an 
apartment or stayed put entertaining is a conduit through which 
we can share friendship and in opening ourselves up to each other 
we gain perspective encouragement and succor 
people love to go to each others houses and informality is 
often appreciated theres no need to put on the ritz with a 
threecourse dinner and rich dessert light simple food is 
preferred especially at this time of our lives when too many 
calories and too much fat can ruin our efforts to keep fit 
the number of people four or six five or seven singles and 
couples mix and match in both ages and interests 
the cost of this king of entertaining can be as little as 5 a 
person and it enriches our lives beyond measure 
i like to entertain once aa month my friend mary rommer 
says but i dont want to go to that much bother so i make it 
really easy on myself 
use pots platters and ovenware that can come to table plates 
and glasses that can take the heat of the dishwasher runners and 
placemats that dont need ironing foods that dont need looking 
after and casseroles that can sit around in the oven or on top of 
the stove or a big kettle 
i serve just the first time around and then guests can help 
themselves 
heres one of my favorite casserole dinners

a farmer who hires teenagers is quoted 
in a village weekly as saying they come here thinking tomatoes 
grow underground kids coming here to weed have plucked out my 
pepper plants and have planted onions upside down 
should kids know better i wonder i didnt start gardening 
until i was 35 and was so ignorant the first time out i emptied a 
whole packet of lettuce seed into a 6foot row before my horrified 
fatherinlaw could grab my arm 
but my goof didnt dampen my eagerness 
now nearing 74 i make a lettuce packet last four and five 
years and i save wood ashes from the franklin stove to fatten my 
beets ive agonized over frost and drought and the raccoon has 
beaten me time and again to my best corn but learning all the 
time i look with pride at my 20yearold asparagus bed my 
pencilthin french beans and the gloriously red radicchio peeking 
through the mulch and snow on a winter day 
the barefoot boy as john greenleaf whittier pictured him 135 
years ago walked hand in hand with nature and talked to her face 
to face but was he a gardener how many of our teenage children 
garden of their own free will 
and how about vegetables 
i dusted off an old whittier and found that the lad with cheeks 
of tan knew all about woodchucks moles turtles robins orioles 
wasps groundnuts lilies berries and apples but no beans or 
onions in the 102 lines 
did whittier forget the vegetables or in americas pastoral 
age was it quietly understood that vegetables were not a leisure 
activity for children a farmer of our own day reminiscing in the 
new york times about his childhood regrets he never played much 
baseball i had to rush home from school to help my father with 
the planting 
aside from horticultural geniuses like luther burbank many 
gardeners seem to be late bloomers in my own family ive seen my 
son an artist smitten in his mid30s he started because he 
wanted to paint flowers like claude monet but quickly he was deep 
into catalogs and manuals potting soil flats tools trips to 
nurseries cold frames mulches hoses trellises even botanical 
names 
and it doesnt take forever to get pretty good unlike a 
heartless golf ball plants help you they want to live and make 
it as much as you do 
a gallup poll found gardening to be americas leading pastime 
more popular than golf jogging biking tennis and swimming 
but working the soil abounds in irony and paradox on city 
rooftops and backyards amateurs multiply while real farmers once 
a multitude dwindle in the greatest agricultural nation some seek 
loans and therapy even as a few giants achieve miracles of 
production 
astonishing machines with cash the ultimate target spew out 
spotless tomatoes as hard as baseballs and as tasteless while the 
greenest amateur barely knowing enough to water his plants exults 
over his first triumph a juicy tomato with that oldtime flavor 
a thirtyish city friend came to see us at asparagus time 
asparagus is one of mans oldest companions very little different 
in todays cultivated state from the wild spears harvested by our 
forebears my friends eyes widened when he saw the purplish spears 
poking up through the hay mulch selfcontained beauties all ready 
for the cooking pot 
is that how they grow he exclaimed 
i thought i read the pleasure of discovery in his eyes another 
gardener down the road

as the state with the oldest population 
florida offers lessons on dealing with the problems of a graying 
america a demographer says 
the way florida deals with this aging population could be very 
instructive to the nation as a whole when it has to deal with it in 
the year 2020 or 2030 said stanley k smith director of 
population research with the university of floridas bureau of 
economic and business research 
those 65 and older will comprise an estimated 18 percent of 
floridas 13 million residents this year and could hit 26 percent 
by the year 2020 
an older population has a major impact on such things as 
health care child care education the labor force and voter 
participation smith said 
however the growing elderly population is not predicted to be a 
drain on floridas resources as some officials fear in fact he 
said recent studies have shown that the economic benefit of the 
elderly population far outweighs by four or five times its 
demand on the social system 
florida has a unique retiree healthier and considerably 
wealthier than the average for the united states he said 
and there also seems to be some evidence that when they start 
to become really old when they begin placing more demands on the 
social system they often move back to new york or ohio or wherever 
they migrated from

an increase in the number working women 
has hurt aging parents who have traditionally depended on their 
daughters for care says a university of florida researcher and 
author of a new book 
daughters as the caregivers in many families have less time to 
cook and care for their elderly parents said jane myers professor 
of counselor education and author of adult children and aging 
parents 
many women begin or renew careers when their children leave 
home and look forward to a variety of newfound freedoms ms 
myers said the last thing they want is to suddenly have an aging 
parent depending on them 
more elderly people as a result are relying on social service 
programs and perhaps entering nursing homes sooner than they would 
otherwise 
the whole phenomenon of dealing with aging parents is very new 
and its a strain on family members that they arent prepared 
for ms myers said as the parents health becomes fragile and 
they feel vulnerable they want to know that the people they care 
most about are there for them so they may reach out to their 
children more than they used to 
retirement can be especially stressful because they may want to 
get to know their grandchildren and be near their adult children 
who may be busy with their own lives and resent the intrusion ms 
myers said 
another sore spot is the decision to place an aging parent in a 
nursing home between 20 and 30 percent of the elderly population 
can expect to spend some time in a nursing home she said the 
problem with many people who enter nursing homes is that most of 
the time theyre ok and dont need to be there 
another major problem between elderly parents and their adult 
children is that both develop a lifetime of relationship patterns 
that often no longer work as the parents grow old she said 
dont wait until your parents get old and problems arise to try 
to build a good relationship its much easier to deal with trouble 
spots when everyone is healthy

a dividend increase on general motors corps 
class e common stock and a 2for1 split fulfills a promise the 
automaker made when it bought electronic data systems corp six 
years ago 
on monday the gm board of directors authorized the stock split 
and a 17 percent increase in the dividend to 28 cents a share gm 
said the moves stemmed from growth in edss nongm business 
i think it is a good move on the part of gms board said 
analyst terrance quinn of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
even though general motors is having its difficulties its 
living up to its word 
the board also said it was maintaining dividends on gms regular 
common stock keyed to the companys vehiclemaking and marketing 
business and on its class h stock which is related to the gm 
hughes electronics corp subsidiary 
gms nonauto subsidiaries eds gmhughes and general motors 
acceptance corp the groups financing arm are expected to 
report fourthquarter and yearend 1989 earnings next week a day 
later gm will report profits from its vehicle operations which 
are expected to be down sharply from a year ago 
the gm business has not gone anywhere quinn said the 
nongm component has grown in excess of 25 percent annually within 
the last two to three years 
the moves on the class e stock based on eds performance 
indicate that while profits on gms car and truck operations are 
falling other gm businesses are booming 
when gm bought eds from texas billionaire h ross perot in 1984 
it promised that the computer companys performance would not be 
dependent on the automakers overall results it created the class 
e stock to reflect eds performance 
quinn said the dividend increase and stock split are 
reflective of what eds does outside of what gm does 
class e stock has not performed up to its potential because of a 
perception that it is another common class of gm stock quinn 
said 
because its a wholly owned subsidiary theres a feeling that 
there is no independence with it he added 
the increase in the class e dividend to 28 cents a share from 
24 cents also stemmed from an increased profit margin last year 
the company said it will be payable march 10 to shareholders of 
record as of feb 15 
the board said the class e stock split came as the company 
completed a 10 million presplit share repurchase plan gm now 
will repurchase 5 million more shares of class e stock 
the board continued a 75 centashare dividend on the companys 
regular common stock called 1 23 par value and an 18 
centashare dividend on class h stock a year ago the board 
boosted the dividend and declared a 2for1 split on its regular

the government reportedly has offered michael 
milken the chance to plead guilty to six felonies to avoid a 
lengthy trial on new charges but there was no indication the 
former junk bond king would accept a deal 
individuals close to the case said monday they still expect the 
former drexel burnham lambert inc executive to defend his case at 
a trial tentatively scheduled to begin later this year 
the individuals who spoke on condition of anonymity said there 
was no indication milken was considering a plea deal and noted that 
talks between opposing sides are common in complex federal cases 
the case has been in a holding pattern awaiting a new 
indictment superseding the one handed up last march that charged 
milken with 98 counts of fraud and racketeering in connection with 
a series of securities transactions 
prosecutors originally planned to bring the new charges by last 
october the government most recently said the indictment would be 
ready by midjanuary but the reported talks between prosecutors 
and milkens lawyers purportedly caused the latest delay 
milken through his lawyers has proclaimed his innocence and 
pledged to fight the case in court 
the report of a plea offer was published in mondays editions of 
the wall street journal 
prosecutors were said to have offered milken the chance to plead 
guilty to six felony counts each of which would carry a maximum 
five years in prison 
the government would recommend to the judge that milken serve 
the counts concurrently for a maximum of five years or the 
equivalent of one felony charge but a judge would not be bound by 
the recommendation none of the six counts would involve 
racketeering which carries a maximum 20year prison term 
assistant us attorney john carroll did not return a call 
seeking comment on the report 
a spokesman for milken said weve never commented and wont 
start now on the prejudicial and unfair leaks that have been 
printed about this case rather than printing the rumor of the day 
everyone would be better served by waiting for the facts 
the newspaper report said the government offered the plea 
bargain after two weeks of negotiations with milkens lawyers 
a settlement would erase the need for a long and costly trial on 
wideranging securities charges including insider trading that 
could shed new light on one of wall streets most powerful figures 
of the 1980s a trial is expected to include testimony by admitted 
felon ivan boesky the former stock speculator 
reports of a settlement have circulated since milken first was 
linked to the governments insider trading investigation about 
three years ago particularly just before announcements of new 
developments 
the milken camp has maintained in the past that reports of 
developments including a potential settlement or the contents of a 
new indictment are designed to pressure milken and others into 
cooperating they have accused the government of deliberately 
leaking information and asked a judge to restrain such leaks 
the latest report said a plea could be complicated because 
attorneys for milken have told the government he is unwilling to 
cooperate with the continuing insider trading investigation such 
cooperation is customary in complicated cases 
a deal also likely would have to be reached with milkens 
brother lowell who also was indicted and there is no indication 
that one has been proposed or is likely michael armstrong lowell 
milkens attorney did not immediately return a call seeking 
comment

pan am corp desperately seeking a merger 
partner for more than a year has had its shares boosted by renewed 
speculation of an impending deal to help bail the airline out of 
its financial straits 
pan am stock rose 75 cents to 375 a share a 25 percent surge 
in heavy trading monday on the new york stock exchange 
market watchers attributed the jump to weekend comments by 
william f genoese director of the teamsters airline division 
genoese said pan am management had leaked word that a major 
announcement probably a deal with northwest airlines would come 
out of its board meeting today 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon confirmed that the airlines 
board has a regularly scheduled meeting today but she declined to 
comment on the speculation bob gibbons a spokesman for northwest 
at its headquarters in eagan minn also declined to comment 
a combination with a stronger carrier or a sale of some routes 
could pull pan am out of its financial difficulties analysts said 
monday 
they need to do something said andrew geller an airline 
analyst at provident national bank in philadelphia 
geller and other analysts cited rumors circulating in financial 
quarters that short of merging with northwest pan am might strike 
a deal to sell some of its prized transatlantic routes or other 
assets to the carrier 
new yorkbased pan am the nations eighthlargest airline has 
lost nearly 2 billion since 1981 and is saddled with 841 million 
in debt 
last february pan am chairman thomas plaskett said the airline 
needed to merge with another carrier in order to survive pan am 
offered about 33 billion last may for nwa inc northwests 
parent but was outbid by a 365 billion offer from a group led by 
investor alfred checchi 
pan am with a small domestic route base has an extensive 
network linking new york with major european cities northwest the 
nations fourthlargest carrier serves more than 100 us cities 
but also is strong in the far east 
a combination of the two would create the most extensive 
international route system of any us carrier 
pan am is unlikely to become profitable anytime soon given its 
current strategic direction analyst robert mcadoo of the 
investment firm oppenheimer amp co said in a recent report he noted 
that in recent years pan ams new yorkeurope routes have been 
challenged by competitors offering direct flights to europe from 
newer hubs such as dallas atlanta and charlotte nc 
despite its problems mcadoo said pan am still has salable 
assets to enable it to survive this winter and probably again next 
winter 
the airlines revenue was hit hard by the explosion of flight 
103 over lockerbie scotland in december 1988 which scared away 
many potential transatlantic passengers but the situation has 
improved in recent months with passenger traffic up 15 percent 
last december from a year earlier 
pan ams passenger load factors improved to an average 578 
percent in november and 628 percent in december 
but fare cuts and increased costs have raised the breakeven 
level for each flight to around 73 percent of capacity analysts 
estimate 
pan ams cash balance was about 200 million at the end of last 
year ms hanlon said 
the airline which was founded in the 1920s by the legendary 
juan trippe had become the object of a number of suitors in 1987 
including investors kirk kerkorian sir james goldsmith and real 
estate developer donald trump 
a proposed takeover by braniff inc collapsed in february 1988 
when braniff failed to win agreements for costcutting labor 
concessions from pan ams pilots union

the biggest obstacle to eastern airlines 
successful climb from bankruptcy is an atmosphere of confrontation 
rather than compromise a courtappointed overseer says 
theres got to be some give and take on both sides david 
shapiro the carriers bankruptcy examiner said monday 
if the parties put the public interest first and their own 
selfish interests second then eastern is a viable airline 
shapiro said it is totally irresponsible to presume 
liquidation or sale are the only alternatives for the miamibased 
airline which he termed eminently reorganizable 
shapiros comments were contained in a statement announcing 
court approval of a 105 million program to guarantee that any 
passengers and travel agents seeking refunds will be paid 
recently rumors have circulated that texas air corp chairman 
frank lorenzo easterns owner would opt for a chapter 7 
liquidation 
eastern set up the refund program to allay any fears of 
liquidation the new york times reported in todays editions 
ticket sales have fallen since the liquidation talk surfaced the 
newspaper reported 
the ticket refund program approved monday would cover 
ticketholders and travel agents who made purchases after eastern 
filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last march 9 those 
who bought tickets issued before the filing remain under bankruptcy 
court jurisdiction 
meanwhile eastern has agreed to hire back 215 union flight 
attendants by april 1 as part of an accord in which the union 
agreed to drop a lawsuit challenging the jobs of 215 recruits hired 
during the strike 
both sides had to compromise but this was something we could 
live with said mary jane barry president of local 553 of the 
transport workers union which represents flight attendants at 
eastern 
the union walked out march 4 in sympathy with the machinists 
union which remains on strike the flight attendants called off 
their strike on nov 23 
ms barry said terms of the agreement with eastern were 
described in a letter sent friday to the carriers flight 
attendants 
also under the agreement 
eastern agreed the union will continue to represent all eastern 
flight attendants and that all future hiring will come from a 
seniority list 
eastern will turn over to the union some 340000 in dues 
collected from flight attendants working since the strike began 
the union will drop around 215000 in claims from a 
longstanding dispute over pay to union representatives while on 
union business 
of the 3600 flight attendants now working for eastern about 
half were hired after the strike began the others are veterans who 
crossed the picket lines 
the union and eastern still must agree on a new contract to 
replace the previous one which expired in 1988 
negotiations are continuing with the pilots union which ended 
its sympathy walkout just before the flight attendants 
because of easterns downsizing as it strives to emerge from 
chapter 11 the number of former strikers who will get their jobs 
back is in doubt 
the company blackmailed the flight attendants said frank 
ortis president of the machinists local there are still 3000 
of them out of work and it looks like they are pretty well broke

sci television inc has completed a debt 
exchange offer that will enable the tv station operator to avoid 
being forced into bankruptcy court proceedings 
the denverbased company which had been unable to meet interest 
payments on its buyoutrelated debt has been trying for months to 
negotiate an exchange under which its bank and bond lenders would 
get an equity stake in the company 
i think the bondholders got a fair deal said wilbur ross a 
senior managing director at rothschild inc which was financial 
advisor to a group of major sci bondholders he spoke monday as the 
debt exchange was being completed 
the deal reduces the stake held by controlling investor george 
gillett to 41 percent from 55 percent it also cuts the sci stake 
held by a group led by buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co to 15 percent from 45 percent 
a key reason why most bondholders accepted the plan was that 
gillett and kohlberg contributed more value to the resolution of 
the problem than anybody ever has in resuscitating a failed lbo 
ross said 
in an effort to reduce its debt to manageable proportions sci 
wanted to get at least 85 percent of 100 million in 16 percent 
senior subordinated debentures tendered under terms of an exchange 
offer 
those tendering debt would get new debt securities and stock in 
the company in return for their bonds 
although it failed to come up with the 85 percent goal by a 
monday afternoon deadline the company said a federal bankruptcy 
court judge in delaware ruled that the difference between the 
target and the 839 percent the company actually received was not 
material 
as a result the company said the judge dismissed an involuntary 
bankruptcy petition against sci that had been filed by a small 
group of bondholders 
sci television was created in 1987 and consists of the six 
television stations once owned by storer communications kohlberg 
kravis led a leveraged buyout of storer in 1985 and sold the tv 
stations to the new company for 13 billion 
but sci has had trouble generating enough cash from station 
operations to pay the interest on its debt 
it failed to make a 153 million principal payment on its 650 
million in bank debt in october and subsequently missed an 
interest payment on its 507 million in publiclyheld bond debt 
on oct 25 sci announced a restructuring plan under which its 
bondholders would exchange their securities for more debt and stock 
in the company 
in midnovember a group of three sci television creditors 
unhappy with the plan filed a petition in federal bankrupcty court 
in delaware to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy 
the petition was filed on behalf of sn phelps amp co and two 
individuals who hold about 180000 in sci bonds and were owed 
about 15000 in interest 
in december sci proposed a revised debt restructuring plan 
under which gilletts stake would fall to 41 percent and kohlberg 
kravis stake would drop to 15 percent bondholders would get a 39 
percent stake in the company and bank lenders would get 5 percent 
in addition to giving up much of its equity in the company ross 
said kohlberg kravis cancelled a 160 million note it was owed 
kohlberg kravis and gillett chipped in another 20 million each by 
contributing their interest in a leasing company that owned the 
antenna and other equipment used by the sci stations ross said 
sci television operates stations wsbk in boston wjbk in 
detroit wjw in cleveland waga in atlanta knsd in san diego and 
witi in milwaukee

billionaire investor harold c simmons says 
the securities and exchange commission is looking into his 
acquisitions of lockheed corp and georgia gulf corp stock but he 
said the probe was routine and wouldnt interfere with his plans 
simmons announcement came as lockheed reported a fourthquarter 
loss of 109 million and the board of the defense contractor 
affirmed the companys rejection of a request by simmons for a seat 
on the board 
in a filing with the sec on monday simmonscontrolled companies 
stated that the probe apparently centered on the timing of their 
filing of public disclosure documents regarding acquisition of the 
stock 
but simmons poohpoohed it all as a routine investigation with 
which he was cooperating 
simmons said he expected the governments questions to center on 
whether he intended to mount a takeover of lockheed from the time 
he acquired a major interest in the company last april 
on monday simmons launched a 11 billion takeover bid for 
georgia gulf and said he planned to dump the atlanta chemical 
concerns board 
on friday he said he might seek control of lockheeds board of 
directors after the calabasas califbased defense contractor 
rebuffed his bid for representation on the board 
in mondays public filing simmons stated the sec is 
conducting a private investigation regarding trading in certain 
securities of lockheed and an undisclosed second company 
simmons sec filing said the agency had issued subpoenas 
requesting documents and testimony 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue declined comment 
in an interview with the associated press in dallas simmons 
confirmed that the second company was georgia gulf 
im primarily the one being investigated simmons said 
weve always filed those disclosure documents promptly and 
told exactly what we knew at the time he said we think this 
is routine and we think nothing will come of it 
according to the filing the simmonscontrolled companies that 
have acquired lockheed stock 189 percent as of friday said the 
investigation focused primarily on the adequacy of disclosures in 
statements to the sec and the timeliness of such filings 
those filings sec forms known as 13ds require an individual 
or entity to publicly disclose their stockholdings in a company 
with 10 days after those holdings total 5 percent or more of the 
companys outstanding shares 
therell be depositions taken later this week and i think 
well be able to answer all those questions said simmons 
simmons said sworn statements are to be given by him by mike 
snitzer president of valhi inc simmons major holding company 
and by one of simmons stock traders

lockheed corp reported a fourthquarter loss 
of 109 million as directors of the hardpressed defense contractor 
endorsed a decision rejecting billionaire harold c simmons 
attempt to get a seat on the board 
the results announced monday came as little surprise to 
analysts who predicted a large loss back in november after 
lockheed announced it would take a 300 million writeoff because 
of unexpected design changes on a new navy plane 
lockheeds common stock dropped 75 cents to 3812 a share in 
composite trading on the new york stock exchange monday meaning 
that simmons paper loss on his 189 percent stake in the company 
continued to grow 
the simmonscontrolled investor group nl industries has bought 
stock at prices ranging from about 39 to 48 a share 
analyst said they will be watching to see whether the drop in 
the stock price increases simmons resolve to get more control over 
the calabasasbased military contractor 
simmons revealed in securities and exchange commission filings 
that he wants representation on the board 
lockheed chairman daniel m tellep has opposed such a move and 
the company issued a statement saying its board had endorsed the 
rebuff at a regularly scheduled meeting monday 
simmons was not available for comment after business hours 
on paper this man has lost a great deal of money i could 
understand why he would want more of a say in the company 
patricia trent an analyst with seidler amdec said of simmons 
lockheed maker of the radarevading stealth fighter reported 
monday that net income for 1989 fell to 2 million or 3 cents a 
share compared with 624 million or 1037 a share in 1988 
sales fell to 989 billion from 1043 billion 
the 1988 results included a 202 million gain on the sale of 
lockheeds dialog information services unit 
earnings for 1989 were pulled down by the fourthquarter loss of 
109 million or 172 a share compared with earnings of 104 
million or 175 a share a year earlier sales in the latest 
quarter rose to 303 billion from 294 billion a year earlier 
basically this is pretty much as telegraphed said wolfgang 
demisch at ubs securities in new york 
lockheed announced in november that it would take a 300 million 
pretax writeoff because of design changes on the p7a a 
submarinehunting airplane 
development costs on the plane rose because its design will be 
less like that of its predecessor the p3c orion than expected 
lockheed said the company said it still expects to turn a profit 
once p7a production begins

president bush is moving too slowly on the 
global warming problem say environmentalists who contend he 
worries too much about industry and not enough about possible 
environmental disaster in the next century 
bushs speech to an international conference on global warming 
monday included more talk about economics than the 
environment said daniel becker of the sierra club calling the 
presidents remarks a gross disappointment 
the administration was likely to get a better reception today 
when william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
appeared before a senate committee to endorse the creation of a 
cabinetlevel department of the environment 
while that decision is gaining bush plaudits among 
environmentalists his remarks on global warming prompted sharp 
criticism 
sen albert gore dtenn a frequent critic of the 
administrations environmental record accused the president of 
moving as slow as molasses on concerns by many scientists that 
manmade pollution accumulating in the atmosphere threatens to 
significantly warm the earth by the middle of the next century 
what were hearing is talk of another year of waiting i 
expected a lot more concern about the global warming problem 
said rafe pomerance of the world resources institute 
bush speaking to the 60nation intergovernmental panel on 
climate change said our policies must be consistent with 
economic growth he complained that in some areas of the debate 
over the greenhouse effect politics and opinion have outpaced 
the science 
our goal continues to be matching policy commitments to 
emerging scientific knowledge and a reconciling of environmental 
protection to the continued benefits of economic development the 
president said promising to convene a white house conference on 
global warming in the spring 
james tripp a lawyer for the environmental defense fund said 
bush failed to demonstrate the political will necessary to make 
the united states a leader in the effort to prevent global 
warming 
but tom lambrix head of the global climate coalition an 
industry group called bushs view of global warming an 
appropriate balance 
we need a better understanding of the economic and social 
implications of dealing with global warming said lambrix 
director of government relations for the phillips petroleum co 
the united nationssponsored conference of technical experts is 
meeting to work on a proposed treaty to deal with global warming 
reilly issued a statement saying the presidents remarks made 
clear his determination to lead the world in addressing global 
climate change 
bush does not believe it is time for a call to arms on 
global warming but instead favors continued research presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters after the presidents 
remarks 
but many environmentalists argue there is enough scientific 
evidence to warrant a commitment from the united states and other 
industrial nations to reduce global warming gases especially 
carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels 
scientists fear such an accumulation of manmade pollutants will 
act like a greenhouse trapping heat and reflecting it back to 
earth causing a warming of the globe scientists disagree on how 
severe the warming will become or its effect although some 
scientists predict droughts in some interior regions and coastal 
flooding because of higher ocean levels 
reducing greenhouse gases would require less reliance on coal 
oil and natural gas and would require industry to develop more 
energyefficient automobiles and industrial plants which industry 
fears could result in widespread economic disruption

an early retirement offer extended by u s west 
inc has been accepted by some 3850 managers and the final tally 
is expected to hit 4000 says dick mccormick company president 
this action balances the companys need to reduce its costs 
with our commitment to treat these valued employees fairly 
mccormick said monday 
u s west gave the managers a jan 31 deadline to apprise the 
company of their plans but several hundred employees were given 
extensions for varying reasons 
by noon monday the company had received about 5700 responses 
with slightly more than twothirds opting for early retirement 
said spokesman dick macknight 
as of sept 30 u s west and its subsidiaries had 23651 
managers 21735 of them in companies participating in the early 
retirement plan those who opted to stay face the possibility of a 
layoff 
were going to size this organization appropriately for the 
market demand said steve lang another u s west spokesman 
that means were constantly looking and making adjustments 
trimming management positions could be part of that adjustment 
an inhouse announcement of the early retirement program said 
there probably will be management layoffs in 1990 and that 
involuntary separations lay ahead 
u s west communications u s west incs largest subsidiary is 
conducting the study that will determine where a surplus of 
management exists 
since american telephone amp telegraphs court ordered divestiture 
in 1984 u s west has increased its management staff by nearly 
4000 partly through the acquisition and creation of subsidiaries 
as well as a loose classification of management jobs 
the early retirements should fuel cost savings in the companys 
telecommunications business mccormick said in a news release 
the company reported a 24 percent decline in earnings per share 
from 1988 to 1989 the early retirements are expected to help u s 
west achieve earning goals in 1990 and beyond he said 
we plan to invest a significant portion of the savings in long 
term projects that will allow us to serve our customers even 
better he said

automakers pared their newcar inventories 
sharply last month by cutting production and offering incentives 
giving them room to boost manufacturing schedules somewhat to 
prepare for spring 
the eight major us automakers on monday reported a 15 percent 
decline in car and truck sales during late january a 66 percent 
drop in car sales during jan 2131 was offset largely by an 81 
percent increase in light truck sales 
analysts said the figures were better than they appeared because 
sales in the yearearlier period were inflated by a special factor 
during all of january when general motors corp ford motor co 
and chrysler corp shut down assembly and supplier plants for at 
least a week at a time combined car and truck sales by the eight 
domestic makers were up 62 percent from january 1989 
sales of imported cars and trucks fell 61 percent in january 
it looks like we just went from 97 days worth of supply on 
december 31 to about 65 at the end of january said analyst 
charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york city sales have 
run 80 percent ahead of production 
thats something ive never seen before in a january period 
he added 
automakers usually let inventories build a little in february as 
they prepare for what usually is an increased buying pace in march 
and april 
the key now is how you manage it brady said you nudge up 
production and nudge back incentives and find a happy medium 
many of the big three plants that were shut down in january are 
returning to production this month 
but in march gm and chrysler will make some permanent cuts by 
slowing line speeds eliminating shifts or in the case of gms 
atlanta assembly plant shutting down an entire factory 
indefinitely all told the two companies have announced indefinite 
layoffs that will idle about 15400 workers at 11 plants between 
january and september 
incentives last month appeared to be most effective in boosting 
truck sales especially chrysler minivans the nations no 3 
automaker on dec 15 offered cash rebates and lowinterest 
financing for the first time on its dodge caravan plymouth voyager 
and chrysler town and country minivans 
the incentives on the minivans ended last wednesday but 
chrysler has continued the offers on other cars and trucks 
results in late january 1989 were inflated somewhat by heavy 
fleet sales a condition analysts said made this years late 
january figures look relatively encouraging 
typically a large percentage of january and february car sales 
go to fleets including auto rental companies and large 
corporations but this year because of severe cuts in production 
last month fleet deliveries were put off 
january a year ago was an especially strong fleet sales month 
for ford said robert rewey vice president for ford motor cos 
north american automotive operations due to downtime at a number 
of our plants in the early part of this january assembly and 
shipment of many fleet units was delayed 
chrysler said its latejanuary truck sales rose 427 percent 
from sales during the same time last year for all of january 
chryslers truck sales were up 397 percent from january 1989 
gms truck sales rose 68 percent in late january and 118 
percent for the whole month ford said its truck sales fell 82 
percent during the period and 1 percent for the month

georgia gulf corp facing a 11 billion bid 
from texas investor harold simmons said today its board is 
considering the offer and will recommend by the end of the week 
whether shareholders should accept or reject the proposal 
nl industries inc a chemical supply company controlled by 
simmons began a 45 a share tender offer today for the 91 percent 
of georgia gulf it does not already own 
nl said monday it was also planning a proxy fight aimed at 
replacing the atlanta chemical makers board of directors with a 
slate of candidates more sympathetic to nls position 
georgia gulf chairman james r kuse said in a letter to 
shareholders today the companys board and legal advisers were 
considering simmons bid 
the board of directors encourages you to defer your decision 
whether to accept or reject nl industries offer until you have had 
the benefit of and reflected on the companys recommendation 
kuse said 
simmons has been eyeing georgia gulf since last summer but the 
atlanta company in january launched a recapitalization plan 
apparently designed to fend off simmons the value of that plan has 
been estimated by georgia gulf at about 55 a share 
houstonbased nl announcing its tender offer last week said it 
was pursuing the acquisition because company officials believed the 
recapitalization under current market conditions would yield less 
than 45 a share

the bush administration today sent congress a 
package of recommendations for new farm legislation but did not 
spell out how commodity programs should be reduced in order to meet 
federal spending cutbacks next year 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told a news conference the 
proposals dealt only with farm policy and did not address budget 
problems 
he said if all the proposals were approved they would have 
nominal impact on consumer food prices 
one of the most controversial items facing the administration is 
how to cut fiscal 1991 commodity spending by 15 billion a level 
included in the budget proposals president bush sent to congress 
last week 
however the budget message said only that the white house is 
prepared to work closely with lawmakers on the 15 billion 
reduction in commodity programs 
yeutter said administration policymakers do not intend to 
make specific recommendations on how to cut programs by 15 
billion but will work that out with congress when the time comes 
he is scheduled to testify before the senate agriculture committee 
on wednesday 
between 60 and 70 specific recommendations were submitted to 
congress about 90 percent of which will require legislation he 
said 
yeutter said the administrations plan calls for greater 
production flexibility and decisionmaking by farmers allowing 
them greater choice on crops to grow under annual commodity 
programs 
the package also included a recommendation for eliminating the 
departments federal crop insurance corp which provides 
subsidized allrisk coverage to farmers and replacing it with 
permanent disaster assistance 
but yeutter said the administration would listen to congress in 
case there an alternate solution is sought 
another major question is what to do with the departments 
federal crop insurance corp which provides subsidized allrisk 
coverage to farmers 
the agency has been losing money for many years with many 
farmers spurning the insurance and relying on congress to bail them 
out with emergency legislation in case of drought floods and other 
disasters 
yeutter says farmers cant have it both ways and that one or the 
other of the programs insurance or emergency aid has to go the 
bush budget recommended scrapping the insurance program in the 1991 
fiscal year that will begin oct 1 
the administration decided some time ago not to send a formally 
drafted farm bill to capitol hill to succeed the 1985 law that will 
expire at the end of the 1990 crop season instead a series 
concept papers or guidelines has been prepared 
yeutter and others have lauded the food security act of 1985 
the current farm law for helping make us commodities more 
competitive in world trade thus enhancing the nations export 
position 
the 1985 law has helped with its authority for lowering federal 
price supports and targetprice benefits due farmers the bush 
budget said there could be substantial savings if these declines 
were continued or even accelerated by the 1990 farm bill 
we must make certain that our commodity programs have enough 
flexibility to allow farmers to grow crops that consumers want 
instead of crops that the government dictates yeutter said 
monday 
this in concert with a stronger us trading stance in world 
markets for agricultural commodities and products will go a long 
way toward keeping the agrarian economy robust he told the 
national rural electric cooperative assn in orlando fla 
most major farm organizations have already taken stands on some 
of the major issues involved in 1990 farm legislation 
the american farm bureau federation for example has been a 
strong supporter of the 1985 laws emphasis on greater market 
orientation by setting price supports in line with domestic and 
global competition 
a federation position paper distributed monday called for 
maintaining the general direction set by the 1985 farm law it 
also urged greater acreage flexibility under federal commodity 
programs 
the federation said price support loan rates which act as a 
market floor for major crops such as wheat and feed grains should 
continue to be tied to a percentage of the average price of the 
commodity over the past several years 
but the federation said target prices used to compute 
deficiency payments to farmers when markets falter should be 
frozen at 1990 levels 
additional reductions would result in an unacceptable lowering 
of farm income the federation said 
the national farmers union says the 1990 farm bill should 
provide government muscle to sustain familysize farm operation 
promote environmentally safe stewardship of the land provide 
nutrition assistance for lowincome citizens and enhance the 
viability of rural communities 
generally the nfu favors supply management concepts not the 
looser marketoriented themes sought by the administration and 
the farm bureau 
for example the nfus own farm bill would tie the target price 
of wheat to the full cost of production plus a reasonable rate 
of return on a commodity base which will sustain a familysized 
unit

lotus development corp went to federal court 
today to prove that two competitors copied its popular business 
spreadsheet program in a suit that could clarify copywrite laws for 
computer software 
lotus which says its lawsuit aims to protect computer 
innovations began the case by demonstrating its lotus 123 
program to the court 
using video screens the company showed the basic steps for 
setting up financial statements graphs and mortgage projections by 
inserting numbers into various columns and rows 
lotus filed suit in 1987 against paperback software 
international of berkeley calif and mosaic software of 
cambridge claiming a copyright infringement of the look and 
feel of lotus popular 123 program 
the case centers on what protection should be given to images 
that appear on a computer screen and the commands associated with 
the program known as the user interface 
a lot of people are looking at the case to make a decision on 
the issue said ned saltzberg a boston lawyer and editor of the 
computer law newsletter 
legal experts say the inner workings of the program are 
protected by copyright laws but lotus argues that the computer 
screen display constitutes an expression of an idea and thus falls 
under copyright protection 
lotus is alleging these companies copied keystroke for 
keystroke the spreadsheet modules for 123 said bryan simmons 
a spokesman for the cambridgebased company 
the 123 menus provide users with options such as file 
print copy and combine and keyboard buttons are 
punched to activate those options 
paul gupta a lawyer representing paperback software said 
what appears on a menu does not constitute expression where 
youve got a simple list of words on a screen its not enough to 
call it copyrightable 
gupta said paperback software to some extent had its hands 
tied in the development of its vpplanner spreadsheet program in 
order to make a product that is compatible with lotus 123 the 
company had to use technologies that result in similar computer 
images and commands he said 
where we had the opportunity to make changes we did he 
said 
in fact paperback software says by building on lotus system 
the company was following a pattern in the computer industry in 
which borrowed ideas have led to innovations 
adam osborne president of the company noted that lotus modeled 
123 after a previous program visicalc and he said his firm has 
made further improvements 
they had to hobble us with legal processes he said 
officials at mosaic software were not available for comment 
monday 
but simmons at lotus said a ruling in his companys favor 
would not stifle innovation but would do the opposite 
without the copyright protection an entrepreneur might not 
experiment with new products for fear that a big company will 
swallow up the idea he said 
lotus believes this will encourage innovators to take risks 
simmons said 
also he said companies can use the idea of a business 
spreadsheet but do not need to copy each others material in order 
to compete other spreadsheets such as microsoft excel are very 
different from our product he said 
it comes down to are you building on an idea or building on 
an expression of an idea he said 
lee gesmer a partner with the boston law firm of lucash gesmer 
amp updegrove which publishes the technology law bulletin said he 
expects lotus to win the case based on recent similar decisions 
but perhaps more importantly saltzberg said the case should 
give software designers a better idea of what is and isnt 
permissible 
as long as the rules are clear people can abide by them he 
said

virgin atlantic airways announced tuesday it is 
introducing completely nonsmoking flights between new york and 
london starting may 18 
virgin owned by british entrepreneur richard branson said it 
is the first airline to offer such service between the two cities

prompted the move 
other transatlantic carriers are also considering nonsmoking 
flights

virtually all us domestic flights effective feb 25 
international flights however usually offer smoking sections 
this is the first clear alternative to nonsmoking sections 
which are never completely satisfactory for todays 
healthconscious traveler virgin said in a statement 
the airline said it will introduce a second flight between 
newark nj and gatwick airport outside london on thursdays 
fridays saturdays and sundays to accommodate the new nonsmoking 
service virgin will continue to offer smoking and nonsmoking 
sections on its other daily flights to london out of newark and 
john f kennedy international airport in new york

service later to its flights to and from tokyo los angeles miami

sometimes you have to watch what you say 
because people might take you too seriously 
for several years the national association of realtors has 
promoted the idea particularly through its socalled 
affordability index that houses are unaffordable for a large 
percentage of potential buyers 
the index is a product of five financial elements involved in 
owning a house the most important of them being median household 
income the median price of the typical singlefamily home and 
the level of interest rates 
if prices and interest rates rise while income remains the same 
or falls or even if income rises but not sufficiently to offset 
increases in other factors affordability is said to fall 
in december for instance the index measured 1082 up from 
1055 in november boosted to that level mainly by declines in 
mortgage rates since then rates have risen januarys index seems 
destined to fall 
its the declines that create the problems because they suggest 
that good sound american families are being denied the right to 
live as good average american families the issue is almost a 
sacred one 
never mind that at 1082 the december index meant a family 
earning the national median of 33600 had 1082 percent of income 
needed to qualify for a conventional mortgage of 80 percent on a 
home priced at 92500 
many housing people find the measure useful as a trend 
indicator but many buyers and sellers even realtors and 
sometimes the media make a different interpretation they stress 
the unaffordability aspect of the index 
the index does suggest for example that while your family 
might be close to typical in income you still might not be able to 
afford a typical house if local prices are higher than the national 
median 
it also says that millions of other american households cannot 
qualify for the typically priced house because 50 percent of them 
dont earn as much as the median income when the index falls that 
aspect is heavily stressed 
in the past in fact it was stressed very heavily by the 
realtors especially when issues affecting housing were discussed 
in washington and particularly when the index dropped below 100 
as in 1983 and 1984 
at times the unaffordability of housing was promoted by various 
housing and real estate groups as a national disgrace as something 
that demanded immediate correction perhaps through the tax system 
other groups have since picked up the cry and the issue of 
affordable housing is a huge one now and generally the stress 
is on the lack of affordable housing it is a widespread 
perception often accepted uncritically 
many americans who otherwise feel typical now are convinced 
housing is beyond their financial reach some have become market 
dropouts ignoring the fact that thousands of houses are available 
for under the typical price 
in response a grass roots campaign has begun in the northeast 
where prices are relatively high and the unaffordability attitude 
is entrenched its called yes you can meaning yes you can 
buy a home 
it seems destined to spread it originated in springfield mass 
in 1982 when high interest rates undermined the market big 
inventories convinced the greater springfield association of 
realtors to resurrect the campaign in 1989 
iy has now been adopted in new jersey where the state 
association says it plans to spend 250000 in the media and on 
billboards to promote its own campaign yes you can buy a house 
in new jersey 
in the realtors national trade paper realtor news which 
carries the index a member states that the industry has to change 
consumer perceptions about unaffordability 
the member explained that many are not hearing from the press 
that affordable homes and financing are available

united telecommunications inc said 
tuesday its profit declined sharply during 1988s fourth quarter 
but that its revenue jumped 15 percent thanks mostly to continued 
growth at its us sprint longdistance phone company 
profit was hurt by the comparison with a strong 1988 fourth 
quarter when united telecom reported an aftertax gain of 369 
million from the sale of its cellular phone and paging operations 
but profit from continuing operations grew the company said to 
1014 million from 107 million during the fourth quarter of 1988 
united telecom had net profit of 1014 million or 48 cents a 
share in the fourth quarter compared with 3795 million or 
185 a share during the same period of 1988 
revenue for the quarter jumped to 2 billion compared with 17 
billion during the same period a year earlier 
for all of 1989 profit fell to 363 million down from 509 
million in 1988 also because of the sale of the cellular and 
paging units the company said 
for the year overall revenue jumped to 75 billion from 65 
billion in 1988 
us sprint communications co the nations thirdlargest 
longdistance company with about 8 percent of the domestic market 
reported fourthquarter revenue of 12 billion 28 percent more 
than the 930 million reported in the fourth quarter of 1988 it 
was the companys third straight quarter of billiondollar sales 
sprints fourthquarter operating income jumped to 81 million 
compared with an operating loss of 176 million in 1988s fourth 
quarter 
for the year sprint had operating income of 227 million 
compared with a 1988 operating loss of 386 million operating 
revenue for 1989 totaled 43 billion up 27 percent from 1988s 
34 billion 
we have every reason to believe the progress in our 1989 
performance will continue into 1990 said william t esrey 
president and chief executive officer of united telecom 
he noted that sprints fourthquarter revenue reflected only 
minimal impact from a contract the company won last year to provide 
40 percent of a new telephone system for the federal government 
esrey has said that the federal government soon will be sprints 
largest customer 
in addition to its 80 percent ownership of sprint kansas 
citybased united telecom owns companies that provide local phone 
service in the south and midwest the rest of sprint is owned by 
gte corp

the interim government on tuesday 
announced a sharp devaluation of the lei and set a single exchange 
rate aimed at better reflecting the currencys real value and 
helping repair decades of chaotic monetary policies 
the devaluation also was aimed at spurring exports by making 
romanian products relatively cheaper in foreign markets 
the ruling executive bureau of the national salvation front set 
new exchange rates against hard currencies pegged to a dollar rate 
of 21 lei 
the previous rates were 874 lei to the dollar for 
noncommercial transactions and 1423 lei for commercial 
transactions 
however the official rate remains below black market dollar 
rates now averaging about 80 lei 
the currency decree dated feb 1 was not published until 
tuesday when the new list of exchange rates appeared in the 
newspaper romania libera the decree said it was aimed at 
rectifying an abnormal situation and making the leis value 
more realistic 
the devaluation was announced less than 24 hours after the 
executive bureau which has been running the country since dictator 
nicolae ceausescu was toppled dec 22 issued another decree 
legalizing free enterprise on a much larger scale than existed 
during 45 years of communist rule 
the decree the most farreaching consumeroriented measure 
since decembers revolution will allow the existence of 
profitmaking businesses with up to 20 employees under the old 
system tradesmen could employ only up to three people and taxes 
were punitive 
under ceausescu the dollarlei exchange rate was set 
artificially high in favor of the lei in an apparent attempt to 
have it reflect what the dictator touted as romanias economic 
strength 
the single exchange rate that will replace the previous multiple 
lei rates will be set weekly by the national bank of romania to 
reflect the dollars value on international markets 
the lei rate for other hard currencies will be determined by 
their rate in relation to the dollar for example the west german 
marks rate has increased from 517 lei at the end of january to 
1250 lei starting feb 1 as that currency has strengthened 
against the dollar 
the new decree does not apply to soviet rubles or other 
nonfreely convertible currencies from countries that have 
established bilateral or multilateral agreements with fixed lei 
rates 
the new rates are expected to stimulate exports but imports 
will be more expensive in lei so the government has created a 
special fund to meet the increased cost the newspaper said 
what is important is that internal prices for consumer goods 
will not be changed tourism is thus stimulated the paper said

the dollar finished lower against most major 
currencies in european trading tuesday depressed by broad interest 
in the west german mark and worries about the us treasurys 
quarterly financing operation this week 
gold was lower 
the dollar was quoted at 16570 deutsche marks tuesday 
afternoon down from 16670 late monday in london 
dealers said confidence in the dollar has been shaken by 
uncertainty over japanese interest in sales of 10year and 30year 
treasury securities on wednesday and thursday 
however they said the primary action in the market has been a 
broad return to marks after a bout of shortdollar covering against 
the west german currency 
there was a bit of a short squeeze on the dollar said john 
wastell a corporate dealer at bank of america in london but we 
expect the dollar to stay under pressure the covering has cleared 
room for fresh selling against the mark 
wastell said interest in buying marks against the yen is 
underpinned to some degree by technical factors including the 
marks move through 8715 yen early in the day in late london 
dealings the crossrate was around 8756 yen with some dealers 
predicting a move toward 8780 yen before some profit taking might 
surface 
while the dollar weakened against the yen dealers anticipate 
the us currency will remain firm in the runup to japanese 
national elections on feb 18 
in tokyo the dollar fell 070 yen to close at 14490 yen 
later in london it was quoted at 14510 yen

levels were 14770 swiss francs down from 14780 56405 french 
francs down from 56573 18680 dutch guilders down from 18880 
123500 italian lire down from 123600 and 11874 canadian

opec slashed oil production last month 
but not enough to meet its promised goal according to estimates 
released tuesday 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report that the 13 opec nations produced about 233 million barrels 
of crude oil a day in january that was about 00000 barrels below 
decembers peak levels but still well above the 22millionbarrel 
limit opec pledged late last year 
the bulk of the reduction occurred in saudi arabia kuwait and 
the united arab emirates the report said 
the ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries pledged last november to cut daily production to 22 
million barrels for the first half of 1990 although the ceiling 
was 205 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 1989 actual 
production had reached 24 million barrels a day in december boosted 
by excess flow from saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab 
emirates 
analysts had expected the producing nations to rein in 
production even more in january to try to meet the new production 
cap 
nonetheless the continued brisk flow has not depressed prices 
as some had predicted world oil prices in fact soared early in 
january although they have eased slightly since then 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec was 
1956 a barrel in the last week of january down from 2046 in 
the first week of the month opecs target price is 18 a barrel 
on the futures market west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude has been trading in the range of 22 to 23 a barrel 
higher than the 20 to 21 range in december 
although opecs crude oil output in january has been well 
above the expectations based on the new production ceilings set by 
opec the oil market has not yet shown any significant indications 
of oversupply said the energy agency report 
analysts suggested opec production might even increase 
nick antill analyst at the london firm of county natwest said 
he had a strong suspicion that this months output would show 
little change from january he said there has been no serious 
effort to cut back on production 
pierre terzian editor of the parisbased newsletter 
petrostrategies predicted production would be higher in february 
it is increasing that is undeniable he said 
some analysts believe key producing countries want to keep 
prices around the 18 mark partly to discourage nonopec countries 
from muscling in on their share of the world oil market higher 
prices could attract more producers lower production would likely 
drive up prices some argue given the strong demand conversely 
strong production would tend to weaken them 
the energy agency estimated demand for opec oil would shrink 
from an estimated 227 million barrels a day in the first quarter 
of this year to 198 million barrels in the second three months 
total world demand was estimated at 539 million barrels a day 
in the januarymarch period and 51 million barrels in the 
apriljune period 
the report estimated production by saudi arabia the worlds 
largest crude oil exporter at 53 million barrels a day last 
month in line with its individual output quota for the first half 
of the year 
production by the united arab emirates was estimated at 2 
million barrels a day in january over its cap of 11 million 
barrels kuwaits output was recorded at 17 million barrels above 
its limit of 15 million barrels in december output was put at 
23 million barrels for the uae and 2 million barrels for kuwait 
the agency set irans supply at 29 million barrels a day in 
january and iraqs at 31 million barrels a day each has a quota 
of 31 million barrels 
other estimates for january production were qatar 400000 
barrels a day nigeria 18 million barrels libya 12 million 
barrels algeria 800000 barrels gabon 200000 barrels 
venezuela 19 million barrels ecuador 300000 barrels and 
indonesia 13 million barrels 
the international energy agency is an arm of the organization 
for economic cooperation and development made up of 24 western 
nations

a proud and vital chunk of chicago history goes 
on the auction block this week as bat industries plc opens the 
bidding for the marshall field and co department store chain 
at least half a dozen parties including fields management are 
expected to join the bidding for the 135yearold retailer which 
has 24 stores in four states 
the process begins thursday when the investment firm goldman 
sachs amp co hands out confidential prospectuses to potential 
bidders for both fields and the larger saks fifth avenue chain 
according to a spokeswoman for batus inc a subsidiary of bat 
based in louisville ky 
londonbased bat hopes to announce the winning bids sometime in 
may the spokeswoman said tuesday 
observers have estimated marshall field will fetch 600 million 
to 1 billion while some analysts have estimated that saks could 
fetch upwards of 12 billion 
bat shareholders in october approved a plan to sell the 
companys us retailing operations in a restructuring designed to 
thwart a 217 billion hostile takeover bid led by anglofrench 
financier sir james goldsmith 
bat has owned fields since 1982 
ironically one of goldsmiths backers is frederick w field a 
descendant of fields founder 
fields chairman philip b miller and may department stores co 
have said publicly they want to buy fields others reportedly 
interested in the chain include dillard department stores inc 
dayton hudson corp jmb realty corp and several us investment 
firms representing foreign interests 
the winner will get a thriving determinedly upscale chain that 
commands 15 percent of the crowded chicago retail market despite 
stiff competition from bloomingdales niemanmarcus saks and 
others 
miller moved to fields from the presidents office of 
niemanmarcus in 1983 he engineered a financial turnaround at 
fields overseen an extensive remodeling of the companys flagship 
store on state street and expanded its reach into ohio and texas 
the company also has stores in wisconsin 
the prospective bid by miller in conjunction with a yettobe 
identified partner or partners has fueled hopes that fields will 
be returned to local ownership 
miller declined to comment on the bidding but in an october 
interview with the chicago tribune he pledged to fight for control 
of fields 
the worst scenario would be to have someone come in here and 
treat it like any old department store and have it become just 
another store miller said this is clearly not what chicago 
wants or deserves 
in the interview miller said that under his leadership fields 
annual sales have gone from about 650 million to more than 11 
billion and annual profit has doubled to an estimated 90 million 
in 1989 from 45 million in 1983 
he has concentrated on restoring class to the chain whose early 
motto give the lady what she wants promised customer

gte corp said tuesday its 1989 
fourthquarter earnings rose 20 percent because of strong 
performances by its telephone and telecommunications units 
the company said net income was 392 million or 115 per 
share for the quarter ended dec 31 1989 compared with 326 
million or 96 cents a share in the same 1988 period 
quarterly revenue increased 7 percent to 46 billion from 43 
billion a year earlier 
for the year gte posted earnings of 14 billion or 416 per 
share up from 12 billion or 358 a share in 1988 revenue 
totaled 174 billion up 6 percent from 165 billion the year 
before 
gte said revenue from telephone operations was up 7 percent 
because of higher foreign revenue more telephone use and more 
access lines in service it said the improvements were offset by 
various rate reductions and other charges costing 300 million last 
year 
telephone operations performed exceptionally well in 1989 
james l johnson gte chairman and chief executive officer said in 
a statement he said a reorganization and consolidation announced 
in 1988 is proceeding on schedule 
revenue from telecommunications products and services increased 
9 percent last year with higher sales of cellularmobile phone 
services satellite services government communications systems and 
directory advertising 
gte said its cellularmobile phone unit grew to 263000 
customers in 1989 from 50000 customers 
sales of electrical products fell 2 percent which the company 
attributed to lower prices the sale of some marginal businesses 
and weaker currencies overseas it also said fourthquarter 
operating income was off due to a restructuring

stock prices finished broadly lower today 
although a lateafternoon rally trimmed the losses for the session 
trading activity was moderate picking up the pace from monday 
which was the slowest trading day of the new year 
stock prices had risen in three of the past four sessions after 
sinking for most of the month of january 
some analysts said todays decline was an indication that the 
markets broader trend is still lower 
the prospect of rising interest rates has inhibited recent price 
gains making yields on shortterm treasury securities more 
competitive with those available on stocks and dimming chances for 
corporate earnings growth 
those worries grew more pronounced as the treasurys auction of 
30 billion in new securities approached this week 
in the credit markets today rates edged up on sixmonth 
treasury bills while yields on 30year treasury bonds rose to the 
856 percent level from 853 percent late monday

texas air corp the nations largest airline 
company said tuesday it lost 3628 million in the fourth quarter 
of 1989 as subsidiaries eastern airlines and continental airlines 
both posted losses 
texas airs deficit was widened from a net loss of 2244 
million in the fourth quarter of 1988 
the latest quarterly loss amounting to 917 a share pushed 
texas airs loss for all of 1989 to 2271 a share or 8856 
million a record high for the us airline industry that 
compares with its 1988 loss of 7186 million or 1888 a share 
fourthquarter revenue fell to 17 billion from 2 billion for 
the full year texas airs revenue was 67 billion down from 86 
billion in 1988 
the octoberdecember figures include a 561 million net loss 
for houstonbased continental narrowed from a 992 million loss 
in the fourth quarter of 1988 continentals fourthquarter revenue 
was 12 billion up from 11 billion 
for the year continental turned a 31 million profit 
reversing a 3155 million loss for 1988 fullyear revenue was 
51 billion up from 47 billion in 1988 
we are pleased with continentals strong improvement in 
profitability in 1989 texas air chairman frank lorenzo said in a 
statement in addition given the significantly negative factors 
affecting all airlines in the fourth quarter continental stands 
out as the only major carrier showing marked improvement in 
yearoveryear fourthquarter results 
continentals figures included onetime net gains of 812 
million from asset sales and 106 million in retired debt 
miamibased eastern which is reorganizing under federal 
bankruptcy court supervision showed a fourthquarter net loss of 
2826 million on revenue of 4822 million in the fourth quarter 
of 1988 eastern lost 1017 million on revenue of 8444 million 
for all of 1989 eastern lost 8523 million on revenue of 15 
billion compared with a 1988 loss of 3354 million on revenue of 
38 billion 
easterns unique situation in 1989 obviously had a major 
impact on texas airs consolidated results lorenzo said but 
as eastern finalizes its reorganization plans we are confident 
that a far more competitive airline will emerge 
eastern was hit by a crippling strike last march forcing it 
into chapter 11 reorganization the unions representing pilots and 
flight attendants called off their sympathy walkouts in november 
but the machinists union remains on strike 
the airline has hired mainly nonunion workers to replace the 
strikers and is restructuring as a smaller carrier 
easterns unique situation in 1989 obviously had a major 
impact on texas airs consolidated results lorenzo said but 
as eastern finalizes its reorganization plans we are confident 
that a far more competitive airline will emerge 
eastern management recently proposed to pay unsecured creditors 
only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges 
from bankruptcy protection and another 70 percent over the 
following 10 years without interest in return for accepting 
partial repayment texas air would give the unsecured creditors 40 
percent of easterns equity 
in addition preferred shareholders would receive no more than 
10 cents on the dollar in the form of new stock a committee 
representing preferred shareholders attacked the plan 
easterns fourthquarter losses included a special charge of 
1537 million in back pay to some pilots pension curtailment 
costs and legal expenses for the bankruptcy case

first union national bank on tuesday 
stopped distributing copies of a newsletter that referred to 
germans as huns and japanese as nips in an article 
satirizing fears of foreign investment 
the bank also issued apologies about the article appearing in 
the feb 1 edition of the newsletter which the bank said already 
had been mailed to some 600 of its customers after it received 
media calls asking about the piece 
william r hackney iii first unions chief investment officer 
and the author of the article referred questions to the banks 
public relations staff 
he was trying to satirize american economic weaknesses and he 
deeply regrets his choice of words said first union spokesman 
jeep bryant 
in response to a request for a copy of the newsletter bryant 
said the bank was embarrassed by its content so weve stopped 
distributing it 
the article titled racial overtones refers twice to germans 
as huns and three times to the japanese as nips in what it 
characterizes as a tongueincheek assault on foreign 
investment in the united states 
the article begins the huns and the nips are at it again 
fouling up our capital markets the folks from the lands of teuton 
and nippon jacked up their interest rates sharply in recent months 
dragging our rates along with them 
they yanked the rug out from under our stock and bond 
markets thats the thanks we get for protecting them from the 
russians all these years 
hackney told the news and observer of raleigh on monday that he 
intended to poke fun at us fears of foreign investment in an 
obvious tongueincheek style 
those terms while they are slang are like calling folks in 
the united states yanks he said 
charlottebased first union one of the largest banks in the 
southeast issued an apology monday in response to inquiries from 
the newspaper and bryant reiterated the apology tuesday 
it was not our intention to speak in a derogatory way about 
the german and japanese people he said 
however german and japanese government representatives took 
exception to the article 
hansjochen schmidt of the consultate general of the federal 
republic of germany said the term hun suggested uncivilized 
barbarians 
we wouldnt appreciate being called that he said in a phone 
interview from atlanta 
schmidt also disagreed with hackneys characterization of the 
ethnic terms as slang 
its far more negative he said i cant imagine a bank 
would condone such a characterization banks like first union are 
trying to reach out to the entire world 
the japanese consultate general which oversees cultural and 
business trade in the southeast issued a statement from its 
atlanta office saying while we find the choice of words used in 
the first union newsletter very unfortunate we trust and hope it 
is not representative of the attitude of this region 
bryant said the bank had received only a handful of phone calls 
about the newsletter mostly from the news media

eastman kodak co on tuesday announced a 
loss of 60 million for the final quarter of 1989 due mainly to 
the costs of a restructuring the photographic company began earlier 
in the year 
the loss marked only the third time in kodaks history that it 
has reported red ink 
company officials and industry analysts cautiously predicted 
improved earnings in 1990 as kodak begins to realize savings from 
the restructuring 
the loss which amounted to 19 cents per share compared with 
earnings of 312 million or 96 cents per share in the fourth 
quarter of 1988 
sales for the fourth quarter totaled 489 billion up 8 percent 
from 454 billion in the 1988 period 
fourthquarter earnings were reduced by restructuring charges of 
322 million or 525 million before taxes bringing total charges 
for 1989 to 549 million or 875 million before taxes 
as part of the restructuring kodak sold or consolidated about 
20 businesses and eliminated 7500 jobs during 1989 in united 
states and abroad most through voluntary separation attrition and 
transfers to other businesses 
kodaks earnings for all of 1989 declined 62 percent to 529 
million or 163 per share compared with 140 billion or 431 
per share in 1988 
sales for the year totaled 184 billion up 8 percent from 
1793 billion in 1988 
clearly 1989 was a difficult year for kodak with significant 
expenses related to our restructuring efforts as the most visible 
sign kodak chairman colby h chandler said in a statement 
earnings were further restrained by the impact of general 
inflation on operating costs higher interest expense and the 
unfavorable impact of exchangerate fluctuations he said 
all segments of the company reported increases in quarterly and 
annual sales but information systems earnings dropped for both the 
quarter and the year even without the restructuring costs and 
quarterly earnings from chemical sales also sagged 
quarterly earnings in the health segment which includes 
sterling drug inc increased 15 percent without restructuring 
costs but dropped 9 percent for the year 
without the restructuring costs total kodak quarterly earnings 
would have been 262 million or 80 cents per share down 16 
percent from last year while annual earnings for the year would 
have declined 23 percent to 108 billion or 332 per share 
mark obenzinger an industry analyst with trinity trading co of 
new york said kodak expects to save 450 million to 500 million 
from the restructuring last year those savings should start to 
appear in mid1990 he said but the company will continue to face 
competitive and financial pressures 
theyll have to do even better than that in 1990 and set up a 
momentum that continues into 1991 obenzinger said 
analyst brenda landry of morgan stanley said she thought kodak 
would only manage to save about 350 million landry said she was 
revising her estimate for kodaks 1990 earnings downward from 420 
per share to around 370 or 375 
health care profits will be lower than anticipated and the 
chemical business we know will be falling apart she said 
chandler said he expects things to improve for kodak in 1990 
we look forward to higher sales better earnings from 
operations and improved cash flows especially in later quarters 
when the benefits of initiatives put into place are more fully 
realized he said 
but chandler warned that uncertainties in the us economy 
the down cycle in the chemical industry and a softening in the 
domestic market for office equipment could restrain somewhat 
the gains which might otherwise have been achieved 
the company has had a troubled decade laying off thousands of 
workers in 1983 1986 and 1989 in efforts to turn around sagging 
profits 
the two previous losses recorded by kodak also resulted from 
special charges in 1985 when the company gave up its instant 
photography business and in 1986 when more than 10000 workers were 
laid off in an earlier restructuring

hallmark cards inc on tuesday began an 
offer to buy back at a discount some 270 million in debt 
securities used to finance univision holdings inc under a plan to 
ease the debt burden on the unprofitable spanishlanguage 
broadcaster 
the action by hallmark which owns a 635 percent stake in 
univision followed univisions failure to make 10 million in 
interest payments due last week on some of the debt 
univision the nations largest spanishlanguage communications 
company said it missed the payments because of insufficient cash 
flow 
hallmark issued a statement saying it also was seeking 
concessions on some 315 million in bank loans including a revised 
repayment schedule and increased availability of money 
hallmark which is privately held declined to comment further 
about the offer and referred all questions to thomas m daly jr of 
kekst and co a new york public relations firm daly would not say 
why hallmark was making the offer 
univision owns eight fullpower spanishlanguage television 
stations and the spanishlanguage network univision which has more 
than 500 affiliates 
the company reported a net loss of 316 million for the year 
ended dec 31 1988 the latest annual figures available it had 
1988 revenue of 132 million 
hallmark and a unit of the banking concern first chicago corp 
began their interest in the spanishlanguage communications network 
by acquiring five spanishlanguage stations in 1987 
first chicago now owns 215 percent of univision while hallmark 
owns a 635 percent stake the rest 15 percent is owned by trusts 
of descendants of univisions former owners 
hallmark said it planned to buy back two series of univision 
debt securities offering 30 cents on the dollar for one issue with 
a face value of 105 million and 45 cents on the dollar for a 
second issue with a face value of 165 million 
the original proceeds of those securities issued in july 1988 
were used to repay two loans supplied by hallmark for univision 
acquisitions 
hallmark also said that if the debt restructuring was completed 
it would defer for five years the interest payments due on both 
debt securities 
hallmark also is seeking unspecified concessions from first 
chicago the wall street journal quoted people it said were close 
to the debt negotiations as saying that first chicagos stake in 
univision would be reduced in return for improved prospects that it 
would recoup its investment 
moodys investors service inc and the standard amp poors corp 
two new york rating services lowered their credit ratings on both 
univision debt securities last friday

livestock and meat futures were mostly lower 
gold futures settled 110 to 150 lower with the contract for 
delivery in february at 42130 a troy ounce silver finished 23 
cents to 24 cents lower with march at 533 a troy ounce 
gold for february delivery had surged a total of 10 an ounce in 
the three previous sessions mainly on supportive chart signals

fundamental factor

by similarly sharp increases in silver and platinum prices 
the gold rally passed a milestone monday when the heavily traded 
contract for april delivery moved above 430 an ounce but 
confidence in the market then waned 
bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with the investment firm 
painewebber inc said gold historically has performed poorly in 
february which might account for traders reluctance to keep 
betting on higher prices 
if history serves as a guide i would be on my guard here 
he said 
but another analyst peter cardillo of josephthal amp co said 
uncertainty surrounding stock prices and the political upheaval in 
eastern europe could keep investors interested in gold 
the markets looking at several things so i dont think you 
can just look at the traditional history such as the february 
effect he said 
petroleum futures turned in a mixed performance on the new york 
mercantile exchange ahead of the american petroleum institutes 
weekly inventory report which showed higherthanexpected supplies 
across the board 
the api reported a 77millionbarrel increase in us stocks of 
crude oil a 47millionbarrel rise in gasoline stocks and a

the board on wednesday

cents higher with march at 2251 a barrel heating oil was 15 
cent lower to 24 cent higher with march at 5619 cents a gallon

march at 6188 cents a gallon 
orange juice futures rose sharply on the new york cotton 
exchange reclaiming most of the ground lost monday in a 
technically inspired selloff 
frozen concentrated orange juice settled 205 cents to 5 cents 
higher with may at 1928 a pound 
soybean futures rose modestly on the chicago board of trade amid 
bullish technical signals and signs of stronger foreign demand 
corn futures also advanced while wheat futures retreated 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents lower with march at 
382 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with march at 
237 a bushel oats were cent to cent higher with march at

chicago mercantile exchange while pork futures retreated in line 
with weakening cash markets

percent while sales declined 
it was the companys 129th straight quarter dating back to 
1957 in which profits have increased 
for the threemonth period ended dec 31 emerson earned 1419 
million or 64 cents a share compared with 1368 million or 61 
cents a share a year ago revenue totaled 16 billion down 43 
percent from 17 billion 
the company attributed the sales decline to the divestiture of 
several companies in the last half of the year including daybrite 
an industrial lighting company and five small electronics firms 
the divestiture reduced sales in the quarter by 90 million 
our financial position remains strong said charles knight 
emersons chairman and chief executive officer 
he noted that the company remained one of the few usbased 
manufacturing firms with a triplea credit rating the rating was 
reaffirmed recently after emerson spent 460 million to acquire 
leroy somer a french electric motor maker and 135 million for 
mcgill manufacturing a maker of bearings and industrial electrical 
products 
knight said the companys capital goods divisions which make 
industrial monitoring equipment and machines and components for 
assembly lines and other uses had the best showing in the quarter 
sales were slow in computer support products consumer tools and 
appliance components he said 
emerson is the leading maker of garbage disposals refrigerator 
compressors and uninterruptible power supplies for computers it 
also makes craftsman tools for sears roebuck amp co 
our capital goods related businesses have record level 
backlogs and expect good sales performances in the second 
quarter knight said in a news release 
the results for the st louisbased company which turns 100 
years old this year kick off what company officials hope will be 
emersons 33rd straight year of record profits

month and switch to providing data through electronic information 
systems 
media general financial services a whollyowned subsidiary of 
richmondbased media general plans to shut the financial weekly

tabloid containing investment analyses of various industries the 
combined circulation of the publications is about 3000 
the decision announced monday could affect up to five jobs 
but media general said it would try to place those employees 
elsewhere 
although visonary and unique when they were introduced in the 
early 1970s such weekly or monthly publications have been rendered 
essentially obsolete by the overwhelming use of computers in the 
financial community said dennis h cartwright president and 
chief executive officer of media general financial services 
users of our financial data bases increasingly demand services 
that can only be provided electronically 
cartwright said the division has expanded its ability to provide

threeyear program to convert all data base management systems to 
new computers

yen early wednesday while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange 
edged lower 
the dollar started trading at 14518 yen up 028 yen from 
tuesdays close of 14490 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which gained 
3542 points tuesday shed 1373 points shortly after the market 
opened to move to 3765310 
currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range 
during early trading because the market was focused on 
crosstrading between the yen and the west german mark 
as for dollaryen trading many market players are taking a 
waitandsee position said a dealer with the bank of tokyo who 
spoke anonymously 
the dealer said the less active trading for the dollar was 
partly due to the oneday extension of the soviet communist party 
central committee meeting originally set to end tuesday 
at the meeting soviet leader mikhail gorbachev announced a 
dramatic proposal to terminate the communist partys monopoly on 
power some dealers said the mark was being bought on speculation

when coast guard officers boarded the 
oilspewing exxon valdez and asked skipper joseph hazelwood to 
explain the problem he replied youre looking at it the 
ships radio officer testified tuesday 
james roberson was asked by defense attorney michael chalos to 
interpret hazelwoods remark chalos suggested hazelwood was 
referring to the overall situation on the crippled tanker but 
roberson disagreed 
i took it to mean that he meant himself said the witness in 
hazelwoods trial in the nations worst oil spill 
minutes later roberson said a us coast guard commander came 
to his radio office to use a phone 
i overheard the commander saying i smelled alcohol on his 
breath i want a technician out here roberson recalled 
blood tests on hazelwood taken 10 hours after the tanker ran 
aground showed a bloodalcohol ratio of 061 lower than alaskas 
limit for a driver to be considered legally intoxicated but above 
the federal limit for operating a commercial vessel 
superior court judge karl johnstone suggested out of the jurys 
presence that attorneys were failing to address a critical issue 
whether there was liquor aboard the exxon valdez that night if no 
liquor was found he said it would mean that hazelwoods 
bloodalcohol level might have been much higher earlier in the 
evening 
roberson however was the third crewman to attest that 
hazelwood was sober and clearly in control of the ship and showed 
no signs of drunkeness 
i would describe him as serious calm said roberson who had 
seen hazelwood drinking at a valdez bar earlier in the day 
roberson was preceded on the stand by a marine pilot who 
testified that there was a telltale trace of liquor on hazelwoods 
breath but said the captains judgment seemed unimpaired an hour 
before the tanker hit bligh reef and spilled nearly 11 million 
gallons of crude oil in prince william sound 
the two crew members testimony challenged the prosecutions 
theory that hazelwood had been drinking all day and was not in 
control when the tanker foundered on bligh reef 
under crossexamination by hazelwoods attorney pilot william 
e murphy told jurors he saw none of the usual signs of 
intoxication in the captain when murphy left the ship shortly 
before it ran aground 
did you see anything that indicated the captain was impaired 
in any way asked defense attorney michael chelos 
not at all murphy replied firmly 
murphy said hazelwoods speech was not slurred he also answered 
negatively when asked if hazelwoods movements changed if his eyes 
were watery and if he had a mood change from that afternoon when 
the men had a nonalcoholic lunch together 
he seemed the same to me murphy said 
he added that he observed hazelwood giving orders to his crew 
which seemed clear and seemed in command of his ship 
when questioned monday murphy said he smelled alcohol on 
hazelwoods breath hours before the exxon valdez ran aground 
earlier in the day johnstone refused to let jurors hear about a 
grounding incident a couple months later involving murphy 
in a brief hearing outside the jurys presence murphy said the 
boat which carried 13 schoolchildren ended its journey safely 
because i drove it up on the beach 
murphy acknowledged that even the best mariners occasionally run 
aground but johnstone refused to let jurors hear that saying 
the fact that other mariners may have grounded vessels is not 
probative in this case 
he also declined to let jurors consider the impact of the 
accident on murphys testimony 
on monday murphy recalled joining hazelwood and two other crew 
members for lunch in valdez where their tanker had picked up its 
cargo of oil last march 
after lunch he said he dropped off the captain across the 
street from a bar called the pipeline club and when he next saw 
hazelwood aboard the exxon valdez about eight hours later there 
was the smell of alcohol about him 
while on the bridge did you notice any signs that he had been 
drinking assistant district attorney brent cole asked 
no replied murphy except i smelled something i 
associated with alcohol on his breath 
within 30 minutes he said hazelwood had gone below and 
remained there about an hour while murphy checked the weather 
facing the ship in its tricky passage through the valdez narrows 
its not unusual for masters to leave the bridge said 
murphy but added it wasnt typical to be gone for that long in 
the narrows 
cole had maintained in his opening statement that hazelwood was 
drunk and absent from his post when the tanker crashed onto the 
reef and said hazelwood spent the seven hours before the trip in a 
bar ordering vodka 
hazelwood is on trial on a felony charge of seconddegree 
mischief and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment 
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while 
intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is 
seven years three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
to prove criminal mischief the state must show that hazelwood 
recklessly created a risk of damage to the property of another in 
excess of 100000 
under rules at the time of the exxon valdez accident pilots 
were required to guide outbound ships to a point just short of 
bligh reef 
the rules have been changed to require pilots local boat 
handlers familiar with coastal waters to remain aboard past bligh 
reef
