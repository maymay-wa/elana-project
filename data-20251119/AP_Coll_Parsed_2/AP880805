the pentagon inquiry into the shooting down of 
an iranian civilian jetliner on july 3 is reported to have found 
that human error caused by the stress of firsttime combat was 
a factor in the uss vincennes mistakenly shooting down the plane 
here is a report on the conditions aboard us warships in the 
gulf 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
inexperience isolation and the need for 
a constant state of high alert are factors that contribute to high 
stress aboard the us warships in the persian gulf 
just before the us missile frigate jack williams sailed into 
battle april 18 its skipper cmdr edward mann noted that only 
two among the 225 men aboard had ever been in combat himself and 
his senior chief petty officer 
the statistic is not unusual for a us warship in the persian 
gulf whose crews average about 23 years of age and usually include 
a few 18yearolds away from home for the first time 
navy officers say such factors as inexperience the persian 
gulfs oppressive heat isolation at sea and the demands of staying 
at high alert around the clock add up to a high stress 
situation that can affect performance 
pentagon sources say the investigation of the july 3 shooting 
down of an iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard by the missile 
cruiser vincennes found human error apparently caused by 
stress in firsttime combat led radar operators to mistake the 
a300 airbus for a military attack plane 
it was not the first time in persian gulf operations that radar 
signals have been misinterpreted by radar operators 
in an april 18 clash between us and iranian forces the jack 
williams radar indicated it and two other warships were under 
attack by iranian silkworm antiship missiles the ships took 
evasive maneuvers and launched antimissile chaff 
gen george b crist commander of us central command later 
said analysis of computer tapes showed no hostile missiles were 
fired and the blips were the tracks of us missiles and what the 
navy called hits on the system 
on thursday a central command spokesman maj barry willey 
said that study found no human error lack of training or 
technical malfunction and the ships officers were justified in 
assuming they were under attack 
us officials would not comment on a report that one of the 
jack williams stinger antiaircraft missile operators was 
later sent home suffering apparent psychological problems from his 
first combat exposure he just kind of choked said a friend 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the navys methods for dealing with stress begin with intensive 
training which officers say builds confidence and includes other 
means ranging from sports exercise and recreational diversions to 
personal counseling 
us officers readily concede that such efforts are not 
foolproof 
when a routine thats already full of tension suddenly becomes 
something a lot bigger with real danger maybe shooting you cant 
predict how people are going to react especially if theyve never 
done it before said one officer 
a key element in coping with stress is to assure sailors they 
are not alone in facing pressure said another officer 
we emphasize togetherness that everybodys part of a team 
the combat information team the gunnery team the flight team 
whatever the better your relationships the better you can 
function in a situation 
few ships promote a team concept as strenuously as the 
vincennes team 49 alluding to its hull number appears on 
bulletin boards souvenirs and baseball caps and is used by capt 
will c rogers iii in addressing his crew 
skippers say their biggest concern is keeping crews in the high 
state of constant readiness needed in the gulf where short 
distances require fast decisions 
the hardest part of the mission is that you have to stay ready 
24 hours a day theres no time really to let your guard down 
said cmdr paul x rinn three weeks later rinns ship the 
frigate samuel b roberts was nearly sunk when it hit an iranian 
mine 
shipboard tensions and boredom are relieved as much as possible 
by recreational activities aboard the amphibious assault ship 
dubuque the crew recently was treated to boxing matches and a rock 
concert by a touring uso band 
its great way to let off steam said a sailor after 
defeating one of his buddies in the days featured threeround 
heavyweight match 
some us ships have spent virtually all of their threemonth 
gulf tours escorting convoys or on patrol and crist said one 
reason for deploying a multipurpose warship like the vincennes was 
to allow others more time in port 
many officers say the entire navy was badly shaken by the 
shooting down of the iranian jetliner however they say it has not 
caused any noticeable morale crisis and the general view is that 
in the same situation most commanders would act just as rogers did 
every co has to call his best shot based on the information 
flow he gets at the time and live with that decision the rest 
of his life thats what command is all about said the dubuques 
skipper capt alex g balian who won the silver star for valor in 
vietnam 
the navy traditionally relies on chaplains and doctors to 
counsel those in need with psychological guidance available in 
extreme cases 
gulfbased navy officers said no special stress counseling or 
confidencebuilding programs have been set up in the aftermath of 
the vincennes affair we dont have a morale problem said one 
capt wd center commander of the missile cruiser reeves and a 
friend of vincennes skipper rogers recalled that when the airbus 
was shot down his ship was just two days out of home port in 
yokosuka japan bound for the gulf 
we talked about it then we put it behind us everybody 
understands that we have to get on with the job he said

ghosts are fine traditional 
things to have around ancient english castles but the navy says 
rumors of one stalking the depths of the aircraft carrier uss 
forrestal have spooked a few sailors 
flickering lights bumps in the night locked doors opening 
voices on disconnected telephones and a vanishing figure in a 
khaki uniform the figures even got a nickname george 
at least thats what some of the men say aboard the forrestal 
in its fourth month of a sixmonth deployment in the indian ocean 
and the north arabian sea 
they were interviewed by lt james e brooks who detailed the 
story of the ghost in a 12page news release issued last month 
the report about george hasnt ruffled any navy feathers 
mayport navy spokesman lt park balevre said thursday i thought 
it was cute i think most people did 
what lt brooks had in mind was a fluff piece to show the 
lighter side of the navy said balevre 
but according to brooks some sailors dont think the ghost 
story is at all cute 
george lurks in two of the ships belowthewaterline storage 
areas one of them a former morgue spooked sailors claim 
ive got one guy working for me now who refuses to go down 
there alone our last chief petty officer in charge who has since 
transferred refused to go down there at all says petty officer 
daniel balboa in charge of the officers mess 
ive never seen any ghosts but you can hear weird things down 
there said balboa 
i was taking inventory one night and heard a noise like deck 
grating being picked up and dropped he recalled id turn 
around and look but didnt see anything when i turned around to 
begin my work again the noise started again 
one night balboa said he was checking temperatures in 
foodstorage freezers and kept finding open doors he had shut 
behind him 
it is impossible for anyone to open the reefer refrigerator 
doors from the outside behind me to open them from the outside 
requires a key since the doors lock automatically 
i had the only key with me that incident puts me on the verge 
of believing he said 
some say the ghost is a chief killed during a 1967 flight deck 
fire that killed 137 sailors in the gulf of tonkin off the coast of 
north vietnam brooks wrote others guess hes a pilot whose body 
was once stored on the ship 
petty officer james hillard hasnt ventured into the haunted 
areas since he saw george last year while checking out odd 
footsteps 
he was wearing a khaki uniform like an officer or chief would 
wear he says he followed the apparition into a compartment but 
there was nobody in there and i swear that is where he went 
hillard said 
mess specialist 2nd class gary weiss saw a khakiclad ghost go 
down a ladder to pump room no 1 whoever went down into the pump 
room never came out and the ladder is the only access he said 
hillard said he once was helping move supplies when a telephone 
that was reportedly disconnected kept ringing 
the phone rang and i answered it this time there was a faint 
voice calling help help im on the sixth deck rumor had it 
that a crew member was killed down there im very scared to go 
down there alone if i do i get out of there as fast as i can 
hillard said 
others are dubious 
i think its the guys imagination said senior chief petty 
officer james williams im not superstitious but when i go down 
there by myself i find it uneasy when that happens your 
imagination is going to play tricks on you

a warehouse fire destroyed 35 cars owned 
by reggie jackson and the retired baseball slugger and classic 
auto collector says hes hurting 
jackson who lives in nearby oakland was visibly upset thursday 
when he went to the warehouse which was destroyed by fire 
wednesday night 
he refused to be interviewed at his berkeley auto dealership 
saying he was down and hurting about his loss 
thirtyfive cars owned by jackson were lost including 
corvettes porsches mustangs and other highvalue collector 
cars said fire department capt ron littley 
the fire apparently started in a furniture store and spread to 
the warehouse in the same cinderblock building officials said the 
blaze raged out of control in the 33000squarefoot warehouse in 
an industrial area for more than an hour 
everything that was in there was gone said fire lt david 
allen the cause of the blaze was not immediately known 
jackson began his car collection in 1971 when he bought a 1940 
chevrolet for 300 and a color television by last october the 
collection had grown to 97 vehicles the rest of his collection was 
stored elsewhere

stellar career that also included stints with the new york yankees 
california angels and baltimore orioles

michael dukakis is laying out his positions on environmental 
issues during a tour of the west just as a poll indicated that 
region represents an untapped resource for democrats george bush 
invoked the names of kennedy and truman to show dukakis has veered 
far outside the mainstream on foreign policy 
as bush tried to portray the democratic presidential nominee as 
occupying the liberal extreme his own republican partys right 
wing was telling the vice president to avoid establishment blue 
bloods when choosing a running mate 
the warning from the coalition for a winning ticket came as gov 
george deukmejian of california took himself out of consideration 
in another campaign matter bush chief of staff craig fuller 
confirmed thursday that treasury secretary james a baker iii would 
leave his post and become campaign chief before the aug 15 start 
of the republican convention in new orleans sources said the 
announcement could come today 
we dont have to make the false choice the fools choice 
between economic growth or environmental quality dukakis told 
students at the university of california at los angeles we can 
have both and in fact we must have both 
dukakis west coast foray followed a trip into mississippi a 
traditionally democratic state that helped send president reagan 
and richard nixon to the white house dukakis lost the state to 
jesse jackson in this years democratic primary 
dukakis spoke at the neshoba county fair near where the bodies 
of three slain civil rights workers were found 24 years ago 
thursday reagan campaigned at the fair in 1980 for his first term 
dukakis failed to mention the killings when addressing the 
almost entirely white crowd and referred only once to civil 
rights i talked about economic opportunity because thats the 
most important single thing that concerns people he explained 
bush speaking to a hispanic veterans group in corpus christi 
texas criticized dukakis for his support for a nuclear freeze and 
opposition to a new mx missile the midgetman missile and the 
reagan administrations proposed star wars nuclear defense system 
his positions amount to a rejection of americas role as a 
world leader and a repudiation of the truman doctrine and the 
vision of john kennedy bush said referring to bipartisan 
foreign policy that evolved after world war ii and focused on 
containing communism 
dukakis when asked whether he still supports a nuclear freeze 
said sure and a comprehensive test ban treaty 
later aboard his plane dukakis said he originally supported a 
freeze because we wanted to stop the administration from 
expanding the arsenal 
now its turned around and were talking about reduction im 
for reductions now he said i favor the development of certain 
arms systems i favor deep cuts in strategic weapons systems 
bush also stabbed at the democratic platform calling it the 
black hole of american politics 
issues get sucked into it and lost never to reappear again 
he said 
bush later detoured to chicago for the wake of a polishamerican 
leader it was his third such appearance this week in an ethnic 
setting as the certain republican nominee tries to keep dukakis 
the multilingual son of immigrants from winning that segment of 
the population 
deukmejian said he took himself out of consideration because 
democrats would gain control of the statehouse in california if he 
dropped out the bush campaign said it accepted his decision 
sen gordon humphrey rnh who heads the conservative 
coalition urging bush to choose someone from the right said 
thursday 
the problem of the bush campaign is that it is attracted to 
establishment bluebloods what the bush ticket needs is a 
transfusion of red corpuscles from the conservative wing of our 
party 
he said sen dan quayle of indiana rep jack kemp of new york 
and gov john sununu of new hampshire would be acceptable 
a recent analysis by the gallup organization seems to give the 
democratic ticket hope in formerly proreagan western states 
the analysis said western voters are optimistic about their own 
financial future but dissatisfied with the general course of the 
nation and they dont find in bush the antiestablishment leader 
they found in reagan 
for example traditionally antigovernment voters in the rocky 
mountains are now calling for more government action on social 
issues than is the average american voter wrote andrew kohut 
head of the gallup organization 
kohut said the regional analyses he released were developed from 
8500 detailed interviews taken between may and july the margin of 
error is just under 2 percentage points the analysis was done for 
the timesmirror co

the environmental protection agency is backing 
a congressional move to stiffen prison terms and fines for the kind 
of medical waste dumping that has left coastlines from 
massachusetts to maryland littered with syringes dirty bandages 
and other hospital refuse 
legislation drafted by rep william j hughes dnj would 
make medical waste dumping at sea a federal crime punishable by up 
to 250000 in fines and five years in prison 
a hauler dumping hospital debris less than three miles from 
shore today could face up to 15 years in prison and 250000 in 
fines under the clean water act but violators outside the 
threemile limit would face a maximum of 50000 in fines and one 
year in prison under the applicable marine sanctuary act 
hughes expressed concern that the current laws may not apply to 
liquid medical waste or cover streams and other nonnavigable 
waters 
its clear that our existing state and federal laws dealing 
with the handling and disposal of medical wastes are inadequate and 
are not being properly enforced hughes said its equally 
clear that time has come to treat this problem as a criminal 
offense not just a regulatory matter 
hughes chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime 
said he hoped the measure would act as a deterrent and he said he 
would consider adding one provision to allow federal agents to 
claim the vessels and trucks used by illegal dumpers and a second 
provision to extend coverage to land dumping 
bill muszynski deputy administrator of the environmental 
protection agency for the new yorknew jersey region told the 
subcommittee the agency supports the measure 
clearly it is the feeling of most people that up to a year 
in prison is insufficient muszynski said 
last year the problem of medical waste washing up on beaches 
was relegated to new jersey shores but in the past month syringes 
and other hospital debris have been reported extensively on new 
york beaches and sporadically in connecticut rhode island and 
massachusetts late wednesday maryland reported its first case of 
medical waste 
the sad fact is there seems to be no scarcity of persons 
willing to dump these wastes anywhere and everywhere in order to 
avoid the cost of proper disposal or to reap the profits of 
improper disposal procedures hughes said 
the congressman said it costs hospitals 50 to 60 a ton for 
disposal of noninfectious trash but up to 2000 a ton for red 
bag materials that must be handled by private incineration 
companies an estimated 25 percent of the 150 million pounds of 
waste produced annually by hospitals is considered infectious 
hughes said 
the hughes bill was introduced tuesday on wednesday the senate 
passed a measure by sen frank lautenberg dnj that would 
require a cradletograve manifest system in new york new 
jersey and connecticut to help officials track medical waste 
i can no more do my job in the area of environmental 
protection and enforcement without such a law than i could 
effectively attack organized crime without wiretaps and the latest 
surveillance technology new jersey attorney general cary edwards 
said it puts us back to the old gumshoe days 
lautenberg and other lawmakers have attacked epa officials for 
failing to take action themselves muszynski said the agency does 
not have the authority to create a pilot program especially for 
three states 
he added that the agency is considering a national manifest 
system for medical waste

the promotion of voting is not among the 
priorities of many of americas companies even though the nation is 
facing a voter participation crisis a private group says 
people for the american way said thursday that 60 percent of the 
fortune 500 companies surveyed conduct little or no organized 
nonpartisan voter registration education or getoutthevote 
activities 
and only 6 percent have voter participation activities that 
reach beyond their own employees the group said 
ninetyone of the fortune 500s top 100 corporations responded 
to the groups phone and mail surveys which were conducted in 
april and may 
melanne verveer vice president of the group said the nation is 
facing the grim possibility that for the first time in its 
history less than half of the eligible voters will be going to the 
polls in the presidential election 
this crisis in participation is the result of a 
threedecadelong slide in voter participation that threatens to 
turn our government by all the people into government by less than 
half the people ms verveer said 
she said new institutions must take the lead to stem declining 
voter participation and she noted that a few businesses have taken 
exciting initiatives 
sherrod brown ohio secretary of state said many major 
corporations in ohio have printed up voter registration forms and 
mailed them to customers as part of their monthly billing 
procedures 
we figure we will put literally millions of registration 
forms without government spending into prospective voters 
hands brown said 
bruce akers vice president of the clevelandbased ameritrust 
bank said his company began offering voter registration services 
in cuyahoga county to its customers and the general public in 1982 
as a result of our success and the fact that weve had such a 
good response were going to take this program to the 11 other 
counties in ohio where we have branches akers said 
nevertheless verveer said that the inescapable conclusion of 
our study is that for the majority of corporations voter 
registration is nowhere to be found on their list of priorities 
the washingtonbased people for the american way is a 
nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization that conducts 
public education programs on constitutional issues

president daniel ortega said the 
leftist sandinista government would crack down harder on the 
domestic political opposition if the united states renews 
assistance to the contra rebels 
also thursday the foreign minister sent us secretary of state 
george p shultz a note protesting a river boat ambush that the 
government and witnesses blamed on the rebels 
shultz is touring latin america this week and was in brazil 
today in uruguay on thursday he accused the soviets of building 
airstrips in nicaragua and called the sandinistas a cancer that 
the united states must cut out before it spreads 
aid to the contras ran out in february but congress is 
considering new money for the insurgents the united states has been 
financing since 1981 
the government and the rebels agreed to a ceasefire on march 
23 and the government unilaterally extended the truce to the end 
of august 
speaking at an electricity plant near momotombo about 45 miles 
northwest of managua ortega warned that the government would cut 
off the oxygen of the internal opposition and begin fighting the 
contras again if a us aid package is approved 
in washington the white house on thursday rejected a 27 
million senate democratic proposal for humanitarian aid to the 
rebels but said congress and the reagan administration could still 
work out a compromise 
yankee pressure is not going to make the sandinistas more 
flexible orega said yankee pressure is going to toughen the 
sandinistas 
the government jailed more than 30 opposition figures and 
cracked down on opposition media after police broke up a large 
antigovernment rally on july 10 it expelled us ambassador 
richard melton and seven other american diplomats and washington 
responded by expelling eight nicaraguan diplomats 
in a note dated wednesday foreign minister miguel descoto 
reminded shultz that tuesdays boat attack which killed two people 
and wounded at least 24 was carried out a few hours from your 
stop in the region 
your visit to central america once again has helped encourage 
the war and the state terrorism that your country practices against 
nicaragua in flagrant violation of the norms and principles of 
international law descoto wrote 
the note was read to the associated press by an official at the 
foreign ministry 
radio liberacion the rebels station blamed the attack on the 
sandinistas they called it a staged attack on themselves 
intended to dissuade the us congress from approving new aid for 
the rebels 
the defense ministry said the boat was hit by rifle and mortar 
fire about 150 mile southeast of managua on the escondido river a 
major military supply route of the government about 200 
nicaraguans and 10 americans were on the boat and an american an 
italian and a costa rican were among the injured 
the rev lucius walker of demarest nj who was grazed in the 
buttocks by a bullet in the attack said wednesday the us 
government was responsible for terrorism because of its financial 
support for the rebels

the palestinian uprising election year 
politics and protracted labor disputes are undermining israels 
economic recovery program by pushing up inflation and reducing 
growth 
industrial production is down 35 percent the first such drop 
in eight years and inflation is expected to exceed 20 percent up 
from 16 percent last year and a third higher than initially 
forecast 
we had to scale down our expectations after more optimistic 
projections in early 1988 said ruth lowental assistant director 
general of economic affairs in the finance ministry 
the gloomier prognosis is accompanied by a feeling of 
insecurity because nobody knows whats going to happen after the 
nov 1 national election said joseph canaan an israeli 
journalist who writes for two west german economic publications 
a key reason for the slump is the 8monthold arab uprising in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip already has eaten up more 
than half of this years growth initially projected at 37 percent 
the uprising has cost more than 700 million in lost tourism 
uncollected taxes and additional military expenses said amnon 
neubach an economic adviser to foreign minister shimon peres 
in addition fewer of the 15 million palestinians in the 
occupied lands buy israeli products and about 20 percent of the 
110000 palestinians working in israel no longer report to their 
jobs as a result of a palestinian boycott 
when you have 15 million consumers who used to buy israeli 
products and they stopped doing it it has a serious effect 
said an israeli industrialist speaking on condition of anonymity 
stability is also threatened by increasing wage demands backed 
by numerous strikes by israeli workers excluding palestinian work 
stoppages the israeli economy lost 13 million work days due to 
strikes in 1987 more than triple the 1986 figure 
the labor disputes indicate workers are no longer willing to 
make the kind of sacrifices they accepted during a 1985 austerity 
program 
workers then accepted wage cuts of up to 20 percent to help stem 
soaring inflation and reduce a 3 billion budget deficit 
the program worked inflation dropped to 161 percent in 1987 
and the budget deficit fell from 136 percent of the gross domestic 
product of 12 billion shekels in 1984 to a surplus of 17 percent 
of the 1986 gdp of 13 billion shekels 812 million 
but in the past two years real wages have been rising faster 
than productivity heating up inflation and finance minister moshe 
nissim is under growing pressure to make concessions as the 
election campaign is heating up 
our basic target is to maintain stability ms lowental 
said but nobody knows whats going to happen with the wages 
still unsigned is a tentative agreement for an 11 percent wage 
increase over two years for the 450000 civil servants onethird 
of the civilian labor force also unresolved are private sector 
negotzed 
national health system with months of strikes and slowdowns 
the government agreed to emergency payments to ease the backlog 
of 15000 israelis waiting for operations but there has been 
little progress in wage talks for doctors who earn an average 700 
a month and are seeking wage hikes of more than 20 percent 
if the doctors get large increases it could affect the whole 
wage structure if you give higher wages to one group of people 
you have to give more to all the others said canaan 
nissim also is under pressure to devalue the israeli shekel 
which has been fixed at a rate of about 16 shekels to the dollar 
since the days of hyperinflation 
manufacturers complain the strong shekel is making it difficult 
for israeli exports to compete and is partly to blame for the drop 
in industrial production 
nissim has refused to devalue for fear of raising import prices 
and fueling inflation 
especially hard hit is koor the industrial conglomerate of the 
powerful histadrut trade union federation which lost 250 million 
in 1987 a record in israeli industry 
the united states which gives israel 12 billion a year in 
economic aid urged israel to sell off stateowned companies lower 
taxes and cut government spending 
the government has taken some steps in that direction but chaim 
barkai economics professor at hebrew university said no unpopular 
steps would be taken during the threemonth election campaign 
the government must close down unprofitable factories and cut 
spending but there wont be any changes in economic policy before 
the elections barkai said

iran and iraq would simultaneously halt 
their bloodshed and begin peace talks under a compromise solution 
proposed by the un chief but sources say iraq is cool to the 
idea 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar received a report 
thursday from a un military team that visited both nations on 
arrangements for a unsupervised ceasefire the contents were 
not disclosed but the un chief said he would make a report to 
the security council today 
perez de cuellar has been trying to resolve a standoff between 
the two nations over the timing of a truce and the start of 
ceasefire talks in their 8yearold war 
i think both parties are interested in a peaceful solution 
the concept of direct talks is accepted by both sides and the 
matter is when they will take place that is something on which i 
am working he said thursday 
the issue of facetoface talks between the bitter enemies has 
complicated the talks on implementing a truce and a un peace 
plan iraq demands that direct talks be held before a ceasefire 
and iran says they can begin only after a truce 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
perez de cuellar has proposed to both sides that he announce a 
ceasefire date and simultaneously invite both sides to hold direct 
talks on a comprehensive peace treaty 
the sources say the talks and a truce could begin the same day 
perhaps in a week if both sides are agreeable 
iraq also is asking that the five permanent members of the 
security council guarantee the truce and other elements of a peace 
plan the five united states soviet union china britain and 
france are considering the issue the sources said 
perez de cuellar did not spell out his proposals for reporters 
and said he has not yet received a formal response from iraq 
diplomatic sources say baghdad is not enthusiastic about the 
idea but stopped short of outright rejection of the proposed 
simultaneous announcement 
perez de cuellar said irans response although not formal has 
been constructive 
unfortunately from the iraqi side i have not received the 
comments which i have asked for perez de cuellar told reporters 
as he left un headquarters 
meanwhile the official iraqi news agency said in a dispatch 
from the united nations that iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz who 
heads iraqs negotiating team met thursday with the us envoy to 
the un ambassador vernon walters and visiting indian foreign 
minister pv narasimha rao 
the agency said the men discussed the ceasefire resolution and 
other issues but gave no other details 
perez de cuellar said that next week probably wednesday he 
would deliver a comprehensive report to the council on the 
ceasefire declaration troop withdrawal prisoner exchange and 
other elements of a un peace plan 
iran and iraq have waged war since 1980 when iraq invaded 
iranian territory the death toll is estimated at 1 million 
the security council in july 1987 adopted a resolution calling 
for a ceasefire in the war which has prompted an escalated us 
naval presence in the gulf 
iraq accepted the proposal but it was not until last month that 
iran after a series of battlefield defeats said it too would 
accept the resolution since then iraq has launched several 
attacks on iran to bolster its bargaining position 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati met the un chief 
for more than one hour thursday the iranian envoy made no comments 
as he left the meeting 
iraq says it needs the direct talks as a guarantee of sincerity 
from iran which it fears will seek only a temporary truce to 
regroup forces

secretary of state george shultz brought 
his latin american tour to brazil after accusing the soviet union 
of building airstrips in nicaragua that threaten the united states 
shultz arrived in the brazilian capital thursday night after a 
halfday visit to uruguay where he portrayed the leftist 
government in nicaragua as a cancer in central america 
nicaragua is a threat to the united states not for what it 
might do but because of the power of the soviets who are building 
airstrips there which could pose a problem he told a news 
conference in montevideo the uruguayan capital 
there exists a cancer which we have to cut out and we are 
going to do everything possible to stop its growth the secretary 
added 
shultz did not elaborate on the airstrips the reagan 
administration repeatedly has ripped the prosoviet government in 
nicaragua and accused the soviets of building airstrips there 
hundreds of students and workers from leftist and union 
organizations marched in downtown montevideo near the foreign 
ministry to protest shultzs visit no incidents were reported 
nicaragua is again expected to be on the agenda during talks in 
brazil where shultz planned to meet today with foreign minister 
roberto de abreu sodre and president jose sarney 
much of his visit is to focus on trade policy a touchy topic 
here last month the washington announced its intention to impose 
sanctions on 200 million worth of brazilian exports because this 
country refuses to recognize patents on us drugs 
the brazil stop is the fourth on shultz ninenation latin 
american tour 
shultz began in guatemala on monday where he failed to obtain a 
clear condemnation of nicaragua and its sandinista government 
instead shultz and four central american foreign ministers 
signed a declaration that called for peace democracy security 
social justice and economic development in the region 
in uruguay shultz issued yet another harsh denunciation of the 
sandinistas who are fighting the ussupported contra rebels 
trying to overthrow the government 
uruguay backs efforts of the contadora group comprised of 
mexico colombia venezuela and panama for a peaceful solution to 
the conflict in nicaragua 
shultz presented the us position in talks with president julio 
maria sanguinetti and foreign minister luis barrios tassano the 
uruguayan leaders issued no statement after the private meetings 
we talked about many things and we are not necessarily in 
agreement in every case but i can say and the president 
sanguinetti will be in agreement with me our relations are 
excellent shultz said later 
socialist deputy jose diaz said shultz arrived with the 
intention of pressuring uruguay to adopt the us position of 
diplomatically isolating nicaragua 
we will reaffirm to shultz the necessity to respect nations 
right to selfdetermination and we will keep searching for a latin 
american solution to a problem that is latin american diaz said 
the communist daily la hora put shultzs picture on page one and 
stamped on top of it undesirable 
shultz planned to spend the weekend in rio de janeiro 750 miles 
southeast of brasilia playing golf and holding private meetings 
on monday he leaves for bolivia 
the purpose of shultzs 10day tour was to renew acquaintances 
with friends and allies of the united states and call attention to 
latin americas returning democracies sanguinettis march 1985 
inauguration ended nearly 12 years of military rule 
as he did in argentina shultz met with key opposition leaders

with youths fully absorbed into the summer job 
market economists are looking to the nations unemployment rate to 
stabilize after a couple of months of large fluctuations 
on the eve of todays release of labor market figures for july 
most economists expected the rate either to remain at its 
14yearlow 53 percent in june or to rise a tenth of a percentage 
point with an employment increase of 150000 to 200000 
the jobless rate had bounced like a roller coaster from 56 
percent in march down to 54 percent in april and back up to 56 
percent in may before the june decline 
both private analysts and economists for the bureau of labor 
statistics said the monthly fluctuations were due primarily to two 
factors 
one factor is the adjustments the government makes with the may 
and june figures to account for the outofschool youths flooding 
the job market 
the other factor is the calendar the survey of 55800 
households upon which the rate is calculated is always taken on the 
12th day of the month because the 12th occurred in the second week 
of may but the third week in june economists said the real rate of 
joblessness was probably lower than what was reported in may and 
higher than the june figure 
i think there will be an uptick to 54 percent for july 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co but i 
wouldnt consider that as indicative of any new trend or a 
weakening of the economy 
payroll growth soared in june with 345000 new jobs compared 
with average monthly increases of 250000 from january through may 
after slowing down in the spring factory and construction 
employment also resumed their upward paths in june 
the labor department reported thursday that new claims for 
unemployment insurance seasonally adjusted jumped by 51000 in 
the third week of july to 371000 the highest since last january 
if the unemployment claims are rising that rapidly then new 
job creation may be a little skinny in july said michael evans 
a private washington economist who also expected the rate of 
joblessness to rise to 54 percent 
however other analysts attributed the increase in applications 
for unemployment benefits to temporary layoffs in the auto industry 
as manufacturers retooled their assembly lines for the 1989 models 
meanwhile fears that continuous months of unemployment rates in 
the range of 53 percent to 57 percent might trigger wage 
inflation so far appear unfounded 
although employers in tight job market areas along the east 
coast and in california are finding they have to pay much more than 
the minimum wage to attract workers for entrylevel jobs pay 
increases in general are still below inflation 
hourly wages actually fell 2 cents an hour in june to a 
seasonally adjusted 927 according to the labor department 
real wage rates have not yet recovered from a decade of price 
shocks and slow economic growth said wendy rayack a wesleyan 
university economist they are still nearly 7 percent below their 
1978 level

congressional democrats are trying again to 
fashion a pentagon bill that president reagan would sign in the 
wake of his rejection of their first attempt to write a defense 
budget 
the democraticcontrolled senate was scheduled today to return 
to work on a bill appropriating money for the pentagon in the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 
reagan vetoed an earlier pentagon budget bill because he 
objected to its reductions in his request for star wars 
antimissile spending and democraticadded arms control policy 
restrictions he opposes 
when he vetoed the bill wednesday reagan indicated he might be 
able to accept the appropriations measure which contains the same 
cuts in spending for the strategic defense initiative as star wars 
is formally known but none of the arms control limitations 
however those restrictions could be added as the senate tries 
to finish work on the bill befores its adjourns next week for a 
summer recess that wont end until after labor day 
the senate also may add to the bill a proposal to send new 
humanitarian aid to nicaraguas contra rebels but to restrict 
sharply the possibility of future military help reagan is seeking 
a package that includes immediate military aid 
reagan vetoed the bill which authorized the pentagon budget 
that measure is the first half of the twostep congressional budget 
process which also includes an appropriations bill that has money 
to pay for programs in the earlier authorization measure 
although the vetoed measure authorized 2995 billion worth of 
pentagon spending and the appropriations bill proposes 282 
billion the legislation is essentially the same dollar totals in 
authorization bills generally are higher because they cover more 
projects in future years 
when the senate finishes work on the appropriations bill it 
will go to a housesenate conference committee to be reconciled 
with separate legislation enacted by the house six weeks ago 
senate democratic leaders are considering adding the vetoed bill 
as an amendment to the appropriation measure which could force 
another showdown with reagan 
democrats have decided not to attempt to override the veto 
because they couldnt muster the twothirds vote needed in each 
chamber 
reagan had sought 48 billion for star wars next year compared 
with the programs current budget of 39 billion the vetoed bill 
would have cut his request to 4 billion and added other 
restrictions on what type of antimissile systems could be 
developed 
the appropriations bill contains 37 billion for star wars and 
a separate appropriation measure for the energy department included 
another 300 million for related research that would bring the 
total for next year to the 4 billion level rejected by reagan 
the bill also contains a 43 percent pay raise for the nations 
21 million uniformed military personnel 
conservatives have praised reagans veto saying it could 
energize the presidential candidacy of vice president george bush 
reagan met thursday with some of his conservative backers 
including former sen john tower a texas republican who once 
chaired the senate armed services comittee 
i think the president having vetoed the bill and having drawn 
the issue clearly is going to make it more politically perilous for 
the democratic majority in congress to repeat the bad legislation 
that appeared in this bill tower said after the meeting 
richard perle former assistant secretary of defense and now a 
fellow at the american enterprise institute said the key issue 
was the future of sdi this is not a dispute over details or 
precise funding levels the action taken by congress was 
intended to kill the program without taking political 
responsibility 
kenneth adelman former head of the arms control and disarmament 
agency called the veto the start of the issuefocused bush 
campaign and the staving off of creeping lame duckism for the 
reagan administration

republican george bush ending a week of sharp 
foreign policy attacks on michael dukakis was heading for his 
oceanside retreat in maine to film campaign commercials and 
continue pondering his choice for a running mate with his list 
one name shorter 
california gov george deukmejian asked thursday to be withdrawn 
from consideration and the vice presidents chief of staff craig 
fuller indicated the governors wishes would be honored 
hes going to be very important to us in winning california 
fuller said asked if that was the final word fuller said yes 
bush campaign aides previously had said deukmejian was among 
about a dozen people bush had told were under active consideration 
as you know if i were to assume the vice presidency it would 
mean turning the entire executive branch of the nations most 
populous state over to the democratic party deukmejian said in 
his letter to bush 
californias lieutenant governor and the next four officials in 
line for succession are democrats 
the vice president has said he will make up his mind on a 
running mate before he leaves for the republican national 
convention where he will be installed formally as the gop 
presidential nominee 
however he has vowed to keep his choice secret until late in 
the fourday august 1518 convention 
the vice president was traveling later today to his family 
vacation home in kennebunkport maine where he was to spend the 
weekend 
all five of bushs adult children and many of his grandchildren 
were to be with him for the making of campaign films that will 
focus on bushs family life aides said 
however bush delayed his departure until later today possibly 
for the longexpected announcement that treasury secretary james a 
baker iii will resign his post to take over as bushs campaign 
chairman 
bush aides thursday confimed that such an announcement was 
imminent there has been wide speculation that baker would make the 
announcement today at the close of financial markets 
president reagan is expected to name new york investment banker 
nicholas brady a close friend of bushs to fill out the rest of 
bakers term 
bush told reporters on air force 2 that he also will be working 
on his convention acceptance speech in the days ahead 
were going to go over the left field fence with the speech 
bush said 
bush who has been focusing on defense and foreign policy issues 
all week told a hispanic veterans group in corpus christi texas 
on thursday that foreign policy stands taken by dukakis the 
democratic presidential nominee would amount to unilateral 
disarmament 
all my experience tells me that the governor of massachusetts 
views if implemented would make the world not a safer place but 
more dangerous he told the gi forum 
he said dukakis had veered far outside the mainstream 
bipartisan consensus formed after world war ii to confront 
communist threats to free people worldwide 
his positions amount to a rejection of americas role as a 
world leader and a repudiation of the truman doctrine and the 
vision of john kennedy bush said 
he cited dukakis support for a nuclear freeze and opposition to 
advanced weapons systems favored by the reagan administration 
bush said the democratic platform is no help in trying to 
determine where the democratic presidential nominee stood on 
foreignpolicy issues 
the democratic platform is the black hole of american 
politics bush said issues get sucked into it and lost never 
to reappear again 
after leaving corpus christi bush made an unscheduled visit to 
chicago to attend a wake for aloysius mazewski who had been 
president of the national polish alliance 
majewski whom bush described as a friend of long standing and 
a great polishamerican leader died wednesday of a heart 
attack

mathias rust facing possible criminal 
charges in west germany for flying an airplane to moscows red 
square is getting less than a heros welcome in his homeland after 
he was freed from a soviet prison 
the 20yearold rust was in seclusion on thursday the day after 
the kremlin cut short his fouryear prison term he received for 
buzzing the kremlin spires on may 28 1987 
he said in a brief television interview from hanover that he was 
glad to be home after more than 14 months in prisonbut he also 
faces two investigations one of them by licensing officials in 
hamburg 
we are now investigating whether he is trustworthy enough to 
be flying thats the question spokesman wolfgang heidenreich 
told the associated press by telephone from hamburg he still has 
the right to be heard so no final decision has been made 
a suspension of the license also is possible heidenreich said 
but declined to predict the outcome of the investigation 
in the northern town of itzehoe prosecutor rolf schamerowski 
said he was looking into possible criminal charges of fraud and 
endangering air traffic 
the possiblility of a fraud charge stems from rusts misstating 
his destination when he checked out his flying clubs singleengine 
cessna and took off on a oneday jaunt to moscow 
well have to wait for the questioning of rust to see how the 
investigation proceeds schamerowski told reporters thursday 
only after the end of the investigation will it be clear whether 
there will be any sanctions against him in the federal republic 
west germany 
schamerowskis jurisdiction includes wedel the rust familys 
hometown six miles west of hamburg rust got his pilots license 
from hamburg state 
the aircraft is owned by the hamburg aeroclub where rust is 
still a member in addition to facing possible federal charges 
rust may have to pay aeroclub an unspecified amount for 
maintenance costs on the aircraft 
spokesman helmut gass also predicted rust will resign from the 
aeroclub because of members negative feelings about the 
famous pilot 
rust repeated the reasons for his flight in a brief interview 
with the norddeutsche rundfunk radio and television network of 
hamburg 
the motives were as ive always said to improve relations 
between our countries with this flight with my existence with the 
landing and to further the cause of peace in general rust 
said that was the goal 
but a poll by the bild newspaper indicates that most west 
germans do not approve of his daredevil act 
the newspaper said that in its poll of 1009 people only 4 
percent said they consider rust a hero 60 percent saw his 
flight as criminal mischief 7 percent as a serious crime 
and the remainder as a dumb act attributable to youth 
fiftytwo percent of those polled thought rust should 
permanently lose his pilots license bild said in a telex to other 
news organizations

president george vassiliou of cyprus said

dukakis have shown an increased interest in the cyprus issue and 
have clearly indicated that they would like a more active role 
played by the united states vassiliou said 
dukakis campaign reportedly has received strong financial 
support from the greekamerican community which has been calling 
for a withdrawal of the turkish forces which have occupied cyprus

both houses of congress are expected to act 
next week on a 39 billion drought aid compromise calling for a 
threemonth dairy pricesupport increase but limiting feed 
assistance for livestock producers 
the bill we have completed seeks to ensure the future for our 
farmers and ranchers senate agriculture committee chairman 
patrick j leahy dvt said thursday night after a conference 
committee agreed to the measure 
house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas said floor action would come thursday at the latest but 
that he would try for accelerated handling and final approval 
monday or tuesday 
fast action also was expected in the senate farm lawmakers in 
both houses were forecasting overwhelming approval for the 
electionyear measure 
president reagan was expected to sign the bill its 39 billion 
price tag represents a steep cut from levels at which 
administration budget officials said lawmakers would start to flirt 
with nasty fiscal repercussions 
at the core of the measure is a feature that would pay farmers 
with 65 percent of lost earnings beyond 35 percent of the expected 
harvest 
larger payments would be available for farmers very severely 
hurt by the fierce heat and shortage of rainfall plaguing the 
nations heartland 
the bill would furnish such producers with 90 percent of losses 
over 75 percent of their expected harvest it represented a 
compromise between the 95 percent level the house approved and the 
85 percent passed by the senate 
conferees fenced verbally without agreeing on much in sessions 
thursday morning and early afternoon leahy and de la garza finally 
went behind closed doors with top republican members of the 
conference committee 
they emerged thursday night with a compromise that was swiftly 
agreed to by other members of the conference committee 
the compromise jettisoned a senatepassed provision that would 
provide government feed assistance to farmers who would not 
ordinarily be producing their own feed even if not for the drought 
agriculture secretary richard lyng said wednesday he would be 
reluctant to recommend the feature to reagan because the price tag 
was 2 billion 
instead the conferees opted for a housepassed provision that 
would provide assistance to livestock producers who also produce 
their own feed the price tag would be 800 million by 
administration estimate 
livestock feed has become a key to the drought issue heat and a 
lack of rain have scorched a substantial quantity of hay and feed 
grains in the midcontinent causing feed prices to shoot up 
retained by the compromise was the one major dispute that the 
conferees had resolved earlier a house provision that would raise 
the dairy pricesupport level in april through june next year by 50 
cents to 1110 for each 100 pounds of milk 
leahy voted aye to the dairy plan while all of the other 
senate conferees remained silent the senate chairmans home state 
is a major source of the east coasts milk supply 
the senate recedes to the house by one weak aye de la garza 
chortled 
major modifications were made by conferees in a senateapproved 
provision that would constitute a major benefit for american 
manufacturers of ethanol ethyl alcohol made from farm products 
and mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol 
the senates plan would have allowed ethanol makers to buy 2 
million bushels each of surplus corn or other crops each month at 
110 percent of the govermentowned commodity credit corps 
acquisition price well below current droughtinflated prices 
the total available would have been limited to 16 million bushels a 
month 
it was described by proponents as a move to boost a number of 
small ethanol manufacturers but it also could have turned into a 
sizable subsidy for the archer daniels midland co of decatur 
ill a major corporation with a politically active management 
as reshaped by the conference committee the programs fate 
would be left up to the secretary of agriculture i dont think 
it will be put into effect said rep edward r madigan rill 
the ranking house agriculture committee republican 
ethanol producers that use more than 30 million bushels of corn 
a year would be excluded from the program 
the conference committee adopted house provisions that would 
make disaster payments available to farmers hit by disasters other 
than the drought including some that happened in 1987 the 
payments would be for drought hail excessive moisture or 
related condition 
de la garza said the related condition includes hurricanes 
because they come with moisture the hail payments were designed 
to compensate cotton growers in the district of rep larry combest 
rtexas where a severe storm hammered the crop last year 
administration officials had opposed going beyond payments to 
drought victims 
the two houses compromised on a house requirement that farmers 
would have to buy federal crop insurance in 1989 and 1990 to 
receive disaster payments under the legislation they would have 
to buy one year of the insurance if their disaster loss exceeded 65 
percent of normal yield

the soviets hope to develop an atomicpowered 
rocket engine to provide the propulsion for a manned mission to 
mars early in the 21th century a russian scientist said thursday 
vasiliy i moroz of the soviet space research institute said 
experts in his nation believe that a new type of rocket will 
have to be developed to make a planned 1year voyage to and from 
mars 
moroz said soviet engineers are working on an 
atomicelectric rocket engine that would be used to accelerate 
a mars explorer craft once it has been boosted into earth orbit 
the soviet scientist speaking at a news conference at the 20th 
general assembly of the international astronomical union declined 
to give any details on the atomicelectric rocket but he said none 
of the current chemical rockets used by the soviets is large enough 
for a mars mission 
included in the soviet fleet of launch rockets is the energia 
the worlds largest but moroz said even it is not powerful enough 
american space scientists long have recognized the need to 
develop propulsion systems that did not depend upon the chemical 
reaction of fuel and oxidizer the national aeronautics and space 
administration has conducted some research on electric and ion 
drive rockets but the project has never been received money for 
development 
moroz said the soviets are giving the exploration of mars a high 
priority two soviets probes to phobos a moon of mars were 
launched last month 
in 1994 he said the soviets will send an unmanned craft to 
mars carrying a robot rover that would explore hundreds of miles on 
the planets surface the rover also would take drill samples and 
measurements of the atmosphere 
the next stage of the program moroz said is testing in space 
new technical elements needed for a manned mission including the 
atomicelectric rocket and a rocket to return to orbit from the 
mars surface the soviets also plan a robot craft that would land 
on mars collect soil samples and then return them to earth 
a manned martian mission could be mounted by the year 2005 or 
2010 moroz said preliminary plans call for a sixmember crew to 
make the voyage in a twostage craft that would be assembled in 
earth orbit he said 
although the soviets have gathered a great amount of information 
about the deconditioning effects on the human body of longterm 
space flight moroz said the mars mission may use artificial 
gravity to keep the crew members healthy 
both american and soviet studies have shown that long exposure 
to the weightlessness of space causes the heart to weaken and the 
body to lose bone mass 
moroz said the soviets hope that american scientists and 
astronauts will take part in the mars mission but even without 
us participation the soviets are determined to explore the red 
planet 
mars has been only partially explored by the american viking 
spacecraft he said adding it is our impression that it is time 
to return to mars 
soviet scientists want to search for traces of liquid water on 
the martian surface and still hold out hope that there may be life 
even though viking found no traces moroz said 
you cant give guarantees that life in some form doesnt exist 
there now despite the negative findings of viking he said

rep mario biaggi was convicted of racketeering 
in a farreaching bribery and extortion scheme used to transform a 
tiny south bronx machine shop into the multimilliondollar defense 
contractor known as wedtech 
after biaggis conviction by a federal jury thursday the 
leadership of the house of representatives set sept 7 as the date 
for considering a recommendation from its ethics committee that it 
expel the 10term democrat 
the overwhelming likelihood is that the recommendation will be 
followed rep ted weiss dny said in washington 
us attorney rudolph giuliani called on congress to expel 
biaggi who was convicted last year on an unrelated corruption 
charge 
maybe its time they acted giuliani told a news conference 
this congressman has been convicted of numerous felonies 
earlier this year the ethics committee recommended biaggi be 
expelled for the earlier conviction but the committee held off 
sending the resolution to the house floor until after the wedtech 
trial so biaggi could defend himself in person 
after five days of deliberations the jury found biaggi and four 
codefendants guilty of turning nowdefunct wedtech corp into an 
enterprise that paid millions in bribes to public officials 
biaggi a city policeman from 1942 to 1965 and at one time the 
most decorated police officer in the country was also convicted of 
extortion and bribetaking 
were obviously disappointed and were going to appeal 
biaggi 70 said outside the courtroom earlier he had complained 
of chest pains and was treated in the courthouse nurses office 
it was the second legal blow of the week for biaggi whose 1987 
conviction was upheld monday by a federal appeals court 
us district judge constance baker motley scheduled sentencing 
for nov 18 all six of the convicted defendants remained free on 
bail 
biaggis eldest son richard 39 of fort lee nj was 
acquitted of racketeering charges but convicted of bribe taking 
mail fraud and tax charges 
also convicted of racketeering and other charges were former 
bronx borough president stanley simon 58 wedtech founder john 
mariotta 58 of scarsdale former small business administration 
regional head peter neglia 40 of armonk and biaggis former law 
partner bernard ehrlich 59 of bedford 
a seventh defendant former city police officer ronald betso 
40 of brooklyn was acquitted on all counts 
biaggi was convicted of all but one of the 16 counts against 
him including conspiracy extortion tax evasion and receiving 
bribes 
he faces up to 20 years in prison on the racketeering counts 
the most serious charges he has been sentenced to 30 months in 
prison for the 1987 conviction in brooklyn for obstructing justice 
and taking an illegal gratuity 
prosecutors also sought forfeiture of millions of dollars in 
illgotten gains by the five convicted of racketeering in 
addition biaggi mariotta and ehrlich face fines of more than 7 
million each 
biaggi was convicted of extorting 50000 in cash and stock once 
worth more than 3 million from wedtech in exchange for his 
political clout biaggi also was convicted of filing false 
financial disclosure statements and tax returns to cover up his 
illegal profits 
more than 130 witnesses were called in the trial which began 
march 11 four former wedtech executives who pleaded guilty to 
state and federal corruption charges and testified for the 
government in exchange for leniency 
at the heart of the wedtech case was how welbilt electronic die 
corp a tiny machine shop mariotta started in 1965 became a 
multimilliondollar defense contractor 
mariotta was once hailed as a hero for the 80s by president 
reagan for hiring exconvicts and former drug addicts in the south 
bronx one of americas most economically depressed areas 
prosecutors however charged that wedtech was built on greed 
and that mariotta and others at wedtech bribed biaggi simon and 
neglia for help with city and federal agencies 
prosecutors charged that ehrlich the younger biaggi and betso 
helped those three receive or cover up the payoffs 
however the defense contended that the corrupt wedtech 
executives who testified had the ear of white house insiders like 
attorney general edwin meese iii and did not need to bribe biaggi 
they noted that former white house aide lyn nofziger was 
convicted in washington of illegal lobbying for wedtech that meese 
was under investigation by a special prosecutor for his wedtech 
dealings and that a close meese friend lawyer e robert wallach 
was indicted for allegedly taking wedtech payoffs to influence 
meese and other officials 
near the end of the trial the special prosecutor announced 
there was insufficient evidence to charge meese with wrongdoing 
but questioned the attorney generals ethics on several issues 
prosecutors in the wedtech trial claimed the socalled meese 
defense was a smoke screen to divert attention away from the 
seven defendants

scientists and construction workers 
swarmed over this scenic sunbaked plateau thursday making final 
preparations for an historic ussoviet nuclear weapons 
verification experiment later this month 
us ambassador c paul robinson said the aug 17th test and 
another planned in the soviet union next month were a 
breakthrough in negotiations between the us and soviet union on 
nuclear testing 
it is unprecedented to be able to exchange this type of data 
said robinson the chief us negotiator at talks with the soviet 
union on nuclear testing 
reporters were taken thursday to the test site 130 miles 
northwest of las vegas for a daylong briefing and an impromptu 
news conference held on a platform fourtenths of a mile above the 
nuclear device 
the blast will have an explosive punch of up to 150 kilotons 
nearly 12 times the force of the atomic bomb that destroyed the 
japanese city of hiroshima 43 years ago saturday 
joe behne test director from lawrence livermore laboratories 
told the gathering that no one would be allowed within 15 miles of 
the site when the device is detonated 
the experiment is designed to test the ability of the united 
states and the soviet union to monitor the size of each others 
nuclear tests such monitoring is critical to comply with treaties 
limiting the size of nuclear tests under a policy of trust but 
verify 
treaties limiting tests to no more than 150 kilotons were passed 
in 1974 and 1976 but never ratified 
some three dozen soviet scientists will be on the nevada test 
site for this months blast codenamed kearsarge american 
scientists will monitor the september soviet test at semipalatinsk 
the device that will be detonated later this month was delivered 
july 20 and placed 180 feet above the bottom of a 2200foot 
vertical shaft 
the soviet scientists who have been on the nevada site since 
spring were not allowed to see the device itself according to 
behne 
but the soviets were allowed to examine the 8foot canister 
holding the device once the container painted red white and blue 
was sealed 
the joint verification experiment will focus on cables half an 
inch in diameter running to the site of detonation from instrument 
trailers hundreds of yards away and down to the device itself 
additional cables are placed in a second hole 30 feet away from and 
parallel to the weapon shaft 
the tests come two years after president reagan proposed using a 
system called corrtex which is designed to measure the size of a 
nuclear blast by the shock waves emitted from the nuclear device 
the soviets will be using a similar system of their own called 
miz and a second system which takes similar measurements 
the joint tests are to determine whether the two monitoring 
systems are compatible and whether explosions can be monitored by 
having the cables only in the second hole 
the sticking point for both countries has been the idea of 
allowing one country to place monitoring cables in the same hole as 
the device itself 
the breakthrough on the test verification issue came late last 
year in talks at geneva when both sides agreed to exchange 
scientists and monitor a test at each site officials say that if 
the monitoring systems work each country could have scientists at 
the others nuclear test site for all future tests

the treasury department said thursday it is 
working with debttroubled argentina to arrange a shortterm loan 
of up to 500 million from the united states and other creditor 
nations 
the socalled bridge loan would allow argentina to meet 
interest payments on its 56 billion foreign debt while it 
negotiates with the international monetary fund and the world bank 
but according to a department statement funds from the 
shortterm loan will not become available until argentina meets 
the requirements under the world banks lending program 
argentina which is more than 90 days past due on more than 300 
million in payments has said it cannot afford to make its overdue 
interest payments 
recently the nation has taken measures to cut its budget 
deficit and check its inflation running about 20 percent a month 
this week it declared a threeday bank holiday and devalued its 
currency 
the united states willingness to participate in this effort 
reflects support for argentinas economic reform efforts and the 
determination of the government of argentina to address its 
international financial relations in a constructive manner the 
treasury statement said 
it said the united states is working with other creditor 
governments through the bank for international settlements a 
clearinghouse in switzerland for central banks to formulate the 
bridge loan 
these efforts will be fully supported as well by the world 
bank and we expect that they will be supported as well by the 
international financial community it said 
in its own statement the imf said it was ready to start 
negotiations with argentina for a 12 billion loan 
the united states last month offered a similar bridge loan to 
brazil which is seeking to restore its standing in the 
international financial community after declaring a moratorium on 
its debt payments last year

the house on thursday gave lopsided bipartisan 
approval to a 71 billion electionyear package of minor tax 
changes that would benefit farmers mutualfund owners freelance 
writers and rural mail carriers 
the targeted tax cuts would be financed by higher taxes on 
defense contractors certain other corporations pipe smokers and 
purchasers of singlepremium life insurance policies

democrats and 19 republicans voted no 
the bill now goes to the senate where the finance committee has 
approved a strippeddown version

errors and clear up ambiguities in the landmark tax overhaul enaced 
in 1986 since this is almost certainly the only tax bill with a 
chance of becoming law this year the ways and means committee used 
it to carry dozens of substantive tax changes 
despite its size the bill is one of the smallest pieces of tax 
legislation in recent years the joint committee on taxation 
estimates it would cut taxes by about 71 billion through 1991 and 
raise taxes by about 47 million less than that amount 
nevertheless rep dan rostenkowski dill committee chairman 
told the house this bill is in keeping with the spirit of tax 
reform 
he and rep bill archer of texas senior republican on the 
committee emphasized that unlike most tax bills of recent years 
the legislation includes no tax breaks that are targeted for the 
benefit of only one or two individuals or corporations

checkmates is a crudely constructed 
cartoonish comedy by ron milner about the generation gap but this 
time the gap isnt between father and son or mother and daughter 
its a chasm between two married couples 
these middleclass couples also happen to be black but dont 
expect any revelations about race relations and what being black in 
a white society can do to a marriage checkmates which opened 
thursday at the 46th street theater is played mainly for laughs 
cheap laughs easy laughs laughs that do little to illuminate 
character or advance the plot 
plot is something that checkmates rarely encounters the 
play is mostly a series of sitcom sketches populated by one couple 
or the other as they fight make love or just try to get through 
the day naturally these people are a study in contrast 
frank and mattie cooper have been married for 45 years they 
have four children six grandchildren and a comfortable home in 
detroit where they are getting through franks retirement by 
talking about the couple upstairs 
their tenants are sylvester and laura williams young upwardly 
mobile and and preoccupied with self rather than we hes a 
salesman she works as a buyer for a department store career 
conflicts shes on the way up he could be on the way down 
threaten their marriage 
the audience watches as one marriage reaffirms itself and the 
other falls apart but its hard to care for these characters 
whether they are up or down 
milner wrote the book for dont get god started a gospel 
show that ran on broadway for several months last season it was a 
musical morality tale with dramatized lessons about life and love 
interspersed with some rousing gospel songs 
those same messages about sharing caring and giving show up in 
checkmates but this time there are no soaring melodies to lift 
the spirits between the sagging and soggy vingettes 
to pad out the evening the playwright flashes back to tell the 
older couples story you can tell when that happens because the 
lighting some lurid effects by designer ronald wallace changes 
color in these moments the audience learns of franks decision to 
leave his family and fight during world war ii as well as his 
affair with a french woman 
at least the production has been superbly cast with ruby dee 
and paul winfield starring as the older duo and denzel washington 
and marsha jackson appearing as the younger couple 
miss dee is a radiant actress and winfield a forceful stage 
presence so they mine the comedy for every giggle they can its 
depressing to watch them work so hard with such meager results 
washington has an ingratiating stage manner he survives because 
of his winning personality and not because of anything the author 
gives him to say or do miss jackson as the young wife has a 
harder job she must always be on the offensive hammering away at 
her husband or whining about her job and the complaints grow 
tiresome 
the wide stage at the 46th street theater has been sliced in 
half by two separate apartments both realistically designed by 
edward burbridge the action alternates between the two homes with 
the predictability of a boring tennis match 
director woodie king jr doesnt do anything to lessen the 
pingpong effect but its hard to see what king could have done to 
liven up the evening because of milners simpleminded and obvious 
script checkmates is checkmated even before the curtain goes 
up

chevrolet for 300 and a color television by last october the 
collection had grown to 97 vehicles the rest of his collection was 
stored elsewhere 
the fire visible from the bay bridge raged out of control in 
the 33000squarefoot warehouse in an industrial area for more 
than an hour 
everything that was in there was gone said fire lt david 
allen the cause of the blaze was not immediately known 
jackson retired last fall from the oakland athletics after a 
career that included stints with the california angels baltimore

in fatally shooting an intruder who broke into his gun store two 
weeks ago a grand jury decided thursday 
donn dibiasio 59 of smithfield used reasonable force in 
defending himself even though he shot the intruder more than once

murder then arraigned and released on 1000 personal recognizance

business productivity deteriorated at a rate not seen in seven 
years while labor costs soared during the second quarter the 
government has said in a report that sparked sparking concern over 
the future of the economys competitive vigor 
in another report on thursday the nations largest retailers 
said sales for july were lackluster as unusually hot weather kept 
many consumers out of stores 
the labor departments bureau of labor statistics said the 
efficiency of nonfarm businesses in producing goods and services 
declined 17 percent in the quarter ended june 30 its first 
decline in two years and the biggest drop since 1981 
productivity had risen at an annual rate of 34 percent in the 
second quarter and had been improving at a rate of 1 percent to 2 
percent annually in the previous three years 
reflecting the strong economic expansion output of goods and 
services by those businesses responsible for threefourths of us 
economic activity rose 47 percent in the second quarter 
but to achieve that growth companies increased their work hours 
by 65 percent hiring hundreds of thousands of new employees to 
send the unemployment rate to a 14year low of 53 percent 
meanwhile labor costs soared 59 percent in the first quarter 
as hourly wages and benefits rose at an annual rate of 41 percent 
after taking into account a 44 percent annual rate of inflation 
in the last 18 months workers purchasing power actually declined 
06 percent from april through june the department said 
among retailers the nations biggest store chains were at the 
mercy of weather extremes as a relentless heat wave kept shoppers 
home last month preventing stores from clearing out their summer 
merchandise 
the july results ended a modest recovery the stores enjoyed in 
june which had followed a slump in april and may caused by cold 
and rain 
overall consumers have cut back on their retail outlays over 
the past year and a half because of high installment debt levels

hot weather sent the nations largest general retailers back 
into a slump during july but the stores and wall street analysts 
are looking toward august with some optimism 
last months relentless heat largely kept shoppers out of 
stores hampered retailers attempts to clear out summer 
merchandise and made sales reports issued by the stores thursday 
disappointing 
the higher temperatures ended a modest rally the retailers 
enjoyed in june 
in addition to weather the stores reports reflected the 
overall softness that has plagued the retail industry for about a 
year and a half said jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch 
amp co 
consumers have cut back on their retail spending because of high 
installment debt levels and uncertainty about the economy as a 
result retailers sales have been a soft spot in an otherwise 
strong economy 
consumer spending which also includes expenditures for food 
medical care autos utilities transportation and other 
necessities is watched closely because it accounts for twothirds 
of the gross national product 
walter loeb an analyst with the investment firm morgan stanley 
amp co said july generally is not an important month for retailers 
but this month will be critical especially for apparel 
retailers who have been in a yearlong slump as women turned away 
from the retailers offerings of shorter skirts and clothes 
shoppers widely perceived as boring 
the retailers have revamped their fall lines and analysts 
predict there will be a pickup in clothing sales that may begin 
showing up in the stores august results 
i would expect sales would accelerate loeb said i am 
looking for a good august 
in their reports thursday several retailers recorded sales 
increases under 3 percent meaning the stores were losing ground 
to inflation which has run at an annual rate of 44 percent so far 
this year 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck amp co said its 
overall sales rose 72 percent last month and 54 percent for the 
first half of the fiscal year compared with the same periods of 
1987 sears sales for stores open at least a year socalled 
samestore sales were up 25 percent last month and 21 percent 
for the year so far 
retailers and industry analysts believe samestore sales are a 
more accurate yardstick of a companys performance than figures 
which include sales from new stores 
k mart corp said its overall sales rose 48 percent last month 
and 53 percent during the first half while samestore sales edged 
up 07 percent in july and 18 percent for the year to date

business week says it has not uncovered any 
evidence implicating its editorial employees in a spreading scandal 
involving prepublication leaks of the magazines stock tips and 
again has defended its actions in dealing internally with its 
suspicions without telling authorities 
the magazine in its aug 15 issue released to the press late 
thursday gave its first detailed account of the scandal two weeks 
after first confirming it was investigating the leaks 
so far seven people around the nation have been forced from 
their jobs in connection with the magazine scandal and federal law 
enforcement officials have begun a criminal investigation 
evidence uncovered so far suggests some printers at two of the 
four plants that print business week peddled unpublished copies to 
brokers who bought stocks recommended by the inside wall 
street column and sold them later at a profit after publication 
attracted more buyers and boosted the price of the stocks 
in the aug 15 issue business week estimated that price changes 
in 20 stocks mentioned in the column this year generated potential 
profits of 24 million few appear to have made a killing the 
magazine said 
business week which is published by mcgrawhill inc said its 
editors detected questionable price changes in stocks mentioned in 
the column as far back as early last year 
but the magazines editors met with mcgrawhill lawyers who 
recommended against reporting the matter to the securities and 
exchange commission business week said the story said business 
week had nothing but suspicions about stock price movements and had 
no concrete evidence implicating anyone 
while business week was under no legal obligation to notify the 
sec the story said magazine editors also were concerned that an 
investigation might raise first amendment problems namely that 
investigators might demand the names of confidential sources of 
gene marcial who regularly writes the column 
instead the magazine attempted to police its own shop by 
sharply reducing the number of business week copies distributed in 
the mcgrawhill building before the official release date from 600 
to 20 
the magazine also sent letters to its printers citing the 
widespread concern about insider trading and reminding them of 
the confidentiality policy 
business week said the suspicious trading seemed to subside for 
awhile but then reappeared this past spring 
the price moves attracted the attention of the stock watch 
department of the new york stock exchange which began its own 
inquiry but did not notify business week or the sec the story said 
the dow jones professional investor report made the first public 
disclosure of the suspicious stock movements in a story july 21 
business week finally confirmed its own probe and the scandal began 
snowballing

hertz corp forced to pay a record 685 
million fine for overbilling insurance companies and thousands of 
consumers for the costs of repairing damaged rental cars says it 
has cleaned up its business practices 
a federal judge on thursday slapped the auto rental giant with 
the fine and required it to pay restitution that brings hertz 
total bill to more than 20 million after the company pleaded 
guilty to bilking customers and insurance companies with 
fraudulently inflated collision repair charges 
hertz cheated customers out of more than 13 million between 
jan 1 1978 and the summer of 1985 when it learned that a federal 
grand jury was investigating the company andrew j maloney the 
us attorney in brooklyn told a news conference 
those who paid money to hertz because of autobody damage during 
the period may be eligible for a refund ranging from a few dollars 
to several thousand dollars according to assistant us attorney 
jonny j frank who led the investigation 
maloney said the 685 million fine was believed to be the 
largest ever imposed in a consumer fraud case 
us district judge eugene nickerson assessed the penalty during 
a proceeding in which the company pleaded guilty to mail fraud and 
agreed to make restitution 
nickerson said that within the next 15 days hertz must deposit 
137 million into a special fund to be disbursed to individuals 
and insurance companies that were overcharged hertz will have to 
to pay even more if the fund is insufficient the judge said 
todays action by the united states attorneys office is 
deeply disturbing to me and everyone at hertz frank olson 
chairman of the company said in a statement we regret that 
improper practices took place and are fully committed to making 
full refunds of all overcharges 
john martin a lawyer for hertz said lowlevel managers in the 
company had been responsible for the overbilling and top executives 
had been unaware of the practices everyone responsible for the 
problem has been fired he said 
the investigation began when a woman fired on another matter 
from a hertz office in massachusetts reported the billing practices 
to the insurance crime prevention institute an organization funded 
by the insurance industry 
maloney and the other officials declined to identify the woman 
in a related state case new york attorney general robert abrams 
said hertz had agreed to make an additional 2 million in 
restitution to some 10000 customers who paid for repairs between 
june 1 1985 and may 31 1986 
the company consented to the order in an agreement with new york 
and 40 other states 
in that case the company admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to 
make the refunds abrams said that during the period hertz charged 
prevailing retail prices for repairs when the actual repair 
cost was about 22 percent less 
frank said that after hertz learned in 1985 that it was the 
subject of a federal grand jury probe it altered the fine print in 
its rental contract to show it was charging more for repairs than 
it was paying 
this ended the companys criminal activity but left it open to 
the state attorneys general civil action frank said 
in the federal case hertz admitted using phony damage claims 
altered documents and inflated repair bills to charge higher prices 
than it paid to repair automobiles damaged in accidents 
hertz employed a number of techniques to defraud its customers 
prosecutors said 
without informing its car renters hertz sent to customers who 
were involved in an accident or to their insurance companies damage 
appraisals that did not reflect discounts the company received 
because it operated large fleets of vehicles 
the company also programmed a computer to produce inflated 
damagerepair estimates 
hertz also prepared appraisals only on the basis of photographs 
or accident reports to set the billed cost of repairing a damaged 
car maloney said hertz disguised these phony appraisals as 
legitimate by forging appraisers signatures 
maloney said it was not criminal for an automobile rental 
company to earn a profit on repairs but said hertz acted illegally 
by failing to inform its customers and by submitting fraudulent 
documents 
hertz said it now bills only for its actual cost of repairs and 
has discontinued the other illegal practices 
maloney said the case should serve as a warning to other 
companies 
we do not believe that the practices are limited to the hertz 
corp some of these practices were industrywide he said

one of the worlds biggest accounting firms is 
spearheading a 5 million program to help smaller colleges and 
universities improve their teaching of business ethics prompted by 
a survey indicating that ethics programs were a little spotty 
chicagobased arthur andersen amp co has developed pace a 
fiveyear program of seminars aimed at helping faculty at business 
schools nationwide to make ethics instruction part of their basic 
course work 
duane r kullberg the firms managing partner and chief 
executive officer said arthur andersen views the program partly as 
an investment in its own future 
as one of the nations largest employers of business school 
graduates we have a significant interest in their development 
kullberg said this program benefits arthur andersen as well as 
the business community in general 
wall streets insidertrading scandals and shady 
defensecontract deals have focused public attention on moral 
issues in business 
but while many graduate business schools have responded by 
introducing ethics courses often as electives for mba candidates 
few small colleges and public universities can match the 
resources of the leading private business schools in developing 
such programs 
harvard business school for example received a 30 million 
gift last year from former securities and exchange commission 
chairman john sr shad to finance a program in ethics education 
but kullberg said an andersenfinanced survey found the 
development of ethicseducation in the business curriculums of 
smaller colleges and public universities to be a little spotty 
there is a desire to find a solution a desire to find a 
practical way to deal with the subject he said in a telephone 
interview this week 
so andersen developed the pace program and invited 
businessschool instructors from around the nation to review it 
some 300 of them came to the chicago area this spring and summer at 
andersens expense to attend twoday seminars on incorporating 
ethics lessons into their routine course work 
andersen has asked the approximately 60 institutions that sent 
representatives to this years seminars to try the pace approach 
for at least one semester 
the team of ethics teachers business school instructors and 
business professionals who developed pace decided ethics should be 
taught as part of the five basic business disciplines finance 
marketing economics management and accounting 
i see that as a big plus said conrad doenges a professor 
of finance at the university of texas at austin who attended a pace 
seminar 
in real life doenges said ethical issues can arise at any 
point at almost any time 
by incorporating ethics discussions into finance courses he 
said the student sees ethical issues as a part of finance as a 
part of his normal business life rather than as a segmented or 
compartmented area of study 
to foster discussions pace offers fictitious case studies 
tailored to each discipline the case studies are meant to reflect 
ethical dilemmas that business students might face early in their 
careers such as sexual harassment truth in advertising plant 
closings wage discrimination and ledger manipulation 
the dilemmas have no easy or correct solutions but are designed 
to get students talking and thinking 
students need to grapple with these issues so they can have 
some experience in thinking about these issues said alison 
ashton an assistant professor of accounting at duke universitys 
fuqua school of business 
robert allan cooke director of the institute for business 
ethics at depaul university in chicago and a member of the pace 
development group said the pace program was designed to give 
business students the basic skill to deal with ethical dilemmas 
just as they learned the basic skills of management and accounting 
we believe very strongly that most ethical problems that arise 
come from lack of information and that lack of information results 
in poor judgment he said were trying to provide the 
information that will help alleviate those bad judgments

the securities and exchange commission on 
thursday charged towers financial corp which has made takeover 
overtures for pan american world airways inc with selling 20 
million in unregistered securities 
the sec filed a civil suit alleging that towers failed to 
satisfy disclosure requirements when it publicly sold 20 million 
in notes between october 1986 and october 1987 
towers is a factoring firm which buys accounts receivable at a 
discount and earns a profit by collecting the full face amount 
we say they financed a factoring program with an unlawful 
securities offering and we want them to stop said jason 
gettinger a staff attorney for the sec in new york 
the sec asked the us district court to bar towers from using 
the money it received in the securities sales and to issue an 
injunction barring the company from further violation of federal 
registration requirements the agency also said it wanted towers to 
return the noteholders money 
ira l sorkin who represents towers said the company and its 
top executives recognized that there may be a technical violation 
of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws and 
will make every effort to comply with those provisions 
towers beginning last year made a number of announcements 
indicating it might make a bid for pan am but has yet to mount a 
takeover and was regarded by wall street as a questionable suitor 
but its overtures attracted public attention because the firm 
said its offer included support from former navy secretary john 
lehman

ltv corp operating under chapter 11 protection 
from creditors said thursday its second quarter net income rose by 
284 percent over the same period last year 
ltv said its net income in the three months ended june 30 rose 
to 1576 million or 114 per share from 1227 million or 91 
cents per share a year earlier

million or 267 per share compared with net income of 2523 
million or 217 per share for the first six months of 1987 
revenue for the six months to 394 billion from 384 billion 
the domestic steel industrys performance has improved as a 
result of massive cost cutting cyclical factors and a more 
reasonably valued dollar said raymond h hay ltv chairman and 
chief executive 
however the industry continues to face the threats of 
unfairly priced imported steel and inadequate longterm return on 
invested capital as well as the risks of successfully weathering 
the next economic downturn 
hay emphasized a need to extend voluntary restraint agreements 
set to expire in 1898 to limit steel imports 
ltv in may submitted a reorganization plan to creditor groups 
for consideration 
at the end of the second quarter ltv had a negative net worth 
of 17 billion
