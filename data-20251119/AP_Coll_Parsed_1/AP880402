a blind attorney who was carried forcibly from 
a jetliner after a dispute over where she should be seated 
complains that airlines look at the handicapped as if were a 
safety risk and have to be treated like baggage 
the attorney peggy pinder said friday she is still angry over 
an incident thursday evening aboard a midway airlines jetliner 
waiting to take off from washingtons national airport on a flight 
to chicago 
after boarding she said she sat in a window seat in the second 
row from the back of the cabin in the smoking section but she was 
told to move to the first row in the front of the cabin because she 
is blind and needed to be closer to a fulldoor emergency exit 
when she refused arguing that there are no federal safety 
regulations that require her to sit in a particular seat police 
were summoned and carried her off the plane she was charged with 
trespassing 
it was embarrassing miss pinder 34 an attorney from 
grinnell iowa and a vice president of the national federation of 
the blind said in an interview they told the police to carry me 
off and they did 
she insisted that she sought no confrontation and wanted only to 
return to her hometown when the dispute erupted aboard midway 
flight 179 as it prepared to depart for chicago 
the flight was delayed about 45 minutes because of the 
confrontation according to airport officials 
ironically miss pinder had flown to washington to meet with 
several members of congress and officials of the republican party 
platform committee to discuss problems blind people are having in 
air travel 
she said she was told by a flight attendant that she could not 
sit at the rear of the aircraft even though her seat did not block 
access to any emergency exit doors because of the airlines policy 
on dealing with handicapped passengers 
then the captain came he said you will do what the flight 
attendant tells you and sit where youre told or not fly on this 
airplane she recounted 
she refused to budge and airport police were called to carry her 
off the plane according to accounts related by airline and airport 
officials as well as miss pinder 
they airline officials feel that blind people are not the 
same as other passengers that were a safety risk and that we have 
to be treated like baggage in order to carry us safely said miss 
pinder thats not federal law they violated my rights 
she has been summoned to appear at an arraignment on the 
trespass charge may 19 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the faa has no requirements on 
where blind passengers should be seated although the agency has 
recomended that they not be seated in a row that has an emergency 
exit miss pinder said she sat in a row with no such exit 
a midway airlines spokeswoman sandra allen said that the 
airline has a firm policy of seating handicapped passengers 
including those who are blind on the front row of the aircraft 
cabin because those seats are closest to a floorlevel emergency 
door 
responding to the incident involving miss pinder miss allen 
said she refused to be briefed on safety procedures and 
maintained she could sit where she wanted we could not take off 
seated where she was and asked her to step off the plane because 
she was inconveniencing 100 passengers 
because of her confrontation thursday night she remained in the 
capital another day and on friday accompanied several other 
officials of the national federation of the blind to a meeting with 
transportation secretary jim burnley to discuss alleged 
discrimination against the handicapped by the airlines a 
spokewoman for the federation said 
the federal aviation administration which is part of the 
department is developing new regulations aimed at giving the 
airlines closer guidance on how to provide for the handicapped but 
those regulations are not expected to be announced for several 
months

a new jersey congressman says something just 
doesnt smell right about a federal banking agencys request for 
an fbi check of one of its critics 
the request to the fbi from a federal home loan bank board 
official smacks of a way of life that seems to be more 
appropriate to life in latin america than it does in the united 
states rep james florio dnj said friday 
the fbi check was revealed by an internal bank board 
investigation requested by florio chairman of the house energy and 
commerce consumer protection subcommittee 
the report by bank board inspector general paul gibbons 
disclosed that the office of rosemary stewart bank board 
enforcement director asked the fbi on aug 17 to check on william 
juliano a mount laurel nj developer 
the fbi returned the request which listed only julianos name 
and address stamped insufficient information and ms stewart 
decided not to pursue the matter 
because of julianos criticism florio had asked for an 
investigation of the federal asset disposition association the arm 
of the bank board that manages and sells real estate from bankrupt 
savings and loans 
fada was under attack from juliano other business people and 
members of congress for reported mismanagement and conflicts of 
interest 
juliano had threatened to bring a class action lawsuit against 
fada on behalf of disgruntled developers who believed they had been 
poorly treated by the agency 
ms stewart told investigators she was asked in june to obtain 
the fbi check from fada general counsel robert j axley who said 
juliano had made verbal threats and written nasty letters to then 
fada president rosyln payne 
axley told the investigators that ms payne asked him to have 
juliano checked out after she received anonymous telephone calls 
in the middle of the night to her unlisted home telephone 
axley said he subsequently received a tip that juliano had ties 
to organized crime however the bank board report said the tip 
referred to someone with a different first name than julianos 
after her request to the fbi was returned ms stewart said she 
learned more about the nature of julianos dispute with fada 
consulted her superiors at the bank board and decided it was not 
appropriate for her to resubmit the query to the fbi 
but florio said for the bank board to even contemplate 
investigating a citizen for complaining raises a lot of questions 
something just doesnt smell right here 
ms stewart did not immediately return telephone messages left 
at her office friday afternoon there was no answer at julianos 
office 
karl hoyle a bank board spokesman said the agency acknowledges 
that the request to the fbi should never have been made 
once we were aware of it we indicated we didnt want that 
pursued and after that it was not he said rosemary to her 
credit said maybe were not supposed to be doing that sort of 
thing 
the bank board has also acknowledged that a law firm hired by 
fada engaged a private detective agency to look into julianos 
finances 
fbi spokesman william carter said the fbi would not consider it 
proper to investigate a government critic the bureaus practice 
he said is to ask for more information about the reason a 
background check is requested and if the explanation is not 
appropriate it can recommend administrative or disciplinary actions 
against the person who made the request 
hoyle said ms stewart has not been reprimanded

horseradish eaten during traditional passover 
dinners can pose a health hazard says a jewish doctor whose father 
collapsed after consuming an olivesized serving of the bitter herb 
dr haya r rubin said friday that her father cleveland state 
university sociologist israel rubin quickly recovered after he 
fainted keeled over and suffered a small seizure during a seder 
or traditional passover meal several years ago 
she said the incident shows that people prone to high blood 
pressure heart or artery disease or stroke might be better off if 
they let horseradish fumes evaporate by keeping it uncovered for a 
half hour before the seder or use a substitute such as chopped 
romaine lettuce stalks 
rubin suffered high blood pressure before the incident said his 
daughter an internist at the university of california los 
angeles and consultant to the rand corp 
the passover holiday which celebrates the israelites exodus 
from slavery in ancient egypt extends from friday night until 
sundown april 9 seders are held on the first two nights 
horseradish is eaten during the ceremonial meal as a bitter 
herb symbolizing the bitterness of slavery 
a letter warning that horseradish can be dangerous was published 
friday in the journal of the american medical association by ms 
rubin and dr albert w wu a clinical instructor at the university 
of california san diego 
wu said the horseradishinduced sudden loss of blood pressure 
that caused rubin to faint and collapse could trigger a fatal 
stroke heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm in people with heart 
disease 
wu and ms rubin trained together at mount sinai medical center 
in new york they decided to write the letter after wu spotted a 
letter about a similar incident published in the same journal in 
january 
in that letter dr daniel e spitzer of montefiore hospital in 
new york told how a healthy 63yearold man collapsed after eating 
a large mound of wasabi or greencolored japanese horseradish 
during a meal of sushi 
spitzers letter was headlined horseradish horrors sushi 
syncope syncope means fainting the followup letter by ms 
rubin and wu carried the headline the bitter herbs of seder more 
on horseradish horrors 
ms rubin said horseradish usually is grated but the night her 
father collapsed the family ground it in a food processor then 
placed it in an airtight container preventing vapors from escaping 
and making the horseradish unusually potent 
wu said the collapse probably occurred because the horseradish 
vapors caused a reflexive drop in blood pressure coupled with the 
elder rubins consumption of passover wine and use of medicine to 
reduce his high blood pressure that briefly deprived the brain of 
enough blood 
he still eats horseradish ms rubin said my dad is sort 
of macho

american corporations that owe taxes to panama 
will be allowed the us foreign tax credit if payments are made to 
the government of ousted president eric arturo delvalle the 
internal revenue service says 
fridays announcement was aimed at discouraging us businesses 
from sending tax payments to the panamanian government controlled 
by military strongman manuel antonio noriega which washington does 
not recognize 
some large usbased multinational firms recently made 
quarterly tax payments just in time to give that government a 
desperately needed infusion of cash 
the foreign tax credit is designed to prevent two national 
governments from taxing the same dollar of income in general the 
united states will not tax income that an american corporation 
earns in and pays taxes on to a foreign country 
 
washington ap the general accounting office recommends 
mandatory inspection of all nuclear power plants for pipe 
deterioration following findings that nearly onethird of the 
nations commercial reactors already have such a problem 
the congressional watchdog agency deemed the industrywide 
inspections necessary after reviewing actions taken by the nuclear 
regulatory commission and the utilities themselves since a pipe 
rupture at the surry unit 2 plant in virginia killed four workers 
in late 1986 
rep edward j markey dmass who released the gao report 
declared that the nrcs failure to act aggressively on this 
matter is astounding 
after the surry accident the nrc did develop evidence of 
widespread pipe deterioration at the trojan nuclear plant in 
oregon and as of jan 21 this year the commission had identified a 
total of 34 plants with at least some pipe damage caused by erosion 
or corrosion 
in defense of the nrcs approach robert newlin a commission 
spokesman said the commission had sent out several notices to 
the industry asking them to inspect their own plants and report 
back

testing of civilian employees in certain critical jobs 
the directive went out today paige eversole an army 
spokeswoman at the pentagon said friday it orders resumption of 
the program effective immediately 
the move had been expected since tuesday when a federal appeals

covering development of the new midgetman mobile nuclear missile 
canceling almost 1 billion worth of work planned by six 
contractors 
the service in a brief statement stressed it could not speak 
for the six contractors involved but estimated the cutbacks could 
affect the jobs of as many as 2300 privatesector employees 
the air force action became inevitable several months ago when 
defense secretary frank c carlucci decided the pentagon could not 
afford to develop and deploy the singlewarhead midgetman within 
the budget levels set by the white house and congress 
the air force had recommended carlucci kill the program 
outright but the defense secretary decided to request 200 million

the leader of the august coup attempt 
that almost toppled the government of president corazon aquino 
escaped saturday from his prison ship in manila bay the military 
announced 
a statement said former lt col gregorio gringo honasan 
fled at about 230 am saturday 130 pm est friday aboard two 
rubber boats along with 13 of his guards 
chief of staff gen renato de villa ordered a massive search for 
the 39yearold honasan and alerted subordinate commands nationwide 
to be on the lookout for him 
the charismatic former lieutenant colonel had been detained on 
the navy ship since his arrest last december in a manila suburb 
col oscar florendo chief military spokesman said a reserve 
lieutenant who was frustrated over his inability to obtain a 
regular commission had aided in the getaway 
florendo said the boats used in the escape had been sent to 
increase security after the military learned of a plot to free 
honasan 
de villa immediately relieved the commander of the vessel the 
rps andres bonifacio and ordered his arrest florendo said in a 
radio address he appealed to the public to provide information to 
help recapture honasan 
honasan former chief of security at the defense ministry 
played a key role in the feb 22 1986 mutiny which triggered the 
popular uprising that toppled president ferdinand marcos 
but honasan became disillusioned with marcos successor 
president corazon aquino accusing her of weak and inept 
leadership that fortified the 18yearold communist insurgency 
on aug 28 honasan led a force of 2000 men who attacked the 
presidential palace and seized several media and military 
installations in the capital before they were driven off by 
proaquino forces 
the coup attempt left 53 people dead and wounded hundreds and 
mrs aquino said it was aimed at killing her and her family 
honasans effort was the most serious of several major plots to 
unseat mrs aquinos government 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
former colonel was so popular that he had become the dominant 
figure aboard the ship which was supposed to be his prison 
it is with sadness that the afp armed forces of the 
philippines makes public the unfortunate escape from custody of 
excol gregorio honasan from his detention florendo said in a 
statement during a normal inspection of the ship it was 
discovered that subject detainee together with his guards headed by 
lt jg gerardo mojica and 12 enlisted personnel were found 
missing 
initial investigation revealed that honasan was apparently 
assisted and joined by his guards led by lt jg mojica it is 
believed that bribery was a factor that led to the betrayal of 
their oath and sworn duty 
florendo said de villa had alerted the military to take 
precautions to ensure that communist rebels did not take advantage 
of the confusion to launch terroristic actions 
the spokesman said troops were being deployed around manila to 
search for honasan 
florendo said the military received information a week ago that 
honasan would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard the 
ship 
he said the military expected outsiders to try to storm the 
vessel but instead it came from the inside 
honasan was security chief of the defense ministry when 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile was minister of national defense 
enrile was fired in november 1986 after the government said it 
thwarted a coup attempt by his followers 
honasan remained in hiding for months after the august coup 
brig gen ramon montano commander of the national capital 
regional defense command said weeks before the arrest that honasan 
was being protected by undisclosed civilian and military figures

two years after an iowa physicist nearly 
ruined his reputation by suggesting that 10 million small speedy 
comets hit earths atmosphere annually a nasa scientist has found 
evidence supporting louis franks theory 
im happy but its been a long two years frank said 
friday adding that he was met with total disbelief and lost 
a lot of friends after proposing that billions of waterbearing 
comets could have provided enough water to fill the seas during 
earths early history 
other scientists said they remained skeptical of the new 
evidence which came from telescope observations by clayne yeates 
a physicist at the national aeronautics and space administrations 
jet propulsion laboratory here 
im very convinced that what im seeing is real said 
yeates who is deputy project scientist for the planned 1989 launch 
of the galileo space probe to jupiter these objects would not 
have been seen inadvertently during other searches theyre small 
theyre dark and theyre moving fast 
the theory by frank a physicist at the university of iowa is 
one of the decades most controversial astronomical theories a 
nasa news release said 
frank proposed the theory after ultraviolet photographs of earth 
taken by nasas dynamics explorer 1 spacecraft between 1981 and 
1986 revealed countless dark spots that appeared to be tiny holes 
in earths atmosphere 
he theorized that about 10 million comets essentially 
30footdiameter fluffy snowballs with a dark coating plunge into 
the atmosphere each year forming holes then breaking up and 
vaporizing 
yeates said his observations on the 36inch spacewatch telescope 
at kitt peak national observatory in arizona make him believe that 
at least a million such comets hit the atmosphere annually at a 
speed of 22000 mph 
the comets appeared as white streaks on enhanced telescope 
images he said 
in a telephone interview from iowa city frank said a 
soontobepublished study in which atmospheric holes were 
recently observed by swedens viking spacecraft also supports his 
theory 
im a little skeptical said astronomer anita cochran of the 
university of texas at austin he yeates may be seeing 
something but to leap to 10meter comets is a fairly large leap of 
imagination 
cochran voiced the most common objection to franks theory if 
so many icy comets hit earths atmosphere they also should strike 
the moon creating a lot of water vapor yet the moon has very 
little water vapor 
university of michigan physicist and planetary scientist thomas 
donahue said that until he examines yeates findings im not 
going to say this sounds like confirmation of franks comets or 
not but it certainly is exciting 
about a year ago donahue used 1977 data from the voyager 2 
space probe to show that earths atmosphere contained an excess of 
hydrogen atoms released from water vapor he said the discovery 
could be consistent with franks theory but also could be 
explained if the hydrogen came from 10 million times fewer comets 
that were smaller faster and much more active than those 
postulated by frank 
the less abundant comets wouldnt provide enough water to fill 
the oceans donahue said 
i really am a bit skeptical of yeates observations said 
brian marsden associate director for planetary sciences at the 
harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics in cambridge mass 
if they comets are as numerous as hes talking about then 
some of these should show up when the telescope is in more normal 
operation and they havent marsden said 
frank said only two specialized telescopes in the country 
including spacewatch are capable of observing the comets

we would be putting into effect under jackson if you did 
everything he said he wanted to do wed be in bankruptcy koch 
said friday people know thats pie in the sky 
in response jacksons campaign manager jerry austin said koch 
has solidified his position in the national exaggeration hall of 
fame 
koch said jackson is on the wrong side of every issue i know 
of with two exceptions drugs hes great in opposition to drugs 
and hes great in talking about the need for family responsibility 
and particularly as it relates to education 
on the economy hes terrible wed be in bankruptcy 
nevertheless the mayor said hed vote for jackson if he were 
the nominee out of party loyalty and because hed be better than 
vice president george bush 
in green bay wis jackson told reporters he had not heard of 
kochs remarks but when they were described to him he said

iowa democrats say theyll expose and 
work to defeat supporters of political extremist lyndon larouche 
who filed as democrats to run in legislative and congressional 
primaries 
what they seek to do is clothe themselves with the 
respectability and tradition of the democratic party in order to 
further their misguided beliefs said house speaker don avenson 
i will use all the available resources to ensure the defeat of 
larouche candidates in every democratic primary contest 
they apparently feel this is fertile ground but we are going 
to teach them a major lesson said joe shanahan who runs 
legislative elections for the party

supporters who had filed nominating petitions to run in the

soldiers were off the streets as 
easter weekend began and a jailed opposition leaders wife said her 
husband was being held hostage in gen manuel antonio noriegas 
effort to maintain power 
also friday the pentagon said it was sending 1300 more 
military personnel to protect us bases and thousands of american 
residents bringing to nearly 12000 the number of us troops in 
panama 
opposition leaders said they planned to meet today or sunday to 
decide whether to lift a 12dayold general strike that has shut 
down most commercial activity in an effort to oust noriega 
panamas de facto leader and heads of its 15000member defense 
forces 
virtually all businesses were closed for good friday the 
general strike had eased earlier in the week with groceries and 
pharmacies reopening reportedly under government pressure 
in the united states news reports said reagan administration 
officials had discussed trying to force noriega from power through 
military intervention kidnapping or by arranging a coup 
the general is under us indictment on drug trafficking charges 
carlos gonzalez de la lastra a top leader of the opposition 
national civic crusade spent his fifth day in jail friday other 
crusade leaders and several journalists arrested with him monday 
had all been released by midday tuesday 
all legal efforts on his behalf have been useless vilma 
gonzalez de la lastra told the associated press friday night 
they have not charged him but they dont let him go 
we consider carlos a political hostage she said of her 
husband 
the pentagon said many of the us personnel to be dispatched 
next week are military police but army helicopter units will be 
included 
the us southern command based in panama had about 600 
security personnel among its 10000 troopers before washington 
intensified its campaign for noriegas removal 
over a 10day period that ended march 24 the pentagon 
dispatched 670 more security personnel to panama for the stated 
purpose of protecting military facilities 
southern command spokesman col ronald sconyers said the latest 
troop increase was prompted by a longstanding look at what has 
been going on down here he said it was not made in anticipation 
of an imminent departure of noriega and any instability that might 
follow 
no evacuation plans have been discussed with the 45000 
americans living in panama he added 
limitations on movement for us military personnel were 
decreased friday to the lowest of four levels for the first time 
since the crisis began feb 26 permitting them to move freely but 
avoid crowds and demonstrations 
panamanian police patrols replaced soldiers friday for the first 
time since a failed march 16 coup attempt against noriega it was 
an indication of how the city has quieted for the holiday weekend 
after weeks of protest 
banks have been closed since march 3 and panamanians who had 
cash appeared to be using it only for essentials 
despite rumors the decision to lift the strike had been made 
two crusade leaders roberto aleman and luis casco arias said that 
was not the case 
to the contrary no decision on that will be made until we are 
able to meet to discuss it said casco arias 
the national council of private enterprise an umbrella group of 
business organizations has decided to continue the stoppage 
aleman said 
noriega supporters in the national legislature ousted civilian 
president eric arturo delvalle on feb 26 after delvalle tried to 
fire the general 
the united states subsequently froze panamanian government 
deposits in us banks in an effort to drive out noriega the 
shortage of money and a run on panamas banks forced them to shut 
down

the rightwing nationalist 
republican party has vowed to seek a nullification of the 
legislative assembly elections in which it fell short of a clear 
majority by gaining 30 of the 60 seats 
party leaders accused the central elections council of 
manipulating the official results of the march 20 balloting which 
were announced friday 
the council said the party known by its spanish acronym arena 
won 30 seats president jose napoleon duartes centrist christian 
democrat 23 and the conservative national conciliation party seven 
arena emerged as the strongest single party replacing the 
christian democrats but its failure to win a majority could 
produce a legislative deadlock during duartes final year in office 
national conciliation lawmakers were reported considering an 
alignment with the christian democrats that would give them the 
balance of power on major issues and counter arenas strength 
in the outgoing legislative assembly elected in march 1984 the 
christian democrats had 33 seats and arena 13 
mario samayoa president of the elections council and a director 
of the christian democratic party said the final results presented 
an interesting situation because no party will predominate 
he also said that while the computer count of votes for mayors 
in the nations 262 municipalities was not complete it appeared 
arena candidates had won in 178 races 
the elections council report was denounced by angry arena 
leaders who earlier had claimed their party won 35 assembly seats 
and a firm majority 
on tuesday arena removed its representative from the panel of 
observers from the three major parties overseeing the vote count 
francisco merino the arena representative said the christian 
democrat and national conciliation delegates were trying to make a 
game of the vote tallies in order to change the results of the 
elections 
roberto daubuisson the former army major who founded arena 
said the alliance would petition the council to nullify the 
official results and if that was rejected the issue would be taken 
to the supreme court 
three days after the election daubuisson had said we dont 
want to promote violence but we want to play clean and they wont 
let us 
samayoa said friday that arena would have to accept the results 
and reevaluate its positions 
the national association for private enterprise declared it 
would call a general strike if the elections council did not report 
an arena majority 
duarte a staunch us ally was elected in 1984 and is barred 
by the constitution from seeking another five year term next year 
in the 1984 campaign he pledged to improve the economy and end 
the 8yearold war with leftist rebels 
arena had based its campaign this year on the continuing 
conflict unemployment estimated at 40 percent and inflation 
running at an annual rate of 40 percent

the us navy says it has succeeded in 
using underwater robots to locate mines in the persian gulf for the 
first time since minesweeping operatons began last year 
a spokesman for the floridabased us central command said the 
navy used the devices to locate two mines in the socalled farsi 
channel of the northern gulf where the us minesweeping 
operations have been concentrated 
he spoke on condition he not be identified 
on monday the mine sweeper fearless used its new super sea 
rover as the submersible is known to locate a mine tethered to 
a seabed anchor in 90 feet of water he said 
on wednesday the fearless submersible robot found another 
mine this time by following an anchor and cable to where the 
explosive lay on the bottom the spokesman said friday 
both mines covered with a layer of marine growth indicating 
they had been in the water a long time were detonated by navy 
divers 
the navy also said friday that it has found and destroyed 41 
mines in the gulf since its sweeping operations began 
the updated figure doubles the number of mines previously 
reported to have been destroyed by the americans 
in late november after the navys korean warvintage ocean mine 
sweepers went into action and quickly found 15 mines in the 
northern gulf commanders reported the mine threat was under 
control 
on friday when asked about the current situation the navy said 
through its spokesman that our mine countermeasure force is 
wellsuited for the requirements at hand 
us officers have refused to say whether they have found 
evidence of any recent minelaying activity by iran which is 
believed to have planted the explosives 
the mines found by the us navy as well as about 20 found in 
other areas of the gulf by the french and the british navies were 
all of the 1908model contacttype which explode when a ship bumps 
against their detonator spikes 
one such mine damaged the 401283ton supertanker bridgeton 
during the first northbound convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers 
july 21 
the bridgeton incident prompted the united states and five 
european governments to send mine sweepers to the gulf 
the soviets and saudi arabia also maintain minesweeping vessels 
in the waterway where the tanker war an offshoot of the 
7yearold iraqiran war has raged for four years 
the us spokesman said the 41 mines destroyed by the navy are 
in addition to 14 others that were recovered intact for research 
purposes

overseas brats a magazine for 
americans who went to high school half a world away from their 
homeland is helping them find classmates they havent seen for 
years says its army brat publisher 
the difference between stateside graduates and army brats air 
force brats navy juniors and others is that those in stateside 
have a hometown to go to for a reunion said publisher and editor 
joe condrill 
but the brats after they graduate they leave the military 
environment and sometimes are lost he said 
military dependents often are seen as pampered kids living off 
their globetraveling parents condrill said recently but they 
endure hardships abroad and often have trouble adjusting to 
american life he said 
class reunions help by bringing overseas graduates together he 
said 
these people need someone who understands their predicament 
said condrill 32 
at least 1 million people have gone to overseas us schools 
since the institutions were created in 1946 condrill said more 
than 80000 students attend overseas schools each year and more 
than 5000 graduate 
were not going to find everybody through the magazine but at 
least this is one way of finding some of them said condrill 
whose father was an army colonel 
condrill a 1973 graduate of the tehran american high school in 
iran said many military dependents are unable to have 10year high 
school reunions like graduates of stateside schools because their 
classes usually are so small some cannot return to their alma 
maters because it would be too expensive 
because of the difficulty in organizing reunions many students 
who attended a particular overseas school get together even if 
they graduated in different years 
these reunions create incredible bonds condrill said 
when you put these people together im not surprised to see 
strangers talking like old friends 
condrill who founded his quarterly magazine in 1986 boasts 
1000 subscribers in the united states and 12 countries 
during the day he works for a floor products company but spends 
evenings and weekends answering correspondence or writing stories 
for overseas brats his byline appears on most stories but there 
are a few subscribers who offer articles reminiscing about growing 
up overseas 
the 12page tabloid also carries announcements about upcoming 
reunions and personal advertisements that resemble lostandfound 
ads 
peggy roth a 1976 graduate of george dewey high school in subic 
bay the philippines organized a reunion in 1986 before the 
magazine was founded she says the magazine has made finding 
friends much easier today 
overseas brats has been a big help said the arlington 
texas woman its interesting reading other peoples 
experiences and it has made me realize that we are a unique group 
sort of a loose fraternity it has helped us unite 
condrill also has helped organize reunions in 1982 only six 
overseas schools held reunions but 30 threeday reunions are 
planned this summer throughout the country condrill said 
this takes them back to a happier time to a more innocent 
time in their lives he said at these things they are not 
talking about kids about taxes they feel much younger than they 
are and theyre talking with people who were in the same 
predicament as they were

michael dukakis is borrowing a few pages from the populist 
playbooks of rival jesse jackson and exrival richard gephardt as 
the presidential candidates try to drum up delegates in next weeks 
wisconsin primary 
with dukakis and jackson neckandneck in the delegate count 
thus far dukakis with 65355 to jacksons 64355 another 81 
delegates are at stake in tuesdays primary in wisconsin 
both candidates also planned weekend forays into colorado which 
holds caucuses monday that begin the selection process for 45 of 
the states 51 democratic delegates and its 36 gop delegates to the 
national conventions 
the massachusetts governor on friday stepped up his quest for 
bluecollar votes in wisconsin by sounding the themes of economic 
populism that had been articulated by gephardt until the missouri 
congressman exited the race last month 
the human cost of seven years of republican indifference is 
staggering dukakis said in a television ad that started airing 
friday who in this administration could look right into the eyes 
of the laidoff factory worker or the homeless family and say 
theyve kept the promise of america i say theyve broken that 
promise 
the new emphasis was evident in his speeches as well 
wall street pirates and corporate hit teams arent the model 
for a new america dukakis told a crowd of about 500 people 
crowded into the racine labor center 
gephardt interviewed on the syndicated show one on one 
said he didnt mind seeing his ideas circulate among those left in 
the race hed once hoped to finish first 
everybody has stolen it he said i willed it to everybody 
when i pulled out and i hope they will use it it is the issue of 
this campaign 
jackson who sounds the populist message as well on friday 
called for higher prices for farm products and said consumers 
easily could pick up the tab 
the fact is farmers deserve fair prices and workers deserve 
fair wages and the rich must pay fair taxes jackson told a 
gathering at the farm of bud and faye lee in amery wis the 
reality is if urban people are working they can pay a few more 
pennies for a glass of milk or for a cone of ice cream or for a 
loaf of bread 
jackson speaking later friday in la crosse invited disgruntled 
republicans to vote for him in tuesdays primary 
for people who made the colossal error of voting for 
president reagan and now realize your mistake you can correct 
your error he said wisconsin law allows voters to select a 
candidate from any party regardless of their political affiliation 
tennessee sen albert gore jr lagging behind in the democratic 
race continued to be the main voice of criticism against jackson 
whose popularity has surged in recent contests 
an end to bigotry does not mean some candidates are game for 
criticism and some are immune gore said 
bringing up the rear was paul simon who aimed his fire at gore 
simon visiting about 100 supporters at an airport rally in eau 
claire accused gore of making bold promises to farmers and added 
if youre looking for a candidate with all kinds of easy 
promises im not your candidate i voted against the 1985 farm 
program that caused a drop in milk prices we have to do better and 
i wont make promises unlike some people 
gore favors government price supports for dairy farms and is 
proposing a twotier support formula that he said would help family 
farms compete against corporate farms 
on the republican side 47 delegates were at stake in wisconsin 
with vice president george bush the commanding leader over token 
competitor pat robertson 
robertson was spending the weekend in colorado which holds 
caucuses monday trying to drum up some support westernstyle his 
schedule included talks to an estimated 5000 people in denverarea 
congregations on easter sunday 
robertson has conceded he has virtually no chance of being the 
gop nominee but wants to help influence the gop platform at the 
convention 
he wants to represent conservatives and christians in the 
formation of the platform so that we can have a voice said aide

gandhis orders the united news of india reported 
the prime minister also called the federally appointed punjab 
governor ss ray to new delhi today for urgent consultations on 
the violence 
in addition police and paramilitary troops began stepping up 
security on pakistan border with the state where police say 
smugglers have been moving large quantities of new weapons to the 
sikh extremists uni said 
the latest killings raised to 111 the number of people who have 
died in punjab since sunday in attacks blamed on militant sikhs who 
have since 1982 been waging a guerrilla war for a separate homeland 
so far this year more than 635 people have died in punjab 
state including hindus and moderate sikhs sikh militants say they 
are discriminated against by indias hindu majority 
rightwing hindu groups called for a general strike in amritsar

secretary of state george p shultz has 
recommended kidnapping panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
and a ciacoordinated military coup as ways of unseating the 
general a newspaper reported today 
shultz and elliott abrams assistant secretary of state for 
latin america also suggested landing more than 3000 us soldiers 
in panama to encourage panamanian military officers opposed to 
noriega said the los angeles times 
the proposals were strongly opposed by the cia and defense 
secretary frank c carlucci who labeled them dangerous and 
illtimed said the times quoting unidentified administration 
officials on both sides of the discussion 
however actions still being considered by the cabinet include 
fomenting a coup against noriega and landing more than 3000 
soldiers at us installations in panama in a show of force the 
times said a group of panamanian officers attempted a coup last 
month but failed 
state department spokesman charles redman traveling with shultz 
in rome would not comment on the report 
shultz and abrams suggested sending a special operations team to 
kidnap noriega and bring him to the united states for trial on drug 
trafficking charges the newspaper said 
a kidnapping was ruled out after opponents argued that the 
united states image would be blackened if noriega were 
accidentally killed during such an attempt the times said they 
also warned shultz of the repercussions of arresting a foreign 
leader in his own country to face criminal charges in the united 
states 
shultz and abrams also proposed taking unspecified military 
action inside panama in response to a request from deposed civilian 
president eric a delvalle the newspaper said delvalle was ousted 
by noriega last month after he attempted to fire the general 
the pentagon announced friday that it was sending about 1300 
additional military personnel to panama to improve security for 
us bases and for us civilians living there 
the move fell far short of the steps advocated by shultz who 
urged the use of force against noriega after aides concluded us 
economic pressure on the troubled central american country was 
faltering the times said 
the united states already has about 10000 troops in panama to 
protect the strategic panama canal an additional 17000 us 
citizens live in panama 
pressure against noriegas regime has been mounting since he was 
named in a federal indictment alleging he helped drug traffickers 
move cocaine into the united states 
us officials have also alleged that noriega was dealing with 
cuban president fidel castro while was ostensibly cooperating with 
us drug and intelligence agencies 
the reagan administration precipitated an economic crisis in 
panama last month by cutting off the supply of us dollars to 
panamanian banks but the maneuver appeared to weaken this week 
after noriega broke a general strike seized flour mills and 
reopened panamas ports

jim jordan whose likeable but bumbling 
fibber mcgee character delighted millions who tuned into radios 
classic comedy fibber mcgee and molly for 22 years is dead at 
age 91 
jordan died friday at beverly medical center about a week after 
suffering a blood clot in the brain following a fall at his home 
said family friend and broadcast personality fran allison 
his show was one of the greatest continuing radio shows that 
ever existed said miss allison who starred in early 
televisions kukla fran and ollie show 
fibber mcgee and molly was on the nbc radio network from 
1935 to 1957 it spawned such maxims as taint funny mcgee 
heavenly days youre a hard man mcgee and dadrat the 
dadratted 
familiar routines included mcgees overstuffed closet which 
always unloaded mercilessly on jordans character whenever it was 
opened 
even the mcgees address 79 wistful vista became a place on 
americas cultural roadmap 
each tuesday night jordan welcomed to his home such 
unforgettable characters as wallace wimple the old timer beulah 
the maid and myrt mcgees omnipresent telephone operator 
even though he had become very frail his mind and his humor 
were as fresh as ever we all adored him said lenore kingston a 
vice president of pacific pioneer broadcasters jordan had served 
as chairman of the radio veterans group 
like the couple in the fibber mcgee and molly scripts the 
shows stars were married jim and marian jordan came to radio out 
of vaudeville to formulate with writer don quinn the quintessential 
situation comedy 
we dont like i mean people dont like humor that 
suggests anything repulsive jordan said in an interview during 
the shows height anatomy gags jibes about marriage and 
mothersinlaw were kept out 
it is typically american humor neither the broadway type nor 
hollywood influenced hubbard keavy of the associated press wrote 
in 1940 they get their humor from simple things like fixing the 
brakes or playing checkers they never just tell jokes they never 
step out of character 
the situations in the show turned on such simple items as fibber 
deciding against mollys advice to tune the piano his bumbling 
effort was invariably interrupted by the bongbong of the door 
chimes 
the mcgees neighbors were a classic set of american humor 
characters 
hal peary played the rumbling pompous throckmorton 
gildersleeve cliff arquette was the cantankerous oldtimer bill 
thompson was henpecked wallace wimple and gale gordon later a 
regular on the lucy show was mayor la trivia 
after the show ended in 1957 a television version was attempted 
in nbcs 19591960 season of the original cast only peary 
remained and he played mayor la trivia not gildersleeve 
jordan a native of peoria ill met marian driscoll at choir 
practice when both were in their teens they married in 1918 
the couple began appearing on radio in 1925 but still worked 
vaudeville because the new medium paid so little in 10 years of 
trialanderror work they created fibber mcgee and molly 
mrs jordan died of cancer in 1961 jordan married gretchen 
stewart the following year she survives him 
other survivors include a son jim jr and daughter kathryn 
from his marriage to marian as well as several grandchildren

breezy weather early today forced 
organizers to scratch their attempt at a worldrecord humanpowered 
flight across the aegean sea by a cyclistpilot in a flying machine 
called the daedalus 
windless weather is important for the 74mile flight to the 
island of santorini and winds of nearly six miles an hour grounded 
the silverandpink aircraft on a military runway at the last 
moment 
its disappointing but the wind seems to be a little too 
strong pilot greg zack 26 a professional cyclist from 
wilmington nc told reporters 
the lastminute postponement illustrated just how unpredictable 
the weather can be on this southern greek island 
gusting winds and rain squalls delayed the first scheduled 
flight of the daedalus 88 on wednesday 
after nine days of blustery weather conditions thursday were 
good enough to allow the five athlete pilots to take turns 
testflying the plane at speeds of around 14 miles per hour and 
about 15 feet above the tarmac of the greek air force base 
a successful touchdown on santorini thira would more than 
triple the exisiting record of 225 miles for straightline 
humanpowered flight set by bryan allen piloting the gossamer 
albatross across the english channel in 1979 
built of hightech composite materials graphite epoxy kevlar 
plastic fiber and mylar polystyrene film the daedalus plane has a 
huge 112foot wingspan and resembles an outsized insect in flight 
the flight in a fragile pedalpowered plane is aimed at 
emulating daedalus the legendary craftsman who flapped his way 
across the aegean on wings of wax and feathers according to a 
3500yearold greek myth 
according to the myth daedalus made it safely across the aegean 
but his son icarus flew too close to the sun and plummeted to his 
death as his wings melted

the young officer who led an august 
coup attempt that nearly felled president corazon aquinos 
government fled a prison ship in manila bay early today aided by 
his elite navy guards 
mrs aquino cut short a private easter holiday in northern luzon 
and rushed to the capital for an emergency cabinet meeting after 
hearing of the escape of former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan 
she told a national television audience honasan was to have been 
courtmartialed for leading the bloody aug 28 coup attempt in 
which at least 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded 
mrs aquino warned military personnel that those who assist or 
harbor honasan will be dealt with promptly and severely with the 
full force of the law 
the charismatic soldier escaped at about 230 am aboard two 
rubber boats along with 14 guards from the navys special warfare 
unit who were guarding him col oscar florendo chief military 
spokesman told reporters 
florendo said the roughly half dozen remaining guards fired on 
the boats as they slipped away in the darkness but apparently 
missed the prison ship the andres bonifacio was anchored 500 
yards from the navys main wharf he said 
chief of staff gen renato de villa ordered a nationwide search 
for the 39yearold honasan who had been on the ship since his 
december arrest in a manila suburb 
armored personnel carriers and bulldozers blocked entrances to 
military camps in manila and checkpoints were set up on major 
highways 
florendo said a reserve lieutenant who was frustrated over his 
inability to obtain a regular commission had aided in the escape 
it is believed that bribery was a factor the spokesman 
added saying the lieutenant and 13 enlisted personnel had 
apparently assisted and joined in the escape he said the boats 
used to flee had been sent to increase security after the military 
learned of a plot to free honasan 
florendo warned that honasan may try to organize a new bid to 
topple mrs aquino he said the government expected honasan to 
resume antiaquino propaganda efforts and again try to divide the 
military 
mrs aquino said honasan fled to avoid prosecution for mutiny 
and sedition arson murder and conduct unbecoming an officer she 
said his escape is tantamount to an admission of his guilt 
she also said honasan staged his coup attempt to evade 
investigation of alleged misapproriation of 100000 worth of 
military equipment and to avoid a combat assignment against 
communist rebels 
i appeal to all citizens and leaders public and private to 
assist us in the recapture of honasan as soon as possible she 
said 
presidential guards stepped up security around the presidential 
palace immediately after word of the escape civilians were barred 
from the palace compound 
defense secretary fidel v ramos said the military was taking 
every possible action to bring back honasan and minimize or 
neutralize any further damage that he can make 
honasan former defense ministry chief of security played a key 
role in the feb 22 1986 mutiny that with a popular uprising 
toppled president ferdinand marcos 
but he became disillusioned with mrs aquino accusing her of 
weak and inept leadership that fortified the 19yearold 
communist insurgency 
on aug 28 honasan led a force of 2000 men who attacked the 
presidential palace and seized several media and military 
installations in the capital before they were driven off by 
proaquino forces 
mrs aquino said the attack it was aimed at killing her and her 
family 
honasans was the most serious of several major plots to unseat 
mrs aquino the military says 11 officers and 90 enlisted men 
involved in the coup attempt are still at large 
honasan is widely regarded within the 160000member armed 
forces as a courageous experienced officer military sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said he is so popular he had 
become the dominant figure aboard the ship that was supposed to 
be his prison 
florendo said the military received information a week ago that 
honasan would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard the 
ship expecting outsiders to try to storm the vessel instead it 
came from the inside 
honasan was defense ministry security chief when opposition sen 
juan ponce enrile was minister of national defense enrile was 
fired in november 1986 after the government said it thwarted a coup 
attempt by his followers 
honasan remained in hiding for months after the august coup 
maj gen ramon montano former commander of the national 
capital regional defense command said weeks before the arrest that 
honasan was being protected by undisclosed civilian and military 
figures

publishing house say they have decided not to publish a book by a 
newark bishop who called for greater understanding of homosexual 
relationships and unmarried couples 
robert k feaster president of abingdon press in nashville 
tenn said in a news release that publishing episcopal bishop john 
shelby spongs book titled living in sin a bishop rethinks 
sexuality might be misinterpreted as support for spongs views

to encourage vigorous debate it has determined that the churchs 
publisher could appear to be aggravating fierce controversy rather 
than helping to find solutions feaster said in the release 
dated wednesday 
abingdon press officials did not answer calls to their offices 
friday 
in january with spongs backing representatives of northern 
new jerseys 125 episcopal parishes voted to give their blessing to 
homosexual relationships and unmarried couples and to minister to 
those people

a county judge said he has begun a 40day 
fast to demonstrate his credibility in the face of an attempt to 
remove him from the bench for allegedly making sexual advances to a 
male court reporter 
ramsey county district judge alberto miera who has denied the 
allegation said friday his bisexuality and the fact that he is 
hispanic have been factors in the attempt to remove him 
i feel obligated to do that to prevent this kind of abuse and 
injustice from happening to other individuals who are socially 
vulnerable and to encourage people to recognize that they have to 
stand up and fight even though there may be costs said miera 
who will take liquids throughout the fast and have one meal every 
other day 
the state board on judicial standards in february recommended 
miera be removed for allegedly making sexual advances to his former 
male court reporter and for other judicial misconduct the judge 
was convicted last year of battery for forcibly kissing the former 
court reporter 
the state supreme court temporarily suspended him march 9 to 
consider the recommendation arguments are scheduled may 24 
its not me thats the issue anymore miera said its the 
concept of justice its the concept of how we treat people its 
the concept of whether we treat people differently because were 
fearful of what they represent he said

iraq said today that its forces have 
overrun kurdish guerrilla bases in the mountainous northeast in an 
offensive aimed at crushing iranianbacked rebels who threaten 
vital oilfields 
kurdish guerrilla leaders have claimed the iraqis backed by 
tanks and air strikes were dropping poison gas bombs on villages 
in what one commander called a war of genocide 
baghdad radio monitored in nicosia quoted a military 
communique as saying its troops completely purged the area 
around qara dagh in the sulaimaniyeh region 50 miles west of the 
kirkuk oilfields 
qara dagh is only 20 miles west of lake darbandikhan where 
iranian revolutionary guards have thrust into iraq in a 16dayold 
offensive 
all traitors have finally been destroyed the communique 
declared in a reference to the iranianbacked kurdish rebels who 
have been fighting baghdad for an independent homeland for years 
there was no independent confirmation 
jalal talabani leader of the patriotic union of kurdistan told 
the associated press that heavy fighting was raging in the region 
friday but that he had no reports of an iraqi breakthrough 
massud barzani leader of the iranianbacked kurdish democratic 
party said in a statement several days ago that the iraqi army 
had launched a major offensive against the guerrillas march 23 
he said two divisions of troops backed by tanks artillery and 
air strikes were seeking to dislodge kurdish fighters from the 
qara dagh mountains between kirkuk and the provincial capital of 
sulaimaniyeh 
an iraqi division usually numbers about 12000 men 
barzani said the iraqi assaults had been beaten back 
he claimed iraqi warplanes were dropping chemical bombs on 
kurdish strongholds and villages suspected of harboring guerrillas 
the villages were north of the iranian bridgehead around lake 
darbandikhan where iran claims iraqi chemical bombing attacks 
march 1617 killed 5000 civilians and injured as many more 
talabani said the iraqis had seized some villages he also 
charged the iraqi air force was dropping gas bombs on kurdish 
settlements 
its a war of genocide against the kurdish people he said 
in a telephone interview they use chemical weapons against us 
all the time and raze our villages 
todays communique said an iraqi force including kurdish 
fighters loyal to baghdad had overrun 21 kurdish bases and 
villages used by the guerrillas in the last few days it gave no 
casualty figure 
the kurdish guerrillas have in the last 18 months created a 
second front in the 7yearold iraniraq war the iraqis have had 
to divert tens of thousands of troops badly needed in the main 
battle zones in the south to contain the insurgency in kurdistan 
the kurds claimed to control 4000 square miles in the northeast 
about 20 million kurds live in the mountainous region where the 
borders of iran iraq syria and turkey meet

the marxist government imposed huge 
price inceases on food and a government newspaper said saturday 
that the increases were necessitated by a guerrilla war that has 
ravaged the economy 
prices for rice sugar corn cooking oil bread and soap all 
rose sharply under governmentmandated increases that took effect 
friday in the southern african nation in a bid to offset the 
higher food prices the government also granted wage increases to 
some workers 
rice went from 9 cents to 60 cents per kilogram about 22 
pounds corn flour rose from nine cents to 32 cents per kilogram 
and a kilogram of sugar went from 11 cents to 59 cents 
the minimum wage for an industrial worker has been raised from 
about 17 a month to 29 per month however raises were not 
granted to workers in factories that were losing money 
mozambique also has a high unemployment rate and thousands of 
refugees displaced by a war raging since the 1960s mozambique won 
independence from portugal in 1975 after years of fighting since 
then guerrillas of the mozambique national resistance have been 
battling to oust the marxist government 
the daily newspaper noticias in an editorial saturday blamed 
the countrys economic woes on the continued and systematic 
aggression against mozambique carried out by the racist regimes of 
the region first rhodesia and later south africa 
in the mid1970s then whiteruled rhodesia helped backed the 
antimarxist guerrillas after rhodesia became blackruled zimbabwe 
in 1980 south africa began supplying the rebels 
south africa and mozambique signed a mutual nonaggression pact 
in 1984 but both sides regularly accuse the other of violations 
noticias said foreign support of the rebels has destabilized 
mozambique and has prevented us from consolidating our 
independence and developing our economy 
mozambique devastated by more than 20 consecutive years of 
war is currently one of the poorest countries in the world 
noticias said the state can no longer go on paying food 
subsidies 
an estimated 5 million of mozambiques 145 million people are 
in need of food aid 
in other developments government troops killed 38 rebel 
fighters in clashes during the past week in three separate 
provinces the national news agency aim said 
the rebels were killed in clashes from march 2931 in the 
central provinces of sofala and zambazia and the northwestern 
province of tete aim said citing a report on radio mozambique 
the report made no mention of government troop casualties

soviet officials negotiating with the united 
states on halving nuclear arsenals no longer believe they will have 
an agreement to sign by the time president reagan visits next 
month wellplaced soviet sources say 
the ruling politburo officially remains determined to work 
intensively for the speediest drafting of a set of documents to 
have them ready for signing at the moscow summit but soviet 
officials said privately they do not sense a similar urgency on the 
american side 
reagan is scheduled to meet soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
in moscow may 29 to june 2 at the fourth ussoviet summit since 
gorbachev came to power three years ago 
one source familiar with the negotiations said the united states 
still has not responded directly to four specific proposals 
gorbachev put forward at his last meeting with us secretary of 
state george p shultz in february 
they dont appear to be in a position to make decisions at 
this point the analyst said of the american negotiators 
speaking on condition he not be identified the source said 
there are major substantive issues outstanding on how to cut 
both sides strategic arsenals by 50 percent even before 
consideration of the us star wars program for a spacebased 
shield against nuclear attack disputes over that program have 
blocked agreement in the past 
the concept of a 50 percent cut has been accepted by both sides 
but the issue is complicated by the differing numbers and types of 
weapons in each sides arsenals 
the source said the two sides remain far apart on how to reduce 
mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles which make up an 
important element of the soviet arsenal and on cuts in 
sealaunched cruise missiles 
chief us arms negotiator max kampelman acknowledged 
differences in those areas as well as others in testifying before 
congress last week 
a western diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the united states is pressing for a ban on mobile icbms such 
as the soviet ss25 because it would be too difficult if not 
impossible to verify the number of such weapons remaining in the 
soviet arsenal after an agreedupon number had been destroyed 
the soviets the diplomat said are pressing to include 
sealaunched cruise missiles in any agreement but us negotiators 
contend they should be left out because no acceptable verifications 
measures exist to ensure compliance 
a soviet source said and the diplomat confirmed that the 
soviets have proposed a joint project to test a verification 
procedure using airborne electronic sensors us negotiators have 
expressed doubts such sensors could tell one nuclear weapon from 
another or from a ships nuclear reactor 
we proposed a way to verify sealaunched weapons a soviet 
official said they told us they didnt think it would work but 
they havent come up with any other plan 
another soviet analyst in the communist party apparatus said he 
suspects the us side has concluded the soviets are so anxious for 
an agreement that the reagan administration can gain more 
concessions by holding out longer 
kampelman said the united states is still trying to conclude an 
agreement before the summit but he too was skeptical 
achievement of a treaty in that time frame is possible but it 
will be difficult given the number and complexity of issues which 
remain unresolved kampelman said

bombs planted by the afghan intelligence 
agency created and run by the soviet kgb have killed more than 
400 civilians in pakistan according to us and pakistani 
officials 
pakistan has balked at signing a united nationsbrokered deal 
calling for an end to covert us aid to afghan guerrillas at the 
same time that moscow stops aiding the the kabul regime 
the bombings definitely have people worried they are designed 
to get pakistan to sign the geneva agreement but the government 
has stuck to its position said a pakistani official he like 
us intelligence sources interviewed about the bombings spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the afghan ministry for state security or wad is a mirror 
image of the kgb combining domestic and foreign intelligence 
activities with military functions said one us intelligence 
analyst 
a state department report issued last year said wad had 20000 
agents although some us and pakistani officials put the number 
at 30000 wad has its own uniformed military units and assigns 
officers to regular military units to bolster discipline according 
to the state department 
wad has 1500 advisers from the kgb which has run it since 
since shortly after the coup that brought marxists to power in 
april 1978 the sources said 
the most recent terrorist episode was last thursday when a bomb 
exploded in a poultry shop near the afghan border killing seven 
people and injuring 18 
the bloodiest incident was last july 14 when three car bombs 
exploded at the main bazaar of karachi the largest city in 
pakistan killing 72 and injuring 260 
wad staged about a dozen bombings inside pakistan in 1985 20 in 
1986 and more than 100 in 1987 said a second us analyst they 
are continuing at about the same rate this year 
among recent bombings attributed to wad 
feb 22 one person was killed and two others were hurt by a 
bomb in a popular hotel in bajaur in the northwest frontier 
province 
feb 23 a boy was killed by a bomb in his home in bajaur the 
same day another bomb destroyed a shop owned by an afghan refugee 
in the city 
feb 27 five people were killed and 11 injured by a bomb in a 
motorcycle in a in the main bazaar in thal a refugee center in the 
northwest frontier province 
march 1 two people were killed and two others were injured 
when a bomb exploded in peshawar a city in northern pakistan 
crowded with afghan refugees 
march 18 a letterbox exploded at a bus station in rawalpindi 
setting fire to an empty bus 
march 25 nine people were injured one critically by a bomb 
at a bus stand in rawalpindi 
diplomats at the afghan embassy in washington declined to 
comment on wad or any other subject 
the bombings started in 1985 about when mikhail s gorbachev 
became general secretary of the soviet communist party and the 
current afghan leader known by the single name of najibullah left 
the afghan intelligence agency to become secretary in the ruling 
party say us and pakistani sources 
najibullah trained as a physician in kabul became party leader 
in 1986 and head of state last year col geb ghulam farouq yaqubi 
now runs wad which until last year was known as the committee for 
state security or khad 
clearly sometime in 1985 moscow decided it had to increase 
pressure on pakistan and began crossborder air raids in afghan 
warplanes piloted by soviets and afghans said one us government 
source 
but the air raids backfired said the source the united 
states came very close to selling pakistan hightechnology airborne 
warning and control awacs planes to track the intruders a sale 
that was opposed by india a friend of the soviet union and an 
enemy of pakistan 
instead wad stepped up the terror bombing and there hasnt 
been so much of a reaction said the source 
the initial bombings were aimed at the 3 million afghan refugees 
who live just inside pakistan crossing the border to wage their 
guerrilla war against the estimated 115000 soviet troops backing 
the kabul regime 
the campaign became more serious said a pakistani official 
when the bombs began to explode in major cities like islamabad 
rawalpindi and lahore far from the refugees deep in the heart of 
pakistan 
afghan intelligence under soviet tutelage recruits agents to 
plant the bombs which analysts describe as crude and 
consisting in part of sovietmade components 
we have arrested a lot of these guys and they say they are 
paid by the kabul government said the pakistani official they 
include pakistanis and afghans who are drawn from the same 
ethnic groups and cross the border easily he said 
for each bombing they are paid several hundred dollars a 
huge amount of money in such an impoverished area said the 
official for killing they get more

in the best of times which these 
are not life was no cinch in san miguelito 
but a general strike aimed at overthrowing the regime of gen 
manuel antonio noriega closed panamas banks and much of its 
business and sent the poor suburbs unemployment even higher the 
few who have jobs often cant cash their checks to buy food because 
of governmentordered banks closures and us financial sanctions 
betteroff panamanians had cash at home or were able to withdraw 
some before the banks closed and by buying only essentials they 
are managing to get by 
but in the hillside shacks of san miguelito that option didnt 
exist 
hunger spread so rapidly that the parish churches which were 
distributing food have had to pass the job to caritas a roman 
catholic relief organization and content themselves with trying to 
catalogue the soaring need 
they are giving out 3500 meals a day in my parish said the 
rev reynaldo karamanites who heads the samaria parish in san 
miguelito three days earlier he said the number was 2800 
in 1980 there were about 80000 people in the parish and 
44000 were unemployed he said add at least 30 percent to the 
unemployment figure now 
unemployment always has been bad said the rev jorge 
altafulla of the slightly less impoverished san miguelito parish of 
christ the redeemer a lot of people here had only occasional day 
work and now they have lost even that 
caritas is feeding about 9000 families in the province of 
panama which includes the capital and the number is soaring most 
of the 9000 are in san miguelito 
the caritas food is donated or bought with donated money 
we keep praying that people will give more food and money 
said the rev laurino duran who heads caritas in the panama city 
area 
he said donations are meeting the present need but worried about 
the near future 
weve received nothing from the government said ursinis de 
castillo who helped dish out cooked rice and scrambled eggs to 
residents of sector 28 where she lives in christ the redeemer 
parish all we have is the church and our community 
some people from the government were here with 100 bags of 
food to sell to government workers said one man they charged 
1560 
yesterday caritas brought rice with chicken said soia de 
aguilar who was waiting for food they try to see that everybody 
has enough but each family gets the same and some families have 
eight or nine members 
caritas started giving food to churches to distribute starting 
in early march after banks closed because a political crisis had 
sparked panic among depositors 
on march 3 the united states froze panamanian funds in american 
banks one of several steps intended to force noriega from power 
noriega head of panamas armed forces and the power behind the 
civilian government is under indictment on drug trafficking 
charges in the united states the freezing of funds deprived panama 
of its supply of dollars the official panamanian currency and on 
march 4 noriega ordered the banks to remain closed 
the churches stopped trying to hand out the caritas packages 
last week when the crowds got too big too fast and now the food is 
brought to central distribution points cooked over wood fires and 
distributed to the list of the neediest compiled by the church 
even if banks were to reopen they are critically short of 
dollars because of the american freeze the government has been 
unable to pay most of its 130000 employees and the banks likely 
would have trouble producing dollars to cover checks waiting to be 
cashed 
generally stores insist on cash and will not take checks or 
credit cards 
caritas officials say it now requires about 600000 in 
donations a month to keep the people it feeds supplied with basics 
such as rice beans cooking oil and powdered milk in sector 28 a 
caritas worker said the list of families deemed eligible is growing 
by five or six families a day and that the increase is higher in 
other areas 
a few people here worked for the government a few had other 
jobs all sorts of jobs said mrs de aguilar thats san 
miguelito we do a little of everything and a lot of nothing

efforts to wrap up farm provisions of the 
1000page trade bill are snagged over a plan by sen tom harkin 
diowa to pump 75 million a year into crop research every year 
for 20 years 
the plan is designed principally to spur demand for corn and 
soybeans by finding new nonfood uses for them leading to higher 
farm earnings its really a longterm agricultural bill an 
investment in the future press secretary pam mckinney says 
thus far house negotiators on the trade bill arent so sure 
the plan would be a boon for iowa state university and similar 
research centers but could whet other lawmakers appetites for more 
of the same for the folks back in their own states 
the chairman of the house agriculture committee e kika de 
la garza dtexas has been cool toward the notion thus far and 
for that reason farm lawmakers were still wrangling late in the 
week when most other conferees on the trade bill had reached 
tentative agreement 
it now appears unlikely that the matter will be resolved until 
after april 11 when congress returns from its spring break 
as big as it is the plant research provision is small potatoes 
compared to some of the subsidy programs that do have tentative 
approval from the trade conferees 
chief among them is a socalled triggered marketing loan 
program similar to export subsidies contained in the 1985 farm 
law that sent us cotton and rice exports skyrocketing but at a 
hefty price to taxpayers 
the latest proposal focuses on the reagan administrations goal 
of using the current uruguay round of trade talks to start the 
united states and its trading partners on a course of phasing out 
all agricultural subsidies 
failure to make substantial progress on such an agreement by 
1990 would trigger the estimated 500 million marketing loan 
program designed to boost exports of wheat feed grains and oilseed 
crops 
soybean farmers have been clamoring for a marketing loan 
program under which producers receive pricesupport loans from the 
government as usual pay them off at the lower world price of the 
crop and pocket the difference 
even if uruguay round talks bogged down the next president 
could refuse to put the 1990 marketing loan into effect if he were 
prepared to assure congress that the subsidy program would would 
harm the international negotiations 
doing that however would trigger one of the trade packages 
most expensive and complex features an offshoot of the 1985 
export enhancement program which has sent millions of dollars in 
governmentowned surplus crops to private exporters 
big grain companies and other exporting firms receive the 
surplus crops as bonuses to spur overseas shipments of american 
farm products 
the program remains in effect and the trade proposal would 
extend it through 1990 and boost the price tag from 15 billion to 
25 billion 
a presidential waiver of the marketing loan would automatically 
trigger a new export program requiring the government to pay out 
no less than 2 billion in additional surpluscrop bonuses these 
bonuses represent a heavy cost to taxpayers because the commodities 
were acquired mainly through unredeemed pricesupport loans to 
farmers

it is the evening of april 4 1968 the 
rev martin luther king jr leans over a balcony railing at the 
lorraine motel the crack of a single shot from a highpowered 
rifle shatters the air 
suddenly hes gone 
this much is clearly documented but who killed the 39yearold 
civil rights leader and winner of the nobel peace prize 
james earl ray the smalltime thief who pleaded guilty has 
spent the past 20 years trying to prove he didnt do it he talks 
of a shadowy raoul 
other principals in the case hold widely varying opinions rays 
attorneys disagree on whether he was the triggerman the prosecutor 
acknowledges he wasnt confident about the case us rep louis 
stokes dohio the chairman of a congressional committee that 
studied the assassination says he still concurs with the 
committees findings that ray may have been part of a larger 
unsolved conspiracy 
the questions remain what of the cigarette butts found in the 
getaway car given that ray did not smoke what of the clothing in 
two sizes in the cars trunk 
the fatal shot came from a communal bathroom at the rear of a 
flophouse across a narrow street from the lorraine motel ray 
maintains he was not in that bathroom when the shot was fired 
i was a few blocks away trying to get a tire fixed on my 
car he said in a recent interview with the associated press at 
brushy mountain state prison where he is serving a 99year 
sentence when i started back to my room i saw a police roadblock 
had been set up it was about that time that i heard on my car 
radio king had been shot and the police were looking for a man in a 
white mustang the same kind of car i was driving so i took off 
for atlanta 
ray who had checked into the rooming house the day king was 
killed said he was in memphis to take part in an illicit 
gunrunning scheme he said the scheme was concocted by a mystery 
man named raoul an international smuggler whom ray contends he met 
several months earlier at a waterfront bar in montreal 
he also says raoul whom he describes as a blond man with a 
latin american accent set him up to be framed for kings murder 
the fact is i dont know who killed king said ray who 
recently turned 60 i only pleaded guilty because i was 
desperate i had been in isolation for eight months in the memphis 
jail and percy foreman was pressuring me to cop a plea he was 
telling me my family would get in trouble and id get the death 
penalty if i didnt do what he said 
foreman the houston attorney who represented ray when he 
entered his guilty plea march 10 1969 angrily disputes these 
assertions 
the sob got down on his knees and thanked me for saving his 
life when i told him i had gotten the prosecutor to go along with a 
guilty plea foreman said when contacted in houston recently 
foreman now in his mid80s says he thinks ray was extremely 
fortunate not to have stood trial he also rejects rays story 
about raoul i think he acted alone he said 
asked what might have motivated ray to commit such an act 
foreman said it was racism his conversations simply steamed 
with racist remarks 
ray who was a fugitive from the missouri state penitentiary at 
the time king was killed denies he harbored any ill will toward 
king and defies anyone to prove otherwise 
king was just another politician to me he said why would 
i want to do something like kill a bigshot politician me a 
fugitive and bring all that heat down on myself 
he admits buying the rifle a remington gamemaster 3006 
caliber that authorities say was the murder weapon but he says he 
bought at a birmingham ala gun shop at raouls instruction and 
with money provided by raoul 
i gave the rifle to raoul ray said if i had been buying 
it to kill king you can bet i wouldnt have bought it at a gun 
shop i would have gotten it from a fence so it couldnt have been 
traced 
birmingham lawyer arthur hanes sr said he tends to believe that 
story he represented ray for four months before foreman 
ive never believed ray shot king said hanes a former fbi 
agent and onetime birmingham mayor i personally stood in that 
flophouse bathroom and looked across to the motel balcony where the 
rev king was standing when he was shot it was a difficult angle 
ray simply didnt have enough expertise with rifles to make a shot 
like that in my opinion 
hanes also said he had never heard ray utter a single racist 
statement 
ive given this case a lot of thought and ive concluded 
someone assisted ray he added but i cant say who 
the case should have gone to trial he said to clear the air 
if nothing else i tried to get the judge to try the case but he 
said there was too much pressure from the government and the 
memphis business community to accept a guilty plea and avoid the 
publicity that a trial would generate 
the judge w preston battle died a week after rays guilty 
plea however the chief prosecutor philip canale acknowledged 
last week that contrary to foremans assertion he had been happy 
to get a plea from ray 
it would have been a big timeconsuming and expensive trial 
with dozens and dozens of witnesses from all over the country 
said canale now an assistant us attorney in memphis i have 
never regretted the guilty plea because we got a substantial 
sentence also i didnt want to take a chance on getting a cranky 
juror and having a mistrial

canale added that although he had no eyewitness and the evidence 
against ray was largely circumstantial he doesnt buy the 
conspiracy theory 
i think he acted alone he said noting that the fbi had 
found rays fingerprint on the rifle discarded by the gunman near 
the scene of the crime 
however supporters of rays story say his fingerprint was on 
the rifle because he had purchased it they also note that while 
ray is a lifelong nonsmoker viceroy cigarette butts were found in 
the rooming house bathroom and in his car ashtray and that two 
sizes of clothing were found in his trunk 
ray said the fact that raoul often used his car may explain the 
butts in the ashtray and clothes in the trunk as for cigarettes 
in the bathroom i cant say because i was never in that bathroom 
he said my prints were never found in there you know 
then there were the two white mustangs the late guy canipe 
whose amusement company was located next door to the flophouse 
told investigators he saw a fleeing man ditch a rifle and a small 
overnight bag in front of his store and then drive away in a white 
mustang one of two that had been parked in front of the store that 
afternoon he described the man as having dark hair and a beard 
ray who was captured in london two months after kings death 
says the fact that the gunman ditched the rifle and his bag which 
ray says he had left in his room when he went to get the tire fixed 
shows somebody was trying to frame him 
why would i have dumped my stuff there for the police to find 
when all i had to do was put it in the car and drive away he 
asked 
after two years of hearings ending in 1978 the house select 
committee on assassinations couldnt answer that question the 
committee issued a report saying ray probably had been part of a 
larger conspiracy 
but while the committee couldnt say who else had participated 
in the plot it did exonerate the cia and fbi both of which had 
conducted extensive illegal surveillance and smear campaigns 
against king throughout the 1960s former fbi director j edgar 
hoover was known to have hated king 
fbi agents testified that no evidence could be found of 
conspiracies involving the mafia ku klux klan or foreign 
communists 
some of kings friends however still feel that letting 
hoovers fbi investigate kings assassination was like letting a 
hungry fox guard a henhouse 
i have no proof but i feel in my heart that the government 
probably the fbi and j edgar hoover and perhaps the cia were 
involved says the rev ralph david abernathy who was with king 
when he died in a memphis hospital an hour after the shooting 
its just a pity but given the way things were back then 
well probably never know the whole truth about one of the greatest 
tragedies of our time

when the clock jumps forward an hour for 
daylightsaving time at 2 am sunday morning it means a little 
more than a lost hour of sleep 
peoples stomachs will be telling them snickers bar and 
well be serving lunch but if youre an early eater itll be 
beneficial said jeff manzer manager of the chattanooga 
riverboat company 
the firm plans to serve an easter brunch on the tennessee river 
sunday afternoon but the time change will probably affect 
peoples appetites said manzer 
businesses and services that work on into the night lost an hour 
or gained an hour depending on the point of view 
some police officers who work the night shift get to go home an 
hour early they dont lose an hours pay for their early 
departure and when the time changes back in the fall theyll get 
an hours overtime pay officials said friday 
firefighters who work 24hour shifts are in the same situation 
some churches will hold additional services for sleepyheads and 
for the holiday crowds 
going visiting for easter the nations public transportation 
system is ready for the switch said fred waymack manager of a 
nashville travel agency 
at some points there are some minor changes in schedules but 
for most airlines cruise ships and trains its just another day 
on the job waymack said 
most of the schedule changes come about because of the season 
not daylightsaving time he said some flight times might be 
adjusted one or two minutes because of changes in headwinds 
waymack said and others might be changed to accommodate peak 
passenger loads 
its really a very sophisticated system waymack said 
theyve had a number of years since the wright brothers to 
perfect it 
but he urged passengers to doublecheck departures 24 hours in 
advance 
at first tennessee bank in memphis spokesman bob young said the 
time change would have little effect on most banking services 
however he said there might be a moments hesitation when 
computer operators key in the commands to switch times on the 
banking computers automated tellers and other equipment 
it just depends on how quickly an operator can enter it in 
young said 
recorded time and temperature announcements must be changed 
along with signs at banks shopping malls and stores teresa 
birdsong assistant to the general manager at nashvilles wyhyfm 
said she will have to come to the station at 2 am sunday morning 
to make the change in the time and temperature announcement 
computer 
bank and store signs are also changed by computer usually by 
the owner of the sign said mark allison owner of allison sales 
and marketing 
the time works off an internal clock which you reset just as 
you would a digital clock allison said 
time clocks must also be changed before workers punch in monday 
morning most computerized time clocks will make the change 
automatically but there will still be thousands of older models 
that need to be changed by hand said southern time services 
technician bill asplint 
we could be doing daylightsaving time changes for the next 
two weeks he said 
this is the second year that daylightsaving time will begin on 
the first sunday in april before congress changed the law the 
time switch occurred on the last sunday of april

strikes demonstrations and tensions between 
national groups in two southern soviet republics have quieted but 
economic damage from the unrest is severe newspapers reported 
saturday 
official and dissident sources said the atmosphere in the 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan was improving but in moscow 
activist sergei grigoryants said ethnic relations remained volatile 
at a news conference at his north moscow apartment the 
halfarmenian former political prisoner said he had spoken with 
sources in armenia who told him tensions have eased there and in 
the disputed region of nagornokarabakh in neighboring azerbaijan 
however he said he was told some residents of stepanakert 
nagornokarabakhs main city remained on strike 
armenian activists want nagornokarabakh which is mostly 
armenian annexed to armenia at least 32 people have died in 
ethnic violence in the region since late february in bloody clashes 
between azeris and armenians 
grigoryants said the stepanakert airport had been reopened for 
local residents but that frequent document checks were being made 
at all roads leading into the region to keep outsiders away 
workers in stepanakert angered over the kremlins failure to 
issue a clear decision on appeals to annex the region have been 
staying home for more than a week 
official newspapers acknowledged labor unrest continued but 
said more people have been showing up for work in the beginning 
virtually the entire adult population went out on strike 
the communist party newspaper pravda carried an interview with 
armenian scholar gevorg garibdzhanyan who accused the staterun 
press of telling a onesided story about the nagornokarabakh 
situation and being too quick to label armenian activists as 
extremists 
but he also defended the presence of soviet troops in the 
armenian capital of yerevan saying he slept peacefully knowing 
our soldiers were in the city 
it appeared from his comments that the armed security troops 
that patrolled the city last month had been reduced 
foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to the 
caucasus region and telephone contact with the area has been 
disrupted 
the national television news program vremya reported friday that 
public transport and many major industries in stepanakert had been 
idled by the strikes and urged residents of the area to go back to 
work 
the daily sovietskaya rossiya said saturday that some workers 
showed up at major enterprises in the city of stepanakert on friday 
for the first time in more than a week although the factories were 
still not up to full strength 
an editor who answered the telephone at the soviet karabakh 
newspaper in stepanakert on saturday said the labor situation was 
returning to normal in the city but declined to give his name or 
details 
selskaya zhizn newspaper wrote that state and collective farms 
in the troubled region had lost nearly 775000 by midmarch 
because of strikes and demonstrations shortages of meat milk and 
eggs have resulted the newspaper said 
even larger losses have been reported in recent days due to the 
industrial strikes in stepanakert where production and deliveries 
ground to a halt over the past week 
nagornokarabakh has been part of the azerbaijan republic since 
1923 although more than threequarters of the regions 160000 
residents are armenians armenians are predominantly christian 
while most azeris are shiite moslems 
the labor situation worsened in stepanakert in midmarch when 
the soviet leadership called armenian agitation for 
nagornokarabakhs annexation intolerable 
while apparently rejecting the bid for reuniting the region with 
armenia the party and government leadership unveiled a program to 
invest 690 million in housing and social services like 
armenianlanguage schools literature and broadcasting

secretary of state george p shultz insisted 
saturday on the ouster of gen manuel antonio noriega but 
sidestepped a report that he had recommended kidnapping the 
panamanian strongman 
shultz predicted he would see a little headway when he again 
takes up his plan for mideast peace talks next week with arab and 
israeli leaders shultz called on palestinians to participate in 
the negotiations but he again ruled out talks with the palestine 
liberation organization 
obviously there are some we wont meet with shultz said as 
he reiterated the 13yearold us policy of not dealing with the 
plo until it accepts iraels right to exist 
shultz held the news conference after receiving pope john paul 
iis blessing at the vatican for his new venture in the middle east 
that begins sunday evening in jerusalem the pope stressed any 
accord must respect the legitimate rights of both israelis and 
palestinians 
the vatican does not have diplomatic relations with israel nor 
does it recognize its control of oncedivided jerusalem the 
israeli capital 
the los angeles times reported friday that shultz recommended 
kidnapping noriega and fomenting a military coup coordinated with 
the central intelligence agency 
the newspaper also said shultz and elliott abrams the assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs suggested landing 
more than 3000 us soldiers to encourage panamanian military 
officers to move against noriega 
the proposal was strongly opposed by the cia and defense 
secretary frank c carlucci who labeled it dangerous and 
illtimed said the times quoting unidentified adniminstration 
officials 
asked if he made such recommendations shultz said the 
position of the us government is that noriega should go 
everybody agrees about that hes been indicted on drug charges 
in a lengthy reply shultz said the panamanian people have 
demonstrated they agree with the united states in opposing noriega 
he said us forces in panama were being increased to guard the 
panama canal 
we debate various possible options shultz said but 
basically this is a question of a person who is no longer welcome 
in his own country by his own people and he should leave 
when another reporter suggested shultz had not really answered 
the question shultz showed some irritation and said i never 
comment on speculative newspaper articles 
told us officials reportedly had described a kidnapping plot 
as harebrained shultz said i never comment on particularly 
harebrainedtype proposals 
he also refused to say whether the united states would seek 
noriegas extradition to face criminal charges 
shultz and his wife helena are spending a leisurely weekend in 
the italian capital and planned to attend the popes easter mass in 
st peters square 
shultz also held a series of meetings with italian government 
officials 
he praised italy for its willingness to host the 72 us f16 
jet fighter planes that spain is expelling in 1991 
on the middle east shultz said he had no further word from 
arabs and israelis on whether they would accept his proposal but 
we expect to see a little headway 
his plan calls for negotiations to begin may 1 on arrangements 
for selfrule for the 15 million palestinians on the israeliheld 
west bank and in gaza 
israel would deal directly with a joint delegation of jordan and 
palestinians in december negotiations on an overall settlement of 
the 40year arabisraeli dispute would open also with syrias 
participation 
shultz said he would keep working for peace even if he were 
turned down on his second trip to the region in a month 
the problem is there he said everybody recognizes it 
and the problem isnt going to go away 
shultz said after talking with arab and israeli leaders he could 
feel it in my bones there is an answer out there if you can only 
find it

thousands of dead african desert locusts have shown 
up on beaches just outside rome the coast guard reported saturday 
prompting concerns some swarms might reach italy alive 
coast guard officials said winds must have pushed the insects 
from northern africa toward italy and that they died in the cold 
weather 
the italian press expressed concern that warmer weather might 
allow future swarms of locusts to survive and thrive the rome 
daily il tempo described the scene on the beach as the sign of a 
narrowly missed invasion or worse of an invasion that lies at the 
gates 
but experts have said italy will not be hit by the same invasion 
of locusts that has spread over morocco tunisia algeria and 
libya last month the romebased un food and agriculture 
organization described the insect invasion in north africa as the

the reagan administration has 
considered a number of military alternatives to oust panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega but has rejected them president 
reagans chief spokesman said today 
asked about a flurry of news reports that secretary of state 
george p shultz was pushing a bold military or covert move to get 
noreiga out fitzwater said the panamanian problem has presented 
fertile ground for a rich imagination about possible solutions 
but the united states intentions are to protect our citizens 
and our assets there he said 
there have been any number of offensive plans raised but to 
this point they have been rejected he added 
reagan who has started a 10day easter vacation at his 
mountaintop ranch near here is closely watching the situation 
fitzwater said as the pentagon prepares to send 1300 us 
military personnel to strengthen the american military presence 
there 
shortly after reagan arrived in california friday the defense 
department announced that the additional troops would be deployed 
beginning next week to improve the security of us military 
installations in the troubled country 
the reagan administration for weeks has been applying economic 
and diplomatic pressure to force noriega out of power noriega has 
been indicted by a federal grand jury in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges 
fitzwater asked earlier this week if the administration was 
considering seizing noriega said no 
but the spokesman told reporters accompanying reagan to 
california on air force one on friday that the administration was 
still reviewing options aimed at securing noriegans departure 
the pentagon decision to send additional manpower many of them 
military police officers came in the wake of a march by panamanian 
troops on a panama city hotel earlier in the week during that 
incident several us journalists were detained briefly and 
authorities confiscated videotapes of four us television networks 
fitzwater said reagan would be kept abreast of several matters 
while the president and his wife nancy relax at rancho del cielo 
in the santa ynez mountains 
hell get daily intelligence updates on world situations 
the spokesman said he could get special information on three or 
four areas of interest one is panama a continuing problem to keep 
an eye on 
reagan also will be kept informed of any progress that shultz 
makes as he renews the administrations middle east peacemaking 
efforts with visits to several countries in the region 
the president also will be briefed on the goingson in 
nicaragua where the marxist sandinista regime is scheduled to 
enter talks with the contra rebels tuesday aimed at bringing about 
democratic reforms envisioned in a truce agreement signed march 23 
but the political and governmental crisis in panama seemed sure 
to take much of reagans attention 
reagan has sought to minimize the possibility of us military 
force being used to oust noriega last monday for instance he 
told high school students in vienna va he did not think the 
citizens of panama wanted to see the great colossus of the 
north flex its muscles there 
but the administration apparently has become increasingly 
frustrated as noriega has survived an array of economic sanctions 
these include the withholding of payments the united states makes 
to the panama canal commission under terms of the 1979 treaties 
providing for the canal to be gradually turned over to panama by 
the turn of the century 
in another effort to turn the financial screws on noriega the 
administration on thursday announced steps to stop us dollars 
from flowing into the central american nation 
the administration is concerned that the continuing flow of tax 
payments by american corporations with operations in panama has 
served to sustain the existing government headed by noriega 
the first family plans a quiet easter vacation which lasts 
through april 10 fitzwater said there were no plans for 
gettogethers at the ranch by reagan relatives and it could not be 
learned whether the first couple would leave the mountain to attend 
easter services here as they did last year 
reagans lone public outing is an appearance monday at a 
luncheon of some 75 supporters of the reagan presidential library 
he is scheduled to make a foreign policy address to a convention 
of the national association of broadcasters in las vegas nev en 
route back to washington on april 10

mormon church leaders today urged 
followers to love god above worldly success and prepare themselves 
for the second coming of jesus christ 
in the opening session of the 158th annual general conference of 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints leaders said 
service to god and love of christ should be the highest priority of 
the faithful 
we should put god ahead of everyone else in our lives said 
president ezra taft benson the 88yearold spiritual leader of the 
65 million member church 
when we put god first all other things fall into their proper 
places or drop out of our lives our love of god will govern the 
claims for our affection the demands on our time the interests we 
pursue and the order of our priorities benson said in prepared 
remarks 
the sermon was the first of three scheduled to be delivered by 
benson who has been convalescing from a heart attack the past six 
months church spokesman jerry cahill said benson who served as 
secretary of agriculture during the eisenhower administration 
appeared to be in good health and excellent spirits 
benson was one of 22 of the churchs general authorities 
scheduled to speak during the conferences five sessions general 
authorities are fulltime clergy who lead the church under the 
direction of the first presidency which consists of benson and 
counselors gordon b hinckley and thomas s monson 
thousands of lay clergymen and other church members from around 
the world have gathered for the twoday conference held in the 
tabernacle on temple square in downtown salt lake city

fundamental church doctrines such as belief in resurrection and 
atonement of jesus and the importance of missionary work

baptisms reached an alltime high during 1987 cahill said the 
exact figure would not be released prior to the afternoon session 
but said it was about 250000 he said the churchs fulltime 
volunteer missionary force also has reached an alltime high of 
34200 men and women 
neal a maxwell of the council of the twelve apostles urged 
church members to prepare for christs second coming but said they 
should not believe the rapture necessarily is near at hand 
the council of the twelve are second to the first presidency in 
the church hierarchy and assist in directing the church 
over the sweep of christian history by focusing on a few 
prophecies while neglecting others some believers have prematurely 
expected the second coming today while obviously closer to that 
great moment we are in the same danger maxwell said on the 
other hand smugness is also a real danger 
maxwell noted that a number of biblical prophecies said to be 
precursors of christs return already have occurred among them he 
said is the return of the jewish people to the holy land 
l tom perry of the council of the twelve said mormons should 
get involved in community affairs and promote honest government 
neighborhood beautification and high educational standards 
rather than spend time complaining about the direction in 
which these institutions are going we need to exert our influence 
in shaping the right direction a small effort by a few can result 
in so much good for all mankind he said

an apparent fuel spill stretched about 70 
miles down the ohio river today from near cincinnati to louisville 
ky according to the us coast guard 
at this point it smells like diesel fuel so we are assuming 
it is diesel fuel said lt eric mosher with the coast guard in 
louisville 
mosher said his agency had contacted water companies along the 
river and health officials in louisville 
our first step is trying to find a source and secure the 
source mosher said 
there is about a 1foot chop on the river right now to 
contain the oil is almost an impossibility he added 
sgt james hickerson with the indiana state police post in 
sellersburg said investigators had used a helicopter this morning 
to track the spill about 70 miles 
its not thick and heavy all the way but there are traces of 
it its heaviest between madison in jefferson county and clark 
county across the river from louisville he said 
we dont know exactly what it is some kind of petroleum he 
said 
one report i got from the police radio was that it was in 
spots as wide as the river they say it is a real thin film but 
they dont know if it is a fuel or a chemical said patrolman tim 
armstrong of the police department in madison about halfway 
between cincinnati and louisville 
armstrong said madison residents began reporting a strong diesel 
fuel smell friday night he said officials at the indianakentucky 
electric corp generating plant took a boat out to check the river 
and discovered the spill shortly after 630 am

consumer advocate ralph nader is criticizing 
the rise in postage rates and urging consumers to organize and 
insist on a voice in postal affairs 
the new postage rates including a 3cent rise in the cost of 
mailing a firstclass letter take effect sunday it will now cost 
25 cents to mail a letter 
nader termed the increase a harsh blow on individuals and 
said the postal service routinely hears from businesses and 
nonprofit groups about mail service and rates but not from the 
average consumer 
naders solution is to form a group called residential postal 
action 
if we can get 10000 people to write in we could escalate 
this to something significant he said in a recent telephone 
interview 
clearly there is a great imbalance of representation nader 
said and a consumer group can help even the scales 
the rate hike comes at a time when congressional budget cuts 
have forced the postal service to curtail window hours and some 
collections 
at the same time proposals to allow private firms to begin 
competing in the delivery of firstclass mail have been put forth 
this combination of factors threaten the stability of what was 
once a wellregarded public service nader said in a letter to 
postmaster general anthony frank nader urged frank to find ways to 
cut costs without reducing services 
he called on interested individuals to write to residential 
postal action po box 19367 washington dc 20036 
the group could be funded through voluntary member 
contributions nader said

democratic acting gov rose mofford has 
walked a tightrope in the nearly two months since republican gov 
evan mecham was impeached and from all appearances she has enjoyed 
nearly every minute of it 
shes everyones auntie rose said state rep cindy resnick 
and theres proof in the way children come up without prompting to 
hug the tall woman with the white beehive hairdo 
she may not be the kind of technocrat some people want her to 
be but she certainly knows people says democratic house 
minority leader art hamilton 
she moved quickly to calm arizonas troubled political waters 
after mecham was impeached on feb 5 and she as secretary of 
state took his office until he is acquitted or ousted her 
bipartisan volunteer staff included many who served under mechams 
predecessor democratic gov bruce babbitt 
with mechams fate up in the air pending a senate verdict on the 
house impeachment allegations plus an upcoming criminal trial and 
recall election mrs mofford has avoided any policy initiatives 
beyond indicating a willingness to consider tax hikes that mecham 
opposes 
mrs mofford did not seek a place on the ballot in the may 17 
recall election but a draft committee gathered enough petition 
signatures to put her on anyway and she is the favorite in a 
sevenway race 
a court challenge has been filed arguing that she cannot remain 
on the ballot unless she files a financial disclosure report if 
she files that she could be considered to be actively campaigning 
and that under arizona law would mean she would have to resign 
both as acting governor and as secretary of state 
god only knows what the future holds for rose mofford but im 
telling you while im sitting up there as acting governor im there 
to serve you she told a luncheon club in one of her many public 
appearances 
besides speaking at building dedications county fairs and 
countless luncheons and dinners she has posed for photos with 
school children cotton farmers mayors basketball players 
lawmakers annette funicello and mickey mouse as she goes she 
hands out mofford pens address books and watches 
when she isnt making speeches she can be found flipping 
through her three huge rotary files for the telephone number of 
those who are on her list of birthdays or anniversaries that day 
no matter who you want to see honey you call me ill 
probably know him she tells visitors 
in her 46 years in state government many of the roles shes 
filled have had little substance and there are conflicting views 
of how well she will do on heavier matters 
but a statewide poll released by the phoenix gazette last week 
gave mrs mofford an 81 percent approval rating for her job 
performance 
mecham is automatically on the ballot unless he is ousted via 
impeachment in a vote expected this week also on the ballot are 
another democrat two republicans and two minor candidates 
as secretary of state mrs moffords duties included such 
noncontroversial functions as keeping the states great seal 
attesting to official acts of government and handling government 
publications 
the office also keeps records on lobbyists and campaign 
financing and john anderson former executive director of the 
government watchdog organization arizona common cause says the 
state has done a poor job in that area 
i think they tried real hard he said of mrs mofford and 
the secretary of state staff but the system they used for 
maintaining any files that i was primarily interested in was not a 
good one 
records often were missing and there was no attempt to enforce 
or have the state attorney generals office enforce laws against 
violations anderson says 
mrs mofford was not really interested in the compliance end 
of things unless somebody made waves especially the press he 
said 
hamilton and other defenders of mofford note that she had to 
contend with a gopcontrolled legislature and was shortstaffed 
and anderson himself acknowledged that recordkeeping improved 
somewhat with addition of computers 
mrs mofford is divorced and has no children she began her 
government career in 1941 as a secretary and she has worked for or 
with 11 of the states 16 governors she was appointed assistant 
secretary of state in 1955 and secretary of state 22 years later 
she won the post in her own right in 1978 1982 and 1986 each time 
by wide margins 
her honeymoon in office is in sharp contrast to mecham who 
seemingly never had one 
mecham became the subject of criticism from the start over 
errors news conferences appointments hirings and firings and 
his cancellation of a state martin luther king holiday established 
by babbitt 
mrs mofford has drawn little public criticism in such areas 
and there also has been little stir over her generally having 
refused to voice her opinion on major pending bills 
i think rose is a very capable person said republican house 
speaker joe lane shes been very conciliatory toward me 
she doesnt offend folks said hamilton

father panik village a giant public 
housing project once called bridgeports greatest christmas 
gift has come unwrapped 
the mice run around like theyre paying the rent instead of 
you said brenda johnson president of the concerned tenants of 
father panik village 
people are a problem too theyre selling guns like its the 
old west and theyre dealing drugs in the open she said 
the project could lose millions of federal dollars if city 
officials dont follow orders to tear parts of it down partially 
reconstruct it and relocate about 1300 of the estimated 4000 
residents to other housing in bridgeport 
tenants of the complex claim that some of the 41 threestory 
buildings are in such poor shape and crime so pervasive that living 
there puts them in peril 
i would say its one of the worst projects in the country 
said tom sherman director of the office of public housing in the 
us department of housing and urban development 
several years ago the modernization money was not used 
properly and were afraid the bricks are going to pop off the 
buildings and someone could get killed sherman said in a 
telephone interview from washington dc 
you just cant have a dump sitting there and thats more or 
less what father panik is 
father panik village began as yellow mill village on dec 23 
1939 it was renamed in 1955 in honor of the rev stephen panik a 
roman catholic priest who served as the first chairman of the 
brideport housing authority and was considered a connecticut 
pioneer in lowrent housing projects 
for it means perhaps the greatest christmas gift that ever was 
given to the people of bridgeport not a promise but the 
beginning of a reality fine decent homes for about 5000 people at 
rentals that are well within their means panik said at a 
ceremony in 1939 
today the largest housing project in the states largest city 
looks like a battlefield gunshots occasionally echo within the 
project and drug deals are routinely made on street corners walls 
are marked with graffiti and the hallways smell of urine 
at least 90 percent of the residents are single parents with an 
average of two children and annual incomes of 5000 to 10000 
the federal government has given the bridgeport housing 
authority 36 million to demolish 13 buildings relocate residents 
to new quarters to be created around the city and rebuild some 
units 
hud is waiting to see if those directions are carried out before 
it makes plans or allocates any more money to improve the rest of 
the project 
sherman said the bha has been slow in submitting its plans 
we should have had the application for the demolition by the 
end of december and its not in yet he said well give them 
an extension but were kind of tired of giving them extensions 
he said if the city doesnt make progress by april 15 hell 
recommend cancelling the federal grant 
clarence craig executive director of the bha said the agency 
is determined to meet its deadlines 
all of the little pieces show were moving ahead craig said 
but so far the authority has located only 10 sites to fit 88 
apartments leaving them short of locations for 251 units that must 
be moved in the first phase of the project 
the problem is bridgeport does not have all of the resources 
to do things as quickly and well as hud would like said us 
rep christopher shays rconn it would be very selfdefeating 
if hud punished the residents and city for inadequacies that exist 
that were trying to work out 
meanwhile tenants of father panik are uneasy about the future 
said johnson president of the tenants group 
johnson who has lived in father panik for all but two of her 36 
years said that even if it is torn down and rebuilt crime 
problems will linger 
if they dont do something about the security here it doesnt 
matter if they call it mud johnson said 
mayor thomas w bucci said the village is one of the citys 
most important priorities 
it is known as being one of the worst housing complexes in the 
country and that reputation naturally is associated with the 
city bucci said its not moving as quickly as wed like but 
progress is being made

president reagan today urged 
congress to enhance federal support of scientific research saying 
we couldnt be where we are without such exploration 
in his weekly radio address delivered from reagans ranch in 
the santa ynez mountains the president said that while spending 
for scientific research is 58 percent higher than a decade ago 
after discounting for inflation this is insufficient 
he said that since world war ii the united states has won more 
nobel prizes for science than europe and japan combined and that 
this country must not lose its world leadership role 
he said that scientific research unlike the construction of 
bridges interstate highways and courthouses has no local 
constituency but reagan said the united states cannot let this 
political fact of life get in the way of continuing breakthroughs 
without such exploration we couldnt be where we are today 
he said we can travel as far as the eye of our imagination can

thief will be seeing the man in court again this time the young 
man is accused of stealing the judges car 
seattle district court judge philip y killien ruled there was 
no compelling reason to hold the teenager after he was arrested 
for investigation of driving a stolen car 
the judge decided to release the man although he had no job and 
no permanent address while police and prosecutors investigated 
the judges own car was stolen soon afterward 
killien said he thought the theft of his car march 22 was 
nothing more than a coincidence he got his car back four days 
later 
killien was expected to testify against the suspect who is 
charged in two other cases but has not not yet charged in the

a stateowned newspaper denied rebel 
charges that burmese government authorities carry out largescale 
drug trafficking 
kachin rebel leader brang seng last month told foreign 
correspondents that his forces overran a military outpost in 
burmas northern kachin state he said they captured 180 boxes 
filled with 5016 pounds of opium which he cited as evidence of 
government involvement in drug dealing 
but the burmese stateowned working peoples daily said in its 
report published wednesday and made available saturday in bangkok 
that the rebels found drugs stored for use as court evidence 
the article went on to accuse the kachin rebels one of several 
minority groups fighting the central government of smuggling jade 
heroin and opium to bankroll their activities 
burma is the worlds largest producer of opium with an 
anticipated harvest this season of up to 1200 tons officials say

with 23 more deaths reported saturday 
indias troubled state of punjab has suffered the bloodiest week 
since sikh rebels first began calling for a separate nation six 
years ago 
last weeks death toll of 120 has prompted calls for imposing a 
federal emergency in the northern state and already may have 
crippled the governments latest effort to reach a compromise with 
militants of the religious minority 
prime minister rajiv gandhi called the appointed governor of 
punjab state ss ray and state police chief julius f ribiero to 
new delhi on saturday to plan new initiatives against the violence 
ray told reporters that the government would keep up its 
relentless war against the sikh radicals who have been blamed 
for more than 630 killings this year 
the united news of india said sikh militants shot to death six 
people saturday night in the village of ragarh in amritsar 
district adding to the 17 deaths reported since friday night 
no new government actions were announced saturday but sikhs in 
punjab expressed fears that gandhis goverment would declare an 
emergency severely limiting civil rights and imposing harsh police 
rule 
this is an excuse by new delhi to impose emergency on the 
state darshan singh ragi a sikh religious leader said saturday 
at his home near punjabs capital chandigarh the bullet is not 
an answer to any problem either from the militants or new delhi 
at the same time opposition political leaders and some in 
gandhis congress party demanded action and three radical groups 
issued a statement blaming the latest killings on police agents 
all this is being done to defame the militant sikh youths in 
the eyes of the sikh masses so that the movement for khalistan is 
weakened said a statement from the radical groups 
lk advani leader of the opposition indian peoples party 
demanded in new delhi that gandhi impose a security belt along 
punjabs border with pakistan believed to be the source of the 
ak47 assault rifles used by the rebels in their latest onslaught 
past efforts to seal the porous border the traditional domain 
of smugglers on both sides have failed 
harsh police action exemplified by the indian armys raid on 
the sikhs golden temple in amritsar in 1984 has succeeded only in 
turning ordinary sikhs against the government 
the june 1984 raid to drive radicals from the shrine left more 
than 1200 people dead most of them sikhs soon afterwards sikh 
bodyguards killed prime minister indira gandhi who was gandhis 
mother sikh radicals began openly demanding an independent 
khalistan land of the pure in the punjabi language 
the killings are spiraling despite the gandhi governments 
direct federal rule over punjab since last may when it invoked 
indian law to dislodge the elected state government of sikh 
moderates 
in march alone 272 victims were gunned down compared to 215 
who died in the first three months of last year 
the latest police reports confirm the pattern of random killings 
with the victims both hindus and sikhs 
in the neighboring villages of tara and kaler in gurdaspur 
district two sets of hindu brothers in their 60s and 70s were 
shot to death friday night by four men with ak47 rifles 
in tara about 30 miles south of amritsar all but two of the 50 
houses in the village were deserted by families fleeing the 
persistent violence 
ram lal a hindu said he and a few other villagers had been 
coming during the day to mind their fields and shops after friday 
nights slayings he said we will not come back at all we are 
not able to stay here with the terror 
sikhs whose religion is a mixture of hinduism and islam make 
up only 2 percent of indias 800 million population but they are a 
majority in punjab 
the radicals argue that only a separate sikh nation can save the 
minority faith from being overwhelmed by the hindus who comprise 
more than 80 percent of the countrys people 
ironically some sikh sources say the upsurge in killings 
results from a new effort by the government to find a compromise 
with the militants through jasbir singh rode a 34yearold sikh 
preacher 
rode was among about 40 sikhs who were freed in early march 
after being imprisoned without trial he was promptly elected to 
the most powerful post in the sikh faith amid reports his freedom 
was part of a government move to compromise with the radicals or 
divide them 
rode has denied there were any conditions to his release and 
the government has not publicly outlined its plans 
gandhi was asked in an interview published saturday in londons 
financial times why he had decided to release rode and other 
imprisoned sikhs 
we have tried everything else he replied

chrysler corps labor problems inflamed by the 
closing of a wisconsin plant and the threatened sale of a parts 
subsidiary are not expected to prevent it and the united auto 
workers from reaching a settlement in contract talks this month 
since chrysler backed down in early march from the planned sale 
of its 28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary caustic 
rhetoric and threats of crippling strikes have been replaced by 
silence as negotiators prepare demands and strategies for the 
opening of talks april 18 
the unions demands will be discussed and approved by the 
140member uaw national chrysler council during a meeting this week 
in kansas city mo 
the talks are likely to be much less dramatic than the unrest 
that led to chryslers agreement to negotiate early since the 
contract must follow an industry pattern contract established last 
fall at ford motor co and used at general motors corp 
the framework should be there and the readiness to bargain 
early should generally be an admission that things will go 
smoothly said harley shaiken labor and technology expert at the 
university of california at san diego 
however shaiken added given all the trauma at chrysler in 
recent years there could be a surprise there is discontent in 
chrysler plants a real unease that could come out in this 
bargaining 
chryslers contract covering 59500 active workers and 8000 on 
layoff expires sept 14 the uaw wanted to adapt the threeyear 
ford and gm contracts to chrysler last fall 
chrysler however didnt agree until it backed off from the 
acustar sale realizing it had opened a wound that would only 
fester if left until the normal midjuly opening of talks 
chryslers workers agreed to concessions in the early 1980s to 
help the company survive its brush with bankruptcy 
many workers say they are disillusioned because a spirit of 
camaraderie of fighting together has disappeared now that 
chrysler is in the black and their contributions arent so keenly 
needed or appreciated 
the average auto worker at chrysler in 197981 had no business 
assuming they were going to have a job there but they made it 
through beautifully the companys done very well to now have to 
start worrying about your job is very nervewracking said 
michael luckey an independent auto industry analyst who has worked 
closely with chrysler 
indeed 5500 uaw members are to lose their jobs this summer 
when chrysler closes a plant at kenosha wis that it acquired 
last year when it bought american motors corp 
the union and state and local officials protested bitterly when 
the plan was revealed saying chrysler had promised to operate the 
plant for up to three years but chrysler insists there was no 
agreement and that the market does not justify keeping the 
86yearold factory open 
chrysler also appears to want to close at least one assembly 
plant not previously announced and possibly more than the six 
announced acustar plants planned for closing the next two ye 
chrysler also will maintain heavy pressure to produce the most 
products with the fewest workers possible said chris cedergren 
industry analyst with jd power and associates in agoura hills 
calif 
while vital to all automakers costcutting is crucial at 
chrysler because its sales depend on keeping its prices lower than 
gm and ford cedergren said 
the pattern contract includes these protections for workers 
a ban on plant closings 
job security provisions that forbid layoffs unless sales of a 
particular product fall and restrict transfer of inside work to 
outside suppliers workers who otherwise would be laid off because 
of subcontracted work or improvements in technology or efficiency 
are put into a job bank where they receive most of their regular 
pay and often retraining 
an agreement for the two sides to study jointly over six months 
ways to improve quality and productivity at each plant preventing 
the company from abruptly forcing drastic workplace changes on 
plants by threatening to close those whose workers refuse 
among potential obstacles to a quick and eventually healing 
settlement is what many view as a loophole in the pattern contract 
although the pattern contract forbids plant closings gm has 
skirted that obstacle by simply laying off all the workers at a 
plant whose product isnt selling well and indefinitely idling the 
factory 
in the chrysler talks uaw negotiators are expected to seek a 
tighter definition of indefinite idling a difficult task and one 
likely to be resisted by chrysler shaiken said 
it would be difficult to renegotiate the ford and gm contracts 
at chrysler he said

president reagan voiced fear 
saturday that the united states could slip to a secondrate world 
power in technology saying scientific research is an 
indispensable investment in americas future 
we can travel as far as the eye of our imagination can see 
reagan said in his weekly radio address to the nation but one 
thing is certain if we dont others will and well fall behind 
this is why ive urged congress to devote more money to 
research reagan said in the speech delivered from his ranch in 
the santa ynez mountains near this seaside resort city 
this year well begin work on the greatgrandchild of those 
particle accelerators that have meant so much to our economic 
growth he said its called the superconducting 
supercollider and it will harness the galloping technology of 
superconductivity so we can explore subatomic particles in ways 
weve never been able to before 
reagan also said that well also continue developing the space 
station when its in orbit the space station will let us perform 
onceimpossible experiments in the weightless environment of outer 
space and understand our world and universe better 
meanwhile back on earth we will be pursuing breakthroughs in 
biotechnology that promise to revolutionize medicine agriculture 
and protection of the environment he said 
but in his talk reagan acknowledged that scientific research is 
expensive 
some say that we cant afford it that were strapped for 
cash he said well leadership means making hard choices even 
in an election year 
without citing dollarsandcents figures reagan said that 
federal spending for scientific research is 58 percent higher than 
a decade ago after discounting for inflation but he indicated 
this is still not enough 
weve put our research budget under a microscope and looked 
for quality and costeffectiveness he said weve put together 
the best program for the taxpayers dollars 
after all the american tradition of hope is one we cant 
afford to forget 
the problem here is that science unlike a bridge or an 
interstate highway or a courthouse has no local constituency he 
said federal funding for science is in jeopardy because of 
budget constraints thats why its my duty as president to draw 
its importance to your attention and that of congress

a 25pound lobster that nearly became 
somebodys easter dinner has been rescued and will be jetting to 
maine on monday to live out its old age beneath the atlantic 
publicity forced a seafood company owner a seafood lover an 
animalrights group and the maine department of marine resources 
into an unlikely alliance to save the creature which was estimated 
to be between 40 and 125 years old 
also saved from the pot was a 19pound companion 
this was something that strikes you in your moral craw said 
gloria felschercohen vice president of the rights group pity not 
cruelty inc 
here is a very old lobster and it just seemed disgusting that 
it should end its life to the cruelest predator man in a pot of 
boiling water 
the 25pounder equipped with claws the size of baseball mitts 
arrived from boston on march 25 after an order got mixed up at 
hills main line seafood co in ardmore 
when owner kevin hill recovered from his astonishment he and 
his staff dubbed her shirley then he sold her and the other hefty 
crustacean to a regular customer a retired carpenter from 
haverford for 287 
but before shirley was out the door the philadelphia inquirer 
ran a story about her and hills phone began ringing with calls 
from lobster advocates including ms felschercohen 
she told him it would be a lovely gesture during the 
passover and easter holidays to celebrate themes of freedom and 
resurrection by buying back the lobsters 
she even offered to top the carpenters price 
after several calls like that hill was convinced when the 
carpenter came to pick up the second lobster hill offered him 387 
for both 
his first feeling was what do you mean theyre going to take 
the lobsters hill said 
i said look theres too many people calling lets free 
the things 
the customer robert miller agreed to exchange the large 
lobsters for 45 pounds of smaller ones rather than for money 
i think its ridiculous miller said whats the 
difference between a onepound lobster and a 25pound lobster 
pity not cruelty meanwhile had already made arrangements with 
the state of maine to turn the creatures loose the group assumed 
the flight costs 
crated and covered with seaweed the lobsters are due to fly to 
portland monday afternoon for a few hours of observation 
if they are healthy we will liberate them the next day 
said lt joseph fessenden of the maine bureau of marine patrol 
they should be freed off the shore of cape elizabeth by the 
portland head light he said 
in maine he added it would be illegal to catch shirley 
because she is much longer than the fiveinch maximum measured

restoration work on rembrandts danae which 
was cut and splashed with acid by an attacker in 1985 has revealed 
how the dutch painter reworked the 17th century masterpiece the 
tass news agency said saturday 
restoration experts in leningrad using xrays ultraviolet and 
infrared light have completed the first stage of their work and 
now are getting ready to retouch the areas where the original paint 
was destroyed the report said 
a case history of hundreds of pages has been recorded tass 
said 
the painting was damaged june 15 1985 by what officials 
described as a madman who threw sulphuric acid on it and 
slashed it twice with a knife at leningrads hermitage museum 
soviet art officials have said the damage was serious but never 
have said specifically how much of the painting was destroyed 
restorers including chemists biologists physicists and other 
scientists began work immediately on the canvas the painting 
depicts the mother of perseus who according to greek legend 
killed medusa and her head of snakes 
soviet art books say rembrandt painted danae in 1636 and 
repainted it in 16461647 
xray studies showed that rembrandt had repainted the gesture 
of the right hand changed the appearance of the old woman looking 
from behind the canopy that he had painted over danaes earrings 
and beads and that he had altered her facial features several 
times in the course of the work tass said 
experts also established that the 81inch canvas was actually 
two pieces that had been skillfully sewn together covered first 
with a brown primer a layer of gray and then whiting 
it is our immutable principle not to paint over even a single 
millimeter of the authors painting yevgeny gerasimov head of 
the restoration effort told tass 
now we are beginning work on those sections where the layer of 
paint had been washed off and advancing from the sides of the 
painting to the four epicenters that suffered most from the acid 
we are drawing copies of danae to master rembrandts style he 
said 
the experts also tried to restore the paintings lacquer which 
had seriously deteriorated in several places tass said 
the report said experts would not speculate on when restoration 
work would be done but that they were confident the painting would 
be displayed once more in the hermitage when the work is completed

gov roy romer shouldnt have to look for a new 
tailor any time soon 
thom payseno offered to make a new overcoat for the governor 
after a denver attorney walked off with romers coat payseno is 
serving a life sentence for murder in state prison 
the original coat was eventually returned but romer said he 
accepted paysenos offer because he believes it is important for 
inmates to be able to display their talents 
romer showed off the new coat at a news conference at the 
capitol on friday the coat is too large because the governor 
furnished his measurements before he lost more than 20 pounds on a 
diet 
rather than make the coat fit by gaining the weight back 
were going to go alter the coat romer said its certainly 
large enough its a nice coat

two sisters both beat out seven other advice columnists by a wide 
margin the harris poll reported saturday 
fiftyone percent of respondents chose for ann when asked which

ann landers leads among all regions and major segments of the 
public but is particularly popular in the midwest among women 
business executives as well as bluecollar and whitecollar 
types wrote pollster louis harris 
dear abby shows strength in the west and among less

we wanted to wed in scotland for a touch of romance but had 
never heard of gretna green until adam suggested it brown said 
it was a neat idea

here is the text of president 
reagans radio address saturday as delivered from his ranch in the 
santa ynez mountains 
my fellow americans passover and easter are festivals of hope 
thats why this weekend is a good time for all of us to reflect on 
the enduring importance to mankind of hope and faith in the future 
and nowhere do our hopes take more visible form than in the quest 
of science 
science has grown and with it the fascination it holds for all 
us but as the pursuit of science has become ever more nationally 
and even multinationally funded it has also become more expensive 
the problem here is that science unlike a bridge or an interstate 
highway or a courthouse has no local constituency 
today when we are witnessing some of the most exciting 
discoveries in the history of science things similar to the 
breakthroughs associated with einstein gallileo and newton 
federal funding for science is in jeopardy because of budget 
constraints 
thats why its my duty as president to draw its importance to 
your attention and that of congress american has long been the 
worlds scientific leader over the years weve secured farm more 
patents than any other country in the world and since world war 
ii we have one more nobel prizes for science than the europeans 
and japanese combined we also support more of what is called 
basic research that is research meant to teach us rather 
than to invent or develop new products and for the past 40 years 
the government has been our leading sponsor of basic research 
the remarkable thing is that although basic research does not 
begin with a particular practical goal when you look at the 
results over the years it ends up being one of the most practical 
things government does for example governmentsponsored basic 
research produced the first laser today less than three decades 
later lasers are used in everything from microsurgery to the 
transmission of immense volumes of information and may contribute 
to our strategic defense initiative that promises to make ballistic 
missiles obsolete 
when i think that over the past 50 years the government has 
helped build a number of particle accelerators so scientists could 
study highenergy physics major industries including television 
communications and computer industries couldnt be where they are 
today without devlopments that began with this basic research 
we cannot know where scientific research will lead the 
consequences and spinoffs are unknown and unknowable until they 
happen in research as albert einstein once said imagination is 
more important than knowledge 
we can travel wherever the eye of our imagination can see but 
one thing is certain if we dont explore others will and well 
fall behind this is why ive urged congress to devote more money 
to research after taking out inflation todays government 
research expenditures are 58 percent greater than the expenditures 
of a decade ago 
it is an indispensable investment in americas future let me 
tell you about just a few of the many projects well fund this 
year this year well begin work on the greatgrandchild of those 
particle accelerators that have meant so much to our economic 
growth its called the superconducting supercollider and it will 
harness the galloping technology of superconductivity so we can 
explore subatomic particles in ways weve never been able to 
before 
well also continue developing the space station when its in 
orbit the space station will let us perform onceimpossible 
experiments in the weightless and sterile environment of outer 
space and understand our world and universe better and were 
developing new technology to allow man eventually to journey beyond 
earths orbit 
astronaut sen jake garn and others in congress have given the 
space program the support it needs to once again reach for the 
stars meanwhile back on earth we will be pursuing breakthroughs 
in biotechnology that promise to revolutionize medicine 
agriculture and protection of the environment 
were working on new ways to spread the seeds of federal 
research working with universities across the country we have 
established 14 engineering research centers devoted to basic 
research on emerging technologies and were planning 10 to 15 new 
science and technology centers to do the same thing in the fields 
of general science 
all of these centers will work with industry so that what they 
discover can quickly lead to new and better and internationally 
competitive products all of this and more is before congress now 
some say that we cant afford it that were too strapped for cash 
well leadership means making hard choices even in an election 
year weve put our research budget under a microscope and looked 
for quality and costeffectiveness weve put together the best 
program for the taxpayers dollars after all the american 
tradition of hope is one we cant afford to forget 
until next week happy easter and passover god bless you

former democratic presidential candidate 
george mcgovern on saturday warned democrats that an attempt to 
deny the partys nomination to the frontrunner at the convention 
could spell defeat in november 
i dont want to see a big divisive fight at the convention 
and a desperate attempt to block the frontrunner because i think 
that would bring a repeat of 1972 mcgovern told the associated 
press 
mcgovern said efforts by some democrats to block his nomination 
despite his delegate lead going into the 1972 democratic convention 
split the party and contributed to his landslide defeat to 
thenpresident nixon in the general election 
it really cost us heavily the fallout was devastating 
mcgovern said 
those lastminute desperation blocking efforts contributed to 
the democratic defeat in the fall he said we should not 
repeat that experience in 1988 
mcgoverns advice to fall in line behind a frontrunner echoes a 
similar call by democratic party chairman paul kirk who also wants 
the nomination settled before the convention 
mcgovern said a brokered convention is unnecessary because the 
voters are the brokers and they are making it clear that michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson are the two candidates who command the 
most support 
after the last primary we should rally around whichever of 
these two frontrunners has the most delegates he said 
if dukakis and jackson end up in a virtual dead heat after 
all the primaries then the convention delegates should decide 
which will be the candidiate mcgovern said 
but if one of the candidates compiles a significant 
firstplace win he is entitled to the nomination mcgovern said 
mcgovern said the democratic race has narrowed to a twoman 
race now between michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
he said neither sen albert gore of tennessee nor sen paul 
simon of illinois is likely to pull ahead but he said he was not 
suggesting they drop out 
thats a judgment they should make but i think that if at the 
end they come up as short as they are now they should get behind 
the frontrunner he said 
mcgovern has not endorsed anyone in the race yet he said 
jackson offers a message of hope and reconciliation and dukakis 
offers a record of experience and competence in government 
democrats should evaluate both progressive spirited men and 
nominate the one with the most delegates he said

senate republicans are complaining that the 
democraticcontrolled judiciary committee hasnt acted quickly 
enough on president reagans federal judge appointees 
there is no reason why we cant with a little extra hard 
work hold hearings when necessary and move some of the nominations 
presently pending out of this committee sen strom thurmond 
rsc said at a recent committee hearing 
but sen patrick leahy dvt who heads the ad hoc subcommittee 
that screens candidates denied there has been any footdragging 
over nominations and leahy told thurmond in a letter your 
concern is misplaced 
leahy also said there is no truth to a rumor circulating on 
capitol hill that the senate would not take up any executive or 
judicial nominations if they were not received by senate majority 
leader robert c byrd dwva by april 1 
i dont know where that rumor came from leahy said in an 
interview sen byrd never told me anything like that sen 
kennedy also told me that he has received no such instructions 
sen edward m kennedy dmass who heads the senate labor and 
human resources committee has been running the judiciary committee 
in the absence of joseph r biden jr ddel who is at home 
recovering from surgery 
linda peek byrds spokeswomen also said that byrd had not made 
a demand on the senates committee chairmen for nominations by 
early april 
thurmond backed by other republicans on the judiciary panel 
complained about what he called the extremely slow pace that the 
committee is processing nominations this year 
in 1986 he said the judiciary committee received 145 
nominations and 139 were confirmed including two supreme court 
justices 11 appeals court judges and 33 district court judges 
that was the last year the republicans controlled the senate 
thurmond said there are currently 36 judicial nominees waiting 
for committee action five of which are for the appeals court and 
21 for the district court 
thurmond said some of the nominees have been waiting for nearly 
a year for senate action 
others have been waiting months specifically he cited the 
nominations of david treen of louisiana which has been pending 
eight months and stuart summitt of new york six months both for 
the appellate court and paul gadola of michigan 11 months 
richard voorhees of north carolina eight months david ezra of 
hawaii four months robert roberto of new york four months 
vaughn walker of california three months and howard levitt of new 
york three months for the district bench 
leahy said thurmond had written to biden three times in march 
complaining about what he described as the extremely slow pace 
that the committee is processing nominations so far this year 
in a reply leahy wrote i believe your concern is misplaced 
he said the committee had received nine nominations to the 
federal courts this year thus far he said his committee had 
already held hearings on 11 nominations with seven more scheduled 
i can offer you my personal assurance that as far as i am 
concerned every single judicial nomination that comes before this 
committee will be considered fairly thoroughly and without any 
unjustified delay leahy wrote i know joe biden shares this 
attitude and i believe the committee has lived up to this standard 
throughout his chairmanship

a study that is looking at ways to help 
students enjoy college has found that the happiest students at 
harvard university are athletes 
the preliminary study also has found that too many students 
dont give enough thought to their major and suggests a need for 
better advising 
the results are too new to have been properly interpreted 
cautions richard f light director of the harvard seminar on 
assessment he suspects athletes are happier because of the social 
life inherent in their activity 
almost by definition anybody in an athletic group has a group 
of people they become very good friends with light said in a 
recent interview 
the seminar is a threeyear 350000 project funded by private 
federal and college funds it involves 90 faculty administrators 
and students from northeastern colleges including amherst 
brandeis pennsylvania princeton smith williams mit and brown 
among the findings halfway through the project a student at 
wellesley college said she chose a joint major in middle east and 
peace studies after a friend suggested it fit her personality said 
wellesley professor david pillemar 
another student chose psychobiology the first week of her 
freshman year because her mother leafing through a course 
catalogue thought it sounded interesting 
a lot of people feel an improvement in the overall college 
experience may not come from teaching the subject a tiny bit better 
but from better advising light said 
the researchers also have found that less than half the female 
freshmen who entered a science program at dartmouth harvard or 
yale graduated in the field but they arent sure yet what that 
means light said 
one interpretation is that is bad were losing talented 
women he said the other is thats great theyre making 
choices 
the researchers will examine 18 separate areas including the 
effects of parttime work and extracurricular activities on 
student success 
and at a time when secretary of education william j bennett has 
accused colleges of ripping off students through poor 
instruction the project will look at different methods of 
instruction ways to improve student writing and student advisory 
programs 
researchers expect to issue a report this summer

independent counsel james mckays criminal 
investigation of attorney general edwin meese iii has run into 
roadblocks because key witnesses have refused to cooperate with the 
probe 
among those who have erected a wall of silence that mckay has 
been unable to penetrate is a central figure in the probe longtime 
meese friend e robert wallach 
the attorney generals former financial manager w franklyn 
chinn who was introduced to meese by wallach also isnt talking 
to mckay chinn and wallach were indicted in december in the 
wedtech scandal one of the areas in which meese has been under 
investigation since last may 11 
former wedtech consultant r kent london another indicted in 
the wedtech scandal also has also refused to talk to mckay 
the latest figure to stand in the way of mckays probe is swiss 
oil man bruce rappaport sources familiar with the probe said he 
decided at the last minute not to give a deposition in london 
where he had agreed to meet with mckays investigators on 
questions of whether meese may have been part of a bribe conspiracy 
in connection with a 1 billion iraqi pipeline project the 
washington post reported that rappaport changed his mind because he 
was afraid he might not remember everything accurately 
federal prosecutors decided to have criminal charges filed 
against wallach chinn and london and decided not to grant them 
immunity from prosecution to compel their testimony 
in december after the three invoked their fifth amendment right 
against self incrimination mckay said he might seek their 
testimony again after their criminal trial on racketeering charges 
in the wedtech scandal 
on friday mckay said there was insufficient evidence to date to 
warrant indicting meese in connection with a 1 billion iraqi 
pipeline plan in which wallach was involved or a possible conflict 
of interest involving meeses telephone company stock a matter in 
which chinn was involved 
meese said he was gratified by the action and the statement 
at a news conference meese referred to the independent 
counsels investigation as an exhaustive process when that 
particular process is completed i think there will be no doubt in 
anybodys mind what the facts are and at that time i will rest on 
that judgment 
when a reporter pointed out that principals in the investigation 
werent talking meese responded im not going to comment on any 
aspect or details of the inquiry thats something that will have 
to be determined by the independent counsel 
sources familiar with mckays probe have said that although the 
special prosecutor has not found sufficient evidence to indict 
meese he could issue a sharply critical report about meeses 
conduct 
the grand jury will continue to examine the pipeline and 
telephone stock matters mostly to tie up loose ends the source 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
if mckay dismisses the grand jury without bringing charges he 
could retain his appointment or seek reappointment if new evidence 
surfaces later the source said 
the grand jury is expected to question meese his wife ursula 
and us circuit judge douglas h ginsburg who was head of the 
justice departments antitrust division during the breakup of the 
american telephone amp telegraph co 
in regard to the pipeline wallach who was rappaports lawyer 
obtained meeses help in arranging a meeting with thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane to help boost the pipeline 
project 
four months later wallach wrote meese a memo that wallach said 
was based on conversations with rappaport it said a portion of up 
to 700 million from the oil pipeline would be funneled to the 
labor party of thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres 
that raised questions of whether meese who has said he doesnt 
recall reading that portion of the memo may have violated the 
foreign corrupt practices act barring bribes to foreign officials 
without being able to question wallach or rappaport mckay is at 
a dead end 
another part of mckays probe the independent counsel says he 
has insufficient evidence on which to seek indictment is meeses 
ownership of 14000 in stock in the regional bell telephone 
companies 
chinn was involved in the baby bell stck ownership at a critical 
juncture 
meese as attorney general met with executives of four of the 
regional bell telephone companies at a time when he owned the stock 
at the time the bell companies were seeking to reverse the 
justice departments position opposing the bells expansion into 
new areas of business meese ended up approving a reversal of the 
departments position early in 1987 
meese says he had intended to sell the stock in 1985 but 
couldnt because he had lost the stock certificates 
complicating mckays investigation was the fact that meese had 
signed a transfer of property agreement with chinn assigning the 
baby bell stock to the financial manager for more than two years 
meese initially listed the stock as having been sold on his 
financial disclosure forms for 1985 and 1986 
meese got replacement certificates late last summer and finally 
sold the stock himself after getting chinn to return it to him 
meese says he considered the transfer agreement a legitimate 
divestiture of the stock but mckays investigators are unable to 
delve into details of the arrangement because they were unable to 
question chinn 
in december mckay said he had insufficient evidence at that 
time to seek an indictment of meese in the wedtech scandal and said 
he might seek testimony from wallach and chinn again after their 
trial 
in the wedtech probe thenwhite house counselor meese 
interceded on the companys behalf at wallachs behest to assist 
the firm in its efforts to obtain a 32 million nobid contract to 
build small engines for the army 
the company got the contract following a crucial white house 
meeting called by meeses deputy three years later meese set up a 
financial partnership after wallach introduced meese to chinn who 
at the time was doing work for wedtech and who later sat on the 
companys board of directors

senate majority leader robert c byrd asked 
americans on saturday to pressure president reagan into signing 
comprehensive trade legislation 
write the president and tell him that this trade bill will 
help you and help america feel proud again byrd dwva urged 
in the democratic partys weekly radio address 
under a compromise worked out by house and senate negotiators 
thursday night the us trade representative would have the 
authority to impose import curbs on the goods of nations who 
violate trade agreements the president could waive the curbs if he 
thought their cost would outweigh the benefit 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater on friday renewed the 
threat of a veto by president reagan saying the bill unreasonably 
ties the presidents hands and that the administration has grave 
reservations about it 
byrd complained that the president has done nothing but cry 
protectionism and wave his veto pen as the ability of the united 
states to compete has eroded 
this is not the time for a veto he said the trade bill 
is a strong comprehensive bill that helps american workers help 
themselves 
he said the democrats goal has been a bill that the president 
will sign adding we have extended our hand in cooperation 
the president may not understand what this bill means to the 
american worker i think you do byrd said in urging his 
listeners to write to the white house 
the measure also would impose import restrictions to punish 
toshiba corp of japan for a subsidiarys role in selling 
computerized submarine propeller milling equipment to the soviet 
union 
and it would require employers to give workers a 60day notice 
of plant closings and large layoffs

here is the text of the democratic partys 
weekly radio address delivered saturday by senate majority leader 
robert c byrd of west virginia 
good afternoon this is sen robert c byrd from west virginia 
the congress is putting the finishing touches on a very important 
trade bill 
it is not a minute too soon our nations trade policy is in 
shambles you know it i know it we import more than we export we 
send more of our money overseas than we get back we are losing 
american jobs we are losing our industrial base we are in hock to 
foreign lenders 
once it wasnt so america traded hard all over the world the 
result was money in the bank and jobs for american workers america 
ran a trade surplus made in the usa was on the product that 
everybody looked for americans took pride in being no 1 
now our ability to compete is eroding for seven years the 
president has refused to act free trade he says what about 
fair trade the president has done nothing but cry protectionism 
and wave his veto pen yet unless we change the way america trades 
the tide of change will sweep our economic destiny out of our hands 
you know what i am talking about you see it in the frustration 
of all the young families who cannot afford to buy their first 
home you understand it when american companies take their jobs 
overseas 
america is rapidly developing a treadmill economy everyone is 
working harder just to keep up yet we still seem to be losing 
ground to our foreign competition our prosperity has always been 
built on working smarter as well as harder yet despite our new 
technology and effort to compete we have been losing the 
productivity race 
for years the reagan administration has left trade policy to the 
whims of the international marketplace and our foreign competition 
the administration has refused to act it has had a donothing 
trade policy 
it is time to get america moving again the stakes are high and 
measured in jobs and in the life style we pass on to our children 
and in our vital national security 
congress will soon send the president a comprehensive trade 
bill we are not ready to say goodbye to the america of our 
dreams what must be done to rebuild americas dreams 
first america must boost its exports selling more goods 
overseas lowers the deficit it is that simple our bill gives the 
president new tools to open new markets for american products 
second we must take steps to promote americas long run 
competitive strengths we want to see more investment in 
individuals and in ideas that means a better educated work force 
stronger laws to protect american inventions from piracy by foreign 
firms 
third we want to give american industry and workers the 
opportunity to retool and retrain quickly i have seen the 
devastating impact in my own state of west virginia where closed 
factories leave workers and whole communities struggling for their 
economic future 
this trade bill sharply improves the opportunities for workers 
to retrain to start new careers if american workers want to move 
to expanding parts of the job market they ought to have that chance 
finally this trade bill would prevent foreign investors from 
dominating industries vital to our national security america 
cannot control its destiny if our foreign competition is buying up 
our assets 
opening new markets for exports giving american industry a leg 
up to retool creating new opportunities for american workers to 
retrain keeping americas destiny in american hands educating our 
children for a prosperous future these are the essentials of this 
trade bill which the president would veto 
in the last few months you have heard a lot of talk about this 
trade bill from the president i am sure you will hear more our 
goal has been a bill that the president will sign we have extended 
our hand in cooperation 
this is not a time for a veto the trade bill is a strong 
comprehensive bill that helps american industry and helps american 
workers help themselves 
the president may not understand what this bill means to the 
american worker to young families who cannot buy their first home 
to the unemployed worker who has lost his job to a foreign 
competitor i think you do 
so write the president tell him of your concerns let him know 
that this trade bill will help america feel proud again lets put 
americas future back in american hands

an iraqi gas attack on a border town and assumed the raid was a 
mistake 
air force maj ahmed sakr salaleh 31 said he was shown an 
iranian documentary of the aftermath of the raid two weeks ago on 
the kurdish town of halabja in northeastern iraq 
all of us suffer seeing these pictures salaleh told 
reporters in tehran i ask god to take all of them to paradise 
salaleh said he was aware that the iraqi air force had been 
dropping chemical weapons but added we are under orders we are 
officers 
he said the chemical bombs were dropped to halt iranian advances 
into iraqi territory iran and iraq have been at war since 
september 1980 
iraq has denied using chemical weapons which are banned by 
international law 
iran has said it captured large tracts of territory in northeast 
iraq in league with kurdish separatists iraq said saturday it 
routed the attackers 
iran says chemical weapons raids on halabja 160 miles northeast 
of baghdad killed 5000 people and wounded another 5000 on march 
1617 
the iraqi pilot said his sovietbuilt sukhoi su22 was shot down 
30 miles south of halabja on march 18 after the gas attacks were 
over 
he said he earlier had released four conventionalexplosive 
1100pound bombs over uninhabited territory when clouds prevented 
bombing of a road 
salaleh said he ejected and parachuted into iranianheld 
territory iran has claimed shooting down more than a dozen iraqi 
warplanes since midmarch 
the iraqi officer said he was not involved in the halabja 
attack he said he was assigned to drop a chemical bomb into 
wetland border territory of iraq in 1983 to prevent an iranian 
offensive there 
the bomb he dropped then was put on his plane by a crew in 
civilian clothes who arrived at the air force base with a truck and 
trailer with civilian plates salaleh said 
he estimated about 50 planes raided halabja from march 1618 
after the iranians and kurdish guerrillas captured the town 
salaleh speaking in relatively good english said he thought the 
chemicalbomb attack was a mistake 
he said one possible explanation was that iraqi intelligence did 
not know the inhabitants were still in the town 
salaleh said he had been well treated since he was captured but 
had not yet been transferred to a prisonerofwar camp 
he said he had heard on iraqi television that iran has used 
artillery gas shells but had no confirmation of this adding that 
iraqi forces had been issued gas masks 
iran has denied using the internationally banned chemical 
weapons but has said it has the capability to produce them 
iraq has repeatedly denied using the weapons while coupling its 
denials with assurances it will use all means at its disposal 
to defend its territory

the sale of federated department stores inc to 
campeau corp is more than just a retailer changing hands analysts 
fear the 658 billion deal may lead to more centralization and 
less innovation in the retail industry 
when ownership of the nations fifthlargest retailer passes to 
campeau the torontobased developer will do what it did when it 
acquired allied stores corp at the end of 1986 pare the company 
down sell its less attractive divisions and keep its most 
profitable stores 
the forecasts are that federated now a collection of diverse 
department and specialty stores will become a centralized retailer 
with few differences among its various units 
the structure will be much more of a chain store company 
said walter loeb a retail industry analyst with the investment 
firm morgan stanley amp co 
robert h morosky the president of allied stores denied 
saturday that campeau would centralize buying operations of 
federated department store divisions that include bloomingdales 
and abraham amp straus in new york lazarus in the midwest and 
burdines in florida 
operations such as distribution will be centralized he said 
but the stores merchandise mix will be determined by the local 
department store divisions 
however loeb predicted that under campeau federated would 
consolidate operations such as purchasing and marketing that are 
now carried out separately by the federated units 
the merchandise will be uniform said loeb who has been 
tracking the industry for almost 40 years its bad for the whole 
industry 
retail industry watchers want to see what loeb called 
innovativeness and testing which helps develop new styles and 
trends when there are more retailers buying and experimenting 
there is a greater opportunity for growth in the retail industry 
fridays announcement of an agreement between federated and 
campeau ended a grueling takeover battle that began jan 25 
federated resisted campeaus overtures for a month agreed to 
negotiate with the canadian company and then in early march 
accepted a buyout offer from rh macy amp co inc 
the wrangling continued for yet another month until macy agreed 
on friday to bow out but the new yorkbased retailer came away 
from the fight with the federated divisions it wanted most 
bullocks stores in california and the southwest and the san 
franciscobased i magnin chain 
many retail industry analysts were rooting for macy to win the 
battle outright they believed macy would have reenergized 
federateds department store divisions in much the way macy has 
revitalized its own image in recent years 
campeau they believed was interested more in federateds real 
estate than its retail operations the stores would give campeau 
chairman robert campeau an instant entree into major shopping malls 
in the united states 
the expected sale of several of federateds divisions represents 
a chance for the retailing industry to move in a new direction but 
whether that happens depends on who buys the stores 
morosky said campeau will retain bloomingdales abraham amp 
straus lazarus and burdines as well as tennesseebased 
goldsmiths and atlantabased richs department stores 
campeau has already agreed to sell federateds texasbased 
foleys and bostonbased filenes department stores to may 
department stores co 
federateds discount and specialty store chains and its 
supermarkets divisions are expected to go on the block however 
morosky said after we comple te our review we might choose to 
keep certain divisions 
campeau wants to sell some of the divisions to pay off debt 
incurred in the federated purchase and to simplify operations 
morosky said 
thomas tashjian an analyst with the los angeles investment firm 
seidler amdec securities inc said recently that if campeau sells 
federateds units to larger companies such as may it would 
continue the trend toward central control and sameness 
however he said if the stores are sold to smaller companies or 
to entrepreneurial management groups it would mean increased 
competition which in turn leads to growth in the retail industry 
the longterm benefit is to the consumer tashjian said 
morosky said campeau already has received inquiries from 
retailers existing management and real estate developers about 
some of the federated stores he said the stores would go on sale 
several days after the purchase of federated is completed

protesters saturday on the eve of us secretary of state george p 
shultzs visit to the middle east it was the highest oneday death 
toll in four months of unrest in the occupied territories

holiday was expected to take its toll on christian easter 
celebrations as well

slain palestinian and flew over the site where chrisitans believe 
jesus was born

killed in the violence in the territories occupied by israel in the 
1967 middle east war

beit liqya and hamis mahmud ahmed 41 from deir al sudan 
the armys version of the clash in gaza conflicted with reports 
from un officials who said the violence began when israelis in 
civilian clothing got out of two cars and tried to arrest a 
palestinian youth 
christine dabagh a un spokeswoman in gaza quoted local 
residents as saying the boys father attacked the israelis with an

on the 10footwide street where el shaer was shot the branch 
of an olive tree had been placed in a puddle of blood it was 
accompanied by a sign which read the heroic martyr salim

east swing strongly opposed by palestinian underground leaders who 
have accused the secretary of trying to crush their uprising 
in the latest underground leaflet released thursday leaders 
called for a threeday general strike monday through wednesday to

americas biotechnology industry hailed 
saturday by president reagan for its promise to revolutionize 
medicine agriculture and protection of the environment is 
seriously hampered by government delays on patent applications 
congressional and industry officials say 
reagan in a radio address from his california ranch called for 
renewed us determination to remain the worlds scientific leader 
noting that over the years weve secured far more patents than 
any other country he cited biotechnology as one of the most 
fertile fields for exploration 
for hundreds of small biotech companies developing new drugs 
plants and other products through molecular biology the issuance 
of a patent can mean instant success but the wait can take more 
than four years leaving some firms to ponder the risk of marketing 
their products without patent protection 
in some of the biotech examining units at the us office of 
patents and trademarks it takes an average of 27 months just to 
open an application file and another 25 months to award or deny a 
patent complained rep ron wyden dore whose house small 
business subcommittee is looking into the problem 
biotech products have begun to pour out of the laboratories of 
the 12yearold industry doubling the backlog of patent 
applications from 3903 in 1985 to 7821 by august of last year by 
some estimates 11000 applications are now pending 
according to industry forecasts biotech sales in us markets 
will total 650 million this year barring further bureaucratic 
snags the industry projects domestic sales of 34 billion by 1993 
and 132 billion by 1998 international sales could triple the 
domestic figure officials say 
but the longer it takes of patents to be issued the longer we 
work in a black hole says hubert jp schoemaker chairman of 
centocor inc 
that complaint is echoed by officials of genentech which has 
begun marketing a muchacclaimed drug known as tpa a clot buster 
for heart attack victims genentechs patent application is still 
pending however and several other companies are planning to 
market their own tpa drugs 
turnover among biotech patent examiners lured to private 
companies by higher pay has been part of the problem wyden said 
the turnover was 50 percent last year though the patent office has 
created 10 new biotech positions for a total of 42 and recently 
consolidated all those positions within a special biotech unit 
patent commissioner donald j quigg said meanwhile that the 
office is seeking approval from the office of personnel management 
to create special pay rates for the examiners who usually have a 
doctorate or masters degree in molecular biology or biochemistry 
quigg said the goal of the patent office is to process all 
applications within 18 months but that target likely wont be met 
until 1993 or 1994 
to encourage inventions the constitution gives inventors the 
right to a shortterm exclusive monopoly on products that result 
from their new ideas currently the monopoly lasts 17 years 
to make sure the invention is indeed new and not an obvious 
twist to existing technology the patent office examines 
applications in light of previous patents 
lack of patents leads firms to hold their products off the 
market or to risk theft of their invention if they sell without 
full protection since the united states does not publish 
applications after 18 months as all other major countries do the 
backlog may lead several companies to undertake duplicate research 
they would not perform if they knew someone else was likely to win 
a patent 
increasing backlogs in the processing of patent applications 
will have serious deleterious effects on continuing investment and 
the maintenance of the united states leadership position said 
george b rathmann president of amgen inc of thousand oaks 
calif in testimony to wydens subcommittee 
linda i miller a vice president of painewebber inc a wall 
street investment firm found in a survey of four dozen 
prospectuses by biotechnology companies that nearly all mentioned 
uncertainty about patent protection as a potential risk for 
investors 
she gave the subcommittee charts of price movements of several 
stocks up when specific patents were awarded and down when patent 
disputes broke out between two companies 
the applications backlog appears to be growing at 20 percent a 
year she reported 
with the lack of clarity of property rights in biotechnology 
in the united states many companies are developing similar 
products expending valuable resources both human and financial 
on metoo programs she said

eight months after they landed to 
enforce a peace accord between rival ethnic groups indian soldiers 
are chasing a faceless enemy 
the tamil rebels who have waged a fouryear war of guerrilla 
fighting and terrorism against sri lankas sinhalese majority seem 
to be everywhere and nowhere at once 
every young man is a potential foe whether dressed in trousers 
or the plaid sarongs favored in the steamy heat of this tropical 
island 18 miles off indias southern coast 
every few miles along potholed roads indian soldiers man 
sandbagged checkpoints where they halt travelers who come on foot 
on bicycles and jammed into minibuses 
despite an indian force estimated at 50000 by the indians and 
as high as 100000 by sri lankan officials a ragtag band of tamil 
tiger rebels continues to kill and maim indian soldiers massacre 
sinhalese villagers and extort money from tamils sinhalese and 
moslems alike 
the indians say there are about 2500 hardcore fighters in the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest rebel group the 
tigers claim there are only 175 
more than 8000 sri lankans mostly sinhalese have been killed 
since 1984 india has lost at least 400 soldiers since oct 10 
1987 when it launched an offensive to disarm the tigers 
the indians sent troops to control the rebels as part of a peace 
plan they sponsored in july 1987 the agreement granted some 
autonomy to tamils but it was rejected by extremists on both sides 
of the conflict 
india sri lankas northern neighbor has a large tamil minority 
of its own 
despite indias firepower armor lumbering troop trucks 
darting jeep patrols and helicopters and allied government forces 
the tigers slip from village to village and even into big towns 
like batticaloa 
in arapattai 5 miles south of batticaloa on sri lankas eastern 
coast indian soldiers recently checked pedestrians identity cards 
and munched snacks purchased in local shops 
a fiveminute walk away a man sought by the indians for 
harboring tiger fighters said the rebels could not be vanquished 
our fight is reasonable we must win he said switching on an 
electric fan as an elderly relative tended his infant twins 
the man asked not to be identified although the indians know 
his name and where he lives they also know that the minute they 
come after him his neighbors will sound an alarm and he will slip 
away as he has done several times before through the fences of 
woven palm fronds that make arapattai look like an impenetrable 
maze 
the tigers are fighting for an autonomous region in northern and 
eastern sri lanka although tamils make up only 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people they are a majority in northern and 
eastern provinces 
in eastern provinces batticaloa district the population of 
about 365000 is 72 percent tamil sinhalese account for only 3 
percent there while moslems comprise 25 percent 
the tamils say they have been discriminated against in 
education jobs and by a 1956 law that made sinhalese the official 
language of sri lanka tamils are mainly hindu and the sinhalese 
are buddhists 
batticaloa population 46000 is a town of poor fishermen 
small shops and many churches monuments to the missionary efforts 
of the dutch portuguese and british colonial eras 
the indian presence keeps armed tigers out of clear sight but 
according to residents who feared for their safety if their names 
were published the tigers make themselves felt in other ways 
they send notes asking for money people who refuse are 
killed a middleaged tamil said they have people in the 
banks so they know how much money we have 
but that tamil like others who described the tigers 
fundraising tactics defended the rebels cause as a just fight 
for tamil rights 
just because theyre militant theyre not unreasonable 
said one tamil bureaucrat 
a occasional land mine or hand grenade explodes in batticaloa 
near a group of the indian soldiers or the predominantly sinhalese 
sri lankan police force 
sometimes the indian response is disciplined other times it 
verges on panic batticaloa residents said 
on march 26 a grenade was thrown at the sri lankan police 
headquarters no one was hurt by the grenade but it prompted three 
hours of gunfire that injured a halfdozen people including two 
schoolchildren 
sri lankan police officers declined to say whether their men 
fired but batticaloa residents said the police apparently started 
the shooting and the indians followed with automatic rifle fire 
the roads were packed with children said the rev harry 
miller a jesuit from new orleans who has spent the past 40 years 
at st michaels school the schoolchildren just panicked they 
dropped their books and bicycles and ran 
an indian major speaking on condition of anonymity admitted 
that mistakes have been made there is no doubt there is some 
confusion he said

the disturbances in soviet armenia may have 
been instigated by a local leader who was a target of mikhail s 
gorbachevs anticorruption campaign according to analysts 
the local leader may have capitalized on unrest exacerbated by 
gorbachevs drive for economic reform known as perestroika 
and his allowance of greater public debate of some topics known as 
glasnost according to a government analyst 
similar disturbances have been reported in each of the 15 
republics in the soviet union and in many instances the 
demonstrations grew out of russian resentment of kremlin efforts to 
help nonrussians by giving them jobs and raising their living 
standards scholar paul goble of washington said in an article last 
year 
many russians came to the conclusion that what had appeared to 
be reasonable affirmative action for the nonrussians was in fact 
unreasonable reverse discrimination against themselves goble 
wrote 
that system worked under the late soviet leader leonid brezhnev 
who tolerated corruption and widespread inefficiency in the 
economy under his leadership a russian and a nonrussian were 
frequently allowed to hold redundant jobs 
but gorbachev in his effort to streamline the economy has 
stepped on a lot of ethnic toes 
it is not that he is coming down hard on any ethnic group it 
is that he is trying to make the economy more efficient said 
nancy lubin a georgetown university professor 
ostensibly the demonstrations in armenia a largely christian 
republic stemmed from armenian desire to administer the largely 
armenian region of nagornokarabakh which is in neighboring 
azerbaijan a predominately moslem republic 
but the unrest began after party newspapers criticized the 
armenian party leader karen demirchyan said an administration 
source who like other government analysts interviewed spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
demirchyan 55 named to his post in 1974 was attacked last 
june by gorbachev who said that reforms were stuck in a rut in 
armenia and that demirchyan and his underlings showed totally 
unjustified complacency toward corruption 
reformers in the armenia communist party attempted to oust 
demirchyan during a meeting of the party central committee last 
december but were thwarted according to elizabeth fuller a 
sovietwatcher based in munich 
the authoritative communist party daily pravda hinted strongly 
of a purge in armenia 
the absolute majority of armenian working people are honest 
persons who conscientiously attend their duty and it is not their 
fault that the process of democratization and renewal is meeting 
with fierce resistance of perestroika pravda said in december 
people yearn for genuine changes 
the demonstrations in armenia began two months later with 
either the complicity or encouragement of demirchyan said a 
government analyst we believe he backed them or encouraged 
them to warn moscow that getting rid of him could cause trouble 
demirchyan has survived the upheaval although some party 
leaders in azerbaijan and nagornokarabakh have been removed 
gorbachevs efficiency drive has cost local jobs in kazakhstan 
the scene of riots in december 1986 gorbachev abolished the 
kazakhstan ministry of nonferrous metallurgy transferring its 
functions to a parallel ministry in moscow but throwing a lot of 
educated kazakhs out of work said a government analyst 
similarly gorbachevs highly celebrated campaign against 
alcohol has cost jobs in the vineyards of armenia creating tension 
there said the analyst 
the ethnic unrest has prompted gorbachev to announce that he 
will convene the policymaking communist party central committee to 
discuss the issue at an as yet unannounced date 
gorbachev probably will continue to crack down as he did in 
armenia and neighboring azerbaijan to show people that they 
cant get what they want by going to the streets an analyst said

an estonian nationalist his family and 
the wife of another nationalist were kicked out of the soviet union 
on saturday according to a spokesman for a stockholmbased 
estonian nationalist organization 
mart kikerpuu spokesman for hjalpcentralen an organization 
which specializes in helping political refugees from the soviet 
republic said one of the expelled jaan nomm held a nationalistic 
speech in tallinn last feb 24 on the 70th anniversary of 
estonias presoviet independence 
the organization said this was why he was forced to leave

a diesel oil spill floated along about 50 
miles of the ohio river on saturday and the coast guard and state 
officials were searching for the source of the fuel 
we want to make sure its not still flowing into the river 
said lt eric mosher were looking for the source and have teams 
from louisville and cincinnati making bank searches 
the oil extended from the area of madison in southeastern 
indiana to louisville 
indiana conservation authorities also helped in the search 
mosher added barge fleets towboats and holding tanks along the 
river were all being checked 
mosher said the water was too choppy for an attempt to contain 
the oil slick 
the spill apparently caused no serious problem for communities 
that use the river as a source of drinking water and mosher said 
none of them had closed water intake valves 
were treating the river water for some of the byproducts of 
oil but the river is relatively warm and it doesnt look like its 
emulsifying and it looks like it will float past said jerry 
ford manager of administrative services for the louisville water 
co 
shutting down intake valves is always an alternative to 
treating but when you have oil byproducts that will float on top 
of the water normally you dont have that much effect ford 
said he noted that the intake valves are on the river bottom 
indiana state police sgt james hickerson said the slick was not 
thick and heavy all the way but there were traces for the entire 
distance 
patrolman tim armstrong in madison ind said his department 
began getting reports of a strong diesel smell from the river about 
730 pm friday and the spill was discovered after sunup saturday 
morning 
officials were unable to say what effect the spill might have on 
the environment 
it depends on the oils consistency as to whether or not it 
will threaten wildlife ford said 
weve had no fish kill and havent observed loss of any marine 
life said sgt carroll henneke of the indiana department of 
natural resources we dont anticipate any simply because this 
appears to be floating if it doesnt settle in we dont expect to 
lose any of our fishery

riot police fought hundreds of 
firebombthrowing radical students saturday after the police used 
tear gas to keep the students from marching off a campus 
riot police fired multiple tear gas launchers at about 500 
students from a dozen seoul universities when they tried to march 
out of yonsei university after a prolabor rally students 
immediately streamed out of the campus and battled riot police for 
several hours 
no serious injuries or arrests were reported 
during the rally student leaders denounced the government of 
president roh taewoo as just another authoritarian regime they 
had gathered to show support for workers who want higher wages and 
more independent unions 
labor disputes have increased sharply since roh took office feb 
25 as have protests by antigovernment students 
since his election in december roh has promised to better the 
lot of workers but his government has also vowed to deal harshly 
with violent protests to ensure the countrys stability and steady 
economic development 
violent labor protests battered many south korean companies last 
summer following widespread protests that led former president chun 
doohwan to agree to democratic reforms 
those reforms included the direct elections in which roh was 
chosen without having won a majority when two rival opposition 
candidates split the antigovernment vote

members of a satanic cult have been 
frightened by the paranoia aroused by rumors that the cult was 
planning a human sacrifice authorities say 
theyre keeping kind of low magnolia police chief smithie 
buie said of the cult members friday 
terrified parents kept hundreds of students out of schools in 
the nearby southern mississippi town of mccomb thursday as a 
precaution against a rumored list of potential student victims 
but an unidentified source within the group informed police that 
they didnt want to hurt or frighten anyone buie said 
police in pike county reported a quiet evening thursday the 
night according to rumors that satanists were to march down a 
mccomb street before sacrificing a young virgin 
we didnt receive a single report thursday night pike 
county sheriff robert lawson said friday 
buie said the cult has existed since at least the 1960s and 
although its members occasionally sacrifice animals including cats 
and dogs they havent been known to harm people 
the midnight meetings are attended by between five and 20 
couples mostly between 17 and 23 years old and are followed by 
group sex buie said the source reported new members traditionally 
are recruited by word of mouth and are required to sacrifice an 
animal he said 
i think theyre mainly in it for the orgies buie said 
participants may be guilty of cruelty to animals and 
trespassing buie said but they change their ritual sites and 
police never know where they will meet 
actually as long as they are peaceful wed probably never 
know what was happening the police chief said also theres a 
question of a man having a right to his own worship

czechoslovak cardinal frantisek tomasek 
said in an interview published saturday that the czechoslovak 
government lost credibility when it broke up a peaceful 
demonstration for religious freedom last week 
the roman catholic cardinal was quoted in the austrian daily 
kurier as saying that the demonstration in bratislava march 25 
was a step towards more religious freedom and the government must 
take this into account 
eyewitnesses estimated about 2000 roman catholics took part in 
the protest on bratislavas downtown hviezdoslav square officials 
said 125 people were arrested and later released riot police and 
water cannons broke up the demonstration which had been banned in 
advance 
the czechoslovak government through this measure lost even 
more credibility tomasek was quoted as saying in early sunday 
editions 
tomasek 88 said the roman catholic church is 99 percent 
laymen it is the duty of the laymen to demonstrate for their 
rights he was quoted as saying 
the slovak communist party daily pravda charged saturday that 
the organizers of the demonstration were interested in the church 
and religious freedom only as long as they can misuse them 
politically against the socialist state 
according to the czechoslovak state news agency ctk which 
carried parts of the editorial pravda said religious activists 
intended to harm talks between the czechoslovak leadership and the 
vatican on filling 10 vacant bishoprics 
tomasek complained in the kurier interview that the czechoslovak 
delegation which is to travel to the vatican for the next round of 
negotiations later this month was negotiating in rome about us 
but without us the paper said czechoslovak authorities had not 
allowed him to take part 
austrian cardinal franz koenig in a seperate interview with 
kurier praised the strength of religious belief in the east bloc 
what the believers in these countries want and the pope 
supports them in this is not an upset of the political relations 
but the possibility as christians to live their beliefs in a state 
system which is officially based on atheism koenig was quoted as 
saying 
the former archbishop of vienna said he thought pope john paul 
iis visit to austria in june would be a bridge between east and 
west in europe 
what the pope says in austria will also be heard in 
yugoslavia in czechoslovakia and beyond and will be followed with 
interest koenig was quoted as saying in the kurier interview 
thousands of hungarian and slovene catholics are expected to 
come to austria to see the pope

the military rushed extra troops to 
the presidential palace saturday and launched a nationwide hunt for 
the leader of an august coup attempt after he escaped from prison 
military leaders warned that former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan who escaped with 14 prison guards and who remains a 
popular figure in the armed forces might try to topple the 
government again 
if he pursues his attempts to change the government and lead 
the afp armed forces of the philippines then we will have a 
problem military spokesman col oscar florendo said saturday 
we are asking the support of the citizens to help us we 
anticipate they the rebels will go on with consolidation and 
propaganda and they will again try to divide the afp 
honasan 39 escaped from a prison ship before dawn saturday 
with 14 elite navy personnel who were supposed to be guarding him 
he had been confined there since his arrest dec 9 for the aug 28 
attempted coup which left at least 53 people dead and hundreds 
wounded 
his daring escape was a blow to the prestige of the armed 
forces already facing threats from communist and moslem rebels 
president corazon aquino hurried back to manila saturday after 
the escape interrupting an easter holiday in northern luzon for 
emergency meetings and a nationally televised address 
i have instructed the chief of staff to issue a warning in 
unmistakable terms to all military personnel that any assistance 
given to the renegades will be dealt with promptly and severely 
with the full force of the law she said in the address 
mrs aquino who had refused to grant amnesty to honasan 
appealed to the public for help in tracking him down she said he 
fled to avoid courtmartial for mutiny and sedition arson murder 
and conduct unbecoming an officer his escape she added is 
tantamount to an admission of his guilt 
justice secretary sedfrey ordonez hinted the government would 
shut down news organizations if it felt their reports in any way 
helped the rebels cause honasan had given several interviews to 
local and foreign media before his arrest in a manila suburb 
florendo said honasan fled from the andres bonifacio prison 
vessel with a navy lieutenant and 13 enlisted men the ship was 
anchored in manila bay about 500 yards from navy headquarters 
they escaped in dinghies that had been sent to the ship to 
increase security after reports that honasan would try to escape 
florendo said loyal guards fired on the fleeing boats but 
apparently missed 
mrs aquino said the prison ships captain had been arrested and 
he and members of his crew would face courtmartial for negligence 
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
former colonel was so popular that he had become the dominant 
figure aboard the vessel which was supposed to be his prison he 
remains widely respected in the 160000member armed forces even 
though he has officially been dismissed from the military 
meanwhile the government rushed to strengthen security in and 
around the capital saturday trucks and bulldozers blocked 
entrances to military camps in manila and mobile checkpoints were 
set up on roads leading north 
defense secretary fidel v ramos said the military was taking 
every possible action to bring him honasan back and to minimize 
or neutralize any further demage that he can make 
despite the crisis presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said 
mrs aquino would go ahead with a visit to china scheduled to 
begin april 14 
honasan a former defense ministry chief of security played a 
key role in the feb 22 1986 civilianmilitary uprising that 
toppled president ferdinand marcos and brought mrs aquino to 
power but he later accused mrs aquino of weak and inept 
leadership in the face of the communist insurgency 
in august honasan led 2000 men in a coup on the presidential 
palace and seized several media and military installations in the 
capital but they were driven off by proaquino forces 
it was the most serious of six major plots to unseat mrs 
aquino honasan escaped and went into hiding before his arrest four 
months later the military says 11 officers and 90 enlisted men 
involved in the coup attempt remain at large 
mrs aquino said saturday that honasan had carried out his coup 
attempt while facing investigation into misappropriation of 
military equipment she also said he wanted to avoid a combat 
command

an ethiopian rebel group claimed saturday 
that it controls the main route for transporting food for millions 
of ethiopians facing starvation 
assefa mamoa spokesman for the tigre peoples liberation front 
said the road between the northernmost provinces of tigre and 
eritrea is only open for humanitarian assistance 
we are calling upon the humanitarian organizations to go on 
with their operations and the tplf will guarantee their security 
he said in a telephone call from washington to the associated press 
bureau in nairobi 
mamoa said the front took control of the road thursday the 
rebels claims could not be verified but the sovietbacked marxist 
government in the ethiopian capital addis ababa has acknowledged 
the rebels made some advances amid heavy fighting 
tigre and eritrea are the worsthit areas in a drought that has 
threatened about 7 million ethiopians with starvation fighting in 
both regions has disrupted emergency relief efforts 
because of rebel activities the government often closes roads 
in the regions cutting off truck convoys carrying food most of 
the food reaching tigre comes in by road after being unloaded at 
the eritrean port of massawa on the red sea 
david morton director of ethiopian operations for the world 
food program said a un convoy used the road monday to deliver 
food to the town of wukro and returned along the same road tuesday 
he said both trips were without incident 
mamoa also claimed that government troops on thursday abandoned 
the northern tigre town of adigrat the front previously announced 
the capture thursday of the towns of axum and adowa 
the only remaining major areas held by the ethiopian 
government are the provincial capital makelle and maichew 
mamoa said the situation of the ethiopian military forces is 
collapsing 
ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam said in a radio 
broadcast thursday that his troops were fighting grim battles 
against secessionist rebels in tigre and eritrea it was a rare 
acknowledgement 
mengistu inherited the insurgencies 13 years ago when he and a 
group of fellow army officers dethroned emperor haile selassie and 
set up a marxist government 
eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in africas 
oldest civil war the civil war in tigre is in its 14th year

democratic presidential hopeful michael 
dukakis on saturday blamed arab leaders for the failure of middle 
east peace initiatives and said he disagreed strongly with jesse 
jackson on policies in the region 
positioning himself for the crucial new york primary in two 
weeks the massachusetts governor said that the question of a 
palestinian homeland should be resolved in the direct negotiations 
between israel and its neighbors 
we will reach out to those on all sides in all countries who 
believe in a future of peace and security dukakis said in a 
major foreign policy speech before about 600 people at the 
university of wisconsin at oshkosh negotiations with the 
palestinian people are possible negotiations with terrorists are 
not 
dukakis has been reluctant to point out where he disagrees with 
rival jesse jackson on the issues but he did so when asked about 
jacksons embrace of plo leader yasser arafat and whether the plo 
and israel are morally equivalent 
i dont agree with him dukakis said 
that relatively mild statement contrasted sharply with sen 
albert gore jrs denunciation of jacksons foreign policy ideas in 
the same area earlier this week 
with the speech and a later news conference dukakis was trying 
to make certain that rival presidential hopeful gore does not 
appear more committed to israel than he does a key issue with 
jewish voters who may make up a quarter of the new york electorate 
aides denied the speech was designed to respond to gore but 
admitted it should blunt the controversy about gores comments 
on another matter dukakis said the united states has the full 
right to defend the panama canal and that he does not oppose 
president reagans dispatch of more troops there in light of the 
unrest in panama 
first on saturday dukakis turned his attention to bluecollar 
voters in the wisconsin primary on tuesday at a labor roundtable 
in kenosha his approach was a combination of competence and 
earthiness 
my friends this is not a lot of talk i know how to do 
things the massachusetts governor told the crowd after seven 
years of charisma maybe it is time we had a little competence in 
the white house 
twice in his speech dukakis used an expletive an unusual 
action for a politican with a repuation as a controlled technocrat 
hell im the only candidate in this race who has ever 
balanced a budget he said at one point 
then boasting about the benefits of full employment dukakis 
added hell they are paying six bucks an hour in mcdonalds in my 
state because they cant get people its a wonderful wonderful 
thing thats the kind of future i want to build for this country 
in his foreign policy speech dukakis touched on a range of 
issues but the biggest chunk dealt with the middle east 
dukakis called for a continuation of the camp david peace 
process which he said was the unfulfilled vision of the late 
egyptian president anwar sadat and former israeli prime minister 
menachem begin 
why because few arab leaders have had the courage to see the 
middle east as sadat saw it few arab leaders have had the wisdom 
to choose reconciliation over conflict to choose hope instead of 
hate to prepare for the future rather than relive the wars of the 
past he said 
dukakis made abundantly clear his commitment to israel 
the first thing anyone must understand about the middle east 
is that we will never let israel down he said for decades 
america leaders have know and the american people have understood 
that israels fate is our fate that our security interests are 
linked and that our historical and cultural bonds cannot and will 
not broken 
israel like the united states is a special place 
after support for israel dukakis laid down three other tenets 
of his middle east policy 
the second was the necessity for direct negotiations between 
israel and its neighbors 
third was a continuation of the camp david understandings on the 
future of the west bank and the gaza strip 
that framework recognizes the right of the people of the 
territories to shape their own destiny in a way that is consistent 
with israels right to exist within safe and security and 
recognized borders he said 
and fourth dukakis condemned the soviet union and china for 
continuing a major flow of arms into the middle east particularly 
chinas sale of mediumrange missiles to saudi arabia 
dukakis did not mention his dispute with gore over a letter 30 
us senators signed on march 3 encouraging secretary of state 
george shultz to pursue his peace plan and criticizing israeli 
leaders for not cooperating with the effort 
on central america dukakis praised the progress toward peace in 
the region castigating the reagan administration for being unable 
to cope with the threat of peace there 
dukakis also brought up us policy toward south africa where he 
declared the president must say no to apartheid no to 
racism no to doing business with south africa

ultraleftist gang of four have loosened state controls over 
business and opened the nation to foreign influences 
but they also have prompted the corrupt and ugly phenomenon 
of nouveau riche upstarts who use money to seduce or philander 
with women and even take concubines zheng said 
in addition bribery embezzlement and speculation have become 
commonplace he said 
from august 1983 to the end of 1987 the nations courts passed 
judgment on 2 million people for whitecollar crime about 38 
percent or 760000 received sentences of at least five years in 
jail he said 
last year the number of criminals given sentences of 10 years or 
more for such crimes more than doubled zheng said although he did 
not provide figures 
zheng said that of the offenders since 1983 government 
employees made up 15 percent while 28 percent were factory workers 
zheng did not say how many people were sentenced to die 
foreign analysts have estimated that more than 10000 people 
have been executed since 1983 but china has never released figures 
on capital punishment it is unclear how many people were executed 
for whitecollar crime 
zheng said the growth of nongovernmental loans many without 
written contracts and with high interest rates has led to a sharp 
jump in debt cases last year there were 256000 cases eight 
times the 1983 figure 
divorce cases are also up he said partly because women have 
become more economically independent under the governments reform 
policies 
some women with greater economic means cannot bear the bond of 
arranged marriage or maltreatment by their husband thus demanding 
divorces their demand is progressive and the peoples courts give 
them full support according to law he said 
in a separate speech yang yichen head of the supreme peoples 
procuratorate or prosecutors office said 1500 leading officials 
had been prosecuted over the past five years for such crimes as tax 
evasion trademark counterfeits and manufacturing fake and faulty 
commodities 
zheng said the courts continued to deal with cases of people 
wronged during the leftist anarchy of the 196676 cultural 
revolution he said courts had taken up 789000 related criminal 
cases and new verdicts were given in 286000 cases

the 500foot highway of steel over the 
little missouri river is more than just a bridge to this small 
village on the fort berthold indian reservation 
this one possesses personality they say so much so they refer 
to it by name lost bridge 
the 20footwide threespan truss bridge was erected in 1929 
when it only connected two dusty cattle trails said bill jennings 
assistant bridge engineer for the state highway department 
they built a bridge that had no access to it said lisa 
redford a spokesman for mandaree inc 
now that state highway 22 crosses the bridge the state wants to 
build a replacement and mandaree inc hopes to preserve the old 
span as a focus for development 
people old enough to remember its origin are still baffled i 
dont even know why they built it fred lone fight said 
nobody used lost bridge before garrison dam was built downstream 
in the 1950s and lake sakakawea blocked many roads pamela black 
hawk recalled 
eventually highway 22 became a paved ribbon of asphalt and the 
bridge part of the shortest western route around the lake got far 
more use the state wants to replace it with a modern bridge thats 
16 feet wider and can carry heavier loads jennings said 
so the state is searching for a buyer for the steel structure 
and is offering 50000 to aid in moving it if no one takes the 
bridge it will be torn down 
mandaree inc is exploring the possibility of essentially 
adopting the bridge the group envisions using it for a fishing 
site the focal point of a place for prairieweary travelers to 
stop for rest or a picnic said redford 
that would preserve lost bridge for its historic and sentimental 
importance she said 
the bridge sits 10 miles south of mandaree in a picturesque 
valley of rolling river bluffs that are void of any manmade 
structures except for the highway itself and an occasional highway 
sign 
driving into the valley the sundrenched metal bridge glistens 
as it stands against a backdrop of prairie grass 
any group that agrees to preserve the bridge gets at least 
50000 the estimated expense for tearing it down from the 
state jennings said 
the deadline for assuming ownership of bridge is november he 
said mandaree inc hopes to make a decision within the next few 
weeks redford said 
we are looking right now into the liabilities and what the 
federal guidelines call for in maintaining a historic bridge 
said redford 
the history is what makes it unique jennings said the 
fact they call it a lost bridge 
a new bridge just west of lost bridge will cost an estimated 1 
million he said the state hopes to begin construction in 1990 
in the early 1970s the state tried to give away a rainbowarch 
bridge over the cannonball river but found no takers jennings 
recalled 
they took a lot of pictures wrote up quite a documentary on 
it and destroyed the bridge he said

chinas legislature blew a small breath of 
democracy into the government on saturday by approving a bill that 
for the first time allows candidates to compete for seats on its 
standing committee 
from now on the 2794 delegates to the national peoples 
congress will elect its 155member standing committee 
as before 20 candidates including the chairman and vice 
chairmen will be chosen by the congress ruling presidium and 
elected without opposition but now 144 candidates will compete for 
the other 135 seats 
deputies can vote against a candidate or abstain but the 20 
without opposition can be defeated only if they get fewer than half 
of votes cast 
only two delegates opposed and one abstained in the vote to 
approve the procedure 
the congress ruled out more than one candidate for such posts as 
president and vice president congress chairman chairman of the 
central military commission and president of the supreme peoples 
court 
it said the presidium will fill those key posts in line with 
the opinions of the majority of deputies 
the presidium will also elect the premier vice premiers 
ministers state councilors and other government officers with a 
single candidate for each post submitted by the president 
acting premier li peng is certain to be formally named head of 
government 
china says the current session of the congress has been the most 
open and democratic ever official newspapers and national 
television have spotlighted debate among the delegates and speeches 
voicing opposition to various policies 
still the communist party and its governing politburo remain in 
firm control over decisions of policy and personnel the congress 
main function is still to rubberstamp moves by the party

iraq said saturday its forces killed 
thousands of iranian troops and overran bases of iranianbacked 
kurdish rebels in mountainous northeastern iraq 
iranian warplanes bombed an iraqi garrison in the region tehran 
radio reported but irans news media had no immediate comment on 
the iraqi victory claim 
irans islamic republic news agency reported that iraqi forces 
were leveling the kurdish town of seyyed sadiq in sulaymaniyah 
province and its inhabitants were seeking refuge in nearby towns 
kurdish separatist leader jalal talabani confirmed there was 
heavy fighting and said iraq was waging a genocide campaign 
against our people through the daily use of poison gas 
a tenuous halt in the war of the cities held as iraq 
continued to silence its longrange missile launchers for the 
duration of a trip to baghdad by turkish prime minister turgut 
ozal iran did not report any attacks on civilian targets either 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz reaffirmed his nations 
readiness to continue the halt even after ozal returns to turkey 
probably sunday evening the iraqi news agency reported 
but it quoted him as saying the truce would continue only if 
iran accepted several iraqi demands including an iranian 
withdrawal from iraqi territory that iran has repeatedly scoffed 
at 
kuwaits ruler issued a new appeal to iran to end the war with 
iraq through negotiations 
baghdad radio quoted a high command communique as saying iraqi 
troops completely purged the area around qara dagh in the 
sulaymaniyah region of iraq in the last two weeks 
qala dagh is only 20 miles west of lake darbandikhan where 
iranian revolutionary guards have thrust into iraq in a 16dayold 
offensive 
the iraqi news agency quoted its correspondent as saying 
thousands of iranians were killed he did not give figures for 
casualties among the kurdish guerrillas 
the correspondent also specifically denied a report carried 
friday by the associated press that kurdish rebels were within 
five miles of a major highway linking sulaymaniyah with other iraqi 
cities 
the communique quoted by baghdad radio said all traitors have 
finally been destroyed in a reference to the iranianbacked 
kurdish rebels who have been fighting baghdad for an independent 
homeland for years 
it said an iraqi force including kurdish fighters loyal to 
baghdad had overrun 21 kurdish bases and villages used by the 
guerrillas in the last few days 
tehran radio said iranian warplanes bombed an iraqi garrison at 
shanandari in the heart of the area of hostilities inflicting 
heavy losses and damage 
talabani leader of one of the two main kurdish rebel groups 
the patriotic union of kurdistan said an iraqi chemical attack on 
the village of seoosaru earlier last week killed 60 kurdish 
villagers and wounded 211 
they are now resorting to a scorchedearth policy killing 
defenseless women and children indiscriminately and destroying 
whole villages he said in london on friday 
irna reported that iranian troops who were nearby heard 
several huge explosions coming from seyyed sadiq on saturday 
and many buildings in the iraqi town have been demolished 
it said groups of inhabitants were escaping from the town to 
nearby towns and villages 
massud barzani leader of the other big rebel group the kurdish 
democratic party had said several days ago that the iraqi army 
launched a major offensive against the guerrillas march 23 
he said two divisions of troops backed by tanks artillery and 
air strikes were seeking to dislodge rebel fighters and their 
allies the patriotic union of kurdistan from the qara dagh 
mountains between kirkuk and the provincial capital of sulaymaniyah 
an iraqi division usually numbers about 12000 men 
the villages are north of the iranian bridgehead around lake 
darbandikhan where iran claims iraqi chemical bombing attacks 
march 1617 on liberated kurdish towns killed 5000 civilians 
and injured 5000 more 
kuwaits ruler sheik jaber alahmed alsabah said in an 
address at the inauguration of the sixth conference of arab justice 
ministers judging by islamic and arab history we find that 
interislamic wars did not provide any radical solution to 
problems 
he called on iran to abide by the islamic teachings stick to 
good neighborliness and accept reconciliation and dialogue instead 
of aggression and the continuation of war and destruction 
sheik jabers peace appeal came only three days after three 
iranian gunboats opened fire on a military post on kuwaits bubiyan 
island wounding two kuwaiti soldiers

the daring prison escape of the 
leader of the august coup attempt raised new doubts about military 
leadership under president corazon aquinos government 
the flight saturday of former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan with 14 prison guards from an elite navy unit came four 
days after the military boasted of the arrest of seven top 
communist rebels 
how was it possible because he was on a ship and under 
guard sen juan ponce enrile said of the escape how could it 
happen 
honasan 39 served as security chief when enrile now an 
opposition leader was minister of defense 
before dawn saturday honasan fled the prison ship where he had 
been held since his capture in december the 14 officers from the 
navys special warfare unit were supposed to be guarding him but 
they fled with him 
honasan and the guards escaped under gunfire from other guards 
and reached shore in two rubber dinghies a few hundred yards from 
navy headquarters 
in what may be worse for the militarys image spokesman col 
oscar florendo acknowledged the armed forces learned last week of a 
possible escape attempt and had doubled the guard force on the 
ship the dinghies had come with the increased security 
mrs aquino announced saturday that the vessels commander lt 
cmdr fred tuvilla had been arrested and may face courtmartial 
for negligence 
she also threatened to punish any soldiers who help honasan he 
and other military dissidents were responsible for six major coup 
plots against her government 
florendo said honasan was apt to try to organize new plots 
against the government and to divide the 160000member military 
the charismatic former colonel remains widely admired in the 
military even though he was dismissed after his aug 28 coup 
attempt left at least 53 people dead 
his escape was widely reported saturday in the filipino media 
which normally curtail operations on easter weekend scores of 
callers to manila radio stations questioned how honasan could have 
escaped without the help of the guards 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa told reporters 
saturday he accepted responsibility for the escape but would let 
mrs aquino decide whether he should be relieved 
somehow in one way or another i bear responsibility for 
ensuring that our detainees are secured and procedures are 
followed he said 
last month the congressional commission on appointments 
approved de villas nomination as chief of staff 
the move came despite opposition from some congressmen who felt 
the former constabulary commander should have retired instead 
critics said extending his tour of duty limited promotion of 
younger officers and smacked of practices under ousted president 
ferdinand marcos 
the escape also raised doubts whether the congressional 
commission would approve the recent nomination of adm carlito 
cunanan former chief of the coast guard as navy commander 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they already had misgivings about cunanan because of the coast 
guards inept handling of rescue efforts in a december collision of 
a filipino passenger ship and oil tanker that killed 3000 people 
the escape took place as the military was enjoying new prestige 
for tuesdays arrest of seven leading communists including romulo 
kintanar commander of the rebel new peoples army 
defense secretary fidel ramos had said the arrests showed that 
the military had overcome past divisions and could now act 
effectively 
but on saturday he called the escape disturbing news 
de villa said the search for honasan moreover would divert 
military resources from the fight against the rebels 
one filipino politician also worried about the international 
impact of honasans escape sen john osmena said it was bound to 
tarnish the governments image abroad and raise more doubts about 
the stability of the aquino administration

if fallen evangelist jimmy swaggart 
fails to quickly reverse his defiance and accept a yearlong bar on 
preaching and television appearances demanded by the assemblies of 
god the church will move to dismiss him officials say 
swaggart whose worldwide ministry is scrambling to overcome 
financial problems has said he will defy the church order and 
preach again on may 22 only three months after he confessed to 
unspecified sins 
a rift between the churchs leaders over how to discipline 
swaggart was settled friday when the louisiana district council 
announced it would not contest stern sanctions ordered by the 
assemblies general presbytery 
the churchs general presbytery meeting at its national 
headquarters in springfield mo on tuesday banned swaggart from 
the pulpit for at least a year for moral failure that 
reportedly included hiring a prostitute to pose nude 
on friday louisiana church officials said they would go along 
with the order despite their own recommendation that swaggart be 
barred from preaching for only three months 
i would hope he would see the wisdom of submitting himself to 
the judgment of his brothers because there is a strong desire 
to be helpful to the man said the rev thomas zimmerman the 
assemblies retired general superintendent 
on feb 21 swaggart tearfully confessed to unspecified sins and 
stepped down from the pulpit 
on wednesday he announced through his attorney that he would 
return to the pulpit may 22 the end of the threemonth suspension 
recommended by the state council in defiance of the national 
leadership 
what was said at the wednesday press conference still holds 
swaggart spokesman gus weill said friday reverend swaggart is 
still planning to return to the pulpit may 22 and were still 
examining the rights to appeal 
church bylaws however do not allow ministers to appeal 
rehabilitation decisions said juleen turnage a spokeswoman at the 
assemblies national headquarters 
if they havent heard from him swaggart in a few days a 
reasonable period of time theyll assume he is rejecting their 
offer in that case they would move immediately to dismiss him 
she said 
the national office expected to hear from swaggart on monday 
mrs turnage said 
swaggarts ministry is not controlled by the assemblies of god 
officials have said the credentials of the organizations ministers 
are the only direct link with the assemblies the nations largest 
pentecostal denomination 
bill treeby swaggarts lawyer said lack of denomination 
credentials would not affect the ministrys operations 
television appears to be the lifeline for swaggarts ministry 
which includes worldwide missionary and hospital programs a bible 
college and a worship center that seats 5000 
ratings from the ac nielsen co showed swaggarts average 
viewership dropped from more than 1 million households in november 
1986 to 860000 homes a year later as he lost his position as the 
mostwatched tv preacher 
swaggarts ministry conducted a telethon in midmarch in which 
the evangelists wife frances and son donnie warned that many 
programs faced cancellation ministry officials have refused to 
reveal how much money was raised through the telethon 
the march issue of the ministrys magazine the evangelist said 
the organization faced a 147 million deficit through february 
before the sex scandal surfaced the magazines april edition was 
about half the size of those published in previous months 
the ministrys bank account was overdrawn by 2 million 
swaggart said in a march 19 appeal for funds sent to supporters 
the organization recently mortgaged more than 100 acres of 
property to cover a suspended connstruction project and to secure a 
20 million line of credit 
swaggarts ministry has contributed between 103 million and 
114 million annually over the past three years to the assemblies 
foreign missions program turnage said 
there have been indications that a number of people sending 
money to individual organizations will now send through the 
church where there is accountability and they know what the money 
is used for she said

massachusetts gov michael dukakis held a 
narrow lead over the rev jesse jackson in the week leading up to 
tuesdays wisconsin presidential primary according to a newspaper 
poll published sunday 
dukakis held a 43 percent to 35 percent lead over jackson among 
voters who said they would vote for or leaned toward a democratic 
candidate if the primary had been held at the time of the poll the 
milwaukee journal reported in its sunday editions 
in a poll two weeks earlier dukakis led jackson by 38 percent 
to 30 percent the newspaper reported 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee made the largest gain in the 
twoweek period between polls increasing his support from 10 
percent to 15 percent the newspaper said 
despite campaigning heavily in wisconsin sen paul simon of 
illinois slipped from 11 percent support to 5 percent in the two 
weeks the newspaper said 
simon has pinned his fading presidential prospects on wisconsin 
hoping that a victory in the primary would give him a boost going 
into next weeks primary in new york 
on the republican side the poll showed vice president george 
bush would easily defeat his remaining primary challenger former 
television evangelist pat robertson but might have a difficult time 
winning wisconsin in the general election if dukakis were the 
democratic nominee 
bush held an 80 percent to 7 percent lead over robertson the 
poll showed 
however bush and dukakis ended in a virtual tie among voters 
who were asked which of the two they would likely vote for in the 
general election in november 
in similar matchups bush held a 5 point lead over gore and a 14 
point lead over jackson the newspaper said 
the poll was conducted wednesday and thursday and was based on 
interviews with 845 randomlyselected wisconsin adults who said 
they were absolutely or fairly certain to vote in the primary the 
newspaper said the margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage 
points 
the wisconsin primary is expected to draw a large voter turnout 
with as many as 16 million voters or 45 percent of the eligible 
voters participating state elections board officials said

this weeks expected verdict in gov evan 
mechams impeachment trial wont necessarily end the legal morass 
that surrounds the arizona governorship 
the senate plans to vote monday or tuesday on whether mecham a 
firstterm republican should be the first arizona governor removed 
from office 
senators heard five weeks of testimony on allegations that 
mecham misused 80000 in state money by loaning it to his auto 
dealership and that he tried to thwart an investigation of an 
alleged death threat by a state official 
with 20 of the 30 senate votes required for conviction nobody 
is predicting what will happen 
if he is acquitted mecham will automatically regain the 
gubernatorial powers he gave up to acting gov rose mofford the 
democratic secretary of state when he was impeached by the house 
feb 5 
if the senate convicts him on either count mecham will be 
removed from office immediately 
in either event the matter wont necessarily end there 
if acquitted mecham faces two more battles to keep the 
governorship 
a criminal trial is due to start april 21 on a charge similar to 
one impeachment charge the senate dropped failure to report a 
350000 campaign loan the governor faces six felony counts of 
fraud perjury and filing false documents and his brother and 1986 
campaign treasurer willard mecham faces three similar counts 
senators who voted to drop the impeachment count said they 
feared that if they heard evidence on the charge it would 
jeopardize mechams right to a fair trial 
if convicted in the criminal trial mecham would be removed from 
office automatically and could face up to 22 years in prison 
mecham also is running against six candidates in a recall 
election may 17 polls vary widely with some showing him far 
behind but one putting mecham and mrs mofford in a dead heat for 
first place 
if the senate votes to oust him the governor and his defense 
attorney jerris leonard say they could appeal to the us supreme 
court on grounds that mechams constitutional rights were violated 
its also unclear whether the may 17 recall must be held if the 
state senate convicts mecham on the impeachment charges 
attorney general bob corbin a republican said friday he 
believes the recall still must be held because the arizona 
constitution says a recall is aimed at the office not the 
officeholder 
however corbin said he philosophically opposes holding the 
recall if mecham has already been removed 
i dont think our founding fathers who drafted the 
constitution ever dreamed we would be in this position he said 
this and other remaining legal questions should be settled in 
court corbin said 
if the recall were to go ahead following a senate conviction 
officials say its also unclear whether mecham would be allowed to 
run 
he has an automatic spot on the ballot but paul bender dean of 
the arizona state university law school argues that a senate vote 
to remove him would apply to the entire fouryear term and he could 
not remain in office even if he won the recall vote 
legal questions surround mrs moffords gubernatorial candidacy 
too a campaign was formed to draft her because arizonas resign 
to run law apparently would require her to quit as acting 
governor and secretary of state if she declared her candidacy 
a court challenge has been mounted to see if the mofford draft 
campaign was handled properly without any involvement by the 
intended candidate 
corbin said his office warned years ago that the laws were 
unclear and should be straightened out and nobody has so here 
we are

while suds sun and sin may prevail 
among much of the spring break throngs on the wide beaches of 
daytona this easter weekend morning devotions replace hangovers in 
at least three beach hotels 
daytona beach has become a mecca for spring break in recent 
years and an estimated 500000 students descend on the area to 
forget classwork and laze in the sun but its not all rowdy 
parties and promiscuity 
at the beachfront el caribe hotel students carry bibles through 
the lobby the hotel caters to members of the campus crusade for 
christ a national interdenominational group 
you can only get so drunk and sunburned and bored said 
cliff mills director of operation sonshine of the campus crusade 
a lot of them want to know more about christ 
mills whose organization has conducted conferences for some 
3000 students during spring break said campus crusade members 
take their gospel message to the beach in the afternoons and that 
sun worshipers are often receptive 
el caribe does not allow unchaperoned nonmember students under 
21 to rent rooms during spring break 
the difference is day and night said el caribe owner mary 
ann richardson explaining how students in her hotel act compared 
with students staying at the dozens of other beach hotels 
ms richardson said the biggest problem in her hotel is minor 
noise making and that the students are generally wellbehaved and 
polite 
the situation was much the same at the desert inn and the high 
seas motel also spring break gathering places for campus crusade 
members 
there was no muss no fuss and no beerbottle throwing said 
anne madorsky a partowner of the desert inn the voyager and 
americana hotels 
many of the crowds at daytona used to go to fort lauderdale 
before that community began to try to change its image with 
stricter law enforcement 
officials in fort lauderdale have estimated their crowds will 
range between 100000 and 200000 this year compared with 350000 
in 1985 
daytona officials say this spring break students generally have 
behaved better than in the past when hotel guests tossed such 
objects as unopened beer cans room chairs and even rollaway beds 
from balconies 
so far this year there have been two spring break fatalities in 
daytona one a 24yearold man not a student who fell from a 
balcony the other a 21yearold student who was hit by a car 
there were five other balcony falls this year in daytona but 
only two of the six involved students and most resulted in only 
minor injuries in the past three years six deaths have resulted 
from balcony accidents 
in the florida panhandle two spring break visitors were 
hospitalized after balcony falls friday in destin a gulf coast 
resort town 
david jeffers 26 of atlanta fell while doing pullups from a 
fifthfloor balcony railing authorities said he was listed in 
guarded condition at humana hospital in fort walton beach 
david mcgee 18 of baton rouge who fell three floors was in 
stable condition at the same hospital 
evelyn fine executive director of the midflorida research and 
business center of daytona beach community college said some 
500000 students have come to daytona for spring break this year 
and 330000 will have lodged in a hotel for an average stay of 
about five days 
she predicted that each student spends an average of 375 not 
including transportation for a directdollar impact of 1237 
million on the daytona beach economy

the incense vendor accepted a poor 
womans coins and spooned tiny measures of powdered red sandalwood 
honeycrystal myrrh and dried rosemary into scraps of paper 
thirty cents lamented miguel valencia appraising the three 
dimes paid for the incense this is the worst year ever 
the tall ebonyskinned man who peddles crosses and other piety 
objects said he has sold only a 1 portrait of jesus christ since 
midweek 
holy week is usually the best time of year for valencia and the 
small business he runs from a rickety stand in front of the 
metropolitan cathedral indeed the easter holiday usually brings 
joy throughout this country where about 95 percent of 22 million 
people are roman catholic 
but an economic and social crisis over the rule of military 
chief gen manuel antonio noriega has cast a pall over this years 
celebration 
gen noriega under drugtrafficking charges in the united 
states has moved to consolidate control despite increasing us 
pressure on him to step down and leave the country 
he closed banks a month ago to prevent a cash panic after 
washington froze panamanian assets in the united states the 
government has failed to pay most of its 130000 workers and 
private employees have nowhere to cash their checks the money 
crisis worsened nationwide hunger and unemployment 
meanwhile the us government has been stepping up its military 
presence in panama though administration officials say they dont 
intend to use force to oust the strongman they once backed another 
1300 military personnel will arrive tuesday bringing to nearly 
12000 the number of us troops there 
the administration says the troops are intended to protect us 
bases and 45000 americans living in panama 
never have we panamanians lived a lent with such tension 
division and increasing want in great sectors of the country 
said a catholic church statement the people suffer and await the 
feast of the resurrection that it may signal some light of hope 
few panamanians saw cause for optimism the church said saturday 
that opposition leaders had accepted a church role as mediator in 
the countrys travail but the opposition continued to demand that 
noriega leave the country something he has doggedly refused to do 
many people in the streets expressed despair over unremitting 
price increases and hunger fresh fish a typical easter meal in 
years past has risen beyond modest means in this isthmus between 
the atlantic and pacific oceans 
many hunkered down in the capital of panama city forgoing 
customary visits with family in the provinces to protect 
diminishing savings department of transportation agent roger 
chacon said outbound traffic through la chorrera the main gate to 
the countryside was extremely light all week 
external calm replaced weeks of political activity and 
demonstrations in panama city police replaced the heavily armed 
defense forces soldiers on the street friday for the first time 
since an unsuccessful march 16 coup attempt against noriega 
five men conversed on 17th street downtown two sat on a 
workshop bench carried out to the sidewalk and three others stood 
while all sipped a mixture of rum milk and ice from paper cups 
none of us would be here now if it werent for the crisis 
said a man in a sleeveless tshirt and shorts wed be in 
chiriqui where its cool 
the mountainous western province is a favorite tourist spot in 
better times 
so our recreation is conversation and a couple drinks said 
another in a blue guayabera the loosefitting tropical shirt 
inevitably talk turned to the crisis all five said they 
opposed noriega one suggested that out of the 2 million 
panamanians 200 support him 
because of fear of reprisals none wanted his name published 
some of the men also talked bitterly of how us sanctions were 
making their holiday and their lives difficult 
panama has been a good friend to the united states for more 
than 80 years said one and it hurts more to be wounded by a 
friend 
and all doubted that the population stymied by government 
repression could do much to change things after the holiday

the national rifle association is 
trying to get this citys interim police chief ousted saying he 
unfairly charged a service station owner with illegal possession of 
a handgun after a robbery 
in a letter mailed to nra members here friday one of the 
organizations national directors asks for help in keeping keith 
bergstrom from bringing his campaign against lawabiding gun 
owners to tarpon springs 
the letter told members they should to voice their opposition 
tuesday when city commissioners meet to consider permanently 
appointing bergstrom as chief 
in question is bergstroms enforcement of an antigun ordinance 
while he was police chief in oak park ill an april 1984 measure 
banned possession of a handgun within the city limits 
i find it very ironic that the nra in effect is criticizing me 
for obeying the law and being accountable to the people who make 
the law bergstrom said friday 
oak park police charged service station owner don bennett with 
violating the ordinance when following a robbery at his station in 
1986 he chased the suspects and fired at them with a 45caliber 
pistol bergstrom said 
bennett ultimately was acquitted 
the police department and their attorneys spent all of their 
efforts in prosecuting don bennett and there was never an attempt 
to find the robbers said theodore a lattanzio the 
washingtonbased nra official who wrote the letter they were 
trying to prosecute a man who tried to use a weapon in 
selfdefense 
bergstrom who came to tarpon springs in october 1987 denied 
the nra accusations 
bennett has filed a federal lawsuit naming bergstrom two oak 
park police officers and another city official and seeking more 
than 2 million in compensatory damages and 1 million in punitive 
damages from each defendant 
the lawsuit alleges the defendants were part of a conspiracy to 
prevent him from doing business bennett said friday

a 60yearold easter tradition a sidewalk 
display of live easter bunnies may bow to protests and be gone 
next year the florist who sets it up said saturday 
it will be determined by the public if they want us to have 
the rabbits next year we suggest that they write in to us said 
arthur scheinuk owner of scheinuk the florist 
he said he wanted tangible support for the display not just 
comments from people who walk into the store 
just to come here and say i was here as a young kid and now 
im bringing my grandchildren without bringing some moral support 
you get a little disgusted 
the fencedin display in which dozens of adult and baby rabbits 
hop around a lawn or snuggle in wooden boxes cut to resemble 
buildings along st charles ave opens 10 days before easter and 
lasts until easter sunday 
scheinuk said thousands of adults and children come to look at 
the rabbits every year some buy them for 1090 each a price at 
which scheinuk said he makes no profit 
for the past several years the display also has attracted 
pickets people who say selling live rabbits for easter gifts 
amounts to animal cruelty because the bunnies all too often wind up 
at animal shelters 
we suggested to them they would do beter telling unwed mothers 
how to take care of their children scheinuk said 
to add injury to insult 15 rabbits were stolen late thursday or 
early friday by someone who cut an 8inchsquare hole in the 
chainlink cage 
in this weather that weve had these flooded conditions 
police have too much to do than to fool with rabbit stealers he 
said

defendants in white robes waited in cages in 
a makeshift courtroom as the trial began saturday for the 33 moslem 
fundamentalists accused of using terror to disrupt the government 
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 15 defendants two 
of whom remain at large for allegedly trying to kill two former 
government ministers and a magazine editor 
they are seeking penalties for the others of up to life in 
prison 
the defendants pleaded innocent and said they were tortured and 
abused by state security policemen and prosecutors during 
questioning the prosecution denied the allegations 
the 15 facing possible death sentences are charged with forming 
an illegal organization called salvation from hell with the 
intent of destabilizing the government through assassinations and 
other attacks 
they are charged with the attempted murders last year of former 
interior ministers hassan abu basha on may 6 and elnabawi ismail 
on aug 13 and magazine editor makram mohammed ahmed on june 4 
abu basha was wounded seriously ahmed sustained a minor hand 
wound and ismail was not injured 
all of the defendants are accused of illegally possessing 
firearms explosives and pamphlets that contained information 
designed to incite antigovernment violence 
security was strong outside the courtroom with at least four 
armored personnel carriers and scores of armed soldiers present 
the 4hour session before chief judge omar eloteify of the 
supreme state security court and two fellow judges dealt mainly 
with procedural matters 
the 31 defendants in custody sat or stood in three cages in the 
courtroom a renovated exhibition hall 
white banners hanging on the cages iron bars proclaimed the 
moslems are coming and prison and execution wont move us away 
from islam the defendants chanted similar slogans 
attorney abdelhalim mandour speaking for the group of 47 
defense lawyers told the court that police fabricated evidence 
against the defendants 
there is no illegal organization this is a fabrication from 
the state security mandour said it is an attempt by these 
people to strike against islam and religious men

a developer who is buying a marine 
laboratory in the florida keys from harcourt brace jovanovich inc 
says he plans to build a resort but also hopes to preserve the 
research facility 
henk mastenbroek who has developed several timeshare vacation 
properties in the keys agreed to pay 700000 for the 7acre sea 
world marine science and conservation center the only operating 
facility of its kind in the country an official at the florida 
institute of oceanography said the marine laboratory was unique 
because of its access to tropical waters 
the lab is being sold by the book publishing company harcourt 
brace jovanovich inc which has been under pressure to sell real 
estate and other assets to repay creditors after fending off a 
hostile takeover bid last year the marine lab was used to collect 
sharks and tropical fish for hbjs sea world theme parks 
the company had agreed to sell the laboratory to the florida 
institute of oceanography an arm of the state university system 
but the deal fell through when the hbj realized there was no 
guarantee that the legislature would allocate money for the 
purchase said jim harris senior vice president of hbj land co 
mastenbroek agreed to pay the same price the state would have 
paid he said although he planned to build a resort on the site he 
hoped he could maintain the lab built in 1978 the orlando 
sentinel reported in saturdays editions 
an administrator at the institute of oceanography said she 
doubted that the marine laboratory would remain intact 
our problem is they the developers keep saying they have to 
make money out of it which isnt too likely sandra vargo a 
project coordinator at the institute ive seen too many research 
facilities and theyre not money makers 
three years ago the institute contracted with hbj to use the 
marine center for its own research about 400 community college and 
university students visit the center every year for a weeklong 
course on marine biology 
currently the department of natural resources is growing 10000 
conchs there to determine whether they can be grown to reseed 
depleted conch beds state and university researchers also are 
studying the lobster population to determine whether the creature 
has been overfished and needs protection 
vargo said the only other sites under us control where similar 
research could be conducted were in puerto rico and st croix

democratic presidential hopefuls michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson campaigned saturday for momentum and paul 
simon fought for survival in this weeks wisconsin primary as the 
state reclaimed its historic role as a decisive crossroad on the 
long nomination trail 
dukakis and jackson are locked in a close wisconsin contest 
whose outcome could label one the frontrunner in the 1988 race 
both men were in wisconsin and colorado on saturday preparing 
for colorados precinct caucuses monday that will set the stage for 
the wisconsin balloting tuesday 
dukakis delivering a major foreign policy speech saturday at 
the university of wisconsin at oshkosh offered strong support for 
israel while blaming arab leaders for the failure to achieve peace 
in the middle east 
at a news conference later dukakis said he disagreed with 
jacksons embrace of plo leader yasser arafat and his position that 
israel and the palestinians are moral equivalents 
jackson who was campaigning near greeley colo kept his 
attack on the reagan administration which he said has the most 
indictments the most corruption the highest sleaze factor in the 
history of american government we deserve better government we 
deserve honorable leaders 
in wisconsin both candidates have laid down a clear appeal to 
the bluecollar workers who are critical to democratic success in 
the state 
i have argued your case ive stood with you and with the 
working people of america jackson told a crowd at st norbert 
college near green bay late friday and now i want you to stand 
with me 
dukakis turned his fire on the coporations 
if were serious about winning the battle for our economic 
future weve got to get control of the merger and acquisition 
binge thats leaving the average working men and women of 
america holding the bag he said in racine 
the two other democrats sens simon of illinois and albert 
gore jr of tennessee ignored colorado in favor of wisconsin 
the latest poll published sunday in the milwaukee journal 
showed dukakis with a 43 percent to 35 percent lead over jackson 
among voters who said they would vote for or leaned toward a 
democratic candidate gore received 15 percent and simon was fourth 
with 5 percent the poll conducted last wednesday and thursday 
among 845 likely voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
percentage points 
this is the most important primary vote we have had since 1960 
because of the closeness of the race said suellen albrecht 
chairwoman of the wisconsin democrats this is our moment in the 
sun 
simon put the rest of his chips on wisconsin playing for an 
upset that would keep his hopes alive the polls suggested his 
effort could end next week 
not since 1960 has wisconsin had a chance to say in such 
concrete terms we want a basic change simon told a crowd in 
madison last week 
in 1960 thensen john kennedy upset sen hubert humphrey in 
the wisconsin primary and took a big step toward the white house 
gore is making a major effort in the state with hard campaigning 
and a big investment in television ads a surpising showing in 
wisconsin could be a big boost for what gore has set as his pivotal 
contest two weeks hence in the new york primary 
the republican primary in wisconsin is drawing little attention 
since sen bob dole dropped his bid last week leaving the 
nomination wrapped up for vice president george bush there are 47 
gop delegates at stake 
the lack of a republican race adds uncertainty for the 
democrats since the wisconsin open primary law allows gop faithful 
to vote in the stilldisputed democratic race 
id welcome any republican into the democratic party who wants 
to vote for any candidate we have if the vote is given 
sincerely ms albrecht said this is the very nightmare that 
we had with the national party four years ago 
while academic experts say crossover voters have never made the 
difference between winning and losing democrats were upset when 
republican gov tommy thompson said last week he would vote for 
jackson if he were a democrat thompson later said he was not 
trying to encourage crossover voting 
in the delegate race dukakis held a narrow margin 65355 to 
64655 for jackson gore held 3818 votes and simon 1695 a total 
of 4686 votes are uncommitted at the july convention 2082 votes 
are needed to win the nomination 
jackson got a threedelegate boost saturday wehn he swept the 
party caucuses in the us virgin islands party vice chairman st 
claire williams said jackson got 634 votes while dukakis trailed 
with only 37 votes they were the only two candidates on the caucus 
ballot 
six people who each will cast onehalf vote as delegates to the 
democratic national convention were chosen in saturdays caucuses 
in the us territory 
the wisconsin primary offers 88 democratic delegates but that 
is not the big prize the winner in wisconsin has the chance to 
start momentum for a fiveweek stretch of bigstate primaries that 
could decide the nomination 
dukakis is looking for a bigstate win to get his campaign back 
on track after jackson derailed it with a win on march 26 in the 
michigan precinct caucuses 
the massachusetts governor has started to retool his campaign 
style unveiling a new speech in milwaukee thursday night dukakis 
sometimes called a cold technocrat admitted that he will never be 
the great communicator in the mold of ronald reagan but what 
he called a great builder 
jackson is looking to keep on winning particularly in a state 
where his base black democrats is so small less than 4 percent 
of the states population is black 
but jackson has made a major effort to reach out to bluecollar 
workers and farmers and has drawn dramatically large and 
enthusiastic crowds in that effort 
hes one of us not a washington bigwig said dave dittman 
from st croix county as he attended a big farm rally for jackson 
in the northern dairy country 
a poll published in this weeks editions of us news amp world 
report said that if jackson became dukakis vice presidential 
running mate the democrats could defeat the gop ticket regardless 
of who became bushs running mate a dukakisjackson ticket was 
supported by 47 percent of the 1004 people contacted last week by 
telephone for the poll while a hypothetical gop ticket of bush and 
illinois gov jim thompson would win 42 percent 
the poll conducted by the roper organization has a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points

a stress test showed the space shuttles 
redesigned solid rocket boosters apparently can withstand the 
weight of the orbiter launch pressures and then some a nasa 
spokesman said saturday 
the structural load test was another step in certifying the 
space shuttle for flight said ed medal a spokesman for the 
national aeronautics and space administration at its marshall space 
flight center 
hydraulic systems were used to apply pressures to a shortened 
solid rocket booster the test section was subjected to forces 
equaling 150 percent of those normally experienced during launch 
he said 
the booster rocket was not fired 
detailed analysis of the load condition will be conducted 
over the next several weeks but it appears the test was 
successsful in demonstrating the capability required with reserve 
for returning the shuttle to flight status said medal 
he said the test booster with included a flared aft skirt like 
the two that support the shuttles weight on the launch pad failed 
at the predicted weld when subjected to excessive pressures during 
the friday night procedure 
this test demonstrated a capability greater than that tested 
prior to the first shuttle launch said medal 
the shuttle fleet has been grounded since the jan 28 1986 
explosion of challenger in which seven people died investigators 
blamed the disaster on a failed solid rocket booster joint that 
allowed flames to burn into the vehicles huge external fuel tank 
nasa hopes to resume shuttle flights this summer

the mormon church on saturday reported a 
record increase in converts during 1987 and leaders warned members 
against ostracizing nonmormons in the churchs utah stronghold 
leaders also announced the appointment of two new members of the 
leadership hierarchy and named a new president to the churchs 
organization for children 
mormon missionaries baptized 227284 new members last year 
compared to 216210 in 1986 according to the annual statistical 
report of the 65millionmember church 
the membership report was delivered on the opening day of the 
158th annual general conference of the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints 
the twoday conference has drawn thousands of mormons from 
around the world to hear sermons from the churchs hierarchy 
including president ezra taft benson 88 who is considered a 
prophet 
robert e sackley 65 bow island canada and l lionel 
kendrick 56 greenville nc were named new members of the 
seventy fulltime clergy who assist the governing first presidency 
in directing the church sackley is currently president of the 
churchs mission in nigeria while kendrick is directing missionary 
efforts in the tampa fla area 
michaelene packer grassli was named president of the childrens 
program primary she succeeds dwan j young who is leaving the 
position to accompany her husband who has been appinted president 
of the calgary canada mission 
the churchs success in proselytizing has been accompanied by a 
sharp increase in its missionary force which has grown to 34750 
men and women compared to 31803 during 1986 
outside the church many watch in amazement at this consistent 
expansion in spite of popular secularism said david b haight 
of the council of the twelve apostles the twelve are fulltime 
clergy who assist the threemember first presidency in directing 
the church the seventy follow the twelve in the hierarchy 
but while leaders celebrated the growth they warned members to 
avoid religious arrogance particularly in utah where nonmembers 
often complain that they are excluded from politics and social life 
about twothirds of utahs 16 million people are mormon and 
church members hold nearly all major political offices the 
governor and the congressional delegation are members more than 80 
percent of the legislature is mormon including the senate 
president house speaker and the majority leaders in both chambers 
numerical superiority does not justify disdain for those who are 
not mormon said dallin h oaks a member of the twelve and former 
utah supreme court justice 
he said he recently received a letter in which the writer 
complained that newcomers who are not mormon arrive in utah to find 
themselves excluded at best and ostracized at worst 
that sentiment was demonstrated last week when sacramento 
calif developer john roberts turned down a job as chief of the 
privately run utah economic development corp saying the state has 
an image of being inhospitable to nonmormons i was asked what 
my religion was more in one afternoon in salt lake city than i have 
in my entire life roberts said

jd dull stewart 
selfproclaimed leader of international dull folks unlimited 
crashed the seventh annual national humor conference saturday to 
panhandle for his mythical presidential candidacy 
stewart a statistical analyst from rochester ny became the 
champion of dullards everywhere with the creation of densa an 
organization whose name stands for nothing except as a sendup of 
the highiq society mensa 
talking to a roomful of professors gathered at purdue university 
for a serious study of humor in american society stewart made his 
money pitch i said im in room 228 in the union club you can 
just leave your 250 checks ouside the door i havent seen any 
yet 
stewart is actually a registered participant and welcome said 
don nilsen an arizona state university professor 
stewarts kind of selfdeprecating humor won a nod of 
appreciation from the professors its funny because its a 
reversal said nilsen its an opposite of expectations 
whatever our frustrations are we have ways of dealing with those 
frustrations by using this kind of humor 
its more sophisticated than oneliner humor that commonly 
targets ethnic groups politicians or sex he said 
its a coping device he said you have to develop coping 
devices for the real problems of the world 
another researcher rhoda lee fisher of the state university of 
new york said stewarts style has lot in common with many 
successful professional comedians despite success and the 
admiration of the audience genuine selfdoubt remains she 
explained 
in fact most comedians come across as being down and up at 
the same time she said they tell us theyre silly but we 
secretly know they are special and brave and doing something most 
of us would not have the fortitude to attempt 
the fourday humor conference attended by about 70 professors 
from a variety of disciplines runs through monday studies will be 
presented on humor and business management the humor of 
intentional mispronunciation and a paper titled the continuing

the sunday times of london said there is a secret 
israeli operation under way to sell advanced missile technology to 
china 
it said israel sent a fiveman team of military specialists to 
china in november and a deal was made to supply the chinese armed 
forces with missile warheads and armorpiercing devices developed 
by israel 
the newspaper identified one of the men it said traveled to 
china but did not give further attribution 
it said there are indications israel has been helping china 
develop its own multipurpose combat fighter plane using technology 
derived from the canceled israeli lavi fighter the united states 
had helped finance development of the lavi and the program was 
dropped after washington complained about delays and rising costs 
western intelligence agencies have suspected for some time 
that there is a link between israeli expertise and the speed china 
has shown in developing advanced weaponry the sunday times said 
according to the newspaper the arms deal was supervised by 
reuven merhav who it said is israels consul general in hong kong 
and formerly worked for mossad israels secret service 
israel and china do not have diplomatic relations 
the sunday times said five men flew to the chinese capital of 
beijing using passports from the philippines it identified one of 
the men as israel radomsky and said he was program manager of the 
stateowned israel military industries imi radomsky 
reluctantly admitted that he and his team traveled to china 
the report said adding 
he also said that far from being a rogue operation the 
covert mission to china had been cleared at the highest levels of 
the israel government 
the newspaper said the other four members of the delegation were 
all experts in imis missile division 
lawmaker anthony beaumontdark of the governing conservative 
party said saturday night that britain should freeze all technology 
and information exchanges with israel until it explains the deal 
with china 
he said foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe should tell israel 
the arrangement is totally unacceptable 
we cannot go on sharing things with people who want to sell it 
to a potential adversary for mercenary reasons or with people we 
cannot trust beaumontdark said 
the sunday times said israel officially denies arms ties with 
china but janes defense weekly the authoritative military 
affairs magazine estimates the trade is already worth as much as 
three billion dollars 
it claimed china wanted to keep its military links with israel 
secret for fear of harming its position in the middle east 
israel sought secrecy because a missile deal with china would 
antagonize the united states which has expressed concern about 
chinas sale of silkworm missiles to iran according to the sunday 
times

the party of former opposition leader 
joshua nkomo voted saturday to merge with the ruling party of prime 
minister robert mugabe in a step to unite the nations most 
powerful political movements 
nkomo president of the zimbabwe african peoples union opened 
the partys oneday congress with a plea to more than 5000 
delegates to endorse a unity accord he signed with mugabe on dec 
23 
nkomo said this accord opens up broad vistas for the economy 
of the country through the participation of all the people in 
development 
nkomo 70 needed a simple majority vote to endorse the merger 
but the congress passed two resolutions by unanimous vote the 
resolutions approved the merger and asked nkomo and mugabe to 
proceed with uniting their parties structures under one banner 
effectively dismantling nkomos party 
this country will owe a lot to your decisions nkomo said 
after the vote we have a collective vision we must stand 
together we must not deceive each other 
mugabes zimbabwe african national union is to vote on the unity 
accord on april 9 
mugabe and nkomo originally were allies in the campaign to bring 
majority black rule to the country that was the whiteruled british 
colony of rhodesia 
in 1963 mugabe and some other officials left nkomos party to 
form their own leftist movement 
both parties were outlawed by thenprime minister ian smiths 
whitedominated government in 1964 nkomo and mugabe along with 
hundreds of other black nationalists were detained for more than a 
decade 
mugabe and nkomo then became leaders in a sevenyear guerrilla 
war that ended when the country became independent on april 18 
1980 the alliance mugabe and nkomo had formed during the war came 
apart after mugabes party won zimbabwes first election after 
independence 
nkomo and mugabe remained political foes until dec 23 when 
they signed the unity accord that signaled an end to frequent 
fighting between their supporters in january nkomo was appointed 
one of three senior cabinet ministers in a government shuffle 
if both parties approve the merger mugabe 64 will have the 
support of all but one legislator in the 100seat national assembly 
and the 40member senate he needs the vote of all 140 lawmakers to 
change the constitution and establish a oneparty socialist state 
that he advocates 
the dissident lawmaker is businessman goodson sithole but 
political observers say he could join mugabes party before a vote 
is taken in parliament later this year 
in another development a gang of men stabbed to death a white 
zimbabwean farmer at his home and beat his wife unconscious police 
reported saturday 
they said the body of johannes du toit 55 was found by the 
family cook friday in the farmhouse near the town of karoi 112

greek bakers in detroit worked overtime making easter bread a 
small illinois town carried on a russian womans decorating 
tradition and pastors all over fretted saturday that the start of 
daylightsaving time would make parishioners tardy for services 
in eastern texas where tornadoes ripped through east mountain 
mound city gladewater and union grove friday night hundreds of 
people banded together and spent their easter weekend cleaning up 
debris 
pastor dick lindsey of east mountain baptist church pastor dick 
lindsey said sundays service will focus on the storm that damaged 
or destroyed 46 homes 
even though weve gone through difficulties and a loss of 
property there still is hope and thats what the resurrection is 
all about a new life lindsey said saturday 
many pastors shared a less serious worry on easter eve whether 
congregants would remember to set their clocks an hour ahead before 
going to bed 
i know theres been concern said pastor william deheyman of 
redeemer lutheran church in philadelphia 
it was a stuck drawbridge not an unset clock that delayed the 
easter bunny from his appointed round saturday morning in grand 
haven mich the local jaycees held up their egg hunt until the 
guest of honor could arrive 
for sundays easter egg hunt in terre haute ind organizers 
were plotting how to foil overzealous parents who cheat to help 
their children win prizes more than 1000 children were expected 
to participate in the event at deming park in one of indianas 
biggest annual easter egg hunts 
in the past adults have painted winning numbers on eggs or 
found the highly coveted gold and silver eggs and passed them off 
to their kids said georgeo schoffstall of the american legion 
which sponsors the event 
sixty monitors will be on hand to keep parents from collecting 
any of the nearly 2000 hidden eggs we could use a 150 
schoffstall said 
for more than 50 years passersby in bement ill marveled at 
the thousands of colored eggs plastic rabbits and ducks and 
statues of geese and goslings that adorned zenaida drakes yard 
although mrs drake died last fall at age 73 her spirit lives 
on thanks to some oldfashioned community spirit and mrs drakes 
husband bill who donated the decorations to the bement community 
council 
some of the council members went to the drake home on friday 
and the bement girl scout troop pitched in to set out the same 
decorations that the russian woman had displayed for nearly half a 
century many of which she had made herself 
she always told us that in the old country they decorated for 
easter like we do for christmas so she brought the tradition with 
her said gary jennings president of the council 
a 60year tradition in new orleans of showing off live bunnies 
before easter may be dropped next year says the florist who sets 
up the elaborate display 
the fencedin display in which dozens of adult and baby rabbits 
hop around a lawn or snuggle in wooden boxes cut to resemble 
buildings along st charles ave opens 10 days before easter and 
lasts until easter sunday 
arthur scheinuk owner of scheinuk the florist says thousands 
come to see and sometimes buy the rabbits but the display has been 
picketed by activists charging animal cruelty

the reagan administration so far 
has rejected using military force to oust panamanian strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega a white house spokesman said saturday 
marlin fitzwater scoffed at reports of a clamoring within the 
state department for tougher measures to push noriega out saying 
the panamanian problem has presented a fertile ground for rich 
imaginations 
several news reports have said that secretary of state george p 
shultz urged in highlevel white house meetings that the united 
states attempt to kidnap noriega who is under indictment in this 
country on drugtrafficking charges 
the washington post reported in sundays editions that the 
administration also considered establishing headquarters in the 
former canal zone for panamanian president eric arturo delvalle 
who has been in hiding since noriega ousted him in february and 
surrounding the area with us military forces so delvalle could 
campaign more effectively for noriegas removal 
fitzwater on saturday sought to minimize reports indicating the 
administration was weighing military or covert action moves to get 
noriega out of power 
and shultz speaking with reporters in rome saturday as he 
continued a mideast peacemaking mission sidestepped questions 
about his advice to reagan 
we debate various possible options shultz said but 
basically this is a question of a person who no longer is wanted 
in his country the position of the united states government is 
that he should go everybody agrees about that hes been 
indicted 
shultz steadfastly refused to get into a debate about he options 
he has proposed saying that i never comment on speculative news 
articles 
the los angeles times reported in saturdays editions that 
shultz and assistant secretary of state elliott abrams also had 
urged the dispatch of about 3000 us military forces to panama to 
further undermine noriegas grip on power 
the state department it said was displeased with the 
pentagons decision to bolster the us military presence in panama 
by sending about 1300 troops many of them military police 
officers 
but fitzwater described the deployment of these forces 
beginning early this week as simply a continuation of the us 
effort to strengthen security for americans in the troubled central 
american country 
there have been any number of offensive plans raised but to 
this point they have been rejected he said 
fitzwater said the united states intentions in panama is to 
protect us assets and the approximately 40000 american 
citizens living there 
clearly the decisions at this point have been limited to 
defensive options he said reinforcing security in panama 
we want to be sure we have enough troops to protect our 40000 
citizens there 
deputy white house press secretary leslye arsht said the whole 
range of diplomatic political and military options have been 
considered the kinds of things being reported can be considered in 
that category 
she said the only decision the president has made is to 
enhance the security forces as announced by the pentagon 
fitzwater declined to be drawn into a discussion of the reported 
feud between shultz and defense secretary frank c carlucci over 
the options to be pursued in panama 
but the spokesman did say that the decision to send the 
additional 1300 troops to the county was made by carlucci with 
reagans approval 
fitzwater had said friday that reagan would be kept abreast of 
the panamanian situation as he and his wife nancy vacation this 
week at their mountaintop ranch near here national security 
adviser colin d powell accompanied reagan to california and is 
staying at a hotel in santa barbara along with several other 
presidential aides 
the united states so far has mainly applied economic sanctions 
and diplomatic pressure to oust noriega but the administrations 
moves have not succeeded 
late last week the administration said it was considering a 
plan to seek the withholding of tax payments owed to panama by us 
corporations that do business there

the guns are silent for the time being in 
nicaragua and there is even a truce of sorts between republicans 
and democrats on the contentious issue of aid to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
and as nicaraguas leftist government and the usbacked rebels 
prepare to negotiate a settlement to end their sixyear war the 
reagan administration has remained uncharacteristically silent no 
longer using apocalyptic terms to discuss its perception of the 
stakes involved 
along with its rhetoric the administration is lowering its 
expectations of its ability to influence events in the region but 
most officials believe the sandinista government is going into the 
peace talks in a commanding position because of contra military 
weakness 
for now almost everyone from the sandinista government to 
administration and congressional hardliners believes the peace 
process should be allowed to go forward without guns ablaze 
just a few weeks ago bipartisanship on the contra aid issue 
seemed beyond reach an administration aid proposal was defeated 
narrowly in the house on feb 3 and a substitute democratic plan 
also was rejected by a slim margin a few weeks later 
but this past week both houses of congress overwhelmingly 
approved a 48 million package providing humanitarian aid for the 
contras as well as for children on both sides who have been injured 
in the conflict the package includes 10 million for independent 
verification of the ceasefire agreement 
following contra acquiescence to a 60day ceasefire on march 
23 both republicans and democrats agreed that this type of aid 
package was the only option available to them but the legislation 
also includes a promise by house speaker jim wright dtexas that 
he will not block fair and orderly consideration of a new 
military aid request if the peace talks collapse due to sandinista 
intransigence 
sen christopher dodd dconn noted that the aid bill did not 
provide weapons for the rebels as contra supporters had hoped and 
it went too far for contra opponents who object to sending any aid 
this package strikes a balance dodd said during an 
unusually harmonious floor debate on the proposal last thursday 
dodd said the sole purpose of the package is to support the 
ceasefire agreement if not for that agreement we wouldnt be 
doing this today 
the official administration line is that the temporary 
ceasefire was a step forward and it is now up to the disputants 
to resolve their differences at the bargaining table when peace 
talks begin 
those talks were scheduled to begin wednesday but the contras 
said saturday they would delay the talks for one week to provide 
more time for technical commissions of both sides to work out 
details of the five zones inside nicaragua where rebel forces are 
to gather under the provisions of the ceasefire accord 
but a government statement signed saturday by deputy foreign 
minister victor hugo tinoco stressed it was extremely important 
to comply with the ceasefire pacts timetable and stick by the 
april 6 meeting date 
the administrations lowkey attitude was symbolized by 
president reagans decision on friday to sign the aid legislation 
in his white house residence forgoing the ceremonial fanfare that 
attends some billsignings 
the administration has long contended that the sandinistas will 
be forced to democratize and demilitarize only through contra 
military pressure or at least the threat of it 
just last february reagan said the sandinista government will 
be free to continue the consolidation of their totalitarian regime 
the military buildup inside nicaragua and communist subversion of 
their neighbors if military aid to the contras stops 
the administration has not renounced reagans grim prediction 
but it appears that an informal moratorium has been placed on that 
type of rhetoric 
things have been quiet in nicaragua as well a formal ceasefire 
replaced the temporary one on friday and the nicaraguan defense 
ministry reported no violations 
many nicaraguans marked the long easter weekend by taking 
vacations at beaches on the pacific coast banks government 
offices stores and most restaurants were closed until monday 
when talks on a permanent truce begin the contras are expected 
to issue demands for 17 democratic reforms abolition of the draft 
the repatriation soviet bloc military advisers and other measures 
in effect they will be asking the sandinistas to negotiate the 
revolution something the government has said it would never do 
the process is not expected to be free of friction

police arrested 11 protesters who moved into 
vacant apartments at a public housing project saturday but did not 
arrest demonstrators who set up a nearby tent city officials said 
the 11 who were arrested at the chicago housing authoritys 
henry horner homes were charged with criminal trespass and released 
on 100 bond apiece said officer richard touhy he said police 
were called to the buildings by housing authority security guards 
the protesters were members of the chicagogary area union of 
the homeless and moved into the vacant apartments as part of a 
twopronged demonstration on behalf of the citys estimated 25000 
homeless 
the other half of the demonstration involved setting up a dozen 
tents on a vacant lot nearby 
union members vowed to stay in the tents for a week saying they 
wanted to call attention to the housing authoritys refusal to 
allow the homeless to stay in its vacant apartments 
several members of the union said they would try to move back 
into the apartments where the 11 were arrested 
dolores thomas a secretary for the union said this weekend was 
chosen for the protest because april 1 is the date that half of the 
cityrun shelters and warming centers for the homeless were closed 
this year she estimated that about 500 people had to go back on 
the streets because of the seasonal move

the carter administration considered an 
armsforhostages swap in 1980 but scuttled the plan because of 
doubts about the iranian gobetween newly declassified documents 
show 
president carter considered offering 10 million in military 
spare parts for 52 americans held hostage at the us embassy in 
tehran the miami herald reported in sunday editions 
however the administration backed away from the plan after 
deciding arms dealer houshang lavi did not have the backing of 
abolhassan banisadr then president of iran the newspaper 
reported 
under the reagan administration the us sold arms to iran in 
exchange for the release of some american hostages held in lebanon 
funds from the sale were diverted to contra rebels at a time when 
such aid was banned by congress 
the declassified documents mostly carterera cia and state 
department memos provide the first detailed account of carter 
efforts to extricate the hostages before the 1980 election which 
ronald reagan won by a landslide 
lavi an iranianborn resident of new yorks long island became 
involved with the carter administration after first contacting the 
campaign of independent presidential candidate john anderson the 
documents gave no indication whether the reagan campaign was 
approached 
the documents were turned over to rep john conyers dmich 
chairman of the house judiciary criminal justice subcommittee as 
part of his investigation into whether reagans 1980 campaign made 
a secret armsforhostages deal with iran 
one of the cia memos dated oct 3 1980 mentioned a 
conversation between an unidentified agency officer and lavi in 
which he offered to make the hostage exchange and handed over a a 
sevenpage list of f14 parts 
lavi wished to arrange the delivery to iran of 8 million to 
10 million of f14 spare parts the memo said adding he would 
arrange the swap of all the hostages upon the delivery of the spare 
parts and us agreement to unfreeze iranian assets forgive 
claims against iran and stay out of internal iranian affairs 
the cia officer recommended against pursuing the offer 
the memos indicate carter officials ended contacts with lavi on 
oct 19 1980 after a foreign ambassador in tehran reported that 
banisadr had not been aware of lavis offer 
wlstv in chicago reported oct 15 1980 that armsforhostages 
talks were under way and a 1984 congressional investigation 
concluded the leak came from a highly placed member of the us 
intelligence community associated with the reagan campaign

nicaraguan rebels on saturday said 
they would delay talks with the sandinista government for one week 
but the government called on the contras to stick to the original 
timetable for discussing a lasting peace 
the highlevel talks between delegations from the government and 
rebels known as contras were scheduled to begin on wednesday in 
managua 
a rebel leader indicated the contras wanted more time for 
technical commissions of both sides to work out details of the five 
zones inside nicaragua where rebel forces are to gather under the 
provisions of a 60day ceasefire accord 
adolfo calero one of the top contra leaders said in a 
telephone interview from miami that the rebel delegation will not 
meet with the sandinistas until april 12 
we feel its not violating the accord calero said of the 
postponement 
a government statement saturday signed by deputy foreign 
minister victor hugo tinoco stressed it was extremely important 
to comply with the ceasefire pacts timetable and stick by the 
april 6 meeting date 
the statement said the government considered it 
counterproductive to postpone the april 6th highlevel meeting 
tinoco said the contras showed a tendency to systematic lack 
of compliance with the agreedupon calendar of the accord 
the agreement to meet wednesday in managua which would be the 
first talks between the two sides in the nicaraguan capital had 
been reached in negotiations last month in the village of sapoa 
beside the border with costa rica 
a tinoco letter released saturday night which apparently had 
been prepared before the contras insisted on a postponement 
disclosed plans for the wednesday meeting 
it said arrangements had been made for the talks to be held in 
managuas hotel las mercedes beginning at 4 pm as is stipulated 
in the sapoa accords 
the letter addressed to rebel leaders said sandinista and costa 
rican officials were to guarantee the contra delegations security 
it added the government would consider counterproductive any type 
of political activity outside the framework and objective of the 
managua meeting 
usbacked rebel and leftist govenment leaders signed an 
agreement march 23 aimed at ending the more than sixyear war the 
sandinistas met the first parts of the plan by freeing 100 
political prisoners holding technical talks on the ceasefire and 
formally enacting the 60day ceasefire on friday 
but the two days of technical talks among military officers from 
both sides failed to net desired results for the contras according 
to the ceasefire agreement the rebels are to move into zones 
during the first 15 days of april while talks go on for the 
duration of the 60day ceasefire 
the two sides agreed to five zones but failed to specify their 
size or exact locations nor did they work out operating guidelines 
while the rebels remained in the zones 
the sandinistas reportedly want the contras to lay down their 
arms a move the rebels say they will not do 
the delay was necessary because the technical commissions 
still are negotiating verification of the zones and the modus 
operandi of contra fighters inside the zones nicaraguan 
resistance spokesman jorge rosales said in an interview from miami 
calero also charged the sandinistas had violated the agreement 
by not freeing the prisoners they had requested 
they played tricks they released only about 10 of those we 
requested the rest were those held for a few days he said 
the nicaraguan resistance the contra umbrella group also said 
saturday the government has refused to sell necessary printing 
materials to the opposition la prensa newspaper while it 
continues granting all paper and other materials for publication to 
the other newspapers in violation of the pacts condition for 
full press freedom in nicaragua 
under the terms of the ceasefire pact the sandinistas said 
they would release all 3300 political prisoners gradually the 
last coming after the 60day ceasefire period ended june 1 the 
government also pledged full freedom of expression 
the contras pledged to accept only humanitarian aid through a 
neutral organization that clause according to the sandinistas 
means the rebels can receive only civilian clothes food and 
medicine and that it must come through an organization such as the 
red cross

although the roman catholic church has never 
formally accepted the shroud of turin as christs burial cloth it 
has kept it wrapped in red silk inside a silver chest on the altar 
of the cathedral of turin on the chance that indeed it might be 
genuine modern science may be on the verge of an answer 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after centuries of debate scientists in england 
the united states and switzerland may finally determine whether the 
shroud of turin is a medieval forgery or old enough to have existed 
at the time of christs death on the cross 
the vatican for the first time is allowing radiocarbondating 
of the mysterious linen which appears to bear the image of a 
crucified man and is venerated by some as christs burial cloth 
a date from the middle ages will be compelling evidence of what 
skeptics have argued all along that the shroud of turin is a fake 
although no one will ever prove the image is christs a date 
anywhere near 2000 years old could cause a sensation for it would 
indicate the shroud existed when christ was crucified 
i would be rather awed if it looked extremely probable that it 
was his burial cloth said oxford universitys dr robert hedges 
one of the scientists carrying out the tests 
the british museum has agreed to guarantee the scientific 
validity of the carbondating which is to be done independently on 
nuclear atomcounters at oxford the university of arizona and the 
swiss federal institute of technology at the university of zurich 
no timetable has been set but dr michael tite director of the 
museums research laboratory said tests should begin this spring 
and the results announced possibly by the summer 
the triple carbondating should reveal the shrouds age within a 
200year range he said 
if you get a medieval date then clearly it is not the 
shroud tite said in an interview 
if you get a date of the period of christ then it doesnt 
tell you anything except that it tells you it could be the 
genuine thing 
the most extensive investigation was the 1978 shroud of turin 
research project in which dozens of scientists subjected the cloth 
to chemical analysis and took 30000 photographs of it 
they concluded the stains were human blood and the image too 
thin to be an artists work 
the shroud 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide 
bears a faint yellowish image of both the front and back of a mans 
body stains scientifically identified as blood can be seen 
around the wrists forearms and head corresponding to new 
testament descriptions of christs wounds from being whipped 
speared nailed to a cross and crowned with thorns 
believers contend the image was left by a supernatural burst of 
energy accompanying christs resurrection 
skeptics however maintain it was painted during the middle 
ages when the production of fake religious relics was commonplace 
historical records have authoritatively traced the shroud to 
1354 references to the shroud before then are sketchy and 
scientists have long tried to persuade the roman catholic church to 
subject it to carbondating 
the vatican which owns the shroud previously argued that 
carbondating would damage the cherished linen but the development 
of an atomcounter known as an accelerator mass spectrometer in the 
1970s made it possible to date objects with much smaller samples 
the old technique would have required a piece of the shroud the 
size of a paper napkin the spectrometer can use a sample no bigger 
than a postage stamp the vatican refused to say when samples would 
be cut from the shroud which is locked away in the cathedral at 
turin italy scientists doing the tests have been barred from 
witnessing the sampletaking procedure or saying when they received 
their samples 
instead the samplecutting was being videotaped and 
photographed for documentation tite and the archishop of turin 
cardinal anastasio alberto ballestrero were to witness the cutting 
to certify the procedure 
more controversially the vatican announced in january that it 
would allow only three laboratories to take part in the tests 
instead of the seven originally planned 
the decision outraged among others dr robert otlet director 
of one of the rejected labs the british atomic energy authoritys 
isotope measurements laboratory at harwell the lab is a world 
leader in dating archaeological finds 
i think its as much a catastrophe as it would be if you 
allowed bulldozers to go over an archaeological site before youve 
examined it he said in an interview

another test center rejected by the archdiocese of turin was the 
nuclear structure research laboratory at the university of 
rochester in new york state which developed the nuclear carbon 
14dating technique chosen for the tests 
professor harry gove the lab director who spearheaded the 
campaign to carbondate the shroud said in a telephone interview 
that restricting the tests to three labs and thereby eliminating a 
second carbondating technique would make the results a lot less 
believable 
there are a lot of people who think the shroud is a phony so 
if the dating is a number that comes around 2000 years theyre 
going to say theres been some kind of conspiracy he said 
new scientist a british journal accused the vatican of 
revising the testing protocol to produce an ambiguous result that 
would allow people to continue believing in the shroud is a genuine 
relic 
professor luigi gonella scientific adviser to the archdiocese 
of turin said the church never claimed the shroud was authentic 
only that it might be and must be treated with respect and 
caution 
the number of testing labs was restricted to minimize damage to 
the shroud gonella said adding that the archdiocese had never 
agreed to allow more than three labs to participate 
critics talk about us reducing the number of labs from seven 
to three while we see it as increasing it from one to three he 
said in an interview 
the british museums tite said there is no reason to think that 
three labs could not produce a sound result 
it is in fact quite unusual to do two or three measurements on 
a normal archaeological specimen he said one is the normal 
number two youre providing a check and three youre providing a 
doublecheck 
tite said each test lab will receive a 03squareinch sample of 
the shroud they also will get two dummy cloth samples one 
carbondated and the other dated historically but not 
scientifically to see if they get consistent results for all three 
samples 
the labs are not supposed to know which sample is from the 
shroud but tite acknowledged that the linens distinctive 
herringbone weave would probably give it away under the microscope 
hedges head of the radiocarbondating unit at oxfords research 
laboratory for archaeology and the history of art said he would 
not deliberately try to determine which of the three samples is 
from the shroud 
in a sense it almost puts one under too much pressure he 
said in an interview its sort of more relaxed if one doesnt 
really know 
either way he added it wouldnt affect the findings 
hedges said carbondating would establish the time at which the 
flax in the shroud was growing rather than when the cloth was 
made although the two dates presumably are about the same 
asked how confident he was of establishing the shrouds age 
hedges said i wouldnt put my life on it but on the other hand 
id make a pretty hefty bet

the history of the shroud of turin goes back 
only about 800 years when a crusading knight said he saw it in 
constantinople it never has been traced to the holy land 
the roman catholic church does not claim it is jesus burial 
cloth and many critics have dismissed the linen cloth and its 
image as a clever forgery 
perhaps the shrouds earliest known debunker was pierre darcis 
bishop of troyes in a 1389 letter he told clement vii the papal 
claimant in avignon that the bishop who preceeded him in troyes 
knew who painted it 
the church is aware there is a big historical gap and it is 
also aware this historical gap will never be filled 
satisfactorily professor luigi gonella the scientific adviser 
to the archbishop of turin said in a recent telephone interview 
the shroud bequeathed to the pope by exking umberto ii of 
italy upon his death in 1983 has been kept in the cathedral at 
turin since 1578 
through records the shroud can be traced to lirey in france in 
1354 in 1453 the royal family of savoy got the shroud and kept it 
at the castle of chambery where fire damaged it in 1532 
there are references to it as early as the 5th or 6th centuries 
and coincidences have been found between the shroud and 7thcentury 
byzantine art and liturgy 
witnesses including william of tyre in 1171 and robert of clari 
of the fourth crusade in 1203 reported seeing the shroud in the 
imperial palace at constantinople the trail then is lost until the 
shroud appears in france 
gonella said the church doesnt recognize the shroud as a relic 
but as a cherished object that must be given the respect due a 
relic 
the church understands it will never know if it is the actual 
burial cloth of jesus said gonella but it has the probability 
of being the burial cloth of jesus and must be treated with respect 
and caution 
wrapped in red silk under protective glass and an iron grill 
the shroud is kept on an altar in a silver chest that has only 
rarely been opened in the last century 
perhaps the most significant occasion was in 1898 when a man 
named secundo pia was allowed to photograph it 
the result was sensational 
the image on the shroud is similar to a photographic negative 
so the negative on pias photographic plate gave the world its 
first positive image of the man on the shroud 
pias work confounded skeptics why would a medieval forger 
paint a negative image an image that produced a perfect positive 
visible only centuries later when photography was invented

here briefly is how carbondating works 
all living things absorb carbon 14 a radioactive isotope 
created by rays bombarding the earths atmosphere from outer space 
there is a certain proportion of carbon 14 to nonradioactive 
carbon 12 in the air and in living things while plants and animals 
are alive this proportion remains the same when they die they 
stop absorbing carbon 14 
because it is radioactive carbon 14 decays at a known rate it 
takes 5730 years for half the carbon 14 to decay 
carbon 12 does not decay so by measuring the proportion of 
carbon 14 to carbon 12 left in a sample scientists can tell when 
the plant or animal it came from died 
to count carbon atoms a sample must first be converted into 
carbon dioxide this is done by burning 
a technique more advanced from original procedures used in the 
1940s when carbondating was first applied uses a nuclear 
atomcounting machine called an accelerator mass spectrometer 
it propels carbon dioxide through a tube at tremendous speed 
causing the various atomic particles to separate and making it 
possible to detect carbon 12 and carbon 14
