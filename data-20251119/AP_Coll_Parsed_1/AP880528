a 40yearold man pleaded innocent 
friday to a felony childstealing charge after a search turned up a 
teenage boy who had been missing for nearly four years officials 
said 
patrick michael mccleery was arrested wednesday after 
christopher elias 17 was discovered in mccleerys trailer in 
apple valley a town about 85 miles northeast of los angeles

area in lake county about 100 miles north of san francisco

1984 near clear lake where the teenagers father manages a 
marina one day mccleery rented a boat from them and that was 
the last they saw of him or their son sharp said 
the boys mother said the only contact the family had with the 
boy was one telephone call a year in which he would say im 
alive and hang up on wednesday the mother said she received an 
anonymous call from someone who gave her an apple valley phone 
number to reach her son sharp said 
the number was wrong but detectives canvassed telephone 
customers with the same prefix sharp said and the boy was found 
in the camping trailer mccleery used as a home 
mccleery originally was arrested for investigation of 
kidnapping but deputy district attorney gary fagan said 
childstealing was the appropriate charge 
kidnapping involves an element of force while childstealing 
involves enticement and concealment he said a hearing has been 
scheduled for may 31 where mccleery may face additional charges

naval officers would get new power to arrest 
suspected drug smugglers at sea under a nearly 300 billion 
pentagon budget bill approved by the senate 
the bill including controversial provisions giving the military 
new authority to enter the fight against illegal drugs passed the 
senate on friday ending a parliamentary dispute that had delayed 
final action for two weeks 
the approval sends the measure to a housesenate conference 
committee which will begin meeting next month to try to work out 
differences between the house and senate versions of the 
legislation 
the senates antidrug provision includes arrest powers for 
naval officers whose warships stop drug boats in international 
waters the house bill which passed overwhelmingly is more 
farreaching it orders president reagan to have the military 
essentially seal the us borders against drug smugglers 
the senate approved the bill on a voice vote in an almostempty 
chamber late in the afternoon shortly before adjourning for a 
memorial day recess that procedure was unusual there is usually a 
roll call vote on the budget for the federal governments largest 
single agency 
approval came after sen alfonse damato rny withdrew an 
amendment which would have permitted the death penalty to be meted 
out to drug pushers who are convicted of killing persons 
damatos proposal will be considered as a separate piece of 
legislation when the senate returns next month 
originally he had attached his plan as an amendment to the 
pentagon bill because senate opponents had threatened to filibuster 
a freestanding bill his proposal is popular in the senate but 
its filibuster rules are designed to protect the right of the 
minority 
the senate was close to passing the pentagon bill two weeks ago 
but damato refused to drop his amendment he finally gave way 
friday after democratic leaders renewed their argument that lack of 
a defense budget bill would harm us national security 
both house and senate bills authorize 2995 billion in pentagon 
spending the current defense budget is 291 billion the 2995 
billion figure was approved by reagan last december as part of the 
agreement between the white house and congress to reduce federal 
budget deficits 
the bills contain money for a vast array of weapons among those 
in the senate measure are another trident missilefiring submarine 
two more 688class attack subs the first of the new 
seawolfclass of attack subs three destroyers 72 f18 
fighters 36 f15s 180 f16s and 72 apache attack helicopters 
besides the antidrug provisions other differences between the 
two bills include

would be about 41 billion which would be an increase over the 
current sdi budget of 39 billion 
arms control both bills ban any sdi tests that would violate 
the existing narrow interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty but the house measure contains two other 
restrictions including a ban on spending for any weapons that 
violate numerical restrictions on various categories of weapons in 
the unratified 1979 salt ii treaty and a ban on all but the 
smallest tests of us nuclear weapons 
pay raise the senate approved reagans request for a 43 
percent average pay raise for the nations 21 million uniformed 
military personnel while the house voted for a 4 percent increase 
base closings the senate bill creates a 15member pentagon 
commission to study the nations 3600 military installations and 
recommend by dec 31 which ones can be closed no such provision is 
part of the house bill although that chamber is considering the 
baseclosing commission as part of a separate bill

sending any us combat troops to leftistruled nicaragua a ban 
the senate refused to add reagan has repeatedly said the united 
states has no intention of sending combat troops to the central 
american nation 
landbased nuclear missiles reagan sought 793 million for a 
railroadbased version of the mx nuclear missile and 200 million 
for research into the midgetman missile the house approved 100 
million for the mx and 600 million for midgetman while the senate

the united states is working on a new strategy 
for dealing with panama that would involve a foursided effort 
to oust military leader manuel antonio noriega assistant secretary 
of state elliott abrams says 
abrams discussed the proposed effort in a telephone interview 
friday as intense diplomatic contacts continued following the 
collapse on wednesday of direct us negotiations with panama 
one official who asked not to be identified said that some 
members of congress are so eager for a solution in panama that they 
are recommending that the administration authorize noriegas 
assassination 
assassination of foreign leaders is forbidden under a 1981 
executive order 
abrams said the new initiative would involve discussions among 
officials from the united states latin american democracies the 
panamanian government and the opposition 
what many latins have in mind is seeing if they can negotiate 
a complete package deal and seeing if they can get noriega and the 
united states to go along abrams said 
he said noriega would more likely accept a negotiated solution 
if the latin american democracies can work together to isolate him 
diplomatically 
abrams acknowledged the task wont be easy because of the strong 
sentiment in the hemisphere in support of noninterventionism 
weighing against that sentiment he said is the growing support 
in the hemisphere for human rights and democracy and the war on 
drugs 
two federal grand juries in florida indicted noriega in february 
on drug smuggling charges 
abrams said he does not believe that any latin american 
initiative can work unless the united states plays a role as well 
among the countries most receptive to the idea of a latin 
american initiative in panama are guatemala and venezuela he said 
abrams met friday morning with former venezuelan president 
carlos andres perez who is seeking election this year to a new 
term and had expressed interest previously in contributing to a 
settlement in panama 
this is a situation we cannot allow to continue adrift 
perez said 
abrams said guatemalan president vinicio cerezo has offered to 
host talks between noriega and the panamanian opposition with 
guatemalan officials serving as witnesses 
this proposal has been endorsed by ousted panamanian president 
eric arturo delvalle whom the united states continues to recognize 
as the legitimate authority in panama 
while expressing support for a multilateral approach abrams 
said it is essential that diplomatic and economic pressure on 
noriega be maintained as well 
otherwise the negotiations would amount to nothing more than 
sweet talk he said 
as part of the us plan to restore democratic rule in panama 
next year noriega was to step down this august and go into 
temporary exile in return the federal drug smuggling indictments 
were to be dismissed 
but noriega rejected the proposal and the talks were called off 
in a speech friday noriega blamed abrams and us ambassador 
arthur davis for the breakdown in talks but he didnt elaborate on 
the charge earlier he had complained that the united states 
presented him with an ultimatum 
he called for foreign forces to leave panama and for the 
united states to leave panama in peace sirs for gods sake 
leave it in peace 
during a photo session in helsinki on friday with finnish 
president mauno koivisto president reagan said he and his advisers 
have reached no decision about how to proceed on the panamanian 
problem

attorney general edwin meese iii plans to find 
a replacement quickly for a top justice department aide who says 
his departure has nothing to do with meeses legal problems 
charles cooper the assistant attorney general who heads the 
office of legal counsel handed in his resignation friday 
effective july 8 the department fully expects to have a 
replacement for cooper by the time he leaves said department 
spokesman patrick korten 
in terms of staffing the department is in better shape than 
most agencies around town at this point in an administration 
said korten many officials are returning to jobs in the private 
sector as president reagans term comes to an end he said 
there has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections 
of the justice department since the march 29 protest resignations 
of deputy attorney general arnold burns and criminal division chief 
william weld 
five of burns deputies left following his resignation 
virtually emptying the deputys office and two of welds aides 
quit when he did 
earlier this month meese fired his chief spokesman terry 
eastland and the head of meeses speechwriting unit resigned as a 
result 
it took meese until this week to find replacements for the posts 
vacated by burns and weld burns successor utah trial lawyer 
harold christensen will fill the slot on an acting basis pending 
senate confirmation welds replacement edwards sg dennis jr 
the us attorney in philadelphia also will serve on an acting 
basis 
cooper doesnt have a job but wants to work for a private law 
firm he said his decision to leave was not based on the fact that 
independent counsel james c mckay is expected to issue a report in 
several weeks raising questions about meeses ethical conduct 
meanwhile the washington post citing anonymous sources 
reported in todays editions that meese met with vice president 
george bush earlier this month to discuss the political 
ramifications of the attorney generals legal difficulties 
the newspaper said the sources did not reveal what bush said 
during the discussion but said the meeting was requested by meese 
the vice president has said he would not ask meese to resign while 
the mckay probe is in progress but bush aides have said publicly 
that meese is a liability to bushs presidential campaign 
cooper said i have not formed any judgments about meese on 
the matters mckay has been examining meeses involvement with 
scandalplagued wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline 
project 
cooper praised meese as being almost exclusively responsible 
for advancing a number of issues on the reagan administrations 
conservative agenda 
in an interview cooper said he has an extraordinary 
admiration for meeses ability to withstand the controversy 
that prevails at this time in connection with mckays yearold 
criminal investigation of meese and that i have every good 
wish for him in the future 
meese thanked cooper in a letter for his loyalty support and 
special vote of confidence

the organist for the omaha royals hit a sour 
note with an umpire and was ejected from a baseball game for 
playing derogatory music 
lambert bartak who has played for the american association 
minor league team for 15 years was thrown out by an umpire for 
playing the theme song from mickey mouse club during the fifth 
inning thursday night 
he was playing music derogatory to the profession of 
umpiring umpire tony maners said after the game 
bartak disagrees 
all i was doing was playing to fill during a break in the 
action bartak said shortly after terry wendlendt omahas 
assistant general manager told him he had played his last note of 
the evening 
the incident occurred after omaha catcher larry owen questioned 
a call by home plate umpire angel hernandez out came omaha manager 
glenn ezell to join in the discussion 
while owen hernandez ezell and maners debated bartak played 
mickeymouse 
it proved less than a hit with maners chief of the threeman 
umpiring crew 
he had been warned about it during one of our earlier trips 
here maners said 
maners motioned toward the lower press box where the stadium 
organ is located and gave bartak the heaveho however no one 
told bartak hed been ejected 
during a break in the action in the bottom of the fifth bartak 
began playing 
maners stopped play and told omaha officials the umpires would 
leave the field at rosenblatt stadium if bartak hit one more note 
this is a first said bartak who was back at the organ 
friday night 
not for maners who says he ejected another organist when he 
umpired in the international league 
there was one more sour note in the game the royals lost to the 
richmond braves 81

presidential campaign trail 
 
michael dukakis blasting the reagan administration for alleged 
200000 payments by the cia to panamanian gen manuel noriega 
weve been paying that guy what we pay the president of the 
united states you cant be serious about waging a real war against 
drugs when we have an administration that cant say no to noriega 
 
george bush unfazed by his new underdog status as suggested by 
recent polls do i worry about it i dont worry about it i like 
fighting back dukakis is the frontrunner hes been decreed 
that in poll after poll and i like fighting back i remember 
iowa 
 
jesse jackson hearkening back to the beginning of his rainbow 
coalition in his call for people to work together hispanics in 
the barrios blacks in the ghettos ranchers on ranches indians on 
reservations theres a tendency of these people to be 
abandoned by law the real challenge is to begin to pull together 
our various backgrounds and find common ground to turn to each

where killer whales cruise the harbor 
eagles gather by the thousands and moose graze next to main 
street what takes the title of most exotic animal 
no contest its elsie the cow 
the light brown jersey is bringing fame to sue edwards 
fiveacre farm in haines a remote town on the northern end of 
alaskas inside passage where residents say they havent seen a cow 
in close to 30 years 
secondgraders take field trips to see the bovine wonder and her 
two bull calves the summer fair features a contest to guess 
elsies weight 50 cents a chance and her date with an 
outoftown bull made the front page of the local newspaper 
edwards who moved to haines four years ago from an eastern 
oregon cattle ranch says she was dismayed to find the fishing town 
of some 2000 people lacked any livestock aside from a few goats 
so elsie was imported last year from a yukon territory farm a 
few hundred miles away 
i like cows im partial to cows edwards says 
a lot of people drive new cars and live in cathedralstyle 
houses theyre in debt up to their ears but theyre doing what 
they want to do ive got myself a milk cow and im in debt up to 
my ears and im doing what i want to do 
its not easy living in a onecow town 
take hay for starters prime alfalfa hay sells for up to 18 a 
bale on the rare occasions it is shipped to haines so elsie and 
her offspring 15monthold poohdabear and the newborn little ed 
have to settle for inferior hay trucked south from the yukon 
but it costs 4 a bale at least four times more than it would 
in the lower 48 states edwards says 
then there are the local moose who took a keen interest in 
elsie around calving time they didnt hurt the cow or little ed 
born may 6 but struck terror into the heart of sherman the horse 
the horse and the moose have a grudge match edwards says 
the moosell bugle at the horse the horsell start running at 
the end of his rope 
so far the horsemoose match has cost edwards one downed fence 
and several trips to recapture the fleeing sherman 
despite elsies popularity no one else in town has been 
inspired to buy a cow 
theres not a lot of encouragement around theres definitely 
more skepticism edwards says she fits in farming while selling 
gear at the local cannery with help from her husband david a 
logger 
still local folks who take alaskas bald eagles whales and 
other abundant wildlife for granted have come to count on elsie and 
the edwards barnyard antics for entertainment 
it started when elsie was shipped to skagway about an hour 
north by state ferry for a liaison with a bull 
stardom struck on the return trip the cow got rambunctious and 
tore open a sack of grain in the back of edwards pickup truck 
down on the car deck of the ferry 
the pursers call for the cows owner alerted other people to 
the rare beast on board and the ships cook sent down a special 
request for some fresh milk which he said he had never tasted 
the empty pail was presented at the dock elsie by that time 
looking seasick and none too happy nonetheless obliged with a few 
squirts edwards recalls 
by the time the cow disembarked a crowd was waiting people 
were cheering and the editor of the weekly chilkat valley news had 
a camera at hand thats was the beginning of elsies glory 
edwards says

ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
said the united states was tricked into negotiating with gen 
manuel antonio noriega who used the talks to cement his position 
as panamas de facto ruler 
from hiding delvalle also said friday that noriega exploited 
the negotiations on the generals eventual removal from power to 
embarrass the reagan administration 
he said washington erred in not bringing panamas opposition and 
the regions democracies in the talks 
i have always thought that the talks were a ploy to delay 
matters to give noriega time to strengthen his inner circle 
within the panamanian defense forces and at the end yes to 
ridicule president reagan and the united states delvalle said 
i dont think noriega was sincere and i told the reagan 
administration that what happened would happen that wasnt very 
difficult i told them about three weeks ago he said 
secretary of state george p shultz on wednesday announced that 
talks had collapsed and blamed the failure on noriega 
noriega on friday blamed us ambassador arthur davis and the 
state departments elliott abrams for the breakdown 
delvalle spoke with several correspondents friday at a location 
the reporters agreed not to identify he was ousted by noriega on 
feb 26 one day after he tried to fire the general who heads the 
nations 15000strong defense forces and is the power behind the 
panamanian presidency 
the united states continues to recognize delvalle as panamas 
legitimate president 
noriega was indicted in the united states in february on drug 
trafficking charges which he denies 
i am disappointed at the fact that they did not use to their 
advantage our knowledge of noriega delvalle said criticizing 
the united states for attempting to remove noriega without help 
from other latin american countries 
he suggested the united states permit latin american democracies 
to take the lead in mediating the crisis a move the reagan 
administration is exploring 
asked if there were circumstances under which he might renounce 
his claim to the presidency delvalle responded why should i 
this is one of the basic factors respect for the constitution by 
the military 
all over latin american there has been a clear loud message 
that the military is below civilian government he said 
delvalle warned of a rising threat of street violence if noriega 
remains and the economic crisis prompted in part by us 
sanctions continues millions of dollars in panamanian assets are 
frozen in american banks 
i think we will be facing violence in the near future 
delvalle said the people of panama are getting desperate we 
will see some violent demonstrations here in the next few days or 
weeks 
in a speech to a womens convention friday noriega said he held 
the reagan administration responsible for his personal safety 
i place responsibility for the life of manuel antonio noriega 
with the establishment of the united states i hold the 
establishment responsible for the life of this son of god 
noriega said 
the general did not elaborate on his charges that davis and 
abrams were responsible for the collapse of the talks 
but he called for foreign forces to leave panama and for the 
united states to leave panama in peace sirs for gods sake 
leave it in peace 
the united states normally maintains about 10000 troops in 
panama but sent in an additional 2000 soldiers since the crisis 
over noriega intensified this year 
panamas foreign minister jorge eduardo ritter said friday 
that panamas relations with the united states were practically 
nonexistent 
he said relations were bad because the united states maintains 
recognition of a government that doesnt exist referring to 
washingtons continued endorsement of delvalle as president

arun gandhi says civil rights laws are a 
big stick but one that has failed to beat racism out of the social 
fabric of the south 
instead he is using a soft voice like the one his grandfather 
mohandas k mahatma gandhi used three generations ago to help 
free india from british rule 
gandhi a 53yearold freelance journalist is living in 
mississippi to conduct research for a book and hopefully rejuvenate 
what he calls a stalled civil rights movement 
gandhis only weapon is his almostwhisper and a long list of 
speaking engagements during which he promotes the selfhelp 
programs he once employed to aid indias poor gandhi says he never 
points fingers only talks and offers suggestions 
we have enough hatred in this world and we dont want to add 
to it he says 
so far the quiet presentations by gandhi and his wife sunanda 
gandhi have caught the ear of dozens of political religious and 
business leaders the gandhis have been crisscrossing the state 
since their arrival from bombay last august 
i think the name opens some doors and gives them some 
opportunity for dialogue that may not be open to someone else 
says state rep leslie king of greenville head of the mississippi 
legislatures black caucus 
black and white mississippians now dine together ride the bus 
together vote together and go to school and work together but 
they dont socialize together gandhi said in an interview 
there is no real acceptance there is just toleration he 
said 
gandhi plans to live in mississippi a year gathering material 
for his book which will compare the treatment of blacks in the 
south with the treatment of the untouchables in indias 
maharashtra state his home for the past 30 years 
although indian laws have banned the old caste system which 
relegated the untouchables to the bottom of the social strata he 
said discrimination remains just as it does for blacks in the 
united states 
in both cases we have legally solved the problem but not 
socially gandhi said if we dont do it at an individual 
level it will never happen the government cant do it 
but gandhi isnt ignoring the government in his crusade to 
improve the lot of mississippis blacks 
gov ray mabus plans to study gandhis proposal for cooperative 
industries to be owned by poor mississippians mabus spokesman 
kevin vandenbroek said 
he felt that they were good ones vandenbroek said of mabus 
reaction to gandhis suggestions during an hourlong meeting in 
january 
instead of government welfare and private charity gandhi said 
mississippis poor who are primarily black need their own 
businesses 
in 1962 gandhi and a few friends established a trust that 
loaned money to 250 poor indian farmworker families to establish 
their own agricultural and dairy cooperative 
within six years gandhi said the cooperative produced crops 
worth 130000 annually that allowed it to pay the workers more 
than double the minimum wage prescribed by indian law 
gandhi believes adaptations of his indian programs could help 
the poor here and he says mississippians particularly religious 
leaders are best able to erase racial inequity 
theres been more discussion in the religious community about 
reaching out to the poor including blacks since the gandhis began 
visiting congregations said chaplain hal hutchison of the 
university of mississippis episcopal ministry 
i dont think that they could prescribe for mississippi a 
remedy for economic and employment problems hutchison said 
but i think some of the things they say can prompt us to 
reevaluate how were going about things

economists for the nations top businesses 
expect high interest rates to push the country into recession 
sometime next year despite their revised forecasts for stronger 
growth in 1988 
the survey found that a majority of the economists 578 
percent believed the lengthy american economic expansion now in 
its sixth year will end with a recession in 1989 
at the same time the survey by the national association of 
business economists released friday showed a substantial boost in 
growth estimates for this year compared with a survey done three 
months ago 
however the economists expressed concerns the rapid growth in 
foreign demand for us goods coupled with continued high consumer 
spending in this country would contribute to inflationary 
pressures and prompt the federal reserve to step in with higher 
interest rates to cool off the economy

former president nixon says a proposed fifth

administration to complete an arms control agreement in the 
national interest 
president reagan quoted by the german newspaper die welt held 
out the possibility of another summit before he departed wednesday

but nixon wrote in a column for this weekends editions of the 
sunday times of london once the two major parties choose their 
tickets for the general election an incumbents authority in 
soviet eyes drops to nil he said 
any summit after the two conventions will be meaningless 
unless both the republican and democratic nominees agreed to

rebel leaders agreed friday to discuss 
a truce extension proposed by the leftist government and one of the 
bestknown rebel commanders turned himself in to accept government 
amnesty 
manuel espinoza the presidential spokesman said some 
advances had been made during the second day of the peace talks 
the government proposed extending the talks beyond their 
scheduled end on saturday but contra leaders rejected the 
suggestion saying an agreement could be reached if the government 
truly desires one 
alfredo cesar head of the rebel delegation said we cannot 
stay here longer adding that if there is political will on the 
part of the sandinistas an agreement can be signed on saturday 
felix garcia hernandez known as alfa lima told reporters 
friday that before he asked for amnesty he commanded more than 400 
contras in the chontales region 
he said he met with representatives of the nicaraguan army 
several times during the truce and decided to return because of his 
family and because he felt nicaraguans should stop killing each 
other he turned himself in wednesday and the sandinista government 
announced it thursday night 
alfa lima abandoned the rebel force with six of his men and said 
friday he hoped to encourage more of his former comrades to take 
advantage of the amnesty 
i am going to try to convince my men to come in there are 
many out there who do not know what they are doing or why they are 
fighting said the softspoken alfa lima still wearing his 
camouflage uniform 
alfa limas former commanderinchief enrique bermudez was in 
managua for the peace talks and said upon hearing of his decision 
we regret it he was a field commander with a long record we 
consider him a war casualty 
although they agreed to discuss extending the ceasefire which 
is scheduled to end may 30 the rebels still insist on an agreement 
that includes a firm schedule of democratic reforms 
according to a source at the negotiating table defense minister 
gen humberto ortega head of the government delegation told the 
session it would be difficult to reach an agreement by saturday 
noon but we are not discarding the possibility of a miracle like 
the miracle at sapoa 
sapoa a town on the costa rican border was where the march 23 
peace agreement was signed by the sandinista government and the 
ussupported rebels 
cesar said there was a 25 percent chance of an agreement 
rebel spokesman bosco matamoros said after fridays session that 
some political topics had been discussed but added the two 
sides still differed on fundamental political issues 
we have different concepts of democracy different concepts of 
human rights the role of the state in a society and the structure 
of a judiciary system he said 
president daniel ortegas government feels a permanent 
ceasefire is a necessary first step toward peace the contras want 
political reforms that would enlarge the oppositions role in a 
more pluralistic and democratic society 
on thursday the rebel delegates declared they had come to 
managua only to discuss their own plan which sets deadlines for 
government introduction of reforms the sandinistas called the 
contra proposals unrealistic but agreed to put them on the 
table 
government negotiators then offered a plan for electoral reforms 
and a ceasefire as a continuation of general agreements reached at 
sapoa for a truce amnesty a government dialogue with the 
political opposition and eventual integration into the political 
life of the rebels and their leaders 
the important thing is not to disappoint the expectations of 
the people of nicaragua said bayardo arce vice coordinator of 
the political committee of the sandinista national liberation 
front known by its spanish initials fsln 
luis rivas leiva adviser to the contra delegation said we 
are paying a high price in the negotiations the fsln does not want 
to pay any they are being very inflexible 
at the heart of the disagreement are the definition of 
democratization and how to go about it 
within five days of an agreement the contras demand an end to 
the military draft freedom to supply their forces in the field and 
total press freedom including establishment of private radio and 
television stations 
within two months they want measures to guarantee political 
pluralism separation of state powers curtailment of the powers of 
the fsln guarantees of the right to strike and reforms in the 
judiciary and the electoral system 
the government has offered to discuss electoral reforms and 
announed an amnesty program and a plan for municipal elections 
they have been doing some things but those are more form than 
substance rivas leiva said there are some important matters 
that involve guarantees for the return of all our people to the 
political life of nicaragua 
they want a permanent ceasefire we want at the same time a 
political process that would democratize nicaragua he said 
cesar is a former sandinista financial expert bermudez the 
contras military commander was once a colonel in the army of the 
late president anastasio somoza whom the sandinistas overthrew in 
july 1979

democrat michael dukakis is blasting the reagan administration 
for failing to say no to panamanian leader manuel noriega 
republican george bush after sniffing the maine air 
declaredim the underdog and i like it 
dukakis the frontrunner in the race for the democratic 
presidential nomination ridiculed the administration over reports 
emerging in congressional hearings that the cia allegedly made 
200000 payments to the military leader who has been indicted in 
us courts on drug charges 
campaigning friday in albuquerque nm dukakis called on 
president reagan bush or someone in this administration to 
provide an explanation of the cias alleged link to the panamanian 
weve been paying the guy what we pay the president of the 
united states dukakis said you cant be serious about waging 
a real war against drugs when you have an administration that cant 
say no to noriega 
bush who is spending the week of the ussoviet summit meeting 
at his vacation retreat in kennebunkport maine urged new 
negotiations to persuade noriega to leave panama even though he 
earlier opposed those talks 
he denounced as an outrageous lie what he said was a 
reported suggestion that the administration held the talks to help 
his campaign 
i dont like it being injected by michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson either if they have some proof or they have something 
other than insinuation let them speak out he said at a news 
conference friday on the lawn of his family home 
bush who is meeting over the next week with advisers and 
prominent republicans in an effort to renew his campaign said he 
wasnt worried about polls showing him running behind dukakis 
im the underdog and i like it he said it is may and the 
election is in november do i worry about it i dont worry about 
it i like fighting back i remember iowa 
he was referring to his loss to sen bob dole rkan in the 
republican primary in iowa which bush followed with a victory in 
new hampshire 
the latest abc newswashington post poll said dukakis was 
leading bush by a 5340 percent margin among registered voters 
with the atlantic surf pounding in the background bush told 
reporters its the maine air when i get up here i feel its 
not feistiness but i feel very relaxed i dont feel troubled by 
somebody pointing out that im behind in the polls

willie b stepped out of his cage and into a love 
triangle gorilla style 
the atlanta zoos famous lowland gorilla was allowed outdoors 
with other apes for the first time friday as he ventured into his 
new tropical rain forest habitat he tried to get his first good 
look at three female gorillas who will share the artificial 
environment with him though separated by a moat 
things were smooth until rann the 25yearold male silverback 
who lives with the females and fathered five of their six 
offspring realized his harem was eyeing willie with more than mild 
curiosity 
life in the rain forest got hot 
willie b ended 27 years of life in a cage two weeks ago with 
tentative steps into his new outdoor home but when he made his 
first fullfledged foray friday rann wasnt about to let the naive 
gorilla near his mates 
he just knows there is another male on the scene and hes 
trying to protect his females said frederick king director of 
emory universitys yerkes primate research center which loaned 
rann and his family to the zoo 
rann is confused theres another male gorilla and the 
females are interested in him king said rann wants to keep 
em to himself hes seen him and smelled him but he doesnt know 
that willie cant get to the ladies 
rann spent most of the day watching for willie b to appear 
across the moat he plopped onto the ground and munched tomatoes 
tossed out by trainers as a lure 
when willie b drifted into his line of vision and perched under 
a magnolia tree rann hopped up and chased the female gorillas 
inside willie b responded by slamming his cage door as he drifted 
in and out 
the ritual got violent when shamba the dominant female in 
ranns harem trotted out in mild flirtation to get a look at 
willie b her advances prompted a jealous rann to shove her back 
inside and later to smack her on the head 
rann wouldnt even allow the females to wander out and gather 
the fruit and other goodies that trainers offered preferring to 
gobble the foodstuffs himself while he preened for photographers 
king said ranns jealousy may keep him from becoming friends 
with willie b who is named for the late atlanta mayor william b 
hartsfield 
willie bs shift to outdoor life after more than two decades as 
a loner would have been eased by placing him with a female who 
could have shown him the things he would need to know about 
socializing he said 
two other ape families from yerkes will join the gorillas in the 
rain forest which opens to the public june 11 king said none of 
the yerkes animals will be housed with willie but zoo officials 
say they are considering whether to bring in a female roommate for 
him 
the outdoor habitat is a major step forward for zoo atlanta 
which the humane society declared one of the nations worst zoos 
four years ago zoo atlanta officials say the new exhibit built 
with a 1 million grant from ford motor co is the most advanced 
gorilla habitat at any zoo

latin america with a new 
tradition of democracy and an old wariness of the united states 
is in a tricky position when it comes to panama and its military 
boss gen manuel antonio noriega 
on one hand the democracies of south and central american have 
expressed little support for noriega they consider him a throwback 
to an earlier era when military men called the shots in 
thinlydisguised dictatorships 
on the other hand these nations frown on overt attempts by the 
united states to dictate who should run a country and how he should 
do it 
their experience with washingtons alleged highhandedness goes 
back decades and is not easily forgotten 
it is little wonder therefore that their reaction to the 
breakdown of uspanamanian talks aimed at noriegas removal has 
been cautious and wavering 
the talks involved an offer from the united states to drop 
drugtrafficking charges against noriega in exchange for his 
removal as panamas leader 
washingtons two rivals in the region cuba and nicaragua have 
expressed strong support for noriega in his confrontation with the 
united states they have presented the conflict as a classic 
example of a small but proud country valiantly standing up to 
yankee imperialism 
most latin american democracies criticize noriega but stress 
that panamas people and not washington should decide who should 
lead that strategic country 
on thursday colombian foreign minister julio londono paredes 
summed up their feelings best 
the panamanian problem must be resolved by panamanians 
themselves he said without foreign interference and with the 
objective of reestablishing democracy in panama 
and guatemalan president vinicio cerezo may have offered both 
the united states and panama a way out 
cerezo said he is willing to mediate a plan aimed at finding a 
space for dialogue in panama in order to consolidate a 
democratizing process 
cerezo said early this month that panama had reacted favorably 
to his offer and that he would pursue the idea with representatives 
of the panamanian opposition and with other central american 
leaders 
we believe panama is drifting toward confrontation and 
violence toward radicalization against the united states which is 
dangerous for the region and is also causing great damage to 
panama he told journalists thursday night 
in venezuela a foreign ministry official was quoted friday in 
caracas el universal as echoing cerezos perspective 
venezuela he said would seek democracy in panama but 
without the open intervention of other governments trying to 
dictate to panama how it should act 
oscar arias president of costa rica and winner of last years 
nobel peace prize has come out against the reagan administrations 
economic sanctions against panama arias the main author of a 
central american peace plan signed last august contends the 
sanctions have unjustly hurt the average panamanian 
he was involved in late march in a panamanian mediation attempt 
that also included spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez 
the proposal included a major role for the panamanian roman 
catholic church but the initiative did not prosper 
mexico has continued to provide panama with oil under the san 
jose pact which serves small nations of the caribbean and central 
america 
an editorial in mexico citys daily el universal said 
circumstances warranted a respectful participation of others on 
the continent on behalf of the real and transcendent interests of a 
small country that is suffering the effects of a strongmanism 
fostered by the white house

detroit remains a mans world with women making 
up less than 2 percent of top executives in the auto industry 
according to the 1988 whos who guide to car companies 
but in the ranks beneath the graying corporate upper crust more 
and more women are following paths that will lead them to the 
industrys executive suites and boardrooms analysts say 
of the 966 top executives in the auto industry and supplier 
companies listed in a directory published this week 16 were women 
the annual whos who in the automobile industry included in the 
market data book published by the trade journal automotive news 
includes top executives and some lowerlevel primarily marketing 
executives 
this years version current as of april shows general motors 
corp with nine female executives ford motor co with two and 
chrysler corp with none the five other women on the list worked 
for companies related to the auto industry 
most of the people in that list are relatively senior said 
david cole director of the university of michigans office for the 
study of automotive transportation in ann arbor 
in the next five years i would expect to see a significant 
acceleration in female involvement as more women work their way 
up through the product or manufacturing function and arrive at the 
executive level cole said friday 
in 1987 the list contained 986 names including 12 women or 
about 12 percent women made up 17 percent of the listed 
executives in 1988 
thats actually a great stride for us its been a long time 
for us its certainly been a mans domain for many years said 
jeanne beyer vice president for market research and planning at 
global motors inc and one of the women on the 1988 list 
cole and beyer say women are not yet well represented in the 
upper ranks because it was only recently that they began choosing 
careers that would involve them in the auto industry 
its only in the last 10 or 15 years that we are starting to 
see significant female involvement in our engineering program 
today it is 25 percent cole said 
women now working their way up as engineers designers plant 
managers or financial experts are part of the corporate mainstream 
that produces top executives from inside the companies cole said 
by contrast most of the women already in the top ranks at gm 
and ford came from the outside cole said 
once women are on a career track it takes 1520 years to reach 
the main executive ranks from which top corporate officers are 
selected cole said 
now that women have pursued those careers the recognition and 
opportunity is coming but its no faster for women than it is for 
men beyer agreed 
in 1987 women accounted for 189 percent of gms total work 
force of 451571 and 108 percent of all corporate officials and 
managers at ford women made up 152 percent of the 180000member 
work force and 5 percent of the managerial and executive ranks 
chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart said chryslers 1987 equal 
employment opportunity figures had not been compiled but she 
offered 1986 figures women comprised 136 percent of the 
87987worker total and 42 percent of the managers and executives 
once enough women are far enough along in the corporate 
pipeline cole said he expects they will begin to be 
overrepresented in top executive positions 
they have tremendous ambition but also great interpersonal 
skills he said it is necessary to have real ability to work 
with people in a very teamtype setting that is becoming the norm 
in the auto industry

more than 40 years ago a ukrainian 
farmer risked his life to hide a jewish family from nazi soldiers 
now that family who lives in new jersey plans to thank him in 
person 
five members of the zeiger family originally of the ukraine 
left friday for the soviet union to visit antosh suchinsky who 
still lives on the farm where the family hid beneath a barn for two 
years 
the trip comes during the superpower summit in moscow but the 
reunion is purely a private affair said michael zeiger who was 8 
years old when he went into hiding 
this is only for us but there is a bigger message he said 
if you dont watch out what happened then could happen now i 
will never forget it and i hope nobody else does 
for two terrifying years zeiger his mother father brother 
and two children whose parents were captured by the nazis lived in 
a 4footdeep hole under suchinskys barn afraid to even light a 
candle zeigers father told stories to keep the children occupied 
the quarters were so cramped the adults could not stand 
i cant tell you how horrible the conditions were there was 
no air no food no light we were just like animals said 
zeiger now a 55yearold randolph resident and the president of a 
wine importing business all we had was the will to survive a 
positive attitude that eventually we would get out 
suchinskys farm was near the zeiger vacation home before the 
war zeigers mother sonya had befriended the poor farmer who 
appeared odd to many local residents he used to meditate and was 
known to talk to his animals and plants 
my mother always liked him zeiger said she talked to him 
and treated him with respect she gave him clothes and food and he 
never forgot it 
at great risk to himself suchinsky helped hide the family he 
begged and stole to get the family food which he lowered to them 
in a bucket 
you have no idea how he was risking his life zeiger said 
if they ever found out he was hiding somebody or had anything to 
do with it they would have shot him right there on the spot 
near the end of the war suchinsky and other nearby residents 
were forced out by the nazis for two days german soldiers stayed 
in the barn just above the familys hiding place soldiers poked 
bayonets in the straw opening but never discovered the family 
the family finally left their hiding place in the summer of 
1944 when the russians liberated the ukraine their home 
destroyed they immigrated to the united states in 1950 
over the years the zeigers kept in touch with suchinsky through 
letters written by friends of the farmer who couldnt read or 
write they sent him food and clothing but never returned to see 
him in recent years they lost contact and thought he had died 
but zeigers brother shelly discovered on a recent business 
trip to europe that suchinsky was still alive arrangements were 
quickly made for the reunion with the farmer now 83 
im very happy and excited but also a little sad zeiger 
said this trip has awakened a lot of dormant feelings that have 
been forgotten for 40 years it should be a very emotional 
experience

chinas anticorruption ministry has been 
authorized to set up bureaus inside most other ministries and 
departments to better observe alleged wrongdoing an official 
report said today 
the only offices the ministry of supervision will not be allowed 
to invade are those of the defense ministry and the state 
commission for restructuring the economy the xinhua news agency 
said 
the defense ministry presumably was excluded for reasons of 
security but the report did not say why the economic commission 
was exempted 
the ministry of supervision was set up in december 1986 with a 
mandate to sniff out cases of corruption and excessive 
bureaucratism at all levels of government 
it has a total of 15000 employees with offices in most of 
chinas cities and counties xinhua said 
nonetheless cases of corruption have continued to climb and 
this weeks outlook weekly magazine announced the communist party 
was launching a new fullscale fight against corruption in its 
ranks 
it said the campaign would be longterm and wrongdoers would be 
punished but did not give specifics 
cases of corruption appear frequently in the official press on 
all scales earlier this year the peoples daily reported that 52 
million allocated by the government for aiding povertrystricken 
areas was misspent by local officials on such things as tape 
recorders and cars 
cases of local officials eating and drinking extravagantly on 
the government tab and party leaders pocketing party dues also have 
been reported in recent weeks 
corruption has burgeoned in part because opportunities have 
grown under senior leader deng xiaopings 10yearold program to 
revitalize the economy lowerlevel governments and stateowned 
factories have been given greater autonomy in financial matters 
at the same time chinas general rise in prosperity has raised 
the revenues of these governments and factories increasing the 
temptation to wouldbe embezzlers

china today dismissed as deceptive vietnams 
promise to withdraw 50000 of its troops from cambodia this year 
and put the rest under the command of the vietnameseinstalled 
cambodian government 
the foreign ministry statement came two days after the 
vietnamese government announced its withdrawal plan vietnam 
invaded cambodia in 1978 and has battled chinesebacked guerrillas 
ever since 
despite vietnams repeated announcement of partial troop 
withdrawals from kampuchea cambodia up to now there has been no 
sign of reduction of vietnamese aggressor troops the foreign 
ministry said one may suspect whether the same old trick is 
being played once again 
vietnam says it has made annual troop withdrawals since 1982 
but the united states says the only genuine one was made last 
november when 20000 troops left cambodia 
american officials say the other troop movements were only 
rotations 
the united states estimates there are still 120000 to 125000 
vietnamese troops in cambodia 
hanoi said it will pull out 50000 soldiers from june to 
december and put its remaining troops under the command of the 
vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia as part of its plan to 
pull out completely by 1990 
however china said it is entirely deceptive talk for the 
vietnamese side to state that it will further withdraw its troops 
china was a supporter of cambodias khmer rouge regime that 
vietnam ousted in 1978 and has since been the most vociferous 
opponent of vietnams presence in cambodia 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 until the vietnamese 
invasion during that time it killed millions of cambodians as it 
pursued its policy of radical agrarian communism 
china now supports a threeparty resistance coalition headed by 
prince norodom sihanouk who was ousted as ruler of cambodia in a 
1970 military coup 
the coalition made up of three guerilla groups including the 
khmer rouge is recognized by the united nations as the legitimate 
government of cambodia and receives arms and financial support from 
china 
china reiterated today that the only way to resolve the 
cambodian question is for vietnam to completely withdraw its troops 
and take part in negotiations to establish an independent cambodian 
government 
vietnam has said it is an outsider and has no place in 
negotiations on cambodia 
it will lead nowhere for vietnam to disguise itself as an 
outsider chinas statement said 
china has made vietnams withdrawal from cambodia a condition in 
normalizing relations with the soviet union it claims vietnam 
would not be able to maintain its occupation without the kremlims 
support 
china and the soviet union split over ideological and strategic 
differences in the 1960s but relations have improved in recent 
years

a lumber company has agreed to stop 
clearcutting ancient redwood stands but the decision drew mixed 
reviews from environmentalists and politicians 
a state senator attacked both pacific lumber co and 
environmentalists and called the announcement nothing but window 
dressing and a diversionary tactic 
but two other legislators including state assemblyman dan 
hause who negotiated with pacific lumber called the agreement an 
important breakthrough 
the company is the largest private owner of virgin redwood 
left in the world which is why its return to selective logging 
practices is so important said assemblyman byron sher assembly 
natural resources committee chairman 
apparently bowing to protests by environmentalists pacific 
lumber located in scotia announced thursday that it has reversed 
its 2yearold policy of clearcutting the companys 16000 acres 
of virgin redwoods in humboldt county 
the company will return to selective logging in virgin forests 
and also agreed to consider selling some of the oldgrowth stands 
to public interest groups 
john campbell executive vice president of pacific lumber said 
the company agreed to stop clearcutting removing all trees from 
an area its oldest trees because of its sensitivity to 
environmental and legislative concerns 
as the agreement was announced three protesters with the 
radical environmental group earth first were in their sixth day of 
living on makeshift platforms high in redwood trees on the 
companys land the group is attempting to block construction of a 
road through an area of virgin redwoods set for clearing 
pacific lumber was purchased in 1985 by corporate raider charles 
hurwitz head of the maxxam group 
state senate majority leader barry keene who has represented 
the north coast timber region for 16 years called the compromise 
only a diversion 
he called it a cosmetic truce between a company whose recent 
practices can by only described as rapacious and an urban 
environmentalist whose knowledge of silviculture is limited to 
sierra club bulletins 
he also complained that the agreement does not include any offer 
from maxxam to restructure the companys 600 million takeover debt 
or to guarantee jobs and sustained timber production into the 
future 
even before the agreement the state department of forestry had 
stopped pacific lumber from most oldgrowth cutting 
earth first spokesman darryl cherney called the agreement a 
slick public relations ploy the agreement affects only about 
16000 acres of pacific lumbers 200000acre holdings he said 
and its not even a binding agreement he said the 
company had a legislative and bureaucratic gun to its head so 
theyre willing to say anything cherney said

the doublebreasted black and gray pinstripe 
suit rusty fuller picked to wear for his high school graduation 
might not be in the height of fashion now but the suit is a family 
tradition for graduation 
fuller graduated friday night in the same suit his brother 
father and uncle wore during high school graduations dating back to 
1938 
fuller said he felt obligated and honored to wear the suit 
because he shares middle names with his uncle virgil who died in 
germany during world war ii 
virgil fuller was the first to wear the suit at graduation 
from barnard high school in barnard mo in 1938 then fullers 
father cleo wore the suit at his barnard high school graduation 
in 1949 
fullers older brother randy wore the suit at graduation in 
enid 14 years ago 
will the tradition continue 
fuller doesnt think so he says the suit that still looks new 
after 50 years probably will be retired now 
fifty is a good number to quit at he said 
but his father may have a few other ideas 
weve got some grandsons the elder fuller said you never 
know

a man who said he was sleepwalking when he drove 
14 miles to his motherinlaws house and killed her was found 
innocent of murder charges 
kenneth parks 24 was acquitted by an ontario supreme court 
jury of killing barbara woods 42 
parks is still charged with the attempted murder of his 
fatherinlaw denis woods and remained in custody today 
prosecutors said parks defense was ludicrous 
parks of pickering ontario was charged with seconddegree 
murder in the beating and stabbing death of his motherinlaw 
mrs woods was struck with a tire iron and stabbed four times 
and died in bed in her suburban scarborough home on may 24 1987 
her husband who was choked and stabbed recovered from his wounds 
and testified that he never saw his assailant 
defense attorney marlys edwardh said that on the night of the 
killing parks plunged into a deep deep sleep his next memory 
is seeing his motherinlaws face 
the attorney said he then regained consciousness fled the house 
and drove to a nearby police station 
staff sgt bob adair of the toronto police homicide squad 
testified parks said he had no idea how he got to his inlaws home 
and told officers he had no reason to harm them 
testimony indicated parks married to the woods daughter 
karen was under pressure from gambling debts 
ms edwardh said psychiatric evidence indicated that parks was 
sleepwalking at the time of the killing 
she said parks had a history of sleepwalking and asked the jury 
to acquit him because he was in a sleepstate in which there 
is no will or conscious mind directing the activity 
the jury did so thursday after nine hours of deliberation 
according to testimony there are about 35 documented cases 
worldwide of homicides committed during sleepwalking 
crown attorney cathy mocha argued parks must have known what he 
was doing but may have blocked the very terrible events from 
his mind

the homeless here and thanked worshipers at a service for their 
help in supporting her missionary sisters of charity homes 
i want to thank you for sharing the joy of love with our 
sisters and for doing something beautiful for god she said 
friday well be judged by god by how we help our fellow man 
mother teresa who opened a new mission south of the city and 
visited her sisters who work in the area has been dubbed saint 
of the gutters because of her work with the destitute and the 
dying in the slums of india and around the world 
her missionary sisters of charity operate more than 30 homes for 
the hungry diseased orphaned and homeless in 80 countries 
mother teresa said winning the nobel peace prize helped bring 
recognition to her work causing people to talk directly to the 
poor rather than talking about them 
she declined to make a comparison between poverty in other 
countries and among indians which make up a large portion of the 
population in the gallup area 
we help the poorest of the poor and we do not make comparisons 
of the poor anywhere we go she said 
she also spoke against abortion during her 15minute talk to 
about 1000 people who jammed the cathedral 
every woman who gets an abortion never forgets how it was her 
own child and that abortion is the great destroyer of love she 
said

shortly after peterson joined the faculty 
we hear kids talk about divorce and bad relationships and we 
wanted to show them how a good relationship develops over time

first told them the wedding would be at school and during school 
hours 
the kids have been in on this relationship since day one

475pupil school near the indiana border with pink green blue and 
yellow streamers paper flowers wedding bells and congratulatory 
signs 
some of the students took credit for the marriage the first for 
both the bride and groom 
we told him how to ask her out he was too scared said 
richard potts 11 one of petersons students 
while most of the firstgraders were as bubbly about the wedding 
as their older counterparts 7yearold raymond whitehead scoffed 
at all the fuss 
this is mushy he said but he added ill bet the cake 
will be good 
while other classes remained in session during the 2 pm 
ceremony when school let out about 300 students lined the walkway 
outside the building 
as the couple walked down the path the children cheered as the

three reporters from radio free 
europeradio liberty have been denied permission to cover the 
superpower summit in moscow the stations said 
all three had been granted soviet visas radio free europe said 
friday 
bill mahoney spokesman for the two sister stations based in 
munich said the stations have asked the state department to 
protest the decision 
the stations are privatelyoperated entities which broadcast 
news and music to the soviet bloc they are largely funded by the 
us government 
the reporters are wayne brown tom bodin and elizabeth teague 
bodin is an american and ms teague is from britain the 
citizenship of brown could not be immediately learned 
brown was already in moscow when he was told he would not be 
accredited and that he shouldnt even have a visa mahoney told 
the associated press 
bodin and ms teague were about to leave for moscow when they 
were told their visas had been revoked mahoney said 
this casts grave doubts on the sincerity of soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs policy of glasnost said the stations 
president gene pell in washington glasnost evidently does not 
permit representatives of the largest western broadcaster to 
eastern europe and the soviet union to provide a firsthand account 
of the summit to millions of listeners 
the two stations broadcast in 23 languages to eastern europe and 
the soviet union 
malcolm e forbes jr chairman of the board of international 
broadcasting called on gorbachev to reverse the decision the 
washingtonbased board oversees the radio stations 
president reagan is scheduled to arrive in moscow sunday for his 
fourth summit with gorbachev since 1985

former miss america bess myerson was 
distracted when she left a department store with 44 worth of 
unpurchased items resulting in her arrest on shoplifting charges 
her attorney says 
miss myerson who was arrested and charged with shoplifting on 
friday said she left hills department store with the nail polish 
earrings and other items because she realized she had left her car 
unlocked 
she has been distracted by the pressure of recent 
circumstances said miss myersons attorney frederick a hafetz 
he declined to explain what those circumstances were 
miss myerson the former cultural affairs commissioner in new 
york city is scheduled to go on trial in september on charges that 
she tried to influence the judge hearing the divorce case of her 
reported lover carl a capasso 
capasso who along with miss myerson was indicted by a grand 
jury in october is serving a sentence for tax evasion at nearby 
allenwood state prison camp 
miss myerson 63 of new york city appeared before district 
justice john m mcdermott and was released on 150 cash bail in 
accordance with state law she was fingerprinted and photographed 
said south williamsport police chief charles smith 
she denied police allegations that she tried to leave the 
department store without buying six bottles of nail polish five 
pairs of earrings shoes and flashlight batteries stuffed in her 
purse and shopping bag 
i was leaving the store to lock my car and come back and pay 
for the merchandise she told the magistrate 
miss myerson said she would not return for a june 27 hearing and 
would pay her fine and costs under protest through the mail if 
court documents affirm her contention that this is her first such 
arrest the maximum penalty according to the court would be a 
300 fine 
if true its extraordinarily sad that this could have 
occurred new york city mayor edward i koch said of the charge 
miss myerson was his campaign manager in 1977 when koch was first 
elected mayor 
earlier this month the new york daily news citing unidentified 
sources and records said miss myerson was charged in 1970 with 
shoplifting from a london department store and settled the case by 
paying a fine of no more than 100 in 1987

police stood by peacefully as about 
2000 people protested a danube river power project a sign of 
communist authorities increasing tolerance of dissent that does 
not challenge them directly 
a participant in fridays demonstration said police refrained 
from interfering and even cleared the way for marchers as they 
wound their way through downtown budapest to the austrian embassy 
the project in nagymaros hungary is being financed largely by 
austria 
the marcher who spoke on condition of anonymity called it an 
unusual sign of police cooperation with the young members of the 
unofficial danube circle ecological group 
staterun television also took the unusual step of running 
without comment a oneminute film segment on its main evening 
newscast showing protesters arriving at the embassy 
among them was biologist janos varga a leader of the ecologists 
the marchers carried placards and banners demanding a halt to 
the project a joint venture involving hydropower installations on 
the danube at gabcikovo in czechoslovakia and at nagymaros 
banners read we want clear water no dams and we want 
our danube 
hungarian and austrian ecologists have said that damming the 
danube and slowing its flow will threaten drinking water reserves 
of millions of hungarians and destroy large areas of riverside 
forestland in both hungary and czechsolovakia 
under an austrianhungarian contract signed on may 29 1986 
austrian companies will carry out 70 percent of the 483 million 
worth of construction work 
a delegation of four was allowed to enter the embassy to hand 
over a resolution protesting austrias financial participation 
austria press agency reported 
it said the austrian ambassador was not there but promised the 
protesters by telephone a written reply to their plea

nearly onequarter of japans population has signed 
a petition calling for total nuclear disarmament the group 
sponsoring the petition said today 
the signature drive has proven so successful that the united 
nations wont accept the signatures because of a lack of storage 
space said kazuya yasuda a spokesman for the japan council 
against atomic and hydrogen bombs 
he said that since 1985 more than 28 million people have signed 
the petition there are about 120 million people in japan 
the council had originally hoped to present the signatures to 
the united nations in new york but were politely requested not to 
yasuda said 
it would take about 600 large cardboard boxes to hold all the 
signatures and the un told us it simply doesnt have the space 
to store them all he said 
instead the group supported by the japan communist party 
plans to select 900000 of the signatures for presentation to the 
un by 340 council members who are scheduled to visit new york 
early next month 
the presentation of the signatures is being scheduled to 
coincide with the united nations third special session on 
disarmament japanese prime minister noboru takeshita is due to 
deliver a speech at the session on june 1 
the signatures symbolize the antinuclear weapons attitude of 
the japanese people but we understand the position of the un 
yasuda said

fourteen state prison employees 
including a cellhouse superintendent and several guards have been 
indicted on charges of possessing and distributing marijuana and 
cocaine officials said 
the indictment followed a twomonth probe by the illinois state 
police that brought charges against the superintendent two 
captains three lieutenants and eight other employees us 
attorney j william roberts said friday 
thirteen suspects were arrested friday morning during a shift 
change at pontiac correctional center 
their cars and the guards quarters outside the maximumsecurity 
prison were searched but no drugs were found said state 
corrections director michael lane they were released later on 
personal recognizance bonds after appearing before a us 
magistrate 
the other suspect whose name was withheld was still at large 
roberts said 
prisoners apparently were not involved in the alleged conspiracy 
and did not receive drugs roberts said 
lane said he didnt view the indictments as a black eye on his 
agency but rather as evidence the department is willing to clean 
house when necessary 
the number of arrests and prosecutions throughout the 
department of corrections have increased every year for the past 
five years he said 
these are not charges of distributing drugs within the prison 
they are charges of distributing drugs within the community among 
the guard ranks among each other as well as some instances of 
simple possession roberts said 
the sealed indictments returned thursday by a federal grand 
jury here mark the biggest drug case in the state prison system in 
recent years lane said 
the suspects face charges of drug conspiracy possession and 
distribution involving cocaine and marijuana if convicted some 
could face sentences up to 40 years in prison and a 2 million fine 
more charges and arrests were expected as the probe continued 
roberts said 
the investigation codenamed operation white shirt was 
ordered by lane who described it as part of an effort to weed out 
illegal drugs from the prison system 
regrettably this is apparently what its going to take to 
have a drugfree workplace in the department of corrections lane 
said 
a former corrections officer lt cesar roland chavez 34 of 
odell was arrested march 17 in bloomington on a charge of selling 
cocaine authorities discovered chavez kept a ledger said to 
contain the names of people who bought drugs from him and those 
with whom he conducted legitimate business 
chavez was a central figure roberts said 
chavez wasnt indicted by the grand jury and roberts said he 
doubts any federal charges will be filed against him

drug dealers are tossing money out of 
their fancy cars in an effort to lure youngsters in a poor 
neighborhood into the world of drug trafficking police say adding 
theres little they can do to stop them 
what do you charge them with littering they are theyre 
throwing bits of paper out the car window the problem is everyone 
is out there picking it up assistant city attorney peter warner 
said friday 
the money handouts probably will not last long said lt richard 
dugan head of the narcotics unit their motive is just to make 
themselves look good other people look at them and say hey wow 
look at how rich they are 
these people arent enormously rich dugan said theyre 
drug dealers but theyre not millionaires theyre driving flashy 
cars and thats it the rest of their life is nothing 
monday through wednesday several people police say are believed 
to be involved in drug dealing began throwing money mostly dollar 
bills from the sun roofs of a blue mercedes a black mercedes and 
a bmw there were some reports of bills as large as 50 winding up 
in the grateful hands of neighborhood youngsters 
if youve been to a parade and you know when the clowns come 
by and throw candy and the kids all scurry its the same thing 
warner said 
even though police know who the people are they cant charge 
them with a crime because no laws have been violated while its 
not against the law to toss money into the street officials have 
considered citing the suspected dealers for littering or charging 
them with creating a public nuisance 
city council member bill wilson said he received reports of 
children ages 10 to 15 flocking after cars and picking up money 
five dollars 10 even 20 just tossed out the window 
wilson said they even set up contests among the kids and bet on 
who will win i heard that the winners get hundreds of dollars 
police said the amount of money being tossed to children has 
been exaggerated dugan said he understands the concerns of parents 
in the neighborhood but he cautioned against overreacting 
i think the whole thing is blown out of proportion he said 
i think its just a couple of isolated incidents it doesnt have 
any significance as far as im concerned 
but members of the summituniversity neighborhood say theyre 
outraged by the handouts 
i am shocked said the rev james w battle pastor of mount 
olivet baptist church its a new one on me it doesnt make 
sense to me they already have more people selling drugs than they 
need

two brothers who tried to stop a small 
grass fire from spreading were electrocuted by a downed powerline 
as their father tried desperately to free them authorities said 
david connelly 18 and his brother peter 19 were driving by 
an orchard with their parents don and suzanne connelly at about

the brothers got out to help but apparently did not see the 
12000volt live wire that had snapped and started the fire near an 
intersection in sebastopol about 60 miles north of san francisco 
david connelly apparently picked up the line 
we found it in his hand said greg berry a sonoma county 
coroners investigator he probably never knew what hit him 
peter connelly grabbed his brother and received the full impact 
of the current berry said 
their father was hospitalized with minor burns he received when 
he tried to intercede and their mother also was burned slightly 
rescuers with the twin hills fire protection districts 
volunteer fire department said they were unable to free david from 
the live wire until the power was shut off an hour later by a

after 12 weeks on the picket line striking 
tv and movie scriptwriters for such popular programs as the cosby 
show and highway to heaven will return to work under 
independent contracts 
seventythree independent production companies had signed the 
pacts by friday writers guild of america officials said according 
to union estimates the signings will put 200 to 400 writers back 
to work 
wga members overwhelmingly approved the contracts during voting 
in new york and los angeles on thursday union spokeswoman cheryl 
rhoden reported 
eightysix percent of the 2016 guild members who voted endorsed 
the proposal she said 
negotiators for both writers and the alliance of motion picture 
and television producers agreed to continue their negotiations to 
completely resolve the strike the two sides were to meet in small 
groups today and had scheduled a formal bargaining session with a 
federal mediator for tuesday 
in the meantime the producers group downplayed the signings of 
the independent production companies as an insignificant episode in 
the 3monthold strike that has stalled preparations for the new 
fall television season 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg estimated the independent 
contracts which give in to writers key pay demands cover about 1 
percent of the unions working members and none of the big 
production companies that make up the backbone of the industry 
group 
not one alliance member is in this group steinberg said of 
the producers who had signed 
actor michael landon expressed gratification however that 
michael landon productions the company that produces his show 
highway to heaven was able to come to terms with the writers 
the only thing that matters to me is that it ends the strike 
for the people that work for my company landon said they have 
all been innocent victims and now they can all get back to work 
producers of other popular shows that signed agreements included 
the tonight show starring johnny carson its garry 
shandlings show and alf 
however steinberg said many of those who had settled by friday 
were oneperson writerproducer companies including some that 
produce tv shows that have been canceled including the smothers 
brothers new comedy show and days and nights of molly dodd 
but ms rhoden saw the defections as a break in management ranks 
and called it a symbolic victory for striking writers 
the threeyear waiver contracts grant the striking writers key 
demand retention of the present formula for the residual payments 
that writers get for syndication of onehour television shows 
producers are seeking to tie the amount paid to writers to the 
level of success or failure a show encounters in the syndication 
market

despite attacks on four new york city teachers 
in a week the number of teachers assaulted in the past three years 
has decreased mainly because of an increase in security guards in 
elementary schools officials say 
the head of the teachers union on friday acknowledged a downward 
trend in attacks but said adding security personnel wasnt enough 
especially in light of the blood spilled during the week 
one attack against a teacher is outrageous and to have four in 
one week is just intolerable said united federation of teachers 
president sandra feldman and were afraid that this is just the 
tip of the iceberg 
the uft wants security guards in every school and police 
officers deployed in troubled neighborhoods to protect teachers and 
children involved in outdoor afterschool activities 
the union is also pushing for legislation to make any physical 
attack on a teacher a felony offense even if it only involves 
pushing or punching ms feldman said a bill is pending in the 
state senate 
she praised new schools chancellor richard green for his 
proposal to put metal detectors in five violenceprone schools this 
fall 
mayor edward i koch announced a summit meeting for tuesday 
to find out what can be done to improve teacher safety it will be 
attended by the chancellor union leaders the five district 
attorneys and police commissioner 
a 17yearold bronx youth was arrested friday night and charged 
in the latest attack in which a physical education teacher was 
beaten unconscious with a baseball bat after he confronted an 
intruder rifling through students gym bags outside a bronx school 
thursday afternoon 
gary smith 37 was in critical but stable condition at lincoln 
hospital late friday after undergoing surgery for a ruptured right 
eye at this point we dont know if hell see or not from that 
eye said robert medina a hospital administrator 
smith the fourth city school teacher assaulted during the week 
regained consciousness friday morning medina said the results of 
a cat scan were not immediately known 
teacher douglas de marco who was knifed more than a dozen times 
monday by a mugger in the bathroom of a south bronx grammar school 
said theres something seriously wrong here 
the need for increased security has long been evident to de 
marco who said he teaches in a neighborhood thats known for two 
things heroin and crack 
the other attacks included a teacher who was beaten up by a 
student the students brother and sister and a 71yearold 
teacher who was injured when she picked up an m80 firecracker 
tossed into her classroom 
yet the board of education said the number of assaults in city 
schools have decreased mainly because of an increase in security 
guards in elementary schools 
there were 1322 assaults in the citys 1000 schools in 
198586 1335 in 198687 and 969 so far this year board 
spokesman bob terte said 
those figures included 337 teachers assaulted in 198586 297 in 
198687 and 198 this year he said the rest were on students and 
other school personnel including custodians and cafeteria workers 
terte described an assault as anything from a shove against a 
wall to more violent incidents

political reasons 
in a brief commentary two days before the scheduled arrival of

the senates democratic and republican leaders 
are sending a present to moscow for president reagan the first 
superpower arms treaty since 1972 with a little blue ribbon tied 
around it 
the senate voted 935 friday to approve the accord banning 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles far more than the twothirds 
majority required by the constitution 
when majority leader robert byrd and minority leader bob dole 
called reagan in helsinki finland to tell him the news the 
president invited them to treaty ceremonies in moscow next week 
during his summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
they accepted on the spot 
the treaty documents themselves were to be taken to reagan by 
white house chief of staff howard baker who was leaving washington 
today byrd and dole were to leave sunday for wednesdays 
ceremonial exchange of ratification papers between the two heads of 
state 
we are very pleased to be able to give you this in advance of 
your stepping on soviet territory dole rkan told the 
president 
well have a little blue ribbon tied around it added byrd 
dwva 
this is really americas treaty said dole who added that 
the lopsided vote reflected the will of all americans to reduce the 
nuclear threat 
reagan in a statement welcomed the action but he added i 
continue to have concerns about the constitutionality of some 
provisions added to the resolution of ratification by the senate 
that appeared to be a reference to a provision added by byrd 
that sharply restricts the executive branchs future ability to 
change its interpretation of treaty provisions byrd claimed the 
addition made the senate and the white house equal partners in 
treaty making 
the provision stems from a dispute between the senate and the 
administration over white house efforts to redefine the 1972 
ussoviet antiballistic missile treaty to allow greater latitude 
for testing of reagans star wars missile defense program 
passage of the treaty the first such act since the abm treaty 
was approved 16 years ago gave cause for optimism to those who 
see the relatively modest inf accord as paving the way for a more 
ambitious treaty making deep cuts in the two sides arsenals of 
longrange nuclear missiles 
we are making a breakthrough said senate majority whip alan 
cranston dcalif it is not a substantively significant treaty 
but it lays the foundation for future treaties that can 
substantially reduce the scale cost and dangers of this arms 
race 
senators voting against the treaty were republicans jesse helms 
of north carolina steve symms of idaho gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire and malcolm wallop of wyoming and democrat ernest 
hollings of south carolina 
humphrey a staunch conservative called the treaty president 
reagans most serious foreign policy mistake because it would 
weaken allied defense of western europe while having little effect 
on the soviet threat 
i believe the senate has served the country poorly by letting 
itself be caught up in summit fever he said 
sens joseph biden ddel and john glenn dohio did not 
vote biden is recuperating from surgery glenn missed the vote 
because of the death of his motherin law 
the inf treaty signed by reagan and gorbachev in washington on 
dec 8 requires the elimination within three years of all nuclear 
missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3400 miles and would result 
in the destruction of 867 us missiles in europe and 1752 soviet 
missiles

a sponsor of beijings first beauty contest said 
today that the event would take place after all although it will 
be scaled down and not be televised 
earlier this week beijing television studio one of two 
sponsors of the capitals first beauty contest since the communist 
takeover in 1949 said the pageant had been canceled because 
conditions for such an event are not yet ripe 
but contemporary television magazine said today that the finals 
would be held as planned on june 5 
we have planned this event out very well it is not like 
beauty contests in other places in china we are not following the 
beauty contest fever said a spokeswoman who identified herself 
only as guan 
after the announcement in april that beijing would host a 
contest to select ten girls of youth and elegance other cities 
quickly followed suit creating a beauty contest craze in china and 
generating much discussion about whether they are appropriate in a 
country with a low standard of living 
organizers of a beauty contest in jiangxi province one of the 
nations poorest were criticized for hosting the 15day event when 
1 million of the provinces farmers were still living in poverty 
shanghai called off its contest for a shanghai maiden two 
weeks ago also giving the reason that conditions are not ripe 
in canton organizers said they would go ahead with its beauty 
contest and the final selection for miss canton and mr 
canton were scheduled for today but the local media was told to 
play down the event and the organizing television station also 
scrapped plans to televise the contest live 
organizers of the beijing contest planned to choose their ten 
beauties through a television contest after 40 days of preliminary 
judging 
however guan said the finals would not be televised reporters 
would not be allowed to attend and there would be no news 
conference afterwards 
she did not say if only foreign reporters were to be barred 
when china held its first beauty contest in 1985 in canton only 
chinese reporters were allowed to attend because organizers 
apparently were afraid of negative publicity 
more than 800 beijing women signed up for the competition and 
the field had been narrowed down to 50 by last week 
contestants are judged on their talent in singing dancing 
reading and answering questions designed to reveal their knowledge 
and moral values

bald eagles have built a nest in 
massachusetts for the first time in nearly a century but state 
officials say it could be another spring before the birds lay eggs 
the nest spotted in a red oak tree near the quabbin reservoir 
was built by a young female and ross the first male eagle the 
state raised and released in its sixyearold attempt to restore a 
breeding population of the endangered birds ellie horwitz a 
spokeswoman for the state division of fisheries and wildlife said 
friday 
no eggs have been found but she said young eagles which mate 
for life often practice building a nest a year or two before 
raising young 
what it really means is that our restoration program is 
working the way we had hoped she said 
the last active bald eagle nest in massachusetts was reported in 
1910 in the cape cod town of sandwich she said 
state biologists have been unable to get close enough to the 
female to check the band she is wearing but they suspect she may 
be a younger bird not yet of breeding age ms horwitz said it 
normally takes about five years for bald eagles to grow into 
maturity 
at least two other states with similar restoration efforts new 
york and pennsylvania now have nesting eagles according to mary 
beth moss of the national wildlife federation 
last year the group counted 8534 bald eagles in the lower 48 
states during its annual eagle census totals for this years count 
were not yet available but 34 were spotted at the quabbin 
reservoir

american fishermen would be allowed to fish in 
soviet waters for the first time under an agreement that soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and president reagan are expected to 
sign during their summit meeting 
the agreement also would require joint efforts to conserve and 
manage bering sea fisheries 
we reached agreement in principle two days ago in moscow ed 
wolfe the state departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries 
said friday it will be signed during the summit 
wolfe declined to say when the signing was scheduled during the 
moscow summit which begins sunday he spoke by telephone from his 
washington dc office and said he had just returned thursday 
night from moscow 
the 10page pact is a final version of a tentative agreement 
reached by the two countries in february 
this is exceedingly important to us economically said arni 
thomson executive secretary of the alaska crab coalition in 
seattle 
industry and congressional sources said that under the agreement 
us fishermen will for the first time have access to crab 
bottomfish and other resources in soviet waters adjacent to alaska 
thomson said his group was negotiating for licenses and space in 
siberian ports 
we would like to be the first to fish in their zone he said 
of the 175 us crab boats that have had pinched seasons for nearly 
a decade 
most deals he said would involve joint ventures with the 
soviets in fishing and marketing the soviets would gain access to 
superior american crabbing techniques and profit from trade at the 
ports 
the soviets who for years have been allowed to fish us 
waters will have greater access to underutilized american 
fisheries including mackerel off the us east coast and hake off 
the west coast 
the united states and the soviet union identify as areas of 
mutual interest management of fisheries resources in the bering 
sea including international waters 
the agreement specifically commits the two nations to consult 
and work together on ways to address the effects of unregulated 
fishing in the doughnut hole rep don bonker dwash said 
friday 
the doughnut hole is a triangularshaped 50000squaremile 
chunk of international waters where us officials fear heavy 
fishing by several countries could result in the decline of 
bottomfish stocks another area of mutual interest for the united 
states and soviet union is management of salmon stocks on the high 
seas 
the agreement is a further example of the improving relations 
between the united states and the soviet union said wolfe 
the united states and the soviet union for the past decade have 
conducted joint fishing efforts with american catcher boats 
providing soviet processing ships with hake yellowfin sole and 
other bottomfish 
thomson said the latest agreement could mean millions of dollars 
to crabbers who have had lean years the past decade after alaskas 
king crab fishery inexplicably shriveled up 
however he said fishermen whose boats require a 5000 
investment a day to break even while fishing are concerned about 
costs the soviets might impose 
if a fleet of 15 to 20 of the crab boats were to fish for the 
soviets he said the boats would need a return of 15 million to 
20 million for six months work 
he said soviets were especially interested in deepwater crab 
fishing a technique american fishermen have learned only the past 
five or six years it is the only way crab in deep water can be 
harvested he said 
bonker said the agreement could mean greater cooperation in 
collecting fisheries data in the bering sea for management and 
monitoring the fishing boats from various countries both countries 
have accused others including japan of pirating their fisheries 
we have a resource that is in us waters soviet waters and 
international waters said bonker of the fish that wander across 
political boundaries it moves around we all have a stake in 
whether that resource is overfished or depleted

assault rifle guarded the entrance to the sixstory apartment 
building 
the soldier who refused to be named only allowed residents

president roh taewoo met with the 
nations top three opposition leaders today and agreed to overhaul 
south koreas powerful intelligence agencies and keep them from 
meddling in politics his aides said 
all four men pledged to work together to promote democracy 
through dialogue and compromise said chief presidential 
spokesman lee soojung 
lee said the accord was reached during a fourhour meeting 
between roh kim daejung kim youngsam and kim jongpil their 
first such encounter since roh took office feb 25 
the four leaders agreed that south korea has been moving rapidly 
towards democracy since a new constitution was adopted last year 
the spokesman said 
the leaders also said south korea should continue to seek 
reforms in all sectors and rejected violence as a means to change 
society lee said 
all three opposition leaders said the meeting was beneficial 
kim daejung head of the largest opposition group the party 
for peace and democracy called the meeting sincere and frank 
the 62yearold kim said however he had failed to get rohs 
promise to free all prisoners of conscience 
roh said he would set free as many political prisoners as 
possible if they repent but made it clear that it would be 
difficult to release those who committed serious crimes such as 
murder and arson lee said 
roh pointed out that 1275 political offenders had already been 
set free under three government amnesties last year and early this 
year 
government officials said between 250 and 300 people are 
currently in jail serving terms or awaiting trial for political 
offense dissidents claim the number is much higher 
roh pledged to reform south koreas influential state security 
apparatus which has been responsible for arresting many of the 
political prisoners 
south koreas intelligence agencies have exerted a strong 
influence on past governments 
as the governing party candidate roh defeated the three 
opposition leaders last december in south koreas first direct 
presidential elections in 16 years roh won with only 366 percent 
of the vote 
the elections were called after the government of former 
president chun doohwan under mounting public pressure agreed to 
opposition demands for sweeping democratic reforms 
a new constitution was subsequently adopted in a national 
referendum 
the opposition made a strong comeback in legislative elections 
in april stripping rohs governing party of its parliamentary 
majority for the first time in south koreas 40year history 
since the legislative election setback roh has promised to work 
with the opposition 
the political leaders exchanged views on this falls olympic 
games in seoul and agreed to do their best to persuade north korea 
to take part in the games lee said roh made it clear however 
that it would be impossible to make north korea a cohost 
north korea has said it will boycott the games unless it is made 
a cohost 
the political leaders also agreed to investigate a 1980 civiling 
uprising in the southern city of kwangju that left nearly 200 
people dead the spokesman said 
and they agreed to investigate past official corruption though 
roh said he hoped any such probes would not include former 
president chun who stepped down at the end of his term in south 
koreas first peaceful transfer of power

yugoslavia today devalued its 
currency by 239 percent and instituted massive price increases as 
part of an austerity program instituted to battle a 170 percent 
annual inflation rate 
gasoline prices went up by an average 361 percent electricity 
by 314 percent postal services by 281 percent rail transport by 
385 percent and coal by 303 percent a government announcement 
said 
the government also lifted price controls for about 60 percent 
of the goods under a price freeze since last november it said 
those prices can now be determined by the market 
the prices of such staples as cooking oil flour and milk 
remained frozen and will continue to be under government control 
said the announcement carried by the official tanjug news agency 
the economic package also includes a reduction of wages by up to 
30 percent at a time when 80 percent of manufacturers in the 
country have already announced higher prices for their products 
devaluation price rises and wage cuts are a part of an 
austerity program decreed in conjunction with the international 
monetary fund 
in addition to seeking to eventually curb inflation the program 
intends to help repay the countrys 20 billion debt by introducing 
a more marketoriented economy inflation is expected to increase 
by between 8 and 12 percent as a result of the price increases 
the unpopular measures are likely to contribute to a further 
decline of living standards which have already fallen by onethird 
since 1980 
labor unrest is also expected to grow 
in the past several weeks after the government unveiled the 
austerity program several thousand workers staged a wave of 
strikes to protest the planned reduction of wages 
yugoslavia registered an alltime record of over 1600 strikes 
last year more than 300000 workers were involved 
the austerity program was originally scheduled to start may 15 
but the government said it was putting it off because of the lack 
of new loans expected from western creditors 
in its announcement the government did not say if it had 
obtained about 400 million of new loans from western creditors 
previously said to be necessary to start the program 
the lowering of the exchange rate of the yugoslav national 
currency the dinar which took effect today is based on the may 
27 dinar value according to the official daily exchange list 1 
is now worth 192275 dinars 
the dinar cannot be converted into foreign currencies in 
yugoslav banks 
the lower dinar is intended to improve the foreign trade 
imbalance by making yugoslav goods cheaper abroad however the 
devaluation makes imports too expensive for yugoslavs 
the last dinar was last devalued in november but it continued 
to lose its value daily against foreign currencies in relation to 
the american dollar its value has dropped over 250 percent in a 
year 
the gasoline price hike resulted from the devaluation of the 
dinar which makes foreign oil purchases more expensive in local 
currency the retail price of gasoline is now the equivalent of 
about 2 a gallon

the collective soviet presidency today unanimously 
ratified the superpower treaty scrapping both nations mediumrange 
nuclear missiles swiftly following the us senates approval a 
day earlier 
approval by both nations of the accord signed at the washington 
summit in december clears away any doubt about the treatys fate 
and strikes a positive note on the eve of president reagans 
arrival for his summit with kremlin leader mikhail s gorachev in 
moscow 
the session of the presidium was shown live on soviet television 
something that rarely has been done in the past 
the present summit opens up new vistas said lev n zaikov 
a politburo member and moscow communist party boss adding that the 
meeting inspires us with hope that even greater agreements will 
be reached

pressure on the soviet union applied by the united states but a 
mutually beneficial pact that would advance stability

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini today asked 
irans parliament to do more for the nations poor after 
legislative elections that boosted radicals seeking economic reform 
irans leader also renewed his declarations that the 7yearold 
persian gulf war with iraq would be settled on the battlefield not 
at the negotiating table 
he made his remarks in an inaugural message read to the 
270member majlis or parliament by his son and aide ahmed 
earlier president ali khamenei acknowledged that iraq won 
victories recently in the ground war but said they would not affect 
final outcome of the conflict 
the 87yearold khomeini who was reported to be ill asked the 
majlis to simplify irans complicated government system 
i hope that by close cooperation between the majlis the 
council of guardians and other experts the problems of the 
deprived can be solved he said in the message read by his son 
and carried by tehran radio laws are submitted to the council of 
guardians after they pass through parliament 
in iran deprived is a codeword for urban and rural poor 
they were a major force in the revolution that overthrew shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi in 1979 
khomeini has increasingly come down on the side of the radicals 
they favor price controls a minimum wage land redistribution and 
other measures to help deal with runaway inflation and economic 
inequities 
they are opposed by conservative believers in private property 
many of whom are clerics or merchants and whose views are heavily 
represented in the council of guardians 
the parliament was elected in two rounds of balloting in april 
and earlier this month the exact breakdown of power blocs was not 
yet known but based on announced results the radicals clearly 
gained influence 
the new fouryear parliament is the third since the revolution 
referring to irans armed forces khomeini said in his message 
the combatants must continue their fight by depending on their 
faith in god and their weapons he said the fate of the war 
will be decided on the war fronts not through negotiations 
the official islamic republic news agency reported that the 
president khamenei also addressed the inaugural session and told 
the deputies they must work for social justice 
tehran radio earlier said khamenei told worshipers in a prayer 
sermon friday on the campus of tehran university that war has a 
twosided aspect 
you will not find in any of the wars in the world which last 
a long time one side always winning and the other always losing 
if one side constantly wins and the other constantly loses the war 
will not last it will be over he was quoted as saying 
the remarks followed two major battlefield defeats for iran the 
recapture by iraq of the southern faw peninsula april 18 and of a 
chunk of iraqi territory east of the port city of basra on 
wednesday 
khamenei said iraq has had one or two victories and 
successes these successes of the enemy are not beyond our 
expectation 
the language used by the iranian president to concede the 
defeats was unusually blunt reflecting the scale of the reverses 
suffered by iran since midmay 
in addition to the defeats in the ground war us forces on 
april 18 destroyed iranian offshore platforms sank a patrol boat 
and crippled two frigates in a series of clashes in the persian 
gulf 
irans staterun media already had conceded that iranian forces 
withdrew from some of their positions east of basra and after the 
faw battle it indirectly admitted setbacks by accusing united 
states forces of intervening on iraqs side 
but khamenei assured his audience that iran would prevail 
we have no doubt that the nation which will have the last word 
and which will inflict the last blow is this same heroic and 
martyrnurturing nation which in the course of these years has 
not for a moment felt a sense of weakness in confronting the big 
powers he said 
the great movement by the people towards final objectives and 
final victory has been charted by the imam khomeini and the 
people are willingly and diligently following this path 
western military and political analysts have said it is too 
early to tell whether the string of defeats will represent a 
turning point in the war 
but they say the setbacks have badly jolted the tehran 
leadership at a time of growing economic woes and a power struggle 
between radicals who want a staterun economy and conservatives who 
back private property rights

the us 
navy has for the first time introduced to the persian gulf its 
billiondollar aegis cruisers one of the fleets most 
sophisticated warships 
the move may lead to another scaling back of the american force 
now operating in the waterway 
capt will c rogers iii skipper of the vincennes said that 
despite its many capabilities including what us officers call 
the most powerful surveillance radar system afloat his ship did 
not represent an escalation of the us armed presence in the 
wartorn waterway 
lets face it its a low level threat rogers said 
referring to iran we dont consider the iranians an enemy were 
not at war with them 
while rogers described his ships main role in the gulf as 
antiaircraft surveillance several officers and crew members said 
they were mystified as to why their ship was deployed here and by 
the haste in which the assignment was ordered 
the vincennes had just one days notice and spent only 90 hours 
in port preparations before making a 32day 1300mile dash across 
the pacific from san diego calif to the gulf of oman where it 
arrived may 22 
after arriving in goo as us sailors call the gulf of 
oman the vincennes did not enter the persian gulf immediately as 
expected by some of its officers and crew 
the vessel entered the gulf only on saturday some officers said 
the delay apparently occurred because senior us officials did not 
want the powerful warship to sail through the strait of hormuz the 
gateway to the gulf while iran was conducting several days of 
naval maneuvers in the area 
the 9400ton vincennes one of ten ships of its type now in 
commission sailed into the gulf overnight with its crew of 385 
positioned at battle stations the ship threaded the socalled 
silkworm envelope in the narrow strait where iran has deployed 
mobile batteries of chinesemade silkworm antiship missiles along 
the coast 
the ship passed a panamanianflagged tanker still on fire after 
an iranian attack 20 hours earlier salvage tugs sprayed water on 
it as the vincennes sailed past about four miles away the attack 
was the second on a neutral tanker in the last two days and the 
fourth since may 18 
according to rogers the vincennes is the replacement for the 
guided missile cruiser wainwright and will take over the 
antiaircraft surveillance role performed since february by that 
ship one of five leaving the gulf in the next few days 
but with five other ships including the destroyer john hancock 
and four guided missile frigates entering the waterway the overall 
strength of the navys gulfbased squadron known as the middle 
east force will increase by a net of one to 17 
although he described his ship as making essentially a 
oneforone switch with the wainwright it will bring to the 
wartorn gulf a multimission capability equivalent to several 
us warships now on duty there rogers said 
aegis is a state oftheart computerized radar surveillance 
and missile weapons system that is designed to enable the ship to 
manage a battle situation in defense of an aircraft carrier battle 
group 
putting this ship with its radar into the gulf will put a lot 
of battle management on the scene maybe we will be able to reduce 
the force level in the gulf and back away from the recent 
tensions rogers told members of a pentagon news media poole 
aboard the vincennes 
he said the gas turbinepowered ship burned a million gallons of 
fuel on the trip as it sailed at 23 mph on the 32day voyage 
crew members said the cruiser monitored the naval maneuvers 
along the iran coast from about 15 miiles away they said they 
could see aircraft and one large warship which was tentatively 
identified as one of the two world war iivintage usbuilt 
destroyers in irans navy 
tensions in the gulf have run high since us and iranian naval 
forces engaged in a serious clash on april 18 
iran lost a total of six craft sunk or disabled in the april 18 
battle with the us navy including two if its four best frigates 
one of those has since been seen operating in the hormuz strait 
at least one of the americanbuilt destroyers was known to be 
operational although it had not been reported in action since last 
year when it fired a missile at an aircraft apparently iraqi

prime minister margaret thatcher confided to a 
guest recently that piled on her bedside table are collections of 
religious and philosophical essays 
the repercussions have been enormous there are major speeches 
aligning her rigorous policies of free enterprise and selfreliance 
with christian tenets biblical allusions are traded in parliament 
and there is furious public debate about whether god is on the side 
of thatcherism 
aides say the thatcher crusade to stake out the moral high 
ground for her rightwing policies partly reflects anger and 
resentment at the most persistent criticism of her nineyear 
tenure that she is uncaring favors the welloff and has divided 
britain 
mrs thatcher an anglican who grew up under the strict 
methodism of her father a smalltown grocer has launched the 
moral offensive along with a radical third term program described 
as verging on the wicked by david jenkins the bishop of durham 
in northern england 
it includes a welfare shakeup big tax breaks for the 
betteroff and plans for an unpopular local tax 
gerald priestland a leading author on religious affairs sees 
mrs thatchers public espousal of basic corner shop wesleyan 
methodism as seeking a deeper foundation for her political 
philosophy 
priestland 60 a former religious affairs correspondent for the 
british broadcasting corp said mrs thatcher buttonholed him 
last month at a party at her 10 downing st residence 
she confided that she has at her bedside the latest collection 
of essays by the chief rabbi by english roman catholic leader 
cardinal basil hume and by the english theological writer cs 
lewis priestland said in a telephone interview 
she is now taking an intense interest in that sort of thing i 
think it is partly because as we get older we do dont we 
but she also sees her premiership as more than a pair of dates 
and hoping it will be regarded as something of a movement 
she is not ashamed of thatcherism and is probably trying to 
dig its foundation a bit deeper 
politicians in britain a nominally protestant country where 
only about 10 percent of the 56 million people attend church 
regularly rarely make references to religion being an 
acknowledged agnostic is no handicap to election 
mrs thatcher however has dotted recent speeches with passages 
on family life morality and personal responsibility 
in a major address to the assembly of the church of scotland 
this month she declared that the message of the old and new 
testaments is that we must work and use our talents to create 
wealth 
it is not the creation of wealth that is wrong but the love 
of money for its own sake said the 62yearold conservative 
party leader 
we simply cannot delegate the exercise of mercy and generosity 
to others 
quoting from her recent reading she added christianity is 
about spiritual redemption not social reform 
in testy exchanges in the house of commons opposition labor 
party leader neil kinnock taunted which passage of the bible 
inspired all that could it have been matthew 2724 when pilate 
took water and washed his hands 
she retorted you debase everything 
the archbishop of canterbury the most rev robert runcie gave 
a guarded endorsement to the thatcher forays into religious 
philosophy saying he agreed with her advocacy of wealth creation 
but i would want to ask a little more about the questions of 
making wealth and at same time dividing a society in a way which 
makes the people who have fallen behind through no fault of their 
own feel on the edge of things runcie said in a radio interview 
methodist leaders were less charitable after mrs thatcher in 
another speech wednesday likened her policies to the philosophy of 
john wesley who founded methodism 250 years ago she quoted wesley 
as saying gain all you can give all you can 
mrs thatcher is casting about for a reply to the criticisms 
that have come from the churches said methodist church secretary 
general the rev brian duckworth wesleys sermon was a 
warning against greed 
labors kinnock said mrs thatchers latest special brand of 
bornagain conservativism has nauseated people right across the 
political and religious spectrum 
social democratic party leader david owen jibed theres no 
political party with a through line to god

prospects for progress at the moscow 
summit on nuclear arms control dimmed today as president reagan 
prepared for his talks with general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
two senior us officials said a prospective 
confidencebuilding measure due to be approved in moscow next 
week had fallen through 
they also told reporters that two other arms control measures 
may not be completed during reagans talks with gorbachev 
assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway said the soviets 
had turned down a us proposal for prenotification of missile 
test launches 
and lt gen colin powell the presidents national security 
adviser said two agreements on monitoring underground nuclear test 
explosions were not likely to be ready for reagan and gorbachev to 
approve 
the first deals with trying out us and soviet measuring 
devices at test explosions in july and augustthe joint experiments 
in nevada and at semipalatinsk apparently will proceed in july and 
august 
but powell said that a few technical issues have to be 
resolved the second protocol deals with socalled peaceful test 
explosions powell said negotiators were having difficulty 
reconciling the russian and english versions 
the explosions were limited to 150 kilotons in 1974 and 1976 
treaties reagan has said he would submit them to the senate for 
ratification if verification measures were improved it was not 
clear if the setback in summit plans would affect his plan 
mrs ridgway meanwhile did not explain why the tentative 
agreement to notify each other before missiles test launchings had 
fallen through 
she indicated the soviets wanted a more sweeping 
confidencebuilding measure that was unacceptable to the united 
states 
reagan spent more than two hours today in separate meetings with 
powell and secretary of state george p shultz as he prepared for 
sundays opening of the summit and said of reagan hes upbeat 
reagan in a prerecorded radio speech hailed improvements in 
human rights in the soviet union and eastern europe 
but he said the basic structure of the system has not 
changed and he said there remain significant violations of 
human rights and freedoms 
the speech was reagans weekly saturday radio broadcast 
in a telecast to the soviet union he appealed for more openness 
and religious freedom while praising gorbachev as a break with the 
past 
i have to say i think there is a difference between this 
general secretary and other of your leaders that i had met with in 
the past reagan said 
the interview was recorded before reagan left washington he 
will open talks in moscow with gorbachev on sunday 
stressing the human rights issue reagan noted that gorbachev 
had lessened some of the restrictions on the russian orthodox 
church 
ive just wondered if there isnt a field there in your own 
country for more openness and the allowing of people to practice 
religion in the ways they choose reagan said 
an ardent anticommunist throughout his political career reagan 
said none of gorbachevs predecessors had an dreams of 
restructuring the economy the program known as perestroika 
i felt that we had to exist in the world together he said 
our systems are different were going to be competitive in a 
number of ways and that will continue but we can be competitive 
without being hostile to the point of conflict with each other 
reagan on friday invited jubilant senate leaders to join him and 
gorbachev at the moscow summit to celebrate final ratification of a 
treaty banishing mediumrange nuclear missiles from european soil 
the treaty approved 935 by the senate on friday after weeks of 
heated debate represents the only brake on the arms race that 
reagan has been able to achieve during his twoterm presidency and 
he seemed eager to make the most of it 
in moscow the collective soviet presidency today unanimously 
ratified the treaty 
a session of the presidium of the supreme soviet a 36member 
body headed by president andrei a gromyko met in special session 
and cast a traditional unanimous vote in favor of the pact 
reagan said he was very pleased by the overwhelming senate 
vote which enables him to enter next weeks summit talks carrying 
clear evidence of broad bipartisan support back home for his arms 
control policies 
white house chief of staff howard baker who stayed behind to 
await the senate vote was flying to helsinki late today to place 
the treaty documents in reagans hands before he leaves for moscow 
on sunday 
at the presidents request senate majority leader robert byrd 
dwva and minority leader bob dole rkan are to fly to the 
soviet capital on tuesday to witness reagans exchange of 
ratification documents with gorbachev the following day 
were just delighted that were going to send you a treaty and 
it was almost a unanimous vote byrd told reagan by telephone 
moments after the senate vote 
we are very pleased to be able to give you this in advance of 
your stepping on soviet territory in moscow dole said 
the treaty which reagan and gorbachev signed at their 
washington summit last december required some lastminute 
negotiations with the soviets to tighten compliance procedures it 
also survived determined opposition from a small band of 
conservative republicans led by sen jesse helms of north carolina 
in the meantime the president retreated into seclusion again 
the only major interruption in his presummit rest stop since his 
arrival early thursday morning was a major foreign policy speech to 
a finnish audience on friday 
white house aides kept reporters photographers and the 
television cameras away from the president otherwise marlin 
fitzwater the presidential spokesman denied a report that reagan 
seemed to be limping slightly when he stepped from a limousine to 
call on finnish president mauno koivisto 
in the speech delivered in the same hall where the 1975 
helsinki agreement on human rights was signed reagan urged the 
soviets to accelerate the pace of reform 
some of the measures taken by gorbachev in his three years at 
the kremlin helm are new and good reagan said but the soviets 
still fall short of meeting international standards on human rights 
and freedom 
ironically reagan called moscow to task over a pact which he 
had opposed in 1975 
political conservatives like reagan saw the 35nation agreement 
as accepting the postworld war ii borders of eastern europe and 
thereby approving soviet hegemony in the region 
however the pact sought to ease eastwest tensions by promoting 
a freer exchange of people and ideas it has since served as a 
handy weapon for critics of moscow 
soviet practice does not or does not yet measure up to 
soviet commitment reagan said

nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev 
allied perhaps only in the desire to help their husbands succeed at 
the moscow summit are expected to suppress their muchtouted 
rivalry in the interest of a smooth session 
but gossiphungry summit watchers will be alert for any hint of 
a new round in the purported superpower catfight be it an archly 
raised eyebrow from mrs reagan or an extended lecture to the us 
press corps from mrs gorbachev 
the two women have scheduled their first gettogether for sunday 
afternoon as president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev face off 
for the first time over a kremlin negotiating table 
soviet experts predict the two women will strive to put aside 
their differences and display goodwill at a summit that may prove 
to be more show than substance 
i suspect they both want to make sure that they dont get 
in the way and that they dont become part of the story in a 
negative sense said ed hewett a specialist in soviet studies 
and a senior analyst at the brookings institution in washington 
even though both women poohpoohed the idea they engaged in any 
form of competition at last decembers summit former white house 
chief of staff donald regan offered a behindthescenes peek at 
their relationship in his book for the record 
regan writes that mrs reagan was peeved at the frontpage 
attention garnered by mrs gorbachevs outspoken and fashionable 
style during the first ussoviet summit in geneva in 1985 
irritated by mrs gorbachevs extensive conversation at their 
first dinner mrs reagan sniffed afterwards who does that dame 
think she is regan wrote 
the former chief of staff also disclosed mrs reagans 
predeliction for stargazing in his book a subject that mrs 
reagan so far has not addressed or been questioned about and one 
that could dominate her early encounters with the media here 
mrs reagan is described privately by associates and white house 
aides as determined to try to squelch reports of any renewed 
disputes with gorbachevs wife during this meeting 
mrs reagan has always been a gracious hostess and has always 
been a courteous guest said shiela tate mrs reagans former 
press secretary youll see that she will be this time too 
ms tate a public relations executive with hill amp knowlton 
said the first lady has always seen her role as an extension of the 
diplomatic process 
she cares a lot about how she represents this country and so 
shell do her best said ms tate 
it turns out the two women will be spending a good deal of time 
together in moscow 
besides the visit to the kremlin cathedral of the assumption 
they are also scheduled to tour the tretyakov art gallery later in 
the week 
the president and mrs reagan will see their counterparts at the 
welcoming and departure ceremonies as well as the kremlin state 
dinner and the us reciprocal dinner held at the ambassadors 
residence spaso house 
the most lengthy and private encounter between the couples will 
come after they attend a performance of the bolshoi ballet the 
gorbachevs have invited them to dinner at a private country house 
or dacha outside the city 
but it is unclear whether reporters will have as much access to 
the two women as in the december summit when journalists were able 
to pepper them with questions during a nearly hourlong tour of the 
white house 
though the american couple is staying only five days in the 
soviet capital mrs reagan plans to spend an entire day in 
leningrad an hours flight away 
whether that trip was planned without mrs gorbachevs to 
alleviate some possible friction at this summit neither the white 
house nor soviet officials will say white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said saturday that mrs gorbachev had made a lastminute 
request that the wife of soviet president andrei gromyko accompany 
the us first lady to leningrad 
ms tate said she believes mrs reagan is well aware that it has 
been more than a dozen years since a us first lady and president 
visited soviet soil and is therefore intent on making a good 
impression with the soviet people 
ive always said while her husband represents the head of the 
country she represents the heart ms tate said 
a senior us official analyst who who spoke on condition he not 
be named said the oneupmanship that occurs when the two women 
meet isnt suprising 
the personal chemistry between the two women isnt good he 
said adding i guess thats because theyre much alike they 
are both strong women 
hewett said that compared to soviet wives in the past raisas 
role has been a remarkable one and that the couple has been 
attempting to show their nation its time to enter the 20th 
century 
but he noted that mrs gorbachev has been the target of internal 
soviet criticism for her high public stance and he predicted she 
will tone down the assertiveness she displayed in washington 
gorbachev wants the intermediate range nuclear forces 
treaty and other than that he wants an amiacable atmosphere at the 
summit to show that he is in charge hewett said adding that the 
first ladies can contribute to that notion 
on her own mrs reagan is scheduled to visit a soviet 
elementary school in moscow where shes expected to try out the 
few russian phrases shes been learning 
apparently stung by reports that she was not prepared for mrs 
gorbachevs forceful style and extensive knowledge of us history 
art and political theory mrs reagan embarked on her own course of 
study 
the first lady has read several books on soviet history 
culture art and the russian revolution said her spokeswoman 
elaine crispen 
she has also viewed several videos on the country including one 
produced by turner broadcasting system and a series on the country 
for abctvs good morning america reported by the couples son

secrets about us intelligence operations in 
iran and efforts to free americans held hostage in lebanon are 
among the blizzard of classified documents demanded from the 
government by oliver l north and his three irancontra 
codefendants 
some of the documents sought in the defenses extensive 
pretrial discovery motion are so sensitive independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh has said that their courtroom disclosure would 
jeopardize intelligence activities and could expose people in 
very difficult situations to torture and death in the middle east 
district judge gerhard a gesell will have to rule on whether to 
order walsh to give the defense the documents sought in the 88page 
discovery motion but the judge already has said the defense is 
entitled to review any papers that are relevant to the defense 
already more than 85000 pages of classified material have been 
turned over to the defense and an interagency task force is 
reviewing another 200000 pages bearing government secrets 
it is apparent from the defense request that north former 
national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
albert hakim and richard v secord want documents they know are so 
sensitive that agencies like the cia and the national security 
agency will fight hard to keep them secret 
if the defense can convince gesell that documents which the 
government wont declassify are crucial for its case the judge 
might be forced to dismiss crucial portions of the indictment 
walsh has conceded that he must defer to attorney general edwin 
meese iii on whether to disclose or withhold government secrets 
documents sought by the defense include material about us 
intelligence capabilities in iran and efforts to locate 
reserve or obtain information on american citizens held hostage in 
lebanon or elsewhere 
the defendants want to inspect highly classified message traffic 
between the united states and israel as well as intelligence 
intercepts regarding the transfer of american weapons by israel 
to iran in 1985 
secret court orders allowing electronic surveillance of iranian 
officials who visited washington in 1986 as part of the 
armsforhostages negotiations are also sought 
the defendants also want details about other covert operations 
conducted by the us government with the help of private citizens 
and companies 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel and his 
codefendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the government 
by diverting profits from the usiran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
the discovery motion initially filed under seal last week but 
later released signals that the defendants are trying to gather 
proof that many of their actions were approved by other officials 
in the reagan administration 
the defense wants notes of conversations with president reagan 
about the irancontra affair taken by vice president bush 
secretary of state george shultz former white house chief of staff 
donald regan meese and other top officials in the government 
it also seeks documents showing that other us officials 
provided funding or logistical or other support for the contras 
during the ban on us military aid imposed by congress 
the defendants requested documents indicating or tending to 
establish authorization approval knowledge or awareness by any 
officer employee or agent of the united states of the 
enterprise supply network as allegedly established by defendants 
north and secord to support military and paramilitary operations 
by the contras 
the defense motion said the documents sought are directly 
material to pivital defense issues including each defendants 
knowledge intent and motive as well as to the authority of the 
defendants to act for or on behalf or with the consent of the

defense minister oh jabok warned 
saturday that south korea faces a heightened military threat from 
north korea following the communist norths deployment of new 
sovietmade surfacetoair missiles 
oh issued the warning on the longerrange missiles during an 
emergency meeting of top military leaders to safeguard the olympic 
games which begin sept 17 in seoul 
the deployment of new missiles poses a serious threat to our 
security oh said 
the meeting was called after us army gen louis c menetrey 
commander of the us forces in south korea testified before a 
us senate subcommittee that north korea has introduced sa3 and 
sa5 missiles from the soviet union 
the sa5 surfacetoair missile especially poses a threat to 
aerial operations by us and south korean air force jets because 
it can cover the entire korean peninsula menetrey said 
oh said north korea can unleash a surprise attack on south korea 
at any time by deploying 65 percent of its ground troops and 57 
percent of its naval forces closer to the border separating the two 
koreas divided since 1945 
oh said that north korea has 41 percent of its air force jets 
stationed south of the strategic line linking pyongyang the 
capital and its eastern port city of wonsan 
the forward deployment can cut the flying time of north korean 
jets to the border to a matter of few minutes he said 
oh also said that north korea is currently trying to create 
false tension inside the demilitarized zone in an apparent move 
to hurt the olympics 
north korea has charged south korea with a number of alleged 
armistice violations including firing across the border and the 
introduction of illegal weapons into the dmz that separates the two 
sides 
south korea has denied the charges 
the south has in turn accused north korea of resorting to 
terrorist tactics to press its demands to serve as a cohost of the 
olympics south korea accused the north of bombing a korean air 
jetliner that disappeared over burma in november with 115 people 
aboard 
north korea denied responsibility but a woman who was a 
passenger on an early part of the doomed flight confessed to 
planting a bomb on the plane for north korea to disrupt the 
olympics 
as part of tightened security preceding the games a cabinet 
minister ordered police to maintain surveillance on foreigners 
spending long periods of time in south korea without a definite 
purpose 
home minister lee choonkoo who is in charge of the nations 
135000 police issued the order friday 
the government has inaugurated a 13000member police security 
task force to guard olympic athletes and facilities members were 
selected for martial arts and foreign language skills

doesnt really matter 
he was freed in kabul the afghan capital earlier in the day 
after gilbert perol secretary general of the french foreign 
ministry presented a letter from president francois mitterrand to 
afghan leader najib 
guillo said he believed he was released because of the french 
intervention and the summit beginning sunday between president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
he said his imprisonment in kabul was difficult 
i wasnt treated too badly but i was morally brutalized he 
said for the first four months i had no newspapers books or 
paper i was always under surveillance and deprived of fundamental 
rights 
guillo 45 arrived in new delhi en route to paris and reunion

he had entered afghanistan from pakistan with the rebels who were 
fighting soviet and government troops

arresting me formally guillo said of the afghan police they 
would have blamed the killing on the mujahedeen he said

the soviet unions collective presidency in a 
rare televised session unanimously ratified the ussoviet treaty 
banning mediumrange nuclear missiles a government spokesman 
described the action as a very good prelude to president 
reagans visit 
politburo member and moscow communist party boss lev n zaikov 
said the summit beginning sunday opens up new vistas in arms 
control the meeting inspires us with hope that even greater 
agreements will be reached he said in remarks to the presidium 
of the supreme soviet 
the presidium a cabinetlike council headed by president andrei 
a gromyko voted after more than an hour of speeches by members of 
the ruling politburo and other senior officials including defense 
minister dmitri yazov 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev sits on the 36member 
presidium but he appeared to be absent from the special meeting 
that was televised nationally 
the soviet action followed by only 17 hours the us senates 
935 vote to ratify the pact signed by reagan and gorbachev at 
their summit in washington in december 
reagan arrives sunday for five days of talks with gorbachev and 
soviet officials have been pressing for progress during the summit 
toward an accord to cut strategic missile stockpiles in half 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov hailed the 
ratification by both sides as a very good prelude to the summit 
here in moscow and said the next step should be conclusion of a 
strategic arms reduction treaty 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the treaty puts 
the policy of new thinking into action and will allow diversion 
of funds for use in the social sphere new thinking is 
gorbachevs term for his foreign policy program which has also 
been credited by the soviets for improving relations between the 
superpowers 
shevardnadze said the funds saved on weapons production would 
add 300 million rubles 508 million to the budget this year alone 
for nonmilitary programs like environmental protection 
transportation improvements and other services 
the foreign minister said the treaty was not the result of us 
pressure on the soviet union but a mutually beneficial pact that 
would advance stability 
politburo member yegor k ligachev said the treaty could herald 
the start of restructuring ussoviet relations but there are 
forces in the united states and europe opposed to disarmament it 
was not without impact of these forces that the process of 
ratification in the united states encountered certain 
difficulties 
the reagan administration had to fight off efforts by 
conservative senators to add crippling amendments that would have 
required reopening of negotiations on the pact 
yazov who was named defense minister a year ago said we 
dont have any doubt that without this treaty the americans would 
have continued to deploy pershings we would have had to take 
corresponding steps and the spiral of the arms race would have 
gone on and on 
genrikh borovik head of the soviet peace committee said at a 
press conference earlier saturday that us ratification was 
gratifying because it came without crippling amendments 
proposed by senate conservatives 
reagan commented in helsinki finland where he spent four days 
prior to his moscow visit that he was very pleased by the 
senates approval 
the treaty requires both sides to scrap their nuclear missiles 
capable of reaching distances of 300 to 3400 miles the soviet 
union has 1752 rockets of that range and the united states has 867 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty known as inf 
was signed by reagan and gorbachev on dec 8 and contains the most 
stringent verification procedures in arms control history 
reagan and gorbachev plan to exchange the final texts of the 
treaty as ratified by each side at a ceremony wednesday

george bush isnt likely to forget that night 
in july 1980 when his hopes of being the republican vice 
presidential nominee were dashed and then suddenly restored it was 
a night certain to have a profound impact on how bush goes about 
filling the no 2 spot on the 1988 gop ticket 
michael dukakis was only an observer of the long process that 
led walter f mondale to the historic decision to fill out the 1984 
democratic ticket with a woman but the impression that process 
created and the impact of disclosures about the dealings of 
geraldine ferraros husband are equally certain to affect how 
dukakis chooses a running mate 
the selection of a running mate is often described as the most 
important decision a presidential nominee makes 
and dukakis has followed tradition by declaring that his choice 
will be dictated by the need to have someone qualified to serve as 
president if heaven forbid something should happen to him 
thirteen vice presidents eventually moved to the top office 
eight of them upon the death of the president four others were 
later elected president though only one martin van buren was 
elected while serving as vice president one vice president gerald 
r ford gained the presidency when the incumbent richard m 
nixon was forced to resign 
despite the fact that nearly onethird of presidents first 
served as vice president the no 2 spot on the ticket historically 
has gone to someone chosen at the last possible moment for reasons 
based far more on politics than qualifications 
according to robert f kennedy texas sen lyndon b johnson was 
an accidental choice to be john f kennedys running mate in 1960 
the new book robert kennedy his own words quotes kennedy 
as saying that when his brother offered the vice presidential 
nomination to johnson he never dreamt there was a chance in the 
world he would accept it 
after johnson accepted the offer robert kennedy quoted his 
brother as asking now what do we do 
the brothers tried to convince johnson that putting him on the 
ticket would provoke a liberal revolt on the convention floor but 
johnson said he was willing to risk such a fight 
as it turned out johnsons presence on the ticket was a 
critical factor in helping kennedy carry southern states 
particularly texas in his narrow victory over nixon 
harry truman was little known outside his home state of missouri 
when he was tapped by franklin d roosevelt in 1944 
roosevelt cared little about the vice presidential nominee as he 
prepared to run for a fourth term although he decided well in 
advance of the democratic convention to dump henry a wallace who 
had served four years as vice president and wanted another four 
but southerners opposed wallace and he was not wellliked in the 
senate 
with world war ii moving to a close roosevelt was looking ahead 
to the possibility of senate fights over peace treaties and 
establishment of the united nations truman was popular with his 
senate colleagues 
in his memoirs truman recalled that when he arrived in chicago 
for the convention he brushed aside suggestions that he seek the 
vice presidency 
but trumans old friend from missouri robert hannegan was 
democratic party chairman and he was lobbying to get the senator 
on the ticket 
truman resisted when party leaders asked him to allow his name 
to be put forth to the convention as vice president 
then came a telephone call from roosevelt hannegan held the 
phone away from his ear and truman could hear the president say 
bob have you got that fellow lined up yet 
no hes the contrariest missouri mule ive ever dealt with 
replied hannegan 
well you tell him if he wants to break up the democratic party 
in the middle of a war thats his responsibility said 
roosevelt who then hung up 
ill have to say yes truman told hannegan 
eightythree days after taking office as vice president truman 
succeeded to the presidency 
ford was the first vice president to attain that office under 
the more deliberative process of the 25th amendment then after he 
succeeded nixon ford named gov nelson a rockefeller of new york 
as his vice president rockefeller won out over a littleknown 
texan named george bush 
in 1976 jimmy carter settled on minnesota sen mondale after a 
process in which prospective choices trooped to plains ga to be 
interviewed by carter 
eight years later mondale used a similar process the people 
who traveled to north oaks minn included three women a black a 
hispanic and a white southern senator 
when ferraro a congresswoman from new york was selected 
feminists were ecstatic but the benefits mondale reaped from the 
bold choice of a woman quickly faded when the following weeks 
brought headlines with accounts of her husbands business dealings 
bush was caught in one of the strangest sequences ever at a 
nominating convention 
the scene was joe louis arena in detroit on the night of july 
16 for days republicans had talked of a dream ticket made up 
of reagan and ford the former president would technically be vice 
president but would actually assume far greater responsibilities 
becoming in effect a copresident 
as the convention got under way that wednesday night bush was 
waiting to deliver a unity speech before the balloting to nominate 
reagan 
he recalled waiting in the wings when a backstage worker came 
by patted me on the back and said im sorry mr bush really 
sorry i was pulling for you 
sorry about what i asked as we shook hands 
you mean you havent heard its all over reagans picked 
ford as his running mate 
bush was described as furious as he left the hall angry that 
the reagan people had not told him of the decision to choose 
someone else 
but the ford option was looking less attractive among 
considerations that disturbed reagan advisers was the fact that 
during the campaign ford would be addressed as mr president 
while reagan would be referred to as governor 
then ford appeared on television being interviewed by walter 
cronkite he said that he would not go to washington as a 
figurehead vice president 
reagan was stunned to see the former president talking on 
national television about their private discussions the 
impossibility of the projected arrangement was growing clearer

although he has often railed against 
protectionist trade legislation president reagan has erected more 
anticonsumer trade barriers than any president since herbert 
hoover says a former top reagan economic adviser 
william niskanen a former member of reagans council of 
economic advisers said that time after time the administration has 
bowed to industry pressure to block imports 
in one industry alone autos niskanen estimated that the 
administrations policies ended up costing american consumers 11 
billion annually in higher car costs he said that worked out to 
240000 for each job saved in the domestic auto industry 
the consistent goal of the president was free trade both in 
the united states and abroad niskanen writes in a new book in 
response to domestic political pressure however the 
administration has imposed more new restraints on trade than any 
administration since hoover 
niskanens book entitled reaganomics an insiders account of 
the policies and the people is the latest published work by 
former top administration officials depicting behindthescenes 
white house struggles over policy 
like former budget director david stockman and former white 
house chief of staff and treasury secretary donald t regan 
niskanen paints a picture of a remote president who rarely 
understood the intricacies of the subjects being heatedly debated 
by his advisers 
at cabinet meetings he was visibly uncomfortable on being 
presented with a complex argument niskanen writes he was 
impatient to hear conclusions 
in a criticism that could be leveled about the current 
presidential campaign niskanen said that candidate reagan in 1980 
and 1984 resisted telling voters the hard choices that would be 
needed to reduce the federal budget deficit 
at no time during the 1980 and 1984 campaigns did reagan 
acknowledge that a substantial reduction in domestic programs was 
necessary to permit both a defense buildup and a tax rate cut 
without an increase in the deficit he said 
likewise in the trade area niskanen said that reagan found 
himself constrained by promises he made on the campaign trail in 
particular a pledge to chrysler workers in the fall of 1980 that 
one way or another japanese car imports to the united states 
would be reduced 
the way found by the administration was to pressure the japanese 
to put into place voluntary constraints on car imports the 
administration kept up pressure on the japanese to maintain the 
import quotas even after the auto industry was enjoying record 
profits and bestowing huge bonuses on its executives because it was 
in the midst of the 1984 presidential campaign niskanen said 
politics also played a part in an administration decision in 
october 1986 that imported softwood lumber from canada was being 
unfairly subsidized by the canadian government niskanen said that 
determination was clearly timed to save several republican senate 
seats in the timberproducing states 
trade is an issue in the 1988 campaign as well with democrats 
hoping to get political mileage out of reagans veto last tuesday 
of a trade bill which contained a laborbacked proposal requiring 
advance notification of plant closings and layoffs 
while sharply criticizing congress for protectionist bills 
reagan has granted import relief to such industries as autos 
steel machine tools textiles and apparel niskanen said 
a cynic might conclude that the administration wanted to 
maintain control of the distribution of protectionist favors and 
opposed only those trade constraints proposed by congress 
niskanen said 
a former chief economist at ford motor co niskanen joined the 
threemember council of economic advisers in 1981 as a conservative 
committed to reagans agenda of trimming back the federal 
government niskanen left the administration in 1985 and is now 
chairman of the cato institute a conservative washington think 
tank 
niskanen gives reagan credit for delivering at least partially 
on his campaign promises to lower the growth of government 
spending reduce tax rates and lower inflation but he concludes 
that there was no reagan revolution 
he blamed the failure of reagan to make more substantial 
progress in reducing the growth of government on the fact that as 
candidate and president reagan endorsed the major surviving 
programs of the new deal 
the primary reason why reaganomics did not prove to be a 
revolution is that there has not yet been a fundamental change in 
the perception about what the federal government should and should 
not do niskanen said 
niskanen said the next president should strive to get spending 
cuts in the programs which grew most rapidly during the reagan 
years agriculture defense and medical care 
he said that increased taxes would be needed as well but that 
the hikes should not come from raising tax rates but rather by 
going further in eliminating tax deductions a trend which was 
started by the 1986 tax overhaul legislation 
niskanen said there was no valid reason for maintaining 
deductions for state and local income taxes and property taxes he 
also proposed taxing fringe benefits employees receive and reducing 
the personal exemption to 300 instead of 2000

here is the text of the democratic partys 
weekly radio address as delivered saturday by rep fortney h 
stark of california 
hello im congressman pete stark of oakland calif i chair the 
health subcommitteee of the ways and means committee which 
oversees the medicare system in the united states and this week 
congress agreed to the first major expansion of medicare benefits 
in over 20 years 
before i explain that landmark legislation let me give credit 
where credit is due it was president reagan who a year ago last 
february suggested in his state of the union message that it was 
necessary to enact this legislation 
his secretary of health and human services dr otis bowen 
picked up the challenge and presented congress with an outline of a 
plan which republican congressman bill gradison of cincinnati ohio 
and i took and formed into the starkgradison bill of the 
catastrophic health bill which passed the conference committee last 
week 
what did all this do well let me tell my mom because i want 
to put it in terms shell understand and then maybe youll all 
understand 
mom youve got medicare now and under the hospital or part a 
benefits its pretty confusing you have to pay the first days 
hospital bill of 540 then you get the first 60 days care then 
from 60 to 90 days youve got to pay 135 a day then from 90 to 
150 days you get a lifetime exemption of those 60 days youve 
got to pay 270 and after that you have to pay the whole bill you 
could pay 20000 or even thousands more than that out of your own 
pocket 
under our bill you just pay once in a year the 540 for your 
first day in the hospital and medicare pays the rest simple you 
bet 
as to doctors bills you have to pay the first 75 and then you 
have to pay 20 percent of every bill that doctor sends you you 
could pay thousands in a year under our bill you still pay the 
75 and then you must pay 1440 out of your pocket but after 
your 1440 outofpocket medicare pays the rest 
now youve got to remember you go to a doctor who takes 
assignment or participates so that youre not charged more than 
the medicare approved rate 
and theres a new benefit a drug benefit you have prescription 
drugs in a year and previously youve received no help after 
youve spent 600 on precription drugs in one year under our bill 
the government will pay 80 percent of everything over 600 when the 
bill is fully implemented 
theres a new benefit that might help me if i were caring for 
you someday in your home its called respite care and the bill 
will provide 80 hours of professional home care for you so that i 
or my brother or anyone else who might be taking care of you could 
get a day off or have a vacation with their family we think thats 
a wonderful added benefit 
a special benefit ffor you mom is the new mammography benefit 
which allows you to have a mammographic examination every other 
year and you should do it its the first time weve added real 
preventive care benefits to medicare 
and for those couples who are together and one of them has to go 
to a nursing home under the medicaid program weve protected the 
other or surviving or healthy spouse from impoverishment weve 
allowed them to keep some assets and a minimum income so that they 
dont have to spend their entire assets and income for one spouse 
leaving the healthy spouse destitute we think thats a big help 
but i know youre saying mom gee pete youre a liberal 
democrat and whos gonna pay for all this well im happy to 
say mom you do it wont cost the treasury one penny youre 
going to pay 4 a month and eventually it will go up to 10 a 
month in a flat premium if you became impoverished medicaid would 
be required to pay the premium and your copay so lowincome 
people will pay nothing 
if youre around 75000 a year youd have to pay as high as 
80 a month but remember youd saved 25 to 50 a month in 
medigap policy premiums so that you really in general would have 
a super benefit its not longterm care but its a major 
improvement in paying hospital doctor and druggist bills 
so drive safely this memorial day weekend and i hope your new 
benefit makes you comfortable

boy george or no boy george the blaring beat of 
heavy metal reverberated through the night as thousands of 
soviet teenagers many dressed in jeans and punkstyle outfits 
sat mesmerized at a presummit rock concert under the open skies of 
gorky park 
they clapped politely at the end of each song and waved small 
paper flags printed with a big heart divided by the stars and 
stripes and the hammer and sickle 
gorky park central park whats the difference said 
william sloane coffin a veteran american peace activist who said 
he saw little difference between the concert and similar 
earsplitting events in the united states 
except that in america if the music is any good there is more 
pandemonium the soviet crowd was sedate by comparison they 
clapped politely at the end of each song and waved their small 
flags at one point as a pop group began its set people screamed 
briefly but immediately sat down 
sasha a 24yearold soviet said young people didnt dare act 
out for fear of reprisals from the omnipresent law enforcement 
authorities 
if we danced the cops would shackle our wrists he said he 
did not want his surname used 
groups of sternlooking police officers were intermingled with 
the audience while men with german shepherd dogs stood in the back 
coffin who delivered some remarks in russian between rock 
songs wasnt supposed to be the chief draw from the west he 
was supposed to play second fiddle to the peculiar british rocker 
boy george 
boy george never showed up but the show went on featuring 
primarily russian pop and heavy metal groups 
the event was sponsored by the soviet peace committee a 
spokeswoman for that group said boy george just didnt come 
she gave no further explanation 
the concert was held in gorky park a spacious area with acres 
of green trees and gardens and one of the most popular outdoor 
spots in moscow it was billed as part of an effort to promote 
peace between the superpowers 
about 18000 young people listened to blaring rhythm from giant 
amplifiers on both sides of the stage as bright colored lights 
flashed overhead even though moscow stays light until about 11 
pm in may on stage performers with spiked dyed hair and 
fluorescent outfits danced with their electric guitars 
this is a festival put on for the reagan visit said leni a 
young russian woman 
there was none of the frenzied behavior common at american 
concerts and no sign of beer alcohol or drugs a lone vendor sold 
juice and bread outside the entrance 
for a group of american students from texas aampm the concert was 
a chance to see their soviet counterparts and enjoy a balmy 
evening people have been very nice to us said laura hauss 
21 of austin texas 
while the soviets were eager to meet americans and trade chewing 
gum for popular lapel pins they were a little cautious about their 
actions 
they are allowed to talk with us but they are still 
reserved said matthew stellges of san antonio texas the texas

moscow although he had read one while a university student the 
bible however is not taught in school 
i have never see a bible in a store anywhere in my life he

the bibles were gone within minutes after they were put on 
display at a booth that also sold religious records a crowd of 
people surrounded the booth pressing to get hold of the book 
each one sold for 35 rubles about 50 
bibles are a rarity in the soviet union where the official 
policy has discouraged religion but soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev recently met with russian orthodox leaders to intensify a 
dialogue between church and state 
bibles were confiscated by customs agents when people attempted 
to bring them into the soviet union

was lost 
except to the finns 
in a policy speech friday in helsinki reagan removed lingering 
doubts about the us regard for neutrality in finland the only 
noncommunist country in europe to sign a friendship treaty with 
the soviet union

jewish refuseniks are planning to demonstrate 
daily during the moscow summit to protest soviet human rights 
policy and the denials of their requests to leave the country 
many wellknown jewish activists have been allowed to emigrate 
from the soviet union under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
leaving behind many others who have applied to leave 
after gorbachev came to power in march 1985 it seemed like 
his reforms would solve the problem said one of the activists 
marina durnovo 
but lately the west has been paying less attention to the 
problems of the activists called refuseniks because they have been 
refused permission to emigrate 
since the summit in washington last december the refusals 
have been pounded down like hail said durnova 
in planning to demonstrate during the summit she said our 
aim is to draw the attention of the soviet and american people to 
the problem of jewish emigration 
the usbased national conference on soviet jewry reported last 
week that 1086 jews were allowed to leave the soviet union in 
april the highest monthly total in nearly seven years 
the figure has been rising for about a year but it falls far 
short of the 1979 levels when the monthly average was about 4000 
departures 
another activist yuri semenovsky said he had conducted a 
survey of some of the estimated 2 million jews in the soviet union 
and concluded that 30 percent of them would like to leave his 
study appeared in the march issue of referendum an independent 
journal published by the press club glasnost a dissident 
organization that tests the limits of gorbachevs reforms 
semenovsky said that 200000 jews had already applied to leave 
the country and that many like himself had been harassed by the 
authorities and forced out of their jobs and that many others were 
afraid to ask 
members of the group disagreed on whether gorbachevs reforms 
had a positive overall effect it is only cosmetic said 
durnova 
semenovsky in contrast said that because of the reforms the 
barrier of fear had been lowered people are not as afraid as they 
were he said attributing the change to gorbachevs policy of 
greater openness 
that same openness however has unleashed forces which some 
jewish activists view with fear the pamyat society a group of 
ardent russian nationalists who have become active under glasnost 
have voiced antisemitic sentiments he said 
semenovskys group has held 15 demonstrations this year and 
during the summit plans three more all at the lenin library in 
downtown moscow at 6 pm some of the demonstrators have been 
detained by police and fined for breaking the law he said 
no members of the group which met with western reporters on the 
eve of president reagans arrival in moscow on sunday were 
scheduled to meet with the president during his stay 
about a dozen jewish activists were included in a group of 
dissidents scheduled to meet with reagan on monday the refuseniks 
said 
among those expected to meet with reagan were yuri and tatyana 
zieman yuli gosharovsky vladimir kislik and his wife bella gulko 
emil lurie benjamen charny igor uspenski his wife ina ioffe 
roald zelichenik yevgeny linein and emil lurie according to yuri

here is the text of president reagans 
weekly radio address saturday 
the remarks were taped monday in washington 
my fellow americans as this pretaped broadcast reaches you 
im in helsinki finland on my way to the soviet union where i 
arrive on sunday 
when i meet in the coming days with soviet general secretary 
gorbachev it will be our fourth set of facetoface talks in three 
years through our conversations ussoviet relations have moved 
forward on the basis of frankness and realism this relationship 
has not rested on any single issue but has been built on a sturdy 
fourpart agenda that includes human rights regional conflicts 
arms reduction and bilateral exchanges 
what has been achieved in this brief span of time offers great 
hope for a brighter future and a safer world 
through western firmness and resolve we concluded the historic 
inf treaty that provides for the global elimination of an entire 
class of us and soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
soviet armed forces are now withdrawing from afghanistan an 
historic event that should lead finally to peace 
selfdetermination and healing for that longsuffering people and 
to an independent and undivided afghan nation 
it is also encouraging to hear general secretary gorbachev speak 
forthrightly about glasnost and perestroika openness and 
restructuring in the soviet union words that to western ears have 
a particularly welcome sound and since he began his campaign we 
can list developments that the free world heartily applauds 
weve seen many wellknown prisoners of conscience released from 
harsh labor camps or strict internal exile courageous people like 
josif begun and andrei sakharov 
soviet authorities have permitted the publication of books like 
dr zhivago and the distribution of movies such as 
repentance that are critical of aspects of the soviet past and 
present 
greater emigration has been allowed greater dissent is being 
tolerated and recently general secretary gorbachev has promised 
to grant a measure of religious freedom to the peoples of the 
soviet union 
all this is new and good but at the same time theres another 
list that the west cannot ignore while there are improvements the 
basic structure of the system has not changed in the soviet union 
or in eastern europe and there remains significant violations of 
human rights and freedoms 
in asia africa and central america unpopular regimes use 
soviet arms to oppress their own people and commit aggression 
against neighboring states these regional conflicts extract a 
terrible toll of suffering and threaten to draw the united states 
and the soviet union into direct confrontation 
these and related concerns will be at the top of my agenda in 
the days ahead i shall say among other things that the soviet 
union should fully honor the helsinki accords in view of that 
document signed in helsinki in 1975 it is difficult to understand 
why almost 13 years later cases of divided families and blocked 
marriages should remain on the eastwest agenda or why soviet 
citizens who wish by right to emigrate should not be able to do so 
and there are other issues the recognition of those who wish to 
practice their religious beliefs and the release of all prisoners 
of conscience 
in working for a safer world and a brighter future for all 
people we know arms agreements alone will not make the world safer 
we must also reduce the reasons for having arms as i said to 
general secretary gorbachev when we first met in 1985 we do not 
mistrust each other because were armed were armed because we 
mistrust each other history has taught us that it is not weapons 
that cause war but the nature and conduct of the governments that 
wield the weapons 
so when we encourage soviet reforms it is with the knowledge 
that democracy not only guarantees human rights but also helps 
prevent war and in truth is a form of arms control 
so really our whole agenda has one purpose to protect peace 
freedom and life itself 
we would like to see positive changes in the ussr 
institutionalized so that theyll become lasting features of soviet 
society and i would like to see more soviet young people come here 
to experience and learn from our society 
and thats why were ready to work with the soviets to praise 
and criticize and work for greater contact and for change 
because that is the path to lasting peace greater freedom and a 
safer world 
im grateful for your prayers and support as i embark on this 
journey until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

michael dukakis is the biggest tax raiser and tax 
cutter in massachusetts history a dual distinction that puts him 
in a curious position as a democratic presidential candidate 
the likely nominee can accurately lay claim to the taxcutter 
title but republican nomineeinwaiting george bush can just as 
correctly claim dukakis is a taxraiser 
the massachusetts governor talks frequently of cutting taxes 
while mopping up republican deficits a pitch aimed at voters 
worried about the federal deficit but dukakis is mindful of 
democratic nominee walter mondales frank 1984 statement that he 
would raise taxes if elected president a promise that contributed 
to his defeat 
in 10 years as governor dukakis has for the most part been 
reluctant to raise taxes although he has done so to the tune of 
500 million and equally reluctant to cut them although he has 
signed tax cuts totaling nearly 710 million 
hes very very gunshy about tax hikes and rather leery about 
tax reductions said richard manley executive director of the 
massachusetts taxpayers foundation 
if elected president dukakis has said new taxes would be a last 
resort bush has backed away from an early campaign promise not to 
raise taxes and adopted a position similar to that of dukakis 
seemingly making taxes a nonissue in the fall campaign 
but bush supporters are closely watching the massachusetts 
legislature where lawmakers are on the verge of sending a 110 
million tax increase package to dukakis desk 
they have just spent themselves into a fiscal mess said 
barbara anderson executive director of citizens for limited 
taxation an antitax lobby founded to oppose dukakis tax 
policies so true to form the first recourse is a tax 
increase 
dukakis became the biggest tax raiser in state history in 1975 
when in his first year as governor he broke a campaign promise not 
to raise taxes 
after months of refusing to break the pledge while the states 
fiscal crisis worsened dukakis relented and the legislature 
approved nearly 500 million in new taxes they included increased 
sales cigarette liquor and estate taxes and a 75 percent income 
tax surcharge 
taxachusetts became the leading nickname for a state with a 
struggling economy and an unemployment rate hovering near 12 
percent 
richard gephardt the missouri representative and former 
democratic candidate tried to use those tax hikes against dukakis 
during the primary campaign bush aides say the vice president is 
considering a similar attack 
but at home even dukakis enemies defend him on the 1975 tax 
hikes widely blamed for his defeat in 1978 
dukakis inherited a 530 million deficit from republican gov 
francis sargent and the state was in danger of defaulting on bond 
issues 
the alternative was to start managing the budget but in all 
fairness he didnt have time said anderson the governors 
fiercest critic on tax and spending policy 
while dukakis was out of office from 19781982 there were minor 
adjustments in the states meal and gasoline taxes and voters 
approved a major property tax cap 
back in office in 1983 dukakis who opposed the property tax 
cap tried unsuccessfully to amend it so that city councils not 
voters would have authority to override it 
after losing that battle dukakis proposed business taxes 
totaling up to 300 million to fund infrastructure projects but 
house leaders refused to support him 
in 1984 a legislative election year dukakis vetoed a 
fouryear 600 million tax cut package that would have increased 
personal exemptions and halved taxes paid by senior citizens on 
unearned income 
at the time the state had a surplus approaching 300 million 
and its budget was growing by nearly 1 billion a year 
but the booming economy and growing surplus sparked a taxcut 
drive dukakis was powerless to stop 
andersons group collected enough signatures to place before 
voters an initiative to repeal the surtax and to impose a state tax 
cap 
dukakis who had consistently opposed repealing the surtax 
agreed to do so and also signed 12 days before the 1986 election 
additional tax cuts increasing personal exemptions and raising 
the maximum income for notax status the governor reelected in a 
landslide opposed the tax cap referendum but it was narrowly 
approved 
we thought we had died and gone to heaven said anderson 
to illustrate the change consider the state tax burden in 
fiscal 1977 massachusetts residents paid 177 in state and local 
taxes and fees per 1000 of income 9 percent above the national 
average of 162 in contrast in fiscal 1986 the massachusetts tax 
and fee burden was 150 per 1000 of income 57 percent below the 
national average of 159 
although dukakis opposed the majority of the tax cuts he now 
touts them in campaign speeches and ads 
anderson and other critics are crying foul 
in every instance he opposed cutting taxes until he was 
carried kicking and screaming with his feet to the fire and forced 
to do so said royall switzler a former house republican leader 
what hes saying now is all blue smoke and mirrors 
but others say dukakis has been careful not to claim direct 
responsibility for the tax cuts 
he took the heat for the 1975 tax hike that wasnt his fault 
so why shouldnt he take some credit for the tax cuts said 
manley 
hes a guy who has signed tax cuts and proposed tax 
increases said martin linsky a republican who served with 
dukakis in the legslature in the 1960s and now teaches at harvards 
john f kennedy school of government 
i think the line between putting the best face on things and 
misrepresentation is not a line of science linsky said its a 
line of art and thats what the campaign will be about

police arrested 35 people at an isolated 
farmhouse and discovered indications of satanic ritual along with 
piles of money an arms cache and a corpse bearing signs of 
mafiastyle execution newspapers said saturday 
we still dont know how much the mafia and black magic were 
involved in this affair investigating magistrate luigi belvedere 
was quoted as saying in the paese sera newspaper 
the raid was ordered after a man showed up wednesday night at a 
hospital in this southern city he was suffering from gunshot 
wounds and said he had been involved in a bizarre religious ritual 
following the tip police went to the farmhouse and found 35 
young people holding hands and murmuring hail mary around a 
table with a picture of the virgin mary and one of antonio 
naccarato on the floor lay a dismembered cat 
naccarato who died in 1983 was a southern italian who sought 
work in the northern city of turin and was regarded by some as a 
saint and healer newspapers reported 
the worshipers reportedly took no notice of the police and would 
only say i am an apostle of christ 
the police knocked down a metal door and found the corpse of a 
27yearold man who had been shot to death a few days earlier 
police said the victim was bound in a way that the ndrangheta 
the calabrian version of the mafia reserves for traitors 
the body was surrounded by 18 rifles guns knives thousands of 
bullets and nearly 800000 in cash and checks 
lidia naccarato 36 the niece of antonio naccarato was one of 
those arrested police said she was found in a trancelike state in 
a room adjacent to the ceremony and denied knowing anything about 
the dead body

today it was willing to discuss some of the political reforms the 
rebels are demanding as a condition for ending the 6yearold

talks through the weekend but the rebel leaders refused and said 
they had to leave by the end of the day

proposals from the usbacked rebels known as contras these 
included calls for political pluralism equality before the law 
the right to strike and a pluralistic electoral system 
the government offer reworked contra demands for the separation 
of state powers and the elimination of the state identification 
with the ruling sandinista national liberation front 
the sandinista negotiators also offered to discuss norms and 
guarantees for the functioning of a system of mixed economy 
including the different forms of ownership 
all of this ortega said would be discussed in a national 
dialogue after a permanent ceasefire takes effect 
ortega said there had been considerable progress made during 
the talks 
we are going to the meeting hoping we can persuade them 
ortega told reporters 
the negotiators were expected to agree on an extension of a 
temporary ceasefire paving the way for further peace talks at a 
future meeting 
luis rivas leiva a member of the contra delegation said there 
were only five minor points to discuss in dealing with the 
procedures for the truce extension and administration of areas 
where the rebels have been gathered since the start of a twomonth 
ceasefire that truce ends monday 
then we can go on to discuss the more difficult aspects of the 
political topics he said 
he said that would include the political conditions demanded by 
the contras for them to return to the political life of the 
country and a permanent ceasefire 
contra leaders on friday rejected a government proposal to 
continue the latest round of peace talks past todays deadline and 
said an agreement could be signed immediately if the leftist 
government really wanted one 
meanwhile one of the bestknown commanders of the usbacked 
contra rebels ended his struggle against the sandinista government 
and said he would encourage his troops to do the same 
felix garcia hernandez known as alfa lima told reporters 
friday that before he sought amnesty he commanded more than 400 
contra fighters in the central chontales region of nicaragua 
alfa limas action was the latest in a series of political 
defeats suffered by the beleaguered guerrillas 
alfa lima abandoned the rebel force with six of his men on 
wednesday he said he hoped to encourage more of his former 
comrades to take advantage of the amnesty 
i am going to try to convince my men to come in there are 
many out there who do not know what they are doing or why they are 
fighting said the softspoken alfa lima still wearing his 
camouflage uniform 
alfa limas former commanderinchief enrique bermudez in 
managua for the peace talks said he regretted the officers 
decision 
he was a field commander with a long record we consider him a 
war casualty bermudez said

the national safety council may be best known for 
its grim projections of highway death tolls on holiday weekends 
but its leaders wince at their perceived role as body counters 
the councils warnings about the risks of holiday travel are 
just a small part of its publiceducation effort to save lives and 
prevent accidents by making americans more careful said tc 
gilchrest the organizations president 
the mission is the same as when the council was founded 75 years 
ago by representatives of industry railroads and insurance 
companies concerned about the loss of lives and production 
we try to reduce what is unacceptable gilchrest said last 
week of the publicservice organization a notforprofit 
nongovernmental group 
and the council considers it unacceptable that in 1986 there 
were more than 90000 accidental deaths and 89 million disabling 
injuries in the united states at a cost to the economy of about 
118 billion 
no accident is a function of fate or providence said 
gilchrest every accident is a function of carelessness that 
could be prevented 
the council has 12400 member organizations including 
businesses schools and private groups and works with about 100 
affiliated local safety councils 
membership fees account for about 15 percent of its 29 million 
annual budget according to council vice president melinda thomas 
most of the balance is generated by safetyconsulting services 
defensive driver courses and other instruction programs and 
materials 
gilchrest said the council has changed with the times to go 
beyond its traditional industrial and traffic safety concerns 
getting involved in such issues as aids prevention and drug abuse 
but consumer advocate ralph nader said the council remains too 
much under the influence of industry avoiding critical studies on 
workplace safety that might offend corporate members 
the council spends a lot of time on human miscues handling 
machines and not enough on badly designed consumer products and 
workplace machinery that abuse consumers and workers said nader 
in a telephone interview from washington dc 
gilchrest said he takes pride in the councils reputation as 
an honest broker on safety issues he said the council takes a 
positive approach that puts greater emphasis on saving lives than 
on finger pointing 
with workplace accidents costing us industry about 348 
billion in 1986 he said companies understand safety is better 
business the loss estimates are based on wage losses medical 
expenses insurance costs property damage money value of time 
lost on the job and other factors 
the nations accidental death rate has dropped 52 percent in the 
past 75 years from 82 per 100000 population in 1912 to 39 per 
100000 in 1986 but rates are lower in japan and many western 
european countries 
in terms of safety america is a thirdrate country said 
james tye director general of the british safety council in london 
five years ago when gilchrest became president the council 
faced criticism from members who said it was not measuring up to 
its 1953 charter from congress designating it as the agency to lead 
the fight against accidents gilchrest said 
the council is taking stands on issues it might have ducked 
previously said gilchrest 
last month its representatives opposed raising the national 
speed limit from 55 to 65 mph in testimony before a house 
committee saying the lower limit had saved about 90000 lives 
since 1973 
the council also supports mandatory air bags in cars and smoking 
bans on commercial airline flights 
the council said it compiles its body counts to make people 
more careful and to try to reduce the number of holiday traffic 
deaths which often are about 10 percent higher than fatalities 
during a normal weekend 
before each holiday weekend the council estimates traffic 
deaths based on an analysis of traffic patterns factoring in such 
variables as actual recent death counts and legislation that could 
have an impact on motorists behavior 
the council projects 380 to 480 people will die in traffic 
accidents this weekend as opposed to 390 who would be expected to 
die in three days on a nonholiday weekend

for 43 years charles w lindberg has 
looked at photos of himself and five other marines raising an 
american flag on iwo jima in the prelude to one of the most 
celebrated moments of world war ii 
lindberg was part of the first flagraising on the tiny japanese 
island an event few know about besides the men who were there 
about four hours later a second flag was hoisted on mount 
suribachi that moment was immortalized by associated press 
photographer joe rosenthal in a pulitzer prizewinning photo 
lindberg wasnt part of the photo but hes not jealous of those 
who were 
id rather be in this one than i would the second this is a 
true picture said lindberg pointing to himself in one of his 
many photos of the first flagraising ours is the genuine 
thing 
lindberg 67 a retired electrician lives with his wife 
violet in a minneapolis suburb he has a roomful of books photos 
and mementos of iwo jima 
the grand forks nd native enlisted in the marines in january 
1942 at age 21 three years later a corporal lindberg went to iwo 
jima as a member of the 28th regiment of the 5th marine division 
iwo jima only eight miles square was a strategic piece of land 
750 miles south of tokyo and the united states wanted it to 
support longrange b29 bombers and a possible invasion of japan 
on feb 19 1945 30000 marines landed on the southeast coast 
more than 6800 us servicemen died in the fiveweek battle that 
followed and the 21000man japanese defense force was virtually 
wiped out 
lindbergs squad was in the spearhead of the attack on 
suribachi at 546 feet the highest point on the island it wasnt 
far from the beach where the marines landed but it took four days 
to climb 
lindberg remembers the feb 23 flagraising as if it were 
yesterday 
when we reached the top of that mountain about 1030 in the 
morning we thought we were going to be in a lot of trouble 
lindberg said 
first thing was get the flag up a couple of guys found a 
water pipe up there they had water systems i guess we tied the 
flag to that pole and we carried it to the tallest place we could 
find and we raised it 
it was the first time an american flag had flown over japanese 
territory lou lowery a photographer for the marine magazine 
leatherneck took pictures of the men raising the flag on a 20foot 
pole 
thats when everything broke loose he said the troops 
down below began to cheer and ship whistles out in the bay began 
to toot i tell you it just made you shiver all over i dont know 
if it was pride or patriotism or what it was what a feeling that 
was ill never forget that 
but right away boom i think the japanese started to come out 
of the caves lindberg said so then we had to go after them 
right away 
lt col chandler w johnson ordered another larger flag 
meanwhile rosenthal was climbing the mountain in an interview 
from his san francisco home rosenthal 76 remembered how he ran 
into lowery coming down 
lowery laughed and said i already got pictures up there you 
guys are late 
rosenthal kept going and bullets were still flying when he 
captured the prizewinning image of five marines and a navy medical 
corpsman driving the new flag into the ground 
his lowerys photo was 10 times more arduous to get than 
mine rosenthal said there may be some question which of the 
two of us is the better photographer however there can be no 
doubt which of us is luckier 
of the six marines who raised the original flag only lindberg 
1st lt harold schrier and pfc james michaels returned from the 
bloody battle alive 
lindbergs war ended on march 1 when a bullet shattered his 
right forearm 
sgt ernest thomas sgt henry hansen and pfc louis charlo died 
on the island schrier died in the 1970s michaels two years ago 
and lowery died last year lindberg said 
that makes lindberg the sole surviving member of the crew 
i think it was quite a thing to be what i did but you never 
do it alone lindberg said

with no chance of an agreement on strategic arms 
american officials are focusing on other issues they hope will make 
president reagans trip to moscow more than just a travelogue 
when the moscow summit the fourth between reagan and soviet 
communist party general secretary mikhail gorbachev was set late 
last year both sides were optimistic they could sign a treaty 
reducing longrange nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent 
but the negotiations are far from complete snagged on 
verification and the us strategic defense initiative among other 
things 
among the other issues to be discussed during the moscow summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
reagan and gorbachev had been expected to sign two protocols in 
moscow dealing with underground nuclear explosions but us 
officials on saturday said the agreements may not be ready both 
are designed to improve monitoring procedures 
a ussoviet treaty signed in 1974 limits underground blasts 
the only nuclear explosions still legal to 150 kilotons at the 
summit the two leaders are likely to set the ground rules for 
joint experiments in nevada and in semipalatinsk in july and august 
to measure the force of detonations 
the americans prefer a system known as cortex which involves 
inserting a cable in a shaft about 30 feet from the test and taking 
measurements from it while the soviets like the seismic system 
used for earthquakes 
both systems will be used at the us and soviet tests 
a 1976 treaty set the same 150kiloton ceiling for socalled 
peaceful blasts these are nuclear explosions to change the courses 
of rivers or for other nonmilitary purposes the united states 
wants to be able to monitor blasts above the 50kiloton level 
neither side now engages in such testing 
still reagan has said if verification measures to guard against 
cheating are improved he would submit the unratified treaties to 
the senate for approval

top us officials say the summit will give both sides an 
opportunity to review where we are regarding conventional 
weapons in europe but a bilateral accord is unlikely because of 
ongoing negotiations in vienna between the countries of the warsaw 
pact and nato alliance there have been hints that gorbachev might 
unilaterally withdraw 50000 to 100000 troops from eastern europe 
to gain a public relations advantage in the negotiations 
moscow has conceded for the first time that it has an advantage 
over the west in some military categories the pentagon estimates 
the soviets have 230 divisions in eastern europe compared to 121 
for nato 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like conventional arms the issue of chemical weapons is the 
subject of multilateral treaty negotiations under way in geneva 
hence the united states is reluctant to sign anything although 
the issue will be raised 
the soviets have been pressing the united states to endorse a 
sweeping ban on lethal chemical weapons but us officials say 
that push is politically motivated what the united states wants is 
a truly global chemical weapons agreement that can be verified 
assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway said 
the soviets have agreed to join the verification process but 
they havent filed the necessary plans to safeguard against 
cheating us officials estimate the soviets have 300000 tons of 
chemical weapons about six times the us amount

the future of afghanistan will be raised even though the soviets 
have agreed to withdraw from the country under a un agreement 
signed this spring specifically at issue is the fate of 5 million 
refugees living in pakistan and iran 
the top regional issue however is angola where us and soviet 
officials have been trying to arrange a withdrawal of 40000 cuban 
troops from the country withdrawal would have to be accompanied by 
implementation of us resolution 435 calling for an end to the 
south african occupation of namibia 
otherwise the united states wants the soviets to stop selling 
weapons to iran in the gulf war and to pressure vietnam to remove 
its troops from cambodia 
on the mideast the soviets want a fullblown international 
peace conference to reach a settlement while the united states 
favors a mostly ceremonial conference that would lead to bilateral 
talks between israel and its arab neighbors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the two sides hope to arrive at a threeyear agreement on 
educational and cultural exchanges extending the accord signed at 
geneva in november 1985 the exchanges monitored by the us 
information agency have mushroomed as americans and soviets seek 
to learn more about each other through visits and study but the 
exchanges are still lopsided with many more americans visiting the 
soviet union than vice versa under the agreements high school and 
college students have traveled abroad and entertainers from both 
countries have toured

reagan can be expected to broach the human rights issue 
particularly the plight of thousands of soviet jews who have been

imprisoned in the hospitals the soviets would carry out reciprocal

morocco is making so much headway 
winning people over in this longdisputed territory that it no 
longer fears a referendum on independence among the inhabitants 
exemption from taxes and import duties development projects and 
an apparently unlimited supply of fresh water most precious of 
all commodities in the desert have helped undermine the support 
once enjoyed by the polisario independence movement 
the hardest blow suffered by polisario which algeria supports 
was the announcement may 17 that algeria and morocco had restored 
diplomatic relations after 12 years of hovering on the brink of war 
over the sahara 
algeria had pledged not to renew relations until morocco granted 
independence to the territory 
the moroccan army took foreign reporters on a fiveday tour of 
the 110000squaremile wilderness allowing them to set their own 
itinerary and talk with inhabitants at random without military 
escort 
nomadic tribes of the former spanish colony paid allegiance to 
the sultans of morocco for centuries and morocco annexed the 
territory after spain withdrew in 1975 
polisario a marxistled movement that is armed financed and 
supplied by algeria began fighting from algerian sanctuaries and 
at one time virtually overran the moroccan defenders 
its guerrillas have been unable to breach a 1500mile wall of 
sand and rock that morocco erected but defending it has cost the 
moroccans nearly 10000 men dead or wounded and an estimated 400 
million a year much of it donated by saudi arabia 
inhabitants of the region estimated at 76000 by the spanish 
colonial administration have fled to the moroccanheld cities or 
to refugee camps around tindouf an algerian oasis about 500 miles 
south of casablanca 
the united nations is trying to arrange a referendum among 
original inhabitants and their offspring on whether they want 
moroccan rule or independence 
king hassan ii proposed the referendum in 1981 moroccan 
officials say polisarios increasing reluctance to accept a 
unsupervised referendum is a measure of the movements loss of 
support among the population 
reporters saw no sign of polisario activity or support 
saharan workers in the bou craa phosphate mines saharan 
fishermen in dakhla port 800 miles south of casablanca 
shopkeepers in el ayoun the territorial capital and nomads with 
their herds of camels and goats all expressed promoroccan feelings 
and loyalty to hassan 
pictures of the monarch were displayed in their tents the king 
is both political and religious leader of morocco 
mohamed ould mbarek 65 has pitched his tent 25 miles west of 
bou craa he sold twothirds of his 100 camels to buy two 
apartments in el ayoun for his two wives so his children can go to 
the new moroccanrun schools there 
asked how he felt about polisario the graybearded bedouin 
clutched the engraved silver handle of his dagger and said angrily 
if they come here i will kill them 
in el ayoun trader mohamed khaddad said one of his eight sons 
was with the polisario in tindouf he said there had been no word 
from him in eight years and declared 
if he ever comes back i will tell him he is a traitor to his 
country and his king i pray that god may give me the strength to 
forgive him one day 
salah zemrag governor of el ayoun province said morocco has 
built schools hospitals highways artesian wells and more than 
18000 homes in the town which was little more than a military 
outpost when the spanish left 
fadli rguibi 38 is among hundreds of former polisario 
guerrillas who moroccan officials say fled across the desert from 
algeria in recent months as morale declined and camp conditions 
worsened 
of the people in the tindouf refugee camps rguibi said they 
are carefully watched and spied on they are afraid to talk freely 
among each other because anyone could be an informer but you cant 
suppress the truth forever everyone long suspected the war was 
lost only the leaders still seemed to believe in it 
polisario originally claimed the western sahara had 1 million 
inhabitants most of them in and around tindouf but now says only 
165000 refugees live in the algerian camps morocco says most are 
not saharans 
rguibi said the guerrillas number fewer than 10000 
in aousserd a desolate volcanic crater outpost 125 miles 
southeast of dakhla the reporters were taken by helicopter to a 
strongpoint on the wall 
moroccan soldiers manned french american and czechoslovakmade 
artillery and machine guns overlooking the wide empty plain 
leading into neighboring mauritania the red greenstarred 
moroccan flag fluttered overhead 
gen abdelaziz bennani commander of moroccan forces in the 
sahara said the wall was manned by 80000 men more than half the 
moroccan army equipped with sophisticated weapons and radar 
sensors 
our equipment is so sensitive he said that we recently 
picked out a truck with four tourists who lost their way in the 
desert from more than 25 miles away 
he said the guerrillas last attacked the wall jan 30 in a 
hitandrun raid without causing moroccan casualties or getting 
near the moroccan defenses 
their claims of almost daily attacks are sheer fantasy he 
said

the special un envoy for afghan 
refugees urged the united states and soviet union on saturday to 
help repair the destruction wrought in afghanistan by a decade of 
civil war 
i extend an appeal to reagan and gorbachev that they come 
together and give the united nations multilateral means to restore 
the country that has been virtually destroyed by 10 years of 
warfare prince sadruddin aga khan said on a oneday visit to the 
afghan capital 
president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev the soviet leader 
begin a summit sunday in moscow sadruddin urged the leaders to use 
the summit to support un humanitarian programs in afghanistan 
sadruddin said a successful humanitarian aid program could be 
the key to peace in afghanistan where moslem guerrillas began 
fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 soviet soldiers who 
entered the country in december 1979 began withdrawing may 15 
under an agreement mediated by the united nations 
the prince warned against a hasty return of more than 5 million 
afghan refugees who fled to neighboring pakistan and iran to escape 
the war 
it would be very tragic if people were to rush back in a 
disorganized way sadruddin said at the end of his day in kabul 
the first stop on a tour that will include pakistan and iran 
we have to prepare for the refugees return he said if 
they have no life support system no crops no food no shelter 
there will be very little hope of encouraging voluntary return 
what can be done in afghan humanitarian assistance today can be the 
glue for peace 
sadruddin was un high commissioner for refugees in the 1970s 
he is the uncle of the aga khan hereditary leader of the ismaili 
sect of islam which has adherents in pakistan and afghanistan as 
well as other asian and middle eastern nations 
the sound of artillery fire boomed across the mountains girding 
kabul a few minutes before his news conference at the airport 
he did not set a timetable or a cost for returning the refugees 
to afghanistan 
four days before the soviet withdrawal began sadruddin was 
named the un special coordinator for humanitarian and economic 
assistance to afghanistan 
during his brief time in kabul he met afghan leader najib and 
new prime minister hasan sharq who has led afghanistans efforts 
to repatriate refugees 
accompanying the prince were representatives of the red cross 
and the red crescent its islamic equivalent and of several un 
agencies including world health organization and unicef the un 
childrens fund 
un programs for refugees must be free of political strings 
and should not be used as a weapon sadruddin said 
the united states has supplied weapons to afghan guerrillas 
operating from bases in pakistan and has reserved the right to do 
so as long as the soviet union supplies the afghan army 
if all afghan refugees living abroad return home it will be the 
biggest repatriation in un history about onethird of 
afghanistans prewar population now lives outside the country 
according to figures cited by un official geneva last month 
there are 31 million afghan refugees in pakistan and 24 million 
in iran

president reagan the target of 
embarrassing disclosures in books by former aides says he probably 
will write a book of his own to straighten out the record and 
tell things as they really are 
however the president indicated he wasnt happy about the idea 
i dont look forward to it i wrote a book once and found it 
was quite a chore said reagan the author of a 1965 
autobiography entitled wheres the rest of me 
reagan revealed his plans in a televised interview with two 
soviet journalists broadcast saturday night in the soviet union 
after being taped last week in the oval office 
ive been thinking very seriously about writing a book in 
view of the fact that several people who have left government have 
written some books i think maybe i better straighten out the 
record and tell things as they really are reagan said 
he said the presidential library to be built in southern 
california after he leaves office will house the papers and 
memorabilia that he collected 
so there will be a record that is open for public view but 
ill probably get around to writing a book 
for the record a recent book by former white house chief of 
staff donald t regan portrayed reagan as a handoff leader whose 
schedule was guided by astrological forecasts followed by his wife 
nancy 
former white house spokesman larry speakes also drew an 
unflattering portrait of reagan in his book speaking out and 
said he made up quotes for the president at the geneva summit with 
gorbachev because reagan was losing the public relations battle 
speakes said he also took words from secretary of state george 
p shultz and attributed them to reagan after the soviet union shot 
down a korean airliner speakes said reagan didnt have anything to 
say on his own at meetings with key aides

the gasoline tank on a church bus that 
erupted into flames after being hit headon by a pickup truck was 
ruptured by a piece of the buss springs a published report says 
twentyseven people mostly teenagers were killed in the may 
14 disaster on interstate 71 near carrollton the driver of the 
pickup larry w mahoney 34 has pleaded innocent to 27 counts of 
murder in the case 
in its friday editions the kentucky post of covington quoted an 
unidentified source as saying the leafspring assembly broke loose 
from the buss frame causing a 3inch gash in the gas tank the 
leafspring assembly is a shock absorber built on curved strips of 
metal 
the newspaper quoted the source as saying that a protective cage 
required on modern buses might not have prevented the tragedy 
if the tank had been in a cage as now required on similar 
buses the puncture and ensuing fire might have happened a fraction 
of a second sooner the source said i dont believe a cage 
would have prevented the gash 
alan pollock a spokesman for the national transportation safety 
board in washington dc confirmed that investigators found a 
3inch gash in the tank of the first assembly of god bus he would 
not say whether they have linked the puncture to the leaf spring 
assembly 
meanwhile the state police traffic accident report on the 
disaster was filed friday but the 20page report does not say what 
caused the gash in the gas tank 
state police capt neal brittain said some details of the wreck 
are not known he said he could not discuss a cause of the 
explosion simply because we cant at this time 
he said a detailed reconstruction of the wreck will follow in a 
supplemental report in two to three weeks 
we want to make sure everything done in the reconstruction is 
accurate he said 
the newspaper quoted its source as saying the reconstruction 
indicates the bus driver turned to the left to avoid the pickup and 
was hit on the right corner by the door 
a lefthand curve lay just ahead of the bus a night vision test 
indicated the bus driver probably was not aware of the pickup until 
the vehicles were about 350 feet apart the newspaper said 
at 350 feet the drivers of vehicles traveling toward each at 60 
mph would have approximately two seconds to react according to the 
report 
the speed of the two vehicles has not been revealed by the 
safety board or the state police

here are excerpts from the interview 
that president reagan gave soviet journalists for broadcast in the 
soviet union in advance of the moscow summit 
the text of the interview which was conducted before reagan 
left washington was released saturday by the white house staff in 
helsinki questions were translated from russian 
q mr president you are about to visit moscow this will be 
your first trip to our country with what feelings do you travel to 
the soviet union and what do you expect at your next summit 
reagan well this will be the fourth meeting between the 
general secretary and myself i am obviously looking forward to the 
trip for one reason because i have never been there and im 
looking forward to seeing your country and well as much as is 
possible with the meetings that will be going on and we have 
discussed in the previous meetings with your general secretary such 
matters as arms reductions and weve been successful on the one 
treaty we are both working on the present treaty that we call 
start the 50 percent reduction of intercontinental ballistic 
missiles but also some differences that weve had on our 
interpretation of human rights on regional affairs and we are 
greatly heartened by the fact that your forces are withdrawing from 
afghanistan and on bilateral issues such things as rescue at sea 
agreements fisheries agreements things of that kind in which 
weve made great progress 
q what is your view for the possibility for further advancement 
toward peace 
reagan well i have to be optimistic about it i have read 
perestroika covertocover and the goals that were outlined 
there for your own country and by your present leader were such 
that i think it would reduce some of the differences between us 
further and make it possible for future leaders of our countries 
to eliminate the well what i called for in the in our first 
meeting in geneva when just the general secretary and i were 
talking to each other i pointed out that we didnt mistrust each 
other because we were armed were armed because we mistrust each 
other and that we had a unique opportunity the two of us to go 
to work not just to try and reduce arms but to reduce the causes 
of the mistrust 
q mr president an opinion is forming in moscow that it 
would hardly be possible to sign a treaty on the 50 percent 
reduction of strategic nuclear weapons while observing the inf 
treaty and what is your perspective on the completion of such an 
agreement that would further peace 
reagan well i still think it can be concluded but it would 
be i think overly optimistic with the time limitations to believe 
that it could be ready for signature as the inf treaty was here in 
the previous meeting but were going to continue negotiating 
q do you believe that it will be signed this treaty 
reagan yes i do i dont think either of us have gone this far 
with the idea that it wasnt a good idea 
 
q could you at the beginning of your presidency when you had 
just entered the oval office imagine the possibility of your 
upcoming visit to moscow 
reagan probably not because very frankly i have to say i 
think there is a difference between this general secretary and 
other leaders of your country that i have met with in the past i 
dont think they had any dreams of perestroika and yet i felt 
that we had to exist in the world together our systems are 
different were going to be competitive in a number of ways and 
thatll continue but we can be competitive without being hostile 
to the point of conflict with each other and i think this is what 
were aiming at and no i could not have foreseen your present 
leader 
q well new times bring new leaders 
reagan yes 
q is it possible to conclude that you expect that your 
successor will continue the course of stabilization of 
sovietamerican relations that there will not be a break in the 
dialogue between our countries 
reagan well if the next president is the president i would 
like to see there the present vice president i know he would 
continue on this track but i think that our people want this i 
had a visit just the other day here in the white house with 78 
young teenagers and half of them were from the soviet union and 
half were students of ours and you looked out at those young 
people and you couldnt say well those are russians and those 
are americans you just saw young people who had learned to know 
each other exchange ideas and get acquainted and i found myself 
saying to them if all the young people of the world could get to 
know each other thered never be another war 
 
q the majority of presidents in this country at the end of 
their term of office write their memoirs are you preparing to 
write your memoirs and when can we if so get a chance to read 
them 
reagan well ive been thinking very seriously about writing a 
book in view of the fact that several people who have left 
government have written some books i think maybe id better 
straighten out the record and tell things as they really are and 
so its possible i will 
q since our time is up more or less id like to thank you for 
the interview and wish you great success in the future 
reagan well thank you very much may i just say one thing 
also in getting to your country and i would relish the 
opportunity if i could to say a few words here that is never 
discussed very much i have a great admiration for the women of the 
soviet union particularly in the russian area from the outside 
looking they seem to be a great bulwark of strength and solidity 
in the maintaining of the home in the things that they stand for 
the standing in lines to bring home what is necessary for the 
family and all of that and i just wonder if theyre getting the 
credit within your country that i think they deserve 
q they do deserve it but they dont just stand in lines the 
overwhelming majority of them work together with men 
reagan yes 
q and i hope you will be able with your own eyes to see 
all of this when you come to our country 
reagan well youve said it better than i did but yes i 
recognize all of those things and just wondered if they get the 
recognition they deserve within their own country

the arms control treaty president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev came close to 
agreeing to in raiseyouone negotiations in iceland is on the 
table again in moscow still enticing and still elusive 
but us officials do not expect reagan to engage this time in 
impromptu derringdo headtohead negotiating with gorbachev of 
the sort they partook in at reykjavik in october 1986 
the united states and the soviet union have been negotiating 
off and on since 1982 on a strategic arms reduction treaty known 
as start the united states proposed a 30 percent cut in both 
nations stockpiles of longrange nuclear weapons the soviet union 
countered by proposing 50 percent 
but us officials said saturday that prospects for further 
progress in moscow had dimmed because a prospective 
confidencebuilding measure due to be approved there had fallen 
through 
assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway said the soviets 
had turned down a us proposal for prenotification of missile 
test launches 
she did not explain why the tentative agreement to notify each 
other before missiles test launchings had fallen through 
mrs ridgway indicated the soviets wanted a more sweeping 
confidencebuilding measure that was unacceptable to the united 
states 
it looked for a moment like gorbachev and reagan might have a 
deal or at least agreement at the top on the framework for a deal 
when they met in iceland 
but reagans dream of a spacebased missile defense system 
star wars proved too great a stumbling block 
gorbachev wanted testing limited to the laboratory reagan 
wanted real world testing they could not agree and parted in 
disappointment start went back to geneva where both sides have 
been negotiating 
now it appears too late for a start agreement soviet officials 
say more than 1200 points of disagreement exist 
the issue is awesomely complex especially the question of 
verification strategic weapons can be delivered by bombers or 
missiles 
missiles can be fired from land planes ships or submarines 
landfired missiles can be launched from fixed sites or movable 
sites mobile missiles systems of which the soviets have two and 
the united states have none 
the two sides are unable to find acceptable ways to verify 
cutbacks in such easily hidden systems 
another issue is whether a start agreement would ban existing or 
future intercontinental ballistic missile systems 
on top of that reagans star wars program remains a seemingly 
insurmountable obstacle the soviets want to restrict tests in 
space and will not agree to cuts in offensive weapons unless they 
can call the reductions off if they conclude star wars violates the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
its now clear there is no way these questions can be shaped 
up in treaty form in time for the summit secretary of state 
george p shultz said may 12 in geneva switzerland after winding 
up presummit talks with his soviet counterpart foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
that being the case us officials do no expect reagan to try 
to bridge the gap in facetoface talks with gorbachev 
at their first summit in geneva in 1985 the two leaders spent 
time alone in front of a roaring fireplace and then walking 
outside in the snappy swiss fall air 
the informality of the arrangement with only their interpreters 
present helped break the ice 
as they strolled back from a conversation in a garden gazebo 
gorbachev accepted reagans proposal for annual summit meetings 
apparently that was the only time in their three summit meetings 
that oneonone sessions produced a substantive result 
at their second summit in reykjavik reagan was alone with 
gorbachev for about 25 minutes mostly discussing human rights 
when they turned to the detailed issue of arms control and 
swapped proposals that escalated until it seemed there would be a 
breakthrough in the arms race reagan had shultz at his side 
reykjavik did set the stage for the treaty signed by reagan and 
gorbachev last december in washington to eliminate all us and 
soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
in washington reagan and gorbachev were alone for about a 
halfhour again the subject was human rights 
in moscow apart from the opening night dinner reagans program 
calls for two private sessions with gorbachev 
the first will be in the kremlin shortly after the president 
arrives from helsinki finland a gorbachev greeting is all that is 
anticipated on reagans third day in moscow they will be alone 
again 
us officials said saturday that in fact it now seems 
unlikely the two sides will sign protocols in moscow calling for 
experiments to establish more thorough means of verifying two 
treaties that have been agreed upon but never verified by the 
senate although experts believe both sides are adhering to them 
these are the threshhold test ban treaty signed on july 3 1974 
and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty signed may 28 1976 
banning nuclear tests greater than 150 kilotons more than 100 
times more powerful than the hiroshima bomb in world war ii 
lt gen colin powell the presidents national security 
adviser said two agreements on monitoring underground nuclear test 
explosions were not likely to be ready for reagan and gorbachev to 
approve 
the first deals with trying out us and soviet measuring 
devices at test explosions in july and augustthe joint experiments 
in nevada and at semipalatinsk apparently will proceed in july and 
august 
but powell said that a few technical issues have to be 
resolved the second protocol deals with socalled peaceful test 
explosions powell said negotiators were having difficulty 
reconciling the russian and english versions 
reagan has said he would submit the 1974 and 1976 treaties to 
the senate for ratification if verification measures were improved 
it was not clear if the setback in summit plans would affect his 
plan 
gorbachev in a grand gesture may announce the unilateral 
withdrawal of 50000 to 100000 forwardbased soviet troops in 
europe in an effort to spur agreement on a reduction of both sides 
conventional forces in europe 
western experts say the soviet bloc has a 21 advantage over the 
west in conventional forces the mutual and balanced force 
reduction talks went on for 14 years without producing agreement 
finally the superpowers may agree on ways to bring about a 
worldwide ban on chemical weapons forty nations are negotiating at 
the united nations committee on disarmament on a ban but the talks 
are stalled over the intrusive verification measures that would be 
required to assure compliance these weapons can be manufactured in 
ordinary chemical factories without attracting attention

president reagan in an interview 
broadcast saturday in the soviet union said he had great 
admiration for soviet women and wondered if they were getting 
enough credit for running their homes and standing in store lines 
his comment drew an immediate response from a soviet 
interviewer who said women do more than housework but also work 
in administrative posts teach and perform other duties 
the exchange came at the end of an unusual interview in the oval 
office last week at the invitation of the white house two soviet 
television journalists flew to washington from moscow and asked 
reagan questions for half an hour

of 200 million in the soviet union 
as the inteviewers thanked reagan for his time the president 
asked to say one more thing 
i would relish the opportunity to say a few words here that is 
never discussed very much reagan said 
i have a great admiration for the women of the soviet union 
particularly in the russian area 
from the outside looking in they seem to be a great bulwark 
of strength and solidity in the maintaining of the home and the 
things that they stand for the standing in lines to bring home

and i just wonder if theyre getting the credit within your

authorities foiled a plan saturday 
to smuggle 264 asians mostly tamils to canada aboard a ship a 
police spokesman said 
police were looking for a 38yearold tamil suspected of 
organizing the trip according to spokesman bernd metterhausen the 
suspect who was not identified is believed to have arranged a 
similar passage of tamils to canada nearly two years ago 
metterhausen told reporters 
metterhausen said police discovered the plan shortly before the 
asians were supposed to board a ship in hamburgs harbor early 
saturday they were found in an abandoned hotel in hittfeld near 
the northern port 
a patrol of plainclothesmen noticed a suspiciouslooking column 
of two limousines and a truck driving through hamburg the police 
spokesman said they followed the convoy and discovered the group 
in the abandoned building 
the building was full to the roof with asylum seekers 
metterhausen said 
authorities suspected the tamil organizer of pocketing about 
2900 for each refugee 
the group consisted of 257 tamils five indians and two 
bengalis he said 
documents in the three vehicles revealed that the group was 
supposed to board the lupa a west germanregistered ship 
police searched the ship and arrested its owner and captain he 
was being questioned but denied any role in the smuggling plan 
police said 
metterhausen said police had received several tips in recent 
weeks that there were plans to smuggle a large number of tamils to 
canada police had noticed a larger than usual presence of tamils 
in hamburg in recent days he said 
in august 1986 155 tamils were taken by ship from west germany 
and abandoned in lifeboats off the coast of newfoundland they were 
rescued by canadian officials and permitted to stay 
west germany is host to about 30000 tamil refugees who have 
fled civil strife in sri lanka where tamil rebels are fighting for 
a separate nation 
the refugees discovered saturday were placed under care of the 
red cross metterhausen said 
they will be sent back to the west german towns where they

the reagan administrations failed effort to 
induce panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega to surrender power 
was riddled with blunders and miscalculations according to a 
number of independent experts 
but while many of the experts found fault with the way the 
administration handled the negotiations they had few ideas on what 
the united states can do now to achieve its goals of an apolitical 
military and restoring constitutional rule in panama 
were in for the long haul said eva loser of the center for 
strategic and international studies 
to some experts the united states looked both foolish and weak 
after noriega refused last wednesday to sign on to a usbrokered 
package deal that called for his resignation in august and 
temporary departure from panama while an election process took 
place 
i think that whats happened is weve really seen the limits 
of us intervention said douglas bandow of the cato institute 
and despite the fact that were a superpower we would have 
trouble killing a fly 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams defended the 
negotiations in a telephone interview saying people critical of 
the negotiations criticized us when we were not negotiating thats 
called politics abrams argued that the negotiations revealed 
americas good faith and noriegas lack of it 
james hackett an associate at the heritage foundation said 
that the administrations first mistake was in bringing drug 
smuggling indictments last february against noriega 
you dont go around indicting foreign presidents or rulers 
said hackett a former foreign service officer who once served in 
panama 
it was a very unfortunate thing to try to do he said the 
whole thing was handled poorly 
douglas bandow of the cato institute agreed that its a little 
crazy to blame other countries for a us drug problem 
several of the experts were unable to recall any instance in 
which federal indictments were handed down against a foreign 
leader the closest recent parallel to the noriega case was the 
1985 indictment and subsequent conviction of norman sanders a 
former chief minister of the turks and caicos islands a british 
dependency in the caribbean 
abrams in the interview on friday discounted criticism of the 
indictments the indictments drove noriega crazy and gave us a 
terrific bargaining tool abrams said for negotiating 
purposes they turned out to be useful he added suggesting that 
administration envoys would not have come as close to an agreement 
as they did without them 
ms loser of the center for strategic and international studies 
said that what started out as an internal panamanian problem 
snowballed into a bilateral problem 
ms loser who recently returned from a visit to panama said 
that the united states mistakenly treated him noriega like 
twobit tin horn dictator thats not how you treat someone of that 
caliber 
ms loser said that the united states should maintain and 
tighten existing economic sanctions against panama she said 
noriega is being aided economically by the money being poured into 
the panamanian economy by the 50000 americans living there and she 
recommended a way be found to limit the amount of money spent by 
americans from circulating in panama 
ambler moss a former ambassador to panama agreed with ms 
loser that the united states should have joined with other latin 
american countries in the attempt to negotiate a settlement 
i think we missed a good bet all along by going it alone and 
becoming the principal actor unilaterally in somebody elses 
internal political crisis he said 
moss also said secretary of state george p shultz may have been 
wrong in saying last wednesday that the talks with noriega had 
ended when the panamanian leader backed out of a deal that his 
subordinates had negotiated 
moss said that it was possible that the deal was vetoed by 
noriegas subordinates who were worried that the deal did not 
protect their interests 
after all noriega isnt the only bad apple in the barrel 
moss said a number of them apparently according to the 
indictments have been engaged in the drug business they may 
wonder where all this leaves them at the end of the day and when 
there is a cleanup theyre going to be the ones that get cleaned 
up 
but abrams disagreed with that theory he said the most likely 
explanation was that noriega after overseeing a prolonged 
negotiating process could not bring himself to accept a deal that 
required him to say im through

the government on saturday announced 
massive price hikes and a 239 percent devaluation of the yugoslav 
currency as part of an austerity program aimed at reducing rampant 
inflation and a huge foreign debt 
gasoline prices saturday increased an average of 361 percent 
electricity 314 percent postal services 281 percent rail 
transport 385 percent and coal 303 percent a government 
announcement said 
the government also lifted price controls on about 60 percent of 
commodities at a time when yugoslavias inflation is hovering at 
about 170 percent europes highest 
thousands of workers have protested the measures since they were 
first unveiled in may staging a wave of strikes across the 
country more than 300 miners from tuzla in central yugoslavia 
traveled on foot and by bus to belgrade last week to join the 
protests 
how can i do heavy physical work if i am hungry one miner 
lamented 
the austerity package calls for a reduction in wages of up to 30 
percent at a time when 80 percent of manufacturers have announced 
higher prices for their products the prices have been frozen since 
november 
prices will go up and wages down how can we survive 
another protester asked yugoslav officials in the federal 
parliament 
the unpopular measures aimed at curbing the inflation rate and 
repaying the 20 billion foreign debt are expected to worsen 
yugoslavias living standards which have already declined by 
onethird since 1980 
the government has prepared an emergency social welfare program 
to assist those with the lowest incomes according to the staterun 
tanjug news service the prices of such staples as cooking oil 
flour and milk remained frozen but producers will be compensated 
by the state the government said 
with those prices we can barely afford to purchase staples 
said dragan petrovic a belgrade civil engineer he was interviewed 
at a gas station where the price of regular gasoline is almost 2 
a gallon 
i will have to stop driving my car he said 
the gasoline price hike resulted from the devaluation of the 
yugoslav currency the dinar which has pushed up the price of 
foreign oil in local currency 
saturdays devaluation is intended to decrease the countrys 
foreign debt by making yugoslav goods cheaper abroad however the 
measure may at the same time make many imports too expensive for 
yugoslavs to buy 
the dinar was last devalued in november 1987 but it has 
continued to lose ground against foreign currencies in relation to 
the american dollar the value of the dinar has dropped more than 
250 percent in just a year 
the new economic package was originally scheduled to start may 
15 but was put off because of the lack of new loans from western 
creditors 
introduction of the measures adopted in conjuction with the 
international monetary fund appeared to indicate that yugoslavia 
had obtained about 400 million in new western credits which 
government said were necessary to back up the austerity program 
the country will need an additional 600 million loan before the 
end of 1988 to sustain the new measures tanjug said saturday 
but it also said there were realistic possibilities in the 
current negotiations with foreign creditors for a longterm 
rescheduling of 105 billion of yugoslavias debt

the soviet union indicated saturday it might slow 
the withdrawal of troops from afghanistan if pakistan keeps aiding 
the afghan guerrillas and it accused washington of fueling the war 
with lavish supplies to the rebels 
the foreign ministry statement came one day before president 
reagans arrival in moscow for his fourth summit with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev the soviet threat appeared likely to push the 
afghan war toward the top of the agenda during meetings between the 
two leaders 
the soviets said if pakistan did not halt interference in the 
internal affairs of afghanistan they would draw pertinent 
conclusions with respect to the timetable of the troop withdrawal 
and take concrete steps 
the bellicose mood of the pakistani leadership is backed up by 
the lavish supplies of us arms to pakistan intended specifically 
for the antigovernment afghan forces which does not serve the 
goal of ending the fratricidal war between the afghans said the 
statement which was carried by the tass news agency and the 
evening news show vremya 
in washington state department spokeswoman anita stockman said 
she saw nothing new in the situation and cited statements of 
secretary of state george shultz at last months signing of the 
troop withdrawal agreement 
shultz told soviet officials then that the united states had the 
right to provide military aid to the afghan resistance was ready to 
exercise that right but was also prepared to meet restraint with 
restraint 
there is no change in our position said ms stockman 
the united states has been supplying afghan rebels with an 
estimated 500 million annually in arms and other military supplies 
channeled through pakistan it has pledged to continue to do so as 
long as the soviet union keeps up its military support of the 
afghan government 
the soviet union began on may 15 withdrawing its more than 
100000 troops from afghanistan under the accord signed in geneva 
the troops intervened in 1979 to back the afghan government in its 
war with moslem guerrillas 
the foreign ministry statement said that since may 15 10000 
troops had been withdrawn from afghanistan during the same period 
the statement said over 100 vehicles carrying weapons were 
dispatched from islamabad to guerrilla bases along the 
afghanpakistani border 
if the pakistani side does not adopt appropriate measures to 
end interference in the internal affairs of afghanistan from its 
territory the soviet union reserves the right to react to this in 
a manner as warranted by the situation the foreign ministry 
statement said 
it was only within the context of the agreement on 
noninterference in geneva that it became possible to agree on 
the question of the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan 
the statement said 
in the last two weeks soviet officials and media have 
repeatedly complained that pakistan has failed to keep its part of 
the noninterference pact and continued to aid the rebels 
a gorbachev aide also complained on friday that the united 
states had violated the geneva accords by continuing to ship 
weapons to the guerrillas yevgeny primakov said the united states 
was jeopardizing the accords 
for their part the rebels have pledged to use force to dislodge 
the sovietbacked government and put a moslem government in its 
place

it took six planes and 22 parachute 
packers but dale nelson has set what he thinks is a record 301 
dives in less than 24 hours about 4 minutes per jump 
he said he completed the feat friday which raised thousands of 
dollars for four charities with no fear and no stress 
witnesses said nelson completed 301 consecutive skydives between 
5 pm thursday and about 330 pm friday surpassing the mark of 
250 listed by the guinness book of world records 
im not that tired it was an adrenaline rush all 24 hours 
nelson 38 and a father of two teenagers said in a telephone 
interview shortly after completing jump no 301 
over and over again nelson would ride an airplane to 2000 
feet jump out and parachute to a landing take off the used 
chute strap on a freshly packed one and climb on another waiting 
airplane 
with a crew of pilots and 22 parachute packers nelson a 
291jump veteran before the record attempt said he never feared 
for his safety 
it was 100 percent trust zero stress he said 
david huber of issaquah wash set the 250jump mark over the 
fourth of july weekend in 1985 nelsons jumps wont be noted as a 
record until the guinness editors verify the feat through 
interviews with witnesses according to david boehm american 
editor for guinness 
nelson of bryn mawr received 26000 in cash and pledges 
before he started jumping and has gathered more money through 
donations parking fees and sales of 10 tshirts to the roughly 
1000 people who dropped by the new hanover airport to watch said 
nelsons sister judy nelson 
ms nelson said she and her brother had budgeted about 16000 
of the money for expenses but many pilots and parachute packers 
donated their time 
id guess it will be about half that well have to pay for 
gasoline and some plane expense she said 
nelson reserved six airplanes with only two in use at any one

the folks in lake wobegon must be 
wondering what in the world has gotten into that boy garrison 
keillor has taken to the city 
a prairie home companion the most popular show on public 
radio is coming back temporarily but the endless cornfields are 
shadowed by skyscrapers and all those norwegian bachelor farmers 
are rubbing elbows with the homeless 
one year after it ended its 13year run keillors uniquely 
personal show will be broadcast next saturday from new yorks radio 
city music hall miles and worlds apart from its former home in

to a prairie home companion his eclectic mix of music and wit 
that had been broadcast live from st paul minn 
it simply is time to go he had said detailing his plans to 
move to his wifes native country denmark and return to writing 
keillors move to denmark though lasted only a few months he 
found it difficult to live in a land so foreign with a language 
with those strange words that sound like singing birds 
keillor simply became homesick he told his middlebury audience 
friday that he would see those sweet sweet pictures of the usa 
and i would miss my hometown its become a paradise ever since 
ive moved away 
but keillor opted against moving back to minnesota instead he 
headed to the big apple 
and while his new show is still peppered with commercials from 
those familiar faces and familiar places like lake wobegons 
chatterbox cafe where the coffeepot is always on which is why 
it tastes that way it is clear this chronicler of rural life is 
smitten with city ways 
new york is the strangest city ive ever seen he told his 
middlebury audience conceding though i like new york a lot 
his fascination with the city shows up in the adventures of 
buster the show dog a regular fixture on the old program the 
latest installment finds buster lost in manhattan as his owners 
fight through grime and step over the homeless to find their pet 
asking new yorkers how come you have to be so rude all the 
time 
although keillor himself said friday he was rustier than he 
thought after a year away it was clear his wit remains sharp 
some keillorisms 
squinting at the audience after the opening of the show he 
said people had told me youd put on weight i dont think you 
have 
he described the month of march as the month god designed to 
show people who dont drink what a hangover is like 
</TEXT>

bestselling lake wobegon days suggested creation of a federal 
prose stabilization program to pay us writers not to write 
during that year 
he said the motto of the new york times is the world is not 
chaotic it is run by reasonable people and we know them 
asked whether new york now felt like home he said after 
fridays performance yes it does i didnt realize that until i 
flew out to minnesota recently

shows every june he does not plan to do any of those at his old 
home of the world theater though

michael dukakis traded jokes with comedians robin 
williams and billy crystal on saturday but when the humor started 
to turn offcolor the democratic presidential frontrunner 
jokingly told williams to tone it down 
the two comedians were presenting a 217000 check for homeless 
assistance to a boston health care group 
handing the check to boston mayor raymond l flynn crystal 
said youll need two forms of id if you have them but hold it 
till thursday 
the exchange took place at a statehouse ceremony in which the 
boston health care for the homeless project received the check from 
comic relief a organizations formed by 80 comedians in 1986 which 
has raised 47 million for the homeless in 23 cities nationwide 
speaking of comic relief we had some yesterday dukakis 
said 
the vice president said his cholesterol level was going up he 
was angry and his cholesterol level was going up i wonder what he 
meant by that 
dukakis got a laugh but crystal got a bigger one 
too much fat in the budget he said 
you can use that i think itll work crystal added turning 
to dukakis but youve got to give it some punch 
we are delighted to be here to celebrate the cholesterol level 
of mr bush and the rising formaldehyde level of president 
reagan crystal said we met at this hour because mercury and 
jupiter were in perfect alignment 
williams said he had yet to perfect an impersonation of dukakis 
but he did step forward and with an upbeat voice and choppy 
delivery characteristic of the governor 
im working on it right now because im feeling really good 
about it i havent got it yet but i hope too soon 
if he gets into the white house his ass will be on the 
line williams said 
when williams made one offcolor remark that was a play on 
astrological and anatomical terms dukakis told him to stop it 
this is not hbo home box office the massachusetts 
governor said this is the governors press conference 
dukakis took the opportunity to charge the reagan administration 
with failing to build adequate housing for the nations homeless 
and pledged to reverse the trend if elected 
he said state funding for the homeless had increased to 166 
million from 118 million in the last five years and the 
legislature has authorized more than 1 billion for construction of 
affordable housing for working and lowincome families 
theres only one reason today we have homeless people in 
america dukakis said its because we arent building 
affordable housing for people of low and moderate income its as 
simple as that 
if all goes well this fall were going to start building 
affordable housing for families and businesses of low and moderate 
income

after student protesters overturned ballot 
boxes upended polling booths and exchanged blows with workers 
during a student election ucla officials said a rescheduled vote 
will be heavily guarded 
winston doby vice chancellor of student affairs at the 
university of california los angeles said friday the school was 
investigating thursdays melee and was exploring the possibility of 
disciplinary action 
a group of about 200 mostly minority students marched on polling 
places after a heated rally protesting the disqualification of a 
hispanic candidate lloyd monserratt for student body president 
ive never seen in my history at ucla students disrupt a 
free and open election doby said whenever you have a 
challenge to the free and open electoral process you have to view 
that as a very critical and serious problem because that principle 
underlies a free democracy 
no arrests or serious injuries were reported 
some monserratt supporters contended his disqualification after 
he won the campus primary three weeks ago was racially motivated 
monserratt was removed from the ballot by the schools student 
governing body the undergraduate student association council 
because of a subpar grade point average and a lack of college 
credits doby said 
he blamed the disqualification for the election fracas and 
admitted racial tensions exist on the campus 
i think theres no question that in our student politics 
there is racial tension doby said 
the student council nullified last thursdays voting because 
some ballots were stolen by protesters 
the new vote will take place next thursday under heavy guard by 
campus police doby said 
nearly 44 percent of the schools 23000 undergraduates are 
black hispanic or asian the highest level of minority enrollment 
in campus history doby said 
one might argue that our increased tension is an indication of 
our success at bringing minorities into the student population

recordbreaking crowds to the southcentral pennsylvania 
battlefield now a national park where union troops forced the 
confederate army to retreat from northern soil after three days of 
bitter bloody fighting july 13 1863 
many historians view the battle as the decisive event in the 
war in all nearly 50000 union and confederate troops were killed 
or wounded after gen robert e lee invaded the north 
after clashing with yankees at harrisburg and chambersburg 
lees troops met union forces under gen george g meade west of 
gettysburg on july 1 the climax of the battle came july 3 when lee

this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to 
the proposition tha all men are created equal lincoln said

for which the soldiers gave their lives the last full measure 
of devotion so that government of the people by the people 
for the people shall not perish from the earth 
in an average year 14 million visitors tour the battlefield 
this year officials say 2 million or more could come to town 
its going to be a little problem but weve handled this 
before said mayor frank linn 
during the reenactment thousands of civil war buffs will 
participate in a scaleddown version of the fighting at a farm 
outside of town park service rules prohibit a reenactment on the 
actual battlefield

federal officials to convert the flame to an electric light money 
from private donors was raised to pay for the fuel and to repair 
the gas lines 
astronomer carl sagan is scheduled to speak at the relighting 
ceremony president reagan has also been invited but has not yet

aquatic shows in the 250acre 140 million park whose main 
attraction is shamu the threeton killer whale 
the park took three years to plan and build and has been open 
since midapril to allow employees and animal trainers time to 
acquaint themselves with their jobs

strutted as hundreds of colored balloons and a thousand doves were 
released into the sky while four f16 fighter jets flew overhead 
sea world of texas is ready park chairman george becker

we dedicate it to the children and families of this great 
state our hope is that it will bring joy and education to millions 
over the years

more than 10 million visitors who pump more than 1 billion into 
the local economy 
sea world officials expect the park to attract another 3 million 
visitors to san antonio and texas which continues to struggle from 
a skid in oil prices 
texas officials are putting more money into tourist marketing 
trying to attract vacationers to offset the loss in petroleum 
dollars

attract the park to the city in 1985 said it will be a drawing 
card for tourists 
parking lots were full throughout the day but there were

vice president george bush spent saturday planning how to depart 
from some reagan administration policies while preparing to attack 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis for his performance as 
governor of massachusetts 
the vice president is a man firmly committed to setting his 
own agenda i dont think there was any doubt about that at all 
illinois gov james thompson said after two days of strategy 
meetings at bushs oceanside vacation retreat at kennebunkport 
maine 
new hampshire gov john sununu who also met with bush said 
that the domestic side is going to be one of the strong points of 
the bush campaign and the bush presidency in contrast to what he 
said were management failures of the dukakis administration as 
governor of massachusetts 
in response to sununus comments dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
cited the economic health of massachusetts and added a jab of his 
own if there werent jobs in massachusetts for the people who 
lived in new hampshire the new hampshire unemployment rate would 
practically triple 
on the vice presidents agenda during private meetings at 
kennebunkport were the legal troubles of attorney general edwin 
meese iii and the failed negotiations to force panamanian ruler and 
alleged drug trafficker manuel antonio noriega from power 
meanwhile democrat jesse jackson campaigning in a housing 
project in atlantic city nj commissioned himself a general in 
the war on drugs while bestowing lesser ranks on dukakis and bush 
although bush opposed the administrations efforts to negotiate 
a deal with noriega the issue remains campaign fodder for the 
democrats 
silence for sanctuary is sleaze jackson said of the noriega 
deal 
bush is fighting the war on drugs after seven years he just 
joined it jackson said im the general in this war on drugs 
ive led this fight 
jackson told a crowd of about 200 people at a housing project 
plagued by drug problems and gang violence that dukakis is a 
captain in the war and bush a lieutenant 
jackson is concentrating his memorial day weekend campaigning on 
new jersey one of four states holding primaries on june 7 at 
stake in california new jersey new mexico and montana are 466 
delegates 
dukakis holds a commanding lead over jackson in the latest 
associated press tally with 1711 delegates to jacksons 984 to 
nominate 2081 are needed 
thompson and sununu were among the gop officials urging bush to 
stake out his own territory on a number of issues apart from reagan 
but gop advisers said there are limits to how far bush can go in 
distancing himself from reagan since it was his close 
identification with the popular president that helped him clinch 
the republican nomination bush locked up the 1139 delegates 
needed to nominate on april 26 with a win in the pennsylvania 
primary 
reagan in a taped interview with soviet journalists said he 
expects bush if elected to continue the type of dialogue he has 
established with the kremlin leadership 
if the next president is the president i would like to see 
there the present vice president i know he would continue on this 
track reagan said and but i think that our people want 
this 
the interview conducted in washington last week was broadcast 
in the soviet union on saturday 
in boston dukakis traded jokes with comedians robin williams 
and billy crystal as the two presented a 217000 check for 
homeless assistance to a boston health care group 
handing the check to boston mayor raymond l flynn crystal 
said youll need two forms of id if you have them but hold it 
till thursday 
the exchange took place at a statehouse ceremony in which the 
boston health care for the homeless project received the check from 
comic relief a organizations formed by 80 comedians in 1986 which 
has raised 47 million for the homeless in 23 cities nationwide 
speaking of comic relief we had some yesterday dukakis

the vice president said his cholesterol level was going up he 
was angry and his cholesterol level was going up i wonder what he 
meant by that 
dukakis got a laugh but crystal got a bigger one 
too much fat in the budget he said 
dukakis had no comment on a 10page letter circulated by a 
senate gop leadership aide and a conservative political group that 
said the massachusetts governor is a pagan who uses his 
membership in the greek orthodox church as just a convenient 
prop for political purposes 
james jatras an aide to sen william l armstrong rcolo 
said saturday that he sent out the letter because dukakis is 
campaigning around the country presenting himself as an orthodox 
christian in good standing 
hes simply not that i want to make them aware of the facts 
hes misrepresenting his religion to people jatras said in a 
telephone interview 
the letter also circulated in greek communities by the ad hoc 
committee in defense of life a new yorkbased antiabortion group 
cites dukakis prochoice stand on abortion and his marriage to a 
nonchristian his wife kitty dukakis is jewish 
jatras who is greek orthodox said he conferred with a number 
of greek orthodox bishops and priests who share his view and have 
written him in support 
he is falsely presenting a religion not only to orthodox 
faithful but to the american public jatras said im am asking 
him to desist from this masquerade 
there is no reason he has to adopt this phony identity for 
political purposes he said

into that of south africa

more than 200 pregnant women may have unknowingly 
taken a drug as part of a study conducted by two cook county 
hospital physicians the hospitals director says 
the study was to determine if dilantin a common drug used to 
treat epilepsy and stroke patients could reduce fetal stress in 
cases of caesarean section births said terrence hansen the 
hospitals director 
about 245 pregnant women were given the drug by two 
anesthesiologists between late september 1987 and jan 16 but an 
initial review showed that just five of the women signed consent 
forms to be part of the study hansen said late friday 
it is against hospital policies not to obtain the patients 
signed consent hansen said in a telephone interview in this 
case they did not 
hansen said he knew of no injuries caused by the administration 
of the dilantin which he characterized as a common drug 
the dosages were small he said its very very unlikely 
that there were side effects or detrimental effects 
hansen declined to identify the two doctors but said the 
recommended punishment was probation a warning that could lead to 
disciplinary measures by the hospital if the doctors commit further 
policy violations 
he said two babies born to the 245 mothers died but he said 
both deaths resulted from complications because of significant 
prematurity he said autopsies performed ruled out a link to the 
dilantin 
the hospital is run by the county and is on the citys 
economically depressed west side 
the study was approved by a hospital physicians committee in 
september but after a routine review of the research the issue of 
the consent forms was raised according to hansen 
the hospitals executive medical staff a group of about 35 
doctors last week recommended one year of probation for the two 
doctors involved hansen said 
the final word on what punishment if any will be applied is up 
to the cook county board which acts as the hospitals board of 
trustees hansen said the board next meets june 6 he said 
the drug most likely would have been administered intravenously 
he said 
hansen could not say if all of the women who were given the drug 
were candidates for caesarean section births he said hospital 
officials were conducting their own review of patient records in 
the case 
hansen also said he did not know the status of the research

george bush will part company with 
president reagan on a variety of domestic issues in a campaign that 
will also portray democrat michael dukakis management record as a 
failed one two republican governors said saturday 
govs john sununu of new hampshire and james thompson of 
illinois told reporters that bush was working to develop a package 
of new proposals on child care the homeless housing education 
and drug education 
the vice president is a man firmly committed to setting his 
own agenda i dont think there was any doubt about that at all 
thompson said after two days of strategy meetings at bushs 
oceanside vacation retreat 
bush is meeting with republican leaders and advisers during his 
weeklong stay 
sununu said that the domestic side is going to be one of the 
strong points of the bush campaign and the bush presidency in 
contrast to what he said were management failures of the dukakis 
administration as governor of massachusetts 
responding to sununus comments dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
said if there werent jobs in massachusetts for the people who 
lived in new hampshire the new hampshire unemployment rate would 
practically triple 
dach said the dukakis campaign would be happy to debate the 
governors economic record because when we do it reminds voters 
that mike dukakis has a record of innovative accomplishments for 
people and george bush has seven years of silence on critical 
domestic issues 
sununus comments signaled an apparent decision by bush campaign 
strategists to take on dukakis directly on domestic policy issues 
usually considered his strong suit 
sununu cited an inability to handle the budget and alleged 
failure of dukakis to modernize the states prison facilities or do 
a better job in processing welfare payments for families with 
dependent children 
he also claimed the dukakis administration had failed to project 
future state spending levels carefully raising prospects of 
hundreds of millions of dollar deficits if there is an economic 
downturn 
sununu a longtime bush supporter said that the vice 
presidents campaign would seek in the months ahead to show voters 
the difference of the reality of what dukakis has done versus 
the perception 
thompson said that during the strategy session bush was given 
guidence on what works and what doesnt work in the real world 
the bottom line is that george bush wants to make the nation 
work thompson said 
republican leaders have been urging bush to put distance between 
himself and reagan and bush has been striking out in recent days 
in an effort to do just that 
thompson and other participants at the weekend strategy and 
issues sessions had few details of what the new bush domestic 
programs would contain thompson said they would be unveiled at the 
appropriate time 
during the meetings bush and his campaign aides also discussed 
the problems of embattled attorney general edwin meese iii and the 
fallout over failed negotiations with panamanian leader manuel 
antonio noriega 
the troubles still hound bush as recent polls indicated that 
likely democratic nominee michael dukakis held a doubledigit lead 
over the vice president bush shrugs off the polling data claiming 
he likes being able to fight back as an underdog but the results 
have top campaign strategists worried 
ive never been in a campaign when i wouldnt rather be ahead 
than behind says bush pollster robert teeter 
meanwhile an aide to bush declined to comment on a report in 
saturdays editions of the washington post that bush met privately 
with meese earlier this month to discuss political ramifications of 
the attorney generals ongoing legal problems 
citing unidentified sources the newspaper said it could not be 
learned what bush told meese 
rep lynn martin rill one of those invited to meet with bush 
in maine said a healthy economy and a diminished soviet threat 
have given social issues more importance in this years 
presidential campaign posing a problem not only to bush but for 
all republicans 
democrats are generally identified with being more concerned 
than republicans on social issues she said 
the fact is were moving into the 1990s issues like day 
care which were not issues in 1980 are issues today when we see 
50 percent of the women with children under three working so you 
dont have to move away from ronald reagan youre just moving into 
a new era ms martin said 
it wasnt all work for the vice president he has been taking 
guests out for short rides in the atlantic ocean on his power boat 
fidelity and on monday he planned to march in the annual 
kennebunkport memorial day parade

the ousted president eric arturo 
delvalle waits in hiding to resume his job with washingtons 
blessing but the general who had him dismissed has stared down the 
colossus of the north and wont let go 
the united states still recognizes delvalle but apparently did 
not push for his restoration to power in talks with gen manuel 
antonio noriega head of the military and de facto leader of 
panama those discussions on an arrangement for noriega to step 
down collapsed last week 
opposition groups have conducted lowkey demonstrations 
demanding that noriega go but little public sentiment has been 
expressed about delvalle 
delvalle himself in a rare meeting with foreign journalists 
last week said there is no reason for him to surrender his claim 
to the presidency 
why should i he replied when asked if there were 
circumstances under which he might abandon it 
this is one of the basic factors respect for the constitution 
by the military he said all over latin america there has been 
a clear loud message that the military are below civilian 
government 
under no circumstances should it be considered that i resign 
as president of the republic to satisfy the pride of gen 
noriega he added 
delvalle tried to dismiss noriega on feb 25 as commander of 
panamas army and police the next day noriega supporters in the 
national assembly voted to dismiss delvalle 
us federal courts indicted noriega on drug trafficking charges 
in july and washington has imposed economic sanctions on panama in 
an attempt to oust him 
more negotiations discussions as the general calls them are 
likely this time with latin american democracies taking part and 
other opposition leaders question whether they can or should go to 
the mat for delvalle 
i believe all panamanians who want a democracy must be willing 
to contribute to the fight and to sacrifice positions when the 
moment arrives said ricardo arias calderon head of panamas 
christian democrat party this applies to all 
he and other opposition figures advocate a government of 
national conciliation that would bring various sectors together 
guillermo endara of the largest opposition party the authentic 
panamenists said delvalle is probably not the person to solve 
the panamanian crisis at this time 
he said delvalle who comes from the small businessoriented 
republican party does not have a broad base 
panamanian authorities issued an arrest warrant for delvalle two 
months ago but has made no evident effort to find him 
delvalle told journalists he has not left panama since he went 
into hiding shortly after he his dismissal and denied living in 
any embassy or on a military base the united states maintains 
military installations along the panama canal 
some members of his family stay at the residence of us 
ambassador arthur davis but embassy officials say delvalle is not 
the military seems adamant that manuel solis palma who replaced 
delvalle remain as president a tentative deal between the united 
states and noriegas negotiators was turned down because it did not 
guarantee that he would remain in office

gunmen believed to be sinhalese 
nationalists burst into the home of an opposition party candidate 
saturday and fatally shot the candidate and two supporters police 
said 
indian troops meanwhile conducted sweeps of jungle areas in 
northeastern sri lanka on saturday the sixth day of an offensive 
aimed at wiping out tamil rebel bases in the area 
an indian official who spoke on condition of anonymity said at 
least 36 tamil rebels were killed and 45 injured since the 
offensive began near the port of mullaitivu on monday three rebel 
bases have been overrun by the 6000 indian troops involved in the 
operation the official said 
police said sb yalagama 58 a member of the opposition united 
socialist alliance and two campaign workers were meeting at the 
politicians residence when three men broke in and opened fire 
yalagama a candidate in the provincial elections scheduled for 
june 9 lived in the town of natala 65 miles northeast of colombo 
a police officer speaking on condition of anonymity blamed the 
killing on the peoples liberation front an extremist group of 
sinhalese nationalists the group has vowed to block the voting 
the elections are the second to be held under the 
indiansponsored peace accord signed july 29 to try to end the 
tamil rebel insurgency in northern and eastern sri lanka 
the extremists who have been blamed for the deaths of 290 
people since then have vowed to kill anyone supporting the pact 
claiming that it makes too many concessions to the minority tamils 
indias military drive against the tamils is the strongest since 
october when indian troops launched a 10day offensive to drive 
the rebels out of the jaffna peninsula in the north 
the indian high commission or embassy said 10 indian soldiers 
were killed and 21 injured since monday but the rebels have said 
they killed 25 indian soldiers and lost one of their men 
the conflicting claims could not be independently verified 
because communications have been cut off with mullativu 175 miles 
northeast of colombo 
india has sent more than 50000 troops to the island to enforce 
the accord which called on tamil rebels to lay down their arms in 
exchange for the creation of district councils to give people more 
say in local government affairs 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest of the rebel 
groups rejected the pact and has continued its rebellion 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people they claim they are discriminated against by the 
sinhalese buddhists who make up about 75 percent of the population

girls have moved from the sidelines to the front 
lines of the citys gangs adding a twist to the warfare that used 
to be a male domain an official said saturday 
traditionally young women stayed on the fringes of male gangs 
concealing weapons and narcotics for their gangmember boyfriends 
said robert martin executive director of chicago intervention 
network a city agency charged with reducing gang violence 
but now there are seven to nine independent female gangs in the 
city most of which have cropped up in the last six months martin 
said in a telephone interview 
they have names identity membership and codes all that is 
used to keep the group together and promote a certain direction 
he said in a telephone interview 
theres a trend for the girls to carry something called a 
carpet knife a razor used to cut carpet professionally and they 
carry it around as their weapon of choice he said 
like their male counterparts the young women may have joined 
the groups for a feeling of belonging martin said but the gangs 
have evolved into hubs for stealing purse snatching and violence 
most violent acts are in retaliation for harm done to a gang 
member he added 
there are no figures yet on how many young women are involved in 
these new gangs martin said the city estimates there are about 
15000 male gang members 
the female gangs tend to be less organized than their male 
counterparts and so far most of them have not come to the 
sophistication of selling drugs martin said 
but its girl gang activity escalating because you have 
older people orchestrating it and showing them they can make more 
money as a gang than individually he said 
martin said the girl gangs have sprung up because of a decline 
in social services a liberation of the role of women an increase 
in drug use by women and the deterioration of the family structure 
females now feel free to go after the same kinds of things 
that males go after money recognition status even the mate 
they want he said 
a greater number of girls are out on the street unsupervised 
looking for something and the gang gives it to them martin said 
the chicago police department has no statistics on the 
membership of girl gangs but females under 20 are responsible for 
an increasing number of serious crimes the chicago suntimes 
reported in early editions of sundays newspaper 
they accounted for 14 murders in 1987 up from 12 the year 
before females under 20 also were responsible for 2229 assaults 
up from 1789 the year before the sun times reported 
we have a number of females unsupervised on the streets and if 
we sleep on that well see the women gangs become more organized 
and developed as the male gangs martin said 
martin said the government no longer provides adequate funding 
for programs for youth so the gang structure has stepped in to 
provide some of those services martin said 
i believe its a culmination of things females are seeing 
males their own age with money being part of a group seemingly 
being confident and having fun and theyre going after it too 
he said but once youre in a gang the nightmare begins 
the chicago intervention network is sponsoring a firstever 
conference for young women friday modeled after an allday seminar 
in december for some 500 boys belonging to an estimated 18 rival 
gang factions in chicago 
about 300 teenage girls are expected to attend workshops on the 
risks of joining gangs and alternative social activities pregnancy 
prevention and careers

the senates work on the mediumrange missile 
treaty shows that lawmakers will carefully scrutinize any arms pact 
and not be just a rubber stamp for the president say the chambers 
leaders 
that theme was heard often during the two weeks of floor debate 
on the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty ratified 
friday by a 935 vote and is likely to continue for any future 
arms agreements 
the senate has clearly made visible that it is an equal 
partner with any president in the making of treaties said senate 
majority leader robert byrd dwva and i hope that will be a 
sobering impact on this president and mr gorbachev when they sit 
down and discuss another agreement 
white house chief of staff howard h baker jr who left with 
the treaty saturday to join president reagan in helsinki said the 
ratified pact indicated a new spirit of bipartisan cooperation 
between the president and congress 
the president i believe has shown his dedication to peace 
his dedication to strength his dedication to see he leaves a 
legacy of a better world and a safer world at the end of his eight 
years as president baker told reporters at andrews air force 
base 
there will be a ceremonial exchange of the treaty documents in 
moscow on wednesday and baker said the exchange signaled a 
historic improvement of the relationship of the two superpowers of 
the world 
the inf pact in a lot of ways was a stalking horse for 
start said sen william cohen rmaine referring to the 
proposed strategic arms reduction treaty 
both cohen and byrd noted that the inf was closely scrutinized 
by three different committees if the senate learned anything from 
its work on the treaty byrd said it is that we have to ask a 
lot of questions that we have to look very closely 
we were very deliberative we were very thorough and i believe 
that we have improved this treaty said byrd i think weve 
closed all the loopholes we know about in this treaty and its a 
much better treaty than when it was sent to capitol hill 
byrd had pulled the inf treaty off the senates calendar due to 
questions that were raised about whether the soviet union intended 
to comply with all verification provisions 
i resisted the pressure to bring up this treaty until the 
faults could be corrected said byrd the administrations 
negotiators went back to geneva and corrected those faults it is 
now a better treaty than it ever was before 
cohen agreed noting i think that in some ways we improved 
the treaty we tied down some loose ends that perhaps could have 
caused trouble if we hadnt cleared them up 
but cohen asked if we had this much debate and trouble on a 
treaty like inf just imagine what would happen if we get a start 
treaty 
he noted that the inf pact was relatively straightforward and 
involved only a small percentage of each superpowers atomic 
arsenal by contrast a start agreement would reduce arsenals by 50 
percent and would require far more extensive verification 
provisions it would thus permit far more opportunities to cheat 
the biggest fight over the inf pact stemmed from a fight between 
president reagan and the democraticcontrolled congress over the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
reagan asserts that his administration has the legal authority 
to change the us interpretation of the 1972 pact a move that 
would permit expanded tests of reagans star wars antimissile 
system congressional democrats dispute that claim 
the senate approved an amendment to the inf ratification 
resolution banning any future president from reintepreting the 
pact unless congress first approves 
what we learned from that is that you have to be very careful 
you have to be very sure when you ratify a treaty said sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee and a chief 
critic of the proposed change in the abm pact 
byrd said the antiinterpretation amendment is a clear signal 
to the administration future administrations and the soviets 
that this senate will not roll over and play dead and is not a 
rubber stamp to any president 
but the suggestion that the senate was an equal partner with the 
president in the making of treaties brought a different response 
from sen arlen specter rpa 
this is one of the most serious constitutional issues to come 
before this body in a long time we are trampling on the 
constitution he said 
reagan submitted the inf pact to the senate on jan 25 
beginning an exhaustive review of the treaty by the foreign 
relations armed services and intelligence committee 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan said the scrutiny 
provided a model of how we should perform our role to advise and 
consent to treaties i think this the most closely examined arms 
control treaty in history 
but sen jesse helms rnc a critic of the inf pact 
continually decried what he termed this rush to judgment 
the inf pact was on the senate floor for nine days a far 
shorter time than previous treaties helms noted 
i think that any future treaty should be examined much more 
closely in much greater detail than we have done with this 
treaty our work here may well come back to haunt us he said

thousands of armenians rallied in their southern 
capital saturday demanding freedom for a jailed nationalist leader 
and calling for a holiday marking formation of their republic a 
soviet dissident said 
alexander ogorodnikov a russian orthodox activist in moscow 
said the crowd in yerevan near the turkish border sang patriotic 
songs and held up portraits of armenian national heroes and 
armenias national flag they also held pictures of paruyr 
ayrikyan a nationalist arrested in march and still under 
confinement 
police did not interfere in the twohour demonstration though 
the crowd prevented government officials from speaking to the rally 
through megaphones the activist said without elaborating 
ayrikyan emerged as a primary spokesman for activists shortly 
after armenians began demonstrating feb 13 for annexation of 
nagornokarabakh from neighboring azerbaijan a soviet republic on 
the caspian sea that borders with iran 
ogorodnikov said saturdays protest drew and estimated 50000 
people and occurred on the same square outside yerevans opera 
house where massive protests over the nagornokarabakh issue have 
been held 
portraits of ayrikyan and the armenian national flag were placed 
on the opera house said ogorodnikov who spent nearly nine years 
in jail for christian activism 
in addition to demanding the release of ayrikyan the 
demonstrators called on the government to celebrate the may 28 
1918 formation of the armenian republic with a holiday the 
armenian republic later was incorporated into the soviet union 
the protesters sent telegrams to the soviet parliaments known 
as supreme soviets in moscow and armenia outlining their demands 
ogorodnikov said 
ayrikyan 38 was leader of an underground armenian nationalist 
group called the national unification party and was jailed for 17 
years beginning in 1969 for his political activities before his 
late march arrest he said he was chairman of a group called the 
alliance for national selfdetermination 
ayrikyan is being held in armenia on a charge of defamation or 
spreading false information discrediting the soviet union 
nagornokarabakh has been part of the mainly moslem azerbaijan 
republic since 1923 although more than threequarters of the 
regions 160000 residents are armenians who are predominantly 
christian 
the annexation issue caused ethnic rioting for three days 
beginning feb 28 in sumgait in azerbaijan thirtytwo people were 
killed

hughes aircraft is under investigation 
because of allegations that it reaped millions of dollars in 
improper profits on a 1983 tow missile contract with the army a 
newspaper reported saturday 
a federal grand jury in birmingham ala has subpoenaed 13 
officials of the general motors subsidiary since february along 
with executive vice president d kenneth richardson who is to 
testify soon an unidentified company spokesman told the los 
angeles times 
at least seven federal employees have appeared before the jury 
and recently appointed hughes president malcolm r currie was 
interviewed by the us attorneys office in birmingham the 
newspaper reported 
currie was in charge of hughes missile systems group in los 
angeles in 1983 
the spokesman for the firm said the company denies any 
wrongdoing involving the 120 million contract which covered 
production in 1983 and 1984 
at issue is whether hughes negotiated the deal without telling 
the army it anticipated cutting costs by transferring production of 
missile wiring systems from a plant in tucson ariz to one in 
eufaula ala 
if hughes did anticipate the reduction and failed to tell the 
army there may be a violation of the federal truth in negotiation 
act the times said 
often defense contractors must surrender part of their profits 
if production costs are lower than those anticipated in their 
contracts 
hughes has built more than 400000 of the tow missiles they are 
tubelaunched optically tracked wireguided missiles which are 
designed to attack armored vehicles 
earlier this month it was disclosed that another federal grand 
jury is investigating whether hughes consultants in south america 
diverted some of their fees to a customer in connection with 
satellite sales

despite the objections of gov michael s dukakis 
13 massachusetts national guard public affairs specialists left 
early saturday for two weeks of training in panama and honduras 
dukakis the frontrunner for the democratic presidential 
nomination held a news conference at the statehouse after the 
groups departure but did not comment on it 
dukakis opposes the reagan administrations deployment of 
national guard troops in central america on constitutional grounds 
and has appealed a us district court ruling on may 6 that upheld 
the assignment 
the governor did not seek to block the departure pending a 
resolution of the appeal because he could not prove the detachment 
would suffer irreparable harm but his press aide said dukakis 
would continue to contest the issue 
we feel theres an important constitutional issue involved 
concerning the 200 years of responsibility which states and 
governors have had over the peacetime training of their militia 
forces james dorsey the press secretary said friday 
the detachment which consists of writers and photographers for 
the massachusetts guards quarterly newsletter will observe us 
forces in the field and prepare accounts of their actions 
its important training for the unit it will be germane to 
their overall mobilization training that they have this 
experience said lt col stuart taubert director of press 
relations for adjutant general wayne wagner of the massachusetts 
national guard 
major warren pierce 39 of duxbury commander of the 65th 
public affairs detachment said last week he had no reservations 
about the assignment 
were looking forward to it he said 
in january when the states request to be excused from the 
training mission was denied by the pentagon dukakis and state 
attorney general james shannon filed suit charging that the orders 
violated the constitutional provision that left the training of the 
militia in the hands of the states 
a similar suit filed by minnesota gov rudy perpich was rejected 
by another federal court and is also on appeal

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini told irans 
parliament saturday the war with iraq will be decided on the 
battlefield not the negotiating table 
another iranian official accused the soviet union of providing 
iraq with at least 800 longrange missiles irans official islamic 
republic news agency reported 
irna quoted the deputy foreign minister ali mohammad besharati 
as saying in tehran that baghdads recent victories were only 
possible with us and soviet collaboration 
besharati did not say when moscow iraqs main arms supplier 
provided the missiles according to the report monitored in 
nicosia but the iraqis fired nearly 200 longrange missiles 
believed to modified soviet scudb weapons at iranian cities 
between feb 29 and april 21 
khomeini irans 87yearold revolutionary patriarch made the 
declaration about battlefield victories despite irans admission 
that it suffered recent military defeats in the 7year war 
the combatants must continue their fight by depending on their 
faith in god and their weapons he said in a statement that his 
son ahmed read to the opening session of the majlis irans 
parliament the statement was broadcast by tehran radio also 
monitored in nicosia 
the fate of the war will be decided on the war fronts not 
through negotiations khomeini said victory will be ours 
tehran radio said president ali khamenei acknowledged during a 
tehran prayer session friday that the iraqis defeated irans army 
in recent weeks 
he gave no details but the unexpectedly blunt admission clearly 
referred to iraqs recapture of the faw peninsula in southern iraq 
on april 18 and an iranian bridgehead east of the port city of 
basra last week 
the iranians captured faw in february 1986 and had held about 76 
square miles of iraqi territory east of basra since early last year 
the iranians also lost a frigate and a missile craft in clashes 
with the us navy in the gulf april 18 military analysts said 
that was a serious blow to irans naval strength 
iran had seized the iraqi territory in two bloody offensives it 
represented the main gains it has made in the conflict 
western military analysts said the setbacks have jolted the 
tehran leadership at a time of mounting economic woes and a power 
struggle between radicals who want a staterun economy and 
conservatives who support a capitaliststyle system 
much of khomeinis statement was devoted to efforts to reform 
irans economy 
he urged the 270seat majlis to do more for irans poor and 
called for cooperation with the 13member council of guardians 
which approves laws passed by the parliament the council 
dominated by conservatives has blocked radicalinspired economic 
legislation in recent years 
radicals seeking economic reforms made major gains at the 
expense of the conservatives in the twostage elections in april 
and may 
radicals seek price controls a minimum wage land 
redistribution and other measures to help cope with runaway 
inflation and economic inequities 
conservative clerics charge the economic reforms violate islamic 
tenets that property is inviolable they are supported by the 
wealthy merchant class the new fouryear parliament is the third 
since khomeinis revolution toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 
1979

syrian troops on saturday ringed the area 
around the main barracks of the proiranian hezbollah where 
western hostages are believed held after deploying across south 
beirut to end three weeks of militia fighting 
a syrian command source said the soldiers would remain outside 
the hay madi district but the move into south beiruts slums 
appeared to increase pressure on the syrians to seek the release of 
nine americans and nine other foreign hostages held by proiranian 
groups believed linked to hezbollah 
in damascus syrias information minister said despite the troop 
movement there is no timetable for the release of the hostages 
we are still in the first step which is stopping the 
fighting mohammed salman told reporters we hope that through 
dialogue and political action and cooperation with friends we can 
obtain the release of the hostages 
a lebanese security source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the syrian deployment around hay madi was meant to tighten 
the grip on hezbollah because the kidnappers will not be able 
to move the hostages from one place to another 
the syrians who moved in friday under an agreement that halted 
the fighting between hezbollah and the syrianbacked amal militia 
were accompanied by 200 lebanese police the 1500 soldiers 
deployed saturday raised the total number in the 16squaremile 
maze of streets and alleys to 2600 
there were no reports of violence the fighting between the 
rival shiite militias broke out may 6 and left at least 300 people 
dead and 1000 wounded 
the syrian infantrymen armed with automatic weapons and 
rocketpropelled grenade launchers moved in after hezbollah and 
amal agreed to stop shooting hezbollah won control of 90 percent 
of the slums in the fighting 
salman said syrian troops were to withdraw within a few days 
and leave security in the hands of lebanese police 
but the information minister also said syrian troops will remain 
stationed at eight points on the perimeter of the area and be on 
constant alert to move in when security demands or when requested 
by the lebanese security forces 
the syrians made no attempt to deploy in the hay madi district 
a source at the syrian command speaking on condition of anonymity 
said hezbollahs barracks and its environs were not included in 
the deployment plan 
however they moved into surrounding districts and set up 
checkpoints into the area 
most of the foreign hostages in beirut are believed to be held 
in the hezbollah barracks the hostage held longest is terry 
anderson associated press chief middle east correspondent who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
the syrians have said they want to help gain the hostages 
release in bahrain vernon walters washingtons un ambassador 
said saturday during a middle east tour the syrians have assured 
me they will do everything they can to help and preserve the life 
and health of the hostages 
women waved white scarves and threw roses and rice at the syrian 
soldiers in a traditional welcome gesture as they marched into the 
embattled region

the most 
powerful us warship ever seen in the persian gulf passed through 
the strait of hormuz saturday on its first mission in the wartorn 
waterway 
the guided missile cruiser uss vincennes with 385 officers and 
crewmen aboard entered the gulf to begin the first deployment in 
the region by any of the navys 10 aegis cruisers 
the 9400ton warship commissioned in 1985 and equipped with 
sophisticated radar and weapons systems is the fourth us navy 
warship named for the indiana town where a decisive revolutionary 
war battle was fought 
the level of tension ran fairly high during the ships nighttime 
run up the narrow strait it passed about four miles from a 
panamanianflag tanker still on fire 20 hours after being attacked 
by iranian speedboats 
salvage tugboats were pouring water on the ship which was 
listing and appeared to have suffered severe fire damage to its 
superstructure 
the vincennes crew also saw flames leaping high in the sky from 
a burning structure on the iranian side of the strait it was not 
certain whether it may have been larak island an iranian offshore 
oil terminal devastated by iraqi warplanes in a raid two weeks ago 
the fastmoving warship was challenged by one of the omani navy 
boats that regularly patrol the straits to identify itself and the 
vincennes observing the standard gulf protocol said that it was 
an american warship hull number 49 
later as it passed the iranheld island of abu musa in the 
southern gulf the cruiser exchanged greetings with the missile 
frigate jack williams one of five us ships scheduled to depart 
the gulf in a few more days 
capt will c rogers iii skipper of the vincennes says the 
ship is preparing for its gulf duty with help from one of the 
strongest support networks for any ship in the us navy 
rogers said the indiana town keeps a close eye on its namesake 
it hosts a civic blowout every august a christmas project in which 
students at vincennes university send gifts to every man aboard and 
a twoyear vincennes university scholarship that goes annually to 
the cruisers sailor of the year 
ive been on a lot of ships and ive never seen anything like 
it rogers said 
rogers said the active vincennes support group began with three 
veterans of the world war iiera cruiser by that name it now has 
more than 650 members including rogers and about 70 others of the 
current ships crew 
the uss vincennes association has held annual reunions for the 
past 13 years with the indiana town hosting parades and a feast 
that last year featured 600 pounds of fresh catfish 
rogers who attended the 1987 festival said i dont think 
ive ever been made to feel so welcome or have been so royally 
treated as in those four days

the leftist government and rebel 
leaders suspended peace talks saturday but agreed to maintain a 
current truce at least until the two sides meet again in 10 days 
gen humberto ortega the head of the government delegation 
blamed enrique bermudez the rebel military commander for the 
failure to reach a definitive ceasefire agreement during the three 
days of talks 
a spokesman for the rebel delegation in managua said the 
compromise suspension came after the rebels rejected a 
government proposal for a 30day ceasefire extension a plan for 
delivering humanitarian aid to rebel units and a new round of 
talks starting on june 15 
the 60day ceasefire in the 6yearold war between the 
usbacked rebels known as contras and the sandinista government 
was to expire monday the two sides agreed to meet again june 79 
in managua 
there is no alternative to extending the ceasefire said 
luis rivas leiva of the contra delegation we do not want to 
start shooting again 
president daniel ortega has declared a unilateral 30day 
extension of the truce on the part of his government 
gen ortega the defense minister and the presidents brother 
blamed bermudez for the failure of the talks saying he came here 
to prevent an agreement 
bermudez who reportedly opposes a permanent ceasefire 
recently resisted an attempt by several members of the contra 
directorate to fire him 
as talks resumed saturday the sandinistas offered to discuss in 
the national dialogue political reforms demanded in a contra 
proposal presented at the opening session thursday 
it presumably would involve meetings with opposition and other 
groups representing the major elements of nicaraguan society 
government negotiators said the process would follow 
establishment of a permanent truce 
delegates agreed early saturday on the need to extend the 
ceasefire there also appeared to be general agreement on 
technical points dealing with verification of the truce movement 
of rebel fighters to safe zones and plans for a general amnesty 
gen ortega announced the sandinista agreement to discuss 
reforms 
among the rebel demands are political pluralism separation of 
state powers human rights freedom of expression association and 
religion the right to strike and the creation of an electoral 
system that will guarantee free and honest elections in 1990 
the government also said it wanted to discuss the function of a 
mixed economy in nicaragua including different forms of ownership 
contra leaders say the sandinistas are leading the country to a 
marxist system of government and economy 
a government source said the sandinistas have made many 
concessions it is up to the contras to sign the document 
gen ortega said considerable progress had been made in the 
talks 
he said the government urged the contras to agree to let the 
panamerican development foundation distribute food and clothing to 
rebel units in ceasefire zones the foundation is linked to the 
organization of american states 
earlier this year the us congress approved 177 million in 
humanitarian aid for the rebels 
rivas leiva said future negotiations would be difficult because 
they must deal with interpretations of such terms as press freedom 
and with the political conditions necessary for democracy 
for example the contras feel the government must dismantle the 
partystate structure which they say gives the sandinista national 
liberation front total control over the government and army

soviet union 
so far i dont understand to be honest i am really shocked 
and i cant believe it has really happened she said saturday 
night in a telephone interview from her daughters house in north 
palm beach of course im superstitious i worry about the plane 
the trip 
she said she believed the timing of the decision was tied to 
president reagans moscow summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev which starts sunday 
of course its because of the summit and because of the 
pressure of the american government said ms vileshina who met 
with secretary of state george p shultz on monday in washington 
about her husbands situation 
i was waiting eight years for this happy moment in my life i 
started to cry my body was shaking i was so happy ms vileshina

the call from the state department her 7yearold son eric has 
never met his grandfather

some socalled divided spouses mrs abovich said 
she said the family called pakenas after receiving the news and 
hell try to get out as soon as possible

judge from other peoples cases anywhere from two weeks to up to 
six weeks it really depends on the paperwork 
the last six months especially after this last summit in 
december were the most difficult mrs abovich said waiting 
every day every day 
ms vileshina said during her visit with her husband last year 
that he had developed heart trouble and high blood pressure and 
needed better medical treatment than he could get in the soviet 
union 
news of the breakthrough was hailed by sen bob graham dfla 
who had been one of the familys supporters 
she heard very good news today but the real celebration will 
occur when her husband joins his family on free soil graham 
said our goal has been to reunite a family that suffered 
separation long enough

addiction to anabolic steroids 
turned a mildmannered man into a seething volcano of violence 
maintains the defense laywer for a bodybuilder accused of killing 
a hitchhiker 
horace williams 23 is charged with firstdegree murder in the 
september 1986 beating death of michael shane patterson in boca 
raton the trial being taped by a california television production 
company for a series called on trial opened here friday 
pattersons battered naked body was found suspended between two 
poles in a field with his hands tied to one pole and his feet to 
the other he died from severe internal injuries that were 
aggravated by the way he had been tied up says a palm beach county 
medical examiners report 
in his opening statement friday defense lawyer richard lubin 
said he will fashion an insanity defense around expert testimony 
that an 18month regimen of almost daily steroid treatments caused 
williams mental health to deteriorate without him even knowing 
about it 
anabolic steroids synthetic versions of the male hormone 
testosterone are used by some athletes and weightlifters to 
stimulate the production of proteins that increase muscle size and 
strength 
the drugs which are available legally only by prescription 
also are blamed for making users more aggressive 
 
the steroids made williams a powder keg whose delusions 
and mixedup perception made it impossible for him to know that 
the beating he gave patterson caused his death lubin said 
assistant state attorney charles burton called pattersons death 
a gruesome brutal murder in which williams and his friend 
william whitmore 21 tortured their victim for more than 30 
minutes before leaving him for dead 
whitmore pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder earlier this 
month in exchange for a 40year prison sentence 
on the night patterson was killed whitmore introduced his 
friend edward danielson to williams danielson who is not 
charged in the killing testified friday that the three men left 
his house in search of a party 
later they picked up patterson hitchhiking gave him a beer and 
took him to a field danielson said there williams demanded 
money and when patterson said he had no cash williams told him to 
strip danielson testified 
williams shredded pattersons pants and then whitmore and 
williams began punching the man he said 
patterson stood up and tried to run but horace grabbed him 
from behind and stopped him said danielson a navy airman 
stationed in massachusetts 
patterson grabbed a board and tried to hit horace and then 
he took the board and hit patterson on top of the head he 
testified adding that the victim pleaded for his life throughout 
the ordeal 
police have alleged that williams and whitmore also beat 
patterson with a pipe cut hair from his head and underarms and 
rammed his body with a car before tying him up

the weekly said lehmans interview will be included in the 
latest episode of an ocean apart a bbc documentary series on 
britishamerican relations 
britain would have had to have withdraw from the falklands 
if the reagan administration withheld support it quoted lehman as 
saying 
us military aid in the 74day war in which britain recaptured 
the south atlantic archipelago from invading argentine forces has 
been a closely guarded secret the observer said 
lehman is the first senior us official to claim that the 
pentagons supplies of intelligence and material were so great as 
to have been decisive it said 
the newspaper quoted unidentified pentagon sources as saying 
us supplies during the war included 200 sidewinder antiaircraft 
missiles eight stinger antiaircraft systems harpoon antiship 
missiles mortar shells satellite intelligence communications 
facilities and use of a us air base on ascension island 
it said the sources also indicated the us navy would have 
loaned the 12000ton assault ship uss guam if the british aircraft 
carrier invincible was sunk 
in my judgment the outcome would have been very different if 
it werent for the support and the flow of intelligence of 
logistics of technical support of communications and of things 
like sidewinders from the united states to the royal navy the 
observer quoted lehman as saying 
the war killed 712 argentine and 256 british troops 
lehman was quoted as saying that when latin american countries 
learned of the us aid they withdrew support for the usbacked 
rebels fighting nicaraguas sandinista government and washington 
was forced to find alternative means of supplying the rebels 
the argentines and all the other latin americans abruptly 
stopped supporting the efforts of the salvadorans and the contra 
forces against the communists in central america and that led to 
contragate he was quoted as saying 
he apparently was referring to the us funding of nicaraguan 
rebels from profits made from covert arms sales to iran 
lehman was navy secretary from 1981 to 1987 
lord lewin former chief of britains defense staff was quoted 
on the same program as saying that we paid for everything we 
got from the united states and he confirmed the importance of 
us intelligence in winning the war 
lewin was quoted as saying he asked lehman in the us navy 
for an account of the argentine forces operational 
effectiveness he sent me almost a book which was extremely 
useful

podium and some people tried to block protest banners from his 
view 
north a fired national security council aide also jested about 
his status as a major figure in the irancontra affair 
its nice to be somewhere without a subpoena he said 
theres almost as many here as makes up a congressional 
subcommittee 
north who has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to defraud 
the government and of obstructing investigations spoke on 
commitment trust and family 
he made few direct comments on his legal problems but vowed to 
prevail even in washington 
earlier this week the judge in the case said that the 
congressional immunity granted north and two codefendants could 
make trying them on conspiracy charges a practical 
impossibility 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said thursday he hoped to 
decide by the end of june whether to grant defense motions to 
dismiss the indictment 
certainly it was not my intention to be caught in the middle 
of a bitter dispute between the president and the congress over the 
control of our foreign policy north said of the affair but we 
havent been alone in this struggle eithe

a proposed flight from nome to the 
siberian town of provideniya won soviet clearance on saturday but 
it came as such a surprise that the friendship flight dreamed 
2 years ago must be delayed 
soviet officials told gov steve cowper the 240mile flight can 
take place on tuesday the day alaskas organizers of the trip 
proposed months ago 
alaska airlines has to postpone the flight however to ensure 
provideniyas runway can withstand a jet filled with politicians 
business leaders the press and eskimo people seeking reunions with 
siberian kin 
we were aware of the fact that the soviets normally give you 
pretty short notice on decisions like this so it was not a 
surprise that they called four days before it was supposed to 
happen cowper said 
approval of the trip clearly was tied to the moscow summit talks 
between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
cowper said he said he hopes the trip can take place in june 
cowper said the clearance of a flight for tuesday was 
particularly surprising because he thought soviet officials were 
concerned the journey would draw some attention away from the 
summit 
alaska airlines hopes to send technical staff to provideniya in 
a twinengine plane on tuesday airline spokesman jim johnson said 
permission for the preflight was sought through diplomatic 
channels on saturday 
they the soviets gave us some information about the runway 
but we need to see first hand if its suitable for a jet johnson 
said 
nome businessman jim stimpfle has been pushing the trip for 2 
years he said he used to stand on a bering sea beach and wonder 
what was going across the water in the soviet union 
people in nome remember how he used to send balloons containing 
gum and sewing needles over the ocean in hopes they would reach 
people on siberias chukotsk peninsula 
its been a day that i think we will all remember and 
hopefully it will be the beginning of many good things between the 
soviet union and the people of alaska stimpfle said saturday 
alaska airlines wants to use a boeing 737 for the 25minute 
flight from nome to provideniya and is hopes that with only about 
70 passengers instead of the usual 111 and luggage provideniyas 
rustic runway will handle the plane 
airline officials have been told the runway is between 1600 and 
1800 meters and has a surface of gravel and sand but theyve also 
heard it described as a dirt landing strip they want to see it 
for themselves johnson said 
he said the flight can be arranged quickly once the runway 
conditions are known plans call for a morning departure from nome 
an early dinner in provideniya and an evening flight back to nome 
across the bering sea 
the trip has become one of the more attentiongetting components 
of alaskas effort to establish ties and possibly eventual trade 
with the soviet union 
several weeks ago gorbachevs chief spokesman gennadi 
gerasimov spoke optimistically in alaska about the prospects for 
warmer relations between the neighbors 
passengers aboard the flight are expected to include eskimos 
separated from their kin for decades by the political chill between 
the united states and the soviet union 
alaska airlines is hoping the flight will be more than a media 
event and is interested in offering regular service to 
provideniyas peninsula

an atlas of avoidable death 
published by the european economic community showed that more than 
1 percent of deaths in the eec involving illness and childbirth are 
avoidable officials said friday 
paolo fasella the eecs head of science research and 
development said the survey tried to use mortality data as a means 
to study the health services within the eec 
the editor of the 356page book british professor walter 
holland said the number of avoidable deaths in the eec is very 
small indeed 
fasella said it amounts to about 50000 deaths a year 
holland said given the proper medical attention or public health 
action the diseases surveyed should result in very few if any 
deaths 
the survey looked at 17 illnesses including appendicitis 
hodgkins disease womb cancer tuberculosis asthma deaths 
resulting from childbirth and infant mortality 
holland cautioned that the figures only served to indicate the 
existence of problems in the eecs health sector not their nature 
the atlas cannot provide any answers but it points to areas 
for investigation he said 
he said the causes of high mortality rates were extremely 
complex but the statistics showed clearly there was no 
correlation between the money spent the organization of health 
services and the death rate in each member state 
holland head of the department of community medicine at the 
united medical and dental schools of guys and st thomass 
hospitals in london stressed a high death rate for the same 
disease in two different areas did not mean the same problem 
existed in both areas 
it merely indicates there may be a problem he said 
as an example he said deaths from womb cancer could be due to 
insufficient public health information or the unavailability of 
screening tests in that area 
only 10 of the 12 eec member states were surveyed for the atlas 
the books statistics date from 197478 spain and portugal joined 
the trade bloc in 1986

japan will seek to end a deadlock in talks with the 
united states on opening its market to foreign beef by offering new 
import duties instead of steep surcharges a japanese newspaper 
reported friday 
yomiuri shimbun said japan would offer to raise the current 25 
percent duty on imported beef to more than 70 percent its 
previous proposal rejected by us negotiators was to impose an 
additional 75 percent surcharge which would have doubled the price 
of foreign beef when sold on the japanese market 
the surcharge would have gone to a semiofficial corporation and 
be used to stabilize domestic beef prices and aid japanese farmers 
the newspaper said the new offer will be made in workinglevel 
talks in washington next week and represents japans ultimate 
compromise proposal it said the new tariff rate would continue 
for at least three years and would compensate for removal of 
present import quotas 
japanese government officials have said duties or surcharges are 
needed to protect japanese farmers if quotas are eliminated 
an official of the ministry of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries speaking on condition of anonymity said he could 
neither confirm or deny the report 
a fouryear japanus agreement setting annual increases in 
japanese import quotas on beef and citrus imports expired in march 
no new agreement has been reached in talks since then including 
talks in washington last month between agriculture minister takashi 
sato and us trade representative clayton yeutter 
sato refused to comply with a us demand that japan specify a 
short timetable for an end to the import quotas on the two items 
and sharply reduce the level of the proposed duties and surcharges 
on may 4 the united states took its case to the general 
agreement on trade and tariffs an international trade body based 
in geneva prime minister noboru takeshita and other japanese 
officials say they want to continue to seek a solution through 
bilateral talks

kim and greg williams in the way of twins grew up doing almost 
everything together for the past four years however they endured 
life apart cadets in different uniforms at rival military 
academies 
on wednesday kim becomes an air force second lieutenant and 
her brother who graduated from the naval academy last week and was 
commissioned a reserve second lieutenant in the air force will 
administer her oath 
theres no one id rather have do it said kim 
at 1201 am wednesday about 12 hours before the air force 
academy graduation at colorado springs colo greg will swap his 
reserve commission to be a regular air force officer following his 
lifelong desire to fly and a hope to be stationed eventually with 
his twin 
the twins 21 from fort walton beach fla are the children of 
a career officer retired air force lt col james r williams he 
performed swearingin honors for greg at the naval academy ceremony 
in annapolis md on may 25 
the twins says a healthy rivalry got them into and through the 
military academies 
greg the one who wanted to fly all his life but whose eyesight 
wasnt good enough for him to be a pilot says hes happy kim was 
the one accepted by the air force academy he plans to be a 
navigator 
shell probably be a colonel before im a colonel he said 
shes a hard worker she deserves it 
said kim the older of the two by 10 minutes i felt kind of 
bad because greg wanted to be a pilot so bad if i could give him 
my eyes i would 
the twins say their separate strengths have made it easier for 
them to share each others successes 
greg graduated in the top 5 percent of his class at the naval 
academy and says studying comes easier to him he plays a lot of 
sports but concedes that kim who played softball for the air force 
academy and managed the womens basketball team for three years is 
the family athlete 
their three older siblings are tony 31 who works for care in 
new york city kaye miller 28 married to an air force officer in 
florida and janet 26 who enlisted in the air force and serves in 
wiesbaden west germany 
greg still remembers when the two played little league baseball 
she was playing first base and i was in the outfield people 
used to kid me and i said can you beat her out of first base 
and no one could he said 
when kim made the little league allstars greg went and cheered 
her on 
he kept up the cheering she said when she was ready to drop 
out of the air force academy during a difficult first year 
hes probably the biggest influence on what i do said kim 
i thought about quitting and i guess the biggest thing was 
my mom said what will greg think he always says do what 
you want to do but keep the longterm goals in mind 
kim said having a twin brother also helped her cope better than 
some other female cadets with lingering discrimination at the 
academy 
we played sports together growing up we did everything 
together and i played with his friends probably more that i did 
with the females thats probably helped me adjust better and put 
up with the criticism around here she said 
for greg the fouryear separation taught independence 
according to the twins mother julia williams who said in high 
school kim had tended to look after him to make sure his shoes 
were polished 
i still do said kim 
through their academy years the twins telephoned each other 
every couple weeks and spent summers and vacations together each 
fall they sat together at the navyair force football game 
despite occasional loneliness they said they probably helped 
each other better from a distance because they didnt hit the same 
bumps at the same times 
together in the air force they face more separation 
second lt kim williams will begin pilot training at columbus 
air force base miss this fall while 2nd lt greg williams 
enters navigator training at mather air force base calif 
they say they would love to fly together someday but the air 
force doesnt allow siblings in the same aircraft 
hopefully one day well get stationed in the same place 
said greg 
but when football season comes around he added hell probably 
always root for navy

the strong showing in the french presidential 
elections of national front leader jeanmarie le pen has lent 
encouragement to others in western europe who share his 
nationalistic antiimmigrant views 
le pens main campaign theme france for frenchmen contended 
that an influx of immigrants mainly arabs from north africa was 
diluting french traditions and adding to the nations economic and 
social problems 
he is said to be planning to take his message to other european 
countries 
after le pen won more than 14 percent of the vote in 
presidential balloting april 24 extreme right wing parties in 
belgium italy greece and elsewhere expressed hope that his 
success would be contagious the national front now holds 35 seats 
in the 577member french national assembly 
chrysanthos dimitriades a member of the european parliament and 
of greeces extreme right national political union told the 
associated press that le pens gains improved our spirit there 
has been a positive change 
the belgium national front a sister to the french party got 
hundreds of phone calls from people who wanted to join after the 
april 24 vote said party spokesman daniel feret 
basically we heard from people who share our ideas but thought 
we were a marginal party le pen changed that he said 
le pens campaign subtly conveyed the message that darkskinned 
foreigners are invaders who undermine the french way of life and 
take jobs his speeches tapped a vague mostly unarticulated 
feeling that france is on the decline its traditions in jeopardy 
and its national identity threatened 
he kept the immigration issue at the center of his campaign 
suggesting legal measures to encourage immigrants in france to move 
elsewhere and limiting the number of immigrant children in schools 
he appealed to nationalistic sentiments and authoritarian values 
favoring restoration of the death penalty and the quarantining of 
aids victims 
europes extreme right parties share a common desire to convert 
concern about immigration into votes but they have yet to come 
near getting the kind the success le pens national front received 
in france even though their countries face economic and social 
problems similar to those of the french 
some of the parties have registered some successes but others 
remain far out on the fringe with little or no representation in 
their respective parliaments and little chance right now of 
influencing governments 
in greece for example dimitriades national political union 
won just 06 percent of the vote in the last national elections in 
1985 and that represented a drop from the 23 percent it won in 
the european parliament vote a year earlier while dimitriades won 
a seat in the european parliament in strasbourg his party remains 
out of parliament at home 
belgiums national front also has no representation in the 
nations 212seat house of representatives and is so far out on the 
fringes that it does not figure in publicopinion polls 
le pens national front holds 35 just seats in frances 
577member national assembly but he himself has been gaining over 
the years from 074 percent of the vote in the 1974 presidential 
election 11 percent in the 1984 european parliament balloting to 
144 percent in april 
gianfranco fini secretary of the vaguely neofascist italian 
social movement is optimistic about the outcome in france 
he maintains immigrants pose a grave threat to all european 
countries 
unemployment in italy is 124 percent and yet immigrants from 
africa and asia come ashore at the rate of 50000 a year although 
90000 foreigners were legally registered in october 1987 
unofficial estimates put the number of illegal immigrants at 
800000 racial animosity has risen in italy along with the 
immigration 
finis party won 59 percent of the vote in parliamentary 
elections last june it holds 35 seats in the 630member chamber of 
deputies making it italys fourth largest party but it does not 
figure prominently in the shaping of italian governments or 
policies 
even so foreign workers are an issue in italy the largest 
daily newspaper la repubblica published a survey in early may of 
high school students that it said indicated open hostility 
toward immigrants 
seventy percent of those responding said they would favor a 
partial or total closing of borders to foreigners who rob us of 
work 
in france an intellectual new right is providing a 
theoretical framework for neofascism socalled revisionist 
historians are publishing works that reexamine the country under 
nazi occupation and question whether the extermination of 6 million 
jews during world war ii actually occurred 
le pen referred to the gassing of jews in nazi death camps as 
a detail of history 
similarly in italy a spate of books and articles is reassessing 
the italy of dictator benito mussolini in the years before and 
during world war ii a leading mussolini historian has suggested 
that laws forbidding the reestablishment of the fascist party 
are anachronistic 
le pen visited rome on may 8 taking his message to a cheering 
crowd at an italian social movement meeting he plans similar trips 
around europe in the coming months said his spokesman alain vizier 
but le pens presence already has been felt abroad 
mogens glistrip leader of the denmarks antiimmigration 
progress party is frequently referred to in the press as the local 
le pen 
in danish parliamentary elections in may glistrips party took 
16 of the legislatures 179 seats up from 9 it was the second big 
gain in a row for the party which had increased its holdings from 
6 in another election last september 
norways carl i hagen also is compared to le pen he leads the 
norwegian branch of the progress party that won 122 percent of the 
popular vote in local elections last fall recent opinion polls 
give the party 15 to 23 percent making it norways second largest 
party after the governing labor party 
hagen advocates limiting immigration based on the availablity of 
housing and jobs 
political analyst ole borre of denmarks aarhus university said 
the swing to the right in denmark and norway is part of an 
international trend 
some observers contend le pens success is unique a product of 
the twotier french election process and the candidates 
personality 
greeces dimitriades says groups like his pose no immediate 
challenge to existing european democracies 
there is a swing toward conservatism in europe dimitriades 
said but its too early to say if it is swinging into our 
sphere

a backlash against third world immigrants along 
with incidents of antisemitism has caused serious concern about 
racism in italy and provoked a flood of commentaries in the 
national media 
in a recent highly publicized incident an africanborn woman 
was chased off a bus in rome by a crowd after one passenger told 
her to leave the seats to the whites 
other cases of hostility have been reported toward refugees 
gypsies and jews 
the incidents have raised the question of whether italy is 
feeling the effects of the antiimmigrant movement in neighboring 
france led by extreme rightwing politician jeanmarie le pen 
italy has an estimated 800000 immigrants from developing 
countries mainly in africa and the far east only 90000 are 
legally registered according to the interior ministry 
for the first time in history italy has become a country 
capable of attracting foreign labor said sociologist franco 
ferrarotti were not used to that or equipped for that 
he contends that italians are not racist by nature that in 
general they have a terrific amount of tolerance verging on 
indifference but he said italians are becoming increasingly 
prone to racial discrimination partly as a result of the nations 
124 percent unemployment rate 
there is a growing amount of social discrimination based on 
ethnic perceptions mostly motivated by a feeling of scarcity of 
jobs ferrarotti said in an interview italians are haunted by 
the ghost of unemployment 
but countering the argument that immigrants are stealing jobs is 
the fact that they usually take work that italians dont want 
they quickly go to the bottom of the pile ferrarotti said 
theyre lucky if they end up washing cars 
for italians racism has long been considered someone elses 
problem newspapers have reported extensively on racial troubles in 
the united states and france 
italian media nevertheless display an obsession with racial 
differences gratuitously referring to nonwhites by their race 
often as uomo di colore colored man newspapers have run 
headlines such as oro nero black gold on stories about black 
olympic athletes winning gold medals or pericolo giallo 
yellow peril about rival asian soccer teams 
the case that brought the issue close to home involved the woman 
on the bus 37yearold amete debretzion a refugee from wartorn 
eritrea province in ethiopia 
the woman who has lived in italy for 14 years and is an italian 
citizen said she was sitting in the bus with her child on her lap 
when a man approached her and said get u negress leave the 
seats to the whites 
mrs debretzion said virtually all the other passengers 
supported the man joining in with their own racial slurs and 
comments such as get out of italy she got off the bus 
she appeared a few weeks later on national television to accept 
personal apologies from mayor nicola signorello of rome 
only a few days before the bus incident newspapers published a 
survey of rome high school students showing that 70 percent favored 
the closure of italys borders to immigrants 
of the 5500 polled 263 percent said immigrants steal 
jobs 242 percent said they are terrorists 61 percent 
described them as thieves and drug pushers and 26 percent 
said they carry diseases five percent of the students openly 
declared themselves racist 
yousef salman leader of the federation of the organization of 
foreigners communities in italy attributes the rise in racial 
incidents on people who blame immigrants for all of societys ills 
you always have the image of the poor sick african coming to 
steal work said salman who came to italy 15 years ago from 
jordan as a student but there are foreigners with energy and 
capacities that should not be overlooked there are doctors 
lawyers engineers men of culture and science who have helped 
italy economically 
recent incidents of antisemitism death threats painting of 
swastikas on walls and the bombing of a jewish bookstore in turin 
have alarmed italys jewish community of 40000 and strained 
relations with the roman catholic church 
jewish leaders have charged that the italian press including 
catholic publications have helped incite antisemitism through 
their reporting on israels policies toward the palestinians 
italys roman catholic bishops responded with a public letter 
condemning antisemitism and urging catholics to distinguish 
between the jewish people and the policies of the israeli 
government and political parties 
romans have also displayed hostility toward the 3000 gypsies 
living in makeshift housing around the city for more than a month 
last year residents camped out on railroad tracks and set up 
burning roadblocks to protest city plans to establish encampments 
for gypsies in their neighborhoods 
last year the government passed an amnesty law for illegal 
aliens if foreigners came forward to register themselves they 
would be given a residence permit and granted the same rights and 
benefits as italian citizens 
only 90000 of the 800000 immigrants registered most preferred 
to stay underground rather than risk losing their jobs with 
employers unwilling to make the required social security payments 
most immigrants coming to italy stay for only a few years to 
earn some money before returning to their homelands 
ferrarotti the sociologist maintained that a movement like le 
pens in france would not find broad support in italy because 
italians dont have the frenchs strong sense of nationalistic 
identity 
but salman said le pen has given life to hidden feelings 
against foreigners in italy

long before cape cods annual summer 
tourist migration started this memorial day weekend resort 
operators had put aside weather almanacs for wantads 
their big concern finding enough help 
if you dont get good service you dont have a good vacation 
you have hell said walter goodwin owner of the 400seat 
grandmas restaurant in bourne 
already employers are making special arrangements to hire 
foreign workers from as far away as brazil and the philippines and 
college students and older people from colorado and texas are 
arriving by the score to claim the jobs 
even so there are too few hands to go around and the problem 
is not new goodwin said he lost 8000 a week last summer when he 
had to shut part of his dining room he could not calculate how 
much was lost due to overworked and shorttempered waitresses 
over at the 261room sheraton hyannis night manager edward 
dennis sometimes finds himself pushing a vacuum cleaner and working 
in the kitchen just to keep things moving 
were getting busier but the help situation is getting 
worse said dennis if it doesnt get any better people coming 
down to the cape arent going to come back you cant just start 
giving excuses to the guests 
the problem is even hitting the beaches in orleans a shortage 
of lifeguards might restrict swimming and crimp parking revenues 
the problem comes as no surprise nationwide the pool of 
prospective workers aged 1725 usually college students is 
shrinking and on the cape the steep cost of housing with monthly 
rents starting at 600 scares many away 
but local restaurateurs hoteliers and others in the leisure 
industry were galvanized into action by a report last november that 
said 14000 seasonal and yearround jobs on the cape and nearby 
islands went vacant last year the list included spots that 
employers would have created if workers had been available the 
report estimated the worker shortage translated into 47 million in 
lost revenue 
there is now widespread fear that the traditional peak 
mayoctober will bring ruinous results in 1988 said the report 
by the cape and islands labor shortage task force based on a 
survey of 254 businesses the report on labor trends was 
commissioned by a coalition of the new bedford cape cod and 
islands private industry council the office for job partnerships 
and the cape cod chamber of commerce 
in an effort to find workers and keep them business groups this 
year held job fairs instituted onestop job shops that offer 
employment plus housing and appealed to local residents to open 
their homes there also were mass mailings to colleges and 
universities in the midwest and southwest said michael frucci 
executive director of the cape cod chamber of commerce 
some took action on their own motels turned rooms into 
dormitories and one restaurant chain bought houses to convert into 
worker dorms 
a hyannis company is offering to untangle the red tape to allow 
brazilians to get temporary work permits and restaurants and hotels 
to legally employ them 
local employment specialists estimate at least 3000 foreigners 
chiefly brazilian and irish are already working illegally on cape 
cod but the immigration and naturalization service says it will 
crack down this summer 
the honeymoon is over as far as the cape is concerned said 
timothy whelan deputy director of the boston ins office 
a oneyear grace period began last june 1 when citations were 
issued to employers found using illegal aliens starting wednesday 
employers risk fines of 250 to 10000 per employee for repeated 
offenses after the third offense they risk criminal charges 
employers can apply for temporary certificates to employ 
foreigners for seasonal work if they can prove no americans can be 
found to do the job whelan said the ins had received 600700 
applications for the certificates which must also go through the 
department of labor and most were approved 
but there still is housing to contend with 
when goodwin the owner of grandmas counted up 50 job 
vacancies for this summer and only 12 applicants he bought a 
150000 threefamily home to house workers he also made deals 
with local motel owners the motels will rent their 70anight 
rooms to goodwins staffers for just 75 per person per week 
provided they do their own housekeeping 
theres a little bit of desperation frucci said noting 
that inquiries from potential vacationers were up from last year 
he credited a robust economy in the east and the dollars decline 
which makes a vacation at home more appealing than an overseas trip 
and also lures canadians over the border 
krista hayes employer services manager for the office of job 
partnerships said she was encouraged by the results of efforts to 
find workers 
we showed the employers there are labor sources locally and 
out of state we talked about labor certification for foreign 
temporary summer workers mrs hayes said many have been 
approved and have their foreign workers here a lady from colorado 
has brought students here i just cant help but say its got to be 
better than last year

ferris wheel in wildwood or pushing a rolling chair in atlantic 
city 
whereas a lot of american students take time off in the summer 
to travel the majority of students who come here on a visa have to 
work to make money for schooling said cathy burke owner of the 
irish pub in atlantic city she regularly hires several irish 
students for her restaurant and 100room inn 
they come here with a purpose and a good strong work ethic 
she said theyre quality people 
to assist the students many employers provide housing or help 
them find rooms in local inns and rooming houses ms burke puts up 
many of her foreign students at her inn 
its kind of like ellis island around here she said 
several agencies in the united states and abroad help foreign 
students obtain visas to work for the summer and often provide 
inexpensive chartered flights some employers such as erwin 
travel overseas to interview candidates and sign notes promising 
jobs so they can obtain visas 
of the 600 seasonal employees at casino pier and the adjoining 
water works water park about 70 will come from ireland france and 
spain erwin said they can legally arrive on june 1 and must leave 
by oct 19 he said 
the general manager of mariners landing amusement pier in 
wildwood also regularly travels to ireland to interview students 
this year we expect to have about 75 foreign students out of 
the 250 people we hire for our water park and pier said 
spokeswoman jacqueline palumbo the students are from israel 
turkey china england and france 
we would have no trouble getting american students because 
were in a great location she said but weve found that there 
is a strong desire among foreign students to work here because they 
are really in need of employment 
not all seasonal employers at the seashore are willing to help 
reduce unemployment in foreign countries however ronald stokes 
general manager of stokes laundry inc in wildwood crest said he 
concentrates his recruiting efforts on universities in this country 
weve had irish students before and they didnt last all 
summer he said they like to take off the last two or three 
weeks to travel at least with college students here you know they 
leave around labor day 
in addition stokes said many foreign students work two or 
three jobs while theyre here to make a lot of money but then they 
bug out and get tired yet theyll stay and visit this country 
until their visas expire 
larry e belfer who hires many foreign students each summer to 
push his atlantic city famous rolling chairs says they often come 
to the united states to learn the language and learn the 
culture 
but belfer has been so successful with his foreign students that 
he has set up an agency to refer others to seasonal jobs in the 
area three casinos have already signed on 
they cant work in the casino because it takes too long to get 
licensed but they can take jobs in the casinos hotel and 
restaurants belfer said 
hopefully well have a nice little marriage here he said 
im not trying to take away from local labor but this provides a 
nice buffer for the summer crunch

after tuesday american businesses from the 
loftiest fortune 500 company to the smallest corner grocery wont 
get just a warning the first time theyre caught employing illegal 
immigrants 
companies tempted to look the other way when illegal aliens 
apply could face stiff fines the real teeth in the landmark 1986 
immigration reform bill that enters a new phase june 1 
the immigration and naturalization service will target key 
industries looking for violators 
it is a system that has worked in europe and many feel it 
offers the best hope to curb illegal immigration and transfer jobs 
from aliens to us citizens 
but others worry about possible exploitation of illegal workers 
discrimination against foreignappearing workers the impact on the 
labor force and the dangers of turning employers into immigration 
police 
doris meissner a former acting ins commissioner questions 
whether employer sanctions might put into our employment 
practices a bias toward looking at peoples foreignness that never 
existed before 
it may be too early to gauge whether that is true but the 
monetary impact will certainly be felt right away 
after wednesday the ins need no longer issue an initial warning 
citation to employers who hire undocumented workers the law now 
requires employers to obtain documents from workers showing they 
are legally in this country 
employers face fines of up to 1000 for improper documentation 
up to 2000 per alien for a first offense of knowingly hiring an 
illegal alien up to 5000 per alien for the second offense 
10000 for subsequent offenses and 3000 or six months in jail 
for a pattern or practice of violation 
over the past year ins fined 80 businesses 350000 and gave 
2000 citations the agency thus views the new phase not as a 
dramatic crackdown but as a nudge to employers the fines went to 
companies that got warnings but continued ignoring the law 
our intent is not to indiscriminately run around fining 
employers the intent is to encourage employers to validate their 
work force says ins spokesman duke austin itll be a 
deliberate implementation of the law 
although ins is beefing up its investigative force agents will 
not be able to inspect every business austin says the agency will 
use its resources judiciously targeting the construction 
garment and hotel and service industries that have traditionally 
been repositories of illegal workers 
in europe where many countries adopted employer sanctions a 
decade ago the system did not trigger widespread job 
discrimination against foreigners according to a 1987 study by the 
center for immigration studies a private think tank that 
researches immigration trends 
the study concluded that cooperation by employers is vital for 
such a system and said employers would cooperate if the paperwork 
wasnt burdensome and if enforcement was consistent and certain 
its got to take on the aura of the irs says vernon m 
briggs jr a labor economist at cornell university most people 
are probably reasonably honest in doing their income tax because 
theres a fair chance theyre going to get caught everybody 
worries about the irs but i dont think anybody is worried about 
the ins yet 
businesses were skeptical last year about the i9 forms they 
were required to fill out for workers a new and costly level of 
paperwork now they seem less resistant if still wary 
virginia lamp thomas labor attorney for the us chamber of 
commerce says businesses are afraid that the law has significant 
teeth in it 
the chamber is conducting a survey to determine how the law is 
working some experts have made preliminary assessments 
employer sanctions will probably work best in the larger firms 
and will work least effectively as you get down to the mom and pop 
enterprises that dont pay much anyhow and need the cheap illegal 
labor to survive says david simcox director of the center for 
immigration studies 
briggs the labor economist says employer sanctions probably 
will not be very effective because employers really dont have to 
verify the workers documents 
anything that a worker shows an employer that appears to be 
reasonable essentially takes the employers off the hook i think 
its likely to make a mockery out of the ability to enforce the 
bill he says 
the amnesty phase of the law in which illegal aliens who came 
to the united states before 1982 could apply for temporary 
residency enlarged the pool of legal workers available for 
lowpaying jobs 
employers have got the windfall of having additional pools of 
lowwage workers which means they dont have to modernize or raise 
wages in order to make jobs more attractive briggs says 
the potential for worker exploitation concerns civil liberties 
advocates 
the law grandfathered in workers who had jobs on nov 6 
1986 the date it was passed that means that employers did not 
have to ask those workers for documents although illegal workers 
in that category remain subject to deportation if caught by ins 
now the worry is that those workers can be trapped in their jobs 
with no redress against an unscrupulous employer 
obviously for these employees it totally removes their ability 
to make any kind of changes if there is a bad employment situation 
theyd be very reluctant to change jobs because they dont have 
documents it sets up a situation amenable to exploitation says 
meissner now with the carneigie endowment for international peace 
which studies foreign policy issues 
there is also the issue of job discrimination the law bars 
employers from refusing to hire someone because of their national 
origin or in the case of someone who has taken steps to become a 
citizen his citizenship status it sets up a special justice 
department counsel to prosecute complaints 
so far 139 discrimination allegations have been filed with that 
office fortyeight have been resolved or are being investigated 
of those 15 have resulted in formal complaints and 10 have been 
settled by requiring back pay with offers of employment 
but that may not tell the whole story the law also allows 
employers to hire us citizens over noncitizens if the two 
individuals are equally qualified 
thats going to make it even more difficult to prove 
discrimination equally qualified is to a certain degree 
subjective says mario moreno of the mexicanamerican legal 
defense and educational fund which provides legal assistance to 
mexicanamericans and others involved in employment discrimination 
suits or complaints 
the general accounting office an investigative branch of 
congress last fall found little evidence that employers were 
discriminating against foreignlooking job applicants because of 
the new law but those findings are only preliminary 
the law was intended to discourage illegal immmigration by 
drying up the job prospects for such aliens whether that will 
happen remains to be seen 
there will be some job market for illegals because there will 
be employers who wont comply says meissner the question then 
becomes to what extent over time does the governments effort bring 
about real voluntary compliance on the part of employers and some 
deterrence

recent events on wall street have taken a lot of 
the suspense out of the various periodic government reports on the 
state of the economy 
followers of the stock market are familiar with the usual 
routine investors set their sights on a forthcoming report 
regarding something like the trade deficit and try to anticipate 
what it will look like 
if when the number arrives it is better than expected stock 
prices rally if it falls short of expectations the market falls 
the exercise can get convoluted at times on the theory that 
what looks good for the current economy might actually be an 
ominous portent for interest rates inflation and the business 
outlook at some point in the future 
lately however the game has been simplified if the trade 
deficit rises stocks fall if the trade deficit narrows well 
stocks also fall 
as jack lavery research director at merrill lynch put it 
recently good news is bad news and bad news is bad news 
however perverse that may sound longtime students of the stock 
market say it is neither unprecedented nor illogical 
the relationship between stocks and the economic news is often 
tenuous they say if investors are sufficiently fearful they may 
well find an ostensibly positive development uninspiring 
in fact traders who want to lighten their stock holdings may 
seize on good news as an opportune moment to sell 
john mendelson an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc said he 
was surprised by the number of puzzled queries that arose when the 
stock market fell may 17 even though the commerce department 
reported that the trade deficit shrank to 975 billion in march 
in our view he said the message of the tape was simply 
that this is a bear market 
added thom brown chairman of the investment policy committee at 
butcher amp singer inc in philadelphia 
today as in most earlier bear markets investors are ignoring 
the positive factors on the fundamental front for example 
earnings for most of the basic industry companies are good and 
getting better 
but it doesnt necessarily follow that this strength will be 
reflected in stock prices near term 
for a precedent of this sort of thing brown cited the behavior 
of the stock of bethlehem steel in 1973 and 1974 when the market 
suffered through a long period of disfavor 
at the end of 1972 when bethlehem posted earnings of 302 a 
share and paid 120 a share in dividends the stock stood at about 
30 he recalled 
at the end of 1974 when the companys earnings climbed to 785 
a share and the dividend to 230 the stock was down to 23 
the lesson here is obvious during a bull market surprises in 
stock prices are likely to be on the upside in bear markets the 
reverse is usually the case brown said 
with all the woes bear markets may bring brown and other 
analysts observe they may also present special opportunities for 
longterm investors 
after all the ideal time to buy stocks in the past has been 
when their prices were depressed especially when bear markets have 
gone to extremes 
spotting these special buying opportunities is no easy 
assignment as most marketwatchers readily concede by the time a 
bear market gets close to a bottom the economic news often looks 
so bad that hardly anybody wants even to consider buying stocks 
still one signal many wall streeters watch for as a likely 
portent that a bear market is ending when the stock market stops 
paying attention to bad news or even starts finding ways to 
interpret it as positive

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev appears to 
be moving toward significant easing of restrictions on the russian 
orthodox church on its 1000th anniversary this year according to 
us and canadian experts on soviet religious affairs 
it is unclear however whether gorbachevs new way of dealing 
with the orthodox church signals substantially improved conditions 
for other religious groups in the soviet union 
on monday during his summit visit president reagan was 
scheduled to visit the danilov monastery outside moscow seat of 
the orthodox churchs patriarchate to symbolize our concern for 
religious freedom said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
word reached the presidential party late last week in helsinki 
finland that the soviets had questioned the participation of one 
of the religious groups that are to meet with reagan at the 
monastery fitzwater said he did not know which religious group 
prompted the soviet objection the meeting he said is still on 
as far as i know 
reagan recently cited the first signs of progress toward 
religious freedom in the soviet union 
he noted that some religious dissidents have been allowed to 
emigrate some new churches have been organized and soviet 
authorities have announced they will permit the printing of 100000 
bibles 
these are encouraging signs and we welcome them the 
president told a white house conference may 3 what we hope for 
ultimately is a willingness to see continued change in the spirit 
of glasnost when it comes to matters of religion 
peter reddaway director of the kennan institute for advanced 
russian studies in washington said he is impressed by gorbachevs 
meeting with leaders of the russian orthodox church on april 29 to 
appeal for their support 
reddaway said it apparently was the first such meeting since 
1943 when stalin conferred with church leaders to help rally the 
country against nazi germany during world war ii 
taking part in the most recent kremlin session were patriarch 
pimen head of the orthodox church metropolitan filaret of kiev 
and galitsky and other members of the holy synod the churchs 
governing body 
gorbachev told them that a new law on freedom of conscience 
was being drafted to reflect the tangible results of new 
approaches to statechurch relations in the conditions of 
perestroika and democratization 
details of the new law have not been announced 
reddaway said there are indications that the new statute will 
include removing the ban on the churchs involvement in charitable 
activities 
if that is indeed the case then to my mind its quite a 
significant and possibly even very significant shift in 
official policy he said 
reddaway said that when he visited moscow in january he learned 
that the russian republics minister of health had called in 
representatives of churches in moscow and told them the time had 
come for the churches to exercise their charitable urges 
the soviet official proposed that each of them should adopt a 
major moscow hospital and provide basic services to patients in 
that hospital apparently the church leaders agreed this is rather 
remarkable reddaway said 
as for other religious denominations reddaway said there are 
some signs that these stillillegal groups are being tolerated de 
facto more than in the past even the ukrainian catholics who 
are the biggest single outlawed church 
unofficial estimates of the number of religious believers in the 
soviet union put the total at upwards of 90 million people this 
includes 40 million to 50 million adherents of the russian orthodox 
church 10 million eastern rite and roman catholics 4 million 
protestants including baptists and pentecostalists 2 million 
jews and tens of millions of moslems 
bohdan bociurkiw a political science professor at carleton 
university in ottawa said churchstate relations under gorbachev 
have dramatically improved for the orthodox church but have not 
improved in relationship to most other churches 
he said the main linkage between the regime and the orthodox 
church is mutual perception of common national interest 
gorbachev is courting russian nationalists hes courting 
believers but he would not make concessions to churches that he 
views as centrifugal that would not fit into that notion of 
russian national interest bociurkiw said its not a change in 
principle but its a pragmatic change in policy 
elan steinberg executive director of the new yorkbased world 
jewish congress said that for soviet jews conditions are better 
than they have been in the past but there is certainly a long way 
yet to go 
steinberg said there has been a major increase in the number of 
soviet jews being allowed to emigrate from fewer than 1000 in 
1986 to about 10000 in the past year and greater access to jewish 
cultural and religious materials 
he said world jewish congress officials recently had positive 
and constructive talks in moscow with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze about soviet jewry the middle east and 
eastwest relations 
kent hill director of the institute on religion and democracy 
a washingtonbased nonprofit research group said an estimated 
160 religious dissidents remain in soviet labor camps or internal 
exile a decline of about 150 since january 1986 
hill said he sensed a relaxation of government restrictions 
during a recent twoweek visit to active churches in the russian 
republic the ukraine latvia and estonia but a wary skeptical 
attitude among many russian orthodox and protestant believers 
unlike some western observers he said they are far more 
cautious in making optimistic projections about the future 
first of all theyre not at all sure gorbachevs position is 
assured they dont know how long hes going to be around hill 
said 
another reason is that in the past they have seen these cycles 
of relaxation be followed by renewed repression

mikhail s gorbachev may be general secretary 
of the avowedly atheistic soviet communist party but that hasnt 
stopped him from referring several times in recent months to god 
and jesus christ 
gorbachev whose mother is a regular churchgoer used a biblical 
allusion during a may 18 interview with the washington post and 
newsweek when seeking to explain the limits on his current drive to 
restructure soviet society 
jesus christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew how 
to feed 20000 jews with five loaves of bread he said we 
dont possess that skill we have no ready prescription to solve 
all our problems quickly 
last december gorbachev invoked gods name during summit talks 
with president reagan in washington 
the soviet leader said his visit had augmented his knowledge 
about the united states 
we discussed with the president that it would be a good thing 
to have more of an informal visit to travel around the country 
and i believe that if the politburo and god are well disposed 
toward me then i might do this without putting it off for too 
long he said

just two weeks after the fbi charged 28 health 
inspectors with extortion for threatening to add restaurants to the 
citys notorious rat list several restaurateurs showed two can 
play that game by trying to bribe their way off the list 
about onethird of the citys health inspectors were indicted 
the fbi and the citys department of investigations found at least 
300 of the citys 15000 or so restaurants were solicited for 
bribes just during its investigation 
some restaurant owners dreaded to see them coming driving up 
in cadillacs and wearing rolex watches said james m fox head 
of the federal bureau of investigation in the city 
the health department was still stinging from the scandal when 
some restaurateurs assumed the cozy handinpocket relationship had 
been only briefly suspended 
two weeks after all the notoriety about the inspection 
scandals six of our inspectors reported that restaurant managers 
and owners tried to bribe them said marvin bogner the citys 
assistant health commissioner 
noting that inspectors usually take off their suit coats and don 
blue work jackets for inspections bogner said one inspector 
noticed the restaurateur putting a wad of bills in his coat pocket 
the inspector took the wad of bills and threw it on the 
kitchen floor 
the bribe attempts offered in late april involved a wide 
spectrum of restaurants ranging from beaneries to bistros said 
bogner he would not name any because the department of 
investigations is looking into the reports 
the most obvious public effect of the crackdown by the fbi and 
the city has been that newspapers stopped publishing the city 
health departments rat list officially and more politely called 
the list of food inspection results 
the newspapers said they could not be sure if a restaurant had a 
legitimate sanitation problem or if the owner had merely resisted 
extortion by health inspectors 
new york gourmets and gourmands had scanned the new york times 
newsday and the daily news weekly with mingled horror and 
fascination fearing that their favorite eatery would be listed 
after they enjoyed a meal there 
a few typical examples 
a restaurant that among other violations had mouse 
droppings flies and an employee smoking while serving 
a bakery cited for having nailpolish remover motorcycle 
oil peroxide paints cough medicines and insecticides on shelves 
near food 
greenwich streets pussycat lounge for of course cats 
kept on premises perhaps it is not a coincidence that the 
restaurants cited for having cats had no rodent droppings and vice 
versa 
a few power lunch spots where the citys movers and 
shakers talk big business have also received violation notices 
in 1982 mimi sheraton then the times restaurant reviewer 
raved about the satiny vinaigrette dressing and bracing 
golden consomme at la cote basque giving it a threestar rating 
the health department panned la cote basque in 1984 citing its 
slimeladen ice cream machine and greasy floor at the 
time the prix fixe luncheon cost 25 
the rat list wasnt always so specific until last autumn it 
just named offending restaurants without citing whether they had 
cats rats or were simply missing necessary operating permits 
a new york times spokeswoman said editors decided to change the 
format of the weekly list to help readers distinguish between major 
and minor health violations 
the satirical monthly magazine spy beat all the dailies by a 
year by providing the real dirt on the citys restaurants beginning 
in october 1986 said joe mastriani the editor in charge of the 
column 
it was a pretty popular feature he added but spy 
dropped it last fall when the newspapers began running the new 
comprehensive rat list 
the new fulldisclosure policy ended in late march when the fbi 
charged that the 28 current and former health department inspectors 
had doubled and tripled their annual salaries of 25000 to 30000 
through extortion

editors note veteran ap reporter bob thomas covered the 
victory party that ended in death for robert kennedy here he 
recalls that night 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after a luncheon in the empire room of the 
ambassador hotel recently i stopped at the passageway to the 
kitchen 
a bus boy was piling dishes and the thought was inescapable 
what a homely place for an event that changed the course of a 
nation 
toward midnight on june 4 1968 i was in the press room 
adjacent to the empire room my assignment for the ap the night of 
the california presidential primary was to cover the leading 
democratic contender robert f kennedy 
the polls had already reported an overwhelming victory for the 
new york senator and kennedy made his acceptance with customary 
eloquence in the empire room 
next he would cut through the kitchen to the press room to 
answer reporters questions but as i waited near the kitchen door 
there was a series of sharp reports like balloons popping 
then screams i rushed toward them 
it was a scene of terror women were wailing men yelling the 
noise reverberated so loudly that i couldnt tell what anyone was 
shouting 
in a corner i could see the athletes rafer johnson and rosey 
grier struggling with someone i had no sense of danger still not 
grasping the reason for the popping sounds i felt detached 
watching the panic as if it were a vivid movie scene 
a cluster of people stood in the center of the room peering 
down with horrified faces i couldnt see what they were looking 
at i jumped up on a stack of kitchen trays 
robert kennedy lay on the floor blood streaming from his head 
blank eyes staring into the void 
after gathering in the nightmarish scene i jumped down and 
rushed to a press room phone it was dead i ran into the hotel 
lobby where i knew there was a row of phone booths i slipped a 
dime into the first phone and couldnt get a dial tone finally i 
was able to reach the office 
bob myers aps san francisco bureau chief who was helping out 
in los angeles answered this is the conversation as he later 
related i dont remember it 
thomas i got a flash kennedy shot 
myers are you serious 
thomas im serious kennedys been shot 
myers did you see it 
thomas no but i saw him lying on the floor 
myers youre sure what exactly did you see 
thomas kennedy lying on the floor of the kitchen hall with 
blood all over his face he had been shot 
as i was dictating the story i heard a commotion in the lobby 
leaning out of the telephone booth i could see a phalanx of los 
angeles policemen hurrying a young man down the marble staircase 
right in front of me i returned to the phone and gave a 
description of the man who turned out to be sirhan sirhan 
after all the dictation i put down the phone with a feeling of 
emptiness and sorrow i walked dazedly toward the kitchen but a 
policeman blocked the entrance to a place that was now part of 
history

robert f kennedy was shot 20 years ago 
as dozens of people stood within arms reach of the assassin yet 
even with all those witnesses many still insist there was more to 
it than the solitary act of the gunman 
the fbi and the los angeles police department have concluded the 
murder was the work of one man 
but conspiracy theorists point to incomplete police files and 
suggest that a second gunman fired at kennedy from behind while 
sirhan sirhan stood in front of him they cite witnesses who 
claimed that sirhan was seen with an unidentified young woman in a 
polka dot dress shortly before the shooting 
those believing in conspiracy turn up regularly at a small 
walledoff section of the southeastern massachusetts university 
library home of the robert f kennedy assassination archives the 
largest collection of its kind 
the majority of people who come to us for information already 
embrace a notion of conspiracy of some kind said phillip h 
melanson a political science professor at the university who also 
heads the archives 
the archives contain the 10000page transcript of sirhans 
trial and thousands of pages of district attorneys files melanson 
and his staff have 8000 pages of the recently declassified 
32000page fbi file of the investigation into the murder and are 
getting the rest add to those 600 hours of audio tape and 5000 
newspaper clippings 
melanson believes sirhan did not act alone he and other 
scholars have been critical of the los angeles police 
investigation suggesting it was haphazard and resulted in the 
destruction of key evidence 
in april melanson said only 400 hours of testimony remained 
preserved on tape in los angeles police files although 
investigators earlier had spoken of thousands of hours of taped 
interviews 
history may have dictated keeping those longer but i was not 
consulted said tom reddin los angeles police chief at the time 
of the assassination who dismisses suggestions of a coverup 
the question you have to ask he said is what the devil 
are we trying to cover up 
his deepest regret reddin said is that someone did not step in 
to keep kennedy from entering the ambassador hotel kitchen where 
sirhan lay in wait 
kennedys entourage insisted on no police protection for his 
appearances in los angeles and no police were present at the 
hotel asked whether the police should have disregarded the 
request reddin said sadly i dont think we should have but i 
wish we did 
even melanson acknowledged that some of those who share his view 
that sirhan did not act alone lack convincing arguments 
certainly there is a group of people who embrace conspiracy 
out of perhaps devotion to the political figure said melanson 
social scientist john clarke of the university of arizona at 
tucson perceived psychological needs behind conspiracy theories 
noting the charismatic appeal of leaders like rfk and his 
brother john f kennedy clarke said thats why a certain number 
of people dont want to let these people go and this curiosity 
about who killed these people is one handle they have on that 
for a tragedy of such magnitude it may be only natural to 
question simple explanations there has got to be a much more 
elaborate background of conspiracy the common error lies in making 
more complex what are simple events said franklin l ford a 
harvard university history professor 
added ford author of political murder from tyrannicide to 
terrorism it is possible to order a mailorder highvelocity 
rifle to kill the president of the united states but the public 
doesnt accept that

moved from east los angeles 14 years before the horrible truth 
came home that night the daughter now a successful career woman 
never returned to that scene but the mother did picketing crack 
houses lecturing gang members and trying to save the children of 
people who didnt care enough to do it themselves 
weve got the la connection and its bad said mcfalls who 
lives in the meadowview neighborhood on sacramentos south side 
for sale signs line her street but mcfalls has no intention 
of running instead she breaks up fights corrals gang members to 
help register voters and urges witnesses to gang violence to 
testify she persuaded two gang members wanted for crimes to 
surrender driving one to juvenile hall herself and baked sweet 
potato pies at the request of another who was being shipped to the 
california youth authority

you can deal with them and they respect you for it too said 
mcfalls who walks amid the bloods red and the crips blue with 
her own colors the black and yellow of the meadowview improvement

away somewhere if you let them know you dont like whats going on 
in your neighborhood theyll move 
some 550 miles north on interstate 5 irine tate never stops 
letting them know how she feels one day last winter she painted 
no drug parking in white block letters down the middle of her 
portland ore street on all four corners along her retaining 
wall and on her neighbors garage door 
they said we live around here we pay rent i said you 
dont pay no damn rent around here so get the hell off my block 
the gang members didnt like the deadhonest drughating tate 
but they had to respect her shed sit on her porch and watch their 
comings and goings listen to their deals and learn all she could 
then shed call the police something her neighbors were afraid to 
do 
tate and mcfalls realize the risks they take in opposing the 
lucrative drug trade mcfalls has a panic box in her home push 
the button and police surround her block within two minutes 
tate owns a bulletproof vest one day a gang member told her it 
wouldnt do any good weve got armorpiercing bullets he 
said if we want you bad enough well get you 
so far the gangs havent wanted to hurt either woman both of 
whom temper fear with faith if god wants you to die then you 
die tate said if god wants me to die with them shooting me 
then im going to die with them shooting me 
one crip tried to buy her silence for 10000 but she wasnt 
selling 
i could have paid my bills off and been sitting pretty if id 
taken that money she said over the drone of a tv soap opera 
and whose life would i have ruined 
id lose my own selfrespect id lose my dignity my pride in 
myself and what would the kids think of me 
the kids see all hear all they know whos cooking whos 
selling and how much theyre asking kids as young as 6 have become 
lookouts and shills who steer crack customers to one gangs house 
and away from a rivals 
the answer say mcfalls and ed elmore another member of the 
meadowview improvement committee is to give kids guidance and 
alternatives give them jobs in the summer and places to go besides 
the streets put back into the community the money and hope that 
crack dealers take out 
a year ago mcfalls street was crowded with gang members 
dealing crack as openly as if they were selling tshirts or 
hamburgers now theyve retreated indoors paying rent to single 
mothers and old people willing to turn their homes into crack 
houses 
four california gang members moved in with one of tates 
neighbors and the young mother now smokes crack and wonders how to 
get rid of her roommates mcfalls gets phone calls in the wee hours 
from a woman who became an addict gave birth to a onepound baby 
and now hears disembodied voices as she aimlessly rides buses 
around the west 
dont you realize what youre doing to your own people an 
infuriated tate once asked a gang member youre ruining their 
minds so they dont know how to think youre killing them 
the crip sat thinking for a long time i guess youre right 
he told her later but i may as well be making the money as 
somebody else

as the crash of 1987 recedes into memory wall 
streeters are sounding a new lament the stock market is too quiet 
fear of the volatility that rocked the markets last fall and in 
early 1988 appears to have created a kind of paralysis leaving 
brokers sitting by idle telephones while their customers watch and 
wait 
by all accounts the crash frightened away not only individual 
investors but also professional managers who work for pensions 
funds and other large pools of money 
in congressional testimony this past week david ruder chairman 
of the securities and exchange commission said institutional money 
managers were suffering from great fear about volatility 
through may 24 trading volume this year on the new york stock 
exchange is running 64 percent behind its pace in 1987 at the 
american stock exchange the dropoff has been 271 percent 
last monday when 10264 million shares were traded was the 
quietest session not affected by a holiday at the big board in 
nearly a year and a half 
the story is much the same in the bond market where inflation 
worries have intensified the postcrash blues david resler 
economist at nomura securities international recently calculated 
that customer transactions for primary dealers in us government 
securities were down 22 percent from their 1987 rate 
the way many analysts see it the outlook doesnt look good for 
an improvement in this situation any time soon with the dog 
days of summer approaching 
from now through labor day anyway its going to be dull 
said raymond f devoe jr at legg mason wood walker inc 
in such a climate morale on wall street is naturally low the 
wall street journal reports that one major investment firm kidder 
peabody amp co is considering putting some of its traders on a 
fourday work week this summer although the firm denies that 
by their very nature traders want immediate gratification 
observed william king head of equity trading at nikko securities 
international 
in bull markets there is plenty of that with abundant 
activity and many stories but bear markets see little activity and 
less information 
traders give up quickly on their positions that is why we see 
such sleepy trading rooms 
viewed from a historical perspective the numbers might not 
appear to warrant so much gloom although average volume on the 
nyse reached 18894 million shares in 1987 it averaged less than 
100 million shares a day as recently as 1984 ten years ago it was 
less than 30 million shares 
so a casual observer might regard the current slump as no more 
than a modest retrenchment after a long period of explosive growth 
in truth wall streeters like people in a good many other 
businesses are known for a tendency to hyperbole when they talk 
about their problems 
but analysts also point out that the recent slowdown is a very 
real threat to jobs and profits in an industry that had expanded 
its staff facilities plans and ambitions through the long 198287 
bull market 
according to the labor department employment in the securities 
industry grew from 243700 at the end of 1980 to 453500 seven 
years later 
when volume is down and expenses keep rising firms really get 
stung said devoe 
matthew drennan a new york university professor noted in a 
study released this past week that the new york securities industry 
had lost 8000 jobs since the crash and could lose 18000 more by 
the end of this year 
for the stock market and the investors who participate in it a 
decline in big board trading volume has traditionally meant trouble 
the last time it happened was 1977 when the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials fell 17 percent in a year generally characterized 
as mixed 
before that volume shrank in 1974 1973 1969 and 1962 all of 
which witnessed significant declines in stock prices 
the scariest periods for investors may be violent selloffs on 
huge volume like the one that occurred last october but as newton 
zinder a veteran analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc put it in 
a commentary this week light volume is not a positive sign when 
the market is in a declining phase

bond traders discovered the world wasnt flat 
last year 
among the 13 major international credit markets public debt 
climbed to 940 trillion in 1987 from 753 trillion in the 
previous year according to a report released this past week by 
salomon brothers inc 
that was an 113 percent gain as measured by constant exchange 
rates but in us dollar terms the increase was 25 percent 
reflecting the dollars depreciation the report said 
the need for credit throughout the world has grown by leaps and 
bounds in recent years as corporations expand economies change and 
trading becomes more globalized 
eight years ago the world bond market which includes 
government corporate and municipal issues totaled about 283 
trillion about a fifth of last years figure according to salomon 
the salomon report its seventh annual had few major changes 
from the previous year except that the market share of us 
dollardenominated bonds issued in 1987 continued to fall while the 
japanese market gained a bit more ground 
also primary market activity in the foreign and eurobond 
sectors slowed in 1987 most of the drop can be attributed to a 
steep falloff in us dollardenominated issuance reflecting 
diminished demand for us denominated assets the report said 
the drop in market share among us dollardenominated bonds and 
notes to 443 percent from 487 percent in 1986 was largely due 
to a 70 billion decline in the fiscal 1987 federal deficit the 
report said 
it said outstanding treasury issues increased by 12 percent 
compared to a 15 percent rise in 1986 the volume of government 
agency debt also climbed at a slower pace 23 percent vs 27 
percent in 1986 the gains in municipal and corporate issues 
though were up from the previous year according to the report 
despite the drop the us dollar bond market remained by far 
the largest major bond market in the world last year with public 
issues totaling 4165 trillion compared to 366 trillion in 1986 
the japanese yen bonds came in a distant second with public 
issues totaling 212 trillion for a 226 percent market share and 
west german deutschemark was third with 8115 billion issues and 
an 86 percent share salomon said 
the others were italian lira 5401 billion and 57 percent 
share french franc 3368 billion and 36 percent british 
sterling 3327 billion and 35 percent belgian franc 1968 
billion and 21 percent canadian dollar 1929 billion and 21 
percent swiss franc 1717 billion and 18 percent danish krone 
1712 billion and 18 percent swedish krona 1606 billion and 
17 percent dutch guilder 1284 billion and 14 percent and 
australian dollar 736 billion and 08 percent salomon said 
although many more countries issue bonds salomon doesnt 
include them in its count because their markets are less developed 
or less liquid

in the view of a good many wall street analysts 
rising interest rates and the depressed state of the securities 
markets are beginning to loom as a factor in this years election 
campaign 
pocketbook issues nearly always carry a lot of weight at the 
polls on the surface at least the picture looks pretty good for 
incumbents of both parties right now 
after all the unemployment rate is at a 14year low economic 
growth has been faster of late than almost anybody expected 
the recession that was so widely feared in the aftermath of the 
stock market crash last year has so far failed to materialize 
but interest rates have been moving up steadily in recent weeks 
the federal reserve most analysts agree has been taking measured 
steps to tighten credit in order to ward off a revival of inflation 
and some observers say the fed faces an especially delicate 
mission over the next few months 
in our opinion in order to deal with the present inflationary 
threat the fed must tighten more forcefully than it has to date 
said paul getman in a commentary for the wefa group a forecasting 
firm without such a move bond prices will continue to 
deteriorate 
getman said the fed is likely to pull in the reins a bit more in 
june and to raise its discount rate which now stands at 6 
percent during the summer 
if this tightening is sharp enough he added then the fed 
may not need to tighten again before the election 
but if the fed is not decisive enough in its actions then the 
bond markets will once again force the feds hand and it will not 
be pretty 
at the same time analysts say fed policymakers are well aware 
of the risks of being too aggressive the last halfpoint increase 
in the discount rate on sept 4 of last year may have played a 
part in or at least failed to prevent a crash in stock prices 
amid all these concerns stocks struggled to break a threeweek 
losing streak in the past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 385 to 195644 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 36 to 
14366 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 63 to 36666 and the american stock exchange market value 
index dropped 134 to 29050 
volume on the big board averaged 13575 million shares a day 
against 15680 million the week before 
optimists on the market outlook argue that the feds challenge 
will diminish as it becomes apparent that inflation worries are 
excessive 
over the last three years fears about impending acceleration 
of consumer prices have repeatedly swept through the bond market 
observed economists at shearson lehman hutton inc yet there is 
little evidence of any material acceleration of gains in consumer 
prices 
in the past few months the fear of depression has incredibly 
transformed itself into the fear of an economic boom said 
shearsons michael sherman neither expectation was or is based 
in reality 
in any case the feds success or failure in steering the 
economy through the election on solid ground may be determined in 
large measure by events beyond its control 
as eldon grimm an analyst at birr wilson amp co pointed out 
soybean prices have soared to fouryear highs due to tight 
supplies and threats of drought in some agricultural areas 
the federal reserve is powerless to make it rain in the 
soybean belt

positions in advance of the next meeting of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries scheduled for june 8 in vienna 
austria the opec ministers are expected to resume their ongoing 
debate over production and pricing at the meeting 
the market is taking a deep breath before it starts to trade 
headlines next week in preopec posturing said richard donovan 
head of the international energy group at shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
but donovan said he expected the 17 mark to provide a temporary 
floor for the nearterm crude contract 
id be surprised if a trapdoor opened on the downside before 
the opec meeting donovan said 
analysts attributed the uptick in the june contract for unleaded 
gasoline to technical factors as traders squared positions in 
advance of the expiration of the contract next tuesday

a steep drop in americans april disposable income and a 
slowdown in consumer spending have not eased investor fears of 
higher inflation or dissuaded economists from forecasting higher 
growth this year 
disposable personal incomes fell 09 percent last month the 
largest drop in a year and the first decline in that category since 
last november the commerce department reported friday 
economists attributed the decline to higher tax bills which 
also compelled many consumers to resist big purchases last month 
that left spending basically unchanged in april after a 08 percent 
rise in march 
before adjusting for taxes personal incomes edged up a tiny 01 
percent in april after a giant 11 percent rise in march 
the weak income growth and stagnant spending figures ordinarily 
would be regarded as signs of a slowing economy but economists 
said the april tax payments along with an early easter helped 
depress consumer spending one of the key engines of economic 
growth 
the report was largely ignored by the financial markets which 
have been preoccupied with anxiety over higher inflation and rising 
interest rates spawned by other signs of rapid economic growth 
there is a spreading belief that the federal reserve is 
tightening credit to slow the economy down 
stocks fell on wall street where the dow jones average of 30 
industrials dropped 1031 points to 195644 finishing the week 
with a net gain of 385 points volume was light 
in the bond market a key barometer of interestrate trends 
prices ended largely mixed after falling earlier in the day many 
traders quit early for the long memorial day weekend 
economists who had worried that the october stock crash foretold 
a recession have since expressed surprise at the countrys surging 
economic growth as signaled by low unemployment surging exports 
and strains on productive capacities 
the latest survey of the national association of business 
economists released friday showed a substantial upward revision in 
growth estimates for this year compared with a survey done three 
months ago 
the economists who advise some of the countrys largest 
corporations said they were looking for the gross national product 
to expand 29 percent this year which would match the performance 
turned in during 1986 and 1987 
on thursday the government to revise its own estimate of 
overall economic growth to 39 percent for the first three months 
of the year instead of 23 percent

texaco incs directors repudiated a 60ashare 
takeover offer from investor carl c icahn who responded by 
extending the deadline for acceptance and promising a full 
explanation of how he would finance the deal 
icahn texacos biggest shareholder with a 148 percent chunk 
also pressed ahead with a proxy fight for five seats on the oil 
giants board 
the developments on friday escalated a fight between the 
takeover strategist and the nations no 3 oil company which has 
been struggling to return to normal since emerging from bankruptcy 
a month ago 
in a brief statement a few hours before his 5 pm edt reply 
deadline the texaco directors as expected said no to icahns 
offer which values the company at 146 billion they called it a 
nonoffer pressure tactic and questioned whether he could 
arrange the financing 
icahn reacted by extended the offer until the companys annual 
meeting june 17 he said he would add a 60day extension after the 
meeting if his slate of board nominees wins 
it is a sad day when a board says its too late to give the 
owners of a company a chance to vote on a premium proposal to all 
stockholders he said in a statement 
the investor has been pressuring texacos management in recent 
months to boost the value of the companys stock if necessary by 
breaking it up and selling off the pieces 
icahn spokesman neil call said there were no plans to sweeten 
the offer and that leaves us with no alternative but to go 
forward with the proxy contest 
in a further effort to bolster his credibility icahn said 
details of how he planned to finance the offer would be presented 
at a security analysts meeting thursday in new york 
even before the board spurned him icahn was stoking the fires 
of his fight with the company late thursday he mailed ballots to 
shareholders urging them to elect his slate of candidates at 
texacos annual meeting 
texaco and icahn also expanded their war of words to fullpage 
ads in selected newspapers friday with texaco asking shareholders 
if they could trust the companys future to icahn and the takeover 
strategist urging them to take up his offer 
icahns side of the battle is expected to be an uphill one 
analysts have speculated that his offer was intended to flush 
out other bidders for texaco the consensus on wall street is that 
he is looking to boost texacos stock price rather than end up 
running a huge energy concern 
investors remained unenthusiastic about the offer friday texaco 
stock closed down 375 cents a share to 4962 in composite 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
although his 60 offer values texacos 243 million common shares 
at 146 billion icahn would not have to pay out that much if he 
decided to pursue such a bid 
he would have to pay 124 billion for the 207 million shares he 
does not already own and he paid about 12 billion for his 
existing stake of 36 million shares 
the combined total of 1364 billion would amount to the biggest 
sum ever paid in a corporate buyout the previous record was a 
134 billion acquisition of gulf corp by standard oil co of 
california now chevron corp in 1984
