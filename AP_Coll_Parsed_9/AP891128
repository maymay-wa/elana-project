sovietbloc forces likely would require so 
much preparation to attack western europe that us intelligence 
would detect the activity months in advance according to a report 
published wednesday 
a study prepared for defense secretary richard cheney said the 
intelligence community believes we would have some 33 to 44 days 
of warning time and possibly six months the washington post 
said in its wednesday editions 
the newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the report by 
unidentified officials the judgment on warning time was said to be 
shared by the joint chiefs of staff the cia and the defense 
intelligence agency 
nato war plans had been based on the assumption that the west 
would have just 10 to 14 days warning of an attack the newsaper 
said 
a short expected warning time led to decisions to invest large 
sums in airlift capability and forward storage of ammunition and 
supplies 
the study said that while it remained possible for the soviets 
to launch a quick attack that would allow the west less than two 
weeks warning such a move would be quite risky for the 
soviets 
the study also found that during the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
of czechoslovakia moscow was so worried about possible 
intervention from the west that it put its battlefield nuclear 
rockets on 10minute alert even though moscow clearly wanted to 
avoid a general war in europe

americans marveled at the towering statue of 
ramses ii in an exhibit of artifacts from the mighty pharaohs 
reign but now it appears the colossus is a retouched image of 
someone else 
new research indicates the statue was of a lesserknown pharaoh 
who ruled 600 years before ramses the great was born experts say 
it became ramses because he had his artisans retouch the face and 
inscribe his name 
they also say the ancients would have been worshipping both 
godkings when they made offerings to the 24foot statue of red 
granite which weighs 47 tons 
no one doubted the statue was of ramses when in 1987 it was 
pulled from its grave of mud and weeds in memphis the ancient 
egyptian capital 
so positive were promoters that it was given a royal sendoff 
from the mediterranean port of alexandria a band played the 
national anthem and boat sirens blared a 20minute farewell salute 
with american help the statue was restored at memphis state 
university in tennessee then it joined other ramses artifacts 
already being exhibited to complete a hugely successful nationwide 
tour of us museums 
first at memphis then in denver boston charlotte nc and 
dallas the colossus stole the show 
but it isnt ramses says art historian hourig sourouzian who 
has spent years studying ramses statues 
its sesostris i she said ramses touched it up made it 
more his style and put his name on it 
of course when ramses did this the statue became ramses no 
problem but when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus 
they were remembering not only ramses but sesostris 
sesostris i also was called the great and died in 1926 bc 
he was a pharaoh of the middle kingdom while ramses was of the new 
kingdom ruling for 67 years in the 13th century bc 
ms sourouzian said a major problem in identifying large 
egyptian statues is that ramses had so many of them and his name 
was so famous that any oversized statue naturally was assumed to 
have been his 
nevertheless she said something disturbed me even then 
when she first saw the colossus in the mud of egypt 
the next time i saw it was on exhibit in memphis tenn she 
said it was beautifully restored beautifully lighted but when 
i took a deep look i said its not ramses 
rita freed who led the restoration team for the institute of 
egyptian art and archaeology at memphis state said she first heard 
of the sourouzian research a year ago 
its excellent i think shes right ms freed said by 
telephone from the boston museum where she now works 
i didnt think anything about it until we brought the statue 
to tennessee she said once we had it standing i said gee 
that looks middle kingdom but i must emphasize its ramses his 
name is on it and weve done a wonderful job of saving a 
magnificent statue 
it is no secret that ramses had a fondness for gigantic statues 
of himself he erected them throughout egypt 
some depict him standing some sitting the largest estimated 
to have stood 57 feet and weighed 1000 tons lies headless in his 
ruined mortuary temple the ramesseum 
perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at abu 
simbel southern egypt 
ms sourouzian said she discovered ramses the great borrowed 
colossal statues in his customary grand style she reported finding 
nine sesostris i retreads 
both pharaohs had connections with memphis now mit rahina 
village 17 miles south of cairo memphis contained several 
colossi including one of ramses now in cairos ramses square 
another of him remains at mit rahina on display where it fell 
a twin of the colossus that toured america also a madeover 
sesostris is in pieces at the mit rahina outdoor museum ms 
sourouzian said 
discovering what is or is not the ramses look hasnt been easy 
for the armenianborn scholr who is a doctoral candidate at the 
sorbonne in paris and coauthor of the official catalogue of 
cairos egyptian museum 
relics of ramses and his family are everywhere in egypt he had 
at least three queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to 
have fathered 167 children 
about 300 statues of ramses have survived and ms sourouzian 
has used her artists eye to examine them clothing expression 
muscles size of the legs items in each hand the crown 
statues of sesostris era had one look those of ramses another 
in earlier times statues showed fierceness because the 
pharaohs were trying to show they could smite their enemies ms 
sourouzian said ramses who truly was great could have 
portrayed himself on statues this way but he preferred a faint 
smile a gentleness 
a ramses statue has a sweet expression he has massive legs 
and wears a longer kilt he has a triangular or round face with 
almost almondshaped eyes looking down he wears a uraeus on his 
crown an ornamental cobra favored by new kingdom pharaohs 
the nine colossi that ramses recycled are backed by stone slabs 
and have straight mouths rectangular faces thick cheeks and eyes 
staring straight ahead the kilts are short 
despite ms sourouzians research the identity of the colossus 
scheduled to arrive home from america on dec 6 is not in question 
said egyptian antiquities official zahi hawass 
when the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient 
memhis the name well put under it is ramses ii he said

the last words anyone heard the 
rev ignacio martinbaro say were what an injustice what 
carnage 
a few minutes later he and five jesuit colleagues were shot 
down the killers seemed determined to leave no witnesses the cook 
and her teenage daughter were slaughtered too 
but someone survived the bloodbath nov 16 at jose simeon canas 
central american university a cleaning woman named lucia barrera 
de cerna 
in sworn testimony the judge made available monday to the 
associated press mrs barrera 44 said the killers wore military 
uniforms 
until monday only sketchy secondhand accounts were available 
of her testimony about the killings that stunned el salvador and 
caused an international outcry 
i dont discount any possibility its probably members of the 
military said ricardo a zamorra the investigating judge who 
took her statement nov 22 at the spanish embassy where the woman 
hid until fleeing to miami last week under the protection of us 
officials 
mrs barrera said she was awakened by gunfire at about 1 am 
and ran to a window in moonlight that was like daytime she 
reported seeing five uniformed men close in shooting on the 
residence the six jesuits shared across the way 
two assailants wore camouflage she said like the uniforms i 
have seen on the soldiers in the street and the others were clad 
in dark uniforms 
she heard doors flung open and more shots then voices 
without being able to distinguish who spoke at first only the 
voice of padre nachito martinbaro was i finally able to hear he 
was saying what an injustice what carnage 
after an outburst of gunfire padre nachito spoke no more nor 
could i hear a single voice she said 
a few seconds later mrs barrera heard furniture crashing and 
glass breaking she said she left the window and rushed to tell her 
husband what she had seen crying for what i imagined might have 
happened because i couldnt hear the padre 
a few minutes later she heard an explosion then another 
after the explosions i heard no footsteps no sound 
nothing that told me where they had gone it seemed as though they 
had fallen from the sky 
when dawn came the terrified woman said she emerged and found 
the bodies of four priests including martinbaro vicerector of 
the university and the rev ignacio ellacuria the rector 
sprawled on the lawn with their faces destroyed the others were 
inside the residence which was ransacked and pocked by bullets 
the head of the society of jesus in central america the rev 
jose maria tojeida said later he could hear shooting for at least 
20 minutes 
reporters later said that hundreds of empty assaultrifle 
cartridges littered the area 
judge zamorra a close friend of one of the victims the rev 
segundo montes 56yearold head of the universitys human rights 
institute said circumstantial evidence also pointed to the 
military 
its logical because of the time he said 
zamorra said autopsies indicated the eight victims died at about 
2 am 
a dusktodawn curfew was imposed four days earlier and 
according to jesuit officials there was a virtual military cordon 
around the campus 
soldiers had searched the residence the day before the killings 
the jesuits had been the targets of threats bombs and public 
denunciations by rightists who considered their liberal theology 
akin to communism 
im confident well find the masterminds because the 
government has decided to pursue this to the end zamorra said 
the massacre prompted fears that rightwing death squads had 
been turned loose in el salvador as leftist rebels conducted their 
biggest offensive of the decadeold war and president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government is under intense pressure to 
resolve the case 
judge zamorra said he must sort through records of fingerprints 
ballistics evidence footprints and the results of a fivehour 
autopsy session that was repeated after sniper fire interrupted it 
were confident well find the fingerprints of the guilty 
he said we have faith that god will help us well follow it to 
the end 
the judge was educated by jesuits and teaches at the university

doctors implanted part of a womans liver in her 
21monthold daughter monday and predicted the nations first 
livingdonor liver transplant would be a success 
were quite confident that this organ will work said dr 
christoph broelsch who led the surgical team in the 14hour 
operation at university of chicago medical center 
teresa smith and her daughter alyssa were in critical 
condition in intensive care and doing well officials said alyssa 
came out of surgery about 910 pm about five hours after her 
mothers operation ended 
broelsch said doctors would get some indication over the next 24 
hours on how the liver is functioning 
in three to five days they will know if the surgical wounds are 
healing properly and in a week they should get an indication of 
whether the liver segment is being rejected by the body 
the liver was already starting to work producing bile as 
doctors were finishing the operation broelsch said 
shes in as good a shape as any child we see at this stage 
after a transplant he said 
the surgery is the first liver transplant from a living donor in 
this country doctors at the hospital said 
broelsch said the most difficult moment came when mrs smiths 
spleen was damaged during her surgery and doctors had to remove it 
we didnt expect that at all but we had it under control in 
two or three minutes broelsch said in no way at any point was 
the mothers life in danger 
the surgery was the first liver transplant from a living donor 
in this country according to doctors at the university hospital 
alyssa went through a critical period of about a halfhour 
without a liver very well before the segment was sutured into place 
shortly before 6 pm ernst said 
doctors then had to flush preserving fluid out of the organ 
segment they planned to make sure it was beginning to work 
properly before reconnecting blood vessels and bile ducts ernst 
said 
mrs smith was out of surgery at 4 pm more than seven hours 
after entering surgery she was listed in critical condition in an 
intensive care unit but is expected to be fine the spokesman said 
shes fine a little hurting she has some pain said her 
husband john l smith who visited her after the surgery 
people can live without their spleens although it may make them 
more susceptible to infection ernst said 
if successful the operation could provide a solution to a 
severe shortage of organs for children who need transplants said 
doctors at the hospital 
more than 700 babies a year in the united states need liver 
transplants and as many as half die for lack of a donor 
alyssa suffers from an oftenfatal liver disorder called biliary 
atresia the leading cause for liver transplants involving children 
she had been waiting more than a year for a cadaver liver 
transplant when the smiths heard about the hospitals plans for an 
experimental livingdonor program in august liver transplants from 
living donors have been performed only three times in brazil 
australia and japan one child has died 
mrs smith went into surgery at 735 am to begin the operation 
in which the left lobe of her liver about onethird of the organ 
would be transplanted in her daughter 
she was as eager to get started as she was a month ago when we 
first proposed this to her said hospital spokeswoman mary 
fetsch she has not displayed any signs of doubt or hesitation 
broelsch led the surgical team in the twophase operation about 
3 hours into the mothers operation doctors prepared alyssa for 
the transplant 
mondays surgery was complicated by the need to keep the removed 
portion of the liver intact he said but he noted the hospitals 
doctors had been transplanting portions of cadaver livers into 
children since 1984 with better than 80 percent success 
a medical ethicist said using a parent as donor raises some 
serious questions 
given the extraordinary pressure that any parent would feel 
to do anything possible to help the life of their child would 
the emotional attachment interfere with being able to fully 
understand the benefits and risks of the operation researcher 
reinhard priester said monday from the university of minnesotas 
center for biomedical ethics 
mrs smith had no doubts 
once youve given someone a big piece of your heart its easy 
to throw in a little bit of liver said the 29yearold 
schoolteacher from schertz texas before mondays surgery 
a medical ethics team worked closely with doctors in preparing 
the family for the operation ernst said 
in a way i kind of fear for her but im confident everything 
will turn out ok said john smith an assistant shipping 
supervisor who was at the hospital with the couples 3yearold 
son richard 
the chicago hospital has spent more than a year planning the 
program and last august authorized 20 such operations to determine 
whether the procedure is viable 
until now the only regularly performed livingdonor transplants 
have involved kidneys and some pancreas segments

the tennessee valley authority paid 172700 
to fly a manager between his tennessee office and his virginia home 
for a year because officials believed the man would otherwise quit 
a congressional report says 
the study released monday by the general accounting office a 
research agency of congress said the authority provided the 
flights for steven a white between oct 2 1987 and sept 30 
1988 while he was the tvas nuclear power manager 
white had been hired when the authoritys management was being 
criticized by congress the nuclear regulatory commission and 
others 
tvas board of directors believed that the special 
transportation services were necessary to retain mr whites 
management services the gao wrote 
white lived in charlottesville va and worked in the tva 
office in chattanooga tenn a distance of more than 400 miles he 
left the agency nov 18 1988 
white a retired admiral who served in the navys nuclear 
submarine program was hired as a consultant by the tva in january 
1986 when the authority was facing severe problems with its nuclear 
power program the previous fall the tva shut down its five 
operating reactors and halted construction on 12 others 
the flights were made primarily on friday evenings and monday 
mornings so white could spend weekends at home the report said 
we found no evidence that tva provided similar commuting 
services to its employees or to contractors the investigators 
wrote 
whites wife accompanied him on three of the flights using 
governmentpaid seats the report said 
tva spokesman william lee in knoxville tenn said he could not 
comment on the report because the authority had not seen it white 
did not return a telephone message left at his charlottesville home 
until october 1987 white flew to work on commercial airlines 
and was reimbursed by the tva the study did not say how much white 
billed the authority for the trips 
the report stated that from oct 2 1987 to march 18 1988 the 
tva provided air transportation for white through a contract with 
bechtel one of the authoritys construction subcontractors 
small numbers of other tva and bechtel workers also flew on some 
of these flights but the flights were geared to meet the needs 
of mr whites schedule the report said 
under their contract the tva paid for four of the eight seats 
on each flight white was a passenger on 34 of the 39 flights 
which ended when the tva decided the arrangement was not 
economical the service cost the tva 108400 the report said 
during the next six months the tva used its own aircraft or 
chartered planes for white during that period white made 23 
flights between his home and office at a cost to the tva of 64300

president bush will protest to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev during their weekend summit against 
the outrageous behavior of moscows central american allies 
but also will be prepared to discuss deeper troop cutbacks in 
europe officials say 
the subject of central america was assured a more prominent 
place in bushs talks with gorbachev on saturday and sunday after 
the discovery of a shipment of surfacetoair missiles reportedly 
sent by sovietbacked nicaragua to leftist guerrillas in el 
salvador 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler on monday called 
the arms shipment a dangerous escalation of conflict in el 
salvador 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush will 
press the soviets to take action to ensure that their allies cease 
this outrageous behavior 
bush and gorbachev will meet on warships in the mediterranean 
off the coast of malta primarily to talk about the rapid pace of 
change in eastern europe as hardline communist regimes are 
collapsing 
fitzwater said bush has been studying a wide range of military 
options involving troop levels in preparation for his meeting 
with gorbachev and in planning for a scaleddown defense budget he 
will submit to congress next year 
the president will have in his mind all of the options that 
are available to him fitzwater said the president wants to be 
in a position to discuss the situation with the soviet leader to 
be responsive and to be in a position to then go to our allies and 
say heres what our discussion produced here are his ideas here 
are my ideas now where do we think we might want to go 
after two days of talks with gorbachev bush will fly to 
brussels belgium to brief nato allies next monday 
in may the allies approved bushs proposal to reduce us and 
soviet troop levels in europe to 275000 on each side requiring a 
300000person cutback in soviet forces and a 30000 reduction in 
us troops 
fitzwater said bush and gorbachev would talk about arms control 
and military force structure those discussions will bear on 
future decisions about changes in our own military posture 
he said reductions in soviet forces beyond the level proposed by 
bush would enhance stability reduce the risk of war and be 
welcomed by the united states 
it is only logical that substantial further reductions in 
soviet forces would lead to changes in natos military posture 
fitzwater said however he said any changes would have to take 
place within the structure of the viennabased talks on reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
any actions that we would suggest or recommend would only be 
with the approval of our allies fitzwater said 
meanwhile the state department said the united states had 
lodged a formal protest with the soviet union at the embassy in 
washington over the missiles that turned up in el salvador 
there were 24 sa7 missiles and 21 rounds for a sovietdesigned 
mortar aboard a cessna aircraft that crashed in eastern el 
salvador the state department said 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze had promised 
secretary of state james a baker iii in september that the soviets 
had stopped direct weapons shipments to nicaragua baker said at 
the time he did not challenge that assertion 
but the state department has said since then that soviet bloc 
weaponry continues to pour into nicaragua some of it after 
shipment through cuba or nicaragua 
fitzwater said despite soviet promises to use their influence 
for peace in central america it is clear the sandinistas and their 
marxist allies continue to destabilize the legitimate democracies 
of the region 
privately us officials said monday the soviets may be having 
trouble restraining managua and havana from supporting the leftist 
rebels

say goodbye to solar max the satellite that 
got a heart transplant in space and lived for another five years 
studying the sun the 77 million space probe is dead and coming 
back to earth maybe in pieces 
we expect it to come down on dec 2 plus or minus 24 hours 
capt thomas niemann of the us space command in colorado said 
monday 
solar max has been getting scientific information from the sun 
for nearly 10 years covering almost one complete solar cycle but 
its fuel ran out and it is no longer possible to keep it out of the 
clutch of earths atmosphere 
it is clinically dead said randee exler of the goddard 
space flight center in maryland even its death taught engineers 
something they wanted to see if the solar panels would jettison on 
command after all this time in the chill of space they did 
the satellite is tumbling near the edge of the atmosphere which 
is becoming increasingly dense when the 5000pound spacecraft is 
finally captured and plunges through the atmosphere it will be 
mostly destroyed by fire but some larger pieces may survive and 
fall in chunks to earth 
the chance of any large piece falling on anyone is remote most 
of the satellites path is over water although it travels across 
south america africa india australia and the southernmost tip of 
china south florida and the extreme southern part of texas and 
hawaii are the only us areas along the track 
solar max was launched in february 1980 when three of its seven 
instruments failed experts thought enough of the satellite to send 
a space shuttle crew to repair it in 1984 they pulled next to 
solar max brought it into the cargo bay fixed it and sent it on 
its way the first time such a feat had been attempted in space 
a month later in may 1984 solar max recorded one of the 
largest flare eruptions ever seen on the sun 
other achievements in solar maxs career 
in 1987 its gamma ray spectrometer was the first instrument to 
detect rays from supernova 1987a a distant star that exploded in a 
neighboring galaxy the magellanic cloud 
it detected 10 comets colliding with the sun the latest on 
sept 28 
its ultraviolet spectrometer detected small increases in 
highaltitude ozone levels around earth just north of the equator 
and also decreases just south of the equator 
it recorded more than 12500 solar flares powerful eruptions 
on the sun and made it possible for scientists to measure sunspot 
magnetic fields above the visible surface of the sun for the first 
time 
nasa said it will miss solar max but that its sun science 
program will continue a solar observatory is scheduled for launch 
in 1995 an orbiting solar laboratory in 1996 and a us soft 
xray telescope will be on the japanese solara satellite scheduled 
for launch in 1991

lawmakers who say they uncovered fraud during 
an investigation of the firings of chicago air traffic controllers 
are criticizing the justice department for shifting the case to 
another agency 
it is your departments responsibility to investigate and 
prosecute perjury or obstruction of justice violations not the 
responsibility of the inspector general rep glenn m anderson 
dcalif said in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh 
anderson chairman of the house public works and transportation 
committee questioned the decision to buck the matter to the 
transportation departments inspector general 
in september the committees investigations panel released a 
report that said aviation officials lied and created evidence to 
support the firings of hundreds of chicago controllers during the 
1981 strike 
a government appeals board citing attendance records upheld 
the firings in 1985 
however the investigations subcommittee said faa officials had 
set up a war room at the chicago air route traffic control 
center in aurora ill and created records to replace original 
shoddy documents 
the committee feels very strongly that witnesses who give 
perjured testimony during a congressional investigative hearing 
should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law anderson 
told thornburgh it would be astonishing to learn that the 
justice department does not share this belief 
a justice department official said monday that the case was not 
closed 
they want more information to see which way to go said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity there are a lot of 
options 
during their probe lawmakers were not judging the merits of the 
nationwide strike which left about 450 chicago controllers out of 
work rather they said they were concerned with the actions of faa 
officials who were defending the firings before the merit systems

independent researchers should be given access 
to secret government files on worker exposure to radiation at 
federal nuclear weapons plants says an advisory panel to energy 
secretary james d watkins 
the recommendation if accepted by watkins would mean a 
historic shift in the governments stance on public access to 
medical and radiation exposure records dating to the start of 
american nuclear weapons production in the 1940s 
the advisory panel of nine health and legal experts said in an 
interim report to watkins late last week that dropping the energy 
departments longstanding ban on public access to the data would 
help restore the departments sagging credibility 
watkins on monday welcomed the report but did not say whether he 
would accept the recommendation which was among several aimed at 
improving the departments health research activities 
this is a highly qualified group of professionals watkins 
said in a prepared statement their ideas are very much in line 
with my own impressions of what we need to do to strengthen this 
important research activity 
watkins statement said he instructed the departments acting 
energy research chief james decker to prepare a plan by dec 15 
for making those changes that can be implemented on the basis 
of the advisory groups recommendations 
watkins assembled the group in august to advise him on ways to 
restructure the departments health research program some members 
of congress are pressing for legislation to move the research 
responsibility to another government agency such as the department 
of health and human services 
the department for years has fought a pennsylvania group the 
three mile island public health fund over access to the medical 
records which are the most detailed collection of data on health 
effects of longterm exposure to radiation 
daniel berger an attorney for the pennsylvania group said 
monday were cautiously optimistic that watkins will heed the 
advisory panels recommendation which was based on more than two 
months of study of the departments health research programs 
it could be a major milestone in our quest for the data 
berger said in a telephone interview 
the information includes death records and the historical 
exposure to radiation of about 300000 people who have worked at 
the governments nuclear weapons plants and laboratories in 12 
states over the past four decades 
government researchers under contract to the energy department 
have published numerous studies based on the disputed data but 
independent researchers without access to the material have been 
unable to form their own interpretations 
the advisory groups report said watkins should adopt a policy 
of maximum possible openness with regard to the release of data to 
the three mile island fund research workers 
the group said only two limitations should be placed on access 
to the data by independent researchers none of the workers 
identities should be disclosed and the department should be 
allowed to withhold files being analyzed for studies planned for 
publication until they actually are published 
the advisory group also recommended watkins begin immediately to 
secure agreements with states to provide for the release of death 
certificates so that information derived from the certificates can 
be made available to independent researchers 
the group said it had come to no conclusion on whether the 
departments epidemiological research activities should be 
transferred to another government agency 
the advisory panel is due to submit a final report to watkins 
next year

the navy frigate named after vietnam war hero 
lt cmdr wilmer paul cook performed a solemn mission scattering 
its namesakes ashes at sea 22 years after the combat pilot died in 
battle 
the uss cook left port monday morning and paused off the coast 
for the 20minute service before resuming maneuvers said navy 
spokesman cmdr david dillon 
it was believed to be the first time a navy ship was involved in 
the sea burial of its namesake dillon said 
cook a highly decorated a4 skyhawk pilot was shot down three 
days before christmas 1967 while leading an air strike over north 
vietnam he was listed as missing for more than 20 years before his 
remains were returned to the united states last year and later 
identified 
its nice that he came home finally its nice that hes back 
in the united states thats all i care about really said his 
eldest son wilmer paul cook jr it eased my mind to know where 
he is exactly for years i didnt know whether he was alive or 
dead 
cook 31 and his younger brother john cook 26 and their 
uncle john m cook jr 65 of titusville nj attended a 
portside memorial service aboard the frigate on friday 
the family requested his remains be scattered at sea from the 
ship that bears his name 
i wanted him to be remembered by the ship and the people who 
make it go the elder son said 
its a rare occasion for a ship and its crew to be able to 
honor the man for whom the ship is named and to commend the 
remains to the deep the frigates cmdr richard kalb said at 
fridays memorial 
hospital corpsman 1st class james gorham who attended mondays 
service on behalf of the family before returning to san diego by 
helicopter said the ship was brought to a stop and the crew of 250 
mustered to pay their final respects 
navy chaplain james sharrett led a prayer and read from the 
bible as the ships executive officer lt cmdr steven bostwick 
scattered the ashes into the pacific 
a sevenmember honor guard fired three volleys into a clear sky 
to salute the dead pilot and taps was played to conclude the 
service 
the uss cook was commissioned in 1971 in new orleans it was 
named after cook who was 35 when he died because of his valor 
dillon said 
navy frigates like this are traditionally named after military 
heroes he said 
cook a native of annapolis md and a 1956 naval academy 
graduate became an aviator in 1957 his carrierbased squadron was 
sent to vietnam in 1965 
he flew more than 300 missions in his skyhawk named the city 
of annapolis during two tours to the tonkin gulf on the carriers 
constellation and coral sea 
among his commendations were three distiguished flying crosses 
and five air medals for aerial combat he was considered an expert 
in the skyhawk and had been urged to return stateside to train 
others but felt he was needed more on the frontline 
on the day he was shot down the navy said he had turned down 
shore duty to lead the fateful air strike 
ill always go where my country sends me and will always do 
whatever it asks cook once wrote in a letter to his parents 
perhaps what i am doing may keep my two sons from going to war

the head of the usbacked afghan resistance 
says he wants america to supply highaltitude antiaircraft weapons 
for use against soviet bombers he says are flying against his 
forces from soviet territory 
sibghatullah mojaddedi who met with president bush at the white 
house on monday also said he hopes bush will tell soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev at their summit next weekend to drop his 
support for the puppet regime and the communist government in 
the afghan capital of kabul 
unfortunately the free world thinks that the russians have 
withdrawn completely from afghanistan mojaddedi told the 
associated press in an interview after his meeting with bush 
still the russians are bombing our people the mujahedeen 
guerrillas from their own territory he said speaking very 
formal but very clear english 
i told president bush that we must be strong in the military 
field or no political solution will come said mojaddedi who is 
the president of the afghan interim government the government was 
formed in exile in peshawar pakistan as the soviets withdrew the 
last of their 115000 troops from afghanistan last february 
bush and mojaddedi did not talk about the summit the afghan 
leader said adding it is up to him whether he discusses it with 
gorbachev or not i think that president bush probably will speak 
to gorbachev about the afghanistan issue because it is a very 
important international matter 
the afghan leader said that during the white house meeting bush 
promised us his support and assistance 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
that bush reaffirmed our support for the afghan resistances 
efforts to achieve selfdetermination and also expressed us 
interest in a political settlement 
he said bush called upon the afghan interim government to 
continue and increase its efforts to fashion a stable broadly 
based government responsive to the needs of the afghan people 
mojaddedi said deliveries of us weapons to the mujahedeen 
guerrillas of afghanistan resumed two months ago after a break of 
eight months 
there was a gap we do not know what the reason was we 
suffered from that we hope that it will not happen next time he 
said 
two months ago deliveries resumed the commanders of the 
mujahedeen have been more effective these two months they have 
achieved great progress in many areas and have captured a number 
of strategic posts and many weapons and even tanks from the 
enemy said mojaddedi 
the biggest need of the mujahedeen now is weapons to use 
against the air force which bombs from a very high altitude he 
said 
up till now we have not asked for highaltitude 
antiaircraft weapons he said before his delegation leaves on 
friday he said we want to ask we are asking for all kinds 
of weapons 
despite the red army withdrawal the soviets have greatly 
increased their military aid to kabul sending between 300 million 
and 400 million a month in arms according to us intelligence 
estimates 
secretary of state james a baker iii at his meeting in 
september with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
complained of the high level of soviet military aid 
but the soviets responded that the united states by sending the 
guerrillas a reported 500 million in arms annually via pakistan 
was violating the geneva accord that secured the red army 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
if the soviets are as charged by mojaddedi flying bombing 
missions against the anticommunist mujahedeen guerrillas it also 
would appear to violate the geneva accords 
mojaddedis accusation was echoed in a letter to bush from 17 
congressmen released monday 
shortages of weapons have emboldened the soviets we have also 
received what we believe to be reliable accounts of soviet planes 
coming across the border to attack the resistance at the very 
least these reports need to be carefully and thoroughly 
investigated said the letter circulated by reps robert 
lagomarsino rcal and don ritter rpa

space shuttle discovery 
streaked out of orbit and landed safely monday in the setting sun 
at this mojave desert air base ending a secret military mission 
extended an extra day and then an extra orbit by high winds 
air force col frederick gregory commander of the fiveperson 
crew guided the winged spaceplane to a touchdown on a concrete 
runway at 430 pm pst after a fiveday flight that covered nearly 
2 million miles 
with the sun glinting off the underside of the vehicle it was 
really a pretty landing said nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato 
the orbiter touched down to the strains of the national anthem 
wafting from loudspeakers across the desert to an applauding crowd 
of about two dozen nasa observers 
immediately after the touchdown nasa workers began preparing 
for the crew to exit from discovery darkness fell quickly leaving 
the orbiter illuminated by powerful searchlights on the desert 
runway 
an hour after touchdown the crew was driven away in a van to 
undergo medical exams then three hours later reappeared to address 
about 60 friends and nasa workers gathered on a cold airplane ramp 
outside a hangar 
gregory did not explain why he came out wearing a salmoncolored 
slipper on his right foot and a brown shoe on the left 
one of the things that you learn when you go in space is that 
you dont have to wear the same kind of shoes when you come out 
he said 
lovato said she did not know why he wore a slipper 
speaking of a few things that had not worked right the 
commander recalled that on his first shuttle mission the toilet 
aboard the shuttle challenger had broken 
and lo and behold the first thing that broke on discovery 
this time was the bathroom but we fixed it very quickly he said 
he did not specify what else hadnt worked 
the extra day in space was spent relaxing and taking 
pictures he said 
the crew then took off around 9 pm pst in nasa jets for the 
johnson space center in houston 
two sonic booms cracked overhead as discovery descended through 
a clear sky and made its sweeping approach to runway 04 fortyfive 
minutes before touchdown controllers directed gregory to shift to 
runway 04 from the hard clay of runway 17 because of more favorable 
winds 
the rays of the setting sun shone brilliantly off the shuttle as 
it made its final approach to a centerline touchdown 
the shuttle landed in light crosswinds of 4 mph and a headwind 
of about 19 mph ending the 5day 6minute and 46second mission 
in the pink streaks of a setting sun 
mission control lifted its curtain of silence on the flight to 
report 80 minutes before landing that gregory had successfully 
fired two braking rockets to drop the shuttle out of orbit and 
start it on a fiery plunge through the atmosphere 
the propulsion officer and the crew confirm that the burn was 
good control center commentator billie deason reported after the 
3minute 4second rocket ignition 
the fiveday flight reportedly put in orbit a satellite to 
monitor military communications over a wide area of the globe 
although as many as half a million people have flocked to this 
desert air base to watch previous shuttles land mondays touchdown 
was closed to the public because the mission was classified 
winds gusting to 30 mph forced nasa to call off a landing 
attempt here on sunday the winds were not as strong monday but 
were high enough at times at more than 15 mph to make conditions 
unacceptable for a planned landing at 252 pm 
with prospects looking better for the followon orbit 
controllers directed the astronauts to stay aloft another 89 
minutes as predicted the winds subsided and nasa gave the 
astronauts the goahead to fire the braking rockets 
the delay sunday shifted the touchdown from nighttime to 
daylight during which landing rules are less stringent a shuttle 
is not allowed to land at night if crosswinds exceed 12 mph the 
figure rises to 17 mph in daytime 
it was the sixth time in 32 shuttle missions that a return to 
earth has been postponed by bad weather 
the delay posed no threat to the astronauts because they had 
enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit until wednesday if 
necessary nasa also has other landing sites at white sands nm 
and at cape canaveral but prefers the long wideopen runways at 
edwards 
discoverys other crew members are pilot john blaha and mission 
specialists manley carter jr story musgrave and kathryn thornton 
in announcing the landing delay mission control said that the 
shuttle and its crew continued to be in excellent condition a 
pentagonimposed news blackout that affected most of the mission 
kept the space agency from discussing the astronauts reaction to 
the delay 
however sources close to the project have said the astronauts 
achieved their main goal thursday the second day of the flight 
when they released a 2ton 300 million satellite designed to 
listen in on military and diplomatic communications in the soviet 
union europe africa and the middle east 
the crew also reportedly conducted experiments related to the 
star wars missile defense system it was believed the 
astronauts also performed research into how people can serve as 
military observers in space 
as discovery was ending its thanksgiving mission sister ship 
columbia was being readied at cape canaveral for a 10day christmas 
mission during which five astronauts are to deploy a navy 
communications satellite and retrieve a scientific satellite that 
has been orbiting the earth for nearly six years 
columbia was scheduled to be transported to a launch pad tuesday

agriculture spending is being reduced by more 
than 1 billion during this fiscal year under an agreement reached 
by congress to help lower the federal deficit 
after weeks of negotiations the house and senate agreed to the 
savings last week just before recessing for the year the fiscal 
year began oct 1 
the cuts are part of the massive bill known as budget 
reconciliation that includes 147 billion in savings from all 
departments of the federal government 
the agriculture measures included in the reconciliation 
conference report were the ones that we feel will achieve the 
required savings in a fair and equitable manner with minimal 
disruption of farm program objectives said rep kika de la 
garza dtexas chairman of the house agriculture committee 
a 235 million savings comes from reducing deficiency payments 
for 1990 crops by 
233 cents per bushel for wheat 
233 cents per bushel for corn 
0515 cents per pound for upland cotton 
515 cents per hundredweight for rice 
another 54 million is expected to be saved through repayment of 
advance deficiency payments for 1988 crops of wheat feed grain 
upland cotton and rice 
however those repayments would not be required before dec 31 
if the producer suffered 1988 or 1989 crop losses because of a 
natural disaster or before july 31 1990 for the portion of the 
crop covered by the 1988 disaster assistance act 
about 116 million will be saved from the soybean sunflower and 
safflower planting program and the feed grain limitations program 
that section requires the agriculture secretary to offer farmers 
the chance to plant soybeans sunflowers or safflowers during 1990 
similar to the provisions of the 1988 disaster aid act 
other savings include 
143 million through reduction of export enhancement program 
and targeted export assistance payments 
500 million through purchases of financial assistance corp 
stock by farm credit system institutions 
27 million through adjustments in dairy price support 
programs including setting the purchase price for price support 
purposes for butter at no more than 110 per pound it also makes 
the 50 cents per hundredweight decrease in milk price supports 
discretionary for 1990 
25 million by altering the way the agriculture secretary 
allocated butter and nonfat dry milk powder purchases between 
april 1 and july 1 1989

sen pete wilson rcalif wants us 
chemical companies to stop selling foreign countries pesticides 
that are banned in the united states 
in addition to protecting public health the export of 
dangerous pesticides creates a competitive inequity between foreign 
and american farmers and growers wilson said at a news 
conference monday 
he said us growers were required to use what often are more 
expensive pesticides to meet federal regulations against dangerous 
chemicals while foreign growers can use the less expensive 
products that have been banned in the united states 
wilson who is running for governor of california introduced 
federal legislation late last week that would stop us companies 
from exporting pesticides banned here 
a spokeswoman from the western growers association in irvine 
calif said competition from foreign growers is a big problem for 
california farmers and will be a key issue in the gubernatorial 
campaign 
weve been letting sen wilson know that we are under extreme 
pressure from foreign farmers said barbara buck adding that 
california farmers are experiencing everincreasing costs of doing 
business 
meanwhile farmers in other countries are able to pay far less 
in wages have cheaper land get chemicals very cheaply and can use 
whatever they want in most cases buck said 
in the frozen side of the business there have been a lot of 
broccoli asparagus and cauliflower growers who have gone out of 
business because they cant compete with the frozen vegetable 
production in mexico 
in 1988 the value of all fresh produce imported to the united 
states had risen to 602 million from 379 million in 1980 buck 
said adding that the number of separate food products grew from 27 
in 1980 to 40 in 1988

the agriculture departments new yearbook is 
designed to help farmers be better managers 
the 336page book farm management how to achieve your 
business goals offers practical information from university and 
extension experts says editor deborah takiff smith 
more than 80 authors contributed to this years edition 
focusing on individual farmers making decisions on the use of land 
labor capital and managerial skills a different topic is selected 
each year 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter a nebraska farmer said 
management is one of the reasons us agriculture is so competitive 
on the international market 
only talented managers can succeed in todays tough business 
environment where our farmers must face not only the competition 
of their neighbors but often that of the government treasuries of 
other nations yeutter said in the foreward of the book released 
monday 
the usda yearbook officially began in 1894 although annual 
volumes of reports were issued in the 1840s when federal 
agriculture was under the commissioner of patents 
annual reports were continued after the usda was created in 
1862 according to agency historical accounts copies of the 
reports were distributed by congress a tradition that continues 
today 
smith said 211800 copies of the 1989 yearbook are being 
provided to congress with each senator getting about 350 books and 
each member of the house about 400 
constituents may obtain free copies of the yearbook from 
senators and members of congress she said the books may be 
ordered for 10 from superintendent of documents washington dc 
20402 the yearbooks also will be sold at government bookstores in 
many cities

federal health officials are conducting a 
criminal investigation into alleged scams involving rigging of 
cholesterol screening devices to produce higher than normal 
results officials said 
the intent is to make referrals to physicians for followup 
testing said richard kusserow inspector general of the department 
of health and human services and rep ron wyden dore 
wyden chairman of the house small business subcommittee on 
regulations and business opportunities said monday that his panel 
had uncovered evidence that mass cholesterol testing has been 
used by unscrupulous entrepreneurs to capture patients with rigged 
negative results 
the results he said then are used to sell customers 
additional unneeded and expensive medical tests and services 
wyden declined to discuss the investigation further calling it 
a sensitive legal matter 
kusserow in an interview after testifying before wydens 
subcommittee said his office was investigating several scams 
that involved referral of medicare and medicaid recipients for 
unnecessary tests 
it is illegal to bill those federal programs for services that 
are not needed he said 
we have very few isolated cases of that but they are 
instances where these people have crossed the line he said 
during the hearing kusserow and wyden both expressed concern 
that increasing public interest in cholesterol testing has created 
a new moneymaking opportunity for entrepreneurs who care more 
about profits than public safety 
screenings are popping up regularly in shopping malls store 
fronts pharmacies health clubs and other public settings 
kusserow estimated that at least 10 million people had their blood 
cholesterol tested this way in 1988 
often the screenings are used by private companies and 
entrepreneurs as a marketing strategy for products that claim to 
reduce cholesterol and by stores to increase traffic and sales 
kusserow said 
the inspector general said a study conducted by his office at 
wydens request found extensive problems with quality control and 
proper hygiene at these screenings 
among the problems he said were testers who were not properly 
trained to operate cholesterolmeasuring devices or to draw blood 
in a way that assures a true reading testers also often failed to 
wear gloves and those who did often did not change them 
such disregard for proper hygiene poses the risk of infection 
both for testers and those being tested from bloodborne diseases 
including aids and hepatitis kusserow said

and allegations of wrongdoing related to the department of housing 
and urban development 
the committee said monday that it had hired former federal 
prosecutor henry schuelke to replace robert bennett 
bennett who will continue to handle two other cases for the 
committee told the panel last week that his law firms diverse 
practice could lead to an appearance of conflict of interest in the 
damato case details of how such an appearance could arise were 
not given 
mark green damatos 1986 election opponent filed a complaint 
with the committee accusing him of breaking senate rules in the 
reaganera problems at hud damato has denied any improprieties 
schuelke will help the committee determine whether to proceed 
with a formal investigation 
bennett is still the committees outside counsel conducting a 
similar review in a case involving five senators who interceded 
with banking regulators on behalf of a contributor whose savings 
and loan was collapsing 
bennett also is the committees counsel in an investigation of a 
book deal by sen david durenberger rminn

for east germanys jews the democratic 
change battering the communist government stirs new hopes and old 
fears 
i feel fearful when people get up and say hang the 
communists because when it starts with the communists it always 
ends with the jews said economist and writer irene runge a 
prominent member of east germanys tiny jewish community 
when newspapers say disaster threatens because poles and other 
foreigners are smuggling this to me has the sound of the nazis 
the crumbling of the berlin wall however has raised hopes that 
the east german government will finally pay reparations to jewish 
victims of the nazi holocaust and to israel and hand over billions 
of dollars worth of jewishowned buildings in east berlin seized by 
the nazis 
east germanys decision nov 9 to let its 165 million citizens 
travel freely also means that the isolated east german jews 400 
officially registered and some 4000 others can have regular 
contact with the approximately 37500 jews in west germany and west 
berlin 
before world war ii the german jewish population totalled 
560000 
east and west german jews will celebrate the festival of 
hanukkah jointly next month for the first time since the wall went 
up in 1961 
and years of tortuous negotiations with the government for 
concessions such as allowing a young jew to visit israel or attend 
a west german jewish student conference are no longer necessary 
earlier this month the president of the east german jewish 
community dr peter kirchner wrote to the new east german 
premier hans modrow urging the establishment of diplomatic 
relations with israel 
he also wants a pledge to suppress any neofascist party that 
might arise and to include in the school curriculum special courses 
on the holocaust and judaism 
there is no doubt that many things will ease kirchner a 
55yearold neurologist said in his office near the blackened hulk 
of east berlins oranienburger strasse synagogue 
but he often sounded hesistant during an interview 
he avoided direct criticism of the 40 years of communist rule 
and stressed that the government pays special pensions to all 
victims of the nazis including jews 
he pointed out that the government pledged last year after 
seven years of stalling to pay half of the 50million mark cost of 
restoring the oranienburger strasse synagogue it was partially 
burned by the nazis and then bombed in the allied blitz of berlin 
in 1943 
his eyes glistened with tears when he spoke of his fears that 
east germans new political freedoms might unleash a neofascist 
revival 
unlike many of east germanys poorly paid stateemployed 
doctors kirchner has no desire to move west 
i could not imagine charging a patient he said the 
medical system here has a lot of weaknesses but everybody is 
equal i am used to a set income from the state 
kirchner earns about 2000 marks a month which is worth 1100 
at the official rate but onetenth of that or less on the open 
market 
he paused and added if neofascism were to arise here i 
would not know where to go now israel i am too old to learn the 
language 
kirchner was nine when he was rounded up for deportation to 
auschwitz 
by chance several hundred of the 10000 jews seized that day 
were let go including kirchner and his mother seventeen fellow 
factory workers of his nonjewish father hid the mother and child 
on the outskirts of berlin until the war ended 
east germanys handful of jewish survivors and the communists 
installed in power in the post1945 division of europe shared a 
history of persecution under hitlers third reich 
and antifascism was a consistent theme in the propaganda of the 
government 
now to some east german jews looking over the berlin wall the 
most striking features are not glittering stores but rallies by the 
small extreme rightwing republican party which calls on younger 
germans to reject guilt feelings about the nazi past 
relations have not always been easy with other jews in the west 
a germanspeaking american rabbi appointed to the east berlin 
community in 1987 left after less than a year complaining he felt 
repressed including by the jewish leaders a replacement has not 
yet been found 
some east german jews are themselves communists 
americanborn mrs runge 47 was brought to berlin after world 
war ii as german jews her parents fled the nazis in the 1930s as 
communists they fled america to return she said to help build a 
new socialist germany 
unlike west germany which has paid more than 43 billion in 
reparations to jewish victims of nazism and to israel the east 
germany government maintained it would not pay because it was not 
the successor to the third reich 
in recent years the authorities signalled a change held 
meetings with the members of the world jewish congress and the 
conference on jewish material claims against germany there was 
talk of a 200million payment but nothing yet has happened 
the question of reparations is important mrs runge said 
but what i most want to see now is germans here acknowledging 
responsibility for the nazi period

nina rubinstein was just weeks away from her 
doctorate when the nazis occupied her university in 1933 
her thesis was on her desk at johann wolfgang goethe university 
in frankfurt her formal education was over she would flee to 
paris later to new york 
next week miss rubinstein 81 will present her thesis to 
professors at the west german university 
if all goes as planned shell get the degree 
better late than never said david kettler a professor at 
trent university in ontario and one of those who initiated the 
effort to have her work recognized 
miss rubinsteins supporters say recognition of her work is a 
victory for academic freedom in a land where nazis expelled jewish 
and leftist professors and students among those who remained 
kettler said the lack of civil courage was a disaster 
for miss rubinstein a retired united nations interpreter it 
means she has to reread the 247page manuscript that sat on a shelf 
in her manhattan apartment for 40 years 
i had forgotten most of it she said monday im still not 
finished 
shell participate in a colloquium on the thesis which 
ironically concerns political emigration after the french 
revolution 
the thesis almost didnt make it out of frankfurt after the 
nazis occupied the building 
we were standing there pretty helpless she recalled it 
occurred to me that there was one student who was a nazi i 
wouldnt have talked to him normally i asked him to get my 
thesis he got it and i disappeared 
she went to paris where she stayed until 1940 when hitlers 
armies approached again she fled this time leaving everything 
behind including the thesis 
a french neighbor kept miss rubinsteins belongings and after 
the war traced her to new york the manuscript sat on a shelf for 
decades becoming not very important in my life until her 
halfsister hanna papanek tried unsuccessfully to get it 
published in the 1970s 
claudia honegger a professor at goethe persuaded the 
university to recognize the work kettler said 
this is important because i think the university is making a 
public statement a practical statement that it recognizes a wrong 
was done kettler said not to a big shot but to an ordinary 
person and they are making good on it not out of pity but on the 
merits of the case 
the awarding of the degree coincides with the 75th anniversary 
celebration for the universitys social science institute where 
miss rubinstein was a 25yearold student in 1933 
the institutes dean lothar brock said the event has a 
special meaning to both nina rubinstein and the university it is a 
good occasion not just to talk about these people but to have them 
here 
kettler said that while german universities were not responsible 
for naziera atrocities they were responsible for the way they 
dealt as institutions with the people who were victimized by their 
complicity during the nazi period there were very very serious 
sins of omission 
ms papanek said many of the other people who were expelled 
or had to flee have died its a lucky thing that nina is alive and 
can accept this as recognition of work she did in her youth 
miss rubinsteins professor was the noted sociologist karl 
mannheim who accepted her thesis but was suspended from the 
university along with other jewish and leftwing faculty he fled 
germany 
my professor wrote me a letter saying since you completed 
your thesis theres no reason not to get in touch with another 
professor and pass your exam miss rubinstein said he was 
naive 
she was concerned about the interruption but i must say that 
with all the political events dominating you didnt have too much 
time to think about that 
as a child miss rubinstein and her mother moved from germany to 
denmark at the outbreak of world war i then from the soviet union 
to germany when the bolsheviks took over in 1918 her topic grew 
out of the experience of russian emigres and is relevant today 
she said 
in our time the problem of emigration is quite important 
said rubinstein who is fluent in english german russian and 
french 
its very much a current topic said her halfsister what 
nina looks at is the experience of being a stranger it really 
became a forecast of things to come when she worked on it she had 
no way of knowing that

against vehement us objections arab 
nations plan to push a resolution through the general assembly this 
week that would recognize the palestine liberation organization as 
a nation 
the state department immediately threatened to cut off all us 
support for the united nations if the general assembly approves the 
move washington is assessed 216 million annually onefourth of 
the un budget 
we feel so strongly about this we would cut off funds state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said monday 
riyad mansour the plos deputy permanent observer said the 
resolution would be introduced in connection with the general 
assemblys debate on palestine which opens wednesday 
the political significance is that the general assembly 
accepts the state of palestine as part of the un system at this 
stage as an observer mansour said 
the plo has observer status as an organization at the united 
nations the only other observer group is the southwest africa 
peoples organization swapo which this month won 
preindependence elections in namibia where it had fought south 
african rule 
if the arab resolution is apparoved the plo will gain national 
observer status the would put it on a par with north and south 
korea monaco the vatican san marino and switzerland which lack 
voting rights and can only address the assembly by invitation 
the resolution should easily gain the required simple majority 
of votes in the 159member general assembly most members of the 
nonaligned movement with more than 100 votes and communist 
nations would vote in favor 
in rome arab states are calling on the unaffiliated food and 
agriculture organization fao to cooperate with the plo in 
distributing food to palestinians that brought a us threat to 
cut funds to the fao 
a vote on that issue proposal could be held by wednesday 
ms tutwiler said we strongly support humanitarian assistance 
to the palestinian people and noted the us contribution this 
year is 63 million the plo should not be a conduit for 
international assistance to the palestinians she said 
ms tutwiler said the united states was making it clear in notes 
to various governments and to officials at the united nations that 
any action to change the plo status will have the most serious 
adverse consequences 
mansour said resorting to blackmail in conducting 
international diplomacy is not useful to anyone 
congress recently passed a foreign appropriations bill that 
requires the bush administration to cut funds for any organization 
that moves to recognize the plo 
last year the plo declared the existence of a state of 
palestine in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
mansour said 117 nations have recognized palestine the 
united states most european countaries and some latin american 
nations have refused saying the proclaimed state lacks the basic 
attributes of a nation 
arab members in the faos governing general conference have 
introduced a resolution calling on the agency to provide the 
palestinian people with the assistance necessary for their economic 
development in close cooperation with the palestine liberation 
organization 
it asks the fao to include the israelioccupied territories in 
future programs and activities in line with present cooperation 
and coordination between the palestine liberation organization and 
other united nations agencies 
us officials said the action politicizes the fao which has as 
its mandate promoting agriculture and food supplies in the third 
world 
earlier this year the united states blocked plo attempts to be 
recognized as a nation in the world health organization and the 
un educational scientific and cultural organization

erich honecker the communist who ruled east 
germany for nearly two decades until his ouster last month is a 
broken man whose only solace is visiting with his grandson his 
bodyguard says 
whats he got to live for honecker is so sick that he cannot 
show himself in public the aide gen guenter wolf told western 
reporters outside honeckers home in the former party elites 
exclusive wandlitz compound 
he is a broken man for him the world has fallen apart wolf 
told the reporters who were allowed to visit the wooded residential 
compound just north of east berlin for the first time monday 
the 77yearold hardline leader was ousted oct 18 following an 
exodus of east germans to the west and huge demonstrations for 
democratic reform 
he was replaced by his protege egon krenz who promptly 
promised reform and has tried to distance himself from his 
hardline mentor 
a party commission is conducting an investigation of honecker 
that could result in his ouster from the party a special 
parliamentary commission is also investigating charges of abuse of 
power by his 18year administration 
meanwhile honecker sits inside the twostory brown house 
waiting for a visit from his grandson wolf said 
reporters caught a glimpse of honecker on the upper floor of the 
house apparently talking to a visitor and looking through some 
papers at a table no contact was possible 
a young woman with a child in her arms could be seen in the 
background when she saw reporters outside she pulled the shades 
down 
honeckers daughter from berlin takes care of him and his 
young grandson is everything to him wolf said he said honecker 
received hardly any visits except from his family but offered no 
further details about them 
the house has no nameplate only the number 11 on the short 
sandstone wall around the building it is one of 23 houses in the 
compound once the secret pride of the countrys communist elite 
wolf assured reporters that honeckers house contained no 
italian marble no silk wallpaper and no sauna it looked modest 
by western standards but more than any ordinary east german could 
hope for in a lifetime 
a beige east germanmade wartburg was parked outside the house 
wolf said it belonged to honeckers wife margot who lost her post 
as education minister shortly after her husbands ouster 
a week ago krenz understanding the resentment struggling east 
germans felt toward leaders who lived in luxury moved to a modest 
house in east berlin and said other leading party officials would 
follow 
wolf said honecker and his wife want to move from wandlitz 
before the end of the year 
several other ousted politburo members also still live in 
wandlitz including former economic adviser guenter mittag and 
former propaganda chief kurt hager 
wandlitz residents have been told to stop using frenchmade 
citroens and to use east german wartburgs or sovietmade ladas when 
going to east berlin 
kiwis and pineapples have been removed from the exclusive shop 
in the compound and replaced by products that can be found in 
ordinary stores 
a sales clerk jutta wittig said honeckers preferred wine was 
a dry white muellerthurgau from miessen she said the honeckers 
always ate healthy food with lots of curds 
she said honecker had good taste always ordering dark blue 
suits with white shirts 
krenzs new leadership has blamed honecker and mittag for 
plunging the country into the crisis and mittag has been kicked out 
of the party krenz however has said that honecker is too ill to 
be interrogated by the party commission 
honecker underwent two gallbladder operations this summer and 
his wife has also told east german media that he still has not 
recovered fully

two peewee football teams set out last week for 
florida to play in their leagues sunshine bowl countless delays 
a stolen bus and two decisive losses later the players dream trip 
had become a nightmare 
the experience was like something you read in a horror book 
said a parent chaperone russ hayes who broke into tears it was 
very traumatic 
there was one consolation 
well we got to disney world hayes 12yearold son 
michael said of the thanksgiving trip the worst part was we 
didnt get much sleep 
on monday a day later than their scheduled return 12 of the 
116 players coaches and chaperones returned to chicago others 
were expected to straggle in by bus 
its been one terrible experience after another michaels 
mother jacqueline said as she waited at ohare international 
airport its been a terrible nightmare for all of them 
were totally exhausted weve had a very very trying five 
days coach rino liberatore said after stepping off the plane 
we lost the football game we lost the bus we lost our money 
but hopefully we didnt lose our spirit 
the 1100mile bus trip to florida got off to a bad start 
wednesday night when one of the three rented buses arrived three 
hours late 
things went downhill from there 
once the teams got on the road two of the buses broke down 
filling with exhaust and causing many in the group to fall ill 
delays for repairs made the players arrive 13 hours late in 
orlando fla 
the 9 to 14yearold members of the two chicago teams had to 
cut short a visit to walt disney world and rest up for the next 
days games against two florida teams 
then while they were playing one of the buses was stolen 
along with at least 3000 in cash donated to help pay for the trip 
and many wallets belonging to the travelers 
to make matters worse the teams lost their games 220 and 
486 
i wasnt into the game a lot said michael hayes a running 
back from burlington wis i was still thinking about the trip 
the players from the pop warner league earned the money for 
their trip after winning the bowl invitation in local play 
the teams financed the trip by selling candy and collecting 
contributions local corporations including the chicago bears 
matched the sum collected by the youngsters 
team officials blamed the problems on falcon motorcoach co 
complaining that the chicago company rented them buses that were 
old and poorly serviced 
weve been put in a situation that i dont think anybody 
should have to when theyre traveling on the road like that with a 
group of kids said liberatore adding that he hopes to get a 
refund from the bus company 
kenneth arnold coowner of falcon said two of the three buses 
had been leased from another company he declined to name the 
company or say why falcon leased from it adding a breakdown can 
happen at any time and anywhere 
michael hayes said he was glad to be home despite all the 
problems he said hed go on such a trip again under the right 
conditions 
if i ever go again he said id have someone look over 
the bus first before we leave

a fundamentalist hindu party has 
catapulted into a key powerbroking position after national 
elections and its leader pledges to end the rule of prime minister 
rajiv gandhi 
i will see to it that the prime minister falls said lal 
krishna advani head of the bharatiya janata party as dozens of 
supporters flocked to his new delhi home draping him with garlands 
of marigolds 
the party registered huge gains in the elections for 
parliaments powerful lower house winning at least 73 seats in 
the last election it won two 
analysts have linked its rise to a revival of hindu 
fundmentalism epitomized by plans to build a new hindu temple on 
the site of a 16th century mosque 
the temple plans which were supported by the party sparked 
riots this fall between hindus and moslems in which at least 300 
people were killed 
advani said he opposes violence but added that the government 
must stop its reverse discrimination against hindus who make 
up 82 percent of indias 880 million people 
as congratulatory phone calls came in and party activists 
munched cakes and sweets monday the party chief said he was ready 
to unite with other opposition groups to end a corrupt dynasty 
the reference was to the gandhinehru clan that has occupied the 
prime ministers office for all but five years since india won 
indepenence in 1947 
gandhis grandfather jawaharlal nehru was indias first prime 
minister the job later passed to his daughter indira gandhi 
mother of the present prime minister 
incomplete election results showed that gandhis congress party 
would not win a majority in the 543seat lok sabha or house of the 
people the lower house of parliament that chooses the prime 
minister 
but the main opposition group the national front was running 
behind congress 
the scene was thus set for advanis party to play the crucial 
powerbroking role 
of all the main parties advanis is the most conservative it 
favors development of indias nuclear forces and strict policing of 
border areas with pakistan and bangladesh 
it also pushes hindu rights advocating the abolition of a 
commission set up to protect minorities in addition it encourages 
privatization a large percentage of indias industry is staterun 
advani 62 won a parliament seat in new delhi party colleagues 
posted victories throughout the plains of northern india 
some political commentators are concerned that the rise of his 
party symbolizes a growing split in the indian political scene 
but others welcome the inclusion of such elements in parliament 
because they say it forces them to compromise and thereby 
modifies their fundamentalism 
but at advanis house monday there was little talk of 
compromise 
we are very powerful now the party boss said the people 
have spoken

mortars exploded and gunfire 
resounded in northern san salvador today awakening capital 
residents to renewed fighting between government forces and leftist 
rebels 
it was the first time this week that the fighting appeared to be 
anything but brief exchanges between the two sides 
about 10 flares were dropped by circling helicopters over the 
northern neighborhoods of mejicanos and ciudad delgado and more 
than two dozen mortar rounds shattered the predawn silence 
because of a dusktodawn curfew the extent of the combat was 
not immediately clear assaultrifle and occasional machinegun 
fire was heard but those exchanges were not heavy or sustained 
on nov 11 guerrillas of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front launched their biggest offensive of the decadeold 
civil war more than 1000 people died in 12 days of combat in san 
salvador and several provincial cities 
the rebels have said that fighting which turned the capital 
into a battleground was the first phase of a broader operation 
the rightist government of president alfredo cristiani contends 
it defeated the insurgent push but cristiani also said last week 
they the guerrillas are doing some things that look more like 
regrouping than retreating 
despite 35 billion in us aid salvadoran government forces 
have been unable to defeat the rebels the war has claimed the 
lives of at least 71000 people mostly civilians 
thousands of civilians who lost their lives in the conflict were 
slain by rightwing death squads early in the decade 
this fall attacks on leftist civilian leaders resumed and on 
nov 16 six jesuit priests were murdered along with their cook and 
her teenage daughter 
the military was widely blamed for the massacre and a cleaning 
woman lucia barrera de cerna has sworn she saw the the killers 
wearing uniforms 
cristiani has promised a full investigation 
government and military officials have accused clergy and church 
workers of sympathizing with and even supporting the rebels 
on sunday an american church worker jennifer jean casolo was 
arrested after authorities raided her home and said they found 
explosives and 80000 rounds of ammunition for assault rifles 
ms casolo 28 of thomaston conn was still in the custody of 
the national police on monday said jeff brown a us embassy 
spokesman in el salvador 
he said she was being questioned and had not been charged as of 
late monday she works for the christian educational seminar based 
in san antonio 
under the stateofsiege imposed after the rebels launched their 
offensive nov 11 authorities have up to 15 days to file charges 
or release someone instead of the normal 72 hours 
white house officials say the evidence against ms casolo is 
strong but friends and associates say she was framed as part of 
the governments campaign to discredit church workers

virginias closest and most prolonged 
election for governor next goes before a threejudge panel that 
will supervise a recount requested by the republican who lost to 
democrat l douglas wilder 
j marshall coleman a former attorney general said monday he 
wants a recount and an investigation of alleged irregularities in 
the nov 7 balloting 
the state board of elections said that wilder beat coleman by 
6854 votes or 38 percent out of nearly 18 million votes cast 
unofficial returns had showed a 6852vote lead for wilder the 
states lieutenant governor who will be the nations first elected 
black governor 
coleman is entitled to a taxpayerfunded recount if the margin 
is less than half a percent election results have been overturned 
in at least one recount of a local race in virginia but this will 
be the first statewide recount 
coleman said he would contest the election to the general 
assembly unless the recount and other information convinces him 
that the proceeding is no longer necessary to safeguard the 
accuracy and integrity of the election 
in a notice to general assembly leaders coleman said voter 
registration lists used in the election contained the names of 
people ineligible to vote 
in an election as close as this one irregularities which 
would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a 
greater importance coleman said in an accompanying letter 
a panel of three judges will rule on the recount which will 
involve a check of each paper ballot and election machine 
seventyfive of the states 1967 precincts still use paper ballots 
that are kept under seal in local clerks offices said susan 
fitzhugh secretary of the state board of elections 
the judges the chief judge of the richmond circuit court and 
two others appointed by the virginia supreme court will hold a 
hearing to decide how to conduct the recount 
she could not predict how long it would take but said we 
usually have finished all our recounts prior to christmas 
if coleman contests the election the matter would first come 
before the privileges and elections committees of the house and 
senate said state sen stanley c walker the democratic president 
pro tempore of the senate 
walker who won a contested election for his senate seat in 
1979 said the proceeding would resemble a trial with lawyers for 
both candidates presenting witnesses and evidence to the 
legislators

a computerenhanced xray technique could help 
doctors diagnose alzheimers disease and paranoid schizophrenia by 
allowing them in effect to look not just at the brain but at the 
mind radiologists say 
the technique called spect may turn out to be the single 
most important imaging method we have to diagnose alzheimers 
dr frederick j bonte said monday at the 75th general assembly of 
the radiological society of north america 
traditional imaging methods such as computed tomography and 
magnetic resonance havent been able to contribute much to the 
diagnosis of alzheimers except to rule out other conditions that 
may cause alzheimerslike symptoms he said 
but spect actually gives images of the physiological processes 
in the brain rather than merely the organs structure said bonte 
director of the nuclear medicine research center at the university 
of texas southwestern medical center in dallas 
using spect he and his coworkers accurately have identified 
about 150 of 170 dementia patients as victims of alzheimers an 
incurable disease of aging that afflicts up to four million 
americans 
alzheimers causes memory lapses confusion loss of ability to 
function and eventually death and often goes undiagnosed for two 
or three years because people wrongly attribute early symptoms to 
normal effects of aging 
though no treatment exists for the disease spect could be 
valuable in separating treatable types of dementia that resemble 
alzheimers from actual alzheimers bonte said also when 
researchers do devise treatments spect could be used to monitor 
their effectiveness he said 
in spect an acronym for single photon emission computed 
tomography patients are injected with a radiopharmaceutical a 
chemical compound that emits a small amount of radiation 
the chemical travels to the brain where it settles into the 
tissues in direct proportion to the amount of blood flow in that 
area of the brain bonte said 
alzheimers is characterized by abnormalites in brain blood 
flow he said early in the disease brain cells begin to die 
and this reduces the flow of blood in that portion of the brain 
these areas show up very well with spect 
spect scanning could become generally available within a year or 
two he said it takes less than four minutes to perform and costs 
about 450 compared with 800 for a cat scan and 1000 for mri 
bonte said 
the technique uses a machine that would be affordable to most 
community hospitals and could be used for constructing images of 
organs besides the brain he said 
dr theodore r simon deputy chief of nuclear medicine at the 
clinical center of the national institutes of health in bethesda 
md reported that spect also has proven useful in diagnosing or 
confirming diagnoses of paranoid schizophrenia and other 
psychiatric disorders such as depression 
until now psychiatric diseases have been diagnosed 
subjectively primarily through clinical observation of behavior 
simon said spect provides an objective technique to view the 
physical evidence of schizophrenia in the brain and confirm the 
clinical diagnosis 
schizophrenia afflicts an estimated two to five of every 1000 
americans causing symptoms that may include impairment in 
thinking delusions hallucinations changes in emotions and 
changes in behavior according to the national alliance for the 
mentally ill 
paranoid schizophrenia is a subtype of the disease characterized 
by feelings of persecution or less commonly grandiosity 
according to the arlington vabased organization

abu nidal among the most feared 
palestinian terrorist leaders is hospitalized in the libyan 
capital of tripoli with what algerian sources described today as 
terminal cancer 
one algerian medical source who recently returned from libya 
denied a published report that abu nidal has been placed under 
house arrest by libyan police in response to pressure from egypt 
and the plo 
in reality abu nidal is in a military hospital in libya 
suffering from a cancerous metastasis which is probably terminal 
the algerian physician said he insisted that his name be withheld 
metastasis is the spread of disease from one part of the body to 
another 
other algerian sources recalled that abu nidal 52 was treated 
in bulgaria for cancerous complications several years ago 
the sources attributed the report in todays new york times 
that he had been arrested by the libyan authorities to officials in 
cairo or tripoli seeking to conceal the severity of his illness 
the algerian doctor said he was summoned to tripoli a week ago 
for consultations with a libyan colleague he denied having seen 
abu nidal himself 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna is wanted for 
terrorist acts in countries throughout the world he has lived in 
libya since his 1987 expulsion from syria 
he allegedly played a leading role in crimes including the 
bloody attack on the israeli delegation at the 1972 olympic games 
in munich and the 1985 hijacking of an egyptian airliner in which 
56 passengers were killed in malta during a rescue attempt 
he is also blamed for the coordinated attacks on airline 
passengers in rome and vienna in december 1985 
in all nearly 1000 people have been killed or wounded in 20 
countries due to activites by abu nidals 15yearold group the 
fatah revolutionary council 
the group has been at odds with the plo for many years many of 
its major leaders have defected to the main body of the plo 
recently leaving abu nidal increasingly isolated 
in october 1973 a war tribunal of the palestine liberation 
organization sentenced its former representative in baghdad abu 
nidal to death for armed sedition murder of plo members 
violating the laws of the revoultion and provoking conflicts 
within the organization 
the sentence was never carried out 
the times quoted unnamed arab diplomats and plo officials in 
paris as saying abu nidal had in recent days been confined to a 
compound near tripoli because of pressure from egypt and the plo 
in october president hosni mubarak of egypt asked libyan leader 
col moammar gadhafi to extradite abu nidal to egypt or stop his 
organizations terrorist acts from libya the paper quoted plo 
officials in tunisia and arab diplomats in paris as saying 
the request was a condition for restored relations between libya 
and egypt the times said it said there was no indication gadhafi 
intended to turn abu nidal over to egypt

people who have chunks of the berlin wall 
may be carrying more than a piece of history they may be carrying 
asbestos a state health official says 
when a german student at the university of oklahoma returned 
from a holiday trip to his homeland with two small pieces of the 
wall his host family saw what they believed was asbestos on one of 
the chunks 
they took it to the department where tests showed about 75 
percent of it was filled with chrysotileasbestos said john feero 
laboratory supervisor of the departments asbestos program 
chrysotileasbestos was commonly used in building materials 
feero said 
whether the entire berlin wall contains the cancercausing 
substance is unknown the asbestos material could be isolated to 
just the piece examined by state officials feero said 
he said the risk of harm is slight but any piece of the wall 
with asbestos should be kept in a sealed container 
the danger is minuscule but its still not something that 
should be transported all over the place without proper 
precautions feero said you probably wouldnt want it sitting 
in the open 
in the piece examined by state officials the asbestos fibers 
were imbedded in the matrix he said only by chipping crushing or 
breaking it would those fibers be released into the air feero said

the government today fired christian 
leader michel aoun as army commander but thousands of his 
supporters formed a human shield around the presidential palace to 
defend him from a feared syrian attack 
gen aoun who commands 20000 mainly christian troops pledged 
monday to die fighting rather than surrender to president elias 
hrawis government or the 40000 troops that syria has in lebanon 
aoun rejected parliaments election of hrawi last week and refused 
his earlier order to step down 
defense minister albert mansour told reporters in 
syrianoccupied eastern lebanon that adm emile lahoud former navy 
commander was now armed forces chief mansour warned that officers 
and men who stayed loyal to aoun would be dismissed 
it was not immediately known how many of aouns troops will 
remain loyal to him as lebanon was poised on the brink of another 
round of fighting 
the government move came three days after hrawi elected 
president by parliament friday dismissed aoun as head of an 
interim military government 
near the presidential palace in the beirut suburb of baalbek 
youths started hundreds of small fires that could be observed 
glowing in the pine woods from several parts of lebanon 
they are telling whoever wants to attack the general that 
civilians have to be killed first said a police spokesman who 
cannot be named in line with regulations 
aoun had predicted syria which backs hrawi might try to kill 
him in an air raid fears of renewed fighting also sparked panic 
buying in beirut as residents rushed to stock underground shelters 
witnesses said church bells tolled all night in the christian 
enclave north of beirut as youths headed to baabda to declare 
support for aoun hundreds more joined the crowd throughout the day 
many of us slept in cars in the palaces yard said michel 
hayek a university student 
we were singing the national anthem all night the general is 
the symbol of our independence if the syrians want to kill him 
theyll have to kill us first hayek said 
aoun has termed hrawis election unconstitutional and aides said 
he was determined to remain entrenched in the bunker of the 
presidential palace he had no immediate comment today to the 
government action 
president amin gemayel named aoun as head of an interim military 
government in september 1988 when gemayels sixyear term ended 
with parliament unable to elect a successor moslems and syrians 
rejected aouns government 
on nov 5 parliament elected rene mouawad as president of a 
national unity government but he was assassinated 17 days later 
hrawi was elected friday to replace him 
hrawi a maronite like aoun also said he was determined to rule 
from baabda traditional seat of lebanons presidents even if it 
is one room 
in damascus the albaath newspaper mouthpiece of the ruling 
baath party called aoun an obstacle to lebanese unity that must 
be terminated 
aoun told a news conference at the palace bunker monday that 
hrawi has no forces of his own to fight me with he will have to 
rely on syrias occupation forces 
aoun noted that the syrians have the means to attack me from 
the air they might use that means i might be killed in such an 
air attack 
police said thousands of people have fled beirut to safer areas 
in south lebanon the eastern bekaa valley and the northeastern 
mountains in case hostilities erupt again 
however police and moslem army officers reported no troop 
movements 
by police count 930 people were killed and 2744 wounded in six 
months of clashes pitting aouns mainly christian troops against 
syrian and allied forces before an arab mediation committee 
succeeded in enforcing a ceasefire sept 22 
parliament last month forged a new powersharing formula between 
christians and moslems that hrawi has pledged to implement 
but aoun rejected the accord because it did not specify when 
syrias 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate would withdraw

the communist premier met with 
opposition leaders today and promised to push for a coalition 
government and elimination of the communists 40year monopoly on 
power a federal minister said 
ladislav adamec met for two hours with members of the civic 
forum group who were fortified by a nationwide demonstration 
monday against authoritarian rule that saw millions of people pack 
city centers 
today after 11 straight days of huge prodemocracy rallies 
cities were quiet as civic forum said it was time to take the fight 
off the streets and to the negotiating table 
marian calfa a federal government minister who was at the 
meeting told reporters adamec agreed to ask president gustav husak 
to appoint a new government that will include nonparty 
representatives representatives of other political parties and 
communists 
calfa said the new cabinet would be made up largely of experts 
and professionals and did not say if opposition leaders would 
have a place in it 
he also said the federal government would propose to parliament 
constitutional changes that would eliminate provisions guaranteeing 
the communist party a leading role 
requirements that education must be on marxistleninist lines 
also must be dropped calfa said and the government will ask that 
provisions binding allied political parties to the communists be 
dropped from the constitution 
until now these parties have been docile allies of the 
communists in recent weeks however they have played a much more 
independent role with the socialist party playing the most 
prominent part 
prague city authorities will be instructed to provide civic 
forum which has been operating out of makeshift headquarters in 
striking theaters and art galleries around the capital with 
premises for their activities calfa said 
some results have been achieved said civic forum delegate 
jan carnogursky as he left the meeting but he refused to give 
details 
before the talks began civic forum spokesman vaclav klaus said 
the opposition intended to offer adamec the choice of creating a 
coalition government or facing opposition calls for his resignation 
such calls already have led to the ouster of communist party 
chief milos jakes and several on the ruling politburo who had 
resisted the east bloc reforms introduced by soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
in further signs the communist party is moving to accommodate 
opposition demands jakes today resigned from his position as head 
of the national defense council and the head of the federal 
parliament alois indra also stepped down 
jakes and indra were among the hardliners who lost their 
politburo seats in a leadership shakeup friday 
mondays twohour nationwide general strike a festive affair 
of speeches song and flagwaving was the largest public display 
of opposition to the ruling communists since they took power in 
1948 
opposition leaders held out the threat of further strikes if the 
popular will was not heeded any doubt that workers backed the 
prodemocracy movement was erased on monday as shop floors across 
the country were idled 
civic forum said the strike committees that put together 
mondays wellorchestrated protest would be left on permanent alert 
if the need arose to organize another strike 
speaking at a rally in prague on monday night civic forum 
spokesman vaclav klaus called off further rallies and strikes 
pending the outcome of todays meeting 
on monday huge crowds of workers gathered in bratislava the 
east slovak industrial center of kosice the mining center of 
ostrava on the polish border and in usti nad labem the heart of 
industrial north bohemia 
crowds chanted dubcek to the castle referring to alexander 
dubcek the ousted leader of the failed prague spring reforms that 
were crushed in august 1968 by soviet tanks 
dubcek has returned from political obscurity to address crowds 
for four days running in prague and his native bratislava 
jakes and others dropped from the politburo were associated with 
the repression that followed the sovietled invasion he was 
replaced by karel urbanek who was shown on state television 
meeting with a group of workers 
battling to regain control as the remnants of power slip from 
their grasp communist authorities announced new concessions 
monday 
deputy premier jaromir zak said a new draft of the 
constitution would delete the article that declares the communist 
party the countrys leading political force 
the partys policymaking central committee approved an 
inquiry by a parliamentary commission into the brutal crackdown on 
a nov 17 rally in which riot police clubbed hundreds of peaceful 
demonstrators 
the czech and slovak ministries of culture said they had 
partially lifted censorship 
vladimir janku head of the states church affairs office was 
quoted by the official ctk news agency as promising an end to the 
states tight control of churches and saying the state would no 
longer issue licenses for priests 
also monday five old guard members of the slovak communist 
partys politburo were ousted and replaced by largely unknown

discoverys astronauts returned 
home under cover of darkness today after ending their secret 
mission with a sunset landing at a desert air base where gusts 
twice delayed the return to earth 
a news blackout imposed by the military prevented the astronauts 
from talking about what they did during their fiveday mission but 
commander frederick gregory did comment on one problem a 
malfunctioning toilet 
the crew performed i think flawlessly discoverys toilet 
didnt work but we fixed it said gregory who was wearing a 
slipper on one foot and shoe on the other he suffered a foot 
infection while in orbit nasa said 
meanwhile shuttle columbia was moved to a launch pad at cape 
canaveral fla today for a 10day christmastime flight during 
which it will put one satellite in orbit and retrieve another that 
is falling to earth 
after staying in space an extra day and then an extra orbit 
because of high winds discovery landed at 430 pm pst monday at 
edwards air force base calif 
with the sun glinting off the underside of the vehicle it was 
really a pretty landing nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato said 
the astronauts who reportedly released a spy satellite arrived 
at their home base here today before dawn a fitting finale to 
their hushhush flight despite showers about 30 people greeted 
the astronauts at ellington field 
gregory the first black to command a shuttle flight called the 
mission a success 
we did what we were supposed to do and we did it right and we 
even got a day yesterday to relax and take thousands of pictures 
literally he said 
we had a near perfect vehicle added mission specialist 
story musgrave 
the other crew members were pilot john blaha and mission 
specialists manley carter jr and kathryn thornton 
discovery originally was scheduled to land sunday but had to 
wait a day because of high winds that sent dust devils whipping 
across edwards 
mission control rescheduled the return for monday afternoon but 
winds forced another delay the winds were not as strong as the 30 
mph gusts reported sunday but were high enough to make conditions 
unacceptable for the planned 252 pm pst landing 
since conditions looked better for landing late in the 
afternoon controllers directed the astronauts to stay aloft 
another 89 minutes for one more spin around the globe as 
predicted the winds subsided and nasa gave the goahead to begin 
the fiery dash through the astmosphere 
fortyfive minutes before landing mission control directed 
gregory an air force colonel to shift to the concrete runway from 
a hard clay runway because of more favorable winds the shuttle 
landed in light crosswinds of 4 mph and a headwind of about 19 mph 
about four hours after touchdown the crew addressed about 60 
friends and nasa workers at edwards before boarding jets for 
houston gregory did not explain why he came out wearing a 
salmoncolored slipper on his right foot and a brown shoe on the 
left 
one of the things that you learn when you go in space is that 
you dont have to wear the same kind of shoes when you come out 
he said 
johnson space center spokesman kyle herring said gregory got a 
foot infection while in orbit but it had no effect on the mission 
herring said the infection was being evaluated and he did not have 
any other details 
the astronauts have today off but they will report back to work 
wednesday at the johnson space center to begin briefings about 
their flight 
sources close to the project have said the astronauts achieved 
their main goal thursday a day after liftoff when they released a 
2ton 300 million satellite designed to eavesdrop on 
communications in the soviet union europe africa and the middle 
east 
the crew also reportedly conducted experiments related to the 
star wars missile defense system

a centrist opposition alliance today won 
pledges of support from the right and left and said it was ready to 
oust prime minister rajiv gandhi and form indias first minority 
government since independence 
gandhis congress party in turn said it was willing to step 
aside and become the opposition 
we have not got a majority that is the verdict of the 
people party spokesman anand sharma said 
gandhis party won more parliament seats than the national front 
in elections that ended sunday but neither group has enough for a 
majority 
the mandate in this election is unmistakably a mandate for a 
change of government the national front said in a statement read 
by its spokesman dinesh goswamy as the leaders of the fiveparty 
alliance met 
the people of india want a noncongress government to replace 
the corrupt and inefficient congress government it is therefore 
the sacred duty of the national front to respect this mandate and 
to express its readiness to form a government the statement said 
the national front said a meeting will be held wednesday to 
select the fiveparty alliances candidate for the next prime 
minister of india the worlds most populous democracy 
the fronts strategy was to opt for a minority government with 
the tacit support of an array of parties ranging from communists to 
hindu nationalists 
the fronts leader former gandhi ally vishwanath pratap singh 
met with leaders of the communist partymarxist who said they 
would support the national front as long as it did not create a 
formal coalition with the hindu rightwing bharatiya janata party 
smaller communist and leftist groups also offered support with 
the same conditions indian news agencies said the bharatiya 
janata said monday it would support the national front without 
entering into a binding coalition 
the elections for parliaments policymaking lower house began 
wednesday and ended sunday 
with 451 of the 525 contested seats declared the congress party 
and its smallparty allies had 197 seats staterun television 
reported 
the national front had 102 seats the television said citing 
tallies from the election commission the bharatiya janata had 77 
the assorted communist and leftist parties had 44 seats and 
smaller parties and independents won the rest 
the seats for which results have not been announced are in areas 
where the national front is expected to do well 
in forming a government the front could be hardpressed to 
preserve an ideologically diverse governing coalition 
gandhi a caretaker prime minister since parliament dissolved 
monday night apparently hoped that deep divisions will cripple the 
effort and he appeared ready to sit tight and await such a 
conclusion 
the congress party has governed india for all but 29 months 
since independence from british rule in 1947 
gandhi was swept into office in december 1984 with an 
unprecedented 415 of the 543 seats in the lower house on a wave of 
sympathy generated by the assassination two months earlier of his 
mother prime minister indira gandhi 
but rajiv gandhis support waned after allegations of corruption 
were made against his government mostly over newspaper reports 
that the swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors paid kickbacks to win 
a 14 billion government contract in 1986 
while parliament has 543 elected seats only 525 were filled in 
this months elections balloting for other seats has been 
postponed indefinitely because of incomplete voter lists and 
candidates deaths

continue to urge a halt of the weapons testing program in french 
polynesia he dismissed french arguments that the program was 
needed to maintain a deterrent force and guarantee its national 
security

industrial research which monitors seismic activity said it was 
frances biggest blast this year and second only to a 115kiloton 
explosion on july 25 1979

hospitalized for a drug overdose 
psychiatrist alyce gullattee who directs the hospitals 
institute of drug abuse and addiction was interviewed twice by 
police investigators in june 1984 the station said 
when mayor marion barry was hospitalized his illness was 
the result of an overdose of drugs cocaine that occurred while he 
was in the company of a female companion who also overdosed 
gullattee told police according to the report 
barry overdosed a second time however he was taken to the 
district of columbia general hospital for treatment she was 
quoted as saying 
the station did not say how gullattee would know about treatment 
for a drug overdose at another hospital 
barry was taken to howard university hospital by ambulance sept 
23 1983 complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath after 
a party with friends at a washington hotel 
initially doctors feared the mayor had suffered a heart attack 
but a mayoral spokesman later told reporters that barry had been 
hospitalized for a hiatal hernia an abnormality of the digestive 
tract where part of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm 
wusatv did not say whether gullattee was involved in the 
mayors treatment gullattee declined repeated attempts monday for 
an interview 
the mayor has acknowledged being hospitalized at dc general

have been brought against him

hospitalized two more times for drugs once at a washington 
hospital on an undisclosed date and in january 1987 while he was in

allegations an outrageous character assassination and said his 
medical records reveal he did not overdose on drugs 
dr vincent roux the mayors personal physician said gullattee 
did not treat barry and has no knowledge of his condition roux 
said he had no way of knowing whether the mayor overdosed on 
cocaine

the us trade deficit edged up 200 million 
to 2775 billion from july through october after declining in the 
two previous quarters the government reported today 
the commerce department said the deficit showed a 07 percent 
increase from the apriljune quarter when the gap totaled 2755 
billion 
the net increase resulted from a 02 percent advance in exports 
which climbed to record 9157 billion and a 03 percent increase 
in imports which rose to a record 11932 billion 
both exports and imports were at record levels for the fifth 
consecutive quarter 
the secondquarter deficit the difference between imports and 
exports had been the lowest since a 257 billion imbalance in the 
first quarter of 1985 
for the first nine months of the year the deficit was running 
at an annual rate of 1116 billion down 123 percent from the 
1272 billion trade gap registered in all of 1988 
the imbalance narrowed 114 percent to 2838 billion in the 
first quarter and declined a further 29 percent to 2755 billion 
in the second 
the report was a bit higher than expected because earlier 
monthly commerce reports on merchandise trade indicated a small 
improvement 
some analysts and bush administration officials have questioned 
whether the deficit can continue to improve substantially in the 
months ahead 
some say that exports which have been propped up by prosperous 
overseas economies will continue to be hampered by the relatively 
high value of the dollar at the same time imports continue to be 
relatively strong 
a stronger dollar makes american goods more expensive and thus 
less competitive on overseas markets while making imported goods 
cheaper and thus more attractive to american consumers 
treasury undersecretary david mulford also said after commerce 
reported the september deficit improvement that further shrinkage 
could stall by next year unless the united states and its major 
trading partners do a better job of coordinating their economic 
policies 
the administration has based its predictions of healthy economic 
growth partly on the belief that exports would keep expanding 
todays report on merchandise trade which is calculated on a 
balance of payment basis is slightly different from the 
improvement already noted in the commerce departments monthly 
merchandise trade reports 
todays report excludes us military sales to foreign 
governments and makes other minor adjustments in the monthly 
figures 
in the third quarter nonfarm exports increased 12 billion 
or 2 percent to a record 818 billion the sector was boosted by 
shipments of capital goods including aircraft and parts to western 
europe japan and newly industrialized countries in the far east 
shipments of nonfarm products such as industrial supplies and 
materials and automotive parts fell farm products also fell down 
10 percent to 98 billion 
consumer goods including clothing and household goods led the 
increase in imports imports of industrial suplies and materials 
fell while both capital goods and automotive products were 
virtually unchanged 
oil imports decreased 1 percent to 133 billion due to lower 
prices the average prices per barrel fell to 1685 from 1846 
during the quarter while the average number of barrels imported 
daily increased to 865 million the highest level since the third 
quarter of 1977 from 797 million

chancellor helmut kohl today announced 
a plan to draw the two germanys into an informal confederation that 
eventually would lead to reunification west germanys major 
opposition party also called for unity 
in east germany a communist newspaper warned that society could 
collapse unless authorities stem emigration and punish corrupt 
officials hundreds of thousands took to the streets in five cities 
monday night in what has become a weekly ritual to maintain 
pressure on the ruling communists to enact reforms 
one of the biggest cheers among the 200000 demonstrators in 
leipzig came when a speaker urged a referendum on german unity 
east germanys leaders oppose reunification but a proposed 
confederation is being discussed the government in east berlin was 
expected to issue a statement on kohls remarks later today 
kohls 30minute address to parliament was the most thorough 
delineation of his vision of eliminating the partition imposed at 
the end of world war ii 
in a 10point plan he proposed taking steps to develop 
confederative structures between the two states in germany in order 
to create a federation a federal order 
he stressed however that such measures could only be 
undertaken if there are free elections in east germany that include 
nonsocialist parties east germanys new communist leaders have 
said such elections could be held as early as next fall 
kohl also said steps toward german reunification must be linked 
to improved eastwest relations and a new european order based on 
cooperation economic integration and greater freedom of movement 
the future structure of germany must fit into the whole 
architecture of europe as a whole he said 
kohl suggested the creation of consultative committees with east 
germany including a joint parliamantary panel 
such a coming together is in the interest of the continuation 
of german history kohl said 
earlier hansjochen vogel the leader of the opposition social 
democrats proposed a confederation between the german states as an 
interim step toward unity he also insisted german unity come as 
part of the process of overall european integration 
vogel used the word unity rather than formal 
reunification in his speech to parliament 
in the past the social democrats have cautioned against 
hastening toward reunification and some in the leftist party have 
opposed it 
the zdf television network said kohl gave no dates for the 
completion of his plan in an earlier talk with governing party 
lawmakers kohl has previously said he envisions a reunited germany 
existing peacefully with its neighbors and other countries 
the newspaper bild said kohls plan includes setting up joint 
committees to coordinate cooperation in economic matters crime 
prevention ecology and other domestic areas while leaving 
membership to nato and the warsaw pact untouched 
government spokesman hans klein said kohl may travel to east 
germany on dec 19 for talks on his proposals leaders of both 
germanys are under pressure to keep the reunification option open 
at the leipzig rally placards said germany united 
fatherland and at one point some demonstrators chanted the 
slogan another banner read the goal one germany 
one of the biggest cheers came when a worker helmut neubert 
called for a referendum on german reunification 
the fundamental question of reunification cannot be only a 
matter for politicans the people must decide whether they want 
it he said 
west germanys ultrarightist republican party issued an 
election platform monday calling for a reunited germany that would 
include territory lost in world war ii 
such calls deeply disturb poland where most of that territory 
is located and kohl has sought to reassure the poles that a 
reunified germany would have no designs on those lands 
in addition to the leipzig protest tens of thousands of 
protesters took to the streets monday night in dresden and halle 
while 10000 people protested in the city of schwerin the official 
east german news agency adn said 
under the pressure of a public demanding an end to 40 years of 
authoritarian oneparty rule east germany has undergone dizzying 
changes since party chief erich honecker was ousted oct 18 and 
replaced by egon krenz 
on nov 9 the berlin wall was opened and east germans were 
allowed to travel freely for the first time 
sen edward m kennedy today placed two white lilies at the city 
hall site of his brothers dramatic 1963 speech president kennedy 
said at the time ich bin ein berliner as a measure of 
solidarity with residents of the divided city 
kennedy dmass said the opening of the wall sparked the 
greatest march of liberty in modern times he later visited east 
berlin 
a frontpage editorial in berliner zeitung a communist party 
newspaper called for more action to punish suspected widespread 
corruption under the leadership of ousted party chief erich 
honecker 
every day that goes by without true signs of such action 
being given leads toward the collapse of society the editorial 
said

the justice department is trying to determine 
if an american church woman accused by el salvadors government of 
storing weapons for rebels violated us law an official said 
today 
friends of jennifer j casolo say the woman was framed by 
salvadoran authorities but the department is reviewing the case to 
determine if she violated the neutrality act said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the seldominvoked law bars private citizens from taking sides 
in foreign wars 
the official confirming a report in todays editions of the los 
angeles times stressed that the department was not conducting a 
formal investigation but said the fbi was reviewing the 
circumstances with prosecutors to determine if a legal violation 
existed 
casolo 28 was arrested saturday and salvadoran police 
confiscated tons of ammunition buried in the garden of her home 
they said the arms were stored there by guerrillas casolo had 
rented the house for three months with a roommate who left the 
country the morning before the raid 
acquaintances including the brother of sen christopher j 
dodd dconn said the church activist was the victim of a grudge 
in a country where a grudge can go a long way 
thomas j dodd a professor of latin american history at 
georgetown university said he did not believe that casolo was 
involved with the guerrillas 
casolo provided tours of el salvador as a representative of the 
san antonio texasbased christian education seminars to visiting 
church members and others professor dodd was on one of the tours 
last month 
she knew what was going on said dodd he and others who 
knew casolos work said she had a wide range of contacts ranging 
from high government officials to the poor 
lawrence h fuchs a brandeis university professor who remained 
in touch with casolo after her graduation in 1983 said his former 
student was afraid of the government in el salvador 
last year casolo wrote to fuchs that she had a misunderstanding 
with police officials and feared recriminations 
i am being watched very carefully she wrote i fear the 
lack of application of the law here a grudge can go a long way 
here and lowerlevel bureaucrats dont like to feel stupid 
casolos friends and associates say she is being framed to 
discredit church workers police said her arrest offered proof of 
church involvement with the guerrillas a claim that rightists in 
the salvadoran government have been eager to prove so they can 
expel foreign church workers active among the poor 
rep jim mcdermott dwash who has been on a medical 
factfinding trip in el salvador since thanksgiving day said in a 
statement from washington dc that he visited casolo for 45 
minutes monday and informed her that a lawyer was being retained 
sen dodd and rep nancy johnson rconn said they had been 
assured by state department officials that casolo was safe and in 
contact with us officials 
the senator a vociferous critic of us policies in el 
salvador did not comment directly on the charges but said he was 
disturbed the bush administration seemed already to have confirmed 
casolos guilt 
these are serious charges he said youre in a war zone 
down there people are doing crazy things 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
there are indications of her involvement thats for certain 
its fairly clear that these weapons were found there i mean 
were not talking about a small package of pistols here were 
talking about tons of equipment and mortars and dynamite and rounds 
of ammunitions and explosives this is hardly a case of someone 
having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way 
home fitzwater said 
casolo was in the custody of the national police said jeff 
brown a us embassy spokesman in el salvador he said she was 
being questioned and had not been charged 
under the stateofsiege imposed after the rebels launched an 
offensive against salvadoran cities on nov 11 authorities have up 
to 15 days to file charges or release someone instead of the normal 
72 hours 
brown said consular officials had been in regular contact with 
casolo and she had not been mistreated

a federal law aimed primarily at compensating 
injured dockworkers also applies to railroad employees who clean 
and repair dockside loading equipment the supreme court ruled 
today 
by a 90 vote the justices ruled that three injured railroad 
workers from virginia are limited to receiving benefits under the 
longshoremens and harbor workers compensation act 
the three had sought potentially greater compensation under a 
disability benefits law covering the railroad industry the federal 
employers liability act 
someone who repairs or maintains a piece of loading equipment 
is just as vital to and an integral part of the loading process 
as the operator of the equipment justice byron r white wrote 
for the court 
because such work is essential to the overall loading 
process he said the longshoremens act is the exclusive remedy 
for injuries suffered by people who perform such work 
nancy schwalb and william mcglone who did cleanup jobs for the 
chesapeake amp ohio railway co and robert goode jr a machinist 
for norfolk and western railway co all worked at coalloading 
terminals in the hampton roads va area 
ms schwalb suffered a serious head injury in 1983 when she fell 
from a catwalk while going to a nearby area to pick up spilled coal 
mcglones arm was nearly severed as he was picking up coal from 
beneath a moving conveyor belt that same year 
goode suffered a hand injury while repairing loading equipment 
in 1985 
the three sued their employers under the federal employers 
liability act the virginia supreme court allowed the suits after 
ruling that their jobs were not covered by the longshoremens act 
todays decision sparked by the two railroad companies 
appeals reversed the virginia supreme court ruling 
the appeals were supported by the association of american 
railroads its lawyers told the justices that 300000 people 
employed by association members could sue if injured for 
compensation if the virginia courts ruling were applied nationwide 
the determinative consideration is that the shiploading 
process could not continue unless the equipment that goode worked 
on was operating properly white said 
schwalb and mcglone also were performing duties essential to 
the overall loading process he said equipment cleaning that 
is necessary to keep machines operative is a form of maintenance 
the cases are camp0 railway vs schwalb 871979 and norfolk and 
western vs goode 88127

a federal jury today grappled with 
racketeering charges against three radicals one day after clearing 
them of trying to overthrow the us government 
the partial verdict acquitting the defendants of seditious 
conspiracy monday came on the 19th day of deliberations in the 
yearlong trial the jury said it had not reached agreement on five 
other charges against the 1970s militants 
prosecutors alleged the defendants in their early 40s were 
members of a terrorist group that plotted bombings and bank 
robberies on the east coast from 1976 to 1984 in a conspiracy to 
topple the us government 
two defendants raymond levasseur and richard williams already 
are serving lengthy terms for convictions in connection with some 
of the bombings patricia levasseur is free on bail after serving 
3 years of a fiveyear term for harboring a fugitive her husband 
raymond 
the partial verdict also cleared mrs levasseur of racketeering 
yet to be decided were charges of racketeering against the two men 
and charges of racketeering conspiracy against all three each 
count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and 20000 in fines 
the jury may have had trouble accepting the prosecutions 
argument that the littleknown defendants were a serious threat to 
the government said arthur wolf professor at western new england 
college of law 
i think the government was really overreaching frankly 
wolf said 
an april 1976 bombing at the suffolk county courthouse left one 
man with his leg severed below the knee but many of the bombings 
failed because of ineptitude 
i cant help believing that when youre talking about 
seditious conspiracy that the jurors would take into account in 
some respect the inability to carry out the plan wolf said 
the fact is that conspiracy to overthrow the government by 
violence is a ridiculous charge the government had no right to use 
it said elizabeth fink a defense attorney 
these are very broad statutes said mrs levasseur people 
get convicted of these charges without ever leaving home 
prosecutors declined comment on the partial verdict 
the trial began in january after being moved from boston jurors 
got the case nov 6 nearly 200 witnesses appeared and more than 
1700 exhibits were introduced 
there were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury 
selection in march 1988 part of a band whose members sometimes 
called themselves the united freedom front prosecutors dropped 
charges against two defendants a third pleaded guilty to sedition 
and other charges and a separate trial was ordered for a fourth 
prosecutors built their case around notebooks allegedly written 
by the defendants that the government charged provided a written 
record of meetings and plots 
but defense attorneys made light of the handwritten notebooks 
with one lawyer saying they might be a memoir glorifying 
revolutionary action either real or wished for 
levasseur who represented himself delivered an intense speech 
explaining his political evolution from his service in vietnam in 
the late 1960s describing himself as a soldier thats still at 
war 
while he did not admit to any of the charges he did speak about 
his desire to cry out against injustices in central america and 
south africa and said he had never betrayed his values

a deaf rutgers university law student has 
won a court order forcing the school to provide her with classroom 
notes 
us district judge stanley s brotman on monday ordered rutgers 
university school of law not to hold two classes attended by karen 
prince unless she receives notes within 24 hours of each class 
its all i wanted a notetaker said a tearful ms prince 
im very satisfied 
ms prince a thirdyear student who represented herself had 
sued under federal rehabilitation act of 1973 which requires 
recipients of federal funding to ensure that handicapped people 
receive equal benefits from programs 
the school had agreed to provide a notetaker or interpreter in 
a 1988 settlement of a lawsuit she filed in 1987 university 
attorney aron schwartz said the school spent about 10000 a year 
to provide sign language interpreters and notetakers for ms 
prince but has had trouble finding qualified candidates at one 
point ms prince rejected notes she said were illegible 
school officials last week circulated a request asking ms 
princes classmates to provide her with notes brotman said no one 
complied 
to leave it with the way its been done a hitormiss kind 
of thing were not getting anywhere said brotman ive got 
to satisfy that she gets that information 
it may cost rutgers some money but thats my least concern 
now rutgers gets plenty of money from the government he said 
ms prince 39 who expects to graduate in december said the 
case marks the first time federal civil rights provisions have been 
used to force a university to supply assistance for a deaf student 
it would be my hope that they would say wow theres a deaf 
person in law school i can do it too said ms prince who 
lost her hearing in 1972

pope john paul ii will ask soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to agree to permanent ties for the first time 
between the kremlin and the holy see a top vatican official said 
today 
gorbachev will arrive in italy on wednesday and meet with 
polishborn john paul on friday for the first talks between a 
leader of the worlds roman catholics and a soviet communist party 
chief 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro briefing reporters on the 
visit indicated that the issue of vaticanmoscow ties broken 
after the russian revolution in 1917 would be high on the popes 
agenda 
the holy see is asking for the possibility of a type of 
permanent stable relationship navarro said 
the official said it was premature to discuss the matter further 
but noted the united states was represented at the vatican by a 
personal envoy of the president even before diplomatic relations 
were established in 1983 
the historic audience on friday will cap a dramatic warming in 
vaticansoviet relations which were marked for decades by mutual 
hostility 
soviet rulers have viewed religion as a barrier to their 
nations revolutionary goals while roman pontiffs have preached 
that communism is evil 
navarro praised efforts under gorbachev to create a new 
relationship between the soviet state and believers 
but he said problems remain and that the vatican was waiting for 
the supreme soviet to take up a new law that would permit various 
sects to teach religion as well as practice it proselytizing is 
now banned 
the popes goal for the catholic church in the soviet union is 
the same as for any other country navarro said meaning it wants 
to freely nominate bishops open seminaries and control its own 
churches 
soviet spokesman gennady i gerasimov in rome preparing for the 
visit said the papal meeting was particularly important because 
its the first time ever 
they have talked for years about dialogue between christians 
and marxists this time it will be real gerasimov said 
christian values are human values and they are the same as 
socialist values he said

to update collections in todays highpriced art 
market museums increasingly must put a price on the priceless 
curators havent quite reached the level of ill trade you two 
picassos for a van gogh but museum boards are being forced to 
sell off some works to buy others budgets are simply dwarfed by 
the exponential growth in the price of auctioned art works 
in todays art market museums have a hard time buying said 
lori starr spokeswoman for the j paul getty museum in los angeles 
the museum of fine arts in boston for example has an 
acquisitions budget of about 2 million in a market where a 
vincent van gogh painting was recently sold for nearly 54 million 
that doesnt go far 
thursday the museum will put eight american paintings on the 
auction block to raise money to buy other american paintings the 
19th and 20th century paintings for sale include works by john 
singer sargent maurice prendergast albert bierstadt and george 
inness 
in the best of all possible worlds we could keep every 
painting and be able to add through the regular purchase fund 
said theodore e stebbins the museums curator for american 
paintings it used to be you could go down and buy wonderful 
things on the market with 2 million now you cant 
stebbins expects each painting to bring at least 36 million at 
the auction at sothebys in new york nearly twice the museums 
acquisition budget 
the getty museum planned to auction about 15 works today from j 
paul gettys private collection including paintings by gauguin and 
degas the expected 13 million to 16 million from the sothebys 
auction will go toward new purchases 
the sale of art to buy art is a very established regular 
procedure especially as a way of weeding out works of no great 
interest to the public said john ross spokesman for the 
metropolitan museum of art in new york 
if something has not been shown in 30 years or no other 
institute has asked to borrow it and if in the considered 
opinion of experts in the field it is not up to the quality of 
other works then it can be removed from the list of works in the 
museum and put up for auction he said monday 
ross said guidelines from the american association of museums 
stipulate that money from auctioned works may not go into daily 
expenses or expansion 
still any decision to sell part of a permanent collection is 
taken quite seriously said gettys starr the feelings of the 
auction candidates donor if there was one must be considered 
stebbins said 
stebbins said that museums must constantly update their 
collections to keep up with trends and new tastes the museum is 
a bureau of standards for art collectors he said we have to 
have the very best the highest quality 
the boston museums american collection was built mostly in the 
1940s now its 50 years later and there are painters and styles 
that are badly missing he said 
likewise a museum may feel it cannot do justice to a particular 
period and mmay decide to auction its collection in that area in 
the 1970s the metropolitan sold most of an ancient coin collection 
because it could not properly display the coins ross said 
the boston museum garnered some notoriety in 1985 for swapping 
two renoirs and a monet for troubled queen an abstract 
expressionist work by jackson pollock stebbins defended the swap 
saying the museum was weak in its holdings of moderns while it 
already had many great french impressionist works 
a museum also must consider its particular mission when 
acquiring or selling art the whitney museum in new york city 
auctioned its 19th century works after the board of directors 
determined that the museums goal was to highlight the 20th century 
our thought on the 19th century is that either we do it well 
or we dont do it at all said susan larson permanent collection 
curator 
no one in the artloving public should be afraid of a favorite 
painting going on the block said eileen harakal spokeswoman for 
chicagos art institute we have icons that will always be here 
things that are always untouchable the overwhelming majority of 
our collection is not going anywhere

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter head of 
a us delegation bound for poland announced today he will present 
a 20 million foodforpeace installment to the poles during the 
visit 
but yeutter cautioned against raising unrealistic expectations 
for the economies of poland or other eastern european countries 
saying economic reform is bound to lag behind political advances 
economic reform is not an overnight proposition yeutter 
said it will take time it would be tragic indeed if all the 
magnificant emotion of the moment is channeled into frustration 
yeutter spoke with reporters at a white house briefing as the 
delegation prepared to leave for its fiveday trip to poland 
besides yeutter the delegation includes labor secretary 
elizabeth dole commerce secretary robert mosbacher and an 
assortment of us business and labor leaders 
mrs dole told the briefing that there will be initial pain 
including increased unemployment for a workforce used to the 
communist system low wages little room for advancement and no 
encouragement for individual initiative or innovations 
she said the administration was prepared to offer poles 
assistance in easing this pain including consultations on 
establishing worker training and retraining programs 
mosbacher said he will spend part of his time in poland pursuing 
opportunities for uspolish business ventures and agreements 
yeutter said that during the visit he would announce a 20 
million installment in us food aid to help poland get through the 
winter the aid is part of 100 million in food aid announced by 
the administration last summer 
at the same time yeutter sounded a pessimistic note on short 
term prospects for the economies of poland and its neighboring east 
bloc states 
we just be careful that economic expectations do not become 
unrealistic he said in the kind of emotional environment that 
exists today that can very readily occur 
each of these countries has experience 40 years or more of 
ignominious failure of the communist system they are now seeking 
to convert overnight into a system that is much more nearly 
comparable to one weve been honing for 200 years 
the delegation was to leave tonight and return back to 
washington on saturday yeutter said a report would be delivered to 
president bush before christmas

a member of the us national 
transportation safety board was killed along with two venezuelan 
pilots when their small plane crashed in hills west of the city 
us embassy officials said today 
there were conflicting reports about the number of injured and 
their identities 
embassy officials said five us diplomats aboard the 
twinengine cessna 402 were seriously injured in the crash which 
occurred monday evening apparently in bad weather 
in washington ntsb spokesman alan pollock said four passengers 
were injured 
killed in the crash was joseph trippe nall 47 who served on 
the fivemember ntsb since 1986 officials said the planes 
pilots dickson naranjo and jose vargas also were killed embassy 
officials said 
the plane apparently was headed to the charallave municipal 
airport in the hills west of caracas when it crashed venezuelan 
transportation officials said 
pollock said nall was in caracas to give a speech to the 
venezuelan aeronautical congress and that he and his party were on 
a cave airlines flight around the caracas area the plane crashed 
as it tried to land in fog 
investigators from the venezuelan transport ministry were on the 
scene today pollock said the board would send an investigating 
team to caracas later today and that ntsb chairman jim kolstad 
would accompany the investigators 
us embassy officials said five survivors a woman and four 
men were being treated in a caracas hospital and apparently were 
in grave condition 
nalls assistant kenneth peppard was among the injured 
pollock said 
john leyden a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration said in washington that two faa employees also were 
among the injured he identified them as david hanley who worked 
at an faa hangar at washington national airport and jerri alles 
an employee of the agencys international aviation office 
a fourth passenger was identified as kay bond a producer at 
maryland public television for the show am weather an indepth 
weather program that is distributed nationwide 
it is our understanding that she has not sustained any 
injuries although she is still in the hospital being checked 
said sharon philippart national promotions manager for maryland 
public television it was my understanding that she was on 
vacation she was not traveling for mpt 
nall a lawyer from smithfield nc was appointed to the board 
april 11 1986 by president reagan his term was due to expire 
dec 31 1992

had preached at baptist churches in halifax va and smithfield 
nall also was a pilot and had operated nall aviation 
enterprises a ground school at johnston county airport in 
smithfield the ntsb said 
nalls death leaves a vacancy on the fivemember board which 
must be filled by presidential appointment by law the position 
must go to a democrat to keep a political balance on the board 
which now has three republicans and one democrat 
the safety board investigates transportation accidents and 
incidents determines their cause and makes recommendations to 
other agencies and organizations to increase safety

consumers will see 1990 food prices rise at a 
much slower pace as farmers continue expanding crop production a 
senior agriculture department economist predicted tuesday 
the 1990 food outlook calls for larger supplies and lower 
prices said james r donald chairman of the departments world 
agricultural outlook board record meat production bigger crops 
and slowing inflation will hold the retail food prices increase to 
3 percent to 5 percent in 1990 
food prices this year are rising nearly 6 percent the sharpest 
annual increase since 1981 part of the reason for this years 
runup prices gained 41 percent on the average in 1988 were 
the lingering effects of last years drought 
donald who presented a paper at the departments annual outlook 
conference said us crop production is likely to increase in 1990 
as farmers further expand plantings and yields improve 
world crop production is recovering from last years reduced 
level he said but for most crops production in 1989 will 
not match continued high levels of use 
next year donald said world commodity consumption will reach a 
record level in response to larger output continued economic 
expansion and population growth 
prices of farm commodities will be relatively strong because of 
demand and lower inventories although prices of feed grains and 
soybeans will ease from the droughtdriven levels of 1988 and early 
1989 
this outlook suggests us farmers can look forward to another 
year of favorable income donald said increased marketing 
receipts are anticipated because of larger commodity output and 
higher prices for some commodities 
lower feed costs will help stabilize farm production expenses in 
1990 thus even with lower government payments farmers are 
expected to have a net cash income next year of 52 billion to 57 
billion up from a revised forecast of 52 billion to 54 billion 
for 1989 he said 
previously usda had forecast 1989 net cash income at a record 
599 billion up from the previous high of 577 billion in 1987 
donald said the 1989 forecast was revised downward because 
production expenses turned out higher than previously anticipated 
net cash income is simply the difference between gross cash 
income and cash expenses the amount of money farmers have to 
spend in a year 
in another method of accounting net farm income includes 
allowances for changes in inventory values and other adjustments 
including values for family dwelling and other items 
under that method donald said 1990 net farm income may be in 
the range of 46 billion to 49 billion down from this years 
record 48 billion to 50 billion 
crop yields were slightly below trend this year reflecting 
drought damage to the winter wheat crop and lessthannormal 
conditions for several other crops he said subsoil moisture 
conditions in the corn belt are much improved over a year ago 
donald said that for the combined crops of wheat feed grains 
and soybeans the projected trend yield for 1990 is up nearly 
25 percent from the actual yields of 1989 
even with reduced soybean production likely combined grain 
and soybean production could be up 5 percent to 7 percent next year 
if trend yields are realized and harvested acreage is up 3 percent 
to 4 percent he said

when president bush and mikhail gorbachev 
phone home from their malta summit this weekend electronic spies 
nearby will record the transmissions and save them for years in 
hope of one day cracking the codes 
no matter how friendly their relations both leaders will bring 
their best eavesdroppers electronic equipment encoding machines 
and countermeasure experts to the mediterranean rendezvous 
according to knowledgeable officials and observers 
its a great opportunity for us to see what they can do and 
vice versa said one former government expert who declined to be 
identified by name any signals they cant identify or decode 
theyll turn over to contractors or the national security agency to 
play with 
if anybody wants to study antennas thats the place to go 
said james bamford author of a book on us electronic spying 
experts in and out of the government paint this picture of 
spying opportunities at the shipboard summit 
each presidents communications with experts at home will be 
intercepted but it appears both transmissions are too well 
encrypted for the other side to read 
the signals will be preserved perhaps for years in case a 
defector or a technological breakthrough may one day unlock the 
codes 
it is possible but unlikely that the soviets could eavesdrop 
on private strategy sessions between bush and his aides without 
us knowledge the soviets have had more opportunity than us 
agents to plant the bugs required for such eavesdropping if only 
because communistled shipyard workers have worked on the uss 
belknap in france since it was named as bushs summit ship 
the meeting aboard us and soviet missile cruisers will be 
more secure from such bugging than any site the us side could 
have picked except washington and both sides might think twice 
about planting bugs that could cause big embarrassment if 
discovered 
bamford said the navy still sends some lesssecure messages 
through encoding machines whose designs the soviets obtained from 
the john walker spy ring he said us officials believe that with 
those spies in prison the soviets can no longer get updated key 
cards necessary to decode the signals 
the presidents most secure messages however will travel 
through separate switchboards code machines and satellite uplinks 
brought to the belknap by the white house communications agency 
according to current and former government officials 
when the satellite beams messages to washington the signal is 
so broad that a soviet listening post in cuba receives it but 
bamford and the former government expert said the dishes which 
transmit to the satellite also spill their signals sideways a mile 
or more so both soviet and us technicians can pick up the 
others satellite transmissions as they leave the ships 
the toughest trick would be to monitor either bush or gorbachev 
in strategy sessions before and after their facetoface meetings 
you would have to get a device on board said harold 
lipsett a san francisco detective expert in eavesdropping he and 
other experts said lasers aimed at portholes or induction coils 
attached to ship hulls would be detected easily and would not pick 
up clear signals 
maybe you can bug the room lipsett said noting that 
devices are very small but getting the signal out would be 
extremely difficult because theres heavy metal surrounding all 
the rooms on a ship i would hate the assignment 
the belknap publicly identified as bushs summit ship on oct 
31 was in the dcan shipyard in toulon france from august until 
nov 8 getting an overhaul and better communications the shipyard 
employs 5000 civilians who belong to two unions one led by 
socialists and the other by communists 
still the ship will be more secure than any land site where 
you have many more opportunities to get in or even to build 
microphones into the walls lipsett said 
for instance vienna host to summits in 1961 and 1979 has been 
a spys playground in the early 1950s us and british spies 
tunneled to and tapped soviet cables in 1986 marine embassy guard 
clayton lonetree confessed to meeting soviet officials there and in 
moscow felix bloch under investigation as a soviet spy served as 
economic counselor and deputy chief of mission from 1980 to 1987 
the former government expert said secret service specialists 
will sweep the belknap nonstop with a spectrum of signals to 
activate hidden transmitters finetuned monitors will be used to 
pick up piggyback signals millisecond transmissions a 
fraction off the frequency of commercial radio broadcasts where 
they sound like a blip of static he said 
but bamford said repeated soviet successes in bugging the us 
embassy in moscow show they are more advanced in miniaturization 
of undetectable bugs 
from 1945 to 1952 a great seal of the united states contained a 
device which monitored the us ambassador there from 1976 to 
1984 transmitters were hidden in embassy typewriters 
and in 1985 construction of a new embassy was halted there 
were hundreds thousands of real and fake devices in concrete we 
let the soviets deliver to the site one congressional source 
said 
some experts blame lax us counterintelligence in moscow for 
those soviet successes but we assume our guys do their best job 
whenever the president is involved said another congressional 
source

question time parliaments most popular event 
went on live television tuesday giving viewers a closeup of prime 
minister margaret thatcher under verbal siege 
for a fastmoving 15 minutes mrs thatcher fielded questions on 
eastern europe working mothers her talks with president bush the 
auto industry northern ireland homeless youth the national water 
supply and her prospects for extending her 10year spell in office 
the cut and thrust was less than savage no honorable member was 
expelled for using unparliamentary language and mrs thatcher 
didnt have to do much shouting 
it was historic nonetheless being the first question time 
starring mrs thatcher since the cameras began rolling in the house 
of commons a week ago and her first such exchange since declaring 
that any talk of her retirement was premature 
question time is a twiceweekly fixture with a code and style 
all its own 
members hand in their questions ahead of time then try to catch 
the eye of the gowned bewigged speaker who calls on questioners at 
random trying to balance pro and antigovernment questions 
the questioners can table a substantive question but that gives 
mrs thatcher time to prepare an answer or they can ask her simply 
to list her engagements for the day then follow up with anything 
they please 
the latter tactic is intended to trip the prime minister and 
unleash howls of derision from the backbenches 
tuesdays session opened with an easy lob from a conservative on 
the governments plans to reform the national health service mrs 
thatcher 64 put on her glasses and read aloud extracts from a 
newspaper article by a doctor not of our political persuasion 
praising the reforms 
up bobbed neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party 
grilling mrs thatcher on an official report that the government 
sold off an ailing stateowned automaker too cheaply 
mrs thatcher replied that considering the company had hardly 
ever made a profit in recent years selling it was a major 
achievement 
the conservatives usually ask the friendly questions the 
opposition lawmakers ask the tough ones often they are merely 
statements disguised as questions which could be summed up as 
follows would mrs thatcher agree that she is terrific awful 
brilliant dumb etc 
bob cryer of labor belligerently posed his question about water 
supplies to the aspiring presidentforlifeandprimeminister 
and predicted mrs thatcher would be swept from office and dumped 
in the garbage of her own policies 
mrs thatcher ignored the barb and answered that her plans to 
sell off the national water supply would be a big success 
michael carttiss a tory asked whether mrs thatcher was aware 
that he and his constituents believe she should stay on as prime 
minister 
im very grateful to my honorable friend she replied with a 
smile im quite sure that his constituents and he are both 
right

the soviet navy is expected to have four 
combat ships capable of using nuclear weaponry in the mediterranean 
during the upcoming bushgorbachev saltwater summit a pentagon 
spokesman said today 
the soviet union is expected to have four nuclearcapable 
combatants and four auxiliaries in the med during the malta 
meeting spokesman fred hoffman told reporters 
the statement followed a published report that the pentagon had 
observed a withdrawal of such soviet vessels possibly in 
anticipation of a gorbachev initiative to declare the region a 
nuclearfree zone 
hoffman said the soviet group will include three guided missile 
frigates the slava guided missile cruiser which will be the site 
of talks on saturday between presidents bush and gorbachev and 
four other support vessels 
there is no evidence that the soviets plan to vacate the med 
during the weekend summit said one defense official monday 
speaking on condition of anonymity said on monday 
another official who also spoke privately said the soviets 
still have a submarine presence in the mediterranean and are 
expected to continue to do so through the dec 23 shipboard summit 
off malta 
the two leaders are scheduled to share a dinner saturday night 
aboard the us host vessel the uss belknap the guided missile 
cruiser that is a command ship for the us sixth fleet in the 
mediterranean 
the us navy will be out in force during the summit 
represented in the mediterranean by some 25 combat ships 
including the aircraft carrier uss forrestal and the dozen 
destroyers cruisers and frigates that compose its battle group 
also in the area is an amphibious ready group composed of five 
ships ready to deploy some 2400 marines said navy spokesman cmdr 
craig quigley 
while the defense official confirmed there is a slight 
depression in the number of soviet combat ships present in the 
area compared to about a year ago he argued that such a cut could 
be due as much to economical as political considerations 
about a year ago the pentagon counted about six to 10 soviet 
combatants in the region with a range of 12 to 24 support ships 
during the summit the number is expected to range from about four 
to six major combat ships with a few more support vessels the 
official said 
all of the soviet combat ships are capable of using nuclear 
weapons the official said 
our intelligence tells us that this dip appears to be part of 
a normal rotation whether it is a permanent retrenchment or a 
temporary aberration we just dont know the official said 
the official noted that during the past months the united 
states has received evidence of a worldwide downturn in sovet naval 
activity a step that was widely interpreted as being taken due to 
pressures on the soviet economy

waited two years in this british colony boarded a plane tuesday for 
their journey to the west in the largest oneday resettlement of 
refugees from hong kong in seven years 
most of the vietnamese will go the the united states after six 
months in the philippines to study english and learn about life in 
the united states 
others were sent to sweden and australia government statistics 
showed that was the largest oneday resettlement of vietnamese 
refugees in seven years 
another 12700 vietnamese refugees still are waiting in hong 
kong to be resettled in the west 
more than 5000 will be resettled in mid1990 said alfred 
kottek the regional representative of the intergovernmental 
committee for migration who organized the refugees transportion 
the refugees in hong kong either arrived before june 1988 or 
were classified as refugees under a screening policy 
in june 1988 the government adopted a policy that treats all 
vietnamese boat people as illegal immigrants unless they prove they 
are fleeing persecution those classed as illegal immigrants face 
repatriation to their communist homeland 
nearly 44000 vietnamese boat people in hong kong are waiting to 
be screened so far this year 33889 have arrived compared with 
18052 in the same period of 1988 most wont be classified as 
refugees 
francis maude of the british foreign office said forcible 
repatriation of vietnamese boat people from hong kong will begin by 
february or march 
on thursday 132 vietnamese boat people including 12 babies

the us government is entitled to some of the 
money american companies are awarded by an international tribunal 
created as part of the settlement of the 1981 iran hostage crisis 
a unanimous supreme court ruled tuesday 
the justices said the companies rights are not violated by 
requiring them rather than all us taxpayers to help defray 
the costs of the claims settlement process 
the court upheld a 1985 law that allows the us government to 
deduct 15 percent of the first 5 million recovered by any company 
and 1 percent of anything exceeding that amount 
justice byron r white writing for the court said the 
deductions are reasonable even if they do not equal the amount of 
money the government expended to help the companies win their 
claims 
this court has never held that the amount of a user fee must 
be precisely calibrated to the use that a party makes of government 
services he said nor does the government need to record 
invoices and billable hours to justify the costs of its services 
white rejected arguments by sperry corp that forcing companies 
to pay the fees is an unconstitutional confiscation of their 
property and that any costs to the government should be borne by 
the nation as a whole 
as we see it sperry has not identified any of its property 
that was taken without just compensation he said 
the bush administration said tens of millions of dollars were at 
stake including some 127 million already deducted by the us 
government from claims paid to companies 
the financial deal that freed the 52 american hostages from iran 
in 1981 included the us governments release of billions of 
dollars in frozen iranian assets and creation of an international 
tribunal to resolve claims against iran 
the supreme court in 1981 upheld the power of former president 
carter to approve the settlement and that was not at issue in 
tuesdays ruling 
sperry corp which leased computer systems to iran before the 
1979 hostage crisis severed relations between the united states and 
that country was awarded 28 million by the international claims 
tribunal 
the us government deducted 42000 for its expenses in helping 
sperry 
tuesdays decision overturned a federal appeals court ruling 
last year that the deduction was an unconstitutional seizure of 
private property 
the high court ruling is not related directly to recent 
developments suggesting eased tensions between iran and the united 
states 
the bush administration announced three weeks ago that the 
united states is returning 567 million in frozen assets to iran a 
move president bush said he hopes will prompt tehran to push for 
freedom for american hostages in lebanon 
the 567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by 
american banks against iran 
in another case the high court ruled 90 that a federal law 
aimed primarily at compensating injured dockworkers also applies to 
railroad employees who clean and repair dockside loading equipment 
it ruled that three injured railroad workers from virginia are 
limited to receiving benefits under the longshoremens and harbor 
workers compensation act they had sought potentially greater 
compensation under a disability law covering the railroad industry 
the federal employers liability act

the space shuttle columbia was 
transported to a refurbished launch pad tuesday for a christmastime 
mission to deploy one satellite and retrieve another the size of a 
bus before it falls to earth 
the shuttles five astronauts rode along for part of the way on 
the giant tracked vehicle that moved columbia to pad 39a on a 
sixhour 42mile trip from an assembly building 
the last shuttle launched from pad 39a was columbia in january 
1986 
all eight shuttle flights since then have lifted off neighboring 
pad 39b while workers gave 39a a 50 million facelift they added 
safety features and improved electrical fuel line environmental 
control and other systems 
nasa now has two pads as it moves into a busy schedule that 
calls for nine shuttle flights in 1990 
astronaut dan brandenstein who will command columbia commended 
the workers who did the pad overhaul 
about a month ago just about everyone around here would not 
have guessed that pad a would be ready he told reporters but 
because of a great effort by all the folks as you can see its 
ready to go 
were looking forward to going on dec 18 and spending 
christmas in orbit for 10 days and getting a lot of things 
accomplished and getting ldef back 
ldef is the long duration exposure facility an 11ton 
30footlong satellite that is expected to reenter the atmosphere 
and break up in february if it is not recovered 
nasa has said there is only a remote possibility of anyone 
getting hurt by falling debris 
but the space agency and the defense department want the 
spacecraft back to find out what has happened to the materials and 
experiments on board during their lengthy exposure to 
weightlessness radiation vacuum and micrometeorites the results 
would help in designing nasas permanent space station and the star 
wars missile shield 
ldef was put in orbit in 1984 by another shuttle crew and was to 
have been retrieved 10 months later but launch delays and the 
challenger disaster in 1986 postponed the effort for years 
before tracking down ldef on the fourth day of the mission the 
astronauts are to release a navy communications satellite named 
syncom 
columbias other crew members are pilot jim wetherbee and 
mission specialists bonnie dunbar marsha ivins and david low

the top government commission for public 
works suggested tuesday the famed leaning tower of pisa be closed 
for restoration work 
the recommendation by the superior council of public works was 
passed along to parliament which must make the final decision 
experts recently have voiced alarm about decay in the 162foot 
tower completed between 1360 and 1370 local officials counter 
that the monument which attracts thousands of tourists every 
month is not in any immediate danger 
the commission did not say it could collapse it said the 
closure would allow conservation work to begin 
its tilt has been increasing by an average 0047 inches a year 
since measurements began in 1918 it has remained open to tourists 
even through world war ii 
gero geri a professor of topography has said it will take more 
than 100 years before the tower reaches the point where it will 
likely fall 
the government allotted funds for the conservation and 
strengthening of the tower but experts have been stumped on how to 
save the building which a popular italian song says leans 
leans but never comes down

president bush signed legislation tuesday 
approving a boundary compact between south dakota and nebraska 
involving a 12mile stretch of the missouri river 
the compact sets the boundary at the midpoint of the main river 
channel between union county sd and dakota county neb 
the two states originally agreed to set the border at the 
midpoint of the missouri river channel in 1905 but since then the 
river has shifted due to both natural causes and corps of engineers 
navigation and flood control projects 
the new compact establishes the current midpoint of the river as 
the boundary it provides for future adjustments should the river

gov buddy roemer today denied clemency for a 
retarded man scheduled to go to the electric chair thursday for 
murdering a state trooper at 17 
roemer rejected the recommendation of the louisiana pardon 
board which voted 32 monday that he commute dalton prejeans 
sentence to life in prison 
the governors announcement came minutes after the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals in new orleans turned down an appeal from 
prejean now 30 
louisianas longestserving death row inmate is scheduled to die 
shortly after midnight on thursday for the 1977 slaying of trooper 
donald cleveland prejean has been on death row for nearly 12 years 
the us supreme helped clear the way for his execution in july 
when it ruled in separate cases that the constitutions ban on 
cruel and unusual punishment does not bar the execution of 
murderers who are retarded or were juveniles when they killed 
in virginia and alabama two killers described respectively as 
borderline retarded and mildly retarded were put to death in august 
and july after the ruling 
yvonne foreman chairman of the pardon board said the majority 
voted for clemency based on testimony that prejean had been abused 
as a child that he probably suffered some brain damage as a child 
and that he had a good prison record and showed remorse 
the appeals argued that prejean who is black had an allwhite 
jury and an ineffective courtappointed lawyer the jury was never 
told that he was abused as a child that he is mildly retarded or 
that he was drinking heavily the night of the murder 
six months before the killing prejean was released from a 
reform school to which he had been sent for killing a taxi driver 
at age 14 
prejean has expressed his regrets to the family of the trooper 
he shot twice in the face with a 38caliber pistol after a traffic 
stop 
i ask them not to hate me for all of their life said 
prejean who was shackled during his testimony before the board at 
the state prison that same hate can destroy them 
prejean blamed most of his problems on an unhappy childhood i 
was always charged with being wrong even when i tried to do right 
david baer a psychiatrist at the university of massachusetts 
school of medicine said he examined prejean in 1984 and believes 
that while prejean knows right from wrong apparent brain damage 
makes it difficult for him to deliberate when in a violent mood 
if allowed to live prejean could be the subject of tests that 
might help others with similar brain problems to avoid violence 
baer said 
his death would teach us absolutely nothing he said 
david smith father of the troopers widow and spoksman for the 
family said clevelands relatives wanted justice not revenge 
if were going to have a death penalty lets use it if we 
dont want it lets do away with it but lets dont drag these 
things out 12 years

the streets of prague were quiet 
tuesday for the first time since a crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 11 days ago drove the people to demand reform 
the main opposition group civic forum called for a temporarily 
end to the mass demonstrations that set the city center in motion 
small groups nevertheless continued to gather in wenceslas square 
to discuss the changes 
we have courage again a student said i dont think 
anyone can shut us up again 
czechs and slovaks who once before lived through democratic 
reforms of 1968 long were reluctant to challenge the hardline 
leadership put in place after sovietled troops crushed the 
prague spring 
but that changed after nov 17 when hundreds were beaten in an 
unmatched display of brutality as police broke up a crowd of 
50000 who dared call for reforms 
the student was one of hundreds who gathered on wenceslas 
square the heart of the prodemocracy movement to discuss the 
changes that brought down the leadership of milos jakes and forced 
premier ladislav adamec to talk to the opposition 
after a meeting with the opposition tuesday adamec pledged to 
form a coalition government by dec 3 and prague residents clearly 
were elated by the thought of noncommunists sharing power for the 
first time in decades 
after years of silence we can talk freely again said an 
old woman who like the others at the square spoke rapidly 
without taking the time to give her name democracy has already 
won 
the crowd repeatedly sang the national anthem and waved their 
hands in v for victory signs doffing their hats despite the 
freezing temperatures 
the statue of king wenceslas a towering figure on horseback 
was draped with flags and banners candles flickered along its base 
lines formed outside shops along the square to read the daily 
prodemocracy bulletins taped in the windows and people eagerly 
read new leaflets printed during the night 
one young warehouse worker referring to adamecs promise of a 
new government said it would be transitional but was 
nevertheless positive 
more important is the promise that the communist party will 
give up its leading role he said alluding to agreement to 
remove such language from a new constitution 
many older people joined the students on the square it was 
largely the students backed by artists and intellectuals who have 
carried the democracy movement 
a box for donations to the students movement was quickly 
filled nearly everyone who stopped on the square to join the 
discussions or passed by threw in money even pensioners dropped in 
a few coins 
its as though the people of prague have suddenly awakened 
said a woman listening nearby only a few weeks ago they were 
only interested in their car their weekend house and food now 
politics is at the forefront like in 1968 
people have been reluctant to get involved in politics after 
their experiences 21 years ago the country has one of the highest 
living standards in the soviet bloc and consumer goods are more 
plentiful than elsewhere 
weve fought ourselves free a worker on the square

alcoholism centers from new england to 
arizona are opening their doors this week to 110 soviets eager to 
see how the disease is treated in this country 
the soviets were to spend monday and tuesday in stamford before 
splitting into groups to tour treatment centers in 11 states over 
two weeks 
american and soviet views of alcoholism differ in the united 
states where an estimated 18 million adults have a drinking 
problem the disease is seen as societal and affecting the 
drinkers family treatment focuses on why one drinks 
the soviets have placed more attention on physical approaches 
such as acupuncture and liver dialysis only 5 million soviets are 
recognized officially as alcoholics needing treatment but 
conference delegates estimate an additional 15 million or more are 
problem drinkers 
i hope that while theyre here they will learn a great deal 
how the family gets enmeshed in the disease and needs its own 
recovery said anne geller a director of a new york treatment 
center who helped organize the conference 
they also i hope will learn the importance of destigmatizing 
alcoholism and treating it as any other disorder she said no 
one in the soviet union would get up and say im a recovering 
alcoholic whereas people here do it all the time 
betty ford the former first lady who has reinforced that 
approach by proclaiming she is a recovering alcoholic greeted some 
of the delegates sunday night the betty ford treatment center in 
rancho mirage calif is among the conference hosts 
this is the second meeting for the experts who first exchanged 
information at an april conference in moscow attended by about 100 
americans 
the conference was the brainchild of father luis dolan a roman 
catholic priest who coordinates soviet exchanges for the wainwright 
house in rye ny dolan who has visited the soviet union several 
times said some of the questions he heard most often on his early 
trips had to do with alcoholism 
something just touched me here he said striking his chest 
with a fist when they said can we organize a conference 
the soviet delegates include scientists recovering alcoholics 
and treatment specialists as well as ballet dancers who belong to 
an antidrug and alcohol group 
delegation leader levon badalyan president of the european 
association of neurologists said he admires the american concept 
of using the schools to teach young children about drug and alcohol 
abuse he also approves of president bushs attacks on drugs and 
the use of actors athletes and other prominent citizens to 
discourage drug abuse 
he was not impressed by a soviet effort to crack down on 
excessive drinking by raising prices restricting where liquor is 
sold and raising the drinking age for liquor to 21 
the point is that such restrictive measures breed bootlegging 
production of homemade alcohol and worse cases of alcoholism 
appear he said 
the way to overcome alcoholism in my view is through raising 
the general cultural level of society raising it spiritually 
providing a person with specific goals in his life and finally 
impressing on the person that alcoholism is a bad habit he said 
the conference will take badalyan and other delegates to halfway 
houses outpatient clinics and other treatment centers which are 
much smaller than those in the soviet union where the largest 
alcoholism facility has 6000 beds

a man whose fatally wounded victim 
used deathbed eye blinks to identify him as the assailant was 
sentenced tuesday to six months in jail 
god brought him back for a few moments to communicate with 
detectives westchester county court judge john lacava said of 
frederick sannicandro 38 
sannicandro died six hours after he was shot in the abdomen by 
his friend frank zollbrecht 45 as they were working in a yonkers 
bakery last year 
while he was being wheeled into surgery detectives and an 
attending physician questioned sannicandro and asked him to respond 
with one blink for yes and two blinks for no 
sannicandro blinked yes when asked if zollbrecht had shot 
him and no when asked if the shooting was accidental according 
to trial testimony 
he could not speak because he had a breathing tube in his throat 
zollbrecht had a history of alcohol abuse according to 
testimony during drunken horseplay he got a gun his boss had 
hidden and shot sannicandro 
the defense maintained that sannicandros deathbed testimony 
should not have been allowed because sannicandro also was drunk 
zollbrecht convicted of criminally negligent homicide could 
have been sentenced to four years in prison assistant district 
attorney michael romano argued for a oneyear term saying the 
defendant had ignored warnings about drinking and the gun 
zollbrechts lawyer anthony morosco said his client had been 
traumatized at age 7 by the death of an older brother hes a 
good person who has suffered a series of great tragedies in his 
life morosco said 
a tearful zollbrecht told the judge i would never hurt 
freddy im sorry for what happened what can i say im sorry i 
touched the gun im sorry 
lacava ordered that zollbrecht spend five years on probation 
after his prison term do 1000 hours of community service and get 
treatment for his drinking and any psychological problems

defense secretary dick cheney pledged 
tuesday the united states wont withdraw troops from europe without 
consulting the allies officials said at the first nato meeting 
since the berlin wall was opened 
the united states will continue to have its forces in europe 
as long as our nato allies want them and need them there said 
a senior us defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
we are in europe to stay the official quoted cheney as 
telling other defense ministers at the start of two days of talks 
at the north atlantic treaty organization 
reports about us plans to reduce its military spending in the 
coming years have prompted concern that the united states intended 
to pare its commitment to the defense of the european continent 
more than 300000 us troops are based in europe most in west 
germany 
but cheney used the meeting to explain to his colleagues the 
us budget process and calm any fears about us intentions in the 
future 
britains secretary of state for defense tom king said cheney 
gave clear assurances of an absolute commitment to consultation 
that the united states is here ready to play its full part in 
nato and in europe 
german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said we are 
talking about plans for the mid1990s 
i take the position that the united states will not change its 
stance in the current conventional arms negotiations he said 
the 16 nations of nato and the seven of the sovietled warsaw 
pact are holding negotiations in vienna austria to reduce sharply 
conventional or nonnuclear arms in europe 
president bush proposed in may that as part of those talks the 
soviet union and the united states cut their forces in europe to 
275000 soldiers each that would require a cutback of 300000 in 
soviet forces and 30000 in us troops 
those negotiations are expected to end with an agreement in the 
last half of 1990 
cheney told the ministers that speculation about us troop 
cutbacks stemmed from the defense departments look at its budgets 
in the 19921995 period according to the us official no final 
budget decisions have been made 
he promised the allies the official said that the united 
states will not make any unilateral reductions in troops and 
that any reductions would be considered in the nato context and in 
full consultation with our allies 
no figure was given for possible troop cuts in the future he 
said 
he noted congress has in recent years sliced the pentagons 
budget requests and that trend was likely to continue 
moreover the budget plans were being drawn up he said based 
on assumptions of a conventional arms agreement a superpower 
accord on longrange nuclear missiles no major military conflicts 
in the third world and continued political reforms in eastern 
europe 
the worst case projection he said was likely for 180 billion 
in reductions over four years still he said the united states 
intended to spend 300 billion a year on defense in the mid1990s 
the official said no troops would be pulled out of europe in the 
1990 fiscal year which began oct 1 except for those reduced 
because of the 1987 superpower treaty on intermediaterange nuclear 
forces 
the 1991 defense budget which will be sent to congress in 
january was not expected to trim us forces in europe he said 
with the dramatic events unfolding in eastern europe nato 
officials have been concerned that western nations will lower their 
defense spending even before an arms deal is struck 
norwegian gen vigleik eide head of natos panel of military 
commanders said the soviet union and its eastern allies remain a 
powerful military might 
he acknowledged the startling reforms in the soviet union and 
eastern europe have lowered public perceptions of the military 
threat from the east 
support for defense efforts in the future will be problematic 
because of the perception of the threat as already gone he said 
but he insisted the wests policy should be guided by force 
levels 
the berlin wall has not much to do with military realities 
and does not change the military forces he said 
leaders of the nato nations will meet monday to learn the 
results of bushs shipboard summit dec 23 with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
nato defense ministers meet twice a year in their role as the 
defense planning committee france which is outside natos 
military structure does not attend iceland which has no armed

the united states could cut its defense 
spending by 145 billion over 10 years and still maintain its 
military capability by delaying production of the next generation 
of strategic weapons two defense analysts said tuesday 
procurement of such highpriced items as the b2 stealth bomber 
and the advanced tactical fighter the costs of which have pushed 
the current pentagon budget to 305 billion could remain in the 
testing stage until fastmoving developments in eastern europe come 
into focus 
since weve just gone through a wartime buildup without a war 
theres no reason to rush into strategic modernization said 
lawrence j korb a former reagan administration defense official 
who addressed a news conference at the brookings institution we 
should postpone until we see what happens in the world 
on the heels of stunning democratic reforms in the eastern bloc 
nations and the demise of the berlin wall the call for a reduction 
in the us defense budget has grown louder 
defense secretary dick cheney has been pondering sweeping 
changes including cuts of several thousand in us armed forces 
elimination of 100 navy ships and closing of at least a dozen air 
force bases according to pentagon officials who requested 
anonymity 
the pentagon is expected to submit its fiscal 1991 budget plan 
with a possible cut of 20 billion from a 317 billion spending 
level to the office of management and budget by dec 8 the 
officials said 
another speaker at the news conference william w kaufmann a 
harvard university lecturer and pentagon veteran said the cuts 
would reduce the current defense budget of 305 billion to 160 
billion by 1999 the cumulative reduction would add up to 500 
billion in savings 
among kaufmanns proposals in the first five years are 
cancellation of one landbased nuclear weapon the 
multiplewarhead railbased mx missile and scaling back of the 
air forces 70 billion plan for 132 b2 bombers to 13 
spending on the strategic defense initiative would average about 
3 billion a year congress recently slashed 11 billion from 
president bushs request of 49 billion for the proposed 
antimissile shield in the budget that took effect oct 1 
one activeduty army division would be cut as would two of the 
14 aircraft carrier battle groups according to kaufmanns plan 
which will be included in a book to be published next month by the 
liberalleaning brookings institution 
kaufmann a professor emeritus at the massachusetts institute of 
technology served as a consultant to former secretaries of defense 
robert s mcnamara of the kennedy and johnson administrations and 
harold brown of the carter administration

a girl who received part of her mothers liver in 
the nations first such livingdonor transplant underwent nearly 
five more hours of surgery today to stop internal bleeding 
hospital officials said 
despite the bleeding doctors predicted success for mondays 
transplant operations on 21monthold alyssa smith and her mother 
teresa specialists say the procedure could relieve a severe 
shortage of organs for children many of whom die while awaiting a 
liver from a cadaver 
during the night alyssas new liver began to bleed a 
complication that occurs in about 30 percent of all liver 
transplants said john easton a spokesman for university of 
chicago medical center 
the youngster was returned to the operating room before dawn 
surgeons needed only a few minutes to stop the bleeding but kept 
alyssa in surgery to make sure there were no more complications 
said dr christoph broelsch 
shes doing quite well and is stable for now things are back 
on a smooth course said broelsch who led the surgical team in 
the first liver transplant from a living donor in this country 
both mother and daughter had been in critical condition after 
mondays 14hour dual operations mrs smiths condition was 
upgraded to fair alyssa was listed in critical but stable 
condition after this mornings surgery 
mondays procedure was complicated when mrs smiths spleen was 
damaged and had to be removed but doctors predicted she would 
recover fully 
broelsch who pioneered the technique for using segments of 
donor livers in 1984 while at the university of hanover in germany 
said doctors will know in a week whether alyssas body is rejecting 
the liver 
but he said were quite confident that this organ will work 
previously the only regularly performed livingdonor 
transplants have involved kidneys and pancreas segments 
liver transplants from living donors have been performed three 
times in brazil australia and japan all three operations were 
carried out in emergency situations and one child died 
mondays operation was the first of 20 livedonor liver 
transplants authorized by the chicago hospital to determine if the 
procedure is viable the operations will be done on patients who 
have no alternative said dr peter whitington director of 
pediatric transplant services 
we dont think this will be the treatment of choice for every 
patient said broelsch noting the hospital had been 
transplanting portions of livers from cadavers into children since 
1984 with better than 80 percent success 
in the united states half the estimated 700 babies who need 
liver transplants each year die for lack of a donor 
if this procedure works as well as we hope it will it will be 
a significant breakthrough said dr walter andrews director of 
the pediatric transplant program at the university of texas 
southwestern medical center in dallas 
within hours of mondays operation the childrens liver 
foundation in sherman oaks calif was swamped with calls from 
parents about the procedure 
alyssa suffers from an oftenfatal liver disorder called biliary 
atresia the leading cause for liver transplants involving 
children she had been waiting more than a year for a transplant 
surgeons removed the left lobe of mrs smiths liver or about 
onethird of the organ the most tense moments came when mrs 
smiths spleen was accidentally damaged broelsch said 
we didnt expect that at all but we had it under control in 
two or three minutes he said in no way at any point was the 
mothers life in danger 
people can live without the spleen an organ that modifies the 
structure of blood but this may make them more susceptible to 
infection hospital spokesman ed ernst said 
john l smith said he hoped his daughter and his wife a 
29yearold school teacher could be home in schertz texas for 
christmas 
im doing fine now that i know my wife is ok and my daughter 
last i heard is doing great said smith an assistant shipping 
supervisor who was at the hospital with the couples 3yearold 
son richard

armed state officials had no right to set 
up a riverblock to stop and search people canoeing on the saco 
river maines supreme court ruled tuesday 
agents from the department of public safety and the department 
of inland fisheries and wildlife set up the riverblocks on three 
weekends in 1988 to try to stop rowdy and illegal conduct on the 
popular river in southern maine 
but the supreme court justices agreed unanimously with a lower 
court judge who said the searches violated both the federal and 
state constitutions 
the ruling came in a lawsuit filed by daniel and jarlene 
hatfield of rochester nh who were stopped at a riverblock on 
may 28 1988 and subjected to an extensive search in which the 
state agents even looked inside daniel hatfields shorts the 
couple had only three cans of beer and no illegal drugs the 
justices said 
hatfield said he supports law enforcement on the river as long 
as authorities stop only people who give them a reason 
there are things that should be stopped such as excessive 
drinking and scuffles he said 
the state acknowledged that the hatfield search was 
unconstitutional because of a lack of probable cause but said such 
incidents were nothing more than isolated incidents or 
departures from normal appropriate procedures 
but kennebec county superior court justice donald alexander 
refused to dismiss the hatfield search as an isolated incident and 
issued a declaratory judgment that the riverblocks were illegal 
the state appealed leading to tuesdays ruling 
hatfield said tuesday he supports law enforcement on the river 
as long as authorities stop only people who give them a reason 
what made me decide to go through with this when they 
searched my pants that was uncool hatfield said he pulled my 
pants open and looked down inside there wasnt much i could do 
there was no reason for them to search us 
fish and game commissioner william vail said he had not yet seen 
the ruling so he does not know how it will affect future law 
enforcement on the saco which he said has more canoeists than any 
other river in the region and presents a challenge to police 
because no highways run parallel 
we patrolled the river in 1989 without the riverblocks and i 
think we were quite successful vail said i think we certainly 
maintained a law enforcement presence on the river this year 
at each of the 1988 riverblock checkpoints six to 10 armed 
officers and one or two police dogs were stationed on the banks of 
the saco canoeists who were stopped were asked to show their 
fishing licenses and asked if they had any drugs or alcohol 
some officers informed canoeists that they would not be 
prosecuted if they voluntarily surrendered any contraband but 
would be placed under immediate arrest if they did not voluntarily 
surrender any illegal contraband and such contraband was discovered 
in the course of a subsequent search the justices noted 
it was also routine procedure for the officers to inquire 
whether they had any alcohol aboard their canoes and if so to 
identify the state in which they purchased such alcohol the canoes 
and containers in the canoes of any canoeist who admitted to having 
outofstate alcohol but who was uncertain of the amount was 
searched 
each riverblock detected between 20 and 50 violations most of 
them being importation of too much beer fishing without a license 
or possession of marijuana a civil violation the ruling said

a prominent soviet legislator told a 
congressional panel tuesday that after 70 years of trying to 
teach others how to live the kremlin is studying the lessons of 
american democracy 
fyodor m burlatsky the legislator was the first soviet to 
testify before the commission on security and cooperation in 
europe a joint congressionalexecutive branch panel that has 
traded shots with the kremlin over human rights since 1976 
burlatsky came to washington at the head of a sevenperson 
delegation to study the us government meeting with members of 
congress attorney general dick thornburgh the chief justice of 
the united states william h rehnquist and others 
one aim of the delegation is to study nongovernmental 
institutions for protecting human rights such as the american 
civil liberties union said the chairmen of the us panel sen 
dennis deconcini dariz and rep steny hoyer dmd the 
assistant secretary of state for human rights richard schifter 
also sits on the american panel and attended the session 
burlatsky said that soviet lawmakers were watching the examples 
of poland hungary and east germany in reducing the influence of 
the communist party and in moving from an authoritarian society 
to a democratic one 
during 70 years of trying to teach others how to live and what 
systems to build now we have learned that there are things we need 
to learn not only in the realm of technology but also in the 
fields of government and human rights he said referring to seven 
decades of communist rule in russia 
our main aim in coming here is to study your experience to 
find new forms of government he said 
burlatsky first rose to prominence as a speech writer for soviet 
leader nikita s khrushchev who was toppled from power in 1964 
since then burlatsky has worked as a journalist and sociologist 
gaining a reputation as a liberal before mikhail s gorbachev rose 
to power in 1985 
he has written speeches for gorbachev and has been an a 
prominent advocate for democratic reforms in the soviet union 
in his testimony tuesday burlatsky said that the soviet 
parliament known as the supreme soviet was expected to enact by 
january a longawaited law codifying recent liberalization of 
emigration laws 
president bush has said that passage of that law would clear the 
way for him to grant the soviet union mostfavorednation trading 
status lowering tariffs on soviet imports into this country 
burlasky chairman of the subcommittee on humanitarian 
scientific and cultural cooperation of the international affairs 
committee of the supreme soviet said his panel had played a key 
role in drafting the new emigration law ensuring that every soviet 
citizen has the right to leave and return to the soviet union 
the law will be a giant step forward in forming an open 
society in our country he said 
burlatsky read a catalogue of human rights legislation drafted 
by parliament including a law on private property a law on 
freedom of the press a law on freedom of conscience and religion 
and a bill on public organizations

the vatican on tuesday suggested establishing 
permanent ties with the kremlin on the eve of the first visit by a 
soviet leader 
president mikhail s gorbachev arrives wednesday for a state 
visit before meeting with pope john paul ii on friday and then 
flying on to malta for his summit meeting with president bush 
although overshadowed by the events immediately following them 
the soviet leaders talks in italy with president francesco cossiga 
and premier giulio andreotti are expected to focus on the dramatic 
changes in eastern europe where czechoslovakia has joined east 
germany poland hungary and bulgaria in breaking away from 
hardline communism 
at the same time the soviet unions flagging economy has failed 
to respond to gorbachevs attempts at reform and an italian 
government spokesman said italy would like to help the soviet 
union overcome this embarrassing situation the spokesman pio 
mastrobuoni noted that more than a dozen accords are to be signed 
during the visit 
a top vatican official said the pope plans to ask gorbachev to 
forge permanent ties between the kremlin and the holy see which 
has had occasional contacts since the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
after the communists came to power they tried to abolish 
religion but succeeded only in forcing several sects including 4 
million ukrainian catholics underground 
gorbachevs meeting with the polishborn pontiff will be the 
first between a leader of the worlds roman catholics and a soviet 
communist party chief 
the last supreme russian leader to visit the vatican was czar 
nicholas i in 1845 and no soviet party chief has ever visited 
italy 
the holy see is asking for the possibility of a type of 
permanent stable relationship said vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro indicating the issue would be among the top items on the 
agenda for the private talks between gorbachev and the pontiff 
soviet government spokesman gennady i gerasimov welcomed the 
thaw in vaticankremlin relations but did not comment specifically 
on a possible exchange of envoys or other formal arrangement for 
continuing the dialogue 
in a statement signaling the kremlins desire for a 
rapprochement gerasimov said christian values are human values 
and they are the same as socialist values 
navarro said it was premature to discuss what form continuing 
relations might take but he noted the united states was 
represented at the vatican by a personal envoy of the president 
before formal diplomatic relations were established in 1983 
also on tuesday the giant fiat automobile company announced the 
signing of a joint venture to produce 300000 cars annually in the 
soviet union where consumers wait years to purchase an automobile 
nikolai a pugin the soviet minister for the automobile 
industry said fiat was selected as an old friend to be the 
western partner in the ambitious project that envisions selling a 
third of its products for export 
in 1966 fiat built a plant for the soviets that is still 
producing the zhiguli and lada models that are the core of the 
soviet civilian and export fleet the cars have changed little in 
design over the years but enjoy a reputation as being more reliable 
than the volga and moskvich models made in other state factories 
cesare romiti the managing director of fiat spa said the new 
plant to be built in yelabuga southeast of moscow would produce 
small cars similar to the fiat panda the first cars are expected 
to roll off the assembly line in 1993 or 1994 
the panda sells for the equivalent of 5280 to 6350 in italy 
and sovietbuilt models sold for export would have to compete in 
the same market but twothirds of the new cars are to be sold in 
the soviet union for rubles at prices to be determined by the 
soviets romiti said 
because the ruble is not a convertible currency and has little 
value outside the soviet union fiats profits from the venture 
at least in the immediate future must come from exports 
this is an act of faith in a new market which will develop 
with new rules romiti said he added gorbachev will sign an 
agreement thursday that will lay out guarantees for prospective 
italian investors in the soviet union he said the jointventure 
agreement with the soviets also provides for fiat to take its 
profits out of the country a sticking point in earlier business 
talks 
fiat will retain only 30 percent control of the new venture 
with the soviets holding 70 percent but management of the new firm 
wont necessarily be proportional

a colombian jetliner lost cabin pressure 
before it was destroyed by an explosion and the 107 people aboard 
had time to don oxygen masks before they were killed investigators 
said today 
authorities were skeptical of claims that terrorists had caused 
the explosion but said they had not determined how the 26yearold 
plane was destroyed on monday 
the explosion might have been caused by depressurization or by 
other causes said col jorge aurelio gonzalez director of 
colombias civil aviation operations a depressurization made 
the use of oxygen masks necessary 
the boeing 727100 took off monday at 713 am from bogota for 
cali a colombian city 200 miles to the west it crashed seven 
minutes later enveloped in flames 
hundreds of witnesses saw the jet disintegrate in midair and 
many said there were two explosions with flames and smoke pouring 
from the plane 
investigators today worked at the hilly site just south of 
bogota where the avianca airlines jet crashed pieces of the plane 
were found up to six miles from the main point of impact police 
said 
earlier gonzalez said investigators believed that pilots did 
not have enough time to report the explosion to ground controllers 
the plane had been climbing at 4600 feet above the valley 
given the circumstances of the crash i would say that it was 
a terrorist attack a spokesman for colombias pilots association 
said in an interview he spoke on condition of anonymity 
hours after the crash a caller to the caracol radio network 
said the extraditables a terrorist group linked to the medellin 
cocaine cartel had blown up the plane in order to kill six police 
informants aboard 
the caller said the informants had told police the location of 
the jungle hideout of cocaine trafficker pablo escobar 
police on nov 22 raided the camp 70 miles east of medellin but 
escobar and another cartel leader jorge luis ochoa narrowly 
escaped capture 
there was no way to check the authenticity of the call col 
gustavo leal of the national police said a terrorist attack could 
not be ruled out 
i dont believe this accident was caused by terrorists 
civil aviation director yezid castano said today but he admitted 
what happened to the plane has no explanation 
daniel eramian a us justice department spokesman in 
washington said dea investigators have discounted the telephone 
callers claim as bogus 
castano told radio caracol the plane was in perfect condition 
mechanically and had been subjected to all examinations recommended 
by the manufacturer according to maintenance records 
gonzalez said investigators had found no traces of dynamite or 
other explosives 
he said reported indications of metal fatigue were being checked 
out the plane had made 59139 landings in 46000 hours of flight 
time a notebook carried by the crew said a 3inch crack in the 
fuselage had been found on nov 24 according to the newspaper el 
tiempo 
colombian officials said they would send the flight recorder to 
the united states where investigators from the seattlebased 
boeing co and the federal aviation administration would examine it 
late monday authorities finished recovering the bodies of six 
crew members and 101 passengers many found strewn along the 
hillside only 16 of the victims had been identified 
at least one us citizen andres escabi was among the victims 
a us embassy spokesman said escabi born in puerto rico also 
held colombian citizenship and lived in bogota the spokesman said 
police at the crash site said 120 people had been arrested for 
looting the bodies suitcases packages and mail several of the 
looters were caught removing rings and gold chains from the 
corpses police said 
the government of president virgilio barco declared war on drug 
traffickers in august and since then there have been nearly 200 
bombings and other attacks that killed 29 people and wounded 236 
none was on as large scale as mondays plane crash 
the extraditables takes it name from the us justice 
departments list of 12 colombian drug suspects most wanted in the 
united states escobar the reputed head of the medellin cartel 
tops the list 
the last major passenger jet crash in colombia occurred march 
17 1988 when an avianca boeing 727100 crashed into a mountain 
near the northern city of zulia killing 138 people

taking liver segments from healthy adults and 
putting them into dying children can ease a critical shortage but 
the gains cannot be justified if they come at the donors expense 
surgeons said tuesday 
the major thing is whats the risk to the donor said dr 
barry kahan president of the american society of transplant 
surgeons and director of transplantation at the university of texas 
at houston who was monitoring the nations first livingdonor 
liver transplant 
before theres a wide application of this one would like to 
get an estimate of the hazard to the donor certainly a high 
mortality rate in the donor would not give one much enthusiasm for 
continuing this kahan said tuesday 
surgeons at the university of chicago medical center on monday 
became the first in the country to perform a livingdonor liver 
transplant 
teresa smith 29 a teacher from schertz texas had about a 
third of her liver removed and placed into her 21monthold 
daughter alyssa who had been waiting more than a year for a liver 
from a braindead donor 
doctors who performed the dual operations predicted success for 
alyssa despite additional surgery tuesday to stop internal 
bleeding expectations also were high for mrs smith whose spleen 
was removed after the organ accidentally was damaged in surgery 
dr robert gordon of the university of pittsburgh the worlds 
leading transplant center said he hopes doctors are a little 
more cautious about jumping into this than they have been in the 
past with other medical advances 
its one thing to just give new medicine gordon said 
its another thing to subject healthy living donors to a 
surgical procedure without giving careful consideration to it if 
you do any harm the negative impact would be enormous 
for kahan a 1 percent mortality rate among donating parents or 
one death in every 100 cases would be acceptable provided the 
child had a 50 percent or more chance of being alive five years 
after surgery 
the mortality rate for people donating one of their two kidneys 
to ill relatives is about 01 percent or one death in every 1000 
cases according to kahan 
liver donation is a much trickier operation he said and 
of course the delayed complications can be appreciably greater 
despite the uncertainties transplant specialists around the 
country are hopeful the chicago operation could turn around the 
excruciating lack of livers for preschool children 
of the 749 people awaiting liver transplants in the united 
states on monday 156 were younger than age 6 according to dr 
william vaughn director of research for the united network for 
organ sharing most like alyssa suffer from biliary atresia a 
fatal blockage of the bile ducts 
experience shows as many as half the 156 children will die 
waiting according to dr john najarian chairman of the university 
of minnesotas department of surgery 
appalled by such figures transplant surgeons a few years ago 
began trimming livers from braindead adults to fit into toddlers 
doctors then started splitting livers and transplanting each half 
into a young patient 
the procedures were possible because of the unique regenerative 
ability of the liver additionally livers unlike kidneys do not 
require a tissue match between the donor and recipient 
doctors on occasion have removed about a third of a healthy 
persons pancreas and transplanted it into a diabetic relative so 
far there have been no major complications according to najarian 
whose team has performed more than 70 of the procedures 
a positive part of donors who are relatives is that the 
transplanted organ tends to be a closer genetic match than one 
procured from a dead stranger according to najarian there 
consequently is more likelihood the transplanted organ will work 
the major thrust still has to be getting as many cadaver 
organs as possible and developing better antirejection drugs 
gordon said 
many parents evidently feel the benefits outweigh any risks 
within hours of mondays operation the childrens liver foundation 
in sherman oaks calif was swamped with calls about the procedure 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota questions the soundness of the 
requests 
does informed consent mean anything when youre asking a 
mother to save the life of her dying child he asked what 
choice is there

women who were offered lowcost breast xrays at 
work were willing to undergo the cancerdetection procedure at more 
than double the rate of women in general a radiologist says 
by offering a lowcost program at the worksite we reduced two 
of the most significant barriers expense and inconvenience that 
prevent women from obtaining routine mammographic examinations 
said dr howard b kessler 
in a report monday to the 75th scientific assembly of the 
radiological society of north america kessler said the program 
involved taking a 32foot mobile mammography van to 53 worksites in 
pennsylvania and four in delaware 
mammographic examinations were offered to female employees and 
male employees spouses over age 35 by bell of pennsylvania and 
diamond state bell subsidiaries of bell atlantic corp he said 
women were charged 30 each for the standard twoview 
mammograms with the corporations paying the remaining 30 for each 
procedure said kessler director of breast imaging at the fox 
chase cancer center in philadelphia which ran the program 
during the first year 3627 women more than a third of the 
approximately 10000 eligible received mammograms at the 
worksite he said 
from that group 63 biopsies were recommended of those nine 
cancers were identified all in early stages about the same 
prevalence that occurs statewide for the disease kessler reported 
i believe nationally about 15 percent to 20 percent of women 
in ageeligible populations seek out a screening examination 
kessler said 
breast cancer killed 40354 us women in 1986 the last year 
for which figures are available a least 19 percent of the deaths 
could have been prevented with recommended mammograms federal 
researchers have estimated 
doctors agree that women should get mammograms according to the 
following timetable kessler said an initial breast xray between 
the ages of 35 and 39 subsequent breast xrays every two years 
from ages 40 to 49 and annually after that 
no figures were available on how many companies provide 
breastscreening at work nationwide but its rare said kessler 
part of the success of the program outlined by kessler was due 
to the companies commitment to promote and support mammography he 
said 
also results of the screenings went to the womens private 
physicians rather than to their employers so privacy was assured 
kessler said 
while many employeeinsurance plans may cover the costs of 
mammograms if they are used in the process of making a diagnosis 
such as by ruling out a suspicious physical sign few plans cover 
them as routine screening procedures he said

the us trade deficit after improving for 
six months deteriorated slightly to 2775 billion in the third 
quarter fed by americas appetite for imported goods and by flat 
exports the government reported tuesday 
analysts do not see much improvement in the near future imports 
may drop somewhat because of a slowing us economy they say but 
exports also are likely to fall because of a strong dollar and 
moderating economies overseas 
the commerce department said the gap between imports and us 
exports edged up 07 percent in the julyseptember quarter from the 
second quarters 2755 billion the apriljune gap deficit was the 
narrowest since a 277 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 
1985 
imports posted a 03 percent gain to a record 1193 billion 
while exports rose only 02 percent to 916 billion also a 
record both imports and exports have reached record levels during 
each of the last five quarters 
but analysts worry that exports which sustained much of the 
us economy last year will remain unchanged in the months ahead 
the trade report substantiates what weve already seen 
export growth simply has flattened out after booming previously and 
is a major source of the wave of weakness rippling through the us 
economy particularly the manufacturing sector commented allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co 
samuel d kahan chief financial economist for kleinwort benson 
government securities inc in chicago agreed that the pace of 
exports is probably coming to the end of its run due to the 
dollar 
a stronger dollar makes us goods more expensive and thus less 
competitive overseas while making imported goods cheaper and thus 
more attractive to american buyers 
kahan also suggested that as the british economy slows 
which seems likely and some of the other industrial countries 
particuarly japan moderate their economic activity that should 
hurt our exports 
sinai also said that as the us economy weakens more as will 
probably be the case over the next few quarters imports too will 
probably decline 
but lawrence chimerine senior economic advisor for the wefa 
group in bala cynwyd pa pointed to the high level of oil 
imports which he said will continue and further aggravate the 
trade deficit 
the commerce department said the average number of barrels 
imported daily increased 85 percent to 865 million barrels in the 
third quarter the highest level since the third quarter of 1977 
but despite the increase oil imports showed a julyseptember 
numerical decrease of 1 percent because of lower prices the 
average price per barrel fell from 1846 to 1685 
nonoil imports rose 05 percent to 106 billion led by 
consumer goods including clothing and household goods imports of 
industrial supplies and materials fell while both capital goods and 
automotive products were virtually unchanged 
nonfarm exports increased 2 percent to a record 818 billion 
the sector was boosted by shipments of capital goods including 
aircraft and parts to western europe japan and newly 
industrialized countries in the far east 
shipments of nonfarm products such as industrial supplies and 
materials and automotive parts fell farm products also fell down 
10 percent to 98 billion 
for the first nine months of the year the overall deficit was 
running at an annual rate of 1116 billion down 123 percent from 
the 1272 billion trade gap registered in all of 1988 
todays report on merchandise trade which is calculated on a 
balance of payment basis is slightly different from the commerce 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports because it excludes 
us military sales to foreign governments and makes other minor 
adjustments in the monthly figures

a centrist opposition alliance moved 
tuesday to form indias first minority government since 
independence but divisions began to surface among potentional 
supporters 
the congress party of prime minister rajiv gandhi could 
conceivably try to form a coalition but it said it will become the 
opposition as the national front attempts to form a government 
the congress party which has led the government for all but 2 
years since india gained independence from britain in 1947 won 
more parliamentary seats than any single party in elections that 
ended sunday but it fell far short of a majority 
that is the verdict of the people said party spokesman 
anand sharma 
we sat in the opposition once before and we can do it again 
said arjun singh a powerful congress party boss referring to the 
1977 election loss after 29 turbulent months that government fell 
apart and congress returned to power 
the centrist national front alliance expressed confidence it 
could form the next government 
the people of india want a noncongress government to replace 
the corrupt and inefficient congress government it is therefore 
the sacred duty of the national front to respect this mandate 
the national front said in a statement read by its chief spokesman 
dinesh goswamy 
the national front said its new parliament members would meet 
wednesday to select their choice for prime minister among the 
leading candidates were three former congress members vishwanath 
pratap singh ramakrishna hegde and chandra shekhar 
the fronts strategy is to opt for a minority government with 
the tacit support of an array of parties ranging from the 
communists to hindu fundamentalists 
opposition parties have been plagued by highly publicized 
internal feuds but they set aside their differences several months 
ago to unite and oust gandhis government alleging corruption and 
ineptitude 
differences among the parties started to emerge tuesday when the 
rightwing india peoples party said it would not support any 
government that included communist parties 
with 473 of the 525 seats declared the congress party and its 
allies had 202 seats according to staterun tv gandhi was ahead 
in his own race for reelection to parliament leading by more than 
135000 votes over opponent raj mohan gandhi the grandson of 
indias beloved independence leader mohandas k gandhi 
the national front had 115 seats and the indian peoples party 
81 the communist and leftist parties had 44 
together those seats would give the national front and its 
allies 240 spots but the front could be hardpressed to preserve 
such an ideologically diverse group 
the remaining seats were held by smaller regional parties and 
independent candidates the winners included the father and the 
widow of beant singh one of the gunmen who killed gandhis mother 
and predecessor indira gandhi and the man suspected of 
masterminding her assassination 
seating of a new government began monday night when president 
ramaswamy venkataraman dissolved parliament 
the president normally would ask the party with the most seats 
to try to form a government but the constitution does not 
specifically require this 
rather than rush into a coalition attempt of his own however 
gandhi appeared willing to wait to see whether the national front 
would founder in its efforts 
the alliance if any will be illmatched and bound to result 
in a divorce sooner or later said murlidhar bhandare a congress 
party lawmaker the party was to meet wednesday to elect a 
parliamentary leader that post and party president are separate 
although one person can hold both 
asked if gandhi would offer to resign as party president because 
of the election losses party spokesman sharma said the question 
does not arise all party men have affirmed their full faith in 
gandhis leadership 
gandhi was swept into power in december 1984 on a wave of 
sympathy following the assassination of his mother two months 
earlier 
but support for him declined in the face of allegations of 
government corruption gandhi has denied any wrongdoing

sen edward kennedy on tuesday visited the 
spot of his brothers famous speech denouncing the berlin wall and 
he said the barriers opening will lead to the reunification of 
germany 
he also laid two white lilies on the steps of west berlins 
schoeneberg city hall where president john f kennedy stood on 
june 26 1963 and declared ich bin ein berliner i am a 
berliner 
during a oneday visit the massachsetts democrat also met in 
west berlin with east german opposition groups including new 
forum the west berlin city government said the groups told kennedy 
that reforms in their homeland were being overshadowed by west 
germanled debate on reunification 
i think that is an inevitable course of history kennedy 
said after crossing briefly into east berlin for talks with 
lutheran church leaders the question of timing and the rest 
these are questions that really have to be determined by the people 
in these communities 
kennedy also laid flowers at the reichstag in east berlin in 
tribute to the more than 80 people killed trying to escape after 
east germany built the wall in 1961 
east german border guards stared silently as the senator walked 
alongside the wall and looked at spots where souvenir hunters have 
chipped away pieces of concrete 
east germany bowing to a citizens uprising demanding reforms 
lifted travel restrictions and opened the wall and other borders on 
nov 9 
in a welcoming ceremony at schoeneberg city hall kennedy said 
i come here today on behalf of my family and country on a 
journey of memory and hope 
you have opened the way to a new world of freedom he said 
today in that world of freedom the proudest boast is ich bin 
ein berliner 
he was flanked by former west german chancellor willy brandt 
who as west berlin mayor accompanied president kennedy in 1963 
the peaceful men and women moving by the thousands through 
checkpoint charlie are at the center of the greatest march of 
liberty of modern times and perhaps of all time the senator 
said 
many assumed the concrete could never be breached the stones 
never thrown down the iron curtain never lifted lass sie nach 
berlin kommen let them come to berlin he added echoing his 
brothers words once again 
many west berlin residents remember john f kennedys words 
fondly and the city has honored the slain president with a plaque

the united states has little interest in any 
possible soviet proposal at the malta summit to restrict naval 
power because such a step would hamper americas security and its 
ability to protect its allies the state department said tuesday 
the soviet union a land power would be less constrained by 
such proposals than would the united states said spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler adding we are not aware of naval arms control 
measures that enhance stability 
the comments came as the pentagon reported that the soviets will 
have four warships capable of carrying nuclear weapons in the 
mediterranean during this weekends summit contrary to a report 
that moscow was withdrawing such ships in anticipation of a 
possible initiative to declare the region a nuclearfree zone 
ms tutwiler asked about reports that the soviets might use the 
meeting between president bush and and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to push a new initiative on naval arms control said the 
soviets may seek to make a virtue of necessity by proposing 
constraints related to limitations on their own naval deployments 
the spokeswoman noted that us officials have observed a 
worldwide downturn in sovet naval activity for some time and that 
it apparently is due to operational problems and budget restraints 
ms tutwiler said the united states has no indication that the 
soviets intend to propose any naval cuts at the summit 
she stressed that the united states depends on freedom of the 
seas to protect its security and commercial interests to 
demonstrate its support for its allies and to deter war 
we have opposed soviet proposals for naval arms control 
because they would hamper our ability to honor our commitments to 
our allies and carry out our global responsibility she said 
at the pentagon officials reported that the mediterranean will 
be bristling with us and soviet naval power during the seawater 
summit with four soviet nuclearcapable combat ships and three 
times as many such us vessels in the region 
the soviet union is expected to have four nuclearcapable 
combatants and four auxiliaries in the med during the malta 
meeting spokesman fred hoffman told reporters 
hoffman said the soviet group is expected to include three 
guidedmissile frigates the slava guidedmissile cruiser which 
will be the site of talks on saturday between bush and gorbachev 
and four support vessels 
such ships are normally armed with a variety of missiles 
including the ssn12 antiship cruise missile the san6 air 
defense missile and the ssn14 antisubmarine missile said 
another pentagon spokesman lt cmdr ken satterfield 
the navy is expected to have 25 ships in the mediterranean 
during the summit that includes the aircraft carrier uss forrestal 
and the dozen destroyers cruisers and frigates that compose its 
battle group 
also in the area is an amphibious ready group composed of five 
ships ready to deploy some 2400 marines said a navy spokesman 
cmdr craig quigley 
of the us ships 11 can carry nuclear weapons satterfield 
said 
hoffman asked whether the us ships would be so armed refused 
to say 
we neither confirm nor deny the existence of such weapons 
he said 
a defense official who spoke on condition he not be named said 
the soviets still have a submarine presence in the 
mediterranean and are expected to continue to do so through the 
shipboard summit 
the two leaders are scheduled to share a dinner saturday night 
aboard the us host vessel the uss belknap the guidedmissile 
cruiser that is a command ship for the us sixth fleet in the 
mediterranean

the food and drug administration on tuesday 
approved a new drug that quickly dissolves blood clots to prevent 
permanent damage following a heart attack 
the drug called anistreplase is the third clotdissolving drug 
to be approved 
its advantage is that it can be administered in five minutes or 
less while the other two must be administered continuously for one 
to three hours according to smithkline beecham which will market 
the drug as eminase 
although clotdissolving drugs can open blocked arteries and 
limit damage from heart attacks they are used in only 20 percent 
or so of the estimated 400000 to 600000 patients who could 
benefit from treatment each year according to the department of 
health and human services which includes the fda 
more than 300000 of the 15 million people who suffer heart 
attacks each year die before getting to the hospital and an 
additional 300000 get there too late for treatment with 
clotdissolving drugs the department said in announcing the fda 
action 
ease and convenience of administration of anistreplase 
hopefully will lead to greater use of this lifesaving thrombolytic 
therapy even in emergency rooms and small hospitals not equipped 
with sophisticated coronary care facilities said hhs secretary 
louis sullivan 
a blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is the 
most common cause of heart attacks the clot prevents blood from 
carrying oxygen to the heart muscle which can lead to heart 
failure and death 
the other two approved clotdissolving drugs are alteplase or 
tpa and streptokinase

the soviet parliament tuesday approved a plan that 
apparently gave control of the disputed territory of 
nagornokarabakh back to azerbaijan but it also ordered the 
republic to work closely with the armenian majority in the region 
armenian deputies walked out of the hall when the directive on 
the nagornokarabakh region appeared at a closed legislative 
meeting on the final day of the supreme soviets fall session 
the neighboring republics of azerbaijan and armenia have been 
waging a bloody dispute over the region which is located entirely 
within the borders of moslem azerbaijan but whose population of 
124000 mainly christian armenians outnumber azerbaijanis by a 41 
ratio 
a special kremlin commission was formed in january to get 
control of the region where more than 60 people have died in 
ethnic clashes since february 1988 
the directive that was passed by the legislature eliminated the 
commission which was headed by arkady volsky 
nobody wanted to talk about it no one understood it said 
zuri balayan an ethnic armenian from nagornokarabakh in a 
telephone interview he was one of the deputies who walked out of 
the hall 
nevertheless it passed by a wide margin balayan said more than 
350 deputies voted for it only four voted against it and 20 
abstained 
asked what the likely effect of the directive will be balayan 
said only well wait and see 
the dispute has been one of the sources of continuous tension 
between the two caucasus republics in the southern part of the 
soviet union and despite the presence of soldiers some reports 
have warned of a virtual state of civil war some officials have 
compared the unrest in the region to that in lebanon 
the directive distributed by the tass news agency ordered the 
azerbaijan government in the shortest period of time to approve 
legislative measures guaranteeing the heightening of the status of 
real autonomy working guarantees to the armenian population of the 
nagornokarabakh autonomous region observance of the law 
protection of life and safety of citizens constitutional decision 
of all the problems that arise 
it ordered officials in azerbaijan to work with reinstated local 
officials in nagornokarabakh to write a new law guaranteeing the 
region full development in all spheres of government economic 
and culture on the basis of selfmanagement selffinancing 
territorial selfaccounting and freedom of economic and cultural 
ties 
armenians have dominated much of the local government in 
nagornokarabakh which was suspended when direct rule by volsky 
was imposed jan 12 
it was uncertain how the kremlin expected the polarized 
leaderships and population of the area to solve the problem but it 
was clear that officials believed it useless to continue direct 
rule from moscow 
the volsky commission was abolished and replaced by another 
commission under the supervision of the legislature which the 
directive said would oversee the work soldiers of the soviet 
interior ministry will remain in nagornokarabakh and obey the new 
commission the directive said 
the directive did not say who would be in charge of the new 
commission or exactly what its powers would be 
the dispute over nagornokarabakh brought hundreds of thousands 
of people into the streets of cities in both armenia and azerbaijan 
in february 1988 in its first effort to control the tension and 
address armenia charges of intention azerbaijani neglect the 
kremlin approved a multimillionruble plan to improve cultural and 
economic conditions 
local officials were ordered in the supreme soviet directive to 
ensure that no one tries to move settlers into nagornokarabakh to 
change the demographic patterns a special commission was set up to 
deal with the thousands of refugees who have fled violence in the 
area

antinuclear activists from 
greenpeace usa will try to halt the launch of a trident 2 missile 
from a submarine off the florida coast which they said is 
scheduled friday a spokeswoman said tuesday 
coming on the eve of the mediterranean summit this test is a 
slap in the face to the worlds hopes and expectations for 
meaningful arms reductions said greenpeace spokeswoman shannon 
fagan 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev meet 
saturday and sunday off the island of malta in the mediterranean 
the navy refused to confirm or deny that it planned a trident 2 
launch friday 
greenpeace was successful in stopping a trident 2 test from the 
nuclear submarine tennessee last july 28 maneuvering small zodiac 
rafts close enough to the sub to attach nuclear free seas flags 
to its hull and mast 
the antinuclear activists left the area declaring they had 
made their point that the trident 2 should be eliminated as a 
weapons system and the navy was able to launch the missile five 
days later 
that was the only success in three submarine testlaunches the 
other two ended in explosions just seconds after the missiles 
cleared the ocean surface 
in washington a government source said the bush administration 
might delay the test until after the summit discussions are 
going on as to whether to delay it until after malta said one 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the trident 2 at 265 million a copy is designed to replace 
the trident 1 submarinelaunched ballistic missiles each 
44footlong threestage trident 2 can deliver as many as 12 
nuclear warheads to individual targets up to 6000 miles away

the white gold and red flag atop hradcany castle 
indicates the president is in town 
but since a peaceful countrywide revolt against communist rule 
no word has been heard from the head of a state that is swept by 
crisis 
at 76 gustav husak must be a bitter man in the sprawling castle 
that dominates prague and was the seat of an empire 600 years ago 
he was stripped of his seat in the communist partys ruling 
politburo on friday he has been the target of derisive jeers from 
hundreds of thousands and he must be aware of growing popular 
demands that the man he once called a traitor replace him 
the name most often chanted by demonstrators as their favorite 
to succeed him is that of alexander dubcek the bestknown figure 
in the shortlived prague spring of 1968 that was turned into 
winter by a moscowled invasion 
husak himself a onetime victim of stalinist purges in the 
1950s returned from oblivion in 1968 rising to the post deputy 
premier 
but he steered a cautious middle course between dubceks 
reformers and the conservative elements in the party such tactics 
were rewarded by leonid i brezhnev the soviet leader who had 
ordered the invasion 
unlike dubcek and his closest associates husak never was 
summoned to moscow following the invasion and he missed allegedly 
for lack of transport and communications taking part in an 
emergency communist party congress that branded the invasion 
illegal 
only once does he seem to have been carried away by the wave of 
nationalism in the country after the soviet tanks rolled into 
prague i stand and fall with dubcek he stated words cited 
ever since by his critics 
dubcek was allowed by the soviets to hang on until april 1969 
but then husak replaced him as party chief in 1975 he became 
president of czechoslovakia as well capping an ambitionfilled 
career 
since then husak was twice reelected with his third term due 
to end in june 1990 
after dubcek whom he had expelled from the party in 1970 
criticized the new leadership husak publicly denounced him as a 
traitor of communism and czechoslovakia 
dubcek was never arrested or charged some credit husak for 
that saying he recalled the nine years he spent in jail on 
political charges 
for many years dubcek remained in seclusion employed by the 
forestry service in slovakia the native state of both himself and 
husak but last week he rose from oblivion addressing giant 
prodemocracy demonstrations in prague where hundreds of thousands 
chanted his name 
dubcek to the castle they shouted another slogan 
addressed to gustav husak was gustl look what a big crowd we 
are 
dubcek had nothing new to say said martin palous a member 
of the civic forum opposition group it was just the old jargon 
when he spoke but as president he would be an important symbolic 
link between the past and the future 
on the vast but almost empty square in front of hradcany 
castle groups of soviet and yugoslav tourists were told of the

a greek cargo ship that ran aground and 
spewed more than 237000 gallons of fuel and oil into the bering 
sea will remain there until spring because it is too dangerous to 
move it 
until then no attempt will be made to remove the 140000 gallons 
of oil still in the ships tanks despite the threat of more 
leakage if winter storms and icing further damage the ship 
officials said monday 
coast guard capt richard asaro the federal cleanup 
coordinator also said no spill cleanup or rescue of oiled birds 
will be attempted the remote location temperatures in the low 
20s strong winds and seas swelling eight to 15 feet make such 
efforts too dangerous he said 
on sunday a diver surveying damage to the ships hull was 
trapped briefly in a depression on the sea floor when the 485foot 
milos reefer rolled to one side asaro said about five minutes 
later however the ship rolled to the other side and freed diver 
john whitekettle who was unhurt asaro said 
asaro said the two coast guard vessels at the site will remain 
just long enough for officials to complete their survey 
the ship ran aground nov 14 on a reef off st matthew island in 
the bering sea national wildlife refuge 400 miles west of bethel 
the cause of the grounding remains under investigation 
the weather improved enough during the weekend to allow 
officials to board the ship and determine how much oil remained 
asaro said that of 237343 gallons that leaked about 170000 
was intermediate fuel oil and the rest was diesel environmental 
officials are most concerned about the fuel oil which has the 
consistency of molasses 
bruce erickson western alaska supervisor for the state 
department of environmental quality said the fuel oil is washing 
up on beaches and poses a threat to marine life including the 
areas blue crab population 
most of what remains on board the ship is fuel oil about 
112000 gallons the rest about 29000 gallons are various 
lubrication oils used to run the ship asaro said 
there is still some occasional leakage he said were 
talking a sheen as distinct from slicks 
erickson said a coat of oil 20 feet wide and four to five inches 
deep is spread along about a mile of the island beach four oiled 
bird carcasses were found on the beach while sea lions and a fox 
seen on the island appeared unaffected he said overall there 
appeared to be little wildlife in the area 
pack ice which forms over that area of the bering sea by 
midjanuary could move and further damage the ship trapping any 
additional oil that leaks that would pose a lingering threat to 
the islands birds most of which probably will return in the 
spring before the ice melts erickson said

the editor of an unofficial siberian journal was 
sentenced to three years in a labor camp tuesday activists said 
in a case that has drawn the attention of andrei d sakharov and 
other human rights campaigners 
sergei kuznetsov was found guilty of slandering a local interior 
ministry official and resisting arrest in the siberian city of 
sverdlovsk said andrei mironov a moscowbased journalist and 
human rights activist 
human rights activists say the charges were trumped up to 
silence kuznetsov 32 
he is editor of his own unofficial journal as well as a 
contributor to some of the bestknown nonofficial publications 
that have sprung up in moscow in the freer atmosphere of president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
mironov said the trial showed that despite gorbachevs reforms 
that freed hundreds of political prisoners the system of 
repression has been preserved 
kuznetsov attended his trial lying down because of a prolonged 
hunger strike against the accusations mironov said 
several weeks ago moscow activists quoted kuznetsovs lawyer as 
saying the editor had been pushed down a flight of stairs at the 
sverdlovsk courthouse by police after a court hearing 
sakharov and other human rights activists issued a protest after 
that and mironov on tuesday quoted the 1975 nobel peace prize 
winner as saying he could not support an international human rights 
conference in the soviet union in 1991 if kuznetsov was imprisoned

authorities plan to cut down a 
150yearold cottonwood tree in hopes of finding a bullet that 
might shed light on an unsolved double murder 33 years ago 
cascade county sheriff barry michelotti said investigators hope 
to find the bullet that killed 18yearold lloyd bogle whose body 
was found near the tree on jan 3 1956 along a dirt road that was 
a lovers lane of the era 
the body of his 16yearold girlfriend patricia kalitzke was 
found the next day seven miles away 
both had been shot in the head and the bullet that killed bogle 
was missing 
the tree has always been of major interest to law 
enforcement officers because thats where he was killed right at 
the tree michelotti said 
michelotti said police are cutting down the tree now because 
they had talked about it for years and finally decided to do it 
recovery of the bullet would enable authorities to determine the 
caliber of the murder weapon the sheriff said there even is a 
possibility the bullet could be matched with a weapon seized 
sometime over the last 33 years in another crime 
efforts to xray the tree failed because of its size and 
density said sgt dick duncan an investigator on the case 
the sheriff said the tree 80 feet tall with a trunk 4 feet 
in diameter will be cut down and 33 growth rings will be shaved 
off its lower section 
once we hit the 33year mark on the tree we should see an 
entry if the bullet went into the tree a hole a tunnel 
michelotti said

fbi director william s sessions told the 
bureaus employees that random testing for possible use of illegal 
drugs may begin early next year the bureau said tuesday 
sessions informed the bureaus 9700 agents and nearly 13000 
support personnel of the random testing program in a notice dated 
nov 14 said fbi spokesman mike kortan 
the random testing is expected to begin sometime after jan 14 
kortan said 
under the plan a computer program will be used to randomly 
select the names of employees who will be required to undergo urine 
testing to determine if they have used illegal drugs kortan said 
employees who test positive for illegal drug use could be 
suspended or dismissed from their jobs but each case would be 
evaluated individually in the context of all the circumstances 
kortan said 
refusal to provide a urine sample would also result in 
disciplinary action that could include dismissal he said 
the random testing at the fbi is being started under a 1986 
executive order by president reagan to kick off his initiative for 
a drugfree workplace 
a number of federal agencies have instituted similar programs 
which have met with mixed reviews in court decisions resulting from 
lawsuits filed by affected employees 
the justice department is seeking supreme court review of an 
appellate court decision that restricted testing of career lawyers 
in washington to those with access to topsecret information those 
lawyers in turn have asked the high court to review the same 
decision by the us circuit court of appeals here 
so far no justice department attorney has been tested under the 
program unveiled in 1988 but the department recently began testing 
job applicants said department spokeswoman amy brown 
since 1986 the bureau has tested fbi job applicants for drug 
use in 1987 the bureau began testing new agents during their 
oneyear probationary period kortan said 
in addition the bureau tests volunteers as well as employees 
suspected of illegal drug use 
as of nov 21 9540 employees or applicants were tested and 
only 34 showed evidence of drug use koran said figures on the 
number of employees dismissed as a result of positive tests were 
not available kortan said 
sessions also announced that he had established a program to 
assist all employees with substance abuse kortan said

a federal judge tuesday denied a request by 
presidential assailant john hinckley to be interviewed by news 
organizations saying hinckleys mental illness could worsen with 
public exposure 
us district court judge june green rejected hinckleys request 
for up to two interviews per month with the news media starting 
with abctv and the washington post 
a directive at st elizabeths hospital in washington prohibiting 
personal interviews between maximumsecurity patients and the news 
media embodies a reasonable and constitutionally valid approach 
with regard to hinckley said the judge 
the directive the judge noted permits patients to correspond 
with reporters by mail hinckley has done so in the past 
hinckley found not guilty by reason of insanity in the march 
1981 assassination attempt on thenpresident reagan has been a 
patient at st elizabeths since august 1982 three months ago he 
filed a motion saying his first amendment right of free speech was 
being violated 
the judge said that testimony by dr raymond patterson a 
forensic psychiatrist established that hinckleys personality is 
particularly vulnerable to reinforcement through media contact 
resulting in exacerbation of his illness generally 
hinckleys attorney mark lane said he would consult with his 
client on wednesday before deciding whether to appeal 
the us government is continuing to prevent mr hinckley from 
telling the american people what he knows about events of national 
importance said lane 
the events include the total lack of presidential security 
the ease with which he secured a weapon to shoot the president and 
the fact that he was a victim of legal drugs prescribed regularly 
for him by a psychiatrist before the assassination attempt said 
the lawyer 
i understand that many people have difficulty with the concept 
that mr hinckley was acquitted that he was found not guilty 
said lane it is disturbing to find that a us district court 
judge also has difficulty understanding that concept 
at a court hearing in september patterson testified that 
hinckley suffers from narcissistic personality disorder and that 
approving hinckleys request for personal interviews with the media 
would be harmful to his therapy 
hinckley said after his arrest that he attempted the 
assassination in an effort to attract actress jodie foster 
he shows continued intense interest in the actress the 
judge said letters written by mr hinckley and articles 
recovered from his room reflect mr hinckleys habit of 
retaining dozens of photographs of ms foster some nude and 
regularly seeking more of them she said 
hinckley described himself in a 1986 letter as the successor 
to hitler and linked hitler to mass murderer charles manson 
hinckley called manson one cool dude in a 1988 letter 
white house press secretary james brady was left partially 
paralyzed in the 1981 shootings in which a secret service agent 
and washington police officer were wounded as well as the president

jurors in the 2yearold mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial returned one verdict under seal tuesday but 
indicated they are deadlocked on one of the 65 molestation counts 
against two defendants 
theyve said only that theyve taken several ballots and 
cannot reach a verdict on a count said superior court judge 
william pounders given the fact there are 65 counts that is not 
too significant 
raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 
are charged with conspiracy and child molestation at their 
familyowned preschool in manhattan beach their trial is the 
longest in us history and has cost los angeles county over 15 
million 
jurors have been deliberating since nov 2 
the judge has instructed the jurors to give him each verdict 
once it is final sealed in an envelope he said he would begin 
reading the verdicts as early as next week even if all 65 charges 
had not been decided 
the jurys predicament came to light when they sent a note to 
the judge asking if a deadlock should be submitted as a sealed 
verdict 
pounders told the jurors they should not seal any nondecision 
you do give us only the final decisions you make the 
unanimous decisions he said 
the panelists then returned to their jury deliberation room and 
within about two minutes they buzzed for the court clerk who 
returned with a single verdict they had given him to seal in an 
envelope 
the unusual process the judge said is warranted by the unique 
nature of the case pounders has been worried that at least one 
juror may drop out of the deliberations before all of the charges 
are resolved since there are no alternates remaining that would 
result in a mistrial on the unresolved matters 
we have an unusual circumstance because we have 65 verdicts to 
take he said taking them one at a time is an insane process 
but waiting for all of them is just as insane because we may lose a 
key juror before that time and thus lose all of those verdicts

a federal jury deliberating 
racketeering charges that remain against three people it acquitted 
of conspiring to overthrow the us government went home tuesday 
without reaching consensus 
attorneys said they didnt know how to interpret the apparent 
deadlock 
the only thing i am sure of is theyll be back at 9 am 
said defense attorney william newman 
while clearing raymond levasseur his wife patricia gros 
levasseur and richard williams of seditious conspiracy charges 
jurors indicated monday that they seriously doubted they could 
reach agreement on the racketeering counts in the yearlong trial 
us district judge william young who monday urged jurors to 
try again made little comment as he sent the jurors tuesday to 
their 20th day of deliberations once they were out of the 
courtroom however he said he would consider a motion for a 
mistrial if the jury remains deadlocked 
young said if the government then requests a new trial it would 
be held in boston and probably would be much shorter 
jurors have cleared mrs levasseur of racketeering and were 
deciding the same charge against the two men as well as a charge of 
racketeering conspiracy against all three each count carries a 
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and 20000 in fines 
prosecutors suggested that a request jurors made tuesday to 
review defense testimony by corporate executives indicated they 
mistakenly believe each act in the indictment has to be proven as 
affecting interstate commerce 
assistant us attorney michael loucks has failed to persuade 
the judge to give the jury a clarification about the federal 
racketeering law it requires proving a criminal enterprise as a 
whole affects interstate commerce which could simply mean that it 
buys goods in more than one state 
the government has maintained that the defendants were part of a 
group operating under the names united freedom front and sam 
melvillejonathan jackson unit that they said took responsibility 
for a string of bombings and bank robberies along the east coast 
from 1976 to 1984 
originally eight people were indicted but only three are left 
in the trial which was moved from boston to springfield 
levasseur and williams already are serving lengthy terms as a 
result of separate trials in some of the bombings patricia 
levasseur is free on bail after serving 3 years of a fiveyear 
term for harboring a fugitive her husband 
the springfield prosecution was intended to pull the case 
together through racketeering laws that allow several people to be 
tried for incidents occurring in several states 
the racketeering charges include 15 successful or attempted 
bombings of courthouses banks corporate offices and military 
recruiting and reserve centers one of the bombings at the suffolk 
county courthouse in boston in april 1976 left one man with his 
leg severed below the knee but some of the other devices failed to 
explode 
of the seven defendants at the time of the initial jury 
selection in march 1988 prosecutors dropped charges against two a 
third pleaded guilty to sedition and other charges and charges 
were dropped against a fourth after a judge suppressed evidence 
seized at her house

gov buddy roemer on tuesday rejected 
the recommendation of the louisiana pardon board and refused to 
halt the execution of a man convicted of killing two men before he 
was 18 
dalton prejean now 30 is to die early thursday for the 1977 
murder of state trooper donald cleveland 
roemer acted shortly after the 5th us circuit court of appeal 
threw out the latest of prejeans numerous appeals rejecting 
among other things claims that he is retarded and a victim of 
racial discrimination 
andrea robinson one of prejeans attorneys said she would go 
to the us supreme court which has twice refused to hear his 
appeals 
the pardon board voted 32 monday to recommend reducing the 
death sentence to life in prison for prejean who killed cleveland 
six months after being released from a juvenile institution where 
he was sent at age 14 for the murder of a taxi driver 
the majority of the board voted for clemency based on testimony 
that prejean had been abused as a child that he probably suffered 
some brain damage as a child that he had a good prison record and 
showed remorse board chairwoman yvonne foreman said 
roemer said he talked with defense attorneys and witnesses and 
studied the decision of the pardon board 
with a handgun he shot three times a state trooper in the 
chest and face and killed him roemer said at a news conference 
it was not his first murder 
roemer noted the background of abuse as a child and reduced 
intelligence but added that standards of age of intelligence 
meet those standards set forth by the us supreme court 
and finally i would say there is a special circumstance in my 
position to have a state trooper in the line of duty in uniform to 
be brutally and maliciously murdered 
prejean and his brother had been drinking left a bar in their 
car and were stopped by cleveland prejean said the trooper 
manhandled his brother and that he feared for his brothers life 
in appeals defense lawyers pointed to evidence that prejean had 
an iq of 76 and that according to a psychiatrist he performed 
on tests at a level of borderline retardation 
but the threejudge 5th circuit panel said that neither 
prejeans limited mental ability nor his age at the time of the 
crime constituted reasons to reverse the death sentence 
prejean is not mentally retarded as that term is defined by 
the american association on mental retardation as one with an iq 
of 70 or below wrote chief judge charles clark 
the 5th circuit also rejected arguments that the execution 
should be stopped because prejean who is black had an allwhite 
jury saying lawyers failed to prove blacks were eliminated from 
the jury in a discriminatory manner 
prejean was sent to prison in march 1980 and has been on death 
row longer than any of the other 35 condemned men he has had eight 
stays of execution in the last 10 years

entrance to the santa monica pier on tuesday morning 
they wouldnt make much sense in toronto or cincinnati or des 
moines but they make a lot of sense here at the city by the bay 
said artist laddie john dill during unveiling of the arty lamp pole 
decorations 
word spread this week that the new banners were going up and 
telephones began ringing incessantly at santa monica area chamber 
of commerce offices 
the marine theme was too much of a departure from the religious 
significance of the season residents complained the chamber of 
commerce was taking christ out of christmas and the santa out of 
santa monica 
most of the calls involved concern we had done away with the 
traditional christmas decorations said chamber president duane 
nightengale the chamber sponsored the 15000 replacement project 
the traditional decorations are going to be up as well said 
the chambers dave paradis 
it is true the carolers holly and bells on the old banners are 
gone nightengale said but the nativity scene still adorns 
palisades park and garland has been strung up at fourth street and 
wilshire boulevard 
michael segal who headed the design project as a member of the 
chambers central business district advisory group said the 
strong marine motif captured the citys uniqueness 
the kelp gives a mistletoe feeling the dolphins are in a 
wreath design and the gull looks like a christmas dove of peace 
segal said 
adding to the holiday ambiance of gulls kelp and sea mammals 
were the words peace friendship and joy 
dill designed the 3footby7foot banners with graphic artist 
john van hamersveld they look like greeting cards dont they 
asked hamersveld 
i wanted something that was more tailored to santa monica 
which has become the arts center of california added dill 
soviet emigre suzy hartwick squinting on a sunny day at the 
edge of the continent smiled and said they are very nice i 
love christmas it reminds me of home when i had a home

the transportation department issued 
drugtesting rules tuesday it said are aimed at ensuring accurate 
testing and protecting the privacy of employees in transportation 
industries 
federally mandated drugtesting including random testing 
begins in the aviation railroad marine trucking mass transit 
and pipeline industries next month employees in safetyrelated 
jobs will have to submit to the tests under programs their 
employers must set up 
the departments drugtesting program is to take effect in 
december despite several pending court challenges 
the final rules require employers to use certified laboratories 
and to send three blind samples for each 100 actual samples to 
be tested blind samples are urine specimens that have been spiked 
with drugs to test the laboratorys accuracy 
the rules also call for both initial screening and a 
confirmation test to ensure against false positive results as well 
as a determination by a physician that there is no legitimate 
medical explanation for a positive test result 
employers also may split an employees sample so that a second 
test may be run if the first is questioned 
the department said it rejected suggestions for an expansion of 
the number of drugs for which tests are run

the communists and socialists are urging voters to 
back conservative candidates for parliament in a painful and 
desperate bid to block the extreme right national front in two 
special elections next sunday 
neither leftist party could bring itself to utter the specific 
words but the message was clear everything must be done in the 
second round to keep the national front from winning seats in the 
national assembly and the only alternative is to vote for the 
traditional right 
the national fronts popularity has been buoyed by controversy 
over moslem immigrants from north africa and the right of 
schoolgirls to wear traditional islamic headscarves to class the 
national front scored big in the first round of special elections 
in marseille and dreux on sunday 
in both elections the socialists came in a dismal third 
next sundays runoffs will be a battle of the right with the 
national front candidate in dreux facing an opponent from the 
neogaullist rally for the republic and in marseille a 
centerright candidate of the union for french democracy 
the national front long has campaigned on an antiimmigration 
and france for the french platform and consistently has won 9 
to 145 percent of the vote in recent elections 
the voters are beginning to understand that our ideas are good 
sense said mariefrance stirbois who led all candidates in the 
race for the seat from dreux with 425 percent of the vote 
in marseille marieclaude roussel won 33 percent of the vote to 
finish second and get into the runoff 
said national front president jeanmarie le pen it is not 
against the national front but with it that the future must be 
envisaged if you want to get rid of socialism in this country 
the communist party politburo asked communist voters to do 
everything to defeat by their vote in the second round the 
candidates of the national front 
socialist premier michel rocard called on voters to defeat the 
national front the national front brings only violence never a 
solution 
the french always seem surprised at each good performance by the 
extreme right party french pollster jerome jaffre says that is 
because many people are ashamed to admit they harbor extreme right 
sentiments yet they vote that way 
for seven weeks a controversy has raged over the right of 
schoolgirls to wear the hijab or islamic scarf to school the law 
in this mostly roman catholic country calls for strict secularity 
in schools 
the council of state frances highest administrative authority 
issued an ambiguous opinion monday saying girls could wear the 
hijab to school if it was not disruptive it left it to school 
authorities to decide in individual cases 
the original problem arose because local school authorities made 
just such a decision and prohibited the girls from attending class 
le pen said the demand for mosques with a huge one recently 
approved in lyon and the wearing of the hijab are antinational 
actions that threaten our security our identity our integrity 
a recent poll indicated that 67 percent of the french think 
borders should be closed to further immigrants 
eightythree percent oppose wearing the hijab in school 
the antiimmigrant antagonism seems directed specifically at 
moslems 
immigrants make up nearly 7 percent of frances 55 million 
people the national front claims immigrants take social benefits 
at the expense of frenchborn citizens

palestinian master terrorist abu nidal is 
under medical supervision at his home in libya after recurrence of 
a heart ailment but his life is in no immediate danger two senior 
plo officials said tuesday 
the officials interviewed separately by telephone from 
palestine liberation organization headquarters in tunis tunisias 
capital called inaccurate reports from algeria that abu nidal 
was dying of cancer 
they also denied reports he was under house arrest 
abu nidal 52 tops us european and asian most wanted lists 
his henchmen stand accused of killing nearly 1000 people most of 
them civilians in attacks around the world 
an algerian medical source who recently returned home from libya 
said abu nidal real name sabri albanna is in a military 
hospital in libya suffering from a cancerous metastase that is 
probably terminal 
a metastase is cancerous tissue that spreads the disease 
throughout the body 
its not cancer its his heart said one of the plo 
officials who insisted on anonymity he has been bedridden for 
two weeks 
the plo sources said their information was based on reports from 
reliable libyan security officials 
the other official said abu nidal complained of chest pains for 
weeks and libyan physicians initially attributed it to mere 
exhaustion 
but he said the terrorist began complaining of breathing 
difficulties prompting doctors to confine him to bed after he 
refused to be taken to a hospital 
dissidents reported this month that abu nidal had become 
increasingly paranoid after a bloody split in the ranks of his 
fatahrevolutionary council in which at least 200 activists died 
they said he never leaves his home in a fenced training base on 
the outskirts of tripoli he has lived in libya since syria 
expelled him in 1987 
the new york times reported in tuesdays editions that libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi under pressure to rein in the terror 
network that damaged the palestinian crusade for statehood had put 
abu nidal under house arrest 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said in 
washington tuesday we dont know if abu nidal was under house 
arrest 
one report today has that he has cancer and is in a 
hospital she said we dont know one report has that hes 
arrested we just dont know 
the plo officials said abu nidal underwent openheart surgery in 
bulgaria in 1984 
but doctors reported only 70 percent success after the double 
bypass operation he has had one or two mild heart problems 
but nothing too serious one source said 
he said the latest setback may be more complicated because of 
the physical mental and psychological stress hes been under a 
reference to the split in abu nidals organization 
abu nidal gained popularity among the frustrated youth of 
palestinian refugee camps in lebanon after the 1982 israeli 
invasion 
his group grew that year from 300 to about 1000 young men 
pledged to an armed struggle against israel 
but later many followers began questioning the link between 
terrorist attacks they were ordered to undertake and the liberation 
of their homeland 
complaints increased after a puzzling alliance that abu nidal 
struck in 1985 with hezbollah or the party of god abu nidal 
preaches maoism hezbollah is a proiranian fundamentalist moslem 
group in lebanon 
abu nidal was born in jaffa in 1937 the 14th child of a 
prominent landowner and taught school in jerusalem he joined 
fatah the mainstream plo faction after leaving for saudi arabia 
following the 1967 arabisraeli war 
he is married and has at least two children a son and a 
daughter a short stocky balding man the elusive abu nidal 
seldom appears in public or gives interviews 
he reportedly played a leading role in the massacre of israeli 
athletes at the 1972 olympic games in munich west germany 
abu nidal whose war name means father of the struggle in 
arabic split from fatah in early 1973 with another officer ahmed 
abdulghaffour 
that august they killed five people and wounded 55 in a grenade 
and pistol attack at athens airport plo chairman yasser arafat 
publicly said then that the two must be sought and executed 
ghaffour was killed a month later abu nidal pledged to kill 
arafat blaming him for ghaffours death 
abu nidal gunmen proceeded to kill at least 16 top aides of 
arafat in europe and the middle east 
notorious attacks by abu nidals terrorists included the 
november 1985 hijacking of an egyptian airliner to malta in which 
59 people died twin raids on rome and vienna airports that killed 
20 people on dec 27 1985 and a pan am jet hijacking in karachi 
pakistan in september 1986 that killed 21 people

the pentagon should consider moving military 
units out of bases in highly populated areas to make room for 
increased civilian aviation a general aviation industry official 
proposed tuesday 
some would say that this is a radical and unrealistic 
suggestion said max e bleck chairman of beech aircraft corp 
but until a few weeks ago anyone who suggested that east 
germany would punch holes in the berlin wall would have been called 
radical and unrealistic said bleck 
bleck said units at bases in highly populated and congested 
areas could be moved to bases the defense department is closing in 
less populous areas 
both bleck who also is chairman of the general aviation 
manufacturers association and edward w stimpson the 
organizations president called for increased civilian use of 
military airports they addressed an aviation industry meeting 
transportation officials estimate that the demand for commercial 
aviation will double in the next 10 years while it will take 
longer than that for any new airports to be approved and built 
bleck said president bush and the secretaries of defense and 
transportation should draw up a plane for the civilian use of 
nonstrategic military airfields around the country 
stimpson said the new spirit of cooperation between the united 
states and the soviet union and potential defense cutbacks could 
lead to unemployment in defense industries but he said a 
resurgence of general aviation could supply thousands of jobs to 
trained workers

seatac wash ap sex offenders would get sentences of up to 
life in prison and be required to register with the police under 
recommendations of a state task force formed after two shocking sex 
crimes 
gov booth gardner endorsed the recommendations 
unequivocally on tuesday and the measures are expected to sail 
through the legislature after it convenes on jan 8 
the panels recommendations came after months of public hearings 
in which residents recounted family tragedies at the hands of 
sexual predators the families also complained about a corrections 
system they contended could not protect them from habitual 
criminals 
the panel was spurred by the sexual mutilation of a tacoma boy 
in may and the rape and murder of a seattle businesswoman nine 
months earlier 
during the committees work three boys in vancouver and 
portland ore were slain allegedly by a sex offender and an 
18yearold female jogger was slain near acme 
king county prosecutor norm maleng who heads the 24member 
committee referred to the vancouver and acme slayings as he sat 
next to gardner at the task forces final meeting 
the murder of amanda stavik occurred about a quartermile from 
my boyhood home that hit home for me personally maleng said 
police are still seeking leads in the case an autopsy report 
released tuesday was inconclusive but said the circumstances of her 
death were consistent with drowning police consider the case a 
homicide 
in the vancouver case westley allan dodd pleaded innocent to 
three counts of firstdegree murder tuesday and was held without 
bail 
gardner called the panels recommendations a broad and 
comprehensive approach to getting predatory sex criminals off 
washington streets 
step two is to take this and put it into legislation he 
said 
key lawmakers including senate law and justice committee head 
gary nelson said it will be a top priority from the first day of 
the session 
the committee included victims and relatives of sex criminals 
one of them ida balliasiotes said she thought the package was a 
good first start but may be some of the sentencing provisions could 
have been tougher 
her daughter diane balliasiotes was raped and slain after 
being kidnapped from in september 1988 gene raymond kane is 
serving a life sentence for her murder 
another panel member lucy berliner of the sexual assault 
center at harborview hospital in seattle acknowledged that the 
package would not have stopped the states most notorious sex 
killer ted bundy who was executed in florida earlier this year 
after a string of slayings in the west and in florida 
the recommendations which are expected to cost 15 million in 
the coming year and about 55 million in subsequent years would 
empower judges to sentence repeat rapists and child molesters 
to life in prison these crimes now carry a 10year maximum 
sentence 
permit prosecution as adults of 15yearolds who commit sex 
crimes of a heinous nature and 16yearolds who commit lesser sex 
offenses 
require convicted sex offenders to register with the washington 
state patrol and the sheriff failure to register would be 
punishable by up to five years in prison 
improve treatment of sex offenders including closely monitored 
postrelease treatment 
empower juries to indefinitely commit for treatment any sex 
offender found incompetent to stand trial maleng and gardner 
acknowledged possible civil rights concerns with the provision but 
said it would be used with discretion 
create a 25 millionayear fund to cover medical and other 
expenses of sex crime victims

tiny 21monthold alyssa smith who received the 
nations first livingdonor liver transplant appeared back on a 
smooth course tuesday after internal bleeding prompted a return 
to surgery her doctor said 
alyssa was in critical but stable condition after the second 
predawn surgery early tuesday to stop bleeding detected within 12 
hours of the monday transplant said dr christoph broelsch who 
headed the surgical team 
alyssas father john l smith of san antonio said the rushed 
return to the operating room caused some tense moments for him and 
his wife teresa the liver donor but that he was reassured when 
he saw his daughter 
i think she looked great even with the surgery and 
everything she looked great he said his voice trembling her 
eyes were kind of open and she saw me and her face kind of lit 
up a bit 
smith said his wife wants to go see alyssa of course she 
knows she cant do it right away every time i go in to see her 
thats all she wants to know she wants to hear shes fine from 
me 
alyssa was awake active and moving around after the second 
procedure although still on sedation and a ventilator broelsch 
said 
the transplant is definitely functioning and for now things 
are back on a smooth course he said at a midmorning news 
conference at the university of chicago medical center 
the bleeding on the surface of alyssas new liver which is 
about the size of a mans fist was a complication that occurs in 
about 30 percent of all liver transplants said dr peter 
whitington director of pediatric transplant services for the 
hospital 
doctors corrected the problem in a few minutes but kept her in 
surgery for nearly five hours of observation broelsch said 
doctors said alyssa may undergo another exploratory operation 
within a few days to examine the new liver 
mrs smith who became the nations first living 
livertransplant donor monday when doctors removed the left lobe of 
her liver for alyssas transplant was in fair condition tuesday 
they said she was moved from intensive care to a private room and 
could be discharged in a week 
in three to five days doctors will know if alyssa is healing 
properly and in a week they should know whether the body is 
rejecting the organ 
the transplanted liver already is working producing bile and 
performing other functions doctors said 
alyssa suffers from an oftenfatal liver disorder called biliary 
atresia the leading cause for liver transplants involving 
children she had been waiting more than a year for a cadaver 
transplant when her parents asked to participate in the hospitals 
livingdonor program 
smith said he felt helpless while his wife and daughter 
underwent surgery 
during mondays 14hour transplant operation the assistant 
shipping supervisor said he played with the couples 3yearold 
son ricky paced the hallway and kept in constant contact with 
hospital administrators 
mondays procedure was complicated when mrs smiths spleen was 
damaged and had to be removed but doctors predicted she would 
recover fully 
the hospital has authorized 20 livingdonor transplants to 
determine whether the procedure is worth the risks the germanborn 
broelsch developed the technique for using segments of donor livers 
in 1984 while at the university of hannover 
a second transplant involving a tennessee girl could come as 
early as next wednesday whitington sai 
the hospital has been deluged with calls from parents interested 
in the procedure he said but doctors will insist on physician 
referral 
i think that this procedure is not for everybody whitington 
said 
its for those parents who feel that there is a need to 
provide a piece of their liver for their child he said it is 
clear that we can take care of patients other ways other than 
through livingorgan donations 
the options include whole and partial liver transplants from 
cadavers 
but alyssas surgery is being closely watched because 
livingdonor transplants could provide a solution to the shortage 
of organs for young children who need transplants whitington said 
in the united states more than 700 babies each year need liver 
transplants and as many as half die for lack of a donor 
liver transplants from living donors have been performed only 
three times in brazil australia and japan all have been done in 
emergency situations and at least one child has died 
so far the only regularly performed livingdonor transplants 
have involved kidneys and some pancreas segments

a man who admitted killing a drug dealer 
during a botched robbery was given a reduced sentence after the 
judge read a letter in which the victims young children said they 
forgave the gunman 
shane garner who pleaded guilty to unintentional seconddegree 
murder for shooting duane fyten in the head may 26 in st paul was 
sentenced monday to 7 years 
the sentence imposed by ramsey county district judge j thomas 
mott is a year less than the minimum recommended by state 
guidelines he said garner deserved some leniency because he had 
assisted prosecutors cases against three codefendants because he 
clearly had not intended to kill fyten and because he had shown 
remorse 
garner choked back sobs when the judge read the letter from 
7yearold jessica and 6yearold jason fyten 
we wish you wouldnt have shot our dad it made us very sad 
and mad the letter said we miss our dad a lot sometimes the 
pain is so bad we can hardly stand it and we cry a lot you had no 
right to shoot our dad it was very wrong we are only 6 and 7 
years old but at least we know that he loved us 
we hope that you can stop doing drugs and selling drugs 
because you still have that chance we also hope that you have 
learned that crime doesnt pay 
the only thing we are happy about is that our dad doesnt have 
to suffer with drugs anymore 
we want you to know that we did forgive you for what you did 
the very day it happened please remember we dont hate you so 
dont let this ruin the rest of your life 
fyten 30 was shot in a brief struggle at the door of his 
apartment garner admitted firing the fatal shot but said he 
thought he had emptied the gun earlier by firing a round and then 
removing the clip however the pistol had already automatically 
reloaded the judge said 
robert williamson ii 20 of gem lake also pleaded guilty to 
seconddegree murder and was sentenced to 68 months in prison 
blaine christofferson 21 of st paul was sentenced to two years 
for attempted aggravated robbery frank derosa 22 of st paul 
the robbers getaway driver was sentenced to one year in jail and 
10 years on probation for simple robbery 
all four also were ordered to share in paying more than 16000 
in restitution to fytens family for his funeral and burial

a young man described as the sexual slave 
of his former girlfriend was sentenced to 34 years in prison 
tuesday for killing the girls mother 
superior court judge raymond r norko expressed compassion and 
outrage before imposing the sentence telling dennis coleman 21 
that whatever i do to you im basically throwing away your 
youth 
your youth will be spent at somers state prison norko 
said his eyes filling with tears i find somers probably the 
most dangerous place i know of on earth part of me goes with you 
but norko said testimony from coleman and his friends about 
the aug 5 1987 killing of joyce aparo sent a chill up my 
spine 
you and they come from a very middle class community yet 
your peers spoke of murder as if it was a candy bar on a shelf that 
could be reached by anybody 
coleman showed no emotion as norko passed the sentence 
colemans mother who sobbed quietly through the sentencing 
hearing buried her face in her hands as her son was led away 
coleman pleaded guilty to murder and conspiracy to commit murder 
in the stangulation of joyce aparo in her apartment under a plea 
bargain he had faced 30 to 42 years in prison 
coleman claimed that joyce aparos daughter karin aparo now 
18 begged him to kill her abusive mother 
assistant states attorney james e thomas argued for the full 
42year sentence reminding norko that coleman struggled with joyce 
aparo for 10 minutes before killing her 
this isnt something that took place in a split second he 
said this is a brutal coldblooded murder that took a long 
time 
calm and composed coleman addressed the court before being 
sentence 
if i could turn back time i would he said mr thomas 
says it was a coldblooded crime im not a coldblooded murderer 
it was the opposite of coldblooded it was passion 
prosecutors contend coleman and karin aparo plotted joyce 
aparos killing for more than a year karin aparo is awaiting trial 
in her mothers death after a superior court judge rejected her 
request for special probation earlier this month coleman is 
expected to testify against her 
colemans lawyer m hatcher norris said coleman will likely 
spend about 20 years in prison 
a tall slender redhead coleman appeared composed as he waited 
outside the courtroom with family friends and his new girlfriend 
before the sentencing 
he said he hasnt seen karin aparo since several weeks after 
joyce aparos slaying asked what he thought should happen to karin 
aparo coleman said i dont care shell be going to prison one 
way or another i guess she deserves it 
norris on tuesday portrayed aparo as manipulative calculating 
and amoral what i can only describe as a girl without a heart 
on the first day of a twoday sentencing hearing last week dr 
gerald a faris a glastonbury psychologist who has treated coleman 
for two years testified that coleman was pressured into the murder 
by his domineering girlfriend 
enslavement i guess you could call it faris said 
before coleman met aparo he had been suffering from a 
personality disorder that filled him with a deep emptiness leaving 
him vulnerable to obsessive love and even to being seduced into 
committing criminal acts faris testified 
at age 15 aparo sent coleman descriptive letters and pictures 
of sexual acts they would perform together witnesses testified by 
age 16 she had recorded in her diary about 100 times they had sex 
witnesses testified

the body of an 8yearold whose landmark 
legal battle opened schools to mentally disabled aids victims was 
flown tuesday to maryland for an autopsy her mother hopes will aid 
research into the incurable disease 
eliana martinez whose weight had dropped to about 15 pounds 
died of heart failure monday cradled in the arms of her adoptive 
mother 
she opened her eyes and there were tears in them she looked 
at me to help i could not rosa martinez said tuesday it was 
not a peaceful angellike death it was agonizing 
mrs martinez won a court battle to let eliana go to school 
without being sealed in a glass box to ensure that she would not 
infect her classmates 
funeral services were planned for early next week in tampa the 
date will depend on how much time doctors need at the national 
institutes of health in bethesda md said mrs martinez 
she died like she lived fighting every inch of the way 
mrs martinez said 
her body couldnt take it anymore said dan mcclowry 
elianas speech therapist and a close friend of mrs martinez 
over the last few days eliana had slipped in and out of coma 
seeing the joy she wont have makes you realize its not a 
house or money thats important mrs martinez said whatever 
youre doing you should enjoy it life is so short 
mrs martinez a licensed practical nurse answered a radio plea 
about an abandoned baby and adopted eliana as a sickly 11monthold 
from a hospital in puerto rico 
she then led the precedentsetting struggle to get eliana into 
public school with children her own age she said eliana needed to 
be with children her own age 
elianas twoyear federal court fight against the hillsborough 
county school system drew national attention 
fearing eliana posed a risk of transmitting aids to classmates 
and teachers education officials put the child on homebound 
education 
they feared eliana might transmit bodily fluids because she was 
not toilet trained and sucked her fingers but mrs martinez sued 
us district judge elizabeth kovachevich ruled in august 1988 
that eliana could attend a specialneeds school only if she sat 
inside a specially built 10000 glass booth 
mrs martinez appealed and the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta ordered a rehearing last december kovachevich 
reversed her decision last spring saying the health risk was 
remote and theoretical 
eliana went to school and sat at desks with classmates in april 
at manhattan exceptional center but after only a few weeks she 
became too ill for school 
she fought for her life all her life said teacher peggy 
kelly 
doctors believe she contracted the aids virus from tainted blood

syria rushed troops and armor into 
lebanon apparently building up for an imminent assault on the 
headquarters of gen michel aoun after lebanons new government on 
tuesday fired the stubborn christian army commander 
i shall fight unto death aoun vowed to thousands of youths 
who formed a human shield around the shellbattered hilltop 
presidential palace where he was barricaded five miles east of 
beirut 
he said the syrians will bear the guilt of a horrific 
massacre 
aoun does not recognize newly elected president elias hrawi a 
maronite catholic like himself and pledges to keep up his efforts 
to drive syrian troops from lebanon syria supports hrawi 
barbed wire covered the palace roof to guard against a paratroop 
raid and armorpiercing mines were planted in surrounding 
pinewoods aouns aides said 
france the christians traditional protector and the colonial 
power here until independence in 1973 stepped in to avert a new 
round of bloodletting in a civil war that has killed more than 
150000 people since 1975 
french envoy francois scheer met with hrawi in chtoura east 
lebanon and then drove to damascus for talks with syrian 
government officials 
the foreign ministry in paris declared in a statement that 
france will not be on the side of those who would assume the 
responsibility of again taking up violence 
in a telephone interview on france inter radio station following 
his dismissal aoun rejected as nonexistent all acts coming from 
a puppet power 
residents in chtoura a market town on the main beirutdamascus 
highway said the rumble of tanks armored personnel carriers and 
military trucks jolted them awake during the night 
the residents insisting on anonymity for security 
considerations said about 15000 to 16000 troops in 800 trucks 
poured in tuesday from syria 
they counted 120 artillery pieces 90 sovietdesigned t62 
tanks 40 multibarreled rocket launchers two mineclearing tanks 
and fuel trucks headied west toward the central mountains and 
beirut after crossing into lebanon 
other military sources said the reinforcements deployed along 
mountain ridges above the baabda presidential palace and on the 
green line which divides beirut into christian and moslem sectors 
syria the main powerbroker here has stationed 40000 troops on 
70 percent of lebanons territory under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
syria supports hrawi and a cabinet of national reconciliation 
under prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem which is seeking 
to implement a peace plan to end 14 years of civil war 
hrawi dismissed aoun a head of an interim military cabinet on 
sunday and gave him 48 hours to leave the baabda palace 
traditional seat of lebanese presidents or face a lightning 
assault 
aoun commanded some 20000 mainly christian units during a 
sixmonth battle against the syrians that was halted sept 22 by 
the arab leaguebrokered ceasefire 
before the peace plan was adopted aoun and hoss had led 
competing christian and moslem governments for 14 months 
aoun 54 rejects the peace accord approved by parliament last 
month and said hrawis election friday was unconstitutional 
because parliament chose him in the shadow of syrian 
occupation he demands syrian withdrawal as a condition for any 
settlement 
adm emile lahoud a 53yearold maronite was appointed to 
replace aoun as chief of the 42000member armed forces which 
split on sectarian lines after the government did so in september 
1988 
maj gen sami khatib commands the 22000 moslem soldiers who 
are poorly equipped and stayed out of the battle 
the government is trying to reunite the armed forces under 
lahoud head of the small lebanese navy as part of hrawis effort 
to form a strong central government that can end the civil war 
defense minister albert mansour said in chtoura that soldiers 
who stuck with aoun would be dismissed but whoever declares 
loyalty to the legitimate auhorities remains a member of the army 
michel hayek a university student who stood outside the 
presidential palace said of aoun the general is the symbol of 
our independence if the syrians want to kill him theyll have to 
kill us first 
a jet fighter streaked over baabda at high altitude both 
christian and moslem antiaircraft gunners fired before it vanished 
over the mediterranean 
a spokesman for aouns command said it was a syrian mig23 but 
police said it could not be identified

rights the post left vacant all year after william lucas failed to 
win senate confirmation administration sources said tuesday 
dunne belongs to the allmale garden city golf club on long 
island and has said he would resign that membership if nominated to 
the justice department post 
dunne 59 of garden city is credited with helping reform the 
states prison system following the deadly riot at attica prison in 
1971 
meanwhile bush signed legislation tuesday extending the life of 
the us commission on civil rights through sept 30 1991 the 
panel shrouded in controversy during the reagan years had been 
faced with extinction 
the sources who insisted on anonymity said bush has settled on 
dunne for the civil rights job and dunne is undergoing a background 
clearance check before the white house formally announces the 
nomination 
that check could take up to two months 
dunne a graduate of georgetown university and yale law school 
resigned from the new york senate in september after losing a 
contest for majority leader in the republicancontrolled chamber 
after a 24year legislative career in which chaired the 
judiciary committee and rose to deputy majority leader dunne 
returned to practice law full time in uniondale 
a secretary who answered the telephone at dunnes office said 
only the senator has no comments and is referring all calls to 
the people in washington 
rep charles rangel dny an old friend of dunnes said in a 
telephone call from his new york office if the president has to 
pick a republican he couldnt pick a more decent person than john 
dunne 
rangel said dunne has the legal experience and training that 
the previous candidate lacked 
lucas a former sheriff and county executive from detroit was 
charged by critics with lacking credentials for the post his 
nomination was blocked in august on a 77 vote in the senate 
judiciary committee 
dunne has a reputation as a maverick in the nassau county 
republican party who ran on several occasions against its powerful 
gop machine 
during most of his 24 years in the legislature a parttime 
post he lived in albany at the fort orange club which admitted 
women to membership only last year 
dunne told newsday in an interview last week that he would 
resign his membership in the allmale garden city golf club if 
nominated to the justice post it would send the wrong message to 
stay he said it would be inappropriate 
attorney general dick thornburgh had backed dunne for the post

animal rights activists appealed tuesday to 
visiting south korean president roh taewoo to curb the cruel 
methods used in his country to kill dogs and cats for consumption 
they boil them alive hang them and even blowtorch them to 
death said richard moore director of the international fund for 
animal welfare 
moore was one of 50 protesters who gathered outside the lord 
mayors residence where roh was speaking during a fourday visit to 
britain 
roh who arrived in britain on monday made no mention of the 
issue in his lunchtime address in which he announced an 
unspecified reduction in south korean import tariff on scotch 
whisky 
roh held talks with prime minister margaret thatcher on tuesday 
evening before attending a dinner in his honor at her official 
downing street residence 
mrs thatcher expressed hope that barriers between north and 
south korea may be dismantled 
with so many barriers now coming down it may not be too much 
to hope that north korea will also be ready to respond to your 
efforts to open a dialogue she told her dinner guests 
roh said his support for democratic reforms in south korea in 
1987 effectively broke a political deadlock there 
democracy has just begun to take root in korea he said 
we have turned our backs on the authoritarian rule which held 
sway for so many years 
earlier demonstrators said 2 million cats and dogs are killed 
cruelly each year in south korea where the meat is considered by 
some to be a good protein source with a delicate taste 
the protesters said they were not objecting to consumption of 
dogs and cats but to the means used to kill them the south korean 
embassy said the methods have become more humane 
problems arise because of some of the killing methods used by 
elderly people in the countryside who dont know how to kill more 
humanely but in cities more sanitary and modernized practices are 
used said spokesman byung hosuh 
kim keran who is trying to set up a korean chapter of the 
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals gave a letter to 
a south korean delegation calling for new laws to ensure that dogs 
are killed humanel 
dog meat was first used when the country was very poor and 
there was no other alternative she said but now the economy 
is stronger there is no excuse to carry on this cruelty 
south korean officials say international protests are based on a 
misunderstanding that south koreans eat their pets rather than 
dogs and cats bred for their meat

the 2000 city officials from around the country 
meeting tuesday gave president bushs housing secretary a standing 
ovation for a emotional speech about a new housing and jobs program 
for the poor 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp said 
antipoverty legislation enacted in the 1960s was ineffective and 
based on paternalistic policies that promoted a permanent 
underclass 
noble goals were frustrated by overreliance on government 
entitlements overreliance on the redistribution of wealth and an 
attitude that poor people were unwilling or unable to become 
entrepreneurs producers job holders and homeowners kemp told 
the session of the national league of cities convention 
kemps talk focused the hope program unveiled earlier this 
month by bush he also called on the cities to eliminate the 
outrageous red tape and regulations such as some zoning and 
rent control laws and that he said limit affordable housing 
he said he has seen through visits to housing projects across 
the country evidence that poor people can pull themselves out of 
poverty with the type of programs bush is now promoting 
i reject the attitude that nothing can or should be expected 
from poor americans kemp said 
bushs 21 billion program provides grants for nonprofit 
housing groups rehabilitation of vacant public housing units 
antidrug programs and servicesupported housing for the homeless 
kemp said 
kemp said he also has directed the federal housing 
administration to set aside 10 percent of fhaforeclosed housing 
for lease to nonprofit groups to help the homeless

sen christopher dodd dconn said tuesday 
he was outraged that bush administration officials had suggested 
publicly that a connecticut woman is guilty of aiding rebels in el 
salvador 
when an american is in legal trouble in another country 
particularly a country in which the tradition of equal justice is 
not firmly established the us government ought to either 
publicly insist on its citizens innocence or keep its official 
mouth shut dodd said in a written statement 
it may be news in some quarters of the white house and the 
state department but we have a tradition in this country of 
presuming the innocence of persons who have been arested unless and 
until they are proven guilty added dodd who chairs the senate 
foreign relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere 
jennifer j casolo 28 a native of thomaston conn was 
arrested sunday and salvadoran police confiscated tons of 
ammunition buried in the garden of her home in san salvador they 
said the arms were stored there by guerrillas ms casolo had 
rented the house for three months with a roommate who left the 
country the morning before the raid 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of ms casolo on 
monday there are indications of her involvement thats for 
certain 
its fairly clear that these weapons were found there i mean 
were not talking about a small package of pistols here were 
talking about tons of equipment and mortars and dynamite and rounds 
of ammunitions and explosives this is hardly a case of someone 
having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way home 
on tuesday a justice department official said that agency is 
trying to determine whether ms casolo should be charged with 
violating the neutrality act which prohibits private us citizens 
from taking sides in wars in which the united states is not 
involved 
justice department prosecutors and fbi agents were reviewing the 
circumstances of the case but had not opened a formal 
investigation said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
to establish a violation of the neutrality act prosecutors 
would probably have to show that the woman was part of an effort to 
ship arms from the united states to the salvadoran rebels the 
official said 
evidence that a person stored weapons for rebels would not 
necessarily constitute a violation of the law the official said 
us authorities had not eliminated the possibility ms casolo 
was framed the official said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said ms 
cosolo technically is being held incommunicado by the national 
police but is being allowed regular visits by a us consular 
officer salvadoran officials said she has not been charged 
ms casolo was visited by rep jim mcdermott dwash a doctor 
who examined her at the request of the us embassy reported she is 
in good health 
ms casolos friends say she was framed by salvadoran 
authorities as part of an effort to discredit the church she 
provides tours of el salvador as a representative of the san 
antonio texasbased christian education seminars to visiting 
church members and others

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said tuesday the united states is obligated to pay its un dues 
even if the general assembly votes to recognize the plo as the 
nation of palestine 
with a showdown vote between the united states and plo looming 
friday diplomats said they have little hope for a compromise that 
would avert a us cutoff of funds for the united nations 
on monday the palestine liberation organization said arab 
nations plan to push a resolution through the general assembly 
recognizing the plo as an observer nation 
the state department immediately threatened to cut off all us 
support for the united nations if the general assembly approved the 
step washington is assessed 216 million annually onefourth of 
the un budget 
i dont like the word threat perez de cuellar said 
tuesday you cannot threaten me if i ask you to pay what you owe 
me dont you think so 
sometimes i think i have the impression that the americans 
think that theyre making a loan the americans ought to pay what 
they owe 
what i dont understand is the link how they link the two 
things together he said 
it is an obligation under the un charter its a treaty 
obligation added his spokesman francois giuliani 
european and nordic diplomats who often play a buffer role in 
the recurring usplo confrontations worked on a compromise but 
said privately they had little hope 
the anticipated assembly action also could jeopardize usplo 
talks washingtons ambassador to the united nations thomas r 
pickering said tuesday 
it has serious consequences for the peace process in the 
middle east our ongoing dialogue with the plo a lot of very 
important issues issues that i would say should be much more 
important to the plo than the mere change on a nameplate here in 
the united nations he said 
the united states has been engaged in talks since december with 
plo representatives in tunis tunisia through us ambassador 
robert pelletreau 
the plo wants its status as a permanent observer mission raised 
from that of organization to nation like north korea and south 
korea monaco the vatican san marino and switzerland 
observer nations dont have voting rights and can speak only if 
invited by the assembly 
upgrading the plos status would take a simple majority vote of 
the 159 general assembly members as a member of the 102member 
nonaligned movement the plo has more than enough votes to prevail 
a western diplomat said the europeans were holding talks with 
the plo and united states to try to find a way out but did not 
sound encouraging 
the effects of the us withholding would be extremely 
damaging at this time he said 
the united states has paid 65 million of its 216 million 
assessment but is still more than 307 million in arrears to the 
regular budget from withholding un dues during the reagan 
administration 
former president ronald reagan ordered us dues withheld until 
the world body trimmed its budget and bureaucracy 
last year he expressed satisfaction with the united nations 
progress in reform and ordered full repayment of us dues but 
congress has not authorized payment of the arrears citing budget 
deficits 
congress recently passed a foreign appropriations bill that 
requires the bush administration to cut funds for any group that 
moves to recognize the plo or upgrade its status 
last year the plo declared the existence of a state of 
palestine in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and the 
plo says 117 nations have recognized it 
the united states most european nations and a few from latin 
america have not saying it lacks the basic attributes of a nation 
such as sovereignty and secure borders

the pilots log of a jetliner that 
crashed with no survivors indicates a threeinch fissure was found 
in the fuselage three days before the plane exploded in the air a 
bogota newspaper reported tuesday 
the 26yearold avianca airlines boeing 727 carried 101 
passengers and six crew members when it exploded monday morning 
five minutes after taking off from bogota on a domestic flight to 
cali 
a woman who answered the telephone at aviancas public relations 
office refused comment on the el tiempo report and would not 
identify herself 
tom cole of boeing commercial airplanes in seattle said late 
tuesday that the manufacturer had not received any report of the 
crack he said newspaper clippings from colombia that had been 
received by boeing indicated this was a model airplane that it 
had a clean maintenance record 
boeing says the 727 aircraft was delivered to pan am on may 28 
1966 pan am transferred the plane to avianca at the end of 
december 1975 
el tiempo gave no further details but a spokesman for the paper 
said policemen had found the log scores of policemen were involved 
in searching the wreckage monday 
col edgar lesmes assistant director of the civil air 
authority said the agency did not have the log and was trying to 
determine whether it had been found 
the only thing we have been able to establish is that there 
was an inflight explosion for unknown reasons he said in an 
interview with the caracol radio network 
he said investigators have found no trace of explosives or 
explosive devices in the wreckage 
col jorge gonzalez the agencys chief of operations told a 
news conference oxygen masks had dropped from the overhead 
consoles that is automatic in a case of pressure loss and would 
occur if an explosion ripped a hole in the cabin 
wreckage was spread over six miles but most was within an area 
about two miles long in grassy hills south of bogota 
a spokesman for the colombian pilots association told the 
associated press on monday night given the circumstances of the 
crash i would say that it was a terrorist attack 
an avianca pilot said the crew probably would have spotted 
trouble in advance if mechanical failure had caused the accident 
both pilots asked to remain anonymous so their jobs would not be 
put in jeopardy 
on monday the civil aviation authority said no problems had 
been reported by the planes crew 
lesmes said a flight recorder of cockpit conversation was found 
but another instrument recording flight data still was missing 
caracols bogota station said tuesday it believed a telephone 
call claiming drug traffickers blew up the plane may have been a 
hoax 
three hours after the crash a man called the station and said 
the extraditables referring to drug traffickers who could be 
extradited to the united states were responsible 
station executives decided the call may not have been authentic 
because the man was babbling and emotional a spokesman for caracol 
said privately 
investigators from the us drug enforcement administration have 
found no evidence that drug cartels were responsible justice 
department spokesman daniel eramian said in washington 
bombs have exploded at hotels restaurants supermarkets 
shopping centers and other public places in colombia in the past 
three months killing 29 people and wounding 236 drug traffickers 
are trying to dissuade the colombian government from extraditing 
suspects to the united states 
numerous witnesses have told radio stations and newspapers they 
saw two explosions monday and that the plane fell in pieces 
el tiempo published an account by a man who said he spent 15 or 
20 minutes each morning watching planes through binoculars after 
they took off from the bogota airport 
john bautista polanco said he was following the avianca plane 
when boom it became a big red ball of flames and then it 
broke apart and started to fall there were two balls of flames 
which began to look like columns as the plane went down 
the plane had been transformed in a second nothing unusual 
happened before that i saw that everything looked normal 
there wasnt any smoke or anything out of the ordinary

a soldier claiming to be the 
cousin of south africas defense minister is seeking asylum after 
accusing his army unit of killing and torturing civilians an 
amsterdam organization said tuesday 
the dutch antiapartheid movement identified the man as corp 
mervyn malan 27 and said he had served with a reconnaissance unit 
known as recce 53 that was part of south africas special forces 
a statement issued by the movement quoted malan as saying recce 
53 engaged in systematic torture bombing of villages and 
burning of women and children in namibia and angola 
it reported he said i have seen and done terrible things i 
will never be part of any killing again 
my cousin the general defense minister magnus malan 
doesnt protect me hes the one who wants me killed 
antiapartheid movement spokesman bart luirink told the 
associated press the selfprofessed defector described himself as a 
full cousin to the defense minister but did not know the exact 
family links 
he reported south african defense ministry officials said they 
had never heard of a corp malan 
the statement reported the defector gave this account about 
leaving south africa 
he fled to swaziland in 1988 after ignoring a callup for a 
second tour of duty with the special forces in which he served from 
198285 
he was pursued to swaziland by a special forces group and 
decided to come to the netherlands in december 1988 
the decision to request political asylum was made several months 
ago because the publicity could serve his cause 
the justice ministry was closed at the time the statement was 
distributed and it could not be determined if an asylum request had 
been received and was being processed 
malan decided to quit the army after being involved in an april 
1988 raid in namibia where he was ordered to throw phosphorous 
grenades into a civilian truck carrying women and children 
according to the statement 
luirink reported malan said all of the people were killed but 
he had no figures 
namibia is a territory that was administered by south africas 
whiteminority government until this fall when elections were held 
under a unsponsored agreement the accord provides for 
independence for the territory also known as southwest africa 
namibia is sandwiched between south africa and angola and for 
years south african forces went into angola to attack bases of 
southwest africa organization guerrillas fighting for independence

often rock performers least interesting songs 
are about the hardships of touring playwright kathleen tolan has 
brought a similar concept about her craft to the stage in kates 
diary with similar results 
the play opened tuesday night offbroadway in the public 
theaters small susan stein shiva theater david greenspan directed 
the play mixes scenes from kates real life and from a play 
she has written there is some cleverness in the juxtaposition of 
scenes although the scenes arent labeled a viewer doesnt get 
mixed up but neither does a viewer get involved 
in the first scene kate acted by lizbeth mackay sits on her 
double bed as michael bryan french and laura hughes enact a murder 
scene from her play 
french also plays frank who lives with kate hughes also plays 
kates friend to whom kate complains about frank the bloom has 
long gone from kate and franks romance and the two constantly 
irritate each other its a surprise when we learn in the last 
scene that theyve gone ahead with their planned marriage 
one scene from kates play has rafael baez as pablo a 
salvadoran peasant recount how as a soldier for the government 
he had to shoot villagers chosen for sacrifice by their villages 
until he broke down its a moving monologue 
however when a successful playwright john griesemer 
condescendingly tells kate that her plays characters and 
situations dont add up he seems to have the right idea

to criticize the 1968 sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia in an 
interview published tuesday in the italian communist party

a lot of value on it it is the principle of freedom of choice of 
noninterference these principles were always proclaimed but not 
always respected now we are scrupulously following them and we act 
in such a way that our words are not different from our acts 
lunita reported shevardnadze said that in the soviet union and 
east bloc countries the principal tendency is the democratization 
of society the formation of a democratic socialism 
turning to this weekends ussoviet summit shevardnadze was

it was pretty tacky when the us postal service 
refused to accept its newly issued nolick stamp but a postal 
official trying to put the best face on a sticky situation admitted 
he was licked 
we probably did our usual terrible job of internal marketing 
and didnt let our employees know we were test marketing this 
said dick able postal service marketing director in denver where 
the stamps are being tested 
it sounds like weve already antagonized one customer he 
said 
edward cook an airline consultant got a bit unglued after the 
san francisco post office didnt recognize the tackyback stamp on 
a letter he was trying to send to his daughter at stanford 
university 
not only did the postal service return his letter marked not a 
postage stamp but the postman also charged him 25 cents for 
returning his letter 
the new stamps which cost an extra 3 cents each are guaranteed 
to stick without licking 
i didnt want to pay 28 cents for a stamp i could get for 25 
cents but my wife wanted to try them cook said im sure not 
buying any more 
in the meantime the post office has offered cook free delivery 
of his letter and an apology 
able said there has been a surge in demand for the new stamp 
but he doesnt know why 
we dont know if its because they like them or they think 
these will be the first last and only version and theyll become 
a collectors item he said

and accused the presidents centerleft aprista party of spreading 
lies

public workers if elected and the president said the government 
employs only 507000 people 
at a news conference tuesday vargas llosa denied he had said he 
would fire a half million employees and said he would resign his 
candidacy if garcia could prove that he did 
where is the recording of that declaration said vargas 
llosa i defy president alan garcia to show that recording 
he also disputed garcias figures saying the government employs

two plastic surgeons worked a miracle for 
a young man from bolivia who had a quarter of his brain and part of 
his skull blown away by a bullet five years ago 
i cant believe it its incredible pacho penaloza 21 
said monday through interpreter jose trejo 
penaloza who flies home friday said hes eager to return to 
school 
in 1984 in his hometown of la paz bolivia penaloza and a 
friend were looking at the friends fathers pistol when it fired 
the bullet entered just above penalozas left eye and emerged from 
the back of his head 
he survived surgery but his prognosis was grim doctors told 
his mother elvira rosales paralysis of his right side was 
expected and she said she was told he wouldnt speak again he was 
in a coma for two months 
but when he awoke his efforts to speak regain his strength and 
write with his left hand astonished his family and doctors the 
major problem which his doctors were incapable of treating was 
that his brain was extremely vulnerable covered on the left side 
by only a thin layer of scar tissue 
when his mother heard that ana trejo was visiting from st 
paul working on an adoption project for the childrens home 
society of minnesota ms rosales crashed a luncheon and asked her 
to find help for her son 
two years after the shooting everything was arranged except the 
paperwork to get penaloza out of the country said mrs trejos 
husband jose it was three more years before penaloza would reach 
the united states 
united hospital where trejo was a board member had agreed to 
provide hospitalization joseph skow and frank pilney were to 
perform the delicate reconstructive operation with a neurosurgeon 
on standby 
finally in july penaloza arrived in st paul 
skow and pilney said monday that the first step was to stretch 
pachos scalp so they would have a flap of skin to cover the bone 
graft with which they intended to cover his brain 
using a device more familiar in breast reconstruction surgery 
they installed an inflatable plastic pouch called a tissue expander 
at the base of his skull at weekly intervals over several months 
they injected the balloon with fluid each time stretching the 
scalp a little further 
when the scalp was ready the surgeons removed a plate of bone 
from the right side of his head and split it longitudinally 
its like a sandwich said skow the skull contains a 
layer of blood vessels between two hard shells of bone we put the 
outer shell right back where we got it and grafted the other onto 
the other side 
they also borrowed a section of his bottommost right rib to 
fill out the skull the final step was to stretch the expanded 
scalp over the bone graft to his left ear 
once all his hair grows back the defect will be hardly 
noticeable skow said 
neurologically penalozas development continues to be 
promising although his right fist remains clenched and he has a 
slight limp initially there were concerns about his shortterm 
memory but those problems seem to be fading and his speech is 
lucid

chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday 
proposed a german federation as part of a sweeping plan to reunite 
the two countries after four decades of postwar division 
east germany has increasingly discussed the possibility of a 
confederation but the communist nations leader egon krenz ruled 
out any talk of reunification 
a unity of germany isnt on the agenda krenz told west 
germanys ardtv network in insisting on the continued existence of 
two sovereign independent german states 
there are fears among europeans in the east and the west about 
the political and economic power of a reunified germany with 80 
million people 
kohl in a speech to parliament sought to allay those fears 
saying the germans will be a dividend for a europe that is 
coming together and never again a threat 
the united states favors reunification and state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler reiterated that position in 
washington on tuesday the soviet union has said the idea is 
dangerous and unrealistic 
kohl said he had no timetable in mind to carry out his ideas and 
made it clear it could take years to form a federation he said he 
hoped to discuss his proposals with east german leaders at a summit 
before christmas on monday his spokesman hans klein said 
the meeting might be held on dec 19 
east german government spokesman wolfgang meyer said kohls plan 
in general provided interesting starting points for 
negotiations 
but writer stefan heym and a number of other east german 
artists clerics and intellectuals rejected reunification saying 
they opposed their country being pocketed by west germany the 
group said it would start a petition drive in support of its appeal 
kohls proposals were the most thorough delineation he has made 
yet of his vision of ending the division of germany imposed after 
world war ii 
earlier hansjochen vogel the leader of the opposition social 
democrats proposed an eventual confederation as a step toward 
unity 
in the past the social democrats have cautioned against 
hastening toward german reunification some in the leftist party 
have flatly opposed it 
we are now standing at the start of a new period in european 
and german history a period that points beyond the status quo or 
the hitherto political structures in europe kohl told parliament 
we are prepared to develop confederative structures 
between the two states in germany in order to create a federation 
a federal state in germany 
a federation is a union of states with a central government a 
confederation is an alliance of independent nations for a common 
purpose 
kohl also said reunification must be bedded in the 
paneuropean process and in eastwest relations the future 
structure of germany must fit into the whole architecture of europe 
as a whole 
he said his proposal could only be carried out if east germany 
holds free elections as it has promised 
the chancellor proposed creation of joint governmental and 
parliamentary committees for permanent consultation between the 
germanys 
he also suggested such committees to deal with economic 
environmental cultural and scientific matters and he said they 
could be set up soon after free elections in east germany 
kohl said west germany is prepared to offer concrete 
assistance to embattled east germany where it is urgently needed 
but he said massive assistance would be contingent on east 
germany irreversibly setting into motion a fundamental change 
of its political and economic system 
east germany has rejected previous demands that it replace its 
planned economy with a marketoriented one 
nato secretary general manfred woerner said in brussels 
belgium that kohls proposal for reunification was compatible with 
the western alliances vision of a future europe 
the plan links the development of the german future to the 
larger process of building europe and to the existing institutions 
of the west he said

federal officials began examining a rule 
tuesday that allows humans to swim with captive dolphins in hopes 
of determining whether the benefits to some people are outweighed 
by harm to the mammals 
in the florida keys home of three of the nations four dolphin 
swim parks supporters say the programs give humans a better 
understanding of dolphins and that the animals are protected 
against overexposure to people 
but some environmental groups say contact with untrained people 
could be dangerous and that too little is known about the 
transmission of diseases and effects on the dolphins natural 
bahavior 
both views were heard tuesday in islamorada as about 100 people 
attended a public hearing by the national marine fisheries service 
which regulates the dolphin swim programs a series of hearings is 
planned to help update the policy 
i have on file thousands of letters from people expounding on 
the virtues of their experience with the dolphins said michael 
wood general curator of the theater of the sea in islamorado 
there is nothing to suggest any ill effects to the dolphins or 
humans 
nancy daves hicks eastern regional director of the animal 
protection institute said dolphins have become victims of their 
own popularity 
dolphins do not knock on the front door of these facilities 
and ask to be let in they are chased netted and captured 
she said 
according to a federal study 40000 people are expected to 
participate in swimwithdolphins programs this year the four 
facilities have 34 atlantic bottlenose dolphins and one california 
sea lion in captivity 
the dolphins do not seem harmed by the interaction with humans 
said jeanne burns a spokeswoman at the dolphin research center on 
grassy key 
some dolphins in tanks with other dolphins actually want to 
get into the tank with the humans she said there doesnt seem 
to be any problems 
the center whose fiveyear swim program is the nations oldest 
allows 16 people a day in the dolphin tanks for 15 minutes five 
days a week 
besides satisfying curious tourists the nonprofit center has 
conducted studies that indicate swimming with dolphins help the 
learning process of emotionally and mentally disabled children and 
may improve competitive swimmers performance 
its one of those wonderful things that pull on your heart 
strings but we have to be careful with programs such as these 
said laura rubin spokeswoman for the environmental group 
greenpeace 
bottlenosed dolphins the species favored for the swim programs 
were devastated in recent years by mysterious mass deaths along the 
atlanti coast 
it does not make sense to go out and capture an animal whose 
stocks are already depleted in its natural habitat said ms 
rubin 
ms burns at the dolphin research center said dolphins used for 
the swim programs have been bred in captivity

for east germanys jews the democratic 
change battering the communist government stirs new hopes and old 
fears 
i feel fearful when people get up and say hang the 
communists because when it starts with the communists it always 
ends with the jews said economist and writer irene runge a 
prominent member of east germanys tiny jewish community 
when newspapers say disaster threatens because poles and other 
foreigners are smuggling this to me has the sound of the nazis 
the crumbling of the berlin wall however has raised hopes that 
the east german government will finally pay reparations to jewish 
victims of the nazi holocaust and to israel and hand over billions 
of dollars worth of jewishowned buildings in east berlin seized by 
the nazis 
east germanys decision nov 9 to let its 165 million citizens

echoes of joy offers aaron r moore some 
challenges that directors of ordinary gospel choirs never know 
when there are discipline problems rehearsal stops and members 
pray it got so bad a year ago they had to report to sunday morning 
services and sit in the choir box without singing for a month 
initially they were angry behind the disciplining but later 
they appreciated it moore said furthermore they have to accept 
the rules theyre prison inmates 
the choirs first tape we are not ashamed was a sellout 
but the blessing was mixed moore had to refuse the invitations to 
perform that ensued because only a few of the echoes are 
allowed to travel 
and the choir is now an a capella group because the pianist 
got moved to maximum security a few years ago said chaplain 
frank pennell of the delaware correctional center near smyrna the 
choir has done a good job without music 
a majority of them are just learning how to sing and they pick 
it up by ear some have sung on the street before 
now they sing behind bars echoes of joy averaging 18 to 24 
members sings during sunday and other christian services at the 
prison 
ira shy grew up with moore in wilmington i remember him from 
when i was a little kid and i remember him always being a singer 
moore said at one time we did sing together on a young adult 
choir 
but shy 43 was in and out of jail as well as church shy 
serving 12 years for drug trafficking said his problems came from 
not having a personal relationship with god now he has that 
relationship he said and its been easy since i decided to do 
it right 
being a bornagain christian is a prerequisite for 
membership we discern that when we interview said pennell 
prospective members also take a 15week class on basic christian 
principles then serve a 60day probation and if everythings 
fine they stay on he said 
the lord is working through the choir said arthur e 
cleckly 26 who has served two years of a threeyear sentence for 
intent to deliver marijuana its a blessing to see christ 
working in their lives we may be cast down by society but the 
lord has forgiven us 
raymond c davis 39 who wrote the title song of the choirs 
second tape jesus saves was born again in 1986 
i realized my life wasnt going anywhere i was a drug addict 
an alcoholic and i had no relationship with my six kids i 
hadnt really been a father said davis who became eligible for 
parole in august after three years of a sevenyear term for robbery 
and conspiracy 
i didnt have a friend in the world thats how i know jesus 
saves he stepped right in and showed me what i needed in my life 
he has truly cured me of my drug addiction and took the taste 
of alcohol from me 
about 200 of the 500 copies of jesus saves have been sold at 
5 each since it was recorded last december pennell said all 500 
copies of we are not ashamed were sold within two years of its 
1986 recording the proceeds go to buy materials for bible classes 
and members get 50 on release from prison 
choir rehearsals open with prayer a scripture and personal 
testimonies 
then moore takes over 
if its a new song he sings it then the choir sings it back 
the members enthusiasm and their ability to learn quickly 
lets him know they enjoy it they remember what they hear without 
music and thats hard to do usually a person can remember a tune 
before they remember the words these brothers can remember a tune 
and the words without music thats a gift and an art to be able to 
do that 
but there are problems 
there are attitude problems what they are mainly are 
spiritual growth problems the brothers are learning how to live 
for christ and dealing with it and sometimes they bring that stuff 
to rehearsal said moore 34 a minister counselor and food 
services director for the marriott corp in hockessin 
they bring things from home and emotional things and sometimes 
it can get to be a little too much for them

older blacks help themselves handle 
stress and build selfesteem through religious involvement 
according to a recent university of michigan study 
religious involvement helped increase selfesteem for older 
blacks who help others and through association with the respected 
institution of church said neal m krause associate professor of 
health gerontology at the universitys school of public health 
personal beliefs that god will intervene in times of trouble 
also help relieve stress the study found 
however krause and coauthor professor thanh van tran of boston

sellers of homes have had an advantage over 
buyers in much of the country throughout the 1980s but that 
situation is likely to change in the early 1990s 
among the chief reasons a large inventory of unsold homes in 
many parts of the country falling mortgage rates and expectations 
of cuts to come and a relative decline in the age 25 to 34 
homebuying population 
in fact the mid20s to mid30s age group that produced a bulge 
of demand and higher prices in the 1980s is now shrinking as a 
percentage of the population although the impact on housing will 
be delayed until late in the decade 
at the same time the age group 65 and older is growing larger 
and could be a cause of more familysize houses coming on the 
market a consequence of that age categorys tendency to trade down 
in search of convenience over space 
how far mortgage rates will fall is debatable but the trend is 
lower and housing forecasters say it will continue into 1990 
three economists speaking at the annual convention of the 
national association of realtors in dallas this month agreed that 
the first half of the next decade would be characterized by falling 
interest rates 
the national average commitment rate for conventional loans in 
double digits through much of the 1980s had fallen to 979 percent 
early this month and loans of a halfpercentage point below that 
already have developed 
the improved climate is reflected in more favorable homebuying 
attitudes measured by the university of michigan in the october 
survey 26 percent of those interviewed mentioned the availability 
of good buys should that percentage be maintained for an entire 
quarter it would be a 30year record 
internal changes in the mortgage market might also help wouldbe 
buyers find the best possible rates while there will be fewer 
thrift institutions in the 1990s the amount of money available for 
mortgages might actually grow 
one reason for the expectation according to speakers at the 
realtors convention is the prospect of greater participation in 
the market by the federal national mortgage association and the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
this secondary market as it is called will absorb a much 
larger share of mortgages in the 1990s according to john tuccillo 
the realtors chief economist he also expects more overseas money 
to flow into the home mortgage markets 
in addition it is expected that more stress will be aimed at 
resolving the financing problems of low and moderateincome housing 
as a result of provisions in the financial institutions reform 
recovery and enforcement act 
under firreas affordable housing program each federal home 
loan bank will subsidize interest rates on advances to member 
institutions making longterm loans on such housing 
there will be a real emphasis to squeeze the mortgage 
finance system down to the lowincome portion of the housing 
sector tuccillo said 
whatever the consequences of demographic and market conditions 
now taking shape there is little likelihood of prices soaring 
during the 1990s as they did in many areas during the 1980s 
at the beginning of 1980 for instance the price of a typical 
starter home was 50000 realtor records show that in the third 
quarter of this year a comparable house sold for 80700 
while convention speakers said they expected houses will 
continue to appreciate most looked for much more stability than 
existed in the 1980s and if interest rates remain below 10 
percent it creates a buying combination

the rev sam hayes drives 220 miles across eastern wyoming each 
weekend to say mass at three rural churches but when hes sick or 
the weather makes travel impossible the parishioners are on their 
own 
a priest can make it only one sunday a month to st christopher 
mission in unalaska at the end of the chain of aleutian islands in 
alaska the other weekends brenda moscarella a laywoman puts the 
services together 
despite criticism they will undermine the sunday mass tradition 
in the united states the us roman catholic bishops have approved 
a rite for sunday celebrations in the absence of a priest it is 
intended to help several hundred parishes where no clergy are 
available some sundays 
what do we do on sunday if there is no priest do we tell 
those people to stay home asked bishop michael j sheehan of the 
diocese of lubbock in west texas its the best we can do in the 
situation were in namely the priest shortage 
sundays have always been special for christians 
there was no evidence until the late second century of separate 
easter celebrations of the resurrection of jesus for the early 
church every sunday fulfilled the same function 
more than half of the nations 53 million catholics attend mass 
on an average sunday 
sunday is the lords day sheehan said the catholic 
church wants the memory of the resurrection to stay alive in the 
catholic community 
with or without a priest 
a 1987 survey taken by the liturgy committee of the national 
conference of catholic bishops found there were already priestless 
celebrations in 51 dioceses an estimated 1000 parishes are in 
that situation sheehan said more such celebrations are expected as 
the clergy shortage worsens 
the number of american priests has dropped to 53000 from 59200 
in 1970 the ratio of worshipers to priests has gone from about 700 
per priest in 1955 to almost 1000 today 
the us priestless rite which still must be approved by the 
vatican follows guidelines for such celebrations that the vatican 
devised in response to requests from several bishops conferences 
throughout the world 
the service is similar to a mass with the main difference being 
that no one other than a priest can celebrate the eucharist in 
which catholics believe elements of bread and wine are consecrated 
into the body and blood of jesus a communion service in which 
hosts consecrated earlier by a priest are distributed may be 
substituted in the priestless celebration 
retired bishop william e mcmanus of the diocese of fort 
waynesouth bend in indiana warned the bishops at their fall 
meeting in october that approval of the rite will bless a monster 
that could destroy the sunday mass tradition and sunday mass 
obligation in the united states 
but people in the dioceses involved say the services are 
preferable to no mass at all 
the critical thing is we recognize we are a community said 
sister brenda aiken director of the office of pastoral 
administrators of the catholic diocese of anchorage in alaska 
i think the bottom line is yes it is important for people to 
gather said sister marie ann brent administrator of holy rosary 
church in dillingham in southern alaska 
she said there is no difference in attendance when a priest says 
sunday mass compared to the priestless celebrations and suggested a 
priest may not necessarily provide the best kind of ministry 
maybe we work a little harder on the building of the 
community she said 
others also praised the celebrations as a way of getting lay 
people more involved 
i would say that even if we didnt have a shortage of priests 
there would be great value in training laypeople sheehan said 
i see it as an opportunity to involve a greater number of people 
in the ministry of the church 
moscarella who holds three services each weekend for 30 to 50 
people said the priestless celebrations are good because people 
realize it isnt just them out there and someone on the altar but 
it should be group participation 
still the bishops said having a priest who acts in the 
person of christ celebrate mass remains the ideal 
in the outlying communities thats where they touch base with 
the church on a onceaweek basis hayes said they dont have 
an experience of church other than that 
why does he spend his weekend driving hundreds of miles across 
two counties in wyoming to say mass in small agricultural 
communities like sundance and upton and hulett for a total of less 
than 200 people 
to answer the lords call to take his message to the ends of 
the earth hayes said

on abcs china beach michael boatmans 
samuel beckett is frequently shunned because he works among the 
dead of the vietnam war 
beckett is assigned to the graves registration unit where he 
prepares those killed in action for return to this country 
he gives people the creeps said boatman people are 
suspicious they dont want to see this guy after their buddies got 
killed so except for his close friends people dont talk to him 
he spends most of his time by himself so not only is he 
sentenced to this horrible duty but hes sentenced to do it 
alone 
beckett may be televisions first mortician since digger odell 
on the original life of riley in 194950 beckett has a wry 
sense of humor but digger was played for laughs on the comedy 
series starring jackie gleason 
he is not however the only character named after the irish 
playwright scott bakulas timetraveling character on nbcs 
quantum leap is also named sam beckett the only reference on 
china beach to the real beckett who wrote waiting for 
godot was an episode called waiting for beckett 
the way it was explained to me a frustrated playwright in the 
army was in charge of assigning duties said boatman when a 
guy named samuel beckett came along he thought it was amusing to 
put him in graves registration duties of that job were to count 
casualties each day record the cause of death and make sure 
personal effects were sent to the family 
we take some liberties on the show he works as a mortician 
and he writes letters to the families in reality he wouldnt be 
doing all that 
beckett recently ended a relationship with a vietnamese woman 
played by elizabeth lindsey at the beginning of this season when 
the writers asked the actors to suggest stories for their 
characters boatman said he had heard of rear echelon soldiers who 
suffered from survivors guilt they had desk jobs and felt 
they were irrelevant to the war 
i thought it would be interesting if beckett goes into the 
bush boatman said hes suffering from survivors guilt and 
decides to go out he says hes not in the action hes in the 
results he thinks he can make a difference and keep somebody from 
becoming a casualty 
becketts going through a transition hes still shocked and 
horrified by the things he sees he hasnt become numbed to it 
hes still shocked but he realizes now he can make it hes 
finding ways to function he has a perspective of the war other 
people dont see or want to see hes there with death every day 
boatman cant seem to escape military connections he was born 
on an army base in colorado during his fathers military service 
he also spent a brief time in germany but grew up in chicago and 
its suburbs 
his first movie was hamburger hill in which he played a 
soldier in vietnam 
i was a grunt in the picture he said it was based on a 
true story about the assault on hill 937 it was a big controversy 
because hundreds of men were lost in taking the hill then it was 
abandoned as having no tactical value 
boatman had no interest in acting until high school when he was 
persuaded to try out for a school play he was cast in one of the 
leads and an acting career replaced plans to become a marine 
biologist he studied acting at western illinois university and 
went from there directly into hamburger hill 
after four months of filming in the jungles of the philippines 
he moved to new york 
i did an offbroadway play called something about that face 
that had only one performance he said then nothing for a 
while i handed out fliers on the street and worked as a security 
guard working as a guard was the worst job ive ever had in my 
life i was resented because i had a college degree and had done a 
movie they knew i wouldnt stay long 
hes an avid collector of comic books and video animation from 
japan 
i started collecting in kindergarten he said ive had 
several collections i lost my first in a flood i had to sell my 
second collection in college because i was desperate for money it 
was worth about 800 and i sold it for 90 the guy really took 
advantage of me later i was foolish enough to buy some of the 
books back at his prices

one of yossi peleds earliest memories was of 
the night he was hiding in a house in belgium when nazi soldiers 
arrived looking for jewish children they heard had been given 
shelter 
we were in the basement and i remember the sound of their 
boots he recalled banging his fist on the table to emphasize 
the sound of the jackboots it was the most frightening thing i 
ever heard in my life 
like peled who is now a majorgeneral and commander of israeli 
troops along the borders with lebanon and syria the holocaust 
still haunts israelis shadowing private lives and public 
decisionmaking 
israels extreme securityconsciousness and the distrust of the 
outside world both byproducts of the holocaust are embodied in 
politicians like rightwing prime minister yitzhak shamir born 
yitzhak ysernitzky 74 years ago in ruzinoy poland 
shamirs father shlomo a jewish community leader escaped from 
a train bound for a nazi death camp and sought shelter in a nearby 
village 
while seeking shelter among friends in the village where he 
grew up they his friends from childhood killed him shamir 
recalled bitterly at a remembrance ceremony this year 
it shaped the thinking of many top military leaders such as 
peled 
i am sure that whenever a leader has to make a decision our 
background our terrible background is in his mind peled 49 
said in an interview with the associated press 
peled born jefke mendelevitch in belgium was hidden with a 
christian family in antwerp before his parents were deported to the 
auschwitz death camp at auschwitz peled said his father was 
killed and his mother was destroyed as a person 
the holocaust in which 6 million jews died left peled 
hypersensitive about the treatment of children to the point where 
he told friends he would have to leave their house if they could 
not stop their babys crying 
partly as a result of this background peled said he has clashed 
with israeliallied lebanese militiamen in south lebanon when they 
have wanted to use artillery to shell civilian villages 
hundreds of times i have put limits on operational activities 
to try not to hurt innocent people and of course children he 
said 
about 300000 israelis who survived the death camps and 
persecution still suffer directly and psychological studies 
indicate the side effects have been passed on to a second 
generation of victims the 800000 children of suvivors 
billy laniado head of the second generation society that 
represents 1200 survivors children said the holocaust still has 
a pervasive influence in israel 
even though we look strong and sometimes appear even rude in 
some ways we still feel very vulnerable she said 
in psychologia magazine three army psychologists wrote in 
november that based on a study of 212 soldiers who suffered shell 
shock in the lebanon war the sons of holocaust victims were more 
susceptible to stress and took longer to recover than a control 
group 
the second generation was raised to correct the damage the 
holocaust caused their parents the level of expectation increases 
pressure on the battlefield but also the feeling of failure in a 
soldier who breaks down and suffers from battle shock wrote 
zahava solomon moshe kotler and mario mikulincer 
rabbi menachem fogel of the yad vashem holocaust memorial said 
in an interview the holocaust is losing force but it is still 
something very vivid and potent and overwhelming in the lives of 
those who lived through it 
the feeling that there is a real threat of annihilation even 
today is part of our national psyche he said 
the holocaust has deeply influenced israeli politics but in 
different ways 
for example the left is constantly on guard against human 
rights violations and the right is obsessed with security 
one lesson is that you learn to protect your own against any 
possible threat you also learn from the holocaust that you cannot 
persecute people because your own peoples persecution has been so 
traumatic fogel said 
yehudit richter a tel aviv university sociologist whose father 
was subjected to cruel experiments by nazi doctor joseph mengele 
said the outlook about what to do with the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip is entangled in the holocaust experience 
my parents feel that while we have the territories we are 
strong and they dont want to give them away she said 
but ms richter and other israelis recoil from statements by 
palestinian activists who often liken the measures used by israeli 
soldiers fighting the palestinian uprising to those of the nazis 
this is really enraging she said this palestinian 
uprising is not a question of existence there is no concept of 
total destruction or wiping a people from the face of the earth

after emerging as the worlds most vibrant 
region in the 1980s asia faces the tricky task of maintaining its 
doubletime march toward prosperity while grappling with a 
potential crisis of leadership in the new decade 
political stars of the 1980s such as deng xiaoping in china and 
corazon aquino in the philippines may soon leave the world stage 
with their work in danger of unraveling 
other stories to watch for in the coming decade will be the 
economic emergence of vietnam greater regional cooperation in 
asia and the fate of hong kong as it switches from british to 
chinese sovereignty 
asia has plenty to be proud of as the 1980s draw to a close 
japan has the worlds no 2 economy after the united states and 
the four little dragons south korea taiwan hong kong and 
singapore have seen dizzying exportled growth that has averaged 
9 percent annually in the past generation 
further economic growth seems assured for japan a large pool of 
capital for investment in factory expansion already has the united 
states bracing for a new japanese export wave 
much of japans plant and equipment investment is going into new 
technology product development and laborsaving automation 
according to fuji research institute corp ensuring japan will 
remain highly competitive 
but fuji also predicts that as the united states continues to 
demand japan open its markets there is a strong possibility that 
the trade surplus will gradually shrink over the next three or 
four years 
if that happens the institute said economic friction between 
the two giants could focus on japanese investment in the united 
states sony corps takeover of columbia pictures and the purchase 
of rockefeller center in new york by mitsubishi estate co already 
have raised eyebrows 
the little dragons also want continued growth but know that 
their economic formula for the 1980s is outdated rising wages mean 
that laborintensive lowtechnology factories must give way to 
more advanced industry 
in taiwan for example shoe and textile plants are being 
replaced by factories making computer chips and other 
hightechnology components 
the regions basic manufacturing base has begun to shift toward 
southeast asia where a second generation of little dragons is 
coming to life with cheap and plentiful labor 
thailand has become the regions most dynamic economy according 
to miron mushkat chief regional economist for baring securities 
ltd of hong kong annual growth rates are expected to continue for 
at least several more years in the 5 percent to 10 percent region 
much of the capital fueling growth in southeast asia is from 
cashrich japan and taiwan which have billions of dollars to burn 
japanese aid to thailand for example was 859 million last 
year up from 48 million in 1985 
and the philippines is risking diplomatic trouble with china by 
courting business from beijings political rival taiwan which 
invested 123 million in the first half of 1989 up onefourth from 
the same period a year earlier 
as southeast asia develops all eyes will be on vietnam which 
could become the continents next economic frontier with vietnams 
announced pullout of its troops from cambodia western aid and 
investment could soon pour into what has been one of the worlds 
most impoverished economies 
vietnam will take off in a flurry once the united states 
drops its trade embargo says robert broadfoot managing director 
of hong kongbased risk consultancy ltd 
foreign businessmen now fly into the communist nation each day 
as a possible sign of things to come vietnam has emerged this year 
as the worlds third largest exporter of rice after thailand and 
the united states 
markets for vietnam and other expanding asian economies will 
increasingly be within the region particularly if europe becomes a 
more difficult trade partner after the common market unifies in 
1992 
that has triggered talk about increased regional cooperation 
foreign and trade ministers from 12 pacific rim countries 
including the united states met in australia in november to 
discuss the issue 
we now see conditions ripening for cooperation as the 
prospect of economic advance provides positive incentives for 
collaboration richard h solomon assistant secretary of state 
for east asian and pacific affairs recently told a hong kong 
audience 
the ministers meeting agreed to act in concert to secure 
international trade reforms but ruled out formation of an asian 
pacific trading bloc to counter restrictions that may come from the 
european market 
experts now envision development of a regional forum perhaps at 
the ministerial level under which asian nations could issue 
general statements or consult with each other in times of crisis 
greater cooperation may not be feasible asia is very 
fragmented it lacks strong political leadership needed to 
sustain and galvanize a regional movement explains mushkat 
perhaps the greatest challenge facing asia in the 1990s is a 
potential crisis of national leadership 
nowhere is this more obvious than in china where jockeying has 
already begun to head the postdeng xiaoping era 
deng 85 recently retired from his last communist party post 
and has been trying to rally support around party chief jiang zemin 
as his heir apparent but jiangs power base remains weak and it is 
not clear who will rule once deng dies 
no matter who governs chinas 11 billion people in the 1990s 
they will face enormous obstacles such as corruption rising 
unemployment and lack of raw materials and energy 
they also will have to contend with aspirations for political 
change that exploded during the spring prodemocracy movement but 
were crushed at least temporarily by the military crackdown

the future of dengs decade of marketoriented economic reforms 
under which chinas economy staged a remarkable recovery after the 
ruinous 196676 cultural revolution is particularly murky 
to get rich is glorious was the phrase that moved the masses 
in the 1980s but it has fallen out of favor with the ascendancy 
this year of ideological hardliners 
if conservatives such as premier li peng win the power struggle 
the opendoor policy would slow and more emphasis would be placed 
on central planning which would be bitterly opposed by coastal 
regions that prospered greatly during dengs reforms 
chinas uncertain future was summed up recently by us 
ambassador to beijing james lilley who said it may be some 
years before we can put a name or theme to the new chapter china 
will write in the 1990s in the meantime we must be prepared for 
twists and turns that may defy attempts at labeling 
a crisis also could occur in the philippines a fledgling 
democracy where president corazon aquino has said she will not seek 
reelection when her term expires in 1992 no strong candidate has 
emerged as her heir apparent on the politically fractured 
archipelago 
singapores president lee kuan yew malaysias prime minister 
mahathir mohamad and indonesias president suharto are strong 
leaders who also may leave the scene in the coming years 
every leader but one will change in the region said 
broadfoot he expects only the sultan of brunei to still be in 
power at the turn of the century 
one territory that is almost assured of a rough decade is hong 
kong which britain will hand over to china in 1997 
fewer and fewer of the colonys 57 million people have faith in 
communist chinas promise that hong kong can maintain its 
capitalist lifestyle for 50 years and enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy particularly since the suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing 
huge numbers of people uncertain about the future are emigrating 
from hong kong a foreign passport is the most prized possession in 
the colony and residents are sparing no effort to secure one 
marriage counselors report booming business from people desperately 
seeking foreign national spouses 
the government in estimates often criticized as too 
conservative believes 42000 people will emigrate in 1989 and 
another 55000 will leave the following year 
many highly educated whitecollar workers are among those 
leaving leading to a brain drain that could reduce the territorys 
economic competitiveness 
adding to the territorys headache are the approximately 57000 
vietnamese boat people who have sailed to hong kong seeking asylum 
the squalid camps in which they are housed could erupt in violence 
if the government carries through plans to send most of them back 
to their homeland against their will 
two of the other little dragons taiwan and south korea 
show promise for furthering what mushkat calls the slow and 
painful process of democratic change in asia which has a long 
history of authoritarian rule 
for example the ruling nationalist party is slowly giving up 
its monopoly on political power in taiwan 
democratization shall not move backward in taiwan unless the 
economy collapses or in case of a war neither of which looks very 
likely said lu yali a political commentator at national taiwan 
university 
but taiwan may experience some social instability because of a 
problem also faced by south korea and japan a population that has 
not seen its standard of living increase as quickly as national 
wealth 
property prices have skyrocketed in taiwan and most 
middleclass families have lost all chance of buying their own 
homes crime has increased to the point where sales of luxury 
foreign cars have fallen sharply because businessmen say the 
vehicles make them targets of blackmail 
in japan the average person lives in cramped housing suffers a 
long commute through congested traffic and pays prices 20 percent 
to 30 percent higher than in other industrial nations 
says broadfoot youll see a much greater emphasis on quality 
of life in northeast asia during the 1990s 
in southeast asia the 1990s will begin with a number of thorny 
security issues including the cambodian civil war in which the 
genocidal khmer rouge is among several groups fighting for power 
washington will be negotiating the future of six us military 
bases on the philippines whose lease expires in 1991 many 
influential politicians oppose the bases and there has been some 
indication of growing sentiment in the philippines armed forces 
against the us facilities 
but perhaps the most interesting security question will be what 
tokyo does to protect its growing economic interests in the region 
broadfoot sees japan likely flexing greater military strength 
i dont think the united states will be able to continue to be 
the defense umbrella of asia to the extent that it has been he 
said 
a stronger japanese military will undoubtedly rekindle painful 
memories throughout the region of tokyos efforts to carve a 
subservient great east asia coprosperity sphere during the world 
war ii era 
japan may choose to protect its investment through the use of 
foreign aid designed to promote stability in the region but that 
could help create a zone of influence that also could lead to 
antijapanese sentiment

solider and adventurer who lived in the 18th century he also was a 
master prevaricator whose tales would make paul bunyons munchkin 
size 
terry gilliam a founding member of the irreverent monty python 
troupe has taken this legendary liar and made the adventures of 
baron munchausen the third in his fantasy triology that includes 
time bandits and brazil but where time bandits 
primarily had a comedic appeal to youngsters and brazil tapped 
more philosophical and political chords baron munchausen is a 
priceless romp with more visual effects and excursions into pure 
fantasy than any movie in memory theres even an unbilled cameo by 
robin williams as the king of the moon 
the story opens in late 18th century the age of reason 
wednesday with an attack on an ancient city by the ferocious 
forces of the ottoman empire a play about the baron is under way 
at a local theater but the real baron is in the audience and takes 
issue with the mockery on stage 
the movie soon becomes the barons story and the spectacle is 
nonstop a hotair trip in a balloon made of ladies knickers that 
takes the baron john neville and sally salt sarah polley a 
little girl who believes in imagination to the moon and heaven 
heads that separate from bodies a venus rising from a halfshell 
complete with little angels with little wings sea monsters 
strange trees creatures 
but theres so much more in gilliams odyssey the film is a 
wondrous and brilliant work whose underpinnings tap the very 
essence of imagination and conformity the rigid bureaucrat horatio 
jackson jonathan pryce questions the place of fancy imagination 
and dreamers in the age of reason there isnt one he says 
fairy tales however never die 
charles mckeown who also has the dual role of rupert and

offprice retailers are poised to take advantage 
of the annual search for holiday gifts that wont bust personal 
budgets 
they say their practice of seizing opportunities to buy 
attractively priced merchandise from manufacturers has enabled them 
to broaden their selections putting them in an especially strong 
position to compete for customer dollars this christmas 
we have found quite an abundance of terrific merchandise in 
the marketplace steven wishner vice president and treasurer of 
retailer tjx cos inc said monday 
there have been more chances for them to get good buys this 
autumn in some cases apparel suppliers that balked at shipping to 
department store chains owned by financially troubled campeau corp 
worried that the cashneedy parent company would be slow in 
paying opted to unload their goods with offprice outlets 
manufacturers are much more interested in working with the 
offpricers than ever before said jane maxwell a spokeswoman 
for marshalls the nations biggest offprice chain 
when an opportunity became available we were there to buy we 
were very well poised to take advantage of anything that did come 
up she said when a big department store cancels an order 
were right there to pick it up 
marshalls an andover massbased unit of melville corp and 
other offprice merchants sell national brands of clothing and 
designer labels at significantly smaller markups than department 
stores specialty retailers and other conventional fullprice 
retailers 
in contrast discounters such as k mart and the target division 
of dayton hudson corp mainly carry their own private labels of 
apparel or lesserknown brands sometimes with a limited selection 
of national names at reduced prices 
the fight for market share between conventional retailers and 
offpricers always is fierce particularly during the holiday 
shopping season which can account for more than half of a 
retailers annual profit at the peak spending season shoppers who 
normally dont patronize offprice stores may do so in an effort to 
stay within their budgets especially during slow economic growth 
the battle lines have blurred lately because regular retailers 
are relying heavily on price cuts to boost traffic and capitalize 
on the seasonal surge in spending a tactic industry analysts think 
is a must if stores hope to woo reluctant consumers 
we are expecting a restrained shopping climate to prevail in 
which people will be very very thoughtful about the way they spend 
money and will look for incentives before making a purchase said 
retail consultant kurt barnard 
meanwhile offprice chains are touting their expanded offerings 
and their consistently lower prices in hopes of winning a larger 
following 
marshalls has been pushing key items aggressively through 
television and radio spots designer jogging suits plus ladies 
sweaters and silk blouses recently have been featured in marshalls 
ads 
wishner said tjx has been running special advertisements to 
highlight its merchandise and its tj maxx stores are winding down 
a 10day promotional blitz besides its 337 tj maxx stores 
framingham massbased tjx owns 534 hit or miss womens clothing 
stores and chadwicks of boston a womens offprice fashion mail 
order catalog 
rather than hurting the offprice chains the sporadic 
discounting at department stores over the past several months has 
played into the hands of these retailers 
it has not worked to our disadvantage said ms maxwell of 
marshalls she said consumers are getting confused about what is a 
fair price by slashing prices department stores have given the 
impression that their prices were too high in the first place 
burlington coat factory warehouse corp one of the countrys 
largest outerwear retailers that also has extensive mens womens 
and childrens clothing departments picked up merchandise from 
vendors with whom it normally didnt do much business 
robert lapenta chief financial officer of the burlington 
njbased company said in the past suppliers waited to fill 
burlington orders until after they had satisfied department store 
customers this year vendors have been more willing to supply 
burlington early 
we were there for them lapenta said we think that is 
going to help us into the future this might be the opportunity to 
develop some relationships that can carry us into the 90s 
for this year offprice chains hope they will have an edge over 
their fullprice competitors by being better stocked to meet demand 
we hear that the department stores dont have the goods to do 
the business through the season lapenta said we definitely 
have the inventory

the biggest stumbling block to normalizing 
trade between the united states and the soviet union has been a 
15yearold amendment added to the 1974 trade act 
sponsored by the late sen henry jackson dwash and former 
rep charles a vanik dohio the legislation prohibits communist 
countries from receiving favorable tariff treatment from the united 
states unless they permit free emigration by their citizens 
the amendment has meant that the soviet union cannot qualify for 
mostfavorednation status or the low tariffs that govern us 
trade with 150 nations instead soviet goods are taxed at rates as 
much as 10 times higher than the duties paid by other countries 
president bush said last may that he would recommend that 
congress grant a waiver of the jacksonvanik requirements once the 
soviet parliament passed a liberalized emigration law and 
demonstrated good faith in implementing the law 
such a law is pending before the supreme soviet and bush is 
expected to act promptly upon final passage of the measure since 
the soviets in an effort to demonstrate good faith have already 
allowed more than 50000 jews to leave the country this year 
for one product alone the soviets estimate that the lower 
tariffs will reduce the cost of a case of vodka in the united 
states by 15

georgiapacific corp wants shareholders 
of great northern nekoosa corp to vote quickly on an unsolicited 
36 billion tender offer for the paper company while considering 
the removal of great northerns directors 
great northern which has refused to negotiate with 
georgiapacific promised a vigorous defense to the new attack 
the latest round in the dispute came monday as georgiapacific 
filed more papers in federal court seeking a shareholder vote on 
the buyout offer within weeks instead of months georgiapacific 
also announced it would run advertisements asking shareholders to 
demand a special meeting at which the great northern executives 
could be ousted 
its clearly time to let great northerns shareholders speak 
for themselves since their board obviously does not speak for 
them georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr said in a 
statement released by his atlanta headquarters 
in papers filed in us district court georgiapacific asked 
for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that 
would force a great northern shareholder meeting to be moved up 
from march 20 to sometime within the next 30 days for a vote on the 
tender offer 
georgiapacific also seeks to force great northern to disclose 
to the securities and exchange commission any steps it might be 
taking to alter its financial structure to make a takeover more 
difficult 
great northern based in norwalk conn but incorporated in 
maine called georgiapacifics motion entirely meritless and 
an effort to divert attention from the illegal and illconceived 
nature of georgiapacifics takeover effort 
in essence georgiapacific is asking the court to give 
shareowners less time to consider the merits of each sides 
position great northern spokesman stephen m hill said in a 
statement 
great northern has refused to negotiate with georgiapacific 
since it made a tender offer of 58 per share last month then 
raised the offer to 63 per share this month great northern said 
the offer would not be good for shareholders and that it would 
violate antitrust laws 
georgiapacific spokeswoman gail smith said that under maine 
law if at least onethird of the shareholders request a special 
meeting for voting on removal of the directors the meeting must be 
called within 60 days 
hill said his company had not seen a copy of georgiapacifics 
request for any such meeting and so he had no immediate comment 
hahn was to meet in augusta today with gov john r mckernan and 
attorney general james e tierney in separate sessions 
maine officials have sought assurances from both companies that 
any merger would not cost any state residents their jobs or put 
valuable woodlands in the hands of developers 
hahn has balked at making any promises saying that since he 
does not have access to great northerns inside information on its 
maine holdings he cannot say for sure what georgiapacific will do 
if it wins the takeover battle

car and light truck sales remained weak in 
midnovember down 44 percent compared with the same time last 
year making extended manufacturing layoffs around christmas a 
growing possibility analysts said 
the eight major automakers with us assembly plants said monday 
they sold vehicles at an average rate of 31032 a day during the 
nov 1120 period this year compared with a daily pace of 32466 
vehicles during the same time last year 
car sales slumped 61 percent and light truck sales declined 18 
percent for the period 
the decline may seem small compared with some doubledigit 
tumbles a few weeks ago but a large percentage of the cars being 
sold now are going to fleets such as rental car companies and large 
corporations said analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co in 
new york 
about 40 percent of the sales in the first 50 days of a 
model year are fleet sales kirnan said it basically means 
that the individual has not been in the market 
come the first quarter of 1990 well have a better sense of 
whether the market is really as weak as we may be seeing now he 
said 
between now and then automakers are likely to shy away from 
largescale increases in their incentive programs opting instead 
for longer christmas and new year holiday shutdowns to help control 
new car inventories analysts said 
i think they are finding the incentives didnt work so they 
are cutting back production said analyst mary anne sudol of 
fitch investors service inc in new york 
during the first nine months of this year automakers shuffled 
incentive packages at a nearly dizzying pace but by the time the 
1990 models began appearing in showrooms in october many of the 
incentive packages had been trimmed for the new cars 
contributing to the sales decline were higher prices for the 
1990 models due in large part the companies said to such 
governmentmandated safety devices as driverside air bags and 
automatic seat belts 
the double wallop of higher prices and lower incentives pushed 
consumers into buying 1989 models in august and september analysts 
and company officials have said 
the sales numbers reported monday were not surprising kirnan 
said 
the industry has anticipated the weakness in the present 
quarter because of what happened in the summer the big blowout 
sales and consumers taking advantage of the pricing on the 89 
models he said 
through nov 20 car and truck sales from manufacturers with 
us plants were 26 percent behind last years pace car sales 
were down 36 percent and truck sales were off 08 percent 
ford motor co said sales of its vehicles were down 13 percent 
in midnovember with car sales falling 116 percent and truck 
sales off 148 percent for the year fords vehicle sales were 
down 25 percent 
chrysler corps cars and trucks sold at a pace 33 percent 
slower in midnovember this year compared with the same time last 
year a 12 percent drop in its car sales was offset by a 6 percent 
increase in its light truck sales 
chryslers yeartodate car and truck sales were 64 percent 
behind last year 
general motors corp said its midnovember car sales were down 
13 percent while its truck sales were up 41 percent combining for 
a 73 percent decline for its vehicles during the period for the 
year gms car and truck sales were down 5 percent from last year

the european community commission says 
it has signed a trade and economic cooperation accord with the 
soviet union that goes beyond similar deals signed in the past 14 
months with hungary poland and czechoslovakia 
the pact provides for a gradual lifting of import quotas on 
soviet industrial goods by 1995 and cites a dozen areas in which 
the two sides plan to establish economic cooperation an ec source 
said monday 
these include science and technology banking transport 
agriculture environmental protection energy raw materials and 
mining the accord excludes trade in goods considered to be 
sensitive militarily according to the source who asked not to be 
identified 
he said the agreement calls for reciprocity in trade benefits 
that is the objective of this accord to get an effective 
access to the russian market for ec products the source said 
officials could not give an assessment of the economic impact of 
the agreement 
ec trade with eastern europe is small it totaled 56 billion in 
1987 the last year for which complete figures are available 
ecsoviet trade that year was only 246 billion 
the agreement with moscow was reached after five days of talks 
between ec commission and soviet negotiators it must be approved 
by the 12 ec states and the european parliament 
that is a formality however given the ecs interest in 
increasing economic links with eastern europe and getting access to 
its market of 390 million consumers 
the soviet accord negotiated in about four months is the 
fourth the ec has signed with an east european nation in just over 
a year 
it signed a trade and economic cooperation agreement with 
hungary in september 1988 a more limited deal with czechoslovakia 
covering only trade in manufactured goods was signed in december 
1988 and an agreement with poland was signed sept 19 
these accords follow a june 25 1988 agreement under which the 
ec and the moscowled comecon trade bloc after years of ignoring 
one another signed a mutual recognition agreement in luxembourg 
the ec on monday also widened market access for farm and textile 
goods from poland and hungary through the measure which will be 
in effect only during 1990 the ec suspended import quotas for the 
two countries that are fixed through the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the world trade body 
in a statement the 12 ec foreign ministers said the oneyear 
lifting of quotas was an exceptional solution to an exceptional 
problem and represents no change in the ecs overall position on 
quotas in world trade 
the move follows an ec decision nov 6 to increase market access 
for industrial goods from poland and hungary 
the ec foreign ministers were notified of the agreement with the 
soviet union but did not discuss the issue in depth 
the soviet accord goes further than any other deal the ec has 
signed with an east european nation notably by subjecting nuclear 
energy safety and mining to economic cooperation sources said 
also on monday european community external relations 
commissioner frans andriessen called developments in czechoslovakia 
of the last week a cause for profound rejoicing throughout 
europe 
political reform and economic liberalization in czechoslovakia 
fom part of a wider process which for the first time in more than 
40 years offers to future generations the prospect of a europe no 
longer riven by division he said 
ec officials said it was too early to speak of a widening of the 
accord with czechoslovakia 
the commission is still negotiating trade and economic 
cooperation agreements with bulgaria and east germany talks with 
east germany are in an exploratory stage but will likely be 
speeded up by next weeks visit to east berlin by andriessen 
east germany has asked the ec for an accord on trade and 
economic cooperation the ec has broken off talks for closer 
economic ties with romania in view of its human rights record

the biggest single revenueraiser in the new 
deficit reduction agreement will sharply limit employers ability 
to use taxes withheld from workers checks before turning the money 
over to the treasury 
the legislation on president bushs desk would reduce to one day 
from as many as seven days the grace period allowed before 
large employers have to deposit withheld taxes 
congressional economists estimate the change which takes effect 
aug 1 would save the government 245 billion in the last two 
months of the budget year ending sept 30 thats more than twice 
the size of the nextlargest revenue increase in the bill 
two far smaller parts of the bill also rely on accelerating tax 
collections one affects the airline industry which collects the 8 
percent tax on passenger tickets the other requires gasoline 
wholesalers to make quicker payments of the 91centagallon 
gasoline tax 
the idea is that somebody is collecting a tax for the 
government and the issue is how quickly they should deposit it into 
the federal coffers said sam starr a partner in the washington 
office of coopers amp lybrand accountants 
the payrolltax change will affect only those employers that 
have collected more than 100000 of social security and income 
taxes in a given period 
thats not going to hit the momandpop operations starr 
said perhaps those with 100 or 200 employees may be affected 
david burton a tax specialist with the us chamber of 
commerce sees the change becoming a burden for medium and larger 
companies especially those that have more than one plant or outlet 
obviously they will be denied a small float the temporary 
use of withheld taxes burton said but the problem comes because 
they will be forced to make deposits before they can calculate how 
much they really owe 
burton said many companies with multiple outlets will have to 
make the federal tax deposit a day or two before they can collect 
records of how many hours were worked during the pay period or 
exactly how many people were on the payroll 
under present law a month is divided into eight deposit periods 
of three or four days each in general an employer has three 
banking days to make a deposit if at the end of any of those 
periods the company has undeposited taxes of 3000 or more 
under the bill an employer would have to make a deposit the 
next banking day regardless of where that fell in the eight 
deposit periods after collected taxes totaled more than 100000 
the bill applies to income taxes and social security taxes 
withheld from workers checks as well as to an employers matching 
share of social security taxes 
a company with 200 workers averaging 20000 a year would not be 
affected by the new rule however one with 250 employees at the 
same average would be hit assuming the workers had income taxes 
withheld at a 15 percent rate the combined employeremployee 
social security tax rate next year will be 153 percent 
burton sees this years legislation as the nose under the 
tent the next time congress is looking for a painless 
revenueraiser he predicts the lawmakers will cut the 100000 
threshold and eventually its going to get down to the really 
small employer

the united states and the soviet union are on 
the verge of reviving normal trade relations as their leaders meet 
in this weekends summit though it could be years before trading 
practices catch up with the political changes sweeping the 
communist bloc 
trade between the two superpowers will be a primary topic of 
discussion at the mediterranean shipboard summit meeting between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
for its part the administration hopes that strengthening 
ussoviet trade ties will provide american support for 
gorbachevs economic restructuring known as perestroika 
there is no doubt that the soviet economy and gorbachevs 
restructuring efforts are in need of a boost with winter 
approaching the soviets are plagued by strikes and severe 
shortages of many consumer items 
so far bush has stopped far short of any bold package of 
measures aimed at promoting extensive eastwest economic links 
although the administration has given endorsement to gorbachevs 
economic reforms and offered us economists to supply technical 
assistance to the soviets 
one announcement bush is expected to make at the summit or soon 
after is a proposed waiver of the high tariffs that have been 
imposed on imports of soviet goods into the united states for the 
past 15 years 
those tariffs which carry duties as much as 10 times higher 
than on imports from other countries are a result of legislation 
passed by congress in 1974 known as the jacksonvanik amendment 
that law says communist countries may not receive favorable 
tariff treatment from the united states unless they permit free 
emigration of their citizens 
last may bush announced that he would ask congress to remove 
the soviet union from the jacksonvanik restriction if the soviet 
union liberalized its emigration policies 
the supreme soviet is debating legislation that would 
essentially put into law what has already been occurring in the 
soviet union more than 50000 jews have left the country this year 
the soviets hope that removal of the tariffs will make their 
products more attractive to american consumers but bush 
administration officials caution against expecting too much in the 
way of expanded trade at least in the near term 
it will be up to their private sector to create tradable 
items us trade representative carla hills said in an 
interview they have a number of items that are tradable on the 
world market a lot of them come out of the ground oil and ores 
however just last week the soviet government faced with 
serious shortages announced new restrictions on exports of goods 
in short supply at home because of the problems the soviets are 
facing producing enough for domestic consumption us economists 
question how much production they can divert to exports 
but economists do see trade opportunities for the west in 
supplying products to soviet consumers many of whom have won hefty 
wage increases under perestroika but have little chance to spend 
their extra rubles in depleted stores 
the soviet government trying to quell consumer unhappiness has 
spent 16 billion this year on emergency imports of such everyday 
items as razor blades and shaving cream 
you are looking at a potentially huge market said commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher who led the us delegation during 
november trade negotiations with the soviets 
the soviet union is one of a handful of countries with which the 
united states enjoys a trade surplus through september this year 
us export sales to the soviet union primarily agricultural 
products amounted to 322 billion while soviet sales to america 
have totaled 555 million giving the united states a surplus in 
the twoway trade of 266 billion 
the prospect of expanded trade with the soviets is exciting to 
american farm groups in particular before president carter imposed 
a grain embargo in retaliation for the soviet invasion of 
afghanistan america supplied almost 80 percent of soviet grain 
imports a new longterm grain agreement is being negotiated 
the soviet union has been promoting western joint ventures as a 
key part of gorbachevs efforts to attract foreign investment to 
modernize soviet industry 
since january 1987 more than 1000 agreements with western 
companies have been signed but so far only about 10 percent have 
been implemented 
theodore cooper head of upjohn the giant pharmaceutical 
company said his company is already doing research in the soviet 
union and is exploring the possibility of a joint venture to 
manufacture drugs there but cooper said there are many hurdles to 
overcome including the fact that the soviet ruble is not easily 
convertible to other currencies 
getting your money out is always a challenge and the 
instabilities and the uncertainties have always made the 
opportunities seem difficult he said 
the bush administration has working groups exploring a proposed 
new trade treaty with the soviet union to replace one that moscow 
nullified in 1975 after the jacksonvanik tariff hikes went into 
effect 
the working groups are also exploring such issues as investments 
and tax treatment for us companies doing business in the soviet 
union 
the administration has already said that moscow will not be 
getting some items on its wish list mosbacher said the 
administration was not in favor of granting admission at this time 
for the soviets in the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
governing body for world trade 
the us government has also been cool to lowering barriers to 
trade in hightechnology items which could be used for military 
purposes though the administration is receiving heavy pressure 
from its west european allies to ease that stance

the end of the line may be near for the 
104yearold miller amp rhoads department store chain which has 
abandoned a plan to reorganize under bankruptcy law and says it 
wants to sell all its assets 
if miller amp rhoads cannot continue as a viable retail entity 
then its best that this action be taken president john e 
stokely told a news conference monday at the companys flagship 
store in downtown richmond 
stokely said the richmondbased chain had filed a plan earlier 
in the afternoon in us bankruptcy court that contemplates the 
sale of all assets 
miller amp rhoads had 14 stores in july when it filed for 
protection from its creditors to enable it to reorganize under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy code the company has since begun 
arrangements to rid itself of six of its less profitable stores 
the companys current circumstances and financial condition 
led the board of directors to conclude that a reorganization as a 
profitable going concern is not feasible stokely said 
he said negotiations are continuing to sell four of the eight 
remaining outlets to may department stores co of st louis may 
which operates 14 department store chains around the country is 
interested in miller amp rhoads stores at lynnhaven mall in virginia 
beach greenbrier mall in chesapeake and chesterfield and regency 
malls in suburban richmond he said 
the nature of these negotiations is such that they could be 
consummated tomorrow next week or never he said 
hechts a department store chain owned by may planned to hold 
a news conference today in washington but stokely said he did not 
know if the subject would involve a possible purchase of miller amp 
rhoads stores 
stokely estimated it would take four to six months to complete 
the sale of all miller amp rhoads assets and said none of the sales 
transactions would be completed before the end of january 
the chain will operate normally through the christmas season 
stokely said 
all customer services will remain intact including 
afterchristmas returns and refunds he said 
stokely said factors affecting miller amp rhoads decision to sell 
its assets included a weakness in the retail industry inventory 
levels financing and the companys debt level 
im disappointed certainly everybody in the company is 
disappointed he said 
he said jobs should be available to the majority of the 
companys approximately 2000 employees through the sale of the 
chains properties to other retailers

women are being laid off and poorly treated under 
current state efforts to streamline workforces in factories 
according to a survey by the china womens journal 
the survey of northeast chinas liaoning province found that 
many women are being laid off by factories that consider them 
surplus or redundant the journal said in a report carried by the 
official china daily on tuesday 
it said women were the victims of optimum reorganization of 
the labor force chinas euphemism for laying off workers 
very few people are ever fired in the nations staterun 
enterprises and laidoff workers usually receive their base pay 
however only 45 percent of laidoff women continue to get 
bonuses a substantial part of incomes and welfare benefits 
a investigation made earlier this year by the allchina national 
labor force commission found that enterprises considered 20 percent 
of their employees to be surplus or redundant and 64 percent of 
them were women women make up about 37 percent of the urban 
workforce 
many enterprises are also now refusing to hire women because 
maternity leaves and early retirements drive up welfare costs

chevron corps creation of a leveraged 
employee stock ownership plan will likely decrease the chances of a 
takeover of the oil giant analysts say 
it improves the companys defenses said rosario ilacqua an 
analyst with new yorkbased nikko securities in a real showdown 
with someone they employees will vote for their management rather 
than with someone from without people are afraid they will lose 
their jobs 
the announcement of the esop plan on monday follows weeks of 
speculation that chevron is ripe for takeover possibly by pennzoil 
co 
but a spokesman for chevron the worlds sixth largest oil 
company and the nations largest petroleum refiner denied the move 
was intended to thwart a possible takeover 
we did not do this as a defensive measure we have been 
examining the feasibility of an esop since april when we created a 
task force to look into it said spokesman larry shushan he 
declined to comment on takeover rumors 
he said the program was created as a lowcost means of paying 
for part of employee benefits 
shushan said the company had put the idea on hold until congress 
last week passed legislation preserving the tax deduction on 
dividends paid by a corporation on shares held by such a plan 
the plan will eventually place 16 percent of the oil companys 
stock in the ownership of its employees it envisions an employee 
trust spending 1 billion to add about 5 percent of chevrons 342 
million shares to the 11 percent already held by the companys 
profitsharing plan 
under the esop which will be part of chevrons profit 
sharingsavings plan the company will sell stock to its employees 
and then buy a comparable amount on the open market chevrons 
profit sharing plan holds about 11 percent of the companys 
outstanding stock 
the esop trust will borrow 1 billion from banks and use the 
money to buy newly issued shares of chevron common stock from the 
corporation 
the new shares which are about 5 percent of chevrons 342 
million outstanding shares will be held by the leveraged esop 
trust the company said they will be allocated to employee 
accounts in may when chevron makes its profit sharing distribution 
for the first quarter of 1990 to nonunion employees the plan 
will be offered to union workers through the collective bargaining 
process shushan said 
chevrons stock closed monday at 68 per share on the new york 
stock exchange up 3 the stock has sold as high as 69 in recent 
weeks 
analysts said the rise in chevron stock since takeover 
speculation began is not surprising since the stock has been 
undervalued in recent years chevrons stock has risen about 48 
percent this year 
chevron rich in oil and gas reserves and a highperforming 
chemicals unit had sales in 1988 of 289 billion down from 291 
billion in 1987 earnings last year totaled 18 billion or 517 
a share up about 40 percent from 13 billion or 365 a share 
some analysts say that in a breakup chevrons assets could be 
worth 100 to 125 a share or about 40 billion 
a published report monday suggested that a group of investors 
could be acting in concert to force chevron into a restructuring 
that would boost the stock further 
a buyer possibly a company acting alone or with partners has 
reportedly accumulated 12 million to 16 million shares of chevron 
stock or 35 percent to 47 percent according to usa today 
shushan declined to comment on the stocks purchaser in accordance 
with company policy 
pennzoil also declined to comment but the houstonbased oil 
company is rumored to be looking for a place to park some 25 
billion in cash that it received in a 1988 settlement with texaco 
inc following a prolonged battle over getty oil co

opec ministers said today they reached a new 
production agreement that would raise the groups output ceiling to 
22 million barrels a day and maintain a target price of 18 a 
barrel 
all 13 members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries would sign the agreement at its vienna secretariat later 
in the day ministers said as they broke up a main bargaining 
session in a hotel 
how the increase would be allocated wasnt immediately known 
the cartel likely would issue a communique after the agreement was 
signed 
opecs daily ceiling for the fourth quarter is 205 million 
barrels but analysts say it is producing more than 23 million 
barrels with kuwait and the united arab emirates cheating on their 
quotas 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh confirmed a deal was 
reached and that the new ceiling would be 22 million barrels a day 
venezuelan minister celestino armas confirmed that all the 
members agreed to the pact 
hisham nazer saudi arabias oil minister nodded yes when asked 
if the target price would be 18 a barrel its current level 
the ministers overcame their differences on the fourth day of 
their regular winter conference to reach an agreement for the first 
half of 1990 
they had struggled with demands from kuwait and the united arab 
emirates for bigger portions of the production 
it was doubtful the united arab emirates would abide by any 
quota agreed to tuesday it and kuwait have been producing 2 
million barrels a day each or double their current quotas 
earlier sources who demanded anonymity said the tentative 
plan was for indonesia and venezuela to relinquish portions of 
their shares so that kuwait could get the bigger percentage it 
wants 
the united arab emirates perhaps would be allowed to produce 
what it wants sources said the other members would get to pump 
more oil but their shares of the total would remain the same they 
said 
libya and algeria in particular had balked at the plan sources 
said 
speaking of the sources outline steve turner an oil analyst 
with the london investment firm smith new court said i think 
its a very weak agreement 
such a deal would result in opec allowing production of around 
24 million barrels a day more than it is producing in violation of 
its current ceiling 
turner estimates demand of 215 million barrels a day in the 
first have of 1990 
so it look as though opec is going to be producing 
substantially in excess of the markets needs turner said in 
that scenario the oil price would be under continued downward 
pressure 
recently oil prices have been surprisingly strong in face of 
overproduction by opec and are trading at levels 50 percent above 
a year ago 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil was trading at a spot price of 1825 a barrel tuesday 
down 20 cents from late monday

bond sales that cost customers of lincoln 
savings and loan association more than 250 million flagrantly 
violated securities rules the chairman of the house banking 
committee says 
the bonds issued by lincolns phoenix arizbased parent 
company american continental corp are considered worthless they 
were sold to 22000 buyers many of them elderly pensioners who 
invested their life savings 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas whose panel is investigating 
the collapse of lincoln headquartered in irvine calif said in a 
news release monday that bond salespeople were paid bonuses of up 
to 300 a month 
these bonuses appear to be a flagrant violation of securities 
and exchange commission regulations and they directly contradict 
a statement in the american continental prospectus gonzalez 
said 
an attorney representing american continental had not seen the 
committees latest accusations and had no immediate comment on them 
monday 
regulators who seized lincoln in april estimate the failure 
will cost taxpayers 2 billion making it the costliest sampl 
collapse in the nations history lincoln depositors were protected 
by federal insurance but customers who bought american continental 
subordinated debt from salespeople in lincoln branch lobbies were 
not 
meanwhile senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
added his voice to those calling for the resignation of m danny 
wall the top regulator of the sampl industry 
everyone will be better served by a clean break and new 
leadership mitchell said at a luncheon with reporters on monday 
he said he does not know wall or necessarily blame him for the 
industrys problems others have accused wall director of the 
office of thrift supervision of having evidence of irregularities 
at lincoln two years before it was shut down 
in a hearing before the banking committee earlier this month 
bondholders testified they either were led to believe or were 
explicitly told the debt was similar to a federally insured 
certificate of deposit 
gonzalez based his allegation that securities regulations were 
violated partly on a july 26 memo written by dariush razavi a 
senior vice president at lincoln to mark randall the government 
agent supervising the sampl 
razavi said bond salespeople received incentive payments up 
to 300 a month for achieving sales goals 
with the offer of hundreds of dollars per month in the 
prohibited bonuses dangling before their eyes its no wonder the 
employees were lured into steering lincoln customers away from 
their safe insured deposits to the highrisk bonds gonzalez said 
another senior lincoln official who committee aides declined to 
identify by name told the committee that memoranda announcing the 
bonuses were destroyed in an attempt to cover up the violations 
gonzalez said 
the arizona republic in todays editions quoted three former 
lincoln employees involved with the bond sales as saying the 
bonuses ranged up to 500 
we did a lot more than we were supposed to said bryan 
grossman identified by the republic as a 25yearold former 
lincoln financial representative in west los angeles 
the newspaper did not identify the other two former employees 
but reported they said the bondsales goals were part of an overall 
customer service program 
razavi said bond salespeople were on average 22 years old 
earned 20000 a year and were young impressionable and eager 
to further their careers 
although bond salespeople were paid by american continental 
they easily transferred back and forth between the payroll of the 
sampl and its holding company he said 
seventyseven percent of the current employees of lincoln 
savings were directly involved with the bond program razavi said 
he said salespeople sincerely believed they were promoting 
worthwhile investments and noted that they sold 107 million of 
the bonds to themselves or family members 
gonzalez also said that 13 million of the debt sales came late 
in 1986 before american continental had obtained the necessary 
permission from california regulators 
the banking committee held six hearings this fall exploring why 
regulators delayed closing lincoln the senate ethics committee has 
hired an independent counsel to examine charges that five senators 
alan cranston dcalif donald w riegle jr dmich dennis 
deconcini dariz john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz 
improperly intervened with regulators on lincolns behalf

braniff inc unable to meet a bankruptcy 
judges deadline to pay 3 million to an aviation company for five 
leased jets blamed it on a legal dispute that left little time to 
obtain financing 
braniff is exploring ways to get the midnight monday payment 
deadline extended said company spokeswoman ann cook 
lawyers and us officials for gpa group ltd an irish leasing 
company would not comment monday 
braniff is behind in other bills including 16 million owed to 
kansas city international airport cook said a meeting of 
braniffs creditors is scheduled for today in orlando 
orlandobased braniff filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code on sept 28 its second 
such filing in seven years the airline stopped flying nov 7 when 
it laid off most of its remaining employees 
braniff once an employer of more than 4800 now has about 275 
workers and is trying to continue as a charter carrier 
us bankruptcy judge c timothy corcoran said saturday that gpa 
could sue braniff to get the five aircraft back if the airline did 
not meet the deadline braniff took delivery of the planes before 
filing for bankruptcy 
corcorans decision came after a fiveday trial in a lawsuit 
brought by braniff against gpa braniff claimed breach of contract 
when gpa canceled a lease agreement for 50 airbus a320 jets a few 
hours before braniff filed for bankruptcy 
in large measure we have been prevented from obtaining the 
financing for mondays payment because of the litigation with 
gpa cook said once the dispute involving the contracts was 
cleared up we had only two days to come up with financing were 
working on this 
the airlines most valuable asset its lease and purchase 
agreements for the 50 jets could not be subleased or sold until 
corcorans ruling that the contracts for the airbuses are valid 
gpa and other defendants in the lawsuit are parties in several 
complex agreements designed to enable braniff to lease 26 airbuses 
from gpa buy 24 from avsa sarl and finance the transaction 
braniff also had an option to buy another 50 airbuses 
american airlines has discussed the possibility of acquiring the 
airbuses from braniff

the supreme court in a dispute stemming from 
the 1981 settlement of the iran hostage crisis ruled today that 
american companies recovering money from iran must pay a portion to 
the us government 
by a 90 vote the justices upheld a 1985 law requiring 
companies that win claims against iran before a special 
international tribunal to pay 15 percent of the first 5 million 
recovered and 1 percent of the excess to the us government 
justice byron r white writing for the court said the money 
paid to the federal treasury is a reasonable user fee intended 
to reimburse the government for its costs also he said united 
states participation in the international tribunal assures the 
companies they will collect money owed them by iran 
white rejected arguments by sperry corp that forcing companies 
to pay the fees is an unconstitutional confiscation of their 
property and that any costs to the government should be borne by 
the nation as a whole 
as we see it sperry has not identified any of its property 
that was taken without just compensation he said 
the bush administration said tens of millions of dollars were at 
stake including some 127 million already deducted by the us 
government from claims paid to companies 
the financial deal that freed the 52 american hostages from iran 
included the release by the us government of billions of dollars 
in frozen iranian assets also the settlement set up a process 
permitting those with claims against iran to take them to an 
international tribunal 
the supreme court in 1981 upheld the power of former president 
jimmy carter to approve the settlement and that was not at issue 
in todays ruling 
sperry corp which leased computer systems to iran before the 
1979 hostage crisis severed relations between the united states and 
that country was awarded 28 million by the tribunal set up to 
handle claims after the hostages were freed 
sperry was ordered to pay the us government 42000 for what 
the government said was us expenses in helping resolve the 
companys claim against iran 
a federal appeals court here ruled in 1988 that the fee is an 
unconstitutional seizure of private property by the government 
in overruling the appeals court white said this court has 
never held that the amount of a user fee must be precisely 
calibrated to the use that a party makes of government services 
nor does the government need to record invoices and billable hours 
to justify the costs of its services 
todays ruling is not related directly to recent developments 
suggesting easing of tensions between iran and the united states 
the bush administration announced three weeks ago that the 
united states is returning 567 million in frozen assets to iran a 
move prsident bush said he hopes will prompt tehran to push for 
freedom for american hostages in lebanon 
the 567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims by 
american banks against iran 
the case is us vs sperry corp 88952 
meanwhile in an unrelated case the court ruled by a 90 vote 
that a federal law aimed primarily at compensating injured 
dockworkers also applies to railroad employees who clean and repair 
dockside locading equipment 
it ruled that three injured railroad workers from virginia are 
limited to receiving benefits under the longshoremens and harbor 
workers compensation act they had sought potentially greater 
compensation under a disability law covering the railroad industry 
the federal employers liability act 
justice byron r white writing for the court said the workers 
were covered by the longshoremens act because their jobs were 
essential to the loading process

of the 2200 pilots who last week ended their sympathy walkout

available to work when the replacement workers take those jobs 
they inherit a right to those jobs eastern vice president tom

worked for the nrc which regulates commercial nuclear power and 
its predecessor the atomic energy commission for 24 years 
the latest manuevering by watkins stems from the political 
controversy surrounding the stello nomination several prominent 
members of congress including some members of the senate armed 
services committee that held confirmation hearings earlier this 
month claim stello is unfit for the position 
stellos critics contend he lacks enough commitment to nuclear 
safety and that his reputation for drawing controversy could 
undermine the credibility of the weapons program at a time when 
public trust in the programs safety is declining 
in the latest sign of trouble in the weapons complex the 
department on tuesday dispatched a highlevel team of experts to 
the rocky flats plutonium processing plant in colorado to try to 
resolve continuing safety concerns 
watkins said this is a critical time at rocky flats but did 
not elaborate beyond saying federal and state officials had raised 
unspecific safety issues at rocky flats which already is under fbi 
investigation for alleged environmental violations 
after confirmation hearings on stello nov 15 and 16 the senate 
armed servies committee decided to postpone action until after 
congress reconvenes in january the panel held open the possibility 
that stello would be asked to testify again 
tuck said the appointment was made after watkins consulted with 
sens sam nunn dga the armed services committee chairman and 
john warner of virginia the panels ranking republican

a group of florida farm workers marched 
outside a meeting of federal labor officials tuesday to protest a 
citrus companys plan to import hundreds of foreign pickers at 
rockbottom wages 
its nothing but legalized slave labor as far as were 
concerned said farm labor organizer fernando cuevas who led the 
protest theres no reason to bring in foreign workers when weve 
already got too many american workers 
at issue is the federal governments h2 program which allows 
foreign workers into the country to pick crops when domestic labor 
is in short supply 
the program was started under the immigration reform and control 
act in 1987 after farmer complaints that legalization of many alien 
workers in recent years had depleted their labor pool 
oakley brothers inc a lake walesbased grower has petitioned 
the government to bring in 942 workers from mexico in january to 
pick citrus at a prevailing rate of 65 cents a box 
sixtyfive cents is an absolute minimum rate that oakley wants 
to pay to everyone said farm worker tirso moreno its not 
that theres not enough american workers theres just not enough 
who will work for 65 cents a box 
moreno said other growers are paying seasonal rates ranging from 
103 to 123 a box 
cuevas claimed that growers such as oakley are seeking foreign 
workers who will agree to substandard wages and working conditions 
which he said undermines domestic workers and puts more americans 
on welfare 
about 75 chanting signcarrying demonstrators marched outside a 
hotel where more than 200 federal farm labor officials were holding 
a national planning conference 
some of the conferees who oversee the h2 program said every 
effort will be made to protect domestic workers 
for us to approve oakleys petition it has to be demonstrated 
that theyve exhausted their domestic supply of workers said 
carol gaudin atlanta regional administrator for the us 
department of labors employment standards administration 
gaudin said a decision will be made on oakleys petition up to 
12 days before the january picking date when workers are needed 
every effort is being made to hear the concerns of the 
domestic workers she said adding that federal representatives 
were to meet with the farm worker representatives 
the application by oakley is the first by a citrus or vegetable 
grower in florida under the federal program h2 workers from 
jamaica have been used the past few season for cutting sugar cane 
an oakley spokesman did not immediately return telephone calls

the stock market closed higher today as 
investors remained focused on the direction of the economy and 
interest rates 
the market opened weak following mondays rally then stalled 
around midday after the dow jones industrial average pierced the 
psychological resistance level of 2700 
the bluechip indicator had not closed higher since the day 
before the oct 13 stock plunge when it reached 275984 
the market regained its footing in midafternoon behind a 
strengthening bond market but wasnt able to sustain a strong 
rally as volume faded 
it was a sleepy slow day not the kind of market that gives 
people inspiration said john burnett senior vice president at 
the investment firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
analysts said recent actions by the federal reserve confused 
investors and sent many scurrying to the sidelines to await fresh 
signals as to its intentions 
the federal reserve on monday drained reserves from the banking 
system in a move that surprised many observers the fed action 
pushed up the federal funds rate the interest commercial banks 
charge each other for overnight loans 
last week the fed added funds to the system which many 
analysts took as a signal that the central bank was allowing 
shortterm interest rates to fall in an effort to cushion the 
impact of a slowing economy 
analysts said that despite the confusion investors remained 
generally optimistic that interest rates are in an overall 
declining pattern 
over the next couple months the perception is that rates have 
to come down so theres no reason to get excited about shortterm 
action by the fed said dennis jarrett technical analyst with 
kidder peabody amp co 
oil stocks led the bluechips on the upside while technology 
stocks remained generally weak equities traders said

the 104yearold miller amp rhoads department 
store chain once a pricey trendsetter for christmas shoppers sat 
tuesday like a rack of last seasons fashions as officials sought 
buyers for the failing operation 
the demise of miller amp rhoads which has 14 stores in virginia 
and north carolina followed a gloomy trend in the retail industry 
that has left giants like campeau corp struggling with debt after 
buying allied stores corp and federated department stores inc and 
lj hooker corp liquidating six of its seven b altman amp co 
branches 
ironically miller amp rhoads was once part of allied the 
investor group that owns miller amp rhoads bought it from campeau in 
1987 six months after campeau won a 34 billion takeover battle 
for allied and began selling stores to pare its debts 
miller amp rhoads president john e stokely said monday the 
company had filed a plan in us bankruptcy court contemplating the 
sale of all its assets rather than attempting to reorganize the 
business 
stokely confirmed reports that circulated for the past week that 
may department stores co the nations seventhlargest retailer 
was negotiating to purchase four miller amp rhoads stores for its 
hecht co chain based in washington dc 
a news conference scheduled tuesday by hecht officials at which 
the purchase was expected to be announced was canceled may 
spokesman james abrams said there were still details to be worked 
out but there has been no change in our intentions whatsoever 
may owns 14 department store chains including the upscale lord amp 
taylor the 22store hecht chain had 759 million in sales last 
year 
the fate of miller amp rhoads other stores remained in doubt 
tuesday although stokely said negotiations were under way with a 
potential buyer for two branches in roanoke and lynchburg he would 
not identify the buyer 
the planned sale of miller amp rhoads came as other big department 
store chains including federateds bloomingdales division were 
also on the block campeau said recently it would sell 
bloomingdales to raise badlyneeded cash 
two other big chains new yorkbased saks fifth avenue and 
chicagobased marshall field also are up for sale their owner 
britains bat industries plc is restructuring its businesses as it 
fights an unwanted takeover bid 
retail industry analysts said it may take some time for miller amp 
rhoads to sell its stores 
there are a lot of department store properties on the block 
now and people are being careful about what theyre paying said 
analyst william smith of smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york 
miller amp rhoads filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection 
last july listing debts of 873 million and assets of 1296 
million 
the company suffered from the same sluggish sales that afflicted 
many other retailers it began to have cash flow problems soon 
after the investor group led by philadelphia developer kevin f 
donohoe purchased the stores from campeau for 65 million 
miller amp rhoads has been a basket case for some time said 
pamela stubing an analyst with moodys investment service in new 
york the debt from the 1987 purchase probably was too much for 
them she said 
donohoe who controlled 83 percent of the company said sales 
for fiscal 1989 were 1425 million down 31 percent from 147 
million the previous year 
stokely said miller amp rhoads would operate through the christmas 
season including afterholiday returns and refunds our 
customers can be confident that we will continue to operate 
normally he said 
miller amp rhoads had planned to trim the chain to eight stores by 
next spring leaving four stores in the richmond area three in 
hampton roads and one in charlottesville 
but stokely said the companys current circumstances and 
financial condition led the board of directors to conclude that a 
reorganization as a profitable going concern is not feasible

allegheny international inc filed a revised 
joint stock plan of reorganization with us bankruptcy court on 
tuesday 
the consumer products company which manufactures sunbeam and 
oster small appliances has been reorganizing under chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy laws since february 1988 
the revised stock plan continues to be jointly proposed by 
allegheny international and its secured bank lenders

sunbeam claims except for certain obligations that are being 
reinstated it also provides for payment in cash of 2375 million 
to sunbeam institutional lenders in full settlement of all claims 
for postpetition interest and other charges 
allowed claims of allegheny internationals secured bank group 
would be paid in cash to the full extent of cash available but 
allegheny international management said it does not anticipate any 
cash will be available for such distribution 
as a result it is expected the secured bank claims class would 
instead receive about 59 percent of the reorganized companys new 
common stock it also is believed chemetron creditors and creditors 
of certain other allegheny international subsidiaries will receive 
about 11 percent of such common stock 
allegheny international said in a statement the official 
committee of unsecured creditors informed the company if will not 
support the stock plan 
the stock plan is expected to take effect around march 31 1990

petroleum futures prices tumbled tuesday despite 
an opec agreement to limit crude oil production 
energy market analysts said traders doubted that the 13 members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries would abide by 
their promises and keep oil output to 22 million barrels a day in 
the first half of next year 
the january contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil slid 38 cents to close at 1925 per 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for 
delivery in february through april posted similar declines 
the january crude contract ended with a 19cent loss on monday 
refined petroleum products traded on the new york merc also 
ended lower in part due to the developments at opecs regular 
winter conference heavy wholesale gasoline stocks in the northeast 
and technical selling also weighed down gas futures 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for december delivery dropped 136 
cents to settle at 4953 cents a gallon adding to mondays loss of 
074 cent contracts for later delivery also finished sharply lower 
no 2 heating oil for december delivery shed 061 cent to 6031 
cents a gallon after falling 049 cent in the previous session the 
january through march contracts finished with larger declines 
andrew lebow a senior broker at edampf man international 
futures inc said i think that the market lost ground today on 
skepticism regarding the recently concluded opec agreement 
opecs 13 ministers meeting in vienna austria signed a 
productionlimiting deal intended to raise the price of their crude 
oil to at least 18 a barrel and curb cheating on individual output 
quotas in the first half of 1990 
the ministers agreed to raise the cartels selfimposed daily 
production limit to 22 million barrels from the current 205 
million barrels opec also changed its target price of 18 a 
barrel to a minimum reference price 
a basket of opec crudes monitored by the cartel stands at 1774 
a barrel 
apart from the possibility that opec members kuwait in 
particular might overproduce lebow said there is speculation the 
cartel has been overly optimistic in its demand projections for 
next year this means that even if opec stays within its limits it 
would still have excess crude 
meanwhile he said gasoline futures prices have been depressed 
by industry statistics showing abundant supplies on the east coast 
weekly figures from the american petroleum institute due to be 
released after the market closed were expected to confirm another 
buildup in gas stocks

some farmers are still gouging the government 
by collecting crop subsidies in excess of limits set by congress 
the agriculture departments watchdog agency said tuesday 
in one case the departments office of inspector general said 
an individual collected about 28 million in subsidies 56 times 
the 50000 limit set by law 
the semiannual report to congress on investigative and audit 
activities cited other abuses including crop insurance 
overpayments loopholes in debt restructuring by the farmers home 
administration and flaws in the export subsidy program 
by law the crop subsidies called deficiency payments are 
not supposed to exceed 50000 per person per year these are 
direct payments to help make up the difference between depressed 
market prices and higher target prices set by the government 
for example last month the price of corn at the farm was 220 
a bushel the target price for 1989 corn is 284 
a person can be an individual a joint stock company a 
corporation an association a trust or some other legal entity 
the report said abuses in the program continued in spite of 
efforts by congress in the 1987 omnibus reconciliation act to close 
loopholes overall in 1987 an estimated 66 million was paid to 
farmers who dodged the 50000 limitation 
investigators have found that big operators often reorganize to 
qualify additional persons for the purpose of collecting larger 
payments 
in one case an individual used relatives employees and 
business associates as persons under the program the report 
said those totaled at least 21 in 1986 and 29 in 1987 payments 
totaled about 28 million for the two years plus more in 1988 and 
1989 which are under review by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
we have recommended that ascs improve its review procedures 
and withhold 1989 payments until final eligibility is determined 
the report said 
the chairman of the senate agriculture committee sen patrick 
leahy dvt said outrageous payments such as these undermine 
public support for farmers a few bad apples are giving all farmers 
a bad name 
a spokesman for the national farmers union michael v dunn 
said that loopholes in the law are something weve been concerned 
about for a long time 
we end up with subsidies going to all types of corporations 
and corporate investors he said we have long advocated 
targeting those payments to familysized operations 
other findings in the report which covered the six months ended 
sept 30 included 
loss adjustment errors by the federal crop insurance corp and 
reinsured private companies resulted in overpayments estimated at 
91 million out of 716 million paid out in claims underpayments 
totaled 16 million 
under farmers home administration debtrestructuring 
procedures borrowers were able to sell off security property and 
still qualify for buyout benefits buyouts allow borrowers to 
have debts written off by fmha after buying back the note at 30 
cents on the dollar based on the value of the remaining property 
held as collateral 
for example one borrower improperly disposed of a portion of 
collateral securing outstanding debt totaling 160000 the 
report said however since the borrower qualified for the 
buyout fmha allowed the borrower to buyout the debt for about 30 
cents on the dollar a loss to the government of 112000 
the report recommended fmha seek legislation that would deny a 
buyout to anyone who demonstrated a lack of good faith under 
the debtrestructuring program 
subsidized sales of farm commodities to designated foreign 
countries are provided under the export enhancement program or 
eep private exporting companies collect the subsidies or bonuses 
in the form of surplus commodities held by the departments 
commodity credit corp 
the subsidies enable the exporters to charge foreign customers 
lower prices than otherwise would be the case and that enables 
us products to compete in overseas markets with other suppliers 
notably the european economic community which has export subsidy 
programs of its own 
but investigators said they found that some countries in the 
program do not show strong competition with us commodities 
overall the report questioned eep bonus payments of 151 million 
for transportation costs which may not be allowed by federal 
law and payments of 898 million that resulted from a possible 
miscalculation of world prices

polaroid corp announced tuesday it was developing 
equipment for hospitals to take electronic pictures as the company 
tries to compete more in the medical business while continuing to 
look beyond instant photography 
this is a complete and total departure in some ways said 
len aberbach polaroids director of medical imaging 
polaroid based in cambridge said its electronic imaging 
technology for hospitals is in the developmental stage and will be 
available for sale in 1991 the company gave a preview of its plans 
this week in chicago at the annual meeting of the radiological 
society of north america 
the new imaging system is designed to record images from 
electronic diagnostic tools in hospitals giving doctors pictures 
of internal organs and other body parts 
like traditional polaroid systems the new system will record 
images that are instantly available and require no processing 
equipment or darkroom facilities but unlike other polaroid 
materials the technology will not rely on lightsensitive film 
also the company said the system will provide pictures as 
sharp and as detailed as those processed in conventional 
photography and doctors will be able to enhance the images 
the new system is the forerunner of an era of electronic 
imaging for polaroid an era of new imaging devices and new media 
that we with our instant photography heritage are particularly 
well suited for i macallister booth president and chief 
executive officer of the company said in a prepared statement 
polaroid built its success around instant photography but 
recently the company has been moving into other ventures including 
conventional film 
the strategy comes as the company tries to rebuild profits after 
the last fiscal year when polaroid lost 226 million while 
fending off a hostile takeover bid 
part of the companys new approach is to promote the use of 
instant photography for businesses such as real estate insurance 
auto body repair and architects 
polaroid for years has marketed its products to medical 
professionals aberbach said in an interview from chicago 
ophthalmologists have used standard polaroid film to take instant 
pictures of patients retinas while plastic surgeons have used it 
for photos of peoples faces 
but aberbach said polaroid was unable to maintain a strong 
position in the medical market because the company did not offer 
the technology to meet hospitals specific needs 
polaroids medicalrelated sales exceed 100 million aberbach 
said but the overall market for medical diagnostic imaging has 
about 13 billion in sales annually 
but while the company is targeting the medical field for its new 
technology polaroid officials said other groups such as graphics 
designers might be able to use applications of the system in the 
future

the commodity futures trading commission approved the dual 
trading curb project as an objective for fiscal year 1990

earlier this month that said dual trading does not enhance market

dual trading in which floor traders can conduct transactions 
for themselves as well as their customers is legal but has come 
under sharp criticism since more than 40 traders were indicted last 
august on various fraud charges 
critics charge that dual trading was linked to many of the 
alleged schemes uncovered at the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
the cftcs division of trading and markets is working on 
proposed rulemaking that would restrict dual trading on a 
staggered phasedin pilot basis by floor members in certain 
markets subject to certain exceptions 
the cftc did not specify what exchanges or what exceptions would 
be included in the proposed rules 
in the first quarter of fiscal year 1990 the division will 
prepare proposed rules for consideration by the fivemember cftc 
following a 60day comment period the division will begin 
drafting final rules in the second quarter with final approval of 
the dual trading curbs coming in the third quarter

colt industries inc said tuesday it 
would sell its beleaguered firearms division to a group of 
investors in a deal that could end a nearly 4yearold strike by 
some union workers 
terms of the sale to cf holding corp which includes a colt 
executive and two former united technologies corp officials were 
not disclosed analysts had said they expected the sale to bring 
between 150 million and 200 million 
the deal at the 153yearold company that makes the colt 45 
pistol ended 3 months of negotiations as well as attempts by 
striking union workers to buy the division 
michael dunn a spokesman for new yorkbased colt industries 
said company officials expected to complete the sale in january 
the new company will be called colts manufacturing co 
the new owners said they did not know how many people will be 
employed by the company but they extended an offer of sorts to 
striking united auto workers who walked off the job in january 1986 
anthony d autorino one of the investors said the new company 
would contact current and striking colt workers immediately and 
begin hiring based on skill and seniority within three weeks 
we think this will work out well for the people of connecticut 
and the workers as well autorino said in a statement 
colt currently employs about 950 workers at plants in hartford 
and west hartford another 800 union workers are still on strike 
colt was founded in hartford in 1836 by samuel colt who 
invented the revolver the firearms division is a leading 
manufacturer of handguns and rifles for military and commercial 
uses 
products include the colt 45 pistol the king cobra magnum 
revolver ar15 sport rifle and the m16 military rifle the 
company also makes aerospace and automotive parts 
colt lost its contract to produce the m16 for the army in 1988 
the loss of that contract coupled with the strike apparently 
figured in colts decision to sell that division but company 
officials deny it played a role 
the buyout of colt firearms division by the cf holding corp 
offers us an opportunity to write a new chapter for colt workers 
and i am hopeful that all the elements of this will come 
together phillip wheeler executive director of the uaws region 
9a said in a statement 
the investors include autorino former president of united 
technologies hamilton standard division and now president of 
wethersfieldbased shared technologies richard f gamble another 
former president of hamilton standard and ronald f stilwell colt 
firearms vice president for military sales 
autorino declined to identify the remaining investors 
when colt announced in april it was seeking a buyer the union 
and managers of the firearms division combined forces with the 
state and private investors to make a bid state officials declined 
to comment on tuesdays announcement 
about 1050 union workers walked off the job jan 24 1986 
after failing to reach agreement on a new contract during 10 months 
of negotiations some workers have crossed picket lines and others 
have found new jobs leaving about 800 on strike replacement 
workers have been hired to fill their positions 
autorino said the colt plants are to close briefly in january to 
allow for inventory and transition he said the plants should be 
operating at full capacity by march 1990 
we have fairly extensive marketing and strategy plans which we 
think can bring colt back into its rightful place at the top of the 
industry autorino said 
in september a judge found that colt changed working conditions 
unilaterally and refused to bargin in good faith with the striking 
workers the judge ordered colt to rehire the strikers and pay lost 
wages estimated as high as 40 million 
autorino declined to discuss how the award figured into the 
sale wheeler did not immediately return phone calls seeking 
comment
