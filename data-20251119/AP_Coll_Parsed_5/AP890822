israels religious affairs minister 
zevulun hammer met with cardinal franciszek macharski on tuesday in 
an effort to resolve the dispute over a roman catholic convent at 
the former death camp at auschwitz 
hammer was the first highranking israeli official to visit 
poland since diplomatic relations were severed more than 20 years 
ago 
any conclusions reached by hammer and the krakow cardinal during 
their 1 hour meeting of krakow were not released 
members of hammers family died at auschwitz and he visited the 
site before meeting the cardinal said a spokesman for the israeli 
interest section in warsaw 
macharski announced this month that the convent would not be 
moved from the camps perimeter as promised in an international 
accord signed by jewish and catholic leaders in geneva 
catholic leaders initially agreed to transfer the carmelite nuns 
by feb 22 to an interfaith prayer center to be built farther from 
the camp but macharski said the agreement would not be honored in 
an atmosphere of aggressive demands 
protests by jewish groups increased after the deadline passed in 
one highly publicized incident on july 14 an american rabbi and six 
students demonstrating at the convent were roughly evicted by 
workmen at the site 
jewish groups and others have viewed the convent as an offensive 
intrusion of christian symbols at the camp where an estimated 25 
million jews died 
poland with the rest of the soviet bloc except romania cut 
diplomatic ties with israel in 1967 after the arabisraeli war but 
contact has been steadily increasing israel now has an independent 
interest section in warsaw 
hammer will also meet polish political leaders during his 
fiveday visit that began sunday

a quartercentury ago betty friedan called the 
oppression of american women the problem that has no name but 
japan today has a name for meiri marimos problem shes leftover 
christmas cake 
miss marimo in other words has grown a bit stale as a 
marriageable commodity at least thats what her mother complains 
in japan where many marriages are still arranged a woman is 
considered to have a shelf life of about 25 years 
when miss marimo was 28 she left for new york alone 
sumiko morikawa sits next to the no smoking sign in her 
waldorfastoria office and lights a cigarette at 39 she says shes 
looking for a new man she isnt particular about his background 
as long as he isnt japanese 
japanese men and women they cannot understand how to love 
says miss morikawa the owner of a translating service three years 
ago she ended a 16year marriage undertaken to please her 
traditionminded brother in japan no passion she says 
japanese businessmen are very nice but they are so totally 
qualitycontrolled they see themselves as company men and their 
wives also they say im a mitsubishi wife it kills the 
individuality of people 
it is 1130 am renko isowa 42 pauses over a dish of vanilla 
ice cream as she cheerily recalls the strict training of her youth 
in the traditional female skills 
i learned flower arrangement tea ceremony and cooking for two 
years i was totally dead says miss isowa vice president of a 
television production company here 
i wanted to start working i wanted to be a member of real 
society 
twentysix years after the feminine mystique friedans 
manifesto of womens rights helped kindle feminism in the west 
only a trickle of women in japan are able or willing to live out its 
creed but many of those few come to the united states to try 
the three expatriates above may seem refreshingly liberated but 
in japan many would consider them wildeyed radicals they insist on 
standing out in a society where wa or group harmony dictates the 
nail that stands out is hammered down 
japanese women havent been raised to have aspirations says 
jane condon author of a halfstep behind japanese women of the 
80s theyre still facing boundaries we broke through 20 years 
ago 
to be good american you have to be an individual to be a good 
japanese youd better damn sight not be says steven fochios a 
new york city psychiatrist who counsels many japanese women 
the women who come to the us then get into the machinery 
of the country are able to enjoy the kinds of freedoms they had 
never dreamed of he says and these women are tough they are 
tough 
miss marimos family frets to no avail to her friends she is 
an incredible oyahuko a bad daughter a few years ago she 
moved into her own apartment in tokyo watching defiantly as the 
social pressures that mold a japanese womans life a cycle of 
temporary employment marriage and childraising claimed her 
schoolmates one by one 
her old friends spoke to me as if they were accusing me 
criticizing me very severely recalls the lithe longhaired miss 
marimo a freelance writer 
i didnt care at all i dont want to be involved in 
housekeeping i smiled a japanese smile and left 
in the united states disaffected minorities organize as 
american women did in the 1970s in japan it has always been easier 
to jump ship than to rock the boat until recently 
today the glacial rigidity of japanese society otoko no 
shakai the mans world shows signs of thawing after more than a 
century of uneasy integration with the west japans giant 
corporations facing chronic worker shortages as the economy surges 
are beginning to open management jobs to women traditionally they 
are hired as teapouring office ladies while pursuing their real 
vocation marriage 
japanese women are even making an impact on politics a record 22 
women won seats in the july 23 elections for parliaments upper 
house female voters had been angered by allegations that japans 
justdeparted prime minister sousuke uno kept paid mistresses 
the election also showed however that much has not changed 
many of the victorious female parliamentary candidates had portrayed 
themselves not as feminists but as simple housewives immune from 
corruption 
indeed apart from the odd individualist who ventures abroad to 
live few japanese women want change 
if you go to a party here and introduce yourself as a 
housewife people will think youre strange but in japan its ok 
being a housewife doesnt bother japanese women because they have a 
social position says kako nakagawa the executive editor of new 
york yomiuri a newspaper published for japanese in north america 
i think in the united states you have no secure place for 
women she says here there are opportunities for women so if 
you dont try anthing hard then you feel guilty but in japan 
there are no opportunities so theres no such struggle its easy 
when i go to japan the japanese women i see are very 
contentlooking very happy says naoko adams a researcher for 
sunstar corp a japanese company with offices in new york when i 
come back to america i notice the women look very unhappy 
frustrated 
while women in japan are largely blocked from positions of power 
they provide a vital temporary worker base that absorbs economic 
downturns allowing large japanese companies to maintain their 
muchvaunted lifetime employment system for permanent workers 
in addition they are the linchpin of an economic system that allows 
men to spend long hours working and as is expected socializing 
afterward 
with the men otherwise occupied women often control family purse 
strings and so completely control their childrens destinies that 
surveys have shown the central relationship in a japanese mans life 
is not between him and his wife but between him and his mother 
so strong is such patterning of japanese women in fact that 
leaving it behind sometimes causes deep emotional problems for 
expatriates who must spurn what they have been taught since 
childhood and embrace alien values 
some of them say they feel guilty about being free as an 
american says fochios the psychiatrist they feel inferior to 
a japanese woman because they dont have the capacity to be a good 
japanese wife 
some expatriate women however simply decide to ignore american 
values 
japanese women are better off i dont think i would like to 
marry an american man says kiyomi koizumi a 65yearold 
neurophysiologist who came to the united states in 1949 and married 
a japanese 
i always say my husband is like air you would miss it if its 
not there i cant live without it but you dont feel it an 
american man might be around me too much

the political opposition is pursuing an 
unprecedented dialogue with the armed forces seeking a formula for 
peaceful coexistence when chile returns to civilian government in 
march 
the military which has ruled since 1973 has indicated a 
willingness to negotiate but only under certain conditions 
both sides agree that the lack of communication in the past had 
led to a mutual animosity and distrust that both sides agree must be 
eliminated if the future government is to enjoy stability 
patricio aylwin the presidential candidate of a united 
centerleft opposition and heavily favored to win the presidential 
election dec 14 recently remarked we want an approach an 
exchange of views 
the isolation that has existed for years among civilians and 
military is not good for the country and must end aylwin added 
the time has come for a dialogue 
gen augusto pinochet the rightwing army commander who has been 
president since seizing power in september 1973 was obliged to 
call decembers general elections after losing a referendum in 
october on extending his rule to 1997 
aylwin and other opposition leaders want the dialogue to take 
place before the new government takes office march 11 
experts expect several highly conflictive items will be on the 
agenda 
ignacio walker a leading adviser to aylwin on military matters 
said the talks would include the role of the armed forces under the 
civilian government the continuation of the present 
commandersinchief in their posts the defense budget and probably 
the most sensitive problem how the new government will deal with 
the human rights violations during pinochets rule 
after the 1973 coup which toppled the elected government of 
marxist salvadoe allende the military launched a campaign of 
political repression thousands of leftists were arrested many were 
tortured killed or sent into exile human rights groups have 
documented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared after 
being arrested by seurity agents 
the opposition has said that it will investigate all pending 
cases of rights abuse and try those responsible 
its leaders have also said they will seek to repeal an amnesty 
law issued by pinochet that pardoned violations occurred from 1973 
to 1978 
that announcement by the opposition prompted a stern warning from 
the military ranks gen fernando matthei the air force commander 
who is considered politically moderate and has expressed support for 
a dialogue said repealing the amnesty law could unleash an 
unpredictible reaction by the armed forces 
those wanting to repeal the law do not realize how serious that 
could be matthei added 
he noted that pinochet himself has warned that an attempt to try 
military officials could lead to an interruption of the democratic 
transition 
opposition leaders have insisted they seek truth and justice 
not vengeance against the military they are under heavy political 
pressure from human rights groups representing victims of repression 
or their relatives 
another highly controversial subject is the constitutional clause 
that allows the military chiefs including pinochet to retain their 
military commands under the civilian government pinochet has said 
he will remain the armys leader for as long as the constitution 
allows until 1998 
even some progovernment politicians contend the new leadership 
must be empowered to make changes in the military command but the 
armed forces have vowed to make no concessions on the point a 
statement issued by the army warned the armed forces are prepared to 
use legitimate force to uphold constitution which was drafted 
by the military and approved in a referendum 
and military commanders insist that their mission includes 
ensuring internal stability as well as defending the country against 
foreign attack that is considered another potential area of 
controversy but opposition leaders say they are prepared to talk 
about it too in spite of the risks and difficulties 
the peaceful end of military dictatorships has never been easy 
and chile cannot be an exception wrote rene abeliuk a social 
democratic leader in a newspaper column 
the roman catholic church also has urged civilians and military 
to talk about their differences to help the transition to 
democracy

an old guidebook says one thing a foreigner in 
beirut need never worry about is making friends that was long 
ago before a civil war devastated the city and nation before the 
hostagetaking here is a report on what it was like by an ap 
correspondent who lived in beirut in those days 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i remember when beirut was the playground 
of the middle east a vibrant crossroad between the orient and the 
west the bright mediterranean sun glinted from its highrise 
buildings and its vaults were full of oil money 
beirut was a stimulating intellectual center then and a vital 
contact point for businessmen 
now it is a shambles strewn with garbage a city brought low by 
14 years of vicious civil war 
those of us who lived there remember beirut before the war as a 
place where 100000 foreigners mingled with middle eastern princes 
highrollers emigres adventurers and 17 christian and moslem sects 
a veneer of western culture was superimposed on the fragile 
sectarian structure created by the french when they granted lebanon 
independence in 1943 a dormant volcano of hatreds seethed beneath 
the exuberance and sophistication 
luxury hotels apartments and office blocks gleamed between the 
blue mediterranean and pinecovered mountains 
nonlebanese arabs constrained at home by puritanical moslem 
rules or dictators could kick up their heels with liquor women or 
300 roulette chips and voice their political opinions freely in the 
arab worlds only working democracy 
westerners came to tap the oil money that poured into beirut 
buying into several dozen lebanese banks or opening their own 
offices 
citibank of new york decorated a full floor of its office annex 
at the holiday inn with imported carpets and furniture 
a few months later we watched from the associated press office 
nearby as it was looted and destroyed by rival militias battling for 
strategic highrise buildings along what became the line dividing 
christian and moslem sectors of the city 
westerners found beirut intriguing for its combination of modern 
amenities with the oriental flavor of the old gold market its 
cosmopolitan society the middle eastern food at such restaurants 
such as ajamis 
i still have a dusty englishlanguage guidebook the last 
published before the war everywhere you will feel the warm 
eastern hospitality it says one thing a foreigner in beirut 
need never worry about is making friends 
fourteen years later scores of foreigners have been kidnapped 
most of them by virulently antiwestern moslem groups sixteen still 
are held including terry anderson an ap colleague 
more than 150000 lebanese most of them civilians have been 
killed in the war and 1 million have been displaced 
burnedout hulks of the st georges palm beach phoenicia and 
holiday inn hotels cluster in what once was beiruts tourist center 
and now is a wasteland inhabited only by snipers 
i recall sitting in the st georges restaurant in the good old 
days watching water skiers skim behind needlenosed italian 
speedboats 
there also was the lesscostly though fastidious myrtoum house 
restaurant and pension run by hans matschek an austrian expatriate 
regulars said it was the only place in lebanons sunny climate to 
risk eating steak tartare 
an attraction at night was the great casino de liban north of 
the city in what is now christian territory where one could gamble 
or watch two imported floor shows 
those with the right connections might attend functions dominated 
by the doyenne of high society isabelle soursock she was from an 
oldmoney lebanese christian family and became lady isabelle when 
she married sir desmond hamilton 
a vivid memory is of a visit to the home of henri pharaon a 
bachelor shipping millionaire who lived among priceless islamic art 
treasures and pictures of horses he raced against those of saudi 
princes 
the racetrack on the citys dividing line is a ruin now a 
nightmare scene of bulletsplintered trees and shell holes 
an unusual establishment even for beirut was the surprise it 
was the size of a packing crate and had a bartender four stools 
one hefty prostitute and a remarkable number of customers bidding 
for her favors 
the american university of beirut and large numbers of arab 
intellectuals who fled persecution in their own countries gave the 
city a more serious side 
the arab emigres contributed to the city more than the lebanese 
socialites said charles snow an oil economist who spent many 
years in beirut and moved to cyprus in 1976 
the american university and medical school once had 5000 
students and produced a great share of the professional academic 
and political leaders in the arab world 
among the graduates was dr george habash whose popular front 
for the liberation of palestine carried out airline hijackings in 
the 1970s 
a 5monthold artillery war between syrian and christian soldiers 
has forced the university to close temporarily several of its 
officials have been kidnapped 
adjoining the parklike university campus was the american 
community school where children of expatriate families studied and 
played little league baseball some tried the pinball machines at 
anwars where many british and american boys including my two 
sons learned arabic insults from local youngsters 
beirutis could ski at faraya on mount lebanon play tennis or 
squash and race in motor rallies 
an american journalist who played at the golf club of lebanon 
next to the nowclosed airport as late as 1983 wrote that the 
safest places on the course were the sand traps 
the luxurious delamiyeh country club with a gorgeous sea view 
from a ridge south of the city was abandoned after palestinian 
guerrillas took it over early in the war 
will the old beirut ever return 
no one knows but i remember khaled saab owner of summerland a 
functioning hotel built during the war a television reporter asked 
why he made the investment and saab replied 
did you as a child ever kick over an anthill did you see how 
quickly the ants rebuilt thats lebanon

for centuries the thames has been a working river 
a winding highway where barges tall ships then steamers brought 
the wealth of the world to one of its major commercial centers 
now its also a popular excurison river and sundays fatal 
collision of the pleasure cruise boat marchioness and a dredger many 
times its size raises questions about whether there is room for both 
transport minister michael portillo said monday the government 
will obviously be looking very carefully at whether to ban 
pleasure cruisers from the river 
the opposition labor party called for an immediate conference 
involving the port of london authority the police and river users 
to discuss what can be done to improve safety 
the port of london authority says the thames is like an 
eightlane motorway traveled by 37000 vessels annually but 
insists it is still one of the safest rivers in the world 
there are very few incidents indeed on the river thames a 
spokesman said its one of the safest in the world 
the port says 25 companies are licensed to operate 40 river 
cruise boats like the marchioness on the london stretch of the 
thames between greenwich and hampton court palace 
they have certainly increased the popularity has increased 
said port spokesman terry hatton although river cruise operators 
disagreed 
a ferry service was also launched last year taking passengers 
from central londons business and financial districts to the 
booming docklands residential and commercial development 
an ocean liner dropped anchor in the thames for the first time in 
a decade last year the first of 25 booked up to 1991 
the river cruisers carry about 2 million passengers annually by 
day theyre full of tourists viewing london from a different angle 
sailing past the houses of parliament the tower of london or the 
kew botanical gardens 
by night they become floating restaurants cocktail lounges or 
discos chartered for private parties 
in recent years the growth of tourist boats on sightseeing 
trips has been accentuated by the popularity of business 
entertaining by firms hiring crafts to take customers up and down 
the river said conservative lawmaker robert mccrindle 
add in the evening party types and the commercial traffic still 
using the river and the feeling that the river may be catering for 
too many small ships leads me to call for reassurances about 
safety 
david jeffery chief executive of the port of london said 
sundays accident involving the 90ton marchioness and the 1475ton 
dredger bowbelle was clearly a navigational matter and that the 
rules governing the passage of boats on the river may have to be 
reviewed 
jeffery said taped vhf radio messages from the bowbelle to the 
thames navigation center were being examined commercial vessels 
must report their positions and progress along the river 
particularly near bridges but pleasure craft do not 
if we required every small craft to report its every movement 
the airwaves would be so cluttered it would be difficult to get out 
of that a picture of the really important pieces where things could 
possibly go wrong jeffery said 
commercial ships have plied the thames for 2000 years berthing 
originally at natural indentations in the river vessels later 
docked in the center of the river and loaded their cargoes onto 
barges to be taken ashore 
river traffic surged in the 1890s when locks were built to 
control the strong tidal flow and trade peaked in 1964 when 64 
million tons were handled 
when container shipping was introduced in the mid1960s cargo 
ships moved to deeper ports like tilbury at the rivers mouth 
londons docks werent big enough to handl the new larger container 
ships 
pilots on the river have to undergo a five or sevenyear 
apprenticeship to become freemen of the watermen and lightermens 
company of the city of london which dates from 1514 members are 
also designated queens watermen responsible for rowing queen 
elizabeth ii on the rare occasions she travels the thames

twentyone years after it sent tanks to crush the 
prague spring reforms in czechoslovakia the soviet union is 
watching quietly as poland takes its political changes even further 
breaking the communist monopoly on power 
the soviet reaction to events in poland including the nomination 
of solidarity journalist tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister 
indicated how mikhail s gorbachev has shaken up the kremlins 
relations with its eastern european allies since sovietled warsaw 
pact forces halted czechoslovakias reforms on aug 21 1968 
in contrast with leonid i brezhnev gorbachev is willing to 
allow his allies to find their own way as he experiments with reform 
at home and grapples with nationalist movements on his own side of 
the border 
even in hungary and poland where reforms have proceeded the 
furthest they apparently have not gone beyond what is now 
acceptable to the kremlin it is no longer certain where that limit 
is 
the formation of a government in poland is an internal affair 
of the polish people soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri a 
gremitskykh told a news briefing monday 
at the same time we are not indifferent to it poland is a 
neighbor and an ally he said we hope the political forces in 
the country will act constructively to find a way out of the 
crisis 
gremitskykh was reiterating the cautious soviet reaction to 
events in the past several months as soldiarity has been legalized 
and carried out a successful election campaign 
in the meantime polands communist party has not been able to 
form a government and president wojciech jaruzelski was forced to 
turn to solidarity for a prime minister 
soviet officials last week expressed satisfaction at solidarity 
leader lech walesas statement that even a solidarityled government 
had responsibilities to the warsaw pact 
in 1981 jaruzelski crushed solidarity after it grew into a 
national movement ending speculation that brezhnev would again use 
soviet soldiers to bring a wayward ally back in line 
official soviet tv and radio are reporting the events in poland 
but generally refraining from making judgments about the political 
situation 
the communist party newspaper pravda on monday painted a grim 
picture of shortages of meat and other goods it said poland was on 
the brink of hyperinflation 
prospects of a coalition of solidarity and two minor 
noncommunist parties were becoming all the more realistic 
pravda said in contrast it said the polish communist party was 
living through one of the most difficult periods of its history 
gorbachev has said several times in trips to eastern europe that 
the soviet union believes its allies should be free to find their 
own road to developing socialism depending on local conditions 
twentyone years ago on aug 21 1968 brezhnev and the warsaw 
pact sent soldiers to czechoslovakia to end a reform spearheaded not 
by an organized opposition but by alexander dubcek and the 
czechoslovak communist party 
gorbachev is reported to be frustrated with the conservative 
leadership in prague that has been in power since 1968 and continues 
to block reform 
but the soviet reaction to the anniversary of the invasion 
indicates a continuing sensitivity 
the soviet union has never said that it made a mistake in sending 
soldiers into czechoslovakia 
in response to a question monday about how the soviet union now 
views the invasion gremitskykh said only that it had to be 
understood in the context of the times 
izvestia the soviet government newspaper on saturday printed 
remembrances of soldiers and soviet officials who took part in the 
invasion 
kiril t mazurov then a member of brezhnevs politburo said 
soviet leaders had learned of plans to provoke a nuclear attack on 
the soviet union 
the central committee of the communist party of czechoslovakia 
had lost control of the media in the difficult international 
environment we had just one wish to unite even more to prevent a 
war to survive together he said 
it was hard to imagine that a bourgeois parliamentary republic 
swarming with west germans and afterward americans might appear 
next to our borders he said 
vv nefyodov a 19yearold paratrooper when he was sent to 
prague in 1968 told izvestia he could not understand why he was 
sent to a country where the people didnt want him 
i was ashamed he said forgive us prague

north korea and china have pursued different 
paths in recent years but they still have a lot in common here is 
a report by one of several beijingbased reporters recently invited 
to pyongyang as the government there shows signs of seeking to end 
its long isolation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
how does a north korean buy a fancy 
watch leather shoes and japanese cigarettes in a country where such 
things theoretically require foreign currency 
i have a lot of friends said a north korean with all three 
as in china one cultivates friends not just for company but to 
skirt regulations and get access to scarce goods 
friendless north koreans are worse than lonely they are 
condemned to walk in flimsy plastic or cloth shoes and wait on long 
lines for the few public buses or trolleys that ply the broad 
avenues of this sprawling capital city there are no private 
vehicles and no bicycles are allowed in downtown 
i have friends who are official drivers said the wellshod 
north korean if i want to take my family somewhere i ask them 
and they say sure that could mean a trip in a mercedesbenz or 
at worst in a toyota nissan or volvo the only cars in north korean 
official fleets 
there is much in north korea to remind of life in china its 
socialist big brother across the yalu river slow service careful 
checks of travelers identification and lots of uniformed soldiers 
around although most are simply walking or standing along the road 
as in china interviews with officials often begin with a brief 
introduction that turns into an hourlong recitation of statistics 
and the official line officials give interviews in pairs one who 
is introduced and who answers questions and one who is never 
introduced but silently supervises 
chinas separate currencies for locals and foreigners confuse and 
annoy many visitors but north korea has three currencies 
ordinary pinkandgreen won can buy the bare necessities the 
cabbages eggplant and hardlooking apples and pears on display at a 
pyongyang greengrocers one recent morning 
foreigners who convert soviet rubles get red bills and have a few 
more choices but only holders of blue money changed from us 
dollars can buy cocacola kirin beer japanese televisions and 
british cigarettes 
friends who are diplomats and traders give blue money to 
me said the wellconnected north korean puffing on a japanese 
mild seven cigarette 
north korea doesnt have chinas hordes of youths openly trading 
the various currencies for illegal profit on the sidewalks or the 
dozens of other symptoms in china of crumbling official control 
chinese officials trying to reinstall past ideological unity 
after spring prodemocracy protests might well look to north korea 
for reminders on how it is done 
political slogans have faded from most walls in china in the past 
decade as senior leader deng xiaoping stressed economic development 
over ideology but signs every few hundred meters in rural north 
korea still exhort long live the great leader kim il sung long 
live the glorious workers party of korea 
north korea never let its political education mechanisms rust as 
china did professor kim wonsok at the national economic institute 
said that in workplaces political work is as important as 
production work 
perhaps most important citizens in north korea have not been 
allowed the sense of independence that comes from being ones own 
boss private businessmen were key supporters of chinas protests 
but private farm plots in north korea are kept tiny and there is 
virtually no other private economic activity 
how far china has strayed from such basics of oldtime socialist 
rule was illustrated by the comments of two ethnic korean women who 
live just inside the chinese border they spoke of visits to north 
korea much as overseas chinese used to talk of visiting china you 
and i can sit here and say what we like about deng xiaoping said 
one but they cant do that about kim il sung 
north korea is helped in its task of control by a smaller 
population 20 million people to chinas 12 billion and strong 
nonideological unifying forces a sense of outside threat from 
south korea and the common goal of national reunification ordinary 
koreans and officials spoke of these much more often than of juche 
the official philosophy of marxism and selfreliance 
in the 1950s and 1960s postwar reconstruction and the fear of 
us or soviet attack helped unify china but the 1970s and 1980s 
have seen increasing concern with individual goals 
but the north koreans have not given up all personal happiness 
for the glory of the nation even in a brief visit it was clear they 
still remember how to have a good time 
accordion music could be heard coming from several homes a youth 
with a guitar serenaded friends on the sidewalk one night in kaesong 
city near the border with the south 
and on a sunny afternoon several dozen young men in dirty blue 
work clothes went carousing at the nearby pagyon waterfalls 
redfaced and a bit wobbly they sang and danced down the road home

the us customs service arrested a west german 
and an afghan here monday for allegedly conspiring to export a 
sophisticated military computer to the soviet union 
the arrests of german national egbert partesuis 46 and abdul 
aziz ahmad 40 capped an eightmonth investigation into what thomas 
mcdermott special agent in charge said was a significant case 
the technology is such that its being sought by the soviet 
bloc and there are people attempting to obtain it in this country 
for them mcdermott said 
partesius was in the united states on a visitors visa ahmed was 
a resident alien living in alexandria va 
customs spokesman charles conroy said agents believe that 
partesuis ahmed and hady azimi who remained in west germany 
conspired to purchase and export a digital equipment vax 8820 
mainframe computer which requires a validated export license from 
the us department of commerce 
the vax 8820 has military capabilities and is not eligible for 
licensed export to soviet bloc countries conroy said 
mcdermott said the men intially paid 28000 to agents working 
undercover for an ibm computer with military applications and 
shipped it to west germany 
at that purchase they came forward with the deposit to purchase 
the vax 882 and gave a initial deposit then last thursday they came 
forward with the balance of the 596000 mcdermott said 
parthesuis and ahmed were charged in us district court with 
violating a 4yearold federal arms export control law and with 
conspiracy and money laundering if convicted on all counts each 
defendant could receive up to 35 years in prison and a 25 million 
fine 
the two are being held as federal prisoners at the maricopa 
county jail without bond mcdermott said

the navy investigation of the uss iowa 
explosion which killed 47 sailors has found various things wrong 
with procedures aboard the battleship but none of them can be 
determined to be the specific cause of the blast a defense official 
monday 
it does not point to the cause of the problem the official 
said the report cites a probability 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity was asked 
about reports that crew members of the no 2 gun turret that blew up 
april 19 were not properly certified for their jobs or failed to 
follow maintenance procedures designed to prevent breakdown in the 
turret 
the washington post reported in its tuesday editions that the 
naval investigation has found the crew faled to perform certain 
unspecified preventive maintenance procedures but the newspaper 
added it was not known whether the faulty maintenance caused the 
explosion 
the post reported the no 2 turrets guns passed prefiring 
checks before the explosion 
in a separate story the daily press of newport news va 
reported the navy failed to properly qualify the sailors who worked 
with the explosives in the turret the report said the navy requires 
that all who work at such posts be certified by a qualified board in 
order to handle the weapons 
michael drowns one of 11 sailors who escaped turret no 2 after 
the april 19 explosion told the daily press a qualification board 
was never convened on the iowa during his three years on the ship 
gunners mate 2nd class john mullahy and a third iowa survivor 
gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt said one of the sailors who 
lacked a qualification book showing facts about the guns was 
gunners mate 3rd class robert w backherms the rammerman of the 
center gun where the explosion occurred truitt said backherms 
joined the ship shortly after christmas was inexperienced and may 
have caused the blasts by ramming the bags of explosives into the 
gun too fast 
navy and pentagon officials would not confirm the details in the 
two newspaper reports 
they said the results of the investigation are still in the chain 
of command and the review process is not completed until then we 
are not in a position to comment said defense department 
spokesman fred hoffman 
navy spokesman cmdr mark baker said the investigaive process is 
not finished while the report remains in the chain of command and 
the chief of naval operations adm carlisle trost has not made it 
public 
as far as were concerned its all still under 
investigation baker said 
the defense department is expected to make the report public in 
early september 
the report was prepared under the guidance of rear adm richard 
milligan and was sent last weel to top officials at the pentagon 
where it is being reviewed by a very tightly controlled group of 
people another pentagon source said 
only a few people currently are working on it as far as i know 
there are no civilians in the group and its next stop will be on 
the desk of the chief of naval operations the source said 
however the defense official said he was told the report will 
show a number of lapses in procedures but he said he could not 
identify them 
the investigation found various things wrong about procedures 
but none of them has been found to be the cause the official said 
the official said the investigation has gone deeply into details 
of the ships operations which means multiple problems could be 
found in such a complex operation as a battleship firing its guns 
there were lapses in procedures but to cite just maintenance 
problems would be nitpicking it does not point to the cause of the 
problem the official said

a south texas city is fighting to protect the 
springs that make it a desert oasis from a pentagon proposal to rock 
a nearby ranch with a series of massive underground explosions 
the proposed explosions on the buck king ranch near del rio 
texas are an important element in us strategic deterrent 
capabilities says the defense nuclear agency 
the nonnuclear explosions are designed to simulate the impact of 
nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and military command 
centers 
but 12000 of the 40000 del rio residents have signed petitions 
asking the agency to take its explosives elsewhere they say they 
dont want to take any chances with the texas border citys only 
source of water the san felipe springs 
we depend on san felipe springs for survival says city 
manager jeffrey pomeranz the city of del rio is not willing to 
play a whatif game with our water and the future of our city 
no one in washington has offered us any guarantees nor can 
they that if our water supply was adversely affected the federal 
government would step in and correct the situation he said 
mexico also has expressed concern to us officials about the 
potential impact of the explosions near the border said leonardo 
french a spokesman for the mexican embassy 
defense nuclear agency officials however say a final decision 
to conduct the tests hinges on geological and environmental 
assessments of the area that are not yet completed 
the agency spent two years choosing the site 25 miles north of 
del rio for the graduated series of explosions 
the explosions would start with a 1000pound charge in 1990 
increasing to 470 tons equivalent to 300 tons of tnt in november 
1992 
defense spokeswoman cheri abdelnour said the tests would be 
performed with the same conventional explosives used by the mining 
industry and do not involve nuclear or radioactive devices 
jack m bachkosky director of plans programs and requirements 
for the defense agency said the tests are important to the 
continued credibility and viability of our strategic deterrent 
as an agency our primary responsibility to the department of 
defense is to ensure the survivability of our strategic assets and 
the effectiveness of those same assets when used against anyone who 
might threaten our security he said 
del rio officials were told the purpose of the tests was to 
determine the survivability of underground missile silos and 
foreign missile silos and other underground military facilities 
pomeranz said 
but del rio residents say water in west texas is more important 
last week they became even more skittish when an underground cavein 
contaminated their water with an unknown substance forcing them to 
drink boiled or bottled water for two days 
just as the springs are tied to the citys future they are part 
of its past with the first spanish explorers writing about the 
springs in their chronicles long before it was settled del rio was 
an oasis on the long dry trail between san antonio and san diego 
pomeranz said 
del rios entire growth and development is centered around the 
san felipe springs pomeranz said 
on friday pomeranz and mayor alfred gutierrez jr met with 
bachkosky and vice adm john t parker jr defense nuclear agency 
director to ask that the drilling for the core samples be abandoned 
what were saying is weve got 12000 signatures of del rioans 
who want the project stopped and the city of del rio is going to do 
everything possible to protect our citizens pomeranz said 
therefore lets stop the test drilling now and look for another 
site

federal reserve policymakers meeting privately 
today likely will decide against lowering interest rates soon 
despite pressure from the bush administration analysts say 
the federal open market committee which controls the benchmark 
federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans 
is devising the central banks monetary strategy for the next six 
weeks 
but as usual under the committees procedure the results wont 
be publicly disclosed until oct 6 three days after the next 
meeting 
most analysts expected the fed to hold interest rates steady 
unless it sees unexpected signs that economic growth is fizzling 
i dont think theyre going to do much of anything right now 
said economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets 
they can say their policies are working pretty much as desired 
the economy is still moving up and the inflation numbers have been 
fairly good 
the central bank which tries to regulate the nations economy by 
manipulating interest rates has been engaged in a delicate 
balancing act over the past 18 months 
it is trying to hold inflation in check by moderating economic 
growth but at the same time keep the country from toppling into what 
would be the first recession since 1982 
president bush tried last week to tip the balance in favor of 
lower rates which would stimulate economic growth and revenue to 
the government bush endorsed comments by his budget director 
richard darman who said it would be the feds fault if the economy 
falls into a recession 
steinberg however warned that such lobbying of the fed a 
fiercely independent agency may backfire 
if anything it causes them to dig in their heels he said 
the fed believes economic growth of only a little more than 2 
percent a year is sustainable without fueling inflation but the 
administration is looking for growth closer to 3 percent this year 
to help it reduce the federal budget deficit 
in a 5 trillion economy thats not peanuts said david 
jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in 
new york in fact for every 1 percent increase in growth mr 
darman gets an extra 25 billion in revenue to help ease the budget 
deficit 
jones said there is a split in the 12member fomc which consists 
of seven federal reserve board governors although there is one 
vacancy and five presidents of regional federal reserve banks 
board members have tended to favor easier money while regional 
bank presidents have leaned toward tighter policy he said 
board member wayne angell told the kansas livestock association 
on friday that he believed the fed has succeeded in curbing 
inflation which he predicted would decline from about 5 percent a 
year to about 3 percent 
earlier last week however lee hoskins president of the federal 
reserve bank of cleveland and gary stern president of the fed in 
minneapolis told bankers at a university of wisconsin forum that 
they believed economic growth was accelerating a sign that 
inflation wont subside 
at least for now its hard to say for sure which faction is 
right economists say the fed only recently began easing its tight 
money policy 
from march 1988 to march 1989 the fed pushed shortterm interest 
rates up by 3 percentage points in an effort to curb the economy and 
bring inflationary pressures under control 
it paused for several months and then in early june as signs of 
sluggish growth emerged reversed course and began to push rates 
lower 
now as economic reports come in for july it appears the fed has 
exactly what it wants the most recent data suggests the economy has 
recovered a bit from sluggishness in the apriljune quarter 
the feds index of industrial production rose in july after 
falling the two previous months and new home construction rebounded 
in june and july from four consecutive monthly declines 
consumer price inflation which from january through may soared 
at the worst rate in seven years averaging 05 percent to 06 
percent each month fell to 02 percent in both june and july

when a new home is offered for sale even in 
the heart of bigcity suburbia it very often adds to farm income 
with an eyecatching display of freshly planted shrubs and green sod 
almost ready to mow 
add cut flowers and floral arrangements for weddings funerals 
lovers aunt sophie and sick friends and you have horticulture one 
of the fastest developing sectors in us agriculture 
since 1982 says an agriculture department economist the 
horticulture industry has grown an average of 10 percent a year 
preliminary figures for 1988 show that producers of horticultural 
products had cash receipts totaling 69 billion which was more 
than 9 percent of the 724 billion received by farmers last year 
for all crops 
for example according to usda statistics the 69 billion for 
flowers shrubs sod and other greenery exceed 1988 cash receipts 
for cotton 47 billion and tobacco 204 billion and was 
creeping up on feed crops including corn 768 billion 
doyle johnson of the departments economic research service said 
the industry was in two sectors floriculture includes cut flowers 
potted flowering plants bedding plants and cut cultivated greens 
such as ferns used in arrangements 
the other is environmental horticulture which includes all other 
nursery and greenhouse products 
johnsons analysis of the rapid growth of the horticulture 
industry is in the september issue of farmline magazine 
one of the reasons for the increase in horticultural sales is 
that the housing industry is spending more for sod and other 
landscape ornamentals the report said also cities are doing 
more landscaping in the inner cities as well as in parks and along 
highways 
california accounts for about 23 percent of total horticultural 
sales followed by florida nearly 15 percent and texas 7 percent 
of 2 million farms in the united states there are fewer than 
38000 horticultural operations but in 1987 the most recent 
statistics available those had sales averaging 154818 each 
compared with 65165 for all farms 
there are an estimated 57000 retail floral outlets in the united 
states the report said massmarket outlets mostly grocery stores 
account for 21000 but the majority an estimated 36000 are 
independent retail floral shops 
according to 1986 figures grocery store sales of flowers and 
plants amounted to 149 billion averaging 28 per square feet of 
store space compared with 8 to 12 for other produce the report 
said 
the united states is the worlds largest producer of flowers and 
plants and american growers control about 95 percent of the 
domestic market the report said but imports are important 
totaling 451 million last year 
colombia is the largest source of the imports the report said 
others include the netherlands canada costa rica and mexico

british wine drinkers offer a potential growth 
market for us producers the agriculture department says 
robert fondahn the us agricultural trade officer in london 
says per capita wine consumption in the united kingdom grew from 2 
liters in 1967 to 12 liters in 1987 
it currently is the only growth market in europe for wine he 
said with 41 supplying countries the united kingdom has become 
the most sought after wine market in the world 
fondahn said in the september issue of agexporter magazine that 
the uk imports 574 million cases of wine annually compared with 
domestic production of 94 million cases 
although the us market share is less than 1 percent last 
years sales of american wine to the uk rose 20 percent to 550000 
cases he said 
consumers prefer white wines over red although there has been 
substantial increases in red and rose wines lately 
the most dramatic development in wine sales in recent years has 
been the establishment of wine bars fondahn said these 
establishments have introduced a large segment of the population to 
a variety of wines many of the wine bars offer their wines by the 
case for home consumption 
fondahn said that as a member of the european economic community 
the uk must comply with eec requirements for the importation of 
wine 
these requirements can be stringent and in some cases can 
hinder the sale of us wine in the uk he said

the nations battles against drugs aids tax 
cheats and dangerous airways could be undermined unless congress 
implements an agreement to cut the budget deficit the bush 
administration says 
such spending programs may have to be arbitrarily cut and 81 
billion taken from the military budget unless the 1990 deficit is 
reduced to the level allowed by law says richard g darman 
director of the office of management and budget 
however in a report to president bush and congress on monday 
darman said acrosstheboard spending cuts are avoidable 
it remains my hope and my cautiously optimistic expectation 
that necessary legislation cutting selected programs and raising 
revenues can be enacted when congress returns sept 5 darman said 
the government can avoid the acrosstheboard reductions if 
congress will implement a budgetcutting agreement reached with bush 
in april darman said he noted that almost none of that agreement 
has been enacted into law 
the deficit is on a path that in the absence of further 
congressional action would lead to 1162 billion of red ink during 
the 1990 budget year which begins oct 1 thats down from about 
170 billion this year 
the law limits the 1990 deficit to 100 billion 
as a result of the estimate darman told reporters bush will 
issue an order friday to cut sequester in washington jargon 
162 billion worth of spending half from the military budget and 
half from most nonmilitary programs but that order will be only a 
warning the real cuts would not be ordered until oct 15 
in his report darman listed specific cuts that would be required 
in specific programs ranging from a 1 billion slash in salaries 
and benefits for the army to a 7 million reduction in health 
benefits for retired federal workers 
among the effects that could occur darman said are

a cut below this years level in funds for the drug enforcement 
administration which could undermine its ability to wage an 
aggressive war on drugs the coast guard might have to ground 
aircraft needed for critical interdiction activities 
reductions would severely hamper the public health services 
efforts to prevent hiv the aids virus transmission and conduct 
research into therapies and vaccines 
the effect on the federal aviation administration could 
include a furlough of up to three days per month of all faa staff 
including air traffic control and maintenance personnel 
internal revenue service funding would be reduced the agency 
could lose 4700 workers meaning 10 million fewer 
taxpayerassistance calls could be answered and fewer returns could 
be audited 
about 1 million needy college students would lose federal 
education grants 
the defense department might be forced to cut 160000 personnel 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican on the house 
budget committee predicted that once the smoke clears congress 
is going to lurch across the finish line and avoid the arbitrary 
cuts 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the committee cautioned 
that congress should not be lulled to sleep by ombs artificially 
low deficit projections even with these dubious economic and 
spending assumptions we face the possibility of harsh 
acrosstheboard spending cuts this fall and we still need 
30 billion to 60 billion in additional deficit reduction for 
1991 
darman also noted a greater effort will be required a year from 
now to cut the deficit further but bushs opposition to a tax 
increase is unchanged he said 
we still say revenues tax increases dont have to be on the 
negotiating table for 1991

try again slightly sooner than those who start with a daughter they 
report in the august edition of demography the journal of the 
population association of america 
the american norm really is a boygirl family schollaert of 
old dominion university in norfolk va said in a telephone 
interview 
that finding he added could ease fears that the ability to 
select the gender of children could lead to an excess of boys 
our results are straightforward the gender of children affects 
birth timing yet it is not whether a child is a boy or a girl that 
is important reported teachman and schollaert 
women with two boys or two girls are more likely to time a 
third birth rapidly than are women with a boy and a girl they 
said 
their conclusions were based on an analysis of births to more 
than 2000 women reported in the national survey of family growth 
in 1973 1976 and 1982 
by recording births every six months they were able to compare 
whether women in one group had births before those in other groups 
they did not report the actual length of time between births 
however 
were they surprised that parents who had sons first were quicker 
to have a second child than those who had a daughter first 
oh we were responded schollaert 
in many societies there is a strong preference for boys leading 
to the killing of female babies in some countries schollaert said 
past studies in this country have indicated a slight preference 
for boys so logic is that if you tried once and had a daughter 
youd be more likely to go try again quickly he said 
what we found to the contrary was that those who had sons 
were more likely to have a rapid second birth he said 
however he explained that the slight preference for boys still 
might be the reason 
schollaert said he and teachman found that couples that have 
sons are slightly more likely to stay married and of course the 
most powerful determinant of whether you have another child in short 
order is are you married 
tradition has it that people prefer boys and that slight 
preference in american society has a bearing he said 
fathers are more likely to be involved with their sons than 
their daughters this involvement leads to greater familial ties and 
interdependencies that work against marital dissolution said 
teachman and schollaert studies have found that parents who have a 
daughter first are somewhat more likely to divorce than those who 
have a son 
thus women with sons were more likely to remain married and to 
have a second child women with daughters being more likely to be 
divorced or separated had a reduced likelihood of having second 
children they concluded

the federal reserve board is passing up an 
opportunity to penalize japaneseowned securities companies in the 
united states instead praising tokyo for making substantial 
progress in opening its markets to us companies 
the board voted 51 monday to allow japaneseowned companies to 
continue operating as primary dealers of us treasury debt a staff 
report concluded the japanese government offered us companies a 
fair chance to participate in its debt sales 
much progress has been made the report said the structure 
of the japanese market now compares favorably with the state of 
development in other industrial countries and the actions that have 
been taken in recent years to open the market are substantial 
in the united states any company may buy treasury debt however 
only 42 11 fully or partly japaneseowned are designated by the 
federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers eligible to 
trade securities with the central bank as part of its regulation of 
the economy 
omnibus trade legislation passed by congress a year ago required 
the federal reserve to remove foreignowned companies from the 
primary dealer list if their nations didnt afford the same 
competitive opportunities to us companies 
the united states runs a persistent deficit with japan in the 
trade of goods one of the ways it makes up part of that gap is 
through the trade of services such as those offered by securities 
companies 
rep charles schumer dny who pushed for the securities 
provision in the trade bill said he agreed japan had made enough 
progress to avoid sanctions however he said the central bank 
should have been more critical 
the feds decision that japans markets are fully competitive 
is premature he said in a statement while i agree japan has 
made progress the markets are not even close to fully 
competitive 
legislators have warned that unless the united states insists on 
full access to japanese financial markets the us brokerage 
industry will slip behind in international competition as have us 
auto and steel companies 
the fed staff conceded the barriers to us participation in 
japanese government debt markets had existed but noted a major 
improvement this year 
in april japan began selling 40 percent of its 10year bonds 
the most important government security issued through a competitive 
auction leaving 60 percent to be sold through negotiation with a 
syndicate of securities companies and banks 
previously all 10year bonds had been sold through the 
syndicate the staff also noted that foreign participation in the 
syndicate has increased from about 1 percent in 1986 to 8 percent 
last year 
the japanese buy about a third of the us governments longterm 
bonds according to analysts 
board member martha seger dissented noting that the law requires 
japan to offer the same competitive opportunities not simply to 
improve 
in particular us companies still complain that japanese 
officials provide advance information to japanese companies on 
government economic data putting other companies at a disadvantage 
however the central bank staff said the japanese have taken 
steps to curb this abuse and that further steps are expected

the federal deficit through july is running 13 
percent behind last year but analysts and the government say 
savings and loan bailout spending will swell the budget gap in 
august and september 
the treasury department said monday that the government posted a 
smallerthanexpected deficit of 182 billion in july the 10th 
month of the fiscal year ending sept 30 
it attributed the 204 percent decline from july 1988 to a shift 
in payment dates for military salaries veterans benefits and 
supplemental security income those payments normally made july 1 
were shifted to june 30 because july 1 fell on a saturday 
the shift caused the government to record a smallerthanusual 
78 billion surplus in june normally a more positive month because 
people and corporations make quarterly tax payments 
through july the deficit totals 1238 billion 13 percent lower 
than the same period for fiscal 1988 
this is a good newsbad news story said economist david 
jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in 
new york the good news is the july deficit is lower than 
expected the bad news is that august and september will see 
substantial increases in treasury borrowing because of the sampl 
bailout 
the thrift rescue law signed by president bush on aug 9 will add 
20 billion in borrowing so far this month the treasury has 
expanded its borrowing by 5 billion and officials say they intend 
to borrow the remaining 15 billion in the next six weeks 
the bush administration had been forecasting a 1989 deficit of 
1483 billion an improvement over the 1988 red ink of 1552 
billion but budget director richard darman said monday the 
administration expects just under 170 billion in red ink the 
congressional budget office forecasts a 161 billion deficit for 
this year 
revenue last month totaled 663 billion up 92 percent from a 
year ago while spending was up only 11 percent to 845 billion 
as usual the governments largest spending category last month 
was military spending which totaled 205 billion in july and 
2418 billion so far this year up 2 percent from 1988 
other large spending categories were 
interest on the national debt the fastest growing item 16 
billion last month and 2073 billion so far in fiscal 1989 up 129 
percent from the previous year 
social security 186 billion in july and 1887 billion so far 
this year up 6 percent from 1988 
other programs in the department of health and human services 
131 billion last month and 1416 billion so far in 1989 up 83 
percent from a year earlier

energy secretary james d watkins is offering 
to negotiate with 11 governors over environmental monitoring of 
federal nuclear facilities within their borders 
the states california ohio florida idaho missouri nevada 
new mexico south carolina tennessee texas and washington are 
hosts to a variety of energy department defense nuclear facilities 
including nuclear reactors processing plants weapons assembly 
facilities and waste treatment and storage operations 
the department said monday that it wanted to reach agreements 
that would allow the states to independently validate the 
departments own environmental monitoring data and to involve the 
states in setting priorities and schedules for nuclear waste cleanup 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary said the proposed 
agreements would be unprecedented in their scope and in the degree 
of access to doe facilities that will be provided to the states 
he said the accords would be similar to a model agreement signed 
june 28 by watkins and colorado gov roy romer over state access to 
the rocky flats nuclear plant near denver 
the reagan administration had vigorously opposed state actions to 
enforce hazardous waste laws at defense nuclear facilities but 
president bush has taken a more accommodating view in the wake of 
disclosures about mismanagement and possible criminal violations of 
environmental laws at some plants

the administration is studying a classified 
report on the feasibility of establishing us bases in singapore a 
state department official says 
the report compiled by a technical military team that visited 
the tiny asian citystate in june was submitted to the chief of the 
joint chiefs of staff and other government agencies a department 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said monday 
state department spokesman richard boucher said the united states 
and singapore have been discussing the possibility of greater 
security cooperation for some time weve made no decisions nor 
any commitments with regard to how we might follow up on these 
discussions 
the report comes as the administration prepares to negotiate with 
the philippines to renew the lease of six us military facilities 
that expire in 1991 
boucher said the discussions with singapore were not linked with 
the philippines talks 
other officials say singapore would be far too small to hold 
clark air base the subic bay naval base and the four other 
philippine bases 
singapore is attractive in its own right due to its strategic 
location on the pacific an official said 
singapore earlier this month made public its offer to accept some 
us facilities

creative financing such as taxes on polluters 
should be considered to pay for the multibilliondollar cost of 
cleaning up the great lakes a new study says 
the northeastmidwest institute which does research for members 
of congress from 18 states estimated that up to 34 billion will 
be needed to restore 10 of the lakes dirtiest areas 
the real challenge right now is how to pay for the 
cleanup michael j donahue executive director of the great lakes 
commission in ann arbor mich said monday 
federal funds are available through a variety of programs to help 
with the cleanup such as the superfund for toxic wastes but the 
institute report urges congress to establish a trust fund or 
aquafund with money from new taxes on water users and 
manufacturers of the chemicals found in harbor and river sediment 
a uscanadian commission has classified 42 areas as so polluted 
they are unfit for swimming drinking fishing and in some cases 
navigation 
estimates of cleanup costs have been made for 10 of those areas 
fox rivergreen bay and milwaukee harbor in wisconsin waukegan 
harbor in illinois grand calumet riverindiana harbor in indiana 
saginaw riversaginaw bay clinton river and rouge river all in 
michigan black river and ashtabula riverharbor in ohio and 
rochester embayment in new york 
the estimated cost of cleaning up all 10 areas is 29 billion to 
34 billion the report said however it said that estimate is 
probably too low because cleanup costs have been set for only 19 of 
the 55 contamination sources identified at the sites

procedures aboard the uss iowa are the focus of 
a navy investigation into an explosion that killed 47 sailors but a 
defense department official says the specific cause of the blast 
cant be determined 
reports published in the washington post and the daily press of 
newport news va say the navy report found that crew members 
failed to perform preventive maintenance and that sailors werent 
properly certified for their jobs 
the navy which says the report on the april 19 explosion will be 
made public next month refused to comment on either story 
as far as were concerned its all still under 
investigation said navy spokesman cmdr mark baker 
the defense department official who spoke monday on condition of 
anonymity said the navy report does not point to the cause of the 
problem the report cites a probability 
the washington post reported in todays editions that the 
investigation has found the crew failed to perform certain 
unspecified preventive maintenance procedures however the 
newspaper said it was not known whether the faulty maintenance 
caused the explosion 
the no 2 turrets guns passed prefiring checks before the 
explosion the post said 
the daily press reported monday that the navy failed to properly 
qualify the sailors who worked with explosives in the turret 
navy regulations require that all sailors and civilian employees 
who work with explosives be certified at their posts by a 
qualification board sailors who lack certification are permitted to 
handle weapons only in the presence of a supervisor 
michael drowns one of 11 sailors who escaped turret no 2 after 
the explosion told the daily press that a qualification board was 
never convened during his three years on the iowa drowns received 
an honorable discharge from the navy aug 11 
other iowa sailors and a navy officer familiar with the 
investigation confirmed drowns statements but asked that they not 
be identified for fear of retribution by the navy 
adm richard milligan who headed the navys probe said no 
records of a qualification board had been found on the iowa a 
source told the daily press milligan has declined to comment 
publicly 
nbc news reported last month that investigators believed the 
explosion was the result of suicidal sabotage by gunners mate 
clayton hartwig navy spokesman lt greg smith said july 19 that the 
conclusion of suicide was not based on official navy reports 
the defense official said monday that he was told the report 
would show a number of lapses in procedures but he said he 
could not identify them 
the investigation found various things wrong about procedures 
but none of them has been found to be the cause he said 
the investigation has gone into details of the ships operations 
which means multiple problems could be found in such a complex 
operation as a battleship firing its guns he said 
there were lapses in procedures but to cite just maintenance 
problems would be nitpicking it does not point to the cause of the 
problem the official said 
drowns and another survivor gunners mate 2nd class john 
mullahy said the turrets senior enlisted man senior chief 
gunners mate reginald o ziegler was concerned before the 
explosion about the lack of qualification booklets 
ziegler one of the 47 sailors who died had given photocopied 
pages of the performance qualification standard booklets to some 
sailors 
navy regulations require that sailors have the books 
mullahy and another survivor gunners mate 3rd class kendall 
truitt said one of the sailors who lacked a book was gunners mate 
3rd class robert w backherms the rammerman of the center gun where 
the explosion occurred 
truitt said backherms joined the ship shortly after christmas 
was inexperienced and may have caused the blast by ramming the bags 
of explosives into the gun too fast

try jim bakker while the ptl founders wife pleaded on the couples 
television show for money from the faithful 
the jury selected monday includes baptists presbyterians and 
catholics most of whom said they attend church regularly and give 
to their church but do not watch ptl or other religious television 
programs 
our faith is in god bakker proclaimed as he strode into the 
us district courthouse with his attorneys and daughter 
back in orlando fla bakkers wife tammy faye carried on 
their live television broadcast urging viewers to send money and 
pray for her husband 
everything that has to do with christian television is on trial

dortch who was indicted with bakker pleaded guilty to charges of 
fraud and conspiracy last month former bakker aides james and 
david taggart were convicted of tax evasion all three are potential 
government witnesses 
in jury selection monday us district court judge robert potter 
questioned 49 people about their religious affiliation whether they 
had ever donated to television evangelists how regularly they 
attended church and whether they had ever been born again had a 
deep religious experience or felt they had been called by god into a 
vocation 
seven jurors were dismissed including four who said they could 
not put aside their opinions to give bakker a fair trial 
potter warned the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone 
before opening arguments begin next monday prosecutors and defense 
attorneys are under a gag order imposed by potter and would not 
discuss jury selection 
bakker left by a side door after jury selection was completed

strategy but he has said he knew little about ptls finances 
mrs bakker stayed in orlando where bakker transplanted his

told viewers 
the bakkers have pleaded with supporters to contribute 1 million 
for bakkers defense fund a letter sent two months ago said half of 
that amount had to be raised by the end of the month 
ministry officials have declined to say how much has been raised 
it was earlier appeals for 1000 donations to buy lifetime 
partnerships at the ptl ministry that landed bakker in federal 
court 
prosecutors say he and top aides at the heritage usa ministry 
diverted more than 4 million of the 158 million contributed under 
various partnership programs to their personal uses 
the bakkers lived in a 13 million parsonage in tega cay sc 
where they had an airconditioned dog house their condo in florida 
had goldplated faucets and mirrored walls that would give a view of 
the ocean from all directions

palestinians are in a state of political turmoil 
as sharp differences have emerged over the future direction of the 
20monthold uprising against israeli occupation 
the tensions which coincided with greater violence aimed at 
israelis and among palestinians themselves come at a time of rising 
frustration over the lack of progress in the usplo dialogue and 
in efforts to arrange negotiations with israel 
prominent palestinians argue the internal debate has not shaken 
the underlying commitment to continue the intefadeh or uprising as 
the only way to spur negotiations and achieve an independent state 
internally we have some difficulties we are in the midst of a 
reevaluation of our tactics but the dialogue is healthy said 
ghassan khatib a lecturer at bir zeit university in the west bank 
leftists are urging the plo to make no further compromises on the 
diplomatic front and some are pushing for more violent actions 
such as the use of weapons to pressure israel in what they see as a 
longterm war of attrition 
at the same time some of the uprisings more ambitious tactics 
have flopped increasing fears among some palestinians that the 
credibility of the underground leadership could be undermined 
for example many workers in the west bank ignored a call from 
the proplo underground to stage a weeklong sympathy strike for 
collegues in the gaza strip who were refusing to accept new israeli 
identity cards 
the leadership shouldnt make calls that they cant 
implement said khatib 
disunity also arose recently in public in several west bank 
schools where plo chief yasser arafats followers urged students to 
attend classes during a general strike and met opposition from 
leftists who feared it would undermine solidarity 
in al askar refugee camp about 150 supporters of arafats 
mainstream fatah wearing black headdresses engaged in fistfights 
over the school issue with 50 members of marxist plo factions 
wearing red headdresses 
daoud kuttab a palestinian journalist said lack of 
discipline in the uprising also was apparent in a new tendency by 
palestinians to break with a publicly proclaimed plo policy of 
restraint and launch individual actions some of them violent 
the underground leadership is asking people daily to sacrifice 
their lives but people are not seeing tangible changes and their 
endurance and patience with the leadership becomes thin kuttab 
said 
as a result he said there were more uncontrolled actions 
such as the lone palestinian who to avenge the beating of a friend 
by soldiers forced a bus off a highway july 6 killing 16 jews and 
injuring 25 others 
despite a plo order not to use weapons army statistics obtained 
by the associated press show there were 12 incidents of palestinians 
using firearms against israelis and alleged arab collaborators from 
july 9 to aug 9 more than in all of 1988 
overall there also appears to be a new hard line developing 
at an eightday conference in tunisia this month arafats fatah 
produced a final communique reaffirming the guerrilla factions 
commitment to armed struggle the statement contrasted with arafats 
earlier pledges to abandon terror and accept israel 
arafat also hinted to reporters in baghdad that more violent 
actions were under consideration saying a lack of progress in the 
usplo talks could result in the uprising becoming a nationwide 
rebellion and we may take another step after the rebellion 
the more militant mood was also evident in the latest leaflet 
issued by the plobacked united national leadership of the uprising 
it advocated a greater use of knives in attacks on israelis 
the communique also reflected leftist views in taking an 
unexpectedly strong position against palestinians meeting with 
israeli officials such as prime minister yitzhak shamir and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin 
jamil tarifi a west bank lawyer from ramallah left for jordan 
and skipped a planned conference with visiting us assistant 
secretary of state john kelly after graffiti threatened his life for 
earlier meeting with shamir 
shame on jamil tarifi and anybody who meets with killers of our 
people said one slogan on a wall in ramallah 
assad saftawi of gaza city a palestinian activist with close 
ties to arafat said that despite the warning he would press ahead 
with a 10point peace proposal he recently presented to rabin 
i call on my brothers not to be quick in taking decisions 
before they see the results of such meetings he said in an 
interview 
other signs of internal upheaval include leaflets accusing 
prominent activists of corruption and a surge of attacks on 
palestinians who are accused of collaborating with israel 
the attacks usually carried out at night by masked enforcers 
have claimed 97 lives and been criticized as harming the uprisings 
nonviolent image israeli troops have killed 540 palestinians 
during the uprising which began dec 8 1987 
the rev audeh rantisi former deputy mayor of ramallah said in 
an interview that its not right to take the life of anyone 
adding some killings may mask personal rivalries

the fbi has been called in to help investigate the 
mailing of a gas bomb to the southeastern regional headquarters of 
the naacp in what is believed to have been a racially motivated 
attack 
eight people including a 4monthold were injured when the bomb 
went off monday as workers at the naacp office opened a package that 
arrived by mail earlier that morning 
caustic gas similar to tear gas spread from the office of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
through airconditioning ducts into surrounding offices in a 
twostory brick building near downtown atlanta said assistant fire 
chief walter campbell 
no one was seriously hurt according to officials at grady 
memorial hospital and georgia baptist medical center 
officers from the postal service the fbi the atlanta police and 
the atlanta fire bureau arson squad were investigating the bombing 
campbell said 
well be looking to see what jurisdiction if any weve got 
our interest is from the point of view of civil rights said 
fbi special agent diader rosario 
anytime something like this would come to the naacp office you 
have to believe its racially motivated said democratic rep john 
lewis a veteran of the civil rights movement who was speaking 
nearby to a community group when he heard about the bombing 
this is just a terrible experience said murlene murray a 
staff secretary in the office weve never experienced anything 
like this before in the 20 years ive worked here 
the package arrived via postal service priority mail 
shinhoster said it was addressed to the naacp and not to anyone in 
particular 
the return address proved to be a law office on peachtree street 
in downtown atlanta police interviewed people at the firm but said 
they suspect the address was listed as a hoax

black community leaders citing racial 
factors in legal proceedings against the nations longeststanding 
death row inmate are urging that his life be spared 
william andrews on death row nearly 15 years had faced 
execution today for his role in the torturemurders of three whites 
at an ogden stereo shop the victims and two survivors were forced 
to drink liquid drain cleaner before being shot in the head 
the 34yearold former airman from jonesboro la won a reprieve 
saturday when a federal appellate court ordered a stay based on a 
writ of habeas corpus that claimed the court showed a racial bias in 
excluding a black man as a juror in andrews trial 
james gillespie sr president of the ogden chapter of the naacp 
and father of the juror who was excluded said the death sentence 
reflects prevailing attitudes in utah which he labeled a racist 
state 
thenprosecutor robert newey has acknowledged that race played a 
part in his decision to exclude james gillespie jr as a juror 
defense attorneys incorporated that statement into their appeal 
but the state has countered that andrews trial attorney concurred 
in a motion to dismiss the younger gillespie because he was a state 
lawman at the time 
the younger gillespie now an administrator in the state prison 
system has not disputed the logic behind his exclusion as a juror 
but said race had played a part in the case 
in his writ that led to the stay by the 10th circuit court of 
appeal andrews argued that a mistrial should have been declared 
during his trial when a juror found a note in a restaurant during a 
lunch break saying hang the niggers the juror gave the note to 
the judge its origin was never determined 
the elder gillespie noted that avowed white supremacist joseph 
paul franklin had been sentenced to life imprisonment for gunning 
down two black men ted fields and david martin at a salt lake city 
park in 1980 
no one seemed upset when mrs fields and mrs martins sons 
were killed gillespie said that was premeditated murder 
he said andrews had gotten the death sentence because its a 
black person that killed a white person 
franklin convicted of two counts of firstdegree murder was 
given concurrent life sentences when the jury could not agree on the 
death penalty he also was convicted in federal court and is serving 
life terms for violating the victims civil rights 
martins mother johnnie maye martin attended a service sunday 
at the calvary baptist church saying she had come to pray for 
andrews his family and all black children because there is no 
justice for them 
utah is a pretty good state yes if you are white said 
alberta henry of the salt lake chapter of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people william andrews he may 
still die even after this stay but god help utah if he does for 
utah will never live it down 
university of utah political science professor jd williams a 
civil right activist said he did not feel race was the dominant 
issue in the case 
he noted that andrews and his codefendant pierre dale selby 
who was executed in 1987 together forced their bound victims to 
drink caustic drain cleaner moreover he said a woman was raped 
and one of the survivors had a pen kicked into his ear 
pencils drano rape and murder shocking and indefensible 
crimes said williams who opposed capital punishment on 
principle it was not racism it was heinous crime 
calvary baptist pastor france davis said racial attitudes in 
utah where 923 percent of the 17 million population is white 
stem from the mormon churchs history of barring black men from the 
lay priesthood 
it wasnt until 1978 that thenpresident spencer kimball opened 
the clergy to blacks about 70 percent of utahns are mormons 
andrews long stay on death row stems from utahs lengthy review 
policy for capital cases besides selby the two previous executions 
occurred after the criminals had abandoned the appeals process

a government historian reversed the 
official view of polands most painful wartime memory and blamed 
the soviet union for the world war ii massacre of polish soliders at 
katyn 
jarema maciszewski polands chairman of a polishsoviet 
commission set up to investigate blank spots in history said 
there was no doubt the soviets were responsible the state pap 
news service reported monday 
it was the first direct statement from the commission on the 
subject and appeared the culmination of polands yearlong 
reassessment of the masssacre of 15000 polish officers at katyn and 
two other soviet camps 
the official soviet and polish version had been that the officers 
were shot by the nazis in 1941 after germany invaded the soviet 
union 
maciszewski said a communique from the 1944 soviet burdenko 
commission that investigated the slaying is false he said it was 
contradicted by other information including evidence from nuremberg 
trial investigations and red cross representatives 
poland had said earlier that circumstantial evidence pointed to 
soviet guilt but maciszewskis conclusions published in the aug 19 
issue of polityka and reported by pap said soviet responsibility 
was definite 
there is no doubt about the burdenko commissions opinions 
departing from the truth or about full responsibility of the soviet 
secret police for the katyn crime and the deaths of the officers at 
the starobelsk and ostashkov camps pap quoted macizewski as 
saying 
about 4000 officers the cream of polish society called up from 
the reserves and interned by the soviets shortly after the outbreak 
of the war were shot in the back of the head and dumped in mass 
graves in katyn near the soviet city of smolensk 
the fate of the remaining officers interned at two other soviet 
camps has never been revealed they also are presumed to have been 
executed 
historians in the west and most poles have long believed the men 
were killed on stalins orders in spring 1940 
the katyn massacre is considered the most vivid symbol of soviet 
atrocities against poland during the war 
for decades katyn was a taboo subject in poland and a permanent 
monument to the victims was not allowed until 1985 
the polishsoviet commission has reported tentative findings but 
has yet to present a final report polish historians have called on 
the soviet union to open its archives to resolve all questions 
surrounding the crime

officials made a mistake counting votes on 
a riverboat gambling initiative it was announced monday and the 
revised results show that only one of three counties voted in favor 
of authorizing the gambling 
two other counties along the mississippi rivewr were voting 
tuesday on the measure and four other river counties will vote next 
week 
an official canvass showed that election officials in one clayton 
county precinct reversed the yes and no votes in last weeks 
referendum to authorize floating casinos when the error was 
discovered the new total showed the measure lost in the county by a 
91vote margin said gerald palas a member of the county board of 
supervisors 
dubuque county voted in favor of the referendum lee and des 
moines counties vote on the measure tuesday 
iowas riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion boats 
beginning april 1 1991 in counties where voters first approve it 
in a referendum 
last week voters in dubuque approved the referendum by a 21 
margin the issue was rejected by voters in allamakee county and 
initially election officials in clayton county said it was approved 
by a vote of 1122 to 1060 
but palas said that those results from the aug 15 election 
reflected a mixup in cass township which first reported gambling 
was approved 13054 the canvass determined the actual vote should 
have been reversed in that precinct leaving the issue defeated 
countywide by a vote of 1046 for floating casinos to 1137 against 
next week voters in scott clinton muscatine and jackson 
counties will vote on the proposal

the nations only university institute to study 
gambling has opened here as more local governments legalize what 
some people still view as a vice 
some people still look at gaming as quite a ways down on the 
morality list said judy cornelius acting associate director of 
the institute but the attitude toward gaming is definitely 
changing as states see this as a legal way to generate revenue 
ms cornelius said monday that only three states do not have 
some form of legalized gambling hawaii indiana and utah 
the new institute for the study of gambling and commercial 
gaming which plans to offer undergraduate minor degrees opened 
july 1 at the university of nevadareno 
the institute is relly intended to be an umbrella organization 
that will further the understanding of gamblings effects on 
society said unr economics professor william eadington an 
analyst of the gaming industry which provides more than half of 
nevadas funds to run state government 
the reno institute will focus not only on economic gaming issues 
but also will delve into ethical moral and legal issues to discover 
why people gamble and why sometimes they become addicted to risk 
taking 
theres so much gaming activity going on now that there needs 
to be a research center where information from all over the world 
can be gathered ms cornelius said 
in the education area the institute plans to start slowly by 
offering nondegree courses through the unr division of continuing 
education this fall for people involved in the casino industry at 
middle management positions 
then existing gaming and gamblingrelated university courses 
will be consolidated into the equivalent of an undergraduate minor 
with a specialization in gambling or casino management 
gaming really is big business all over the world now ms 
cornelius said even in the midwest where charitable gaming is 
really big 
voters in an iowa county recently approved riverboat gambling and 
deadwood sd has approved casino games 
in some areas where there has been resistance to legalized 
gambling people are approving games of chance with the caveat that 
the business operators also tell people how to get help if theyre 
addicted to gambling ms cornelius said 
theres a new trend in lotteries in which a small percentage of 
the money is earmarked toward treatment of pathological gambling 
she said adding that some lottery machines must have on them phone 
numbers of gambling addiction treatment centers 
its a bit of a twist to get voters to approve gambling

a streak of bad luck has montana lottery 
officials moaning that they cant give money away 
lottery workers have been frustrated for the past 18 months by 
the failure of any contestant in the weekly big spin game to hit the 
jackpot 
unfortunately the wheel of fortune has run against the 
lottery says chuck brooke the lottery director we havent had 
any big winners and thats what the lottery needs 
in addition to making a lucky contestant 1 million richer a 
jackpot hit might help reverse a slump in ticket sales which fell 
50 percent in the lotterys second year 
the one thing that drives ticket sales is the publicity that 
goes to the winners brooke says 
the last jackpot winner was keith dunn of billings who won 
950000 on feb 17 1988 since then 219 contestants have spun the 
big spin wheel without hitting the jackpot the wheel has 100 slots 
representing various payouts 
entries for the big spin also have slumped only about 35000 
people enter the drawing each week now by sending in losing 
instantwinner tickets compared to about 120000 a week during the 
games opening months two years ago lottery spokesman ron duda says 
in an effort to spread more wealth lottery officials altered the 
wheel last september they upped the lowest prize from 1000 to 
3000 added new 50000 and 100000 slots and created two 
jackpot slots that pay 1 million each 
the old format had one jackpot slot that began at 250000 and 
increased 25000 each time a contestant failed to hit it there 
were four winners under the old system 
but even with the increased odds of 50to1 for a jackpot winner 
none has materialized yet the extended streak of bad luck for an 
office whose phone number is 442luck has become a running joke at 
lottery headquarters 
wed love to have some milliondollar hits brooke says 
that money is sitting there waiting to be won theres nothing 
else we can do with it 
by law at least 45 percent of lottery revenue must be paid out 
in prizes the money sits in a state account earns no interest for 
the lottery and cannot be spent on anything but prizes 
to make sure the wheel is operating properly lottery officials 
spin it six times before and six times after the spins by the three 
weekly contestants the wheel also must be spun 100 times after it 
is moved to ensure its random nature 
duda says the jackpot slots have been hit several times during 
the warmup spins in one instance it came up twice in a row 
the lotterys instantwinner ticket sales fell to about 12 
million in the year ending june 30 down from 23 million during the 
games first year ticket sales of more than 1 million in may ended 
a sevenmonth decline and brooke said he hopes sales will hit 18 
million during the current fiscal year

the government is investigating additional top cuban 
officials named by a drug trafficker whose revelations led to the 
execution of four highranking members of fidel castros government 
the attorney for smuggler reinaldo ruiz said ruiz had implicated 
castro and his brother raul the defense minister in cocaine 
trafficking 
the case of ruiz sentenced monday to 17 years in prison also 
brought testimony that former haitian military leader lt gen henri 
namphy supported drug smugglers assistant us attorney thomas 
mulvihill said 
ruiz 51 indicted on 27 drug counts in february 1988 has 
cooperated fully with the government since his arrest last year 
mulvihill said 
ruiz had faced a life sentence on the charges but his sentence 
could be reduced even further if he continues to tesfify said us 
district judge thomas c scott ruiz must also pay a 11 million 
fine 
mulvihill said ruiz had given the names of four or five more 
smuggling groups headed by leading cuban officials and said those 
cases were under investigation 
ruizs attorney fred schwartz said his client told the 
government that both raul and fidel castro are involved in drug 
trafficking but mulvihill refused to confirm the two cuban 
leaders were targets of the continuing probe 
the prosecutor acknowledged however that ruizs information 
has been pretty accurate so far 
ruiz was present at a cuban air base with raul castros 
bodgyguards when at one point cocaine spilled out of the cigar boxes 
ruiz used to disguise his cargo according to the prosecutor and 
defense attorney 
the bodyguards spurned the cocaine but said they would like any 
marijuana ruiz had available the prosecutor said 
in addition a secretly made videotape of a convicted member of 
ruizs gang elias carvil showed him telling drug pilots before his 
arrest that they had no reason to fear turmoil in haiti 
its ok to go in there because namphy is narcotics trafficking 
too all you have to do is pay the price the prosecutor 
recounted carvil as saying namphy was ousted from power in 
september 1988 
ruiz took the stand briefly saying he wanted to make up for the 
damage he had done through his drug smuggling 
i am willing to testify cooperate to go to any kind of extent 
even on my own expense ruiz told the judge 
ruiz pleaded guilty in march to heading a cocainesmuggling ring 
that shipped at least 1000 pounds of cocaine into the united state 
via a cuban air force base and other points his son ruben ruiz 
and girlfriend ligia cruz also pleaded guilty and are awaiting 
sentencing 
ruiz a cuban exile had set up a smuggling ring that handled 
everything from getting cubans out of their homeland to bringing 
puerto rican lottery tickets to the united states 
he eventually made contact with a cousin in the cuban military 
who introduced him to many of the officials who since have been 
arrested or executed in their country 
fidel castro has acknowledged that revelations from the case 
which he said matched information from colombian sources prompted 
the investigation that led to the june arrest and execution of four 
top cuban officials including the decorated war hero maj gen 
arnaldo ochoa sanchez

the bush administration should shift its 
billiondollar effort to curtail marijuana use toward education 
because the current interdiction strategy isnt working says a 
harvard university researcher 
the funds poured into stemming the flow of marijuana in the 
united states could easily be cut in half because its pretty 
clear theres nothing the federal government can do with its 
enforcement efforts to reduce the abuse researcher mark ar 
kleiman said in an interview monday 
kleiman a lecturer at harvards john f kennedy school of 
government released a new study that urges federal officials to 
move away from a broad war on drugs and instead focus on 
practical solutions to the problem 
the annual federal marijuana enforcement budget nearly doubled 
between 1982 and 1988 growing from 526 million in 1988 dollars to 
968 million but the funding has curtailed neither availability nor 
abuse of the drug kleiman said 
he contends the war on drugs mentality prevalent in 
washington since the early 1980s is an emotional rather than 
practical appeal that has backfired in several ways 
interdiction efforts on the international level have restricted 
the flow of drugs into this country but resulted in encouraging a 
wider domestic marijuana industry that produces an even more potent 
form of the drug 
some consumers are literally growing it at home and domestic 
production has gone from possibly 10 percent of the us marijuana 
market to probably a third today by weight the researcher said 
kleiman said he based his domestic production figure on federal 
drug enforcement reports the national narcotics intelligence 
consumers committee placed the 1988 figure at about 25 percent 
the current marijuana enforcement strategy has also encouraged 
violence by giving criminal organizations an edge in the trade 
kleiman said 
the more enforcement there is the better violence and 
corruption pay he wrote the natural effect of ordinary drug 
enforcement is to drive out the weakest drug dealers and increase 
the profit of the rest 
larry cirignano a spokesman for national drug policy coordinator 
william bennett declined to comment on kleimans study but said a 
new drug strategy scheduled for unveiling this fall would target 
not just drug dealers but users 
instead of pouring funding into enforcement programs kleiman 
said the money should be directed toward educational programs that 
would make marijuana use less acceptable 
the best way to reduce adolescent drug abuse is to teach them 
the skill of gracefully declining the offer of something they dont 
want to do he said

chancellor helmut kohl fired the 
manager of his conservative christian democratic union in an 
apparent bid to bolster the sliding fortunes of the party before the 
national election 
heiner geissler told reporters at a news conference late monday 
that kohl told him he would not be renominated at the partys 
national conference which begins sept 10 in bremen 
i regret this said geissler who has been party general 
secretary for 12 years i think it sends the wrong political 
signal 
kohl planned a news conference today to discuss party issues as 
well as the governments plans for responding to a flood of refugees 
from east germany 
like kohls reorganization of his 19member cabinet in april the 
party shakeup appears aimed at winning back voters who have been 
defecting to other parties the past two years 
the christian democrats fared poorly in the european parliament 
elections in june and it lost control of the berlin and frankfurt 
city governments in other elections this year 
although west germanys economic performance has continued 
strong voters have become increasingly disenchanted with the bonn 
governments policies toward sharing of nato defense burdens and the 
steady stream of refugees and asylum seekers entering the country 
that dissatisfaction has sent many traditional christian democrat 
voters to the political fringes boosting support for both the 
ultrarightist republicans and leftist parties like the greens 
public opinion polls conducted over the past few months have 
repeatedly shown the christian democrats running a few points behind 
the leftleaning social democrats in popularity 
the liberal free democratic party currently aligned to kohls 
conservativeled coalition has also hinted recently that it may 
switch allegiances before the next national elections in december 
1990 if the party continues its slide at the polls

a top iranian official was quoted today as 
saying iran and britain could restore diplomatic ties that were 
severed during the salman rushdie dispute if london shows respect 
for islamic values the state news agency reported 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
quoted mahmoud vaezi deputy foreign minister for america and 
europe as saying relations with britain can be restored even 
today 
but this must be conditional on the british government being 
able to convince members of the majlis parliament that its 
intentions are genuinely motivated and it will be willing to respect 
islamic principles and values he said in an interview with the 
governmentsupervised tehran times 
the majlis voted in march to sever ties with britian after the 
government refused to denounce the british novelist because of his 
novel the satanic verses 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini claiming rushdie had 
blashphemed islam sentenced him to death and the indianborn author 
went into hiding with british police protection 
while recognizing the book might offend some people the british 
government said rushdie was excercising his right of free speech 
fourteen western nations withdrew their ambassadors temporarily 
from tehran because of the death sentence 
vaezi said the upsanddowns in relations with the west are 
caused by its lack of concern for islamic values the foundation of 
the islamic republic 
he said ties with london could have remained strong were it not 
for the unpardonable mistake of supporting salman rushdie 
vaezi meanwhile linked the case of jailed briton roger cooper a 
longtime resident of iran imprisoned on spying charges to that of 
kourosh fouladi an iranian he said was serving an unjust 10year 
sentence in britain 
fouladi a former doorman at the iranian embassy in london was 
arrested in 1980 following a bungled car bombing attack in london 
the only survivor of a gang of three bombers who blew themselves 
up fouladi was jailed for 10 years in 1982 
cooper is charged with spying during the iraniraq war and only 
the judiciary of the islamic republic of iran can decide on his case 
based on the charges filed against him vaezi said

vice president dan quayle said the united states 
has an obligation to continue humanitarian aid to the contras until 
democratic conditions exist in nicaragua 
quayle said monday the aid should continue despite a plan 
approved by central american presidents to dismantle the contras by 
dec 5 
the bottom line is that they should not be forced to go back to 
nicaragua until it is safe for them to do so and until conditions 
have been established for their normal reintegration into nicaraguan 
society the vice president said 
quayles comments in a speech before the annual veterans of 
foreign wars convention represented an elaboration of the 
administrations position that the central american presidents plan 
was premature 
the contras backed by the united states since 1981 have been 
fighting to oust nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and are 
now mostly camped along the honduran border with nicarague 
the vice president said it is indisputable that safe and 
democratic conditions do not exist in nicaragua today and until 
they do exist it will remain a moral obligation of the united 
states to continue its humanitarian assistance to those people 
members of congress from both parties have said that the dec 5 
demobilization deadline could set the stage for a confrontation 
between the administration and congress because the humanitarian aid 
program set up for the contras is subject to congressional review 
and could be halted on nov 30 
quayle aligned himself with conservatives who maintain that the 
contras should remain intact as a fighting force until after the 
leftist sandinista government holds elections on feb 25 1990 
we believe that maintenance of the resistance as a cohesive 
force provides a unique incentive to the sandinistas to live up to 
their pledge to allow free elections he said 
the plan signed by the presidents of nicaragua el salvador 
honduras costa rica and guatemala does not mention the mechanics 
for disarming the rebels it calls for an international commission 
to aid the contras in resettling in their homeland or a third 
country honduras has said the rebels must leave their base camps 
near the nicaraguan border 
quayle challenged the sandinistas to guarantee the integrity 
of the february election by allowing for a nongovernment television 
station permitting voting by exiles and lifting all restrictions on 
foreign election observers 
the vice president who visited several central american 
countries in june also called on nicaragua cuba and the soviet 
union to stop arming leftist guerrillas in el salvador 
quayle was given a polite but restrained reception by the 
veterans some of whom had complained about his appearance because 
of the controversy during last years campaign over his national 
guard service the speech was interrupted only twice by applause 
though most of the delegates rose to applaud when the speech was 
over 
quayle interrupted his vacation and flew to las vegas from the 
ranch of sen malcom wallop of wyoming he was to resume his 
vacation at a family compound on the colorado river in arizona

tensions remained after the settlement of a telephone strike in 
california and nevada while vandalism and demonstrations mounted in 
a strike in the northeast 
elsewhere there was hope the pacific telesis agreement would 
give new impetus to resolve strikes in the midwest and midatlantic 
states 
about 42000 strikers returned to work monday at san 
franciscobased pacific telesis after negotiators reached agreement 
with the communications workers of america over the weekend on a 
pact that will raise salaries by 11 percent over three years the 
agreement is scheduled for a ratification vote by sept 22 
but hard feelings remained among those who went on strike and 
those who stayed on the job 
theyre not talking to us said one directory assistance 
operator who had crossed the picket lines because he couldnt afford 
to strike im a very mildmannered person i just ignore them 
more vandalism was reported in the strike against nynex which 
serves new york and the northeast a judge in albany ny issued a 
temporary injunction ordering strikers not to engage in mass 
picketing or interfere with operations at new york telephone a 
nynex subsidiary 
there were at least 13 incidents of vandalism to new york 
telephone lines last weekend causing phone service outages for more 
than 4000 customers company spokesman peter muller said 
in indianapolis cwa spokesman l keith dooley said he thought 
the pacific telesis contract could serve as a guide for negotiations 
between the union and ameritech which serves five midwestern states 
both cwa and ameritech officials said they were willing to go 
back to the bargaining table although neither side expressed a 
willingness to initiate new talks 
there also were hopeful signs in philadelphia where negotiations 
continued between workers and management at bell atlantic which 
covers the midatlantic states and washington dc 
mary ohara an adminstrative assistant for the cwa said union 
officials have still got hope of resolving the issues with bell 
atlantic by midnight tuesday both sides agreed to the deadline 
the three continuing strikes involve more than 150000 workers 
in albany judge lawrence kahn issued a restraining order that 
instructs the cwa to have no more than 10 pickets at an entrance to 
a new york telephone building in addition pickets must remain at 
least 15 feet away from company vehicles and employees and cannot 
vandalize company equipment he said 
but striking union members said they had been advised by their 
attorneys that kahn had no jurisdiction over the matter and that 
they could carry on with their picketing as usual 
essentially it means nothing said william sullivan 
president of local 1126 in utica ny 
in providence ri a man was arrested for disorderly conduct in 
a demonstration outside a nynex building as police escorted about 
200 management employees to their jobs

the federal aviation administration has ordered 
airlines to tighten fire safety measures on many aircraft after 
studying the 1987 crash of a south africa airways boeing 747 that 
caught fire in the air 
in a directive made public on monday the faa said the 
operational and equipment changes were ordered to avoid an 
uncontrolled cargo fire that could cause systems and structural 
damage leading to the loss of the airplane 
the plane models affected by the aug 10 directive include 
certain boeing 707s 727s 737s 747s and 757s and mcdonnell 
douglas dc8s dc9s including md80s and dc10s approximately 
40 airplanes currently operated by us carriers are affected the 
faa said 
the faa also said there are about 278 boeing planes and 124 
mcdonnell douglas planes affected worldwide only us carriers are 
required to follow faa rules although foreign carriers usually do 
the aircraft affected by the faa ruling are equipped with class b 
cargo compartments located on the main deck which also carries 
passengers 
the planes are designed so that the same area of the aircraft can 
be used for passengers cargo or both said dick meyer an faa 
spokesman in seattle 
on these planes crew members are responsible for walking back to 
the cargo compartment and extinguishing any fires kirotv in 
seattle reported the south africa airways jet that crashed into the 
indian ocean on november 28 1987 killing 159 people had a class b 
cargo compartment 
although no formal findings have been issued by the foreign 
authority having jurisdiction over the accident investigation there 
is firm evidence that an inflight fire occurred in a class b cargo 
compartment which contributed to the loss of the airplane the 
faa said 
the faa presented two options to improve fire safety aboard the 
aircraft the planes can be refitted with class c cargo compartments 
which would be located on a different deck from passengers 
selfcontained and better equipped to handle and control a fire the 
faa noted that there are no known cases of aircraft lost due to fire 
in class c cargo compartments 
a second option would require design changes including 
installation of smoke or fire detection and fire extinguishing 
systems and having aboard an individual trained to fight cargo 
fires the directive said 
the agency estimated that retooling to class c cargo departments 
could take three years after the ruling goes into effect sept 25 
the alternative design changes could be accomplished in one year 
the cost of converting a class b cargo compartment to class c 
would be approximately 25 million for each wide body airplane and 
about 1 million for a standard body the faa estimated the costs 
of the alternative design changes were estimated at 800000 for 
each standard body plane and 22 million for each wide body 
the ruling goes into effect sept 25

a us representative today called for an 
international insurance policy under which many hong kong 
residents wary about chinese rule that begins in 1997 could quickly 
escape 
stephen j solarz the new york democrat who is chairman of the 
house subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said such a 
multilateral program involving the united states britain canada 
and other countries would help restore confidence among hong kong 
people 
the 57 million people of this british colony have long been 
concerned about what will happen to hong kong when it reverts to 
communist china in eight years fears over the future increased 
after the chinese military quashed the prodemocracy movement in 
beijing in june 
solarz said he envisioned a program under which hong kong people 
could move permanently to a foreign country without first meeting 
existing residency requirements he said perhaps several hundred 
thousand local people could meet qualifying criteria set by the host 
countries for the program 
hong kong residents who qualify for the program would have the 
confidence to remain here where i think most of them would like to 
stay knowing that if worse came to worse they would have the 
opportunity to relocate elsewhere solarz told a news conference 
he said such a program might give the authorities in beijing an 
even greater incentive to conduct themselves in a way that is 
sensitive to the concerns of the people in hong kong knowing 
that if they botch it all up when they arrive in 1997 a lot of the 
people who make hong kong go would no longer be around 
solarz said he would discuss the issue which he described as a 
kind of multilateral immigration insurance policy with the bush 
administration when he returns to washington and that he might hold 
hearings he said the support of britain would be crucial 
london has refused to grant most hong kong residents the right to 
live in britain but has spoken of an international relief effort if 
the situation deteriorates in the territory 
tens of thousands of hong kong residents have besieged local 
consulates in bids to emigrate before the chinese take over 
solarz also said the manner in which hong kong deals with its 
rapidly expanding population of vietnamese boat people will help 
determine the willingness of the international community to assist 
hong kong people 
more than 50000 vietnamese who fled their communist homeland by 
boat for this colony are now languishing in crowded hong kong camps 
hong kong continues to offer temporary refuge to all arriving 
vietnamese despite calls by many residents to scrap the policy the 
government has started a screening policy however under which 
vietnamese who cannot prove they fled persecution will be forcibly 
sent back to their homeland once hanoi agrees 
but solarz said it cannot be in the interest of hong kong if 
people are en masse forced to return to vietnam he suggested boat 
people who are determined not eligible for refugee status be given 
several months to volunteer to return home

about 370 people including dozens 
of foreigners were taken into custody during protests marking the 
21st anniversary of the invasion of czechoslovakia a newspaper 
reported today 
authorities blamed foreign media and provocateurs for 
mondays demonstrations for more freedom and the withdrawal of 
soviet troops who rolled in to crush communist reform on aug 21 
1968 
at least three protests were dispersed by batonwielding police 
and several people were beaten however the communist party daily 
rude pravo reported that there were no injuries 
the daily quoted an interior ministry official josef dvorak as 
saying 320 czechoslovak citizens were detained as well as 50 
foreigners it did not say where they were from officials earlier 
declined to give any specific figures or to elaborate 
czechoslovak activists said late monday at least four hungarians 
were among those arrested a polish journalist said he was told by 
polish diplomats that several poles were also detained 
the nations entrenched leaders installed by moscow after 1968 
but now under mounting pressure to introduce reform blamed what the 
government news agency ctk called foreign provocateurs from 
italy hungary and poland for the protest and said they would be 
punished under valid czechoslovak laws 
rude pravo reiterated those accusations and also accused western 
news agencies and other media of inciting protest by reporting plans 
for mass demonstrations before they happened 
the busloads of riot police sent in to quell the protests were 
seen leaving the capital today 
the demonstrations marked the invasion led by the soviets and 
joined by all warsaw pact nations except romania which ended the 
prague spring reforms begun by former communist party leader 
alexander dubcek 
in the protests at least 4000 people marched round the city for 
hours chanting calls for freedom and the withdrawal of soviet troops 
and shouting to police let our brothers go each time arrests 
were made by hundreds of helmeted riot police 
the show of force contrasted with reforms under way in poland 
hungary and the soviet union which have encouraged many 
czechoslovaks to demand similar changes 
hungarian government television on monday broadcast interviews 
with former leaders who introduced the reforms of prague spring 
interspersed with footage of burning tanks and of other emotional 
memories of the invasion 
other clips during the 30minute broadcast showed clashes between 
czechoslovak riot police and protesters 
in a previously unshown interview former deputy premier ota sik 
who fled to switzerland after the invasion said the present 
czechoslovak leadership is dancing on a thin rope it is 
really hoping that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is going 
to fall and that it can survive that long 
the hungarian communist party and government each strongly 
disassociated themselves last week from the 1968 invasion with 
premier miklos nemeth saying sunday that his government condemns 
hungarys participation in the invasion 
the polish parliament stung czechoslovak leaders with a strongly 
worded resolution last week condemning the invasion as a violation 
of international law 
the soviet union the traditional role model for czechoslovakias 
communists was more cautious foreign ministry spokesman yuri a 
gremitskykh made clear monday however that the 1968 invasion could 
be seen only in the context of the times 
east germany which has also resisted reforms was the only one 
of czechoslovakias warsaw pact allies to come out with a clear 
statement supporting the invasion as a necessary move to thwart 
counterrevolution in czechoslovakia

troops today fatally shot a palestinian woman in

found the body of a youth shot in the chest arab reports said 
a 14yearold palestinian girl also died today of wounds suffered 
in a clash with soldiers last week hospital officials said her

youth was found dead from a chest wound at the west banks alamari 
refugee camp near ramallah

killing during security forces operations they do not exclude

opalocka fla ap us coast guard commandant adm paul yost 
has agreed to support a proposed tenmile tankerfree zone off 
floridas coast but the plan quickly drew criticism from the oil 
industry 
gov bob martinez won yosts backing for his plan to shift major 
shipping lanes to 10 nautical miles from the coastal reefs after the 
two officials flew down the coast to the florida keys on monday 
all we can do to prevent a catastrophe in florida needs to be 
done martinez said establishing a tankerfree zone would 
create a buffer between floridas coast and tanker traffic which 
would provide additional response time to deal with any oil spills 
yost said the coast guard would seek federal and international 
backing for the plan and agreed to study coast guard participation 
in a major oilspill drill with florida authorities within the next 
12 months 
but ken leonard transportation director for the american 
petroleum institute said the plan has significant problems that 
need to be worked out and would require lengthy international 
negotiations 
leonard also said the proposal could make shipping more dangerous 
by forcing southbound tankers into the lane normally used by 
northbound tankers 
shipping lanes currently pass as close as two miles from shore at 
some points along floridas coast though both martinez and yost 
noted that most fully laden tankers heading north normally take 
advantage of strong gulf stream currents farther out to sea 
more than 5000 ships pass in and out of the gulf of mexico 
through the florida straits each year carrying tens of billions 
of gallons of petroleum products the governors office said 
vessels entering florida ports carry an estimated 12 billion 
gallons of petroleum products each year most of it goes to port 
everglades near fort lauderdale the nations second largest port 
for oiltanker traffic 
while the united states and many other nations support a 12mile 
international limit yost said international support for the 
proposed change would require lobbying at the international maritime 
organization which oversees shipping worldwide 
yost cautioned that it could take years to get other nations to 
agree to the move and to overcome expected opposition from the 
shipping industry 
martinez agreed 
this is not something that can be changed overnight the 
governor said ships will have to slow their speed travel farther 
and use more fuel so we expect that will figure in the industry 
view 
yost said he found the proposal especially important since the 
tanker exxon valdez hit a reef in alaska and spilled about 11 
million gallons of crude into the pristine waters of prince william 
sound in march

kandu the giant killer whale that gave birth 
before thousands of people last fall was killed when she collided 
with another killer whale during a performance at sea world park 
officials said 
kandu who weighed about 6000 pounds and corky who weighs 
about 8000 pounds were starting their 4 pm show in the 
performing tank at shamu stadium when the accident occurred sea 
world officials said 
the show was canceled and several thousand visitors who witnessed 
the bloody accident were escorted out of the stadium park officials 
said its uncertain when the popular whale shows would resume 
its very obvious to you as it is to us that kandu is 
bleeding the announcer at shamu stadium told the audience 
were not really sure what happened we want to see if we can 
get the whales calmed down 
park veterinarians and animalcare staff were preparing to 
perform an autopsy on kandu who gave birth to baby shamu in the 
same stadium last september 
corky who apparently was not injured completed part of a 
shortened performance before the audience was led away witnesses 
said 
the two adult whales were coming into the show pen when it 
seemed like they collided said jim barnes who was at the show 
while on vacation from stansbury park utah 
they got the mother whale into about six inches of water the 
baby was laying right there next to her and the blood was really 
bad he said 
gary gregg told kfmbtv he saw the accident from a high seat in 
the back of the stadium 
the two large whales apparently collided at a high rate of 
speed about 35 to 40 mph he said 
i did see a tail section come out of the water and the whales 
did a complete circle then when the mother came out she spewed a 
large amount of blood from her blowhole he said 
corky is about 25 years old and 20 feet long kandu was about 14 
years old and measured 17 feet said a sea world spokeswoman who 
asked that her name not be used

juan luis merced takes his message 
about aids to park benches gay bars soup kitchens and crack houses 
he goes door to door in mostly hispanic neighborhoods handing out 
fliers about where to go for information and testing for el sida 
aids in spanish 
as the aids virus seeps into the nations smaller cities there 
is a growing need for people to take aids education to those who 
need it most intravenous drug users minorities the homeless the 
poor 
those people are the ones who are missed through the more 
traditional modes of health education says imani thompson a 
health education specialist for the national centers for disease 
control in altanta it makes sense that people in smaller 
communities are trying to figure out methods to deal with this 
because this problem is everywhere 
the tests here are conducted at the heartside clinic which began 
the aids program in may with state funding 
the clinic is located in a tiny storefront in the heart of the 
citys skid row which attracts a large percentage of the citys 
transient population drug and substance abusers and prostitutes 
of those coming to the clinic about 80 percent are considered at 
high risk of contracting aids of about 80 tests conducted since 
may 14 people have tested positive 
outside gods kitchen the citys biggest soup kitchen merced 
greets many of the dozens of men and women who form a line halfway 
down the block for a free meal 
i try to be a friend first and get their trust says the 
29yearold merced they know me as the aids man and thats ok 
merced a native of puerto rico has been successful in getting 
indigent members of the citys hispanic community into the clinic 
for free testing 
weve been flooded since we got someone who can break the 
language barrier says project director pat oconnor thats not 
easy to find in this part of the country 
for those who test positive for the hiv virus counselors 
construct a life plan arranging for medical care housing and 
food 
this is such a disenfranchised group of people you cant tell 
them that theyll have to go to one place to fill out a form go to 
another halfway across town to get their medical care and another to 
get food the next time youll see them theyll be in the 
emergency room oconnor says 
in the beginning some people questioned whether such a program 
was needed in this conservative western michigan city of 180000 
said dr david baumgartner medical director of the program 
there was and continues to be a tremendous amount of denial in 
this community that hiv is a problem baumgartner said but its 
like a ball rolling downhill gaining momentum as word gets out we 
keep seeing more and more people coming in 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
as of july 31 1989 the federal centers for disease control in 
atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 102621 cases of aids in 
the united states with 59391 deaths 
cdc estimates that 1 million to 15 million americans have 
already been infected with the aids virus and of that total 20 to 
30 percent will develop aids by the end of 1991

lindy chamberlain the mother in 
australias dingobaby case says she is owed millions of dollars in 
compensation promised nearly a year after she was found innocent of 
charges she killed her infant daughter 
mrs chamberlain who claims her 6weekold daughter was snatched 
by a dingo a native australian wild dog while on a camping trip in 
the outback says the notoriety has left her broke and prevented her 
family from living a normal life 
mrs chamberlain 41 who in the past has resented her trial by 
media called a news conference with selected journalists monday to 
generate publicity to force the northern territory government which 
prosecuted her and later pardoned her to pay compensation for the 
3 years she spent in jail 
her ordeal regarded as one of the miscarriages of justice in 
australian legal history and her fight for compensation have been 
frontpage stories for years in australian newspapers 
but despite eight bestsellers about the case mrs chamberlain 
claimed she had not received much money she also said money she 
received from the 1988 movie a cry in the dark in which meryl 
streep played her role covered little more than her expenses 
husband michael 45 a former pastor with the seventh day 
adventist church said he eked out a living chopping firewood and 
selling it for 26 a trailer load mrs chamberlain said she could 
not afford to buy new shoes for her three schoolage children 
people think a couple so famous should be rich she said 
our anonymity has been blasted we cant live a normal life you 
cant plan for the future because you dont know what that future 
is 
the familys saga has captivated the australian public since 
1980 when mrs chamberlain claimed a dingo killed her daughter 
azaria in the outback 
mrs chamberlain was prosecuted for murder by the northern 
territory government but was released following the discovery of 
vital new evidence while a royal commission the highest form of 
investigation available reviewed the case 
mrs chamberlain was finally pardoned last november the 
chamberlains have refused to reveal the amount of compensation they 
were promised but a figure leaked to the media by the northern 
territory government put it at around 3 million 
officials for the northern territory government could not be 
reached for comment today or monday 
maybe an apology is a little hard to swallow and lets face it 
compensation is an apology mrs chamberlain said 
the couple said they owe about 1 million in legal costs mostly 
to the seventh day adventist church which supported them through 
their court battles

a west german and a relative of the former king of 
afghanistan have been charged with plotting to ship a computer to 
the soviet union in violation of us export restrictions 
egbert parthesuis 46 and abdul aziz ahmad 40 were ordered 
held without bail following their arrest monday ahmad was 
identified in court papers as a nephew of mohammad zahir shah 
deposed as king of afghanistan in a 1973 coup 
the pair were scheduled to appear before us magistrate morton 
sitver for a bail hearing thursday 
the customs service said its undercover agents set up an export 
company as part of an eightmonth investigation to crack a ring 
allegedly intending to ship sophisticated military dataprocessing 
equipment to soviet bloc nations 
parthesuis ahmad and hady azimi believed to be ahmads cousin 
living in west germany conspired to purchase and export a digital 
equipment vax 8820 computer customs spokesman charles conroy said 
government regulations bar the export of that type of computer to 
sovietbloc nations officials said 
agents allowed parthesuis and ahmad to buy a relatively 
unsophisticated ibm computer with military applications and export 
it to west germany customs agent thomas mcdermott said 
at the time of that 28000 purchase the two allegedly put down 
a deposit on the vax 882 he said 
then last thursday they came forward with the balance of the 
596000 mcdermott said 
parthesuis allegedly also gave agents a list of other computers 
antennas and related equipment he intended to buy officials said 
the equipment was to be flown to london then trucked to budapest 
hungary for a flight to moscow or leningrad they added 
customs officials are working with west german police in an 
attempt to arrest azimi officials said 
parthesuis was in the united states on a visitors visa and 
ahmad was a resident alien living in alexandria va officials said 
parthesuis and ahmad were charged in us district court with 
violating the 4yearold arms export control act as well as with 
conspiracy and money laundering if convicted on all counts they 
could each receive up to 35 years in prison and a 25 million fine

the bodies of 18 young sinhalese men 
were found in a village northeast of the capital at the spot where 
sinhalese radicals ambushed an army convoy sources said today 
also today military officials said sinhalese radicals killed at 
least 20 relatives of police and army officers and indian officials 
said their forces killed five tamil rebels 
the 18 bodies all with gunshot wounds were found in a roadside 
crater at mahawehera 85 miles from colombo according to the 
sources who spoke on condition they were not identified further 
the crater was formed when sinhalese radicals detonated 
explosives under a passing sri lankan army patrol sunday killing at 
least five soldiers and a civilian driver 
the sources said the 18 were suspected radicals who were killed 
in revenge for sundays attack government officials denied 
knowledge of any retaliatory violence in mahawehera however in the 
past senior government officials said privately that members of the 
security forces have committed excesses in efforts to halt the 
radicals campaign of assassination and terror 
sinhalese radicals oppose the sinhalesedominated governments 
agreement to grant limited autonomy to tamils in the north and east 
most tamils are hindu and say they are discriminated against by the 
buddhist sinhalese majority 
the killings today and monday of 20 family members of officers 
came after radicals threatened to kill the relatives of officers who 
refused to resign by last sunday said military officials who 
cannot be identified under briefing rules 
in colombo radicals hurled a bomb into a police jeep in the 
northern suburb of maradana they said six policemen were injured 
at least 4000 people have been killed since ultranationalist 
sinhalese launched an antigovernment campaign in july 1987 when 
the government agreed to a peace plan with the tamils the radicals 
say a peace plan aimed at ending the rebellion gave too many 
concessions to the tamils 
they also say the deployment of indian soldiers in the 
tamildominated north and east to enforce the plan compromises sri 
lankas sovereignity 
a statement from the indian high commission or embassy said its 
soldiers monday killed five tamil rebels belonging to a group that 
rejected the 1987 plan india sponsored the plan because of the 
sympathies of its own 60 million tamils for their sri lankan 
brethren but got bogged down in fighting rebels who renounced it 
at least 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
been killed since tamils launched their separatist war in 1983 
complaining of discrimination by the sinhalese majority 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
sinhalese make up 75 percent

clashes raged overnight between syrian and 
christian forces in beirut the central mountains and north lebanon 
despite a peace offer by christian army commander gen michel aoun 
police said today 
three people were killed and 47 were wounded in the dusktodawn 
clashes with howitzers multibarreled rocket launchers mortars 
tank cannons and machine guns the police said 
by police count 788 people have been killed and 2187 wounded 
since march 8 when the current round of violence broke out pitting 
aouns 20000 mainly christian troops against 40000 syrian soldiers 
and allied local forces 
the operations room of syrianbacked leftist factions said in 
a statement that its gunners opened fire on six ships in lebanese 
territorial waters and prevented them from docking at christian 
ports 
the command claimed its gunners scored direct hits on the lead 
ship forcing the whole group to sail away 
a spokesman for aouns command speaking on condition of 
anonymity described the claims as baseless 
the christian enclave northeast of beirut has been under siege by 
syrian and allied forces for more than five months with the declared 
objective of preventing aoun from receiving iraqisupplied war 
material by sea 
the aoun spokesman also said syria had provided its leftist and 
moslem allies with 130mm sovietdesigned howitzer guns capable of 
hitting targets within a 15mile range 
but syrias allies do not have the computerized radar equipment 
needed to detect mobile maritime targets determine their speed and 
calculate the target data the spokesman said 
moslem security sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the syrians also were sending additional tanks howitzers and 
mortars to the 22000strong moslem army units of maj gen sami 
khatib as well as druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive 
socialist party militia 
one source said the syrians have been flooding their allies 
with weapons and ammunition for more than a week now it seems they 
are preparing them for a major battle with aoun 
john mccarthy the us ambassador to lebanon told reporters 
after a 45minute meeting with aoun that theres obviously no 
military solution to the problem for lebanon 
mccarthy said the purpose of his meeting with aoun was to 
emphasize that the military confrontation is not taking us 
anywhere he also said washington favors a ceasefire 
also today acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem who 
heads the syrianbacked cabinet vying for power with aouns refuted 
the maronite generals offer monday for negotiations 
it is a minefield any response to it is highly unlikely 
hoss said in a statement broadcast by voice of the people radio 
syria did not comment on the offer and jumblatt described it as 
a trick to allow aoun a breathing spell to rearm and marshall his 
forces 
aoun had declared a war of liberation against the syrian 
troops in lebanon charging the damascus government has betrayed its 
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league by supporting moslems 
against christians in the 14yearold civil war 
two civilians were wounded by israeli shelling of villages in 
southeastern lebanon known to be strongholds for proiranian shiite 
moslem extremists police reported today 
they said at least 10 houses were damaged in overnight 
bombardment that hit the villages of yohmor sohmor zillaya kilia 
ein eltineh and maydoun outside the zone israeli troops and allied 
militiamen control in south lebanon 
in paris meanwhile defense ministry sources said a antisubmarine 
frigate and an oil supply ship are joining six other french naval 
ships off the lebanese coast 
the meuse left the french port of toulon early today maritime 
sources there said the jean de vienne left france over the weekend 
according to the defense ministry 
french officials have denied lebanese moslem allegations that 
france may intervene militarily and have said the flotilla could be 
used to evacuate some 7000 french passport holders from lebanon if 
the fighting worsens

united mine workers won a victory in court 
but were less successful in the field where they mounted a 
demonstration against a coal company that no longer exists 
circuit judge donald mcglothlin who has fined the union 75 
million for violating strike restrictions on monday dismissed 
contempt charges against umw vice president cecil roberts and other 
union leaders who took part in an outlawed sitdown demonstration 
against the pittston coal group inc 
this is your victory today roberts told cheering union 
members after the threehour trial you can feel you are balancing 
the scales of justice if the system treats us fairly were going to 
beat pittston 
the umw has been on strike against pittston since april in a 
dispute over wages and benefits the strike affects 1900 pittston 
miners in west virginia virginia and kentucky about 46000 fellow 
union members stayed off the job for about a month in wildcat 
sympathy strikes 
roberts and five other members of the unions international 
policymaking board along with 13 rankandfile members were 
arrested july 25 for sitting in a road to block the entrance to 
pittstons main coal preparation plant in russell county 
mcglothlin tossed out the contempt charges against the union 
officials after ruling that the prosecuting attorney failed to show 
that the union leaders were aware of a provision in his injunction 
that prohibited people from blocking coal truck traffic 
special prosecutor bob detrick argued that the ban on sitdown 
demonstrations which has led to more than 2000 arrests in the past 
four months was common knowledge 
meanwhile in huntington wva a few dozen umw workers joined 
by about a dozen members of the communications workers of america 
staged a demonstration outside the headquarters of the chafin coal 
co but found the company no longer existed 
after finding an empty building where the coal companys 
headquarters were once located they went to the only building in 
town named after a chafin but found the chafins were no longer 
affiliated with it 
they settled for a downtown bank where john chafin the companys 
former president is on the board of directors 
then it rained forcing the group to disband 
the mine workers wearing camouflage said the coal company 
disbanded and subleased its logan county mines as a way to get 
around using union labor 
theyve opened some new mines at the hollow but they havent 
called the laidoff fellows back to work said fred o hartman a 
roof bolter furloughed two years ago 
there was no indication that chafin was at the bank or even in 
huntington calls to his home telephone went unanswered a telephone 
at the home of john chafin jr a company vice president had been 
disconnected

beginning today turkey is requiring visas 
for ethnic turks from bulgaria until an immigration accord is 
negotiated with the warsaw pact country an official said 
the new requirement which opposition leaders attacked will 
allow ankara to exert more control over an exodus that has brought 
300000 bulgarian turks into turkey the past three months foreign 
ministry officials said 
turkey has been having trouble providing jobs and housing for the 
immigrants many are temporarily housed in school buildings closed 
for the summer 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency reporting from the edirne 
border province quoted sen dennis deconcini dariz as saying he 
had seen 10000 ethnic turks lined up in cars waiting to get into 
turkey 
an official at the kapikule border post on the turkishbulgarian 
border said he was told the visa requirement goes into effect today 
erdal inonu leader of the main opposition social democrat 
populist party said the foreign policy of turkey had been 
discredited by what he called a policy reversal 
but a foreign ministry statement said the government decision was 
prompted by bulgarias refusal to start talks toward an immigration 
agreement protecting the rights of ethnic turks coming to turkey 
the immigrants say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign 
that has forced them to change their moslem names to slavic ones 
they say they have also been fined and beaten for speaking turkish 
in public and for practicing islamic rites 
the foreign ministry said turkey is still determined to accept 
all bulgarias ethnic turks who want to come but within the 
framework of an immigration agreement keeping families united and 
allowing compensation for property left behind and for accumulated

the university of michigan said it would 
have suspended part of its policy on racial harassment even if a a 
civil rights group had not charged the policy violates 
constitutional free speech rights 
while we believe that the entire harassment policy can 
withstand legal scrutiny we also knew from the beginning that the 
policy would be refined and improved as we gained experience from 
its implementation elsa kircher cole the universitys general 
counsel said monday 
the policy which applies to all students enrolled at the ann 
arbor school prohibits harassment or discrimination based on race 
ethnicity religion sex sexual orientation creed national 
origin ancestry age marital status handicap or vietnamveteran 
status 
the american civil liberties union of michigan filed a federal 
lawsuit in may saying the policy violated constitutional guarantees 
of freedom of speech the case is pending 
the suspended provision prohibits behavior in academic settings 
that creates an intimidating hostile or demeaning environment for 
educational pursuits employment or participation in university 
sponsored extracurricular activities 
michigan will continue to enforce its antiharassment policy 
against behavior that victimizes an individual the university said 
in a written statement 
the aclu suit has probably focused our attention on certain 
aspects of the policy which would have been discussed during the 
continuing review process this fall but i have no doubt the review 
would have led to the same outcome cole said 
the policy on discrimination was adopted in april 1988 following 
a series of racial incidents on campus 
the aclu said in its suit that the policy was intended to 
create a chilling effect on the expression of certain ideas because 
of the content of those ideas and is too broad and vague

the government held no public celebration today on 
the 85th birthday of senior leader deng xiaoping but major 
newspapers carried one of his speeches rejecting mass democracy for 
china 
the papers devoted a halfpage to the full text of his 1957 
speech that said communist party members must be supervised by the 
party the masses and noncommunist parties if they are to do their 
jobs well 
if we refuse to accept supervision or ignore promoting 
democracy within the party and the nation we will inevitably be 
divorced from the masses and make big mistakes deng said in the 
speech 
however he went on to say that china must not implement big 
democracy which the papers referred to the largescale clash of 
public opinions and unrest that is found in westernstyle 
democracies 
a footnote to the speech said the term was first used by 
revolutionary leader mao tsetung in 1956 
we can do without such democracy only if we have small 
democracy deng said meaning the masses should have channels for 
expressing their opinions to the party 
party organization officials are in the middle of a major meeting 
to discuss strengthening the 47 millionmember party including 
better policing members who express opinions contrary to the party 
line 
todays papers quoted premier li peng as saying the meeting 
will play an important role in eliminating the erroneous effects 
of comrade zhao ziyang on party building zhao was ousted as party 
chief in june after a toplevel power struggle over how to handle 
the spring student democracy movement 
the new party chief jiang zemin was quoted as saying that the 
masses of the party workers had long expressed dissatisfaction with 
comrade zhao for his mistakes in trying to weaken the leadership of 
the party 
zhao has become chinas national scapegoat since his purge and 
nearly all of the nations problems have been blamed on him 
the papers did not mention dengs birthday and many people 
seemed unaware of the date by contrast even 13 years after his 
death the nation still notes the birthday of chairman mao tsetung 
on dec 26 with special essays in the newspapers 
is today dengs birthday said a cab driver were all 
waiting for him to die he doesnt have much longer 
deng whose health has declined gradually in recent years is now 
reported to be seriously ill with cancer he has not been seen in 
public since june 9 when he spoke to martial law troops in beijing 
the most recent photo of him printed in newspapers monday was 
taken more than seven weeks ago 
no sign of dengs birthday was seen anywhere in central beijing 
even along the main thoroughfare changan avenue which is always 
colorfully decorated with flags and banners on special occasions 
dengs birthday was not celebrated in past years but since the 
june 34 military crackdown there have been hints of a possible 
emerging personality cult 
the press has quoted him regularly and released several past 
essays by him a new volume of his collected writings has been 
issued a book of reminiscences about his early career has come out 
and a major movie has been made about his role in leading a 
communist uprising in 1929 the china art gallery now displays a 
bronze bust of him

lawyers for selfdescribed hotel queen leona 
helmsley ended their defense after calling an accountant who told 
the jury in the tax evasion case that the defendant and her husband 
overpaid 581000 in taxes in 198385 
the accountant gerald w padwe testified monday that the 
federal overpayment stemmed from underreporting the depreciation of 
property in helmsleycontrolled partnerships 
padwe was the last of four witnesses called by attorneys for mrs 
helmsley who is accused of evading 12 million in federal taxes in 
198385 by charging personal expenses to businesses 
lawyers for mrs helmsleys two codefendants frank turco and 
joseph licari also rested monday but without calling any witnesses 
turco and licari who were former top aides in the helmsley 
organization are charged with assisting mrs helmsley in the tax 
evasion scheme 
turco and mrs helmsley are also charged with conspiring to 
extort payoffs and merchandise from vendors doing business with 
helmsley companies 
the prosecution closed its case last tuesday after six weeks of 
testimony lawyers will present closing arguments wednesday 
on crossexamination by assistant us attorney james devita 
padwe acknowledged that his review was selective and that the 
helmsleys could have underpaid taxes in the following years 
devita also implied that the calculation method was part of a 
strategy to reduce the amount of taxes paid in the long run 
padwe acknowledged that there could be a tax advantage to 
spreading out the depreciation and said it would be clearly 
improper he said however that he did not know if the 
calculations were deliberate or by mistake 
devita had opposed the defense lawyers request to call padwe to 
the stand the prosecutor said the evidence was irrelevant and could 
confuse the jury

orders for big ticket durable goods fell 
19 percent in july the fourth decline this year the government 
said today in a report that showed manufacturing continuing to 
struggle despite recent interest rate declines 
the commerce department said demand for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1229 billion last month the lowest level since october 1988 
durable goods one of the most interest ratesensitive sectors of 
the economy because consumers often borrow to buy them also had 
declined in january february and may 
the latest drop came despite moves by the federal reserve board 
since early june to nudge interest rates lower earlier the central 
bank had been raising rates to dampen economic vigor and 
inflationary pressure 
however last months bad news was somewhat offset by a sharply 
revised increase of 14 percent in durablegoods orders in june 
previously reported at up only 04 percent 
excluding the defense category which swings widely from month to 
month orders fell 09 percent in july after an 03 percent gain a 
month earlier 
military orders plunged 147 percent to 76 billion in july 
following a 174 percent rise in june 
the other major decline came in nonelectrical machinery which 
plummeted 97 percent last month to 211 billion following a 48 
percent rise in june the commerce department attributed half the 
decline to a drop in orders for engines and turbines 
in a sign of strength however the closely watched nondefense 
capital goods sector rose 50 percent to 411 billion following a 
51 percent gain in june economists use this category as a 
barometer of business investment plans 
the department offered these other details of july activity 
electrical machinery up 13 percent to 198 billion following 
a june gain of 48 percent 
primary metals including steel up 08 percent to 119 
billion following a 51 percent drop 
transportation equipment up 23 percent to 342 billion after 
a 01 percent drop a large increase in aircraft orders offset 
declines in motor vehicles shipbuilding and tanks 
shipments of durable goods fell 30 percent to 1181 billion in 
july following drops of 10 percent in june and 03 percent in may

parents of delinquents no longer face a 
stockade but those who dont keep their kids in line can still draw 
hefty fines and jail time 
the city council revised its 2weekold ordinance monday leaving 
a provision that said parents of wayward youngsters could face up to 
30 days in jail but deleting the part that said two of those days 
could be spent on public display in a stockade 
the law didnt define a stockade the city doesnt have one and 
the council didnt vote the money to build one when it passed the 
law initially 
a provision in the earlier ordinance to publish photographs of 
parents of delinquents also was dropped as was a requirement that 
such parents place bumper stickers on their cars identifying 
themselves as irresponsible 
it was time to revise the ordinance because it had done its job 
of calling attention to the problem of juvenile crime in this city 
of 4500 with a sevenmember police force said city attorney 
charles sidney gibson 
but he said a tough ordinance was needed because were going 
to have a dangerous situation here were going to pull some kid in 
some night and hell be dead 
the old ordinance was passed following a street fight that drew a 
crowd of 250 people and because of an overall increase in crime 
during the summer that police chief jerry melton said could be 
attributed mostly to juveniles 
like the old ordinance the revised version says parents will 
receive a warning the first time their children are caught violating 
an 11 pm to 530 am curfew the second time parents will face 
up to 30 days in jail and up to a 500 fine or 20 hours of community 
service 
under the new ordinance parents may not permit their children to 
possess drugs or permit their children to have firearms without 
parental supervision 
some people at mondays meeting strongly objected to a provision 
saying parents cannot leave children under 12 unsupervised for more 
than an hour but gibson insisted that it would take only an hour to 
produce a potentially deadly situation 
parents also objected to a part of the ordinance that prohibits 
gatherings of two or more minors with riotous conduct

attorney general dick thornburgh is under fire 
for saying that investigators may subpoena telephone records of 
reporters who have been leaked government information 
while we feel strongly about leaks forcing reporters to 
disclose their sources is anathema to the first amendment reps 
don edwards dcalif and charles schumer dny said monday in a 
letter to thornburgh 
we are opposed to forcing reporters to disclose their sources 
through compulsory process or subpoenas for reporters telephone 
records 
thornburghs contention on sundays nbctvs meet the press 
that supreme court actions indicate such a search would be permitted 
under the first amendment also drew criticism from jane kirtley 
executive director of the reporters committee for freedom of the 
press 
i am repeatedly appalled that the attorney general seems to 
feel justified in ignoring guidelines that have served both the 
interests of the news media and the justice department very well for 
10 years kirtley said 
i think it shows a total lack of appreciation of the first 
amendment interests that were recognized by his predecessors she 
said 
kirtley said the supreme court declined to hear a 1978 case that 
addressed the issue reporters committee vs atampt 
the justice department has been investigating a news leak this 
spring that led to a cbs news report on an fbi investigation 
involving rep william gray dpa various department officials have 
been questioned by fbi agents and at least one has appeared before a 
grand jury 
as stories about gray abounded in the midst of the house party 
leadership election the justice department took the unusual step of 
announcing that he was not the subject of an investigation 
gray was elected house democratic whip 
a source said monday that the justice department was considering 
subpoenaing the telephone records of cbs reporter rita braver who 
first reported the story the network learned about the possible 
subpoena and contacted the department the source said 
tom goodman a new yorkbased spokesman for cbs said the records 
had not been subpoenaed justice department spokesman dan eramian 
declined to comment 
edwards chairman of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights and schumer who chairs the subcommittee on criminal 
justice also denounced the departments plan to prosecute 
government officials for leaking information 
you are invoking the statute on theft of government property 
which really has nothing to do with leaks edwards and schumer 
wrote congress has not adopted a criminal statute for leaks and 
certainly never intended the theft of property law to be used in 
this way 
the revision of the departments 11yearold policy intended to 
protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution was announced 
aug 2 in testimony submitted to congress 
thornburgh said aug 3 that he wouldnt prosecute reporters who 
obtain news leaks about criminal investigations but would charge 
federal officials who are their sources 
the statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in 
misusing sensitive information that comes to them in an official 
capacity thornburgh said 
accurate leaks have a tendency to compromise ongoing 
investigations he said if they are inaccurate they have a 
tendency to unjustifiably smear the reputations of persons who are 
the subject of the leak

an inquest opened today into the sinking of a 
pleasure boat on the river thames and new safety regulations went 
into effect police raised the death toll to 26 after another body 
was discovered 
police said 31 others are missing and believed dead from the 
accident sunday in which the marchioness was rammed by a 
sandandgravel dredger the bowbelle and 79 survived 
earlier police said 37 were missing and 87 survived 
the transport and general workers union said crewmen based at 
westminster pier near the houses of parliament decided at a mass 
meeting early today to cancel all pleasure boat sailings until the 
wreckage is removed 
the men feel very sad about what has happened and they feel 
they just cant operate while the marchioness wreck is still lying 
there said union spokesman michael cashman 
the latest body was found near battersea about 2 miles upstream 
from the wreckage police said 
the marchioness was resting on a sandy bank at the riverside near 
the accident site exposed to view at low tides 
a young crowd of guests from the worlds of fashion and banking 
were partying aboard the 90ton pleasure boat which sank in the 
fastflowing tidal river within a few minutes 
at a london coroners court the inquest into the 16 bodies which 
have been identified opened briefly and was then adjourned by 
coroner dr paul knapman it will resume after other inquiries are 
completed under british law the inquest had to open before the 
victims could be buried 
two new regulations for pleasure boats on the busy thames went 
into effect today they were announced monday by transport secretary 
cecil parkinson 
one covers checks on passenger numbers captains are already 
required to count passengers to ensure the boats are not overloaded 
now they will have to leave a record of passenger totals at their 
headquarters before sailing 
tidal cruises the company that owns the marchioness has denied 
the vessel was overcrowded 
the vessel hired for the 26th birthday party of london financier 
antonio vasconcellos went down shortly after leaving on a 1 
amtodawn trip 
the dredger struck the marchioness from behind and then ran it 
over shearing off the pleasure boats top deck the wreckage 
carried underwater scores of people who had been drinking and 
dancing below deck 
vasconcellos and the captain stephen faldo were among those 
still missing 
the other new regulation says pleasure boat passengers must be 
given more information about what to do in an emergency up to now 
passengers have not normally been given any instructions about 
escape routes or safety equipment 
a scotland yard spokeswoman said monday that police investigators 
are considering bringing criminal charges over the disaster she 
said charges of unlawful killing roughly similar to 
manslaughter and other related charges are being considered but she 
refused to elaborate 
police on monday said they had released the dredgers captain and 
second mate who were arrested and questioned after the sinking 
they said they also interviewed the five other members of the 
dredgers crew 
along with police the department of transports marine accident 
investigation branch and the port of london authority were 
investigating the accident 
the independent and evening standard newspapers on monday 
reported a disagreement had developed between the two captains over 
which vessel had the right of way under the central span of 
southwark bridge where the collision occurred 
it seems that both captains thought that they were in the 
right but technically the actions of both could be held up to 
scrutiny the standard quoted an unnamed river authority source as 
saying 
but jane carmichael of tidal cruises said that although smaller 
craft usually stick to the side arches faldo was correct to move 
through the center sunday because of tide conditions 
we do not know what went wrong she said our captain was 
acting totally correctly 
police said they listened taperecorded radio traffic between the 
captains of both vessels and shore control for clues into the cause 
of the crash 
scotland yard declined to comment on the newspaper reports

a career marine infected with the same aids virus 
that killed his wife and son testified in his 55 million lawsuit 
that government doctors passed the disease to his family through a 
tainted transfusion 
dressed in civilian clothes and maintaining a stoic demeanor 
chief warrant officer martin gaffney told the court monday that 
government doctors botched his wifes pregnancy and eventually 
decimated his family 
gaffneys testimony came on the opening day of his nonjury trial 
in his lawsuit against the federal government in us district court 
his daughter maureene 6 the only member of the family to 
escape infection sat in the courtroom with a relative who gave her 
a coloring book 
gaffney has said he filed the lawsuit primarily to provide for 
his daughter since she may well become an orphan 
its a relief just to finally be here gaffney said 
at issue is gaffneys charge that doctors at the navy regional 
medical center in long beach calif were negligent in the handling 
of his wifes 1981 pregnancy the couples son was stillborn and 
gaffneys wife then was given a blood transfusion tainted with the 
deadly virus the lawsuit alleges 
the couples 13monthold son john born after an ensuing 
pregnancy died in 1986 tests determined he and the parents all had 
the aids virus the mother mutsuko gaffney 38 died in may 1987 
had mrs gaffney received appropriate treatment the gaffney 
family today would be intact and happy gaffneys attorney jaclyn 
mckenney said before us district judge rya zobel 
assistant us attorney marianne bowler countered that navy 
doctors maintained an adequate and professional standard of care 
during mrs gaffneys pregnancy 
gaffney who tested positive for the aids virus but so far shows 
no symptoms of the disease testified that a navy doctor in long 
beach saw his wife sometime around her due date in august 1981 and 
declined to induce labor saying he likes to have these things 
happen naturally and let nature take its course 
when mrs gaffney went to the hospital on sept 19 complaining of 
abdominal pains she was seen only by a nurse who sent her home 
gaffney testified on sept 21 she returned to the hospital with 
similar pains and was told her baby had died sometime over the past 
two days 
mrs gaffney underwent a cesarean section and was then given two 
units of blood one of themwas infected with the aids virus 
mckenney said monday 
navy officials and a massachusetts general hospital internist who 
treated mrs gaffney traced the two donors one of whom tested 
negative for the aids virus the other discharged from the navy for 
homosexual activity refused to be tested 
gaffney and his daughter now live on base at the south weymouth 
naval air station about 15 miles south of boston 
shortly after gaffney was transferred there base officials 
refused to allow maureene to attend the day care center because of 
the familys history of aids infection gaffney called upon sen 
edward m kennedy to intervene and maureene was eventually allowed 
to attend 
doctors said there is no explanation why some children born to a 
woman with aids get the disease and others do not they also say it 
is unlikely maureene will develop aids at this late date

karoly grosz general secretary of the 
ruling communist party said in remarks published today he is ready 
to step down to avoid a power struggle within the political 
leadership but the party must decide 
groszs statement in an interview with the party daily 
nepszabadsag was the first time he acknowledged the power struggle 
and it appeared to signal his defeat by party reformers 
many people believe that the main cause of the current problems 
is the power struggle within the party i would not like to have 
a power struggle as it would not do any good to either the party or 
the country grosz said in interview excerpts carried today by the 
state news agency mti 
however he was also quoted as saying even if i myself want to 
retire it is the party that will bring the decision 
grosz gave no date for whenhe might retire a party congress is 
scheduled to start oct 6 
on sunday party secretary pal ivanyi told a rally marking the 
day of st stephen the founder of the hungarian state that grosz 
was planning to resign 
in a june interview with the independent daily mai nap grosz 
said he wanted to quit after elections next year 
the communists have said they will allow candidates other than 
their own to run in those elections due by june they would be the 
first freely contested races in this country since the communists 
consolidated power in 1948 
grosz became communist party leader in may 1988 he is considered 
a party centrist who jockeyed for middle ground between the 
reformers and party conservatives wary of moves toward a multiparty 
system

scapegoat in the prison break by two inmates whose wives allegedly 
commandeered a helicopter and adds that he never got an order to 
shoot at the craft 
guard russ ellis was suspended with pay following the spectacular 
escape friday from the arkansas valley correction facility he had 
been stationed in a tower and armed with a 308caliber rifle 
he said his finger was on the trigger and he was ready to shoot 
if he had gotten an order from prison superintendent jim brittain 
convicts ralph brown and freddie gonzales were captured with 
their wives about eight hours later in holdrege neb 400 miles 
away after a shootout with law enforcement officers they had 
transferred from the helicopter to a van a few miles from the 
prison leaving the helicopter pilot tied up but unhurt 
the inmates and their wives patricia gonzales and rebecca brown 
were charged monday in nebraska with attempted murder bail was set 
at 1 million for all of them except brown whose arraignment was 
postponed until later today because he is still under treatment for 
a hand wound suffered in the shootout 
on monday ellis 25 gave his first detailed account of what 
happened when the helicopter landed in the prison exercise yard 
radio traffic became heavy and everybody was yelling on the 
radio ellis said i was prepared to use lethal force when

could have thats my job i was prepared but i didnt hear the 
order 
he said he heard brittain order another tower to use lethal 
force but he did not hear that order directed to the tower where he 
was stationed 
in addition he said tower 1 was in my line of fire plus the 
helicopter was still in the compound if i would have shot it it 
would have exploded and crashed into the cellblock a lot of people 
would have been killed 
brittain said monday he would not respond to ellis account of 
the helicopter escape 
thats what the personnel hearing is all about brittain 
said hes had the weekend to think it over and hes come up with 
some interesting suggestions 
sometimes radio transmissions are recorded at the prison but 
ellis said fridays escape happened too fast and no recordings were

explorers set out for the wreck of 
the edmund fitzgerald today hoping to use an underwater robot to 
get new explanations for the lake superior disaster almost 14 years 
ago 
the 729foot steel freighter took on water and snapped in two 
during a storm in november 1975 sending it and all 29 crewmen to 
the bottom of lake superior no bodies were recovered 
the threeday expedition began early today from whitefish point 
under rainy skies researchers will use a robot carrying video 
cameras to reach the wreck 556 feet beneath the surface said tom 
farnquist director of the great lakes shipwreck historical society 
and one of three expedition leaders 
the search will test newly developed video equipment and its uses 
for underwater archeology 
science aside the carrot in there is wow we get to see the 
fitzgerald farnquist said monday 
the wreck of the fitzgerald lies about 17 miles northwest of 
whitefish point on michigans upper peninsula 
the fitzgerald was hauling more than 27000 tons of iron ore from 
superior wis to detroit when it ran into a gale on the eastern 
end of lake superior the boat disappeared from radar without even a 
distress call 
the wreck was memorialized in song by gordon lightfoot and 
remains the subject of public fascination farnquist said 
its the most historic of the recent wrecks and it shouldnt 
have happened in this modern age of sailing he said from his 
home in sault ste marie 
a us coast guard team in 1976 used a cablecontrolled device to 
record black and white video images of the boat the front half of 
which still sat upright in the mud bottom farnquist said this 
weeks expedition should provide clear footage that could shed light 
on what exactly caused the boat to break 
the federal fish and wildlife service is loaning its research 
vessel grayling for the expedition television station wqed from 
pittsburgh will film the search for the national geographic society 
the cameracarrying robot from deep sea systems international of 
falmouth mass can venture 150 feet away from its submersible 
cage allowing researchers to cover 300 feet of the wreckage at a 
time 
its going to be great farnquist said

national police said today they started 
proceedings to hand over a reputed cocaine finance chief to the 
united states in a test of a new emergency plan for extraditing 
alleged top narcotics traffickers 
eduardo martinez romero arrested during the weekend in the 
northern department of sucre is wanted in the united states in 
connection with the laundering of vast sums of cocaine profits 
col oscar carmona chief of the national police forces judicial 
investigations division told reporters that proceedings for 
martinez extradition began this morning the government responding 
to a wave of assassinations launched an emergency crackdown on the 
drug underworld on friday that included a new extradition program 
carmona said the procedure included notes to the justice ministry 
and to the us embassy informing them of the detention of martinez 
a 35yearold economist 
a us embassy spokesman said he had no immediate comment on 
martinez arrest 
according to col alfonso arellano the police commander for 
sucre martinez was nabbed in a raid on a rural estate in the 
caribbean coastal town of tolu about 340 miles north of bogota 
there was no resistance really because of the surprise with 
which they police agents acted arellano said in an interview 
broadcast monday night by the private national radio network radio 
caracol 
the bogota daily el tiempo on monday reported that when 
arrested martinez had none of the heavily armed bodyguards that 
customarily accompany drug lords it said that in statements made 
while jailed in bogota martinez declared his innocence 
at no time have i had links to the medellin cartel and i dont 
know any of its members he was quoted as saying 
the arrest raid was one of more than 300 carried out nationwide 
since an emergency crackdown launched by the government late friday 
in response to the assassinatin by the cocaine cartels of a 
presidential candidate a police colonel and a magistrate more 
raids were being reported regularly 
according to national police headquaters today 10972 people 
have been detained nationwide in 467 raids by police and military 
forces so far in the crackdown 
police said a total of 473 arms many of them highpowered 
automatic weapons have been seized authorities impounded 1140 
cars and trucks 22 yachts 135 planes and 15 helicopters police 
said they said that in many cases the aircraft were being 
grounded only until the owners could prove they had been 
legitimately purchased and were being used for legal activities 
as part of the crackdown president virgilio barco also signed a 
decree empowering his government to summarily extradite suspected 
traffickers without approval by colombias judges many of whom have 
been threatened or killed by hitmen us officials had been 
pressuring barco to take the action since the supreme court in 1987 
nullified a 1979 extradition agreement 
in washington a spokesman for the us drug enforcement 
administration frank shults said as many as 100 colombians are 
being considered for possible extradition including three leaders 
of the medellin cartel gonzalo rodriguez gacha pablo escobar and 
jorge luis ochoa 
the drug cartel is believed responsible for bringing up to 80 
percent of the colombian cocaine into the united states authorities 
say 
president bush on monday praised the steps barco was taking and 
offered appropriate assistance as rapidly as possible a white 
house statement said it said barco told bush that sending in us 
troops was not necessary 
officials in washington said monday that the united states is 
preparing to send a small team of police experts to colombia to 
advise judges magistrates and journalists on how to improve 
security the special 5 million program was approved by congress 
more than a year ago 
according to officials martinez narrowly escaped capture by us 
drug enforcement administration agents earlier this year in panama 
he was allegedly in charge of finances for the powerful cartel of 
medellin an industrial city that serves as the worlds principal 
trafficking center for cocaine 
other reputed cartel leaders continued to elude arrest 
we havent yet been able to capture the drug cartel chiefs but 
we have struck hard against their immense fortunes army gen 
manuel bonnet locarno said monday in the southwestern city of cali 
another trafficking center 
the military claimed the raids and property seizures were 
inflicting a painful blow on the dealers economic empire 
early monday on bogotas northern fringes the army swarmed over 
an opulent compound owned by rodriguez gacha 
the estate included tennis soccer and basketball courts a duck 
pond with a water wheel a modern gym with weightlifting equipment 
an indoor swimming pool billards and ping pong tables and a pet 
eagle soldiers guarding the compound said it was just one of dozens 
of properties owned by rodriguez gacha 
scores of other properties owned by rodriguez gacha escobar and 
ochoa also were raided 
ronald caffrey special agent in charge of the atlanta office of 
the us drug enforcement administration confirmed monday that 
martinez romero was a defendant in the polar cap investigation 
of drug money laundering involving the medellin cartel caffrey said 
it was unclear whether he would be extradited to stand trial in the 
united states 
one former cartel leader carlos lehder was extradited to the 
united states in 1987 before the colombian supreme court struck 
down the extradition treaty lehder is now in federal prison in 
marion ill serving a life sentence without parole plus 135 years 
in the last eight years drug traffickers in the south american 
nation have killed more than 50 judges including a dozen supreme 
court justices as well as a justice minister an attorney general

kidnap molest and kill a boy in a pornographic videotape had 
advertised in computer bulletin boards according to a court 
document 
us attorney henry hudson disclosed monday that dean ashley 
lambey 34 of richmond va and daniel depew 28 of alexandria 
were arrested aug 14 after a sixmonth investigation involving more 
than 100 fbi agents in san francisco richmond and the washington 
dc area they were being held without bail pending grand jury 
action 
the two men charged with conspiracy to kidnap had not targeted 
a particular child hudson said the plan was to kidnap a child 
from northern virginia or purchase the child through a group of 
people he said 
lambey and depew used computer bulletin board networks to 
advertise their sexual preference 
one of the men said he could buy a child for 12000 from an 
outofstate source according to an official who spoke to the 
associated press on condition of anonymity 
authorities said the boy would be videotaped while being tortured 
for up to two weeks and his body washed in acid to remove evidence 
before being disposed of in a marsh in maryland 
the investigation began in february when an undercover california 
police officer tapped into a computer bulletin board system 
designed to assist people seeking contact with others interested 
in diverse sexual pursuits according to a court affidavit 
unsealed in richmond on monday 
the officer placed a message in the bulletin board seeking 
individuals interested in children lambey a real estate agent 
responded saying he liked boys between the ages of 8 and 13 and 
was interested in making a sexually explicit movie with children 
the document said 
lambey said in a telephone conversation with the police officer 
that i think the pleasure of doin it would be worth it the 
affidavit said 
san jose calif police chief joseph mcnamara whose officers 
were involved in the probe called the case a model of national 
law enforcement cooperation and singled out three undercover men 
for praise 
authorities said the california officers traveled to virginia 
several times and met with the suspects discussing the purchase of 
the child for use in the video before contacting federal officials 
who took over the case 
hudson said fbi agents from richmond and washington followed 
them 24 hours a day to make sure no child or citizen was placed in 
danger 
depew who works as a computer clerk stored detailed 
descriptions of his sadomasochistic acts under the heading of 
vital info on an office computer the affidavit said 
the two men face life in prison if convicted hudson said

five conservation organizations sued commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher claiming he is legally bound to require 
that shrimpers use devices protecting endangered sea turtles from 
drowning in their nets 
mosbacher suspended the regulations on the turtle excluder 
devices after shrimpers angry about having to use devices they 
claim reduce their catch by as much as onethird blockaded shipping 
channels along the texas gulf coast 
under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in a 
separate lawsuit filed by the national wildlife federation 
mosbacher then ordered shrimpers who dont use devices to limit 
their trawling times to 105 minutes 
the latest lawsuit filed late monday in us district court 
seeks to force mosbacher to resume enforcement of the suspended 
regulations 
the principal known cause of death for the endangered or threated 
sea turtles of breeding or subadult age is drowning in shrimp nets 
the lawsuit said the commerce department estimates more than 11000 
sea turtles will drown annually in the nets of american shrimp 
fishermen who do not use the excluder device 
comment on the lawsuit was not immediately available from the 
commerce department today 
defendants action in suspending the regulations and 
replacing them with ineffective inadequate interim regulations is 
causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs and their members by 
depriving them of the opportunity to study observe photograph and 
otherwise use and enjoy living sea turtles on their nesting beaches 
and in coastal waters the suit said 
the five conservation groups say suspension of the regulations 
and the limited trawls fail to provide for the effective 
conservation of five endangered species of sea turtles 
mosbachers actions were taken in disregared of the clear 
requirements of several laws including the endangered species act 
and the national environmental policy act the lawsuit said 
filing the lawsuit are the environmental defense fund national 
audubon society center for marine conservation greenpeaceusa 
and defenders of wildlife

disbarred lawyer william borders today refused 
for a third time to testify in the impeachment trial of federal 
judge alcee l hastings and was warned that his silence would mean a 
return to jail 
we do not have any interest in putting you in jail but that is 
the established procedure sen arlen specter rpa told borders 
after the onetime political power broker refused to answer 
questions 
a senate committee is gathering evidence against hastings a 
52yearold federal judge from florida accused of plotting with 
borders to obtain a 150000 payoff and lying about it to a jury 
that acquitted him in 1983 he also is charged with improper 
disclosure of wiretap information 
once the panel finishes its report the senate will vote on 
whether to remove hastings from the bench and thus take away his 
89500 salary the house impeached him last year 
borders served 33 months in federal prison following his 1982 
conviction on the conspiracy charge he has been disbarred and shorn 
of the considerable political influence officials say he wielded 
here in the late 1970s 
he was arrested in october 1981 as he pulled out of a suburban 
virginia motel with a garment bag packed with 125000 and a retired 
fbi agent masquerading as a racketeer by his side 
borders refused to answer questions from the senate committee on 
july 24 and july 27 even though he already had been granted 
immunity from prosecution he said requiring him to testify would 
violate his constitutional rights including his 5th amendment right 
against selfincrimination 
a court on aug 17 directed him to return to the senate committee 
and answer its questions or face jail for contempt of court 
specter the only senator on hand for todays session appeared 
to be irritated when borders sought to fence with him verbally over 
legal technicalities borders questioned why it was necessary to ask 
10 questions when it was clear he would not answer 
when were dealing with the integrity of a federal judge 
perhaps no number of questions would be excessive specter said 
borders also complained that he should not have to answer 
questions because a quorum of the 12member committee was not 
present 
but specter reminded him that before congress went on its august 
break the panel agreed that one lawmaker would constitute a quorum 
for purposes of hearing testimony from borders

a lithuanian government commission said 
in a report today that the small baltic republics annexation by the 
soviet union in 1940 was an international crime 
the report by a commission of the republics supreme soviet or 
parliament was published in the official press on the eve of the 
50th anniversary of the 1939 agreement between stalins soviet union 
and adolf hitlers germany that led to soviet annexation of 
lithuania and its sister baltic states latvia and estonia 
thousands of lithuanians were expected to gather later today for 
a rally in the capital vilnius to mark the anniversary on 
wednesday organizers are predicting that 15 million baltic 
residents will form a human chain from tallinn estonia on the gulf 
of finland to the polish border 
the realization of the illegal germansoviet agreements of 
19391941 constitute an international crime said the published 
report 
elimination of the consequences are not only an internal matter 
of the ussr but a matter of europe and the entire society of 
world governments 
the agreements predetermined a loss of sovereignty and 
independence of the lithuanian republic and its forced inclusion in 
the ussr said the report which later will go before the full 
parliament 
a commission of the congress of peoples deputies national 
parliament in moscow also has investigated the pact and in a 
preliminary draft said it should be declared null and void 
but it stopped short of criticizing the incorporation of the 
thenindependent baltic states into the soviet union 
the lithuanian report goes much further than moscow has been 
willing to go and reflects how strong the grassroots reform 
movement sajudis and its backers have become in the republic 
soviet communist party politburo member alexander n yakovlev in 
an interview with the party newspaper pravda said last week there 
was no connection between the secret protocol under which stalin and 
hitler divided eastern europe into spheres of influence and 
lithuanias decision to join the soviet union 
yakovlev is a close adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev and 
the soviet communist partys chief ideologist he also is chairman 
of the national commission on the stalinhitler agreement 
however at a news conference in vilnius the lithuania communist 
partys chief ideologist justas paleckis told reporters that 
all lithuania is striving for sovereignty and independence we 
arent afraid of that word 
he said independence could not be achieved soon and the exact 
nature of it remains to be determined

forecasters today upgraded tropical storm erin to 
hurricane status but said the seasons third hurricane continued to 
pose little threat to land 
a report from a ship that passed near erins center led 
forecasters today to upgrade the midatlantic storm to a hurricane 
with 75 mph winds the national hurricane center said 
the ship relayed its observations after the storm pushed through 
a lowpressure trough that boosted its strength forecasters said 
earlier in the day the storms winds had been estimated at only 45 
mph 
erins center was located at 10 am edt about 1100 miles 
southwest of the azores near 297 north latitude and 447 west 
longitude said forecasters at the hurricane center in suburban 
coral gables 
the system moving northnorthwest at about 17 mph was given 
little chance of making it to the united states as a hurricane 
forecasters said 
while the hurricane posed no danger to land it was touching 
shipping lanes 
its like the i95 of the ocean between bermuda and puerto 
rico said bob ebaugh weather service specialist referring to 
the interstate highway that runs along the east coast 
the weather service routinely requests information from ships 
sailing within 300 nautical miles of a storm he said 
erin formed as a tropical depression friday off africa and became 
a named storm sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph 
hurricanes are formed when winds hit 74 mph 
there have been seven depressions in the current atlantic 
hurricane season which runs from june 1 to nov 30 before erin 
four had become named storms and two of those had developed into 
hurricanes

the bush administration said today it 
is ready to provide a wide array of assistance to help colombia 
battle drug lords but it reiterated that us troops are not an 
option 
president bush did not offer colombian president virgilio barco 
vargas military assistance in a telephone call monday night nor 
did president barco request it said white house spokeswoman alixe 
glen 
barco during his conversation with the vacationing president 
reinforced earlier statements by bush aides that us troops would 
not be dispatched to colombia according to a white house statement 
issued late monday 
we are always prepared to give colombia the assistance and 
support they request short of sending us troops ms glen said 
at a news briefing today 
however she said barcos government has not said what additional 
help it wants there havent been any specific requests for 
anything other than what the united states has been doing she 
said 
well provide training research operations like that ms 
glen said she said one possibility would be to give colombian 
judges the same antiterrorist training given to us diplomats if 
such help were requested by colombia 
us officials said one of the biggest helps to barcos crackdown 
on drug traffickers may be the promise to begin extradition 
proceedings against drug figures wanted in the united states 
they drug lords fear extradition and they dont want to be 
prosecuted in the united states its a real weapon he barco can 
use said presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
mondays white house statement said bush called barco to express 
condolences over the assassination last week of the leading 
colombian presidential candidate luis carlos galan 
the president assured president barco of his strong support 
and expressed his admiration for the steps he has taken to restore 
law and order the statement said 
and while the statement said the bush administration would 
render appropriate assistance as rapidly as possible it added 
president barco indicated he had read press speculation about 
the use of us troops in colombia he affirmed to the president 
that us troops would not be necessary 
earlier white house chief of staff john sununu voiced a similar 
view 
i think the tradition in the western hemisphere has been a 
reluctance on the part of anybody to ask for troops and i think 
theres a reluctance on the part of the president to commit troops 
unless the situations are extreme sununu told reporters 
sununu whose monday meeting with bush included a discussion of 
the presidents upcoming antidrug plan said the united states has 
no plans to use us troops to combat drug trafficking in colombia 
or anywhere else in south america 
his comments seemed an effort to soften attorney general dick 
thornburghs suggestion sunday that the united states should 
consider sending military troops to colombia if requested by the 
government of that violencetorn nation 
bush today again had no public events on his schedule as he 
enjoys a vacation marked by morning jogs tennis boating and golf 
first lady barbara bush however was returning to washington for 
an eye examination at walter reed army hospital for a lingering 
condition stemming from graves disease a thyroid imbalance 
despite treatment earlier this year with radioactive iodine mrs 
bush continues to be troubled by eye irritation and some double 
vision aides said 
sununu said bushs antidrug package which the president will 
unveil in a televised speech to the nation sept 5 from the oval 
office is largely complete 
the aide put the final price tag at from 75 billion to 8 
billion to a large extent the program will involve shuffling funds 
from existing antidrug programs into expanded new ones 
the program also will call for 1 billion to 2 billion in new 
annual federal spending 
sununu said the plans focus is on the domestic side 
it involves dealing with the issues associated with law 
enforcement within our country with rehabilitation assistance to 
those who are addicted to drugs 
it deals with programs on education and thats the primary 
thrust but there is a component of additional assistance for 
countries around the world that may ask for some economic aid to 
allow them to fight the problem sununu said

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods tumbled 19 percent in july to the lowest level in 
nine months the government said tuesday providing further evidence 
of a weakening economy 
it was the fourth drop this year in the sector which includes 
items from washing machines to warships expected to last three or 
more years the sector is considered a bellwether of the economys 
performance 
the commerce department said demand for durable goods totaled a 
seasonally adjusted 1229 billion last month the lowest level 
since october 1988 
orders rose faster than expected increasing 14 percent in june 
that followed a 45 percent plunge in may the steepest drop in 10 
months orders had risen in april and march and fallen in february 
and january 
the numbers are up and down up and down but overall the downs 
outweigh the ups in 1989said economist cynthia latta of 
drimcgraw hill inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
the latest drop came despite moves by the federal reserve board 
since early june to nudge interest rates lower earlier the central 
bank had been raising rates to dampen economic vigor and 
inflationary pressure 
the federal open market committee the central bank panel 
controlling shortterm interest rates was meeting privately tuesday 
to set monetary policy through early october 
even with the latest sign of sluggishness most economists said 
the fed would not lower interest rates further anytime soon 
the feds focus is on inflation and its not going to want to 
loosen as long as inflation is running between 45 percent and 5 
percent latta said 
durable goods are among the sectors most sensitive to interest 
rates because consumers and businesses usually borrow to buy them 
the durable goods industry is one of the unfortunate casualties 
of the feds high interest rate policy said economist lawrence a 
hunter of the us chamber of commerce 
it clearly is time for the fed to show sympathy and to 
cease fire by lowering interest rates he said 
most of the weakness in july came in military orders which swing 
widely from month to month and nonelectrical machinery an 
important category which includes computers and a wide variety of 
industrial equipment 
military orders plunged 147 percent to 76 billion in july 
following a 174 percent rise in june excluding the defense 
category orders fell 09 percent in july after an 03 percent gain 
a month earlier 
nonelectrical machinery plummeted 97 percent last month the 
steepest drop in more than three years to 211 billion that 
followed a 48 percent rise in june the commerce department 
attributed half the decline to a drop in orders for engines and 
turbines 
in a sign of strength however the closely watched nondefense 
capital goods sector rose 50 percent to 411 billion following a 
51 percent gain in june analysts use this category as a barometer 
of business investment plans 
economist michael k evans a washingtonbased consultant said 
he expected durable goods sales to turn up later this year housing 
has begun to rebound in response to recent interest rate declines 
and that in turn will generate sales of appliances and furniture 
also consumer spending is strengthening now that a surge in 
inflation earlier this year has subsided he said 
the department offered these other details of july activity 
electrical machinery up 13 percent to 198 billion following 
a june gain of 48 percent 
primary metals including steel up 08 percent to 119 
billion following a 51 percent drop 
transportation equipment up 23 percent to 342 billion after 
a 01 percent drop a large increase in aircraft orders offset 
declines in motor vehicles shipbuilding and tanks 
shipments of durable goods fell 30 percent to 1181 billion in 
july following drops of 10 percent in june and 03 percent in may

four people were killed and 50 wounded in 
a night of shelling that followed the christian commanders offer to 
talk peace with moslem adversaries police said tuesday 
syria had not replied by tuesday to gen michel aouns proposal 
but its militia allies rejected the offer 
france dispatched two more warships to the eastern mediterranean 
bringing the number to eight including an aircraft carrier the 
french who governed lebanon by mandate until 1943 have said their 
purpose is to evacuate the 7000 french nationals in the country if 
necessary 
police said artillery and rocket exchanges tailed off at dawn and 
settled into a pattern of intermittent mortar fire across the line 
that divides moslem west beirut from the christian eastern sector 
by police count 789 people have been killed and 2190 wounded in 
the artillery war that began march 8 between a moslem alliance led 
by syria which has 40000 soldiers in lebanon and the 20000 men 
of aouns christian army command nearly all the casualties have 
been civilians 
acting premier salim hoss a sunni moslem leading a syrianbacked 
moslem cabinet issued a statement calling the maronite catholic 
generals offer a mine field any response to it is highly 
unlikely 
since a political crisis a year ago the hoss government has 
competed with one led by aoun 
on monday druse chieftain walid jumblatt described the generals 
offer as a trick to allow aoun a breathing spell to rearm and 
marshall his forces 
a spokesman for aoun said privately the syrians were under arab 
and international pressure to stop their involvement in lebanon 
and were issuing fake statements on behalf of their allies to give 
the impression that lebanese parties are involved in the conflict 
not them 
in an interview published monday aoun expressed willingness to 
discuss lebanons future with leaders of the other side he did not 
make his customary demand that talks could not begin until syrian 
forces withdrew 
syrian troops are in lebanon under an arab league mandate issued 
in 1976 the year after the beginning of the sectarian civil war in 
which more than 150000 people have been killed 
aoun calls them an occupation army and has declared a war of 
liberation to drive them out 
us ambassador john mccarthy met with aoun and told reporters 
theres obviously no military solution to the problem for 
lebanon 
mccarthy said he met with aoun to emphasize that the military 
confrontation is not taking us anywhere and added we are 
delivering the same messages to damascus 
sheik mohammed rashid kabbani acting religious adviser of 
lebanons sunni moslems said violence cannot produce solutions 
he cautioned france to use its naval force with great wisdom 
defense ministry sources in paris said the antisubmarine 
destroyer jean de vienne and oil supply ship meuse would join the 
six other vessels already sent to the area they include two other 
destroyers and a frigate in addition to the aircraft carrier foch 
syrias militia allies describe the naval buildup as an attempt 
by france to reassert dominance over the region 
iranian newspapers printed warnings to the west that any 
interference in lebanon would further aggravate the situation 
iran backs moslem extremists believed to hold most of the 16 
western hostages in lebanon who include eight americans and has 
about 2000 revolutionary guards in syriancontrolled east lebanon 
the nationalist front a group of leftist militias allied with 
syria said its artillerymen fired on six ships before dawn and 
prevented them from reaching ports on the christianheld coast north 
of beirut 
a nationalist front statement said the gunners scored direct 
hits on the lead ship forcing the whole group to sail away it 
did not identify any of the vessels 
the spokesman for aouns command denied the claim 
to begin with there were no ships heading to our ports this 
morning he said on condition of anonymity also no force in 
lebanon but the syrian army is capable of detecting and opening fire 
at a moving maritime target 
syrian and allied forces have besieged the 310squaremile 
christian enclave north and east of beirut since march 12 four days 
after the battle began 
they shell the coast to keep aouns forces and the 1 million 
christians in the enclave from receiving supplies iraq the main 
arab foe of syria supplies most of aouns arms 
moslem security sources said the syrians were providing tanks 
howitzers and mortars to the 22000 moslem soldiers led by maj gen 
sami khatib and to jumblatts druse militia syrias closest ally in 
lebanon 
one said the syrians have been flooding their allies with 
weapons and ammunition for more than a week now it seems they are 
preparing them for a major battle with aoun 
khatibs forces poorly equipped have stayed out of the fighting

state attorney general charlie brown has 
abruptly resigned in exchange for an end to a grand jury 
investigation of allegations that he lied under oath and of his 
campaign financial records 
and today the grand jury indicted a former secretary to brown on 
charges that she tried to extort money from him in exchange for 
keeping quiet about allegations that he got her pregnant 
under an agreement with kanawha county prosecutor bill forbes 
brown cannot discuss his innocence or guilt regarding the grand jury 
investigation 
i dont believe in beating dead horses i believe justice was 
done forbes said at a monday night news conference 
if you resign from the attorney generals office of the state 
thats a pretty darned harsh penalty forbes said 
at a news conference today brown said his decision to resign was 
based on family obligations including concerns he had to protect 
his young daughter who is at the center of a child custody dispute 
that gave rise to the perjury allegation 
no public official is more important that the office he or she 
holds brown said but my biggest fear was something much worse 
ublicity about my childs life welfare and current home 
environment 
it is the second time this year a major west virginia state 
official has quit amid allegations of misconduct treasurer a james 
manchin who was accused of mismanaging a state investment fund that 
lost an estimated 279 million and was impeached by the house 
resigned last month just before his senate trial was to begin 
it also was the second criminal case against brown since he took 
office in 1984 
browns resignation was effective at 5 pm monday 
it was in the best interest of the state the best interest of 
mr brown and the best interest of all concerned forbes said 
gov gaston caperton will appoint an interim attorney general 
who will serve until the next election 
forbes said his office worked very intensely on the 
investigation for four weeks he said browns attorney called his 
office about noon monday and agreed to the arrangement which forbes 
said the prosecutors office first offered about a week ago before 
the grand jury began meeting 
brown 39 a democrat had testified thursday friday and monday 
before the grand jury forbes said he had planned to ask for a vote 
on charges sometime monday afternoon or today 
in 1986 brown was acquitted on charges that he solicited his 
staff for campaign contributions the jury agreed with his defense 
that because he solicited the contributions after the 1984 election 
to help pay off his campaign debts the actions did not violated a 
state law prohibiting state officials from soliciting contributions 
for future campaigns 
the latest grand jury investigation centered on browns testimony 
in a child custody hearing involving his exwife alice sue 
hypesbrown and their 5yearold daughter 
forbes has confirmed that the grand jury was looking into a 
report that brown had denied writing a note that was introduced as 
evidence in the hearing then later admitted writing it 
brown acknowledged that he denied writing the note but said that 
it was a mistake and that he realized it almost immediately he said 
he requested a brief recess and when the hearing resumed he 
corrected his testimony 
in a statement today brown said that even though he had 
corrected the statements he made during the hearing he still would 
have faced potential months of protracted litigation if indicted 
the charleston gazette reported two weeks ago that the note 
involved a request for 50000 from browns former secretary who 
the paper said had been impregnated by brown had an abortion and 
demanded the money to keep quiet 
the secretary brenda k simon 35 of columbus ohio today was 
indicted on one count each of extortion and obtaining money under 
false pretenses the extortion count carries a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison while the false pretenses charge carries a 
maximum penalty of 10 years 
shortly after the indictment was announced this morning 
attorneys for simon withdrew a 3 million libel lawsuit against the 
gazette saying they didnt want the suit to jeopardize simons 
criminal defense 
forbes said he dont know how much money was allegedly extorted 
saying reports have varied from 7500 to 50000 
there was no immediate comment from simon telephone calls to her 
home went unanswered 
in addition the grand jury subpoenaed browns campaign records 
from 1984 through 1988 
browns brother sherrod brown is ohios secretary of state

about 200000 soviets are expected to emigrate this 
year and more than 2 million will make visits abroad because of 
eased travel restrictions the head of the countrys visa agency 
said tuesday 
about 107000 soviets already have received permission to leave 
for good this year said rudolf kuznetsov head of the agency known 
as uvir 
the agency also approved 1700000 applications for visits abroad 
in the first six months of 1989 three times the number for all of 
1987 he said 
most of the emigrants go to the united states and west germany 
the strict soviet restrictions on travel and emigration have long 
been a target of censure from the west tens of thousands of jews 
and other soviets were refused exit visas becoming known as 
refuseniks and the us congress linked tariffs on imported 
soviet goods with emigration to try to pressure the soviets to let 
more people out 
now kuznetsov said at a briefing fewer than 1 percent of 
applications are turned down and almost always for reasons of 
secrecy those refused say officials still apply the criterion of 
secrecy arbitrarily 
a draft law on the liberalization of soviet travel control is 
almost ready to be submitted to the legislature which will meet 
next month it brings soviet emigration rules closer in line with 
western practice but still requires wouldbe emigres to receive an 
invitation from a firm friend or relative 
lots of our citizens dont know the language and other 
things he said and they should at least be met by someone 
in general however the new law takes the approach of lets 
assume that all our people are honorable people instead of 
meriting only suspicion and tight control kuznetsov said 
he cautioned that even with passage of the law soviet travel 
would still be subject to technical snarls and red tape 
international tickets on aeroflot the soviet airline are in 
such hot demand that people must wait months and even years to buy 
them they also have to wait days or weeks in line to change rubles 
into dollars or other hard currency 
we held people back for a long time and now were resolving 
things but give us time to solve a series of technical problems 
kuznetsov said 
us embassy officials say soviets are registering their intent 
to emigrate to the united states at an annual rate of 120000 
about 50000 have left this year for west germany primarily 
ethnic germans 
president bush has said if the soviets enact the proposed changes 
in the travel law he will urge congress to pass a oneyear waiver 
of the amendment that links the tariffs with emigration

president najib said tuesday the afghan 
people are tired of the 11yearold civil war and his marxist 
government is prepared to accept any suggestion that will end it 
in outlining a new peace plan he called for an international 
peace conference attended by afghanistan iran pakistan india and 
china with the united states and soviet union as guarantors of an 
agreement 
his plan includes elections six months after a ceasefire does 
not meet demands by moslem guerrillas that the 42yearold former 
intelligence chief step down 
our people are fed up with the continuation of this war of 
attrition in which innocent people are dying the government of 
afghanistan is prepared to accept any suggestion toward a peaceful 
settlement najib told reporters at the gulkhana presidential 
palace 
western experts had predicted the ussupported guerrillas would 
oust najibs government soon after soviet military forces withdrew 
on feb 15 six months later they have failed twice to capture 
jalalabad 75 miles east of kabul and are squabbling among 
themselves 
kabul government officials said the najib plan makes a new 
concession to the guerrillas talks on forming a broadbased 
consultative council would be held before a ceasefire rather than 
after to quiet suspicion that the government would not negotiate in 
good faith 
a sixmonth truce leading to elections would begin when the 
council was established the council would organize a broadbased 
coalition government to draft a new constitution and electoral law 
which would be approved by a traditional loyah jirga or grand 
assembly of prominent afghans 
guerrilla leaders have rejected previous government peace plans 
because all include najib and his ruling communist party in a 
coalition 
najib said he was ready to give up the presidency and even his 
life to achieve peace but added that ignoring the reality of the 
party armed forces and current situation in afghanistan would only 
intensify the war 
billions of dollars have been spent here he said all 
kinds of deadly weapons have been accumulated here are all these 
efforts to get najib to step aside does that mean all the 
atrocities committed in the country are just to get rid of najib 
in our opinion instead of talking about the removal of the 
party or the person lets talk about the participation of people 
and parties in trying to achieve peace 
najib claimed the united states was supplying rockets with 
cluster bombs to the guerrillas and was guilty of the mass 
massacre of civilians as a result 
he also said judgments about the afghan government by other 
nations including those in the west were being radically 
changed 
we are confident that even the us administration is 
realizing the futility of the continuation of war and will consider 
the realities of afghan society as a basis for making new 
policies he declared 
if the guerrillas honestly want a settlement of the problem 
and they say they control 85 percent of the country he said 
why are they afraid of elections why are they using rockets of 
mass killing 
najib said the united states and pakistan believed the 
unmediated agreement ended with the soviet withdrawal but the 
main issue was to stop intervention in afghanistan and provide for 
the return of afghan refugees 
if all sides remain faithful to the provisions of the geneva 
agreement it is my opinion that peace soon will prevail in our 
country he said 
at an international conference najib said we are ready that 
if prestigious and credible international guarantees are given we 
can tackle questions of the permanent neutrality of afghanistan and 
the demilitarization of the country 
the geneva agreement was signed by afghanistan and pakistan 
where about 35 million afghan refugees live and many guerrillas are 
based with the united states and soviet union as guarantors 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 were in the country when the withdrawal began on 
may 15 1988

researchers first hailed the image on voyagers photos as the 
rediscovery of the ghost arc a partial ring identified by the 
voyager 2 spacecraft on aug 11 but further analysis showed that 
the arc was a continuous ring around the planet 
it is neptunes first ring said bradford smith leader of 
the spacecraft imaging team the inner arc the one we were unable 
to find since the discovery aug 11 images is there and it is 
continuous all the way around 
voyager launched in 1977 is in the final stages of its 44 
billionmile trip to neptune it will pass by the outermost planet 
at 855 pm pdt thursday beaming images back to earth 
observations of neptune from earth had led astronomers to predict 
that the planet would be encircled by ring arcs partial rings the 
newly discovered ring is so faint that it was not visible from earth 
or from earlier voyager photographs smith said 
it just isnt enough material to be detected from the ground 
he said 
the ring appeared in a series of 16 photographs of the arc 
region they included better views of the other arc discovered aug 
11 researchers said that they expect to find more arcs as voyager 
passes behind neptune and scans the arc region while it is lit from 
behind by the sun 
ring arcs unlike anything seen around the other planets are 
composed of debris that could be the remnants of moons torn apart by 
gravitational forces or collisions researchers said 
voyagers observations of neptune on monday revealed a churning 
turbulent atmosphere with huge white clouds of frozen natural gas 
and a string of storms trailing behind an earthsized cyclone 
one small collection of clouds called the scooter is whirling 
around the planets surface once every 16 hours faster than 
anything else so far seen on neptune said bradford smith head of 
the voyager imaging team 
photographs of the planets biggest moon triton show it is 
brighter cooler and smaller than scientists had thought smith said 
the shots suggest triton may be partly covered with snow and frozen 
water 
it may snow there from time to time he said monday 
the pictures also show dark spots near tritons equator and a 
pinkish cast that may be from discolored frozen natural gas or 
methane researchers had speculated that triton might have oceans of 
liquid nitrogen but smith said any such oceans would have to be 
frozen over 
triton is an especially intriguing object smith said its 
in the wrong orbit its going backwards around neptune something 
truly catastrophic must have happened some time in its past 
scientists believe triton could have been a comet that collided 
with one of neptunes moons because it rotates in the opposite 
direction from the planet unlike most moons in the solar system 
edward stone the voyager project scientist said such a 
collision could have slowed triton enough to allow it to become 
trapped in a long oval orbit around neptune as that orbit 
gradually became more circular tidal forces would have caused the 
moon to heat perhaps turning triton into a ball of molten rock and 
water for 1 billion years he said 
if that were the case more detailed photographs later this week 
should show that triton has fewer meteorite craters than it 
otherwise would have 
its very difficult right now to say anything about whats 
going on on triton smith said 
voyager continued to snap pictures of neptune and triton today as 
it moved toward its closest encounter with neptune at 855 pm pdt 
thursday when it will pass 3000 miles from the planet 
it also searched for auroral lights over neptunes south pole and 
made further observations of neptunes weather and variations in 
brightness on tritons surface 
the pictures of triton showed it has a diameter of 1740 miles 
about fourfifths the size of earths moon and about half the size 
scientists previously thought 
researchers puzzled over the unexpected discovery of the intense 
weather on neptune 
neptune is an extremely dynamic planet with weather 
resembling jupiters but with less than 50 percent of jupiters 
energy smith said 
new photographs show that the great dark spot an earthsized 
cyclone discovered earlier by voyager is leaving in its wake a long 
tail of swirling storms 
voyager observed winds on uranus similar to those now being seen 
on neptune but without the turbulence 
neptune contains more heat than uranus and the turbulence could 
be the result of warmer material bubbling up from deep inside the 
mostly liquid planet smith said 
on aug 13 scientists issued their first weather forecast for 
neptune predicting with fairly close accuracy where the great dark 
spot would be last sunday 
its not perfect but weather forecasting isnt a perfect 
science smith said 
james warwick the scientist in charge of radio astronomy aboard 
viking estimated that neptunes day the time it takes to complete 
one rotation on its axis is 16 hours 
that estimate was based on observations of intense bursts of 
radio waves every 16 hours from neptunes magnetic field which 
varies with the planets rotation 
smith said observations of the atmosphere suggest that neptunes 
day may be longer than 16 hours warwick emphasized that his 
estimate was only a preliminary calculation

the environmental protection agency began 
filing lawsuits today in nearly a dozen states against demolition 
companies that allegedly failed to take proper precautions while 
working on asbestosridden buildings 
civil lawsuits were filed by the justice department in eight 
cities and additional court papers were expected to be filed later 
in the day naming a total of 34 defendants in connection with 
violations of asbestos removal requirements the epa said 
todays coasttocoast effort to punish violators is a message 
to those who ignore the law said henry habicht epa deputy 
administrator asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans and 
it can be a killer 
habicht said the agency intends to enforce requirements for 
safety measures when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civil 
penalties from companies that do not comply with the safeguards 
fines could range up to 25000 for each violation 
the epa officials declined to name all the defendants until the 
court papers were filed the eight lawsuits filed today involved 
work on school buildings in missouri kansas and washington state as 
well as various buildings from warehouses to restaurants in 
virginia illinois pennsylvania and nevada 
papers also were being prepared for civil action involving work 
on at least 80 school buildings in new york city officials said 
federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestos 
from buildings so that its microscopic fibers are not spread through 
the air violators can be subject to up to 25000 fine per 
violation and face criminal prosecution in some cases 
the inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer 
asbestosis a scarring of the lung and mesothelioma a cancer of 
the chest and abdomen asbestos was used in past years in insulation 
and other building materials 
improper removal practices pose health risks to construction 
workers and people who return to the building or to other nearby 
buildings since asbestos particles often linger in the air for a 
long time epa officials said 
the epa estimates that up to half of all asbestosinvolved 
renovations may be done without the precautions required by the 
federal clean air act 
the epa officials said none of the new actions involves criminal 
charges but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be over 
250000 
agency sources who asked not to be identified by name said 
papers were also to be filed later in the day as a result of 
violations in new york california and florida 
the projects cited include work on at least 80 new york city 
school buildings public schools in woodinville and kent wash a 
high school in kansas city mo a junior high school in holyrood 
kan and colleges in pittsburg kan and berea ohio 
in one case a contractor was being cited for transporting wine 
tanks by helicopter from a winery in san jose calif without 
removing asbestos insulation pads causing asbestos particles to 
scatter over miles of countryside 
other cases involved a nevada casino an apartment building in 
philadelphia a boiler room at the marine corps base at quantico 
va the seattletacoma airport and two seattle restaurants 
the epa crackdown comes only weeks after a harvard university 
study indicated that in many cases the improper removal of asbestos 
from buildings may pose more of a health risk than leaving the 
material in the building 
the study by harvards energy and environmental policy center 
suggested that if precautions are not taken the removal of 
asbestos may actually increase exposure to building occupants as 
well as workers involved in the renovation 
the epa has estimated that more than 730000 commercial buildings 
in the country still contain some asbestos material last year it 
received about 50000 notifications of renovation projects involving 
asbestos and that number is expected to increase by about 30 
percent this year according to agency officials 
by law the epa must be notified when renovation or demolitions 
involve buildings containing asbestos

a recording by ringo starr debuted in court 
tuesday blaring from a boom box as a judge weighed whether the song 
would be a 35 million hit or is an alcoholmarred embarrassment 
as the exbeatle claims 
music industry executives have said the record would be a 
guaranteed no 1 hitan attorney for memphis tenn producer 
chips moman said as he played the tape for fulton county superior 
court judge clarence cooper 
the song i can help is one of 14 starr recorded with moman 
in 1987 moman wants to release an album to coincide with starrs 
current smash us concert tour but starr says he is unhappy with 
his performance and the album would hurt his reputation 
cooper did not rule immediately on whether to extend a 30day 
order blocking the records release the restraining order expires 
thursday 
the judge after telling attorney thomas washburn to turn it 
down listened patiently to starrs upbeat rendition of billy 
swans 1975 hit 
starr who recently completed a muchpublicized treatment for 
alcoholism also objects to whiskey and soda a part of the 
collection his attorney robert o fleming jr said tuesday 
that is not a song mr starr is eager to have released on an 
album with his name and his picture on the cover fleming said 
alcoholism is an addiction he was suffering from when this 
music was recorded fleming said of his client 
neither starr nor moman attended tuesdays hearing 
though starr continued to enjoy high recognition his recording 
career had stagnated when he came to moman in 1987 washburn said 
moman whose work includes producing elvis presley in the late 
1960s has a reputation for reviving careers he said 
the point is this two people came together for the purpose of 
resurrecting a career washburn said this album would do this 
for ringo starr ringo starr hasnt had a hit since 1975 
washburn said the album if released now while starr is on tour 
could make 35 million 
fleming claimed however that the album would hurt starr at a 
time when his career has been boosted by his tour with his 
allstarr band fleming said that while the record features 
starr singing he does not play drums on it 
all an artist has is his style his name his professional 
reputation and his image fleming said here weve got an album 
with one of the most famous drummers in music history and hes not 
playing drums he doesnt want that 
moman has contended he invested 146239 in the starr project 
and said he rejected an offer by starr of 100000 to kill the album

relatives of those killed on pan am 
flight 103 met tuesday with police officers investigating the 
bombing of the new yorkbound flight and said they were confident 
the killers would soon be found 
bert ammerman us president of the victims of pan am flight 
103 called it the most positive meeting we have had so far 
i am very very confident after this meeting that the 
terrorists the people who carried this out are going to be 
identified and the next stage is to try to apprehend them he said 
the police are very confident it is going to take place and the 
terrorists are going to be identified we hope in the very near 
future 
asked why he though police would soon identify the bombers 
ammerman replied you are not naive enough and i am not naive 
enough to think that they the police are going to give us 
information about the criminal investigation 
there was a specific overview which makes us feel everything is 
being done and done most appropriately he said 
ammerman stayed monday night with the rev patrick keegans a 
roman catholic priest whose lockerbie house was destroyed when parts 
of the jumbo jet crashed on the southern scottish town on dec 21 
1988 all 259 people aboard were killed along with 11 people on the 
ground 
ammerman and five other americans were accompanied by jim squire 
head of the british relatives group 
eight months after lockerbie it appears to us that nothing has 
been done to increase security at heathrow airport squire said on 
the way into the meeting 
the relatives had a private meeting with detective chief 
superintendent john orr the senior investigating officer george 
esson chief constable of the dumfries and galloway regional police 
force and norman mcfadyen a senior scottish law officer 
the relatives later visited a building where the flight 103 
victims clothing and possessions not yet returned to next of kin 
were stored 
they saw rows of cardboard cartons and on top of one a battered 
gray suitcase several police officers wearing overalls and 
protective gloves were sorting through shirts shoes and other items 
of clothing 
this part was maybe the toughest part of the trip ammerman 
said it was very emotional 
on monday the relatives met transport secretary cecil parkinson 
and junior transport minister michael portillo who rebuffed their 
call for an immediate public inquiry into the gaps in airline 
security that allowed the bomb to be placed aboard the plane 
portillo said there was a frank exchange of views but ammerman 
said he told portillo we are definitely at odds with some of the 
statements and the approach of his department 
mr portillo is well aware that we are not pleased with his 
statements and we were not reassured he said we are not 
satisfied on the position that the department of transport has taken 
regarding the inquiry and regarding airport and airline security

the engineer who proposed voyager 2s 
grand tour 24 years ago as an intern at the jet propulsion 
laboratory in california is returning there thursday to view the 
flight past neptune 
gary flandro now a professor of mechanical engineering at the 
university of utah was a graduate student at the california 
institute of technology in 1965 when he calculated flight paths for 
interplanetary space probes 
those projections became a central part of the eventual flight 
paths and launch dates used by voyager 1 and voyager 2 which were 
launched in the 1970s 
flandro found that by using the gravitational fields of the 
planets to redirect the spacecraft and slingshot it toward the 
next planet the speed and distance traveled by the probes could be 
dramatically increased 
at the time it was thought that if you needed to get to 
neptune it would be a 40year flight time he said using 
rocket motors to gain that kind of energy is very costly 
the gravityboost idea isnt new he said the early 
astronomers knew that a comets energy changes dramatically when it 
passes close to a planet 
flandro will be a guest at the pasadena laboratory thursday as 
former coworkers and friends celebrate and watch voyager 2 on tv 
screens as it comes within 3000 miles of neptune the craft already 
has passed by jupiter saturn and uranus 
after leaving neptune voyager will continue into deep space 
relaying pictures and information until its nuclearpowered 
generator runs out of fuel in about three decades 
i found that in the early 1980s all of the outer planets would 
be on the same side of the sun and aligned so that a space vehicle 
could efficiently visit each one he said this alignment only 
happens every 170 years 
he gave his idea the name it still uses the grand tour 
concept 
i did get it started and did the initial selling to nasa but 
its really the jet propulsion labs engineers that made it work 
he said 
voyager 2 has traveled nearly 45 billion miles since it was 
launched by the national aeronautics and space administration in 
1977 using a launch date that almost exactly matched the one 
flandro had calculated 12 years earlier 
he said jupiter by far the largest planet in the solar system 
was the key to the grand tour plan because of its huge 
gravitational field 
many of his caltech colleagues doubted him when he first proposed 
the idea because it was thought that any energy a spacecraft gains 
as it approaches a planet it would give up as it leaves 
the exchange of energy takes place at various times during both 
the spacecrafts approach and departure flandro said but voyager 
will have substantially more kinetic energy when it leaves than when 
it arrived 
the energy is not free he said jupiter loses a little bit 
of its energy as the spacecraft speeds up but jupiter is so large 
that it doesnt make much difference 
still he said there was a group of people who organized a 
protest against the initial plan because they thought jupiter would 
fall out of its orbit they called themselves the pasadena society 
for the preservation of jupiters orbit but i guess no one took 
them seriously

the man who had been dubbed a viable suspect 
in the green river killings was out of town when the series of 
murders of prostitutes began authorities said 
an investigator said monday that a task force had confirmed an 
alibi offered by william jay stevens ii apparently clearing the 
onetime law student of at least the first four of the 40 or more 
serial murders linked to the mysterious killer 
king county police capt robert evans head of the task force 
said stevens was apparently vacationing on the east coast during 
july 1982 when the first victims were killed his comments were 
reported in todays editions of the seattle times and were confirmed 
by his spokesperson cecil ray 
hes still considered a person of interest he is not being 
dropped ray said today 
stevens family called a news conference in spokane last week and 
produced credit card receipts and photographs to document a family 
vacation they said proved stevens was not in the seattle area when 
the first murders occurred 
police have attributed the killings of 40 young women in the 
seattle and portland ore areas to one or more killers the women 
disappeared during 1982 through 1984 
the case takes its name from the south king county river where 
the first victims were found police say at least 40 and possibly as 
many as 48 murders are involved in the nations worst unsolved 
serial murder case 
evans said the investigation of stevens would continue 
this means we appear to have verified one piece of the 
equation evans said we will continue our work until were 
satisfied he has no involvement in any unsolved crimes in king 
county 
stevens a former gonzaga law school student is serving time in 
the king county jail in seattle for a 1981 escape from work release 
after a conviction for possessing stolen property he is scheduled 
for release sept 25 
he was identified as a viable suspect in an affidavit used 
last month to obtain a search warrant of two spokane residences 
where he lived that search yielded 1800 videotapes police 
uniforms and extensive credit card records 
since the search investigators have referred to stevens as a 
person of interest 
stevens has not been arrested or charged in connection with the 
green river killkngs he issued a statement through his attorney 
denying his involvement

mission 
we found original mission plaster alamo curator steve beck 
said there is graffiti in which the dates 1894 and 1897 are 
written in pencil and the name mills is inscribed into the surface 
the name is about 4 inches long and 1 inches tall 
the name may have been carved by william mills of tennessee who 
was among the 189 men known to have died march 6 1836 defending 
the alamo in the struggle for texas independence 
we dont have any solid proof it was william mills but its a 
good possibility beck said 
beck and stone mason baltazar espinosa discovered the graffiti as

officials of the department of health and human 
services said tuesday that dr gail r wilensky a health policy 
analyst who has advised congress on medical issues is the top 
candidate to head the medicare and medicaid health care programs 
the white house is considering wilensky who has the backing of 
hhs secretary louis w sullivan and could formally announce her 
nomination soon if she clears background checks said the officials 
who requested anonymity 
wilensky said tuesday that she is undergoing a background check 
by the fbi if president bush nominates her she said senate 
confirmation hearings could be held in late october or early 
november 
if approved wilensky would become chief of the health care 
financing administration which oversees the 130 billion medicare 
and medicaid programs medicare provides health care for the elderly 
while medicaid helps finance medical services for the poor 
wilensky 46 is a vice president of project hope a foundation 
in chevy chase md that trains medical workers and provides 
emergency care in poor nations and analyzes health issues in this 
country and abroad 
in a telephone interview she declined to discuss her views on 
several topics such as whether federal assistance for abortions 
should be limited she said it would be premature for her to 
make policy statements 
but she said she believes her views would not anger conservative 
republicans in the administration or in congress who have blocked 
prior wouldbe appointees favored by sullivan 
as best as i can tell and ive asked around to try to get a 
sense there is not any opposition to my nomination said 
wilensky a republican 
she advised the house ways and means committee last year when 
congress extended medicare to cover the costs of lengthy serious 
illnesses of the elderly several senior citizen groups have 
complained that the program is too expensive and lawmakers are now 
considering rolling it back 
she has provided advice to congress on problems of the elderly 
and of people without medical insurance escalating health care 
costs and other issues 
wilensky who has a doctorate in economics from the university of 
michigan said she has published about 60 studies on medical issues 
one of them was a 1982 report that concluded that the government 
spends as much on health care for the poor as for the welltodo 
when tax breaks for health insurance and medical payments are 
factored in 
wilensky would be the third person chosen for the job since the 
bush administration took office 
sheila burke chief of staff to senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan withdrew from consideration in april her husband is vice 
president of the aetna insurance group which handles medicare 
claims under contract to hhs sources said there were fears of a 
potential conflict of interest 
last month drew altman new jersey human services commissioner 
decided not to seek the job after drawing opposition from 
conservative republicans 
in june sullivans selection of robert fulton to head the family 
support administration which oversees the welfare program was 
withdrawn after conservatives expressed opposition

the bodies of rep mickey leland and 
eight other americans were flown home in flagdraped coffins 
tuesday two weeks after they died in a plane crash while on a 
humanitarian mission 
the coffins were loaded onto a c141 transport after a twohour 
airport ceremony and left addis ababa shortly after noon officials 
said the aircraft was expected in washington about 315 pm 
wednesday after an overnight stop in frankfurt west germany 
in washington the state department said it planned a memorial 
service wednesday at the lincoln memorial lelands family plans a 
private service in houston 
leland the other americans and seven ethiopians were killed aug 
7 when their chartered plane crashed into a mountain en route to the 
fugnido refugee camp near the sudanese border all 16 aboard are 
believed to have died instantly 
fugnido is one of four camps run by the un high commissioner 
for refugees that house more than 300000 sudanese who fled famine 
and civil war in their country leland a 44yearold texas 
democrat was chairman of the house select committee on hunger 
searchers found the crash site a week later retrieval of the 
bodies from the mountainside and identification took nearly 
another week 
at the memorial service in addis ababa leland was eulogized by 
us un and ethiopian officials as a man of compassion 
the fact that he met his tragic death while on a humanitarian 
mission is ample testimony of his dedication to the wellbeing of 
people said tesfaye woldeselassie ethiopias interior minister 
work at the aiport stopped and employees joined ethiopian 
officials us embassy staff and relatives of ethiopian victims for 
the ceremony the ethiopians wailed in grief and sympathy 
albertalain peters representative in addis ababa of the un 
refugee agency said leland had died for a noble cause it was 
the congressmans fifth visit to africa and his second this year 
the sky was clear for tuesdays ceremony a contrast to the rain 
and heavy overcast of the day lelands party took off for the camp 
the bad weather is believed to have had a role in the crash 
a guard of honor accompanied the coffins of all 16 victims and a 
military band played solemn music as they were moved from the 
makeshift clinic where the bodies were identified 
when the ceremony was over the band played the two national 
anthems the coffins of the americans were taken to the aircraft 
and those of the ethiopians to hearses 
the other americans killed were 
patrice johnson 35 a leland aide 
hugh a johnson 34 of the house select committee on hunger 
ivan lee tillem 33 a new york city lawyer and friend of 
leland who was investigating prospects for foodrelief projects he

huey newton whose black panthers preached 
the power of the gun in a war against white authority in 
america was found fatally shot in an oakland street early today 
police reported 
newton 47 whose violent career was marked by many clashes with 
the law and who spent time as a fugitive in cuba was found about 
530 am said police officer terry foley 
a 10footround pool of blood marked the spot in a lowincome 
neighborhood of west oakland where newton was found suffering from 
multiple gunshot wounds including at least one shot in the head 
police got a report of gunshots fired at 529 am and arrived a 
minute later said sgt dan marcado he said newton was taken to 
highland hospital where he was pronounced dead at 612 am 
marcado declined to say whether there were any suspects or 
reveal any further details surrounding the fatal shooting 
i saw him laying down on the street i called my wife to the 
window said a resident of the neighborhood roy johnson he said 
he did not hear any gunshots and did not call the police 
another resident who asked not to be identified said he 
huey hadnt been down here in years this is where he used to 
organize this is really his old stomping grounds 
newton and bobby seale founded the black panthers the 
nowdefunct radical black liberation group in the 1960s in reaction 
to police brutality in oakland newton served as its defense 
minister 
panthers walked the streets in black berets and black leather 
jackets to protect black people from the authorities they 
reviled as pigs 
bobby rush a former leader of the panthers who is now an 
alderman in chicago said the huey that i remember was a student 
of the world and made a commitment to change the conditions in the 
world 
he made a contribution to the advancement of the ideals of 
freedom justice and equality for all americans said rush who 
left the panthers nearly 20 years ago 
but tom orloff deputy district attorney for alameda county who 
prosecuted newton in 1974 called him a man who lived by violence 
and outside the law and nothing but a gangster 
a black panther party poster distributed nationally during the 
organizations heyday pictured newton on an african wicker throne 
bearing a shotgun and a spear 
in california the state senate subcommittee on unamerican 
activities said in august 1970 that the black panthers were 
controlled by the communist party of the united states to serve as 
shock troops on the front line of the revolution 
thenfbi chief j edgar hoover described the panthers as a 
black extremist organization consisting mostly of hoodlumtype 
revolutionaries who stockpiled weapons espoused marxistleninist 
doctrines and terrorized black communities 
newton in turn once commented in an associated press interview 
the most dangerous groups to the people of the world are the 
pentagon including the cia the us military the local police 
the avaricious businessmen and the lying politicians all are guilty 
of crimes against the people and the verdict is death 
nine years ago he donned a cap and gown to receive a doctor of 
philosophy degree at age 38 from the university of california at 
santa cruz his dissertation was titled war against the panthers 
a study of repression in america but his life was marked by 
repeated clashes with the law 
he was convicted of manslaughter for the shooting death of an 
oakland policeman on oct 28 1967 and was sentenced to 2 to 15 
years but that conviction was overturned on appeal after he served 
two years in prison the charge was dropped after two retrials ended 
in hung juries 
newton convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1964 was 
convicted of being a felon in possession of weapons after a 1974 
incident in which he allegedly pistolwhipped his tailor and police 
found two guns in his apartment 
he then fled the country and lived for three years in cuba he 
was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with the incident 
tom orloff deputy district attorney for alameda county who 
prosecuted newton in the 1974 case called him a man who lived by 
violence and outside the law and nothing but a gangster 
earlier this year newton drew six months in jail after pleading 
no contest to misappropriating 15000 in public money earmarked for 
a school the panthers ran in the early 1980s he was already in jail 
at the time for parole violation 
the panthers eventually died out because of infighting arrests 
deaths imprisonments and differing philosophies especially between 
newton and eldridge cleaver the onetime panther information 
minister and author of soul on ice who fled the country for 
several years in the 1960s after a shootout between panthers and 
police

communist party general secretary karoly 
grosz a centrist who has lost ground recently to reformists 
suggested in an interview published tuesday that he will step down 
to prevent a power struggle 
grosz did not specifically say he would resign but the official 
mti news agency reported that he did not contradict a reporter for 
the party daily nepszabadsag who asked why he intended to leave 
the political scene 
many people want to believe that the main cause of the current 
problems is the power struggle within the party grosz was quoted 
as saying i would not like to have a power struggle as it would 
not do any good to either the party or the country 
he did not elaborate either on his political future or his views 
on the party conflict but he apparently was alluding to 
expectations that an extraordinary party congress oct 6 would be 
dominated by a battle between reformers and their opponents 
grosz became general secretary of the party 15 months ago 
replacing janos kadar the leader of 32 years who had become 
associated with political and economic stagnation 
grosz assumed power amid expectations he would head reforms while 
maintaining discipline and good terms with party conservatives but 
he was left behind as reformers forced the pace of political and 
economic liberalization 
in the past two years the surge of reformist sentiment within 
the party has led to the endorsement of a multiparty system and of 
free elections by mid1990 at the latest 
a draft manifesto published in nepszabadsag on friday ahead of 
the special party congress scheduled for oct 6 reiterated the 
communists intention to introduce a multiparty system in which 
the source of power is the will of the people manifested in free 
elections 
the reformers formally consolidated strength in june when three 
of them were appointed to share power with grosz 
the shakeup placed reform economist rezsoe nyers in the new post 
of party chairman a position he has described as first among 
equals 
grosz had been a scheduled speaker at a party rally honoring st 
stephen the 11th century king who founded the hungarian nation but 
he was absent 
party official pal ivany said at the rally that grosz was 
planning to resign grosz already told the independent daily mai nap 
in june he planned to step down after the elections but he told 
nepszabadsag it was up to the party to decide whether he would step 
down

baltic residents tuesday mourned the 
loss of their independence a halfcentury ago as an international 
crime that must be swept aside by a tide of reform and they 
vilified hitler and stalin as monsters of the 20th century 
about 50000 people gathered in vilnius the capital of 
lithuania on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a treaty between 
adolf hitlers germany and josef stalins soviet union that brought 
soviet tanks rolling into lithuania latvia and estonia 
baltic residents plan to mark the anniversary of the 1939 
agreement on wednesday with a human chain stretching 370 miles from 
tallinn estonia on the gulf of finland to the polishlithuanian 
border activists predict 15 million people will join it 
a lithuanian legislative commission in a report published tuesday 
declared that the realization of the illegal germansoviet 
agreements of 193941 constitute an international crime 
grassroots activists issued a statement in riga latvia demanding 
the absorption of the republics be recognized both inside the soviet 
union and internationally as an act of aggression 
commemoration of the anniversary in the baltics as well as other 
regions such as the western ukraine and moldavia illustrated the 
kremlins dilemna dealing with ethnic minorities clamoring for 
greater freedom soviets now more than ever are free to criticize 
stalin but an official finding that annexation of the baltics was 
illegal would raise the question of total independence 
showing the power that independence movements have accumulated in 
the baltic governments the commission of the lithuanian supreme 
soviet declared that approving annexation was beyond the powers of 
the lithuanian parliament of the time and absolutely against the 
will of the citizens of lithuania 
the report will be forwarded to the full supreme soviet in 
lithuania and a spokesman for sajudis the peoples front 
organization of lithuania said it may eventually form the basis for 
a republicwide referendum on future relations with the soviet union 
a representative of a russian cultural organization in vilnius 
told the rally that hitler and stalin two monsters of the 20th 
century personally ruined the fate of millions of people 
vytautas landsbergis leader of the lithuanian sajudis or 
peoples front movement told the vilnius rally that annulment of 
the pact is not only a historic and political question but a moral 
one of the liquidation of stalinism 
landsbergis spoke as several dozen yellow red and green 
lithuanian national flags fluttered youths climbed light towers to 
get a better view of the stage and children were hoisted on their 
parents shoulders 
after the soviets seized control thousands of baltic residents 
were shot or deported for their antisoviet sympathies after the 
war others were similarly punished for real or alleged 
collaboration with the nazis 
baltic residents increasingly have come to equate the actions of 
stalin and hitler who divided eastern europe into spheres of 
influence on the eve of hitlers attack on poland the started world 
war ii posters in the vilnius crowd showed a skull and crossbones 
imposed over the soviet and nazi flags 
the official soviet media struggled against that impression in 
two reports from tallinn criticizing a new monument to an estonian 
pronazi group and cards showing a hammer and sickle and swastika 
together 
recalling the soviet struggle to turn back hitlers invasion the 
national daily socialist industry said no one has the right to 
spit on our graves 
in a statement released at a conference of east european 
activists in riga leaders of the grassroots peoples front 
organizations of the baltic republics said that in the years since 
it annexed them the soviet union has done everything to remove 
the republics of estonia latvia and lithuania from the memory and 
the map of europe from your libraries and textbooks your sense of 
justice your grief and your minds 
let us unite our voices to demand that the hitlerstalin pacts 
together with their secret protocols be declared null and void from 
the very moment of their signing let us declare the annexation of 
estonia latvia and lithuania unlawful it said 
a twoday conference of eastern european activists that wrapped 
up tuesday in riga called for an end to the occupation of the 
baltic states and asked european countries to seek un action 
declaring it an act of aggression 
the soviet union for decades denied the existence of a secret 
protocol to the aug 23 1939 nonaggression treaty that divided 
eastern europe into spheres of influence 
a commission of the congress of peoples deputies national 
parliament in moscow is investigating the pact and has said it 
should be declared null and void but it stopped short of 
criticizing the incorporation of the thenindependent baltic states 
into the soviet union 
communist party politburo member alexander n yakovlev in an 
interview with the party newspaper pravda said last week there was 
there was no connection between the division of eastern europe and 
the incorporation of the baltic republics 
yakovlev is a close adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev and 
the partys chief ideologist he also is chairman of the national 
commission on the stalinhitler agreement

a federal judge on tuesday ordered disbarred 
attorney william borders to jail for refusing to answer questions 
from a senate panel gathering evidence in the alcee l hastings 
impeachment trial 
us district judge thomas pennfield jackson found borders in 
contempt of court and gave him until 10 am friday to put his 
affairs in order and surrender to federal marshals 
jackson acted hours after borders refused for the third time in a 
month to answer questions posed by the hastings impeachment 
committee 
the committee is gathering evidence concerning charges that 
hastings a 52yearold us district judge from florida conspired 
with borders to obtain a 150000 payoff and lied about it before a 
jury that acquitted him in 1983 
hastings who was impeached by the house in august 1988 is also 
accused of improperly disclosing information that government 
investigators obtained through a courtapproved wiretap 
once the committee finishes its report the full senate will vote 
on whether to remove hastings from the federal bench and thus take 
away the 89500 annual salary he continues to collect 
while hastings was acquitted by a federal court jury borders was 
convicted of the payoff conspiracy charges in 1982 he was 
disbarred sent to prison for 33 months and shorn of the political 
influence officials say he wielded in the washington of the late 
1970s 
at the request of the senate jackson held borders in civil 
contempt of court for refusing to testify after being granted 
immunity from prosecution for anything concerning the payoff plot 
that he might say in the proceeding 
this court confines him to the custody of the us marshal 
until he purges himself jackson said 
jackson said borders could win his release whenever he wished 
simply by answering questions from the committee if he remains 
silent however he will remain behind bars until the senate votes 
on whether to remove hastings from the bench most likely before 
midoctober 
borders on tuesday refused to answer 10 questions posed by sen 
arlen specter rpa they ranged from whether hastings received any 
payoff money to the reported relationship between borders and the 
late florida mafia boss santo trafficante 
in reply to each of the questions borders cited a statement he 
read to the panel july 27 when he had remained similarly silent in 
it he refused to answer questions on grounds that they violated his 
constitutional rights including his 5th amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
borders was arrested in october 1981 when he drove out of a 
suburban virginia motel with a garment bag containing 125000 in 
cash and accompanied by a retired fbi agent masquerading as a 
convicted racketeer in quest of leniency from hastings

israeli troops fatally shot a palestinian woman 
tuesday in the gaza strip and two other arabs were reported killed 
in the west bank raising to six the number of palestinian deaths in 
the past two days 
also tuesday a group of prominent palestinians met with israeli 
legislators in the occupied gaza strip despite warnings from 
underground leaders of the uprising not to do so 
the rash of fatalities in the occupied lands prompted commercial 
strikes in arab east jerusalem as well as in the palestinian towns 
of ramallah to the north and bethlehem to the south 
palestinian school officials said the army told them the violence 
also would delay the reopening of classes for high school sophomores 
and juniors teachers earlier were told the classes would resume 
wednesday 
west bank schools were closed for most of the uprising but have 
been reopened in phases since july 
in the occupied gaza strip 20yearold maha awad abu hadath was 
killed by a stray shot when a clash erupted between soldiers and 
masked stonethrowing youths in the market of the deir elbalah 
refugee camp arab witnesses said 
doctors at ahli arab hospital in gaza city said she was hit in 
the head by a rubbercoated metal pellet that troops use for riot 
control 
a military spokeswoman confirmed the death and said the army was 
investigating the two other reported deaths 
in the west bank 14yearold najla aadel elnadi died of a 
bullet wound to the head suffered during a stonethrowing 
confrontation with soldiers a week ago in the askar refugee camp 
near nablus according to doctors at ramallah hospital 
in the west banks alamari refugee camp arab reporters said the 
body of nasser khalil shahin abu katrina 17 was found tuesday with 
a bullet wound in his chest 
residents said troops opened fire during clashes in the camp 
monday night but the army spokesmans office said it could not 
confirm if there was any shooting 
reporters were banned from entering the camp because of a curfew 
confining residents to their homes 
the deaths raised to at least 545 the number of palestinians 
killed since the palestinian uprising against israeli rule began in 
december 1987 thirtyeight israelis also have died in the violence 
palestinians have killed 97 fellow arabs many suspected of 
collaborating with israeli authorities 
the death in alamari camp was the second mysterious killing in 
the area north of jerusalem in a week 
on friday the body of a palestinianamerican boy was found near 
elbireh adjacent to ramallah he had been shot at close range in 
the chest 
the family alleged that the boy 14yearold amjad jibril tawil 
born in denver was in army custody before his death and that the 
body showed signs of beating and torture 
the army exhumed tawils body for an autopsy and announced monday 
that his death was not caused by israeli security forces it did 
not say who killed him 
dr derick pounder a scottish pathologist brought in by the 
tawil family to conduct an independent autopsy said tuesday he was 
unable to do so immediately because of bureaucratic problems 
with israeli authorities 
in gaza palestinians met with lawmakers from the leftleaning 
labor party and the leftist citizens rights movement 
labor member amir peretz told israel radio that some gazans 
scheduled to attend the meeting stayed away apparently because of 
unwillingness to meet with israelis in the ruling parties 
this meeting is not considered disobedience of the orders of 
the united national leadership of the uprising gaza lawyer 
mohammed abu shaaban told reporters we met with people that have 
no authority 
the latest leaflet from the underground leadership last week 
warned that palestinians should reject meetings with any israeli 
official or unofficial 
peretz told israel radio that the meeting was part of ongoing 
efforts to discuss human rights problems in the territories and to 
review options for advancing the governments peace plan 
the plan calls for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip to choose local palestinians to negotiate with israel on 
limited autonomy for the territories

voyager 2s encounter with neptune caps a 
string of successes for an aging but still nimble spacecraft that 
was supposed to have been abandoned years ago 
voyager 2 was launched on aug 20 1977 on a fiveyear mission 
to explore two new worlds jupiter and saturn 
nasa scientists knew however that if the spacecraft held out it 
could theoretically go on to uranus and neptune which were in 
precisely the right alignment that happens only once every 175 
years 
twelve years after its launch voyager 2 is almost 3 billion 
miles from earth and about to pass 3000 miles from neptune its 
closest approach to any object in the solar system since leaving 
earth 
voyager 1 launched sept 5 1977 passed jupiter and saturn on a 
course that then took it out of the solar system 
the two voyager spacecraft encountered jupiter in 1979 the 
biggest surprise was the discovery of at least nine active volcanoes 
on jupiters moon io eruptions spewed material up to 190 miles 
above the moons surface 
a thin ring was discovered around jupiter and the identification 
of three new moons brought jupiters total to at least 16 
the two spacecraft passed saturn in 1980 and 1981 saturns 
rings which had seemed simple and distinct from earth were 
revealed to be a nearly continuous layer of complex rings one was 
delicately braided from three strands of material 
wind on saturn was observed at staggering speeds of up to 1100 
mph 
saturn was known before the encounters to have 11 moons it is 
now known to have at least 17 
as voyager 2 continued alone to uranus it discovered that the 
planet had a strange magnetic field with a corkscrewshaped tail 
extending millions of miles into space 
uranuss moon miranda was shown to have been dramatically 
fractured by internal forces a finding that researchers have still 
not explained ten new moons were found bringing the total to 15 
voyager found two new rings around uranus in addition to the 
nine previously known a high layer of smog was found over the south 
pole which was in direct sunlight 
voyager 1 and voyager 2 took more than 100000 pictures of 
jupiter and saturn and voyager 2 sent back 7000 pictures from 
uranus

three tapes recorded by the beatles were snubbed by 
bidders tuesday although john lennons sunglasses and a pair of 
high heels worn by marilyn monroe in some like it hot fetched 
higherthanexpected prices 
two other tapes in which the fab four sang and read from the 
bible were sold for about 18700 to a private german buyer who bid 
by telephone 
the auctioneer sothebys had set minimum prices of 16000 each 
for two of the unsold tapes and a minimum of 24000 for the third 
the disappointed owner of the tapes former beatles chauffeur 
alf bicknell said he may put them back in the tool shed where they 
were kept since 1966 
we were expecting about 50000 pounds 80000 more coming 
from the beatles tapes said sothebys spokeswoman susu elliot 
ms elliot said the auction house was required to read a 
statement from the beatles record company emi before the tapes 
were auctioned that warned buyers they would not be able to 
broadcast or sell copies 
perhaps that put people off she said 
bicknell the beatles chauffeur from 196466 said lennon gave 
him the reeltoreel tapes in 1966 thinking they had been sent by 
fans 
the tapes had been in bicknells tool shed in wales until last 
year when in the course of writing a book about the beatles he 
listened to them and found that the group had made the tapes on a 
portable machine 
bicknell 60 sat out the sale at a nearby pub because he was too 
nervous to watch 
he said he was selling the tapes because he has had some lean 
years while writing the book baby you can drive my car 
coauthored by gerry marsden of gerry and the pacemakers another 
liverpool band 
a puerto rican collector who gave his name only as lawrence 
paid 8800 for the 4inch black ferragamo heels worn by miss 
monroe in some like it hot 
paul trees from northern england successfully bid 3000 for 
elton johns black jacket 
i would have paid 2750 pounds 4400 said the director of 
a nursing home company who sports an eightinch tattoo of elton 
johns single saturday nights alright for fighting cover on his 
right arm 
lennons sunglasses sold for 3500

items the gallery held a mixed crowd of heavy metal fans with 
shaved heads wearing all black 1960s survivors in bright patterns 
and the conservative coiffed crowd which frequents bond st where 
sothebys is located 
the auction netted 364000 compared with 1987s rock 
memorabilia sale that brought in 360000 last year sothebys held 
an elton john sale instead of the rock n roll memorabilia sale 
which made 8 million

a navy report on the blast aboard the uss iowa 
that claimed 47 lives will not pinpoint a specific reason for the 
explosion but will cite a probability about its cause defense 
sources say 
one defense official said investigators have attempted to look at 
all the circumstances that may have led to the explosion but that 
none appears to have been the overriding reason for the disaster 
the official said he was told the report will show a number of 
lapses in procedures but he declined to define them 
specifically 
asked about reports that such problems as lapses in preventative 
maintenance of the gun turret had been uncovered or that some of 
the sailors had not been properly certified to operate the ships 
complex firing mechanism the official said 
the investigation found various things wrong about procedures 
but none of them has been found to be the cause 
the report cites a probability said the official who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity 
the longawaited report said to fill three feet of a file 
drawer is under study by the staff of the chief of naval 
operations adm carlisle a h trost at the pentagon 
trost is expected to brief navy secretary h lawrence garrett and 
defense secretary dick cheney before he releases it to the public 
both officials are traveling and will not return to the pentagon 
until next week 
navy investigators have worked for months to find the cause of 
the april 19 tragedy when powder exploded in the battleships no 2 
gun turret during open seas gunnery practice near puerto rico 
although pentagon spokesman pete williams has said the report is 
expected to be made public at the end of august or the beginning of 
september it now appears that a september release appears more 
likely the pentagon source said 
theyre poring over everything with a magnifying glass the 
official said in any investigation of this magnitude they have 
to look at everything 
another pentagon official familiar with the type of study that 
has been undertaken said it is very difficult to find a specific 
reason when so many have been killed who might have offered a clue 
to the blast 
there were 11 survivors inside the turret which extended six 
decks down into the ship the survivors were all on the lowest deck 
loading power from the ships magazines at the time of the blast 
besides delving into the mechanical problems that could have 
caused the blast it researches the possibility that human action 
may have been the reason for the explosion 
the washington post reported in tuesdays editions that the 
investigation has found the crew failed to perform certain 
unspecified preventive maintenance procedures but the newspaper 
added it is not known whether the faulty maintenance caused the 
explosion 
the post reported the no 2 turrets guns passed prefiring 
checks before the explosion 
in a separate story the daily press of newport news va 
reported that the sailors who worked with the explosives in the 
turret had not been properly cleared to man their posts 
the navy requires that all who work at certain posts be certified 
by a qualifying board which determines whether they are able to 
handle weapons or other procedures 
michael drowns one of 11 sailors who escaped the explosion told 
the daily press a qualification board was never convened on the iowa 
during his three years on the ship 
another iowa survivor gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt 
has said one of the sailors who lacked a qualification book showing 
facts about the guns was gunners mate 3rd class robert w 
backherms the rammerman of the center gun where the explosion 
occurred 
truitt said backherms joined the ship shortly after christmas 
was inexperienced and may have caused the blasts by ramming the bags 
of explosives into the gun too fast

mazzone said quigley who lived in bethlehem pa has no family in 
the united states no job and only has a vistors visa

ireland 
quigley asked mazzone to release him

intention of staying here and fighting these charges i can give you 
my word of honor that no matter what conditions you lay down i will 
abide by them 
quigleys attorney richard bachman argued the only reason 
quigley was being held without bail was because he is irish

because he is a citizen of a foreign country 
assistant us attorney richard stearns opposed bail 
the judge told bachman he would reconsider bail if he was

an escalating sinhalese uprising took 
at least 61 more lives and the government arrested 100 suspected 
radicals officials and independent sources said tuesday 
at least 18 bodies were found monday in the central village of 
mahawehera where ethnic sinhalese radicals ambushed a military 
convoy the previous day said sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the bodies were dumped in a roadside ditch formed by buried 
explosives that were detonated under the passing convoy the sources 
said the attack killed at least six soldiers and a civilian driver 
the sources said the bodies were of suspected radicals killed by 
government forces in revenge for sundays attack they said the 
suspects had been shot 
government officials said they knew of no retaliatory violence in 
mahawehera 85 miles northeast of the capital of colombo 
however senior government officials have in the past 
acknowledged privately that members of the security forces sometimes 
commit abuses in trying to halt the radicals campaign of killing 
and terror 
at least 10 other bodies were found near the village of 
atturugiriya 15 miles northeast of colombo said police officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
there were no details on how the victims died the bodies were 
burned and could not be identified police said 
human rights groups have blamed most of such killings on 
government forces and progovernment vigilante groups that support 
the official campaign to put down the uprising 
in other violence reported since monday at least 11 radicals and 
two policemen were killed in three separate shootouts in the 
sinhalesedominated south and center of the island military sources 
said

suspected sinhalese radicals were arrested during the same period 
at least 4000 people have been killed in the sinhalese campaign 
launched in july 1987 to protest government peace overtures to 
rebels from the minority ethnic tamil community 
the radicals say a peace plan aimed at ending the rebellion gave 
too many concessions to the tamils they also say the deployment of 
indian soldiers in the tamildominated north and east to enforce the 
plan compromises sri lankas sovereignty 
military officials also said 20 relatives of soldiers and police 
officers were killed monday and tuesday by sinhalese radicals 
the killings are follow threats against relatives of those 
soldiers and police officers who refuse to heed a call from the 
radicals to resign the deadline for the ultimatum expired sunday 
said the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
at least 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
been killed since tamils launched their separatist war in 1983

majority 
tamils who are mostly hindu form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people the buddhist sinhalese make up 75 percent of the 
population

the rebound in us feed grain production this 
year will help lower feed costs and stimulate use an agriculture 
department report said tuesday 
total output of feed grains corn sorghum barley and oats 
for 1989 was estimated at 2176 million metric tons based on aug 1 
production estimates announced earlier this month 
that is up 46 percent from last years droughtreduced harvest of 
1492 million tons part of the increase is due to a 14 percent 
boost in harvested acreage 
but total feed use in 198990 is expected to be about 226 million 
tons up 5 million tons from the 198889 forecast domestic feeding 
is forecast to increase by almost 9 million tons but exports may 
drop because of greater foreign competition 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn the department uses metric tons to measure overall feed 
supplies and use and bushels when referring to specific grains 
with use likely to exceed production us stocks in 198990 
may drop more than a tenth the report said however prices are 
also expected to decline because of lower loan rates and reduced 
drought psychology in the market 
world production of coarse grains such as corn is projected at 
800 million tons up 10 percent from 198889 the report said that 
includes us output 
while total foreign production may be nearly unchanged 
significant increases are expected in the major competing exporters 
except for the european economic community and south africa it 
said a tightening in the world coarse grain supplyuse situation 
appears likely in 198990 
the report said world feed grains consumption is expected to 
increase in 198990 exceeding production for the third straight 
year 
in a related government report the joint agricultural weather 
facility said its weekly survey for aug 1420 showed that the 
nations corn crop was in good to fair condition and that 68 
percent of the acreage was in the dough stage of kernel development 
or beyond 
an estimated 26 percent of the corn was in the final dent stage 
of kernel development 
both the dough and dent stages are lagging the usual pace for 
corn development in most of the major production states the report 
said 
the facility which is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments reports on weather and crop conditions during the 
season the agriculture department will issue the next production 
estimate on sept 12

heritage usa the booming resort that grew 
from jim bakkers fundraising talents hangs on in the shadow of 
its glory days before the tv evangelist resigned and was indicted 
on fraud and conspiracy charges 
the heritage grand hotel and the sprawling water park remain 
open they are bordered by the halffinished spectres of a 20story 
hotel and the fiberglass turrets and towers of a hamburger castle 
theres no longer enough traffic to wear down the grass that pops 
through the concrete of the massive parking lot at the water park a 
giant crane looms over the unfinished hotel shadowing the shops of 
main street usa heritages indoor shopping mall 
used to be you couldnt even get a seat in here said ken 
daneilson of turlock calif as he watched a handful of shoppers 
drift along main street whenever a service would let out or 
something else was going on you could forget about getting into the 
ice cream shop over there 
bakker envisioned heritage usa as a retreat for christians that 
would feature family entertainment and religious services 
now its owned by a canadian developer and bakker goes on trial 
monday prosecutors say he and other ptl executives used at least 4 
million of the 158 million they raised through lifetime 
partnerships in the ministry to pay for their own luxurious 
lifestyles 
danielson was one of those who donated at least 1000 to bakker 
for a partnership in 1984 in exchange for three nights lodging a 
year at heritage usa for the rest of his life several hotels were 
proposed but the heritage grand hotel was the only one finished and 
opened 
danielson soon switched his partnership from the uncompleted 
towers to the heritage grand hotel the switch meant he got to use 
his partnership unlike many others 
i felt like i got my moneys worth out of it said danielson 
i switched that first year and then came at least two more years 
with rooms running 90 or 100 a night it worked out about even 
danielson said he had not been to heritage usa in a couple of 
years and he could immediately see a difference 
all the limousines are gone from the front of the hotel he 
said they used to be all over the place out here every day wed 
see jim bakker pull in with his limousine and chauffeur 
the bakkers likenesses are virtually absent from the shops along 
main street a small table in the victor music shoppe held books 
written by jim and his wife tammy faye which were once used as 
premiums for faithful contributors tuesday they were on sale at 75 
percent off the retail price 
records by tammy faye and her daughter tammy sue chapman were 
selling for as little as 98 cents 
manuel cantu sr who owns a snack bar on main street saw the 
end of ptls heyday i got this just two weeks before it all 
started to unravel cantu said referring to bakkers resignation 
in march 1987 its been kind of tough 
cantu said the former owners who also operated the ice cream 
shop and popcorn stand did 10000 worth of business on a fourth of 
july four or five years ago 
ten thousand dollars in a single day can you believe it 
asked cantu who lives on the heritage usa grounds and also works as 
an evangelist helping refugees from central america 
thats how busy it used to be around here he said there 
were so many people you could hardly move 
now its ok on weekends but hardly anybody during the week 
he said theres a healing conference going on this week so you 
have maybe 40 50 60 people here for that thats helped pick it up 
a little but its not like it was 
and i honestly doubt if it ever will be again

an investigation leading to kidnap 
conspiracy charges against two virginia men began after one 
contacted an undercover police officer through a computer message 
system asking about young boys for a pornographic snuff film an 
fbi affidavit says 
the affidavit filed as part of the case quoted one of the men 
as saying his main interest was in killing the child 
it quoted daniel t depew 28 of alexandria as saying i want 
to strangle the kid i want to hang the kid i want to suffocate the 
kid 
depew and dean a lambey 34 of richmond were arrested aug 14 
after a sixmonth investigation by the fbi and the san jose calif 
police department 
the investigation began in february when a california police 
officer in his investigative work listed himself in a computer 
bulletin board system designed to assist people seeking 
contact with others interested in diverse sexual pursuits the 
papers said 
over the course of numerous contacts lambey told the undercover 
officer he was interested in making a sexually explicit movie with 
children according to the affidavit filed in richmond 
during one telephone conversation with his police officer 
contact the affidavit said lambey said i think the pleasure of 
doin it would be worth it 
according to the affidavit at a july 21 meeting at a hotel near 
dulles international airport depew said he would accept a boy as 
young as 12 but 13 or 14 is more along my lines 
more than 100 fbi agents were involved in the investigation us 
attorney henry hudson said tuesday fbi agents from richmond and 
washington followed them 24 hours a day to make sure no child or 
citizen was placed in danger the prosecutor said 
hudson urged parents to keep track of their children there 
are as this case illustrates people out there who choose to prey 
on children 
authorities said that under the scheme they are alleging the men 
had in mind a child would abducted or purchased the fbi affidavit 
quoted lambey as saying he knew someone in florida who would sell a 
child for 12000 he said 5000 of that amount would be returned 
if the child were returned according to the affidavit 
during one conversation with agents depew said he had previously 
attempted to molest and kill an american teenager in greece and a 
boy from washington dc who looked about 15 the affidavit 
said 
both men are charged with conspiracy to kidnap and were being 
held tuesday pending grand jury action

he was the picture of revolutionary chic a spear in one hand a 
gun in the other a black beret posed jauntily on his afroblown 
hair and he on his throne a wingbacked wicker patio chair 
he was huey p newton black panther cofounder black panther 
minister of defense excon expatriate 
hes dead now like so many others who bought the credo he 
adopted from mao tsetung political power grows out of the barrel 
of a gun newtons bulletriddled body was found in a pool of 
blood in a poor oakland calif neighborhood early tuesday 
during the late 1960s and early 70s the black panthers put 
pig in the national lexicon and shocked a naive and nonviolent 
generation into the chilling realities of racial warfare 
they prowled urban streets in shiny black shoes and black leather 
jackets insolent berets and starched blue shirts tucked neatly into 
pressed black slacks their weapons were shotguns law books and 
tape recorders 
they were out to protect the community only the panthers werent 
on the lookout for muggers rapists and robbers they were scoping 
cops their selfproclaimed mandate was to prevent police brutality 
against ghetto blacks who were sometimes beaten during arrests and 
whose civil rights were at times violated 
the panthers created an image of defiance and organized 
resistance to police forces that did not take into consideration the 
rights and basic human dignities of the black community bobby 
rush onetime panther deputy minister of defense and former leader 
of the chicago chapter said in a 1983 interview with the associated 
press 
a lot of the reform in police departments across the country 
today is directly related to the heated controversy of panthers vs 
police 
rush now a chicago alderman called it a controversy others 
called it a war including j edgar hoover then director of the 
fbi hoover called the panthers the most violenceprone of all the 
extremist groups 
hoovers secret war was devastating to the panther organization 
the fbi launched a secret campaign involving fake documents and 
letters infiltrators and informants which was disclosed by a 
senate investigating committee in 1976 it was part of hoovers 
cointelpro operation in the 60s and 70s to disrupt and discredit 
civil rights and antiwar organizations 
in 1969 black panthers mark clark and fred hampton were killed 
in a predawn police raid at their chicago headquarters police had 
ostenstibly been searching for weapons 
clark and hamptons relatives and other survivors of the raid 
successfully sued city state and federal officials and were awarded 
185 million in 1983 
bobby seale who helped newton create the panthers in 1966 once 
told the ap that law officers killed 26 panthers and that the 
panthers dispatched their share of police and fbi agents 
they wounded 60odd of us we wounded 32 of them i think the 
reason we killed less and wounded less was because they had more 
equipment said seale who today writes cookbooks and cooks 
barbecue and has a cameo appearance in the movie rude awakening 
initially the panthers were nonviolent they appeared at the 
scene of an arrest merely to observe the police the police resented 
their presence and the nonviolent panther patrols soon led to 
altercations and eventually shootouts 
eldridge cleaver the former panther minister of information and 
author of soul on ice was charged with assaulting a police 
officer in an oakland calif gunbattle in 1968 he jumped his 
50000 bail and fled to algeria 
he returned in 1975 saying he had a religious conversion he 
pleaded guilty to the charges was given probation and ordered to do 
2000 hours of community service 
newton was released from prison in 1970 after serving almost 
three years for the 1967 murder of an oakland police officer the 
verdict was later overturned because of errors by the trial judge 
he also was twice tried for the 1974 slaying of a young prostitute 
the charges were dropped after both trials ended in hung juries 
newton went into selfexile in cuba shortly thereafter he 
returned to the united states in 1977 
the panthers said seale never became economically 
selfsufficient by creating their own businesses and investments 
instead they relied on donations from white liberal organizations 
and individuals which began to dwindle in the 70s 
the panthers were good at raising money from the captains of 
industry and culture such as those who attended that party at 
lennys the park avenue fundraising bash given by 
composerconductor leonard bernstein in 1970 guests included 
filmmaker otto preminger and socialite cynthia phipps the take for 
the panthers was 10000 
if business wont give us full employment then we must take 
the means of production and put them in the hands of the people 
said donald cox a panther field marshal who spoke at the 
fundraiser 
i dig absolutely said bernstein 
the fbis counterintelligence program also helped to shatter the 
panthers 
seale and other former panthers who eventually wound up in 
washington congressional offices civil service jobs and corporate 
positions contend that fbi infiltrators posing as panthers 
committed robberies and incited shootouts to help undermine the 
organization 
the panthers had a purge dropping hundreds of members they 
thought might be undercover agents 
but what the fbi counterintelligence program also did seale 
said was to stop black organizations from merging 
panther rhetoric and the fear it caused also smothered the 
organization 
seales unsuccessful campaign for oakland mayor in 1973 dealt a 
major blow to panther ranks members from chapters around the 
country had been called to california to help in the campaign 
disillusioned when he lost they quit the party 
the meager remnants of the black panthers huddled together in 
oakland with newton in cuba party leadership fell to elaine brown 
who ran for city council in 1973 and 1975 finishing second both 
times 
under her leadership the panthers instituted a number of 
community activities such as shopping assistance for the elderly a 
community school for ghetto youngsters child care and student lunch 
programs the school program was closed in 1982 amid allegations 
that federal and state grants were misused 
today the panthers prowl no more 
but they left an important legacy seale said one thing it did 
is that it let the ku klux klan and other overt racist organizations 
know that if these young blacks had the audacity to shoot it out 
with the police then those groups had a hard way to go

a federal judge denied the national wildlife 
federations request tuesday that shrimp fishermen be required to 
equip their nets with devices designed to protect endangered sea 
turtles from drowning 
wildlife federation attorney robert irvin said he would appeal 
the decision by us district court judge stanley harris to the us 
court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the federation had asked the court to require the commerce 
department to enforce regulations requiring shrimpers to equip their 
nets with turtle excluder devices or teds 
five conservation groups meanwhile filed suit against commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher alleging his actions on behalf of 
shimpers have virtually assured the drowning of thousands of 
endangered sea turtles 
in a lawsuit filed late monday in federal court here the 
organizations claim mosbacher acted unlawfully when he suspended 
regulations that require shrimpers to use teds which prevent sea 
turtles from becoming ensnarled in their nets and drowning 
the lawsuit also seeks to force mosbacher to resume enforcement 
of the suspended regulations on teds 
mosbacher suspended teds regulations after shrimpers angry about 
having to use the devices which they claim reduce their catch by as 
much as onethird blockaded shipping channels along the texas gulf 
coast 
under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in a 
separate lawsuit by the wildlife federation mosbacher then ordered 
shrimpers who dont use teds to limit their trawling times to 105 
minutes at prescribed intervals 
michael j bean an attorney for the environmental defense fund 
said there has been no sign that gulf coast shrimpers are 
complying with the limited trawl times 
commerce spokesman brian gorman said the department is waiting 
for the courts to make a judgment about the appropriateness of our 
course of action but declined to comment further because the 
matter is in litigation 
according to the lawsuit mosbachers decision suspending the 
teds regulations and replacing them with ineffective inadequate 
interim regulations is causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs and

first lady barbara bush was ordered onto new 
medication tuesday after her doctors concluded there has been no 
improvement in a bothersome eye condition triggered by graves 
disease her spokeswoman said 
however press secretary anna maria perez said the specialists 
who examined mrs bush during a twohour session at walter reed army 
hospital also agreed that the diseases most serious threat an 
attack upon her thyroid gland has been controlled 
mrs bush 64 interrupted her maine vacation with the president 
to have the condition reevaluated because of continuing problems 
with the irritating side effects involving her eyesight including 
tearing and occasional double vision her doctors prescribed 
prednisone a mild form of the steroid drug cortisone in an attempt 
to stem the irritation ms perez said 
the first ladys press office issued this formal statement 
in the scheduled visit today to walter reed army hospital in 
washington mrs bushs graves disease was again evaluated by her 
physicians dr burton lee dr kenneth berman and dr frank 
lapiana in consultation with other specialists from the mayo 
clinic walter reed and george washington university 
the thyroid function is under control but the eye 
manifestation of the disease which has included double vision 
tearing and irritation has not improved for that reason mrs bush 
will begin a daily treatment of prednisone a form of cortisone her 
condition will be monitored over the next several months to 
determine whether further treatment is necessary 
prednisone a steroid hydrocarbon often is used in the treatment 
of inflammatory conditions including arthritis and allegic 
disorders it is regarded as having fewer side effects than 
cortisone 
mrs bush did not talk with reporters during the hospital visit 
she left immediately afterward for nearby andrews air force base in 
maryland and a flight back to kennebunkport on an air force 
executive jet 
she was in fine spirits ms perez said she said she

kennebunkport she said she was helping millie on the book 
millie is the first familys dog mrs bush coauthored a 
childrens book with an earlier bush hound c fred several years 
ago 
she thanked the doctors for taking the time out of their 
schedule said ms perez she quoted the first lady as saying 
im not going to stay long 
earlier this year mrs bush was treated with radioactive iodine 
to render her thyroid gland inactive and has since taken other 
medication maintain adequate hormone levels thyroid secretions 
regulate body growth and metabolism 
graves disease results from a mixup in the bodys 
diseasefighting immune system the body produces antibodies that 
mistakenly attack the thyroid gland as an enemy instead of harming 
the gland they stimulate it to grow and work nonstop producing 
too much thyroid hormone though the tendency is passed from parent 
to child no one knows precisely what triggers the antibody attack 
left untreated graves disease can be life threatening but it 
generally responds to therapy

the panamanian embassy in washington which has 
been under the control of forces opposed to gen manuel antonio 
noriega will be closed next week until democracy is restored to 
panama it was announced tuesday 
ambassador juan b sosa who has used the embassy as an 
antinoriega headquarters for the past 18 months made the 
disclosure in a telephone interview on the eve of an organization of 
american states foreign ministers meeting on panama 
sosa was appointed ambassador to washington by thenpresident 
eric arturo delvalle two years ago delvalle was deposed by 
noriegas allies in february 1988 but the united states continues to 
regard him as the legitimate authority in panama 
it also has continued to recognize sosa as panamas official 
envoy 
sosa said he has decided to close the embassy on aug 31 because 
sept 1 is the date on which delvalles term was scheduled to expire 
we have always maintained we are fighting for a constitutional 
principle sosa said adding he and his family are vacating the 
embassy and will move to an apartment in washington he intends to 
continue his struggle against noriega he said 
sosa said state department officials have informed him they 
concur with his decision to close the embassy 
panamanian president manuel solis palma attempted to replace sosa 
last year but the envoy with us goverment support refused to 
relinquish control of the embassy 
sosa has had partial access to panamanian government funds in the 
united states which were frozen by the reagan administration to 
prevent noriega from having access to them sosa has used the funds 
to keep the embassy functioning 
sosa said he held little hope that an oas mediating team set up 
three months ago will be able to fulfill its mandate of achieving a 
democratic transfer of power in panama 
the crisis arose in panama last may when amid widespread 
allegations of fraud panamanian authorities threw out the results 
of the countrys national elections independent observers said the 
antinoriega candidate guillermo endara appeared to have won by a 
large margin 
the oas mediators were due to return to washington tuesday night 
and will present their report to the oas foreign ministers on 
wednesday 
us officials asking not to be identified said it appear 
likely noriega will arrange for solis palma a noriega loyalist to 
be replaced by an equally reliable successor on sept 1 noriega 
would retain behindthescenes control of panamas political life 
this would fall short of the bush administrations objectives for 
panama 
weve supported the oas mission state department deputy 
spokesman richard boucher said tuesday 
weve supported the mandate they have to achieve a transfer of 
power weve stated very clearly that for that to occur noriega must 
go weve stated very clearly our policy that there will be no 
accommodation with the noriega regime he said

permitted level of dust in mines as part of a general overhauling of 
workplace air quality standards 
the proposal would require operators to implement new 
requirements for medical evaluation and transfer of miners exposed 
to certain carcinogens a summary of the proposal said 
the proposal would reduce the permitted amount of dust in the 
air avberaged over an eighthour shift from 10 milligrams per 
cubic meter 13 cubic yards or 35 cubic feet measured as 
nonquartz dust to 5 milligrams of all breatheable dust not covered 
by a separate substance standard 
the proposed new standard would cover more situations the agency 
said 
the separate standard for coal mines 2 milligrams per cubic 
meter the agency said 
among other things the new standard for asbestos would be 
200000 fibers per cubic meter instead of 2 million fibers this

a proposed government plan for determining 
damages from the exxon oil spill released tuesday called for 
environmental studies to be completed by next february a time 
critics said was too short 
the plan drawn up by the interior department is a broad outline 
of procedures to be used in the assessment process that eventually 
will determine how much the exxon corp will have to pay to restore 
alaskas environment including longterm damages to wildlife and 
other natural resources 
a group of government trustees who are charged under federal law 
to make the longterm damage assessment asked that interested 
parties comment on the broad outline by the end of september before 
it becomes final 
the 258page proposed plan makes no damage assessments nor does 
it set a dollar value on possible damages 
however the report directs that all environmental studies that 
are to be used in determining damage should be completed over the 
next six months no further studies will be conducted after feb 
28 1990 the document says 
if any additional studies are to be conducted after february they 
may be only at the recommendation of the government trustee council 
and scientific and legal review groups as being necessary to 
promote restoration and to support assessment of legally recoverable 
natural resource damages the document said 
the short timetable brought almost immediate criticism from some 
environmental groups who claim that significant damages from the 
spill last march off southern alaska will not be known for years in 
fact cleanup efforts are not even likely to be completed by then 
resulting in cases where oil may still be causing new damages the 
critics maintained 
this plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm to 
the environment and a limited recovery of damages from exxon 
maintained sarah chasis an attorney for the natural resources 
defense council the first years damages will tell only part of 
the story 
ms chasis said there also is concern that the plan does not make 
clear the role of the exxon corp in the assessment plan exxon 
executives have said they want to participate in the determination 
of damages to wildlife and natural resources as a result of the 
march 24 spill that dumped 11 million gallons of oil into pristine 
prince william sound 
the proposed assessment plan said a decision on whether to allow 
exxon to participate and if so to what extent has yet to be made 
bob walker an interior department spokesman acknowleged that 
there had been discussions on whether to allow longer studies of 
environmental damages before moving ahead to making actual damage 
assessments according to other sources who asked not to be 
identified some participants argued that in some cases as long as 
five years may be needed to determine damages to certain wildlife 
the trustees wanted to get to restoration as fast as possible 
and not take a leisurely approach to studying whatever needs to be 
studied said walker 
he said the timetable is not necessarily final and objections can 
be raised by intrested parties during the comment period 
some of the studies to be completed by february already are under 
way said walker

the government tuesday accused turkey of 
hyprocrisy for its decision requiring that ethnic turks immigrating 
from bulgaria first obtain visas 
turkish border officials said they had strict orders beginning 
tuesday to turn away the refugees waiting to cross into turkey 
however the semiofficial turkish news agency anatolia said 522 
were allowed to cross without visas anyway 
the refugees say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign 
in bulgaria 
the turkish government announced its move monday saying it would 
require the visas because bulgarias communist leaders have refused 
to start talks on an accord to protect the emigrants turkish 
officials said the new requirement would give them more control over 
the influx 
however turkish opposition parties accused the government of 
backing away from its pledge to accept all ethnic turks who want to 
come 
turkeys ambassador to sofia was summoned to the foreign ministry 
on monday to hear bulgarian complaints about the exceedingly harsh 
predicament of thousands of bulgarian turks en route to turkey 
the official bulgarian bta news agency said 
the turkish governments decision to close its border to 
bulgarian citizens proves the hypocrisy and the instigation of the 
turkish mass media and officials who used to claim that unobstructed 
admission will be secured for all muslim bulgarians bta quoted 
the communist party daily newspaper rabotnichesko delo as saying 
this decision debunked a myth which has been persistently 
propagated by the stage managers of the antibulgarian propaganda 
that turkey is the mother country the real homeland of moslem 
bulgarians the newspaper said 
bulgaria blames turkey for refusing to hold talks on reaching an 
immigration agreement bta said 
about 310000 bulgarian turks have flooded into turkey in the 
past three months they say the assimilation campaign begun in 
1984 has prevented them from using their turkish names speaking 
turkish or practicing islamic rites 
about 15 million ethnic turks live in bulgaria 
turkey says an immigration accord should stipulate that those who 
leave be compensated for property left behind and accumulated social 
security it also says families should be kept together 
turkish officials say ethnic turks can now obtain visas from 
turkeys consulates at burgas and sofia in bulgaria 
anatolia said turkish authorities tried to turn back the refugees 
who crossed at the kapuikule border post tuesday without visas 
however some of the refugees tried to jump from the windows of the 
train they were in and officials agreed to let the group cross the 
agency said 
in istanbul turkey members of a us congressional delegation 
criticized bulgaria 
senators dennis deconcini dariz and frank r lautenberg 
dnj and rep bob mcewen rohio said they interviewed ethnic 
turks in bulgaria who were waiting near the border on monday to go 
to turkey 
it was painfully obvious that the bulgarian government had 
forced by its policies of discrimination against turks in bulgaria 
hundreds of thousands of men women and children out of their homes 
with only the possessions they can carry deconcini told a news 
conference tuesday in istanbul 
the americans are members of the congressional helsinki 
commission which monitors the helsinki accords on human rights 
signed by 35 nations in 1975

staterun media on tuesday blamed 
foreigners visiting under the guise of tourists for stirring up 
protests by thousands on the 21st anniversary of the 1968 sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
authorities said 370 people including 50 foreigners were 
arrested 
by tuesday night no word emerged on the fate of hungarians 
poles and italians arrested when hundreds of helmeted riot police 
wielding truncheons broke up crowds demanding freedom and withdrawal 
of soviet troops who crushed the prague spring reforms 21 years 
ago 
hungarian consul lajos taba said his embassy received telephone 
calls indicating nine hungarians were detained polish press attache 
kzrysztof opalski said he heard on state radio that three poles were 
held but that the czechoslovak foreign ministry had given his 
embassy no official word on detentions 
extra police remained on patrol tuesday in pragues central 
wenceslas square checking the papers of bystanders and western 
journalists a folk group and brass band played on the spot where 
mondays protests erupted 
prague radio asserted that 1000 italians and 3000 polish 
solidarity activists had come to the capital under what it termed 
tourism in disguise to stir up the demonstrations 
the provocation was brought about by those who traveled under 
the guise of tourism said a similar commentary on tv they came 
here to give us advice nobody likes this and we czechoslovaks are 
no exception 
the commentaries were an apparent attempt by czechoslovakias 
entrenched leadership to ignore domestic pressure for reform and 
depict such pressure as the work of outsiders 
in a dispatch from prague polands official pap news agency 
challenged czechoslovak media reports 
it is worth stressing that there is no proof that poles and 
solidarity representatives took part in the disturbances in downtown 
prague pap said 
it said the polish embassy was unable to obtain the identities of 
any poles detained and sent a note to the foreign ministry seeking 
information so it can get in touch with them and explain their 
legal position 
in rome italys foreign ministry summoned czechoslovakias 
charge daffaires to complain that the detention of the italians was 
unjustified and the behavior of czechoslovak authorities was 
in clear contradiction with the new climate of faith and openness 
characterizing eastwest relations 
the italian news agency ansa quoting ministry sources said 
eight italians were arrested in prague 
czechoslovak authorities and media had campaigned for weeks prior 
to the anniversary against independent groups and warned that force 
would be used to break up protests 
police have cracked down hard on independent activists in recent 
weeks harassing several and cutting their telephones charter 77 
spokeswoman dana nemcova said tuesday that dozens of people were put 
in preventive detention over the weekend 
some of those were free tuesday but others were still 
unaccounted for said nemcova who with her activist son david was 
under house arrest from early sunday until late monday night 
many other leading activists were warned to stay out of prague 
and other big cities some including prominent human rights 
campaigner vaclav havel appealed against street protests fearing 
bloodshed 
several of the 370 people the communist party daily rude pravo 
said were detained monday were beaten by police but the newspaper 
said no one was seriously hurt 
police attacks on western journalists drew strong criticism 
abroad 
austrian foreign minister alois mock condemned what he termed the 
aggressive behavior of the police who detained two austrian 
cameramen sliced their camera cable with a knife and struck one of 
the crew 
italy protested the rough handling of two italian journalists 
who the italian television channel rai due said were punched by 
plainclothes men and had their cameras damaged 
a west german tv crew also was detained briefly monday in what 
appeared to be an attempt by police to limit footage shown on 
western tv stations that can be received in czechoslovakia and to

an east german was shot to death in a 
struggle with hungarian border guards officials said tuesday 
intensifying a diplomatic crisis caused by thousands of east germans 
fleeing their rigid communist regime 
chancellor helmut kohl repeated an offer to meet with east german 
leader erich honecker on the refugee problem but said only reforms 
would halt the flow 
west germany said it was closing its embassy in prague 
czechoslovakia to refugees because it was overwhelmed by east 
german refugees government sources said more than 100 east germans 
had packed the embassy to demand emigration help 
bonn closed its embassy in budapest and its mission in east 
berlin this month because of the crush of east germans trying to get 
to west germany 
about 200 east germans fled across the hungarianaustrian border 
tuesday in the second mass flight in four days border guards and 
police said in vienna bringing the total of east germans arriving 
in austria on tuesday to about 500 
the hungarian news agency mti reported the first death resulting 
from the wave of escapes 
it said kurtwerner schulz was shot about 30 feet inside austria 
monday night while trying to cross the border with his wife and 
6yearold daughter mti described the shooting monday as an 
accident it said the wife and child were unhurt and were in 
hungarian custody adding that the family failed in an earlier 
bordercrossing attempt 
hungary began dismantling its barbedwire barrier with austria in 
may until the schulz incident no serious injuries were reported in 
the illegal exodus but hundreds were caught and detained for short 
periods 
east berlin authorities can take years to process applications 
for legal emigration and often reject specialists and younger 
workers because of the nations widespread labor shortage 
travel visas to hungary are relatively easy for east germans to 
obtain and some of the estimated 200000 traveling in hungary this 
month have taken their chances with what appeared to be a new escape 
route to the west 
bonns foreign ministry said of the schulz case that it 
disturbed over the death of a fellow german it demanded a 
detailed explanation and hungarian assurances that armed force would 
not be used to halt east german escapees 
the rate of escapes and emigration to west germany this year is 
the largest migration from east germany since the berlin wall was 
built in 1961 and may exceed 100000 by the end of the year 
more than 65000 east germans have arrived in west germany in 
1989 including more than 2000 who escaped illegally in recent 
weeks by sneaking through recently relaxed borders between hungary 
and austria 
refugees flooding the main west german transit camp in giessen 
have said they left after losing hope that honeckers leadership 
would ever ease restrictions on travel emigration and expression 
the latest mass escape took place tuesday evening near 
klingenbach austrian customs officers said they said buses would 
take the 200 east germans to the west german embassy in vienna 
which is providing hotel accommodation for newly arriving east 
germans 
earlier tuesday about 300 east germans crossed into austria from 
hungary at various border points hours after schulz was shot 
a mass escape of east germans took place saturday when 661 people 
walked into austria after a border barrier normally closed was 
opened for an international picnic 
the shooting occurred near lutzmannsburg about 15 miles south of 
sopron western hungary 
mti said schulz knocked a guard down with his bag and kicked him 
in the head after two border patrols fired warning shots and ordered 
the family to stop the fray took the participants into austrian 
territory it said 
the agency said schulz tried to seize the guards gun and it went 
off fatally wounding schulz 
he died while guards were taking him back to hungary for medical 
aid mti and the austrian interior ministry reported 
most of the 171 east germans in the west german embassy in 
budapest are people caught in escape attempts despite east german 
assurances they wont be punished if they return voluntarily they 
refuse to leave 
under the west german constitution east germans are entitled to 
immediate citizenship in west germany 
east german authorities have told bonn relations could suffer if 
west germanys embassies in budapest east berlin prague and warsaw 
continue to shelter the refugees 
we dont want a confrontation kohl said but he made clear 
that changes must be made within east germany to halt the escape 
trend 
kohl dismissed east berlins contention the escape spree is the 
result of western enticement 
the pressure for change is not coming from the west but from 
poland and the soviet union and hungary kohl said applauding the 
reform movement sweeping those countries

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev made 
clear tuesday that poland cannot solve its problems without the 
communist party a party spokesman said 
gorbachev who leads the soviet unions communist party spoke 
for 40 minutes by telephone with mieczyslaw f rakowski head of 
polands communist party said party spokesman jan bisztyga 
gorbachev expressed confidence that the polish party would 
successfully solve the social and economic problems in the interest 
of socialism and voiced the conviction that solving these problems 
is impossible without the communist party bisztyga said 
polands communist party is pressing for maximum representation 
in the new cabinet 
the conversation came as tadeusz mazowiecki the solidarity prime 
ministerdesignate held talks on forming the east blocs first 
government led by noncommunists 
mazowiecki met with leaders of polands political factions and 
said he hopes to form his government within a week 
the parliament vote to confirm his nomination as prime minister 
was postponed from wednesday to thursday to allow further 
consultations said sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz 
although there are enough votes for mazowieckis election even 
without support from the communist party the prime 
ministerdesignate faces the delicate task of balancing competing 
interests in the new alliance 
mazowiecki met jan janowski the floor leader of the democratic 
party outgoing prime minister czeslaw kiszczak and marian 
orzechowski the parliamentary leader of the communist party 
the long oneonone meeting with kiszczak at an undisclosed 
location was serious and interesting mazowiecki said afterward 
at the offices of the solidarity weekly he edits 
later at the national assembly mazowiecki said he had a very 
intensive conversation about problems which interest us with 
orzechowski he also met with the speakers of the sejm and senate 
the two chambers of the national assembly 
the distribution of portfolios and the name of future ministers 
are the capitals most soughtafter secret and the competition for 
them among parties apparently is intense 
mazowiecki has so far given no details of his intentions saying 
only that he wants the broadest possible coalition of proreform 
forces from every party 
however the communist party was promised the defense and 
interior ministries controlling the army and police as part of 
solidarity leader lech walesas agreement with president wojciech 
jaruzelski who is allowing solidarity to take charge of the first 
noncommunist government in eastern europe in more than 40 years 
the communist party in a central committee resolution sunday 
demanded more than those two ministries and has said it wants to be 
treated as a full governing partner the two minor parties that 
joined a coalition with solidarity are also pressing for the maximum 
number of seats 
are there enough portfolios the opposition newspaper gazeta 
wyborcza asked in an ironic headline 
there are 19 government ministries or government leve offices 
but the number could be expanded or reduced for instance 
solidarity has discussed creating a ministry for national minorities 
according to the newspaper the united peasant party wants five 
ministries plus a deputy premiership 
the democrats want three to four ministries and one deputy prime 
minister janowski said in a statement issued by pap the democrats 
favor the principle of avoiding a decisive domination of any of 
the forces participating in the government he said 
the communist party has said it must have enough ministries to 
correspond to its political and state potential but has not 
said what that number is orzechowski declined to comment on his 
partys demands after meeting mazowiecki 
the partys top body the politburo met tuesday to consider its 
stance on the government the communist party is ready to take up 
coresponsibility determined by the responsibilities which are 
created for it according to a statement carried by pap 
tensions emerged between the communist party and its former 
coalition partners as the democrats and peasants issued statements 
critical of an aug 19 central committee resolution that said a 
solidarityled government would be destabilizing 
as mazowiecki a longtime adviser to walesa began steps to 
assemble a government there were signs of anxiety about the future 
of a noncommunist government 
the opposition newspaper carries a frontpage cartoon showing a 
wall with graffiti saying the summer is yours the zomo riot 
police are ours 
a war of words continued between the communist party and walesa 
with the party daily criticizing the union leaders statement monday 
in which he warned the party to abandon threats and blackmail 
it is a pity there are only generalities in walesas 
statement it would be worthwhile to point out the parts of the 
central committee stands which are threats and blackmail the 
editorial said 
these are sharp words which should not be used by either of the 
two main political forces in poland that is solidarity or the 
party the editorial said 
it said the party is only being reasonable when it says it will 
withhold support from the mazowiecki government until it learns its 
program it said the party cannot agree that solidarity has common 
and unlimited support in poland

a former secretary for exattorney 
general charlie brown was indicted tuesday on charges she extorted 
money from brown to keep quiet about a pregnancy he allegedly was 
responsible for 
the indictment came one day after brown abruptly quit rather than 
face a grand jury investigation 
the indictment charged brenda k simon of columbus ohio with 
one count of extortion and one count of obtaining money under false 
pretenses 
in addition her attorneys dropped a 3 million libel suit filed 
aug 11 against the charleston gazette citing the criminal 
investigation 
the gazette had reported that simon 35 who worked for the 
attorney general in 1985 and 1986 demanded 50000 from brown to 
keep quiet about getting pregnant by him and having an abortion in 
1986 
both brown and simon denied the allegations when they were made 
by the gazette simon said she had a baby girl in july 1986 but the 
child died the next day she said the father was kenneth dale 
thaxton her husband 
the indictment said she obtained at least 200 from brown which 
is the legal minimum to bring the felony charge said kanawha county 
prosecutor bill forbes the indictment said brown had appeared 
before the grand jury that indicted simon 
forbes said the state had reports that simon obtained 7500 to 
50000 from brown from january to december 1986 
she signed a note saying she had an abortion forbes said 
asked if brown was the father of the child forbes said 
obviously he thought so 
if convicted of extortion simon faces up to five years in 
prison forbes said the false pretenses charge carries a maximum 
penalty of 10 years and a 500 fine on conviction 
brown a democrat resigned monday in return the kanawha county 
prosecutors office dismissed the grand jury probe into allegations 
that brown lied under oath and grew to include his campaign 
financial records 
gov gaston caperton will name a successor to brown 
lawyers for simon filed a notice tuesday in ohio county circuit 
court asking for the dismissal of the lawsuit against the gazette 
according to her lawyers simons testimony in her civil suit would 
compromise her in the criminal investigation 
crady swisher an attorney for simon declined comment on the 
indictment and dropping of the lawsuit thaxton reached at the 
couples home in columbus ohio said his wife would have no comment 
brown 39 whose brother is secretary of state of ohio read a 
statement to reporters tuesday morning saying he was stepping down 
from the post to shield his 5yearold daughter from continuing 
publicity about the case he declined to answer questions 
brown said he did not lie during sworn statements at a child 
support hearing in may when he corrected himself after misspeaking 
at one point in questioning the questions allegedly dealt with 
simon and the funds the gazette said 
browns financial records from 1984 and 1988 were subpoenaed as 
part of the grand jury investigation but forbes declined to say 
what they were looking for he said the case is closed 
brown first elected in 1984 and reelected in 1988 was found 
innocent in 1986 on eight state misdemeanor counts of soliciting his 
staff for campaign contributions 
he is the second top state official to resign this year 
extreasurer a james manchin quit july 9 rather than face an

attorney general dick thornburgh on tuesday 
announced the top 12 alleged colombian drug traffickers the justice 
department wants extradited and said the united states should not 
bow to fears that it might become the target of the violence that 
has plagued colombia 
whatever consequences ensue from our enforcing the law are part 
of the risk that we assume in a society that depends upon the rule 
of law thornburgh said during a sidewalk news conference 
we cant succumb in this country to what has already brought 
the criminal justice system to its knees in colombia he said 
they are rising from their knees they are standing up to these 
drug traffickers and they deserve every bit of support that we can 
give them and that support will be forthcoming 
the dozen most wanted list includes the leadership of the 
medellin and cali cocaine cartels but not the one alleged medellin 
moneylaunderer who has been arrested in colombia eduardo martinez 
romero 
however thornburgh said we are taking steps to provide the 
necessary documentation to secure his extradition to the united 
states 
a colombian official said in bogota that the first moves toward 
extraditing martinez had already been made 
in all about 80 alleged colombian drug traffickers are under 
indictment in the united states but their cases have languished 
since the colombian supreme court overturned its extradition treaty 
with the united states in 1987 the department said 
colombian president virgilio barco instituted emergency measures 
over the weekend to allow the immediate resumption of extraditions 
his action was triggered by the assassination friday of luis carlos 
galan a leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the 
drug traffickers 
colombian drug gangs assassinated more than 50 magistrates and 
judges in recent years and had almost terrorized all other civil 
and military authorities into acquiescence to their operations 
thornburgh praised the colombian governments crackdown that has 
resulted in the arrests of some 11000 people 
we are very grateful for the kind of courage that has been 
displayed by the colombians thornburgh said the efforts he 
said can lead to better cooperation in securing criminal 
convictions of these very prominent figures in the drug cartels 
included in the list of the top 12 are reputed medellin cartel 
leaders pablo emilio escobar gaviria 39 jorge luis ochoa vasquez 
40 and jose gonzalo rodriguez gacha 42 
also on the list are 
two of ochoa vasquezs brothers fabio 32 and juan david 41 
along with gustavo de jesus gaviria rivero 42 and gerardo moncada 
42 all are allegedly members of the medellin cartel 
jose ivan duarte acero 37 a former policeman who allegedly 
works with the medellin cartel he is the gunman who was 
responsible for the attempted murder of two of our agents down 
there said drug enforcement administration spokesman con 
dougherty 
the reputed leaders of the cali cartel gilberto jose rodriguez 
orjuela 50 miguel angel rodriguez orjuela 45 and jose santacruz 
londono 45 also on the list is alleged cali cartel member jamie 
raul orjuela caballero 46 
facing trial in the united states is what these drug lords fear 
the most thornburgh had said earlier in a statement this list 
of a dozen priority offenders is only the first phase of our 
extradition efforts our review of those whom we seek for trial is 
ongoing and the list is likely to be supplemented in the near 
future 
thornburgh said during the news conference that in addition to 
supplying the names to the colombians the names have also been put 
on the interpol network to encourage international efforts to find 
those that may have fled colombia because of the crackdown 
we dont know the whereabouts of any of these individuals he 
said 
asked what the colombians need the most to fight the drug 
cartels thornburgh said the enormous appetite for drugs must be 
curbed 
every cocaine sniffer and crack smoker in this country 
contributes to the violence and the enormous profits that are reaped 
by the colombian drug traffickers he said 
the drug enforcement administration said the complete list of 
people whose extradition may be sought numbers from 50 to 100 the 
justice department is reviewing that list to determine which 
extraditions should be sought if the targets are arrested

a bogota newspaper reports there may have 
been an arab connection in the assassination of sen luis carlos 
galan it was the latest suggestion foreign mercenaries are involved 
in colombias drugrelated bloodshed 
earlier accounts in the news media have said there were 
indications british israeli and south african mercenaries were 
training assassination teams for the drug cartels 
galan the nations leading presidential candidate was shot on 
friday at a political rally the killing prompted an emergency 
declaration by authorities and a crackdown on the powerful drug 
cartels 
according to the conservative bogota newspaper el siglo police 
are investigating what appears to be an arab link to galans murder 
it quoted an unidentified witness on monday as saying that just 
before the killing the man who shot galan was heard speaking to an 
accomplice in a foreign language and the killer left behind at the 
scene a copy of the egyptian newspaper al ahram 
el siglo carried a photograph of the newspaper dated june 3 
1989 
police said the drug cartel based in the industrial city of 
medellin the world center for cocaine trafficking had offered 1 
million for galans assassination an attempt to kill him on aug 4 
was frustrated by authorities 
military and police authorities also say the drug cartels are 
using some of their billiondollar profits to arm and train squads 
of hired assassins in a loose association with rightwing extremists 
on april 10 local newspapers cited national police documents as 
saying that israeli and british mercenaries were providing training 
to the death squads at camps in a rural northeastern colombia 
shortly after those reports a national television chain broadcast 
a video tape it said was received from the death squads it showed 
men in militarystyle uniforms training with highpowered automatic 
weapons the video included an interview with a purported trainer 
who spoke spanish with a foreign accent and kept his back turned to 
the cameara 
in the united states nbc nightly news on monday showed videotape 
it said was obtained from colombian television of drug assassins 
in training at a secret base camp somewhere in colombia it said 
the video was made available by the cocaine cartel apparently as 
a kind of video warning of what the cartel would do if the 
government moved against it 
the reporter brian ross said colombian and american authorities 
identified some of the trainers shown in the video as israelis and 
south africans former military men now training colombian drug 
armies in assassination and terror techniques 
on aug 13 the sunday times of london reported that british 
mercenaries are being used by a drug cartel based in the city of 
cali that is engaged in a bloody 18monthold feud with the 
medellin cartel 
the newspaper said british mercenaries were hired to kill 
medellin cartel leader pablo escobar by bombing a rural ranch he 
owns from two helicopters it said one helicopter was too weighted 
down with arms and crashed on june 4 and the other turned back 
the paper said that upon learning of the attempt escobar 
launched a similar plot to kill cali cartel boss gilberto rodriguez 
orijuela but mechanical failure forced the escobar helicopter to 
make an emergency landing july 12 
authorities have confirmed accidents involving helicopters on the 
dates cited in the reports in both cases police pilots were 
involved officials said in the july 12 incident authorities 
reported finding 259000 in cash abroad the aircraft 
but officials cast doubt on the report the newspaper reports 
events that really have taken place but it frames them in a novel 
situation that goes beyond qualification said police gen carlos 
casadiego

martinez described by colombian officials as a 35yearold 
economist was indicted in march as part of operation polar cap 
which resulted in charges against 127 people and two latin american 
banks 
hes one of the medellin cartels financial chiefs not the 
biggest one but certainly an important one drug enforcement 
administration spokesman frank shults said tuesday his arrest is 
the arrest of a significant figure in that investigation 
polar cap uncovered a moneylaundering operation that reached 
across the united states into south america and to england with 
direct ties to the medellin drug cartel in colombia justice 
department officials said it laundered an estimated 12 billion 
over two years they said 
martinez was arrested during the weekend in the northern 
department of sucre and colombian national police said they started 
proceedings tuesday to hand martinez over to the united states in a 
test of a new emergency plan for extraditing people alleged to be 
top drug traffickers 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the united states is moving 
to extradite martinez despite the fact that his name was not on a 
list of the dozen most wanted drug traffickers thornburgh sent 
tuesday to the colombian government the list focused on the leaders 
of the medellin and cali cartels 
we are taking steps to provide the necessary documentation to 
secure his extradition to the united states thornburgh said the 
attorney general said martinez is the only individual facing 
indictment in the united states that we know of who has been picked 
up by colombian authorities 
thornburghs chief of staff robert ross said later that it was 
not clear how long the process would take 
the quickest thing that could happen is they could put him on a 
plane and send him to the united states without waiting for any 
additional paperwork ross said 
martinez was among 11000 people arrested in an emergency 
crackdown triggered by fridays assassination of a leading 
presidential candidate who was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo reported monday that martinez 
declared his innocence in statements made while jailed in bogota 
at no time have i had links to the medellin cartel and i dont 
know any of its members he was quoted as saying the newspaper 
said that when arrested he had none of the heavily armed 
bodyguards who usually accompany drug lords 
on march 29 the day the polar cap indictments were announced 
thornburgh told reporters that martinez was holed up in a bank in 
panama surrounded by panamanian defense forces seeking to arrest 
him for us authorities martinez had been scheduled to meet that 
day with undercover agents in panama he said 
however later in the afternoon martinez somehow managed to 
escape from the bank said bruce pagel a trial attorney with the 
justice departments narcotics section 
the panamanian defense forces are headed by gen manuel antonio 
noriega who is under indictment in the united states on federal 
drugtrafficking charges 
martinez is described in the indictment as an associate and agent 
of geraldo moncada whom the us government accused of organizing 
supervising and managing for the medellin cartel the importation 
sale and distribution of cocaine in the united states and in 
particular new york 
according to the indictment issued in atlanta martinez was 
involved mainly with la mina or the mine the name the drug 
world uses for the moneylaundering operation 
martinez directly contracted with la mina and the undercover 
agents of the drug enforcement administration to launder the illegal 
drug proceeds of the cartel the indictment says 
eduardo martinez acted as a broker in negotiating with 
various moneylaundering groups as to their cost and services in 
laundering the cartels drug monies the indictment says 
eduardo martinez paid monies to codefendants william guarin and 
clara garcia to ensure that laundered drug proceeds which had been 
transferred to codefendant banco de occidente were not seized by 
law enforcement authorities 
the banco de occidente sa a panamanian institution pleaded 
guilty earlier this month to laundering more than 400 million in 
drug money through wire transfers that government agents traced to 
the medellin cartel the panama branch agreed to pay a 5 million 
penalty in a plea bargain in which the us government agreed to 
dismiss all charges against the colombian parent company and release 
72 million in frozen assets in north america and europe

a 3ton killer whale died before thousands of 
horrified spectators in a bloody fight with another whale over the 
captive mammals pecking order during a show at sea world officials 
said tuesday 
kandu a 14yearold whale who gave birth to a calf in the same 
tank during a show last year suffered an upper jaw fracture when 
she struck corky an 8000pound female believed to be about 25 on 
monday sea world veterinarians said 
the fracture triggered a massive hemorrhage into kandus nasal 
passages and she bled to death within 45 minutes said veterinarian 
jim mcbain spectators saw the whale spouting blood 
kandu and corky were seen circling the 5 milliongallon tank and 
gathering speed in the moment before the collision which occurred 
in a holding pen next to the show pool area witnesses said 
the two adult whales were coming into the show pen when it 
seemed like they collided said jim barnes of stansbury park 
utah who was at the show 
trainers called kandu to the pools side and her baby 
11monthold baby shamu followed said another spectator stephanie 
hass 
they gave her that little pat signal and she rolled over and 
the little baby rolled over too hass said and the blood came 
out and it was all over the sidewalk and everywhere 
corky escaped the collision with minor rake marks from kandus 
teeth baby shamu and knootka a third adult female killer whale at 
the park were not involved in the collision 
kandu and corky had several skirmishes before the fatal episode 
mcbain said he described the behavior as a ritualized combat 
initiated by the younger kandu to assert her dominance 
kandu was the dominant female mcbain said periodically 
kandu would assert herself so that corky knew that kandu was still 
the superior of the two individuals 
what was not part of the normal scenario was the way she 
impacted because what ended up happening is kandu did fatal 
damage to herself mcbain said 
kandu essentially was battered to death said brian gorman a 
washington dcbased spokesman for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration noaa is the parent agency of the 
national marine fisheries service which is looking into kandus 
death 
gorman said the federal agency received a preliminary report from 
sea world and had no problems with the parks decision to resume 
its popular killer whale shows tuesday 
killer whales and marine mammals in general often fight ram 
chase and nip each other as part of maintaining a social hierarchy 
said ken norris a professor at the university of california santa 
cruz who has studied whales for 35 years 
mcbain said it was best to maintain some semblance of normalcy 
and go on with the shows for the wellbeing of the parks three 
remaining whales the shows have been scaled down and trainers are 
not being allowed in the water for the time being 
all three whales know something is different mcbain said 
the two adults seem to have adjusted to kandus loss but baby shamu 
took it harder 
the baby was showing a little confusion and then acts as if 
shes expecting mom to show up at any time mcbain said she was 
agitated last night but shes much more relaxed now

a 12party opposition coalition would 
return confiscated land and dismantle much of the army if elected in 
februarys scheduled balloting according to a document obtained 
tuesday 
the opposition platform also envisions maintaining state control 
of foreign trade while freeing the domestic market 
members of the national opposition union a loose coalition 
ranging from communists to conservatives debated the plan tuesday 
and the associated press obtained a copy the final version was 
expected to be released later this week 
nicaraguans are scheduled to vote in a general election february 
for the first time since the sandinistas won a civil war and came to 
power 10 years ago the balloting comes under democratic reforms the 
leftist regime promised in exchange for usbacked rebels ending 
their 7yearold war against the sandinistas 
the opposition is expected to announce its candidates for 
president and vice president this week 
the coalition platform covers a broad political range 
it states the intent of the coalitions government of national 
salvation to protect private property and guarantees workers 
right to unionize participate in managing enterprises and share 
profits 
at the same time it promises to advance some measures of the 
sandinista programs such as the literacy campaign while eliminating 
the military draft 
but in trying to please all sides of the coalition the plan 
treads on shaky ground 
one of the strongest cards held by the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front is its commitment to giving land to peasants 
responding to this the coalition document says to the poor and 
middleincome peasants will be guaranteed the legitimate property of 
the land they have in their possession 
but it also says to peasant families who have been 
dispossessed inasmuch as is possible their farm will be returned 
or they will be compensated with another farm 
to the dispossessed of the countryside they will be given 
state land with the right to acquire it for free as their legitimate 
property 
since taking power in 1979 and as recently as june the 
sandinistas have seized land belonging to the late president 
anastasio somoza and his supporters and to private farmers in 
retaliation for political opposition the sandinistas led the revolt 
that ousted somoza in july 1979 the somoza family had ruled 
nicaragua for decades 
the distribution of land to peasants although often resulting in 
a drop in production has garnered the sandinistas popular support 
the 14page document says the country would have a military but 
mentions several times the intent to restructure and drastically 
reduce it according to the countrys economic capacity and social 
needs 
with the war between the sandinistas and rebels known as 
contras over troops on both sides should dedicate themselves to 
study and production the platform said 
the sandinistas army estimated to have 200000 members in a 
country with a population of 35 million is the largest in central 
america and receives 60 percent of the annual national budget 
the most likely opposition candidates for president are violeta 
barrios de chamorro whose family owns the opposition newspaper la 
prensa enrique bolanos geyer a businessman and virgilio godoy of 
the liberal independent party 
president daniel ortega used the opening tuesday of a new relay 
station for the government radio network to appeal to contras based 
in honduras to demobilize 
you can put down your arms accept the peace plan ortega 
said youre not going to be put in jail youre not going to be 
put on trial the nicaraguan people will give you the 
opportunity to rejoin society 
about 11000 rebels and 12000 dependents are in camps in 
honduras the sandinista government says 2500 more are inside 
nicaragua 
ortega said the new transmitting station which relays broadcasts 
from managua will beam reports to the camps in honduras 
he said the station in esteli 93 miles north of managua was 
built with soviet aid 
the contribution from the soviet union is exemplary and should 
be the example the united states follows in its relations with 
latin american countries and in particular nicaragua ortega said

a reputed drug lord facing extradition from 
colombia is among the alleged criminals caught up in operation 
polar cap which has been described as the biggest 
moneylaundering probe in us history 
the multiagency investigation involved more than two years of 
infiltrating and unthreading a tangled web spun from a bogus gold 
shipping and smelting scam tons of drugs hundreds of millions of 
dollars and fast and freewheeling foreign bank deals 
ronald caffrey head of the us drug enforcement 
administrations office here confirmed that eduardo martinez 
romero a 35yearold colombian economist and reputed financial 
wizard behind the medellin drug cartel was a polar cap suspect the 
cartel is believed to be responsible for most cocaine shipments to 
the united states 
romero was among thousands arrested in colombia in recent days in 
a crackdown on drug kingpins that followed the assassination friday 
of a presidential candidate and the slayings earlier that week of a 
judge and a police official romero faces extradition to the united 
states 
papers filed in federal court in atlanta say the moneylaundering 
operation known by its users as la mina the mine laundered 
about 12 billion in drug money between 1987 and february 1989 
operation polar cap investigators uncovered the operation and 
found evidence that led to a guilty plea by banco de occidente of 
panama to charges it laundered drug money the plea was entered 
earlier this month in us district court in atlanta 
banco de occidente of panama forfeited 5 million to the united 
states canada and switzerland similar charges against the banks 
parent institution banco de occidente of cali colombia were 
dismissed as a result of the plea 
a government document filed with the plea said the probe also led 
to the arrest of sergio hochman and raul vivas who apparently set 
up la mina in mid1985 hochman pleaded guilty to moneylaundering 
charges this spring and named vivas and others as accomplices 
la mina involved the money from the drug sales going to vivas and 
hochman who took commissions of up to 12 percent the government 
said 
the owners of the money provided the two with account numbers in 
panama or colombia hochman then would telephone a firm in uruguay 
and order gold equal to the amount of money from the drug sales 
minus the commission 
but the gold that was sent actually was lead covered with enough 
gold to pass a scratch test should one be given 
the gold was taken by courier to the united states to 
refineries owned by the two or to a new york city financial 
operation involved in the money laundering 
the refinery would certify that the gold was real and buy it 
the money was wired back to la mina accounts in uruguay then was 
wired to a panama bank or to blackmarket exchange houses in 
colombia ending up in the bank accounts of drug traffickers 
polar cap investigators infiltrated the moneylaundering network 
by offering an atlanta moneylaundering service 
the us attorneys office in atlanta called polar cap the 
largest narcotic moneylaundering investigation ever conducted by 
us law enforcement agencies 
it involved hundreds of agents and cooperation from canada great 
britain the caribbean island of montserrat switzerland and west 
germany and has resulted in charges against 127 people and two 
foreign banks

a 62yearold woman who was put on 10 years 
probation for killing her husband spoke tuesday of years of broken 
bones and bruises she suffered at his hands 
a ruptured eardrum a separated shoulder and a broken leg were 
part of the pain during their 12year marriage marianne biesenbach 
said on a hellish day in march 1988 her husband max threatened to 
slice her throat with a butcher knife given his violent nature ms 
biesenbach believed him 
she ended the nightmare by fatally shooting him in the driveway 
of their home on march 5 1988 it was something she had tried to do 
at least twice 
a state district judge in san antonio on monday ordered ms 
biesenbach to serve 10 years probation after she pleaded no contest 
to involuntary manslaughter the plea was negotiated by defense 
attorney richard racehorse haynes 
today i dont feel guilty anymore i feel i did what i had to 
do to stay alive ms biesenbach said tuesday in a telephone 
interview from her home in kerrville 70 miles northwest of san 
antonio 
i gave up i didnt care thats why i wouldnt accept even the 
word voluntary manslaughter i didnt plan that i dont know how 
i did it it was through primitive brain self preservation said 
ms biesenbach who has four children and seven grandchildren 
max biesenbach 59 had threatened her as they drove home from 
dinner she said she had hidden a 357caliber magnum revolver in 
their van where she slept occasionally to escape his rage she said 
before he could hurt her again ms biesenbach shot him three 
times in the chest 
the killing followed years of abuse from a husband she described 
as a jekyllandhyde drinker 
when he was sober she said he was as kind as santa claus 
taking his grandson fishing then he would turn violent in private 
often after drinking heavily 
its indescribable the hell that you live in she said 
you forget that theres another world out there with sunshine and 
love 
ms biesenbach tried to divorce her husband three times and went 
through with it once after he broke her leg she said but he always 
returned 
at the time of the killing they were married under common law 
haynes said a trial which could have lasted two weeks would 
have been hard on ms biesenbach 
she would have had to relive that nightmare that was her 
existence with mr biesenbach haynes said 
however he said he believes a jury would have acquitted her and 
that recent publicity about battered women would have helped her 
i think all the national publicity has caused us to focus on it 
as something that for too long was kept behind closed doors he 
said 
state district judge pat priest accepted haynes request that ms 
biesenbach receive deferred adjudication meaning that if probation 
requirements are met there will be no record of guilt

huey p newton was shot to death tuesday 
in the same troubled neighborhood where he cofounded the militant 
black panther party 23 years ago to protect blacks from police 
violence he was 47 
newton was found lying in a pool of blood in a rundown section of 
oakland where residents fear they are losing the war against drug 
dealing and poverty 
newton along with bobby seale founded the black panthers to 
protect black neighborhoods against what they perceived as a pattern 
of police violence against blacks 
the group was itself frequently associated with violence 
although it also helped organize daycare centers free breakfast 
programs health clinics and a school in oakland 
newton the partys minister of defense was recalled as a 
person who rebelled against the status quo in all forms by chicago 
alderman bobby rush who once headed the panthers chicago chapter 
the huey that i remember was a student of the world and 
made a contribution to the advancement of the ideals of freedom 
justice and equality for all americans rush said 
i would like huey p newton to be remembered as a guy who took 
civil disobedience and put it on the cutting edge where heightened 
contradictions would come to light seale now a community liaison 
with temple universitys africanamerican studies program 
huey newton and the black panther party were romantic symbols 
in the civil rights movement their operational style was 
provocative and dramatic roy innis chairman of the new 
yorkbased congress of racial equality or core 
newton was shot several times including at least once in the 
head according to officer terry foley the shooting was reported to 
police at 529 am and newton was pronounced dead at highland 
hospital at 612 am said sgt dan mercado 
investigators swarmed the crime scene early tuesday but declined 
to describe details of the shooting 
at a news conference tuesday afternoon lt mike sims said there 
were no supects and no apparent motive in the slaying 
at this point theres no evidence to indicate that it was 
drugrelated said sims adding that newton was found on his back 
audrey depalm 29 who lives across the street from the site of 
the shooting said she heard one shot about 515 am followed 
seconds later by three more shots 
shooting is not uncommon in the neighborhood ms depalm said 
but usually it is followed by yelling screeching tires or other 
signs of a dispute this time she said there was silence 
longtime residents recalled that newton began his work with the 
black panthers in the same neighborhood working with local churches 
to serve free breakfasts to youngsters 
newton and seale founded the black panther party for selfdefense 
when a new militancy was taking hold among black youths impatient 
with the slow progress of the civil rights movement 
influenced by malcolm x newton and seale helped define the black 
power movement with their strident criticisms of police and the 
political establishment they epitomized a new image for black 
youth with their afro haircuts black leather jackets black 
berets pressed shirts law books and guns 
the panthers frequently clashed with police newton like other 
panther leaders accumulated a long criminal record and was tried 
five times in two slayings 
huey percy newton was born in louisiana in 1942 the youngest of 
seven children his father a new orleans minister moved the family 
to oakland a year later and took a job with the city streets 
department 
newton attended several public schools in his early years and 
said he became aware early of white teacher prejudice against black 
students because black students often were in the slowreading 
group he said in a 1968 interview blacks concluded that the 
whites were smart and they were dumb 
to compensate for this lack of ability we saw in ourselves we 
would say that whites were smarter but we were stronger he said 
we didnt understand that the white boys had gotten a head start 
from their families because many of them were middleclass and 
through the experience of hearing their families exchange ideas over 
the dinner table they learned to cope with ideas we the blacks 
didnt have this advantage 
the black students he said learned to deal with white 
authorities by fighting them or outmanipulating them or skirting 
their rules and that led to bitter confrontations with the police 
he was convicted of manslaughter for the shooting death of an 
oakland policeman on oct 28 1967 and was sentenced to two to 15 
years but that conviction was overturned on appeal after he served 
two years in prison the charge was dropped after two retrials ended 
in hung juries 
newtons trial in the 1974 shooting death of a 17yearold 
oakland prostitute also ended in a hung jury a retrial ended in a 
hung jury 
newton convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1964 was 
convicted of being a felon in possession of weapons after a 1974 
incident in which he allegedly pistolwhipped his tailor and police 
found two guns in his apartment 
he then fled the country and lived for three years in cuba he 
was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with the incident

tom orloff deputy district attorney for alameda county who 
prosecuted newton in the 1974 case called him a man who lived by 
violence and outside the law and nothing but a gangster 
but others saw a different person 
to us huey newton was a hero said audrey depalms brother 
fred who was awakened by the gunshots tuesday morning the black 
panthers were a thing to identify with along with malcolm x and 
martin luther king 
charles garry newtons lawyer for many years hailed him as the 
founder of the renaissance of the black liberation movement 
garry said he never saw a violent side of newton 
i saw a very sweet side a humane side a dignified side a man 
who was theoretically in favor of a better world 
garry said newton became paranoid and his personality changed 
years ago when he was targeted by the fbi whose agents tried to 
infiltrate and disrupt the black panthers through an operation known 
as cointelpro the counterintelligence program set up to destroy 
civil rights organizations has been credited with or blamed for 
helping destroy the black panthers 
when newton received a doctor of philosophy degree at age 38 from 
the university of california at santa cruz his dissertation was 
titled war against the panthers a study of repression in 
america 
the black panthers eventually broke apart amid infighting 
arrests deaths imprisonments and differing philosophies 
especially between newton and eldridge cleaver the onetime panther 
information minister and author of soul on ice who underwent a 
startling transformation into a bornagain christian and republican 
earlier this year newton drew six months in jail after pleading 
no contest to misappropriating 15000 in public money earmarked for 
a school the panthers ran in the early 1980s he was already in jail 
at the time for parole violation 
in 1969 panthers mark clark and fred hampton were killed in a 
predawn police raid at their chicago headquarters police had 
ostenstibly been searching for weapons 
clark and hamptons relatives and other survivors of the raid 
successfully sued city state and federal officials and were awarded 
185 million in 1983 
at one point in 1977 the panthers flirted with conventionality 
when newton and other panther leaders accepted a resolution from two 
state assemblymen commending the panthers for their oakland 
community school 
the visit which included an escorted tour of the state capitol 
with 10 of the children took place a decade after about 40 black 
panthers marched through the capitol on may 2 1967 carrying loaded 
rifles pistols and shotguns to protest a bill restricting the 
carrying of arms in public the panthers left the capitol peacefully 
after guards confiscated the weapons unloaded them and returned 
them 
twentyfour panthers had been arrested that day on conspiracy 
charges although no shots were fired and there were no injuries 
most charges were later dropped 
newton didnt participate in the incident but appeared at the 
arraignment saying there was a conspiracy against the black 
world we will not tolerate any more of this action well let 
the consequences speak for themselves 
during the more peaceful 1977 capitol tour newton told 
reporters our basic goals and our basic ambitions have not 
changed there has been some change in tactics 
there are changes in the united states changes in awareness 
but not in structure we have always been dedicated to 
progressive change and were glad that other people are joining 
us

the cry was get your red hots comrade on 
tuesday as the head of a fast food chain served up samples of the 
hot dogs his company plans to begin selling this fall in the heart 
of red square 
for less than 1 rubles about 225 a nathans famous stand 
in moscows gum department store will sell hot dogs flown in from 
the united states and served on a russianmade bun 
nathans hot dogs have been hailed as a most succulent slice of 
american democracy since they were first served in 1916 at coney 
island and we are confident that muscovite shoppers and tourists 
will feel that same sensation chairman stuart a benson said 
theyll be able for the first time to have at a reasonable 
price quality food benson said at a news conference at a 
nathans famous on broadway where he served free hot dogs to 
soviets at the announcement and passersby 
sergei a goryachev mayor of the lenin district of moscow 
credited perestroika mikhail gorbachevs drive to restructure the 
soviet economy with bringing american fast food to the soviet 
union 
soviet and nathans officials said the hot dog stand which they 
hope to open by october would be the first of its kind in the 
country pizza hut and mcdonalds also have plans to open outlets in 
the soviet union the officials said 
what people will get is a different experience goryachev 
said through a translator if they want to eat quickly they can 
eat quickly if they dont want to eat quickly they can go to a 
restaurant anything that they want they can have 
nikolai vladimirov who heads the food trust overseeing eateries 
in the lenin district said soviets have a sausage similar to a hot 
dog but it is breaded and fried 
while probably not what vladimir i lenin had in mind for his 
country when he led the communist revolution of 1917 the joint 
venture would be good for both sides goryachev said 
the main thing is that americans and russians are working 
together eating together and they will become friends he said 
and some of the capitalistic values of their new american friends 
apparently has already rubbed off 
we wish you from our delegation a good spirit and to help 
people and to serve the people goryachev said in a toast and 
most importantly to have a profit

gen manuel antonio noriega 
said tuesday the opposition made an historic error when it 
refused what he said was an offer to share in the government 
starting sept 1 
talks between the noriegacontrolled government and the 
opposition to resolve the countrys political stalemate ended monday 
with no solution in sight 
the opposition refused an offer to form a joint government to 
rule after the current administrations term ends sept 1 
and the government rejected the opposition demands that it 
recognize the oppositions claim that it won the may 7 elections and 
that noriega step down as commander of the defense forces 
more than was given cannot be given noriega said they 
have committed an historic error we offered half the government and 
they with the great economic capacity and with the support of the 
united states could have seized all the government it was an error 
of idiots who were programmed to say no to everything 
noriega spoke after a military ceremony commemorating the return 
of the rio hato military base to panama by the united states in 1970 
both sides said they would await wednesdays organization of 
american states meeting in washington before deciding what action to 
take the oas arranged and mediated the talks which have been held 
sporadically since midjuly 
i insist they were offered everything absolutely everything 
in an operation of goodwill on the part of the negotiators 
noriega said 
he said romulo escobar a government representative to the talks 
offered more than he was authorized to offer and that would have 
been a big problem for romulo 
asked what escobar had offered he said he was handing over 
half of all the government 
international observers said opposition presidential candidate 
guillermo endara was ahead 31 in the may balloting when noriega had 
the election annulled 
the opposition wants to take office sept 1 when the terms of 
acting president manuel solis palma and the legislative assembly 
expire 
endara said monday the opposition did not agree to govern jointly 
because we are not going after power they are offering part of 
the power we are going after democracy justice and freedom 
the united states has been using economic and diplomatic pressure 
to try to force noriega to step down since he was indicted on 
federal narcotics trafficking charges in florida in february 1988 
noriega denies the charges and says the united states wants to 
avoid giving panama full control of the panama canal at the end of 
1999 as specified in 1977 treaties 
it is an insult that foreign countries that some foreign 
leaders want to dictate to us what we have to do noriega said 
tuesday that is humiliating we are not a tribe we know what we 
have to do 
here what we want is respect nothing more he said

inspection service 
after delivery the indian grain cooperative marketing federation 
complained of aflatoxin contamination to lyle sabranek agricultural 
counselor of the american embassy in new delhi the indian embassy 
in washington said 
the embassy had no additional details but tanner said the us 
inspector and other concerned american and indian officials are 
thoroughly investigating the matter in india 
the report from india prompted the agriculture department to 
recheck its samples of the shipment confirming that the corn was 
uncontaminated at the time it left seattle tanner said 
aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen produced by a fungus during hot 
and dry weather that theoretically could materialize during 
shipment the poison appeared in middle western us states during 
the 1988 drought and again this year in texas 
the wall street journal said tuesday the appearance of aflatoxin 
in india could be an example of poisoned corn leaking through 
the inspection system or a case of the fungus producing aflatoxin 
after the grain had left us ports 
the journal said it obtained incomplete records showing that more 
than 24 million bushels more than 600000 metric tons of us corn 
exports amounting to 24 shiploads contained some contamination 
between october and april in what the newspaper described as a lax 
and imperfect inspection program 
while confirming that intended destinations included japan saudi 
arabia and spain tanner said he had no additional information and 
asserted that the government would not knowingly permit shipment of 
contaminated grain cargo 
he said reports from india left many questions unanswered such 
as how much of the almost 4 million bushels 100000 metric tons of 
corn loaded for india arrived contaminated and what detection 
techniques were being used

sometimes history is less than great 
events and memorable dates sometimes its coverlets and plows 
soda bottles and signs 
sometimes the commonplace is evidence of the past 
a coloredonly sign makes a beautiful piece of history 
said alferdteen harrison director of the margaret walker alexander 
research center at jackson state university 
put the sign up and it immediately communicates an era a 
place she said recently see it now its completely out of 
character 
harrison has used other less painful relics to depict black life 
in mississippi during the segregation era her work was the basis 
for those that stayed home during the great migration 
1915present a companion exhibit to the traveling version of the 
smithsonian institutions field to factory afroamerican 
migration 19151940 
the exhibits opened sunday at the smith robertson museum and 
cultural center in jackson smith robertson and jackson state are 
cosponsoring the exhibits 
other activities associated with the exhibits include a national 
symposium on the great migration sept 1415 at jackson state 
while field to factory examines the forces that led 600000 
black mississippians to move north those that stayed home looks 
at the lives of blacks who remained in the south 
both presentations tell their stories through ordinary objects 
essential to daily life 
in my mind its threedimensional objects that are remnants of 
peoples lives that come before us said spencer crew curator of 
the smithsonian exhibit its our way of beginning to see feel 
and study that aspect of their lives 
over the years the most pedestrian items have turned into 
historical treasures 
the hardest thing to find was a broom that a factory janitor 
would use crew said explaining that the broom illustrated the 
change in tools as workers went from planting crops to punching 
clocks 
harrison however said she had no difficulty finding artifacts 
donations of items have flowed in since smith robertson mounted its 
first exhibit in the early 1980s 
the museum caught on she said if people had kept up the 
effort we wouldnt have a place to put stuff 
one benefactor gave the entire contents of a country store 
including a glass display case empty bottles of vernors ginger 
ale masons root beer and orangette lemonade and a full bottle of 
666 tonic 
those bottles carry the essence of culture harrison said 
culture is the way people live from day to day its made up of 
technology instututions art and language

usair said tuesday it asked federal officials 
for details of charges that its pilots have been annoying air 
traffic controllers in an apparent protest over the pace of contract 
talks with the carrier 
the federal aviation administration reported the trouble in a 
letter from peter bernhard air traffic manager at greater 
pittsburgh international airport to usair pilots 
i have never been so concerned about our working relationship 
with professional aviators as i am now bernhard wrote 
the trouble apparently began aug 5 the day usair merged with 
piedmont airlines usairs 6000 pilots have been working under an 
extension of their old contract for the last year 
bernhard said usair jets have taxied at unusually slow speeds and 
pilots have blocked or slowed communications with the tower 
pilots also have insisted on using bad weather landing procedures 
in good weather requiring controllers to space planes farther 
apart and they have reduced airspeed without first notifying the 
tower he said 
bernhard said his aug 10 letter was an appeal to their 
professionalism my controllers are frustrated 
the job actions were not a threat to safety bernhard said 
because there are not enough pilots participating if it was more 
widespread wed be concerned about safety right now its more of an 
annoyance to controllers 
usair spokesman john bronson in pittsburgh said the airlines 
flight records show no evidence of concerted action by pilots he 
said joseph mclaughlin usairs vice president of flying asked the 
faa to provide the airline with details that might help identify 
pilots 
mclaughlin told the faa he was shocked and dismayed by the 
reports 
while i understand some of our pilots are unhappy with the 
progress of our current contract negotiations i fully expect them 
to continue to conduct themselves in the professional manner that 
you have long grown accustomed to he said in a letter 
john mazor spokesman for the airline pilots association said he 
was unaware of any slowdown order for members at usair 
usair was fined 2000 last month after its pilots were caught 
deliberately jamming conversations between the philadelphia tower 
and eastern airlines pilots the pilots union is striking eastern

white house officials appeared to 
close the door on any possibility of sending troops to help colombia 
fight drug traffickers tuesday as the south american nation moved to 
extradite one man who faces drug charges in the united states 
asked for a second day about reports that the administration was 
considering sending military help to colombia white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said simply its not going to happen 
president bush vacationing at his seaside resort home 
telephoned colombian president virgilio barco on monday night to 
express condolences on the assassination of presidential candidate 
luis carlos galan reported to have been gunned down by drug 
traffickers 
in that conversation barco specifically said he did not want us 
troops to get involved according to fitzwater 
the bushbarco conversation and further statements from white 
house officials on tuesday squelched earlier suggestions from bush 
himself and attorney general dick thornburgh that the united states 
might be considering military troops as an option if colombia 
requested such aid 
barco has made no such request nor did he seek nonmilitary aid 
to deal withhis countrys heightening drugrelated crisis said 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen 
she said the justice department was working on the extradition 
matter following barcos action easing procedures that have impeded 
extraditions to the united states since 1988 
in washington the justice department named the dozen most 
wanted alleged colombian drug traffickers that it would like to 
extradite including the leadership of the medellin and cali cocaine 
cartels the list did not include an alleged major moneylaunderer 
eduardo martinez romero 
colombian authorities said they had arrested martinez who is 
under indictment in the united states where he is suspected of being 
a financial chief of the medellin drug cartel colombian national

to colombia including usmade helicopters drug enforcement 
agency agents to work with colombian officials and defense 
department advisers to the colombian military

security experts to colombia saying were not aware of any team 
going there 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity had said the 
administration was preparing to send security experts to advise 
judges magistrates and journalists groups who have been targets 
of drug gangs on how to improve security a 5 million program 
along those lines was approved by congress over a year ago 
the developments on the international drug scene came as bush was 
getting word from a new poll that americans approve of his handling 
of antidrug efforts even before the official announcement next 
month of the administrations antidrug strategy 
the abc newswashington post poll said respondents in a sample of 
1509 people questioned by telephone aug 17 to aug 21 approved of 
bushs antidrug efforts 54 percent to 40 percent the poll said it 
had a likely margin of error of three percentage points either way 
bush on an extended vacation with family members continued his 
holiday pattern of jogging tennis and boating 
his wife barbara however returned to washington for an eye 
examination due to continuing eye irritation stemming from graves 
disease a thyroid imbalance 
doctors at walter reed army hospital switched her medication from 
cortisone to prednisone because her eye symptoms had not improved 
they said her thyroid problem was under control 
the president told reporters who jogged with him that his wifes 
eyes had been bothering her again although she felt fine otherwise 
aides said she suffered double vision despite treatment earlier

gathered on the rocky shore chatting about the beautiful weather 
and his plans to spend most of the day on the water 
he had his fishing gear with him 
when he said the water temperature was nice reporters asked if 
he wanted to repeat his impromptu leap into the sea that he 
performed saturday on a dare from his children the president 
declined

war is hell but peace isnt any easier 
particularly if youre a member of a british army entertainment unit 
presenting a tacky jungle jamboree to the troops in malaya in 
1948 
out of such show biz misery comes privates on parade peter 
nichols quasiautobiographical remembrances of british imperialism 
in decline after world war ii 
the play with music which opened tuesday at offbroadways 
roundabout theater is a gloriously funny evening of caustic social 
and political commentary interspersed with hilarious song and dance 
and privates on parade works on both levels nichols tweaks 
the nose of the british establishment personified in the play by 
maj giles flack who wont let anything not even the theater 
interfere with god and country 
flack played by the unflappable and marvelously comic simon 
jones stands in contrast to his charges members of sadusea song 
and dance unit south east asia they may have been drafted 
unwillingly into show business but once on stage cant get it out 
of their blood 
the play chronicles the adventures of this ragtag bunch of 
performers particularly the young and impressionable pvt steven 
flowers played with just the right amount of innocence and earnest 
righteousness by jim fyfe 
its flowers introduction indoctrination and assimilation into 
the troupe that takes up much of the action in privates on 
parade the performers are led by acting capt terri dennis a 
flamboyant frustrated musical comedy star played on the edge of 
manic outrageousness by jim dale 
dale is a music hall marvel he has a rapport not only with the 
other performers but with the audience as well its dale who gets 
most of the musical turns decimating in drag such campy icons as 
marlene dietrich carmen miranda and vera lynn he also does a 
devastating turn as noel coward wondering why things have turned out 
so rotten even though the allies won the war 
nichols lyrics when they can be heard in the roundabouts 
sounddeadening auditorium are witty the music by denis king 
affectionately echoes the old songs he is spoofing and theres one 
little rouser a catchy title tune that begins as a march and ends 
in a highkicking chorus line fashioned by choreographer daniel 
pelzig 
the plays nearly two dozen scenes blend fluidly into each other 
director larry carpenter uses a front cloth much like a curtain in 
old vaudeville theaters to separate scenes as well as the musical 
numbers from the dramatic action 
nichols author of joe egg another fine roundabout 
production has been generous to the other actors in the play each 
gets a chance to shine particularly john curry as the troupes one 
decent member who understands what the british have done wrong in 
malaya ross bickell as a foulmouthed corporal edward hibbert as 
the worlds most inept magician and donna murphy the companys sole 
female and love interest for young flowers 
for all its comedy privates on parade has a serious and 
violent side nichols doesnt let the audience forget the 
consequences of british rule not only for the ruled but for the 
rulers themselves 
the play was first done in london in 1977 and had its american 
premiere at the long wharf theater in connecticut four years ago 
why it has taken so long to get to new york is anybodys guess just 
be grateful that privates on parade has finally arrived

the voyager 2 spacecraft found at least 
one complete ring of debris orbiting neptune surprising scientists 
who discovered it while trying to relocate a partial ring dubbed the 
lost arc nasa said tuesday 
two partial rings called ring arcs appeared in pictures 
voyager made aug 11 as it approached the solar systems fourth 
largest planet but the arc that orbits 17000 miles above neptunes 
cloudtops couldnt be found in subsequent images prompting 
researchers to dub it the lost arc or ghost arc 
when scientists rediscovered it in a series of 16 photographs 
sent back tuesday it seemed reasonable that this was indeed the 
lost arc our imaging team raiders were looking for team leader 
bradford smith said 
but instead of being an arc it turns out to be a complete 
circle a complete ring it goes all the way around neptunes 
first complete ring smith said during a news conference at the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the new photos also show the second and larger arc which orbits 
23300 miles above neptunes cloudtops extends farther around 
neptune than previously believed suggesting that it also may be a 
complete ring but with regions of greater and lesser amounts of 
material in it smith said 
he said the answer may not come until neptunes ring system is 
photographed while backlighted by distant sunlight that will happen 
after voyager makes its closest approach to neptune by passing 3000 
miles over the planets north pole cloudtops at 855 pm pdt 
thursday 
voyager already has discovered four neptunian moons in addition 
to nereid and backwardorbiting triton which were discovered from 
earth 
asked if voyager has found more moons smith replied suspects 
have been seen here and there i would expect several more 
satellites moons 
by 9 am pdt wednesday voyager will be 2747 billion miles from 
earth and 1386 million miles from neptune speeding toward the 
giant planet at 37855 mph the spacecraft has traveled a curving 
44billionmile path since it was launched in 1977 
voyagers activity list tuesday included taking 39 more photos to 
look for ring arcs or rings six photos of the recently discovered 
moon 1989 n1 22 images of triton and 66 pictures of neptunes 
surprisingly active weather patterns which include a variety of 
clouds 400mph winds and an earthsized cyclone called the great 
dark spot 
the spaceship also was programmed to make 73 ultraviolet images 
of the planet some of them to look for southern and northern 
lights or auroras created as electrons are sucked toward neptunes 
poles along magnetic field lines 
voyager also used a light sensor tuesday to look for variations 
in tritons surface brightness providing clues to the moons 
structure and makeup the moons polar icecaps may extend to the 
equator during winter at each pole stone said smith said the moon 
may have snowstorms of frozen methane or natural gas at times 
stone said voyagers infrared sensor was measuring heat patterns 
near neptunes poles in an attempt to understand the planets 
turbulent weather 
the discovery of at least one complete ring around neptune was 
surprising stone said two months ago that the planet might be 
orbited by 50 to 100 partial rings of debris 
he backed away from that prediction tuesday saying it was based 
on the possibility that the gravitational pull of some 
stillundiscovered moon inclined out of the planets equatorial 
plane might shepherd dozens of rings arcs 
instead it looks like two of the moons discovered by voyager 
might be shepherds for the complete ring and ring arc both moons 
orbit the planets equator 
scientists had said ring arcs could be the remnants of moons torn 
apart by gravitational forces or collisions smith said it isnt yet 
known if the ring material seen so far consists of boulder pebble 
or dustsized debris

dozens of injuries 
the rupture caused the elevator one of four on the aircraft 
carrier capable of hoisting bombladen jets to come to an immediate 
stop navy cmdr shawn etter a ships officer said 
the jolt and spray of hydraulic fluid caused riders to panic and 
stampede off the platform he said 
panic seems to have been what caused most of the problems and 
injuries etter said he added that he had never before seen such 
a hydraulic problem with the elevator which is designed to carry up 
to 120000 pounds 
there were an estimated 60 people on the elevator platform and

were listed in fair condition tuesday night said hospital spokesman 
craig biles 
the rest of the injured were treated for minor bumps and bruises 
and had hydraulic fluid flushed from their eyes in the ships 
infirmary lanza said 
it happened so quickly one minute we were riding the elevator 
and the next it was a stampede said tom boehm of fort lauderdale 
all of a sudden we heard this loud hissing noise and people 
started running and pushing to get away from it said karen nitsch 
of fort lauderdale i didnt see anyone seriously injured but we 
were all scared to death 
the navy quickly canceled the days tours on the ship and 
evacuated all civilians on board officers didnt say immediately 
whether the planned twoday open house would resume wednesday

tau kappa epsilon the nations largest 
college social fraternity announced tuesday that it had ended 
pledging in an effort to stop dangerous hazing making it the second 
fraternity in a week to do so 
hazing has long been a problem in the fraternity system said 
tj schmitz the fraternitys executive vice president we have 
tried numerous programs to eradicate it from the fraternity but so 
far none have accomplished the task 
legislation banning pledging was passed by undergraduate 
delegates from the fraternitys more than 280 chapters during the 
45th national convention here last weekend 
instead of a pledge period new tke recruits will be initiated 
immediately tke has more than 177000 initiated members and 16000 
active undergraduate members 
last week zeta beta tau announced that it was eliminating the 
traditional pledge period 
pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was meant to be a 
rite of passage for new recruits before their initiation as full 
members it has come under fire recently after scattered deaths of 
freshmen pledges in initiation rites that have included heavy 
drinking and humiliation 
eileen stevens founder of the new yorkbased committee to halt 
useless college killings spoke to delegates during the convention 
and urged them to ban pledging 
more than 50 students have died from hazing incidents during 
the last 10 years whenever you have a twotiered system where there 
are members and pledges the opportunity for hazing exists said 
stevens whose son died in a hazing incident

assaulted by their parents authorities said tuesday there may have 
been three other children who did not survive their first month and 
were secretly buried 
there were 11 people living in a darkened apartment with little 
access to the outside world they only knew this way of life they

the oldest children suffered most from the sexual abuse and the 
younger children from physical abuse demartino said 
police dug up a slope where mcmillan told police he had buried 
two infants no bodies were found tuesday 
police said they believed those two children were born within the 
last 3 years and died at less than a month of age but whether of 
violence disease or neglect was not known 
we have no reason at this point to believe they were killed by 
the parents said demartino they disposed of the bodies 
the last of the missing children may have been stillborn 
demartino said police and city welfare officials went to the 
mcmillans onebedroom apartment in the new york city borough of the 
bronx on may 25 in response to neighbors complaints that the 
children were being neglected 
when the people went into the apartment they found it to be 
extremely dark demartino said no electricity filthy strewn 
with dirty clothing and newspapers windows covered with dirty 
rags and sheets and the children appeared frightened and dirty

10 5 and 2 years and a 4monthold and girls of 14 8 and 6 years

father on two counts of rape four of sodomy 13 of felonious 
assault two of incest two of reckless endangerment nine of 
endangering the welfare of a minor and one of sexual abuse the 
mother was charged with two assaults and nine endangerings 
we dont have any information that they were hyperreligious 
cultish said demartino he was protective of his family he 
believed his way of life was best that he knew best how to educate 
his children 
they were recluses the husband would come and go occasionally 
the wife remained in the apartment the children remained in the 
apartment they did little or nothing he said 
demartino said that although the building was a known drug 
location there was no evidence of narcotics in the apartment 
neighbors said mcmillan never spoke and ignored greetings as he 
came and went in the building 
the children were heard but rarely seen a man next door said 
that if any of the children looked out the kitchen window mcmillan 
would grab them back and used to hit the kids and beat them 
mcmillan originally from north carolina did occasional work as 
a laborer and received 554 a month from social security the chief 
said his wife came from connecticut it was not known how long they 
have lived in the city

tuesday night in the assassination of leading presidential candidate 
luis carlos galan at a campaign rally authorities have blamed 
cocaine traffickers for his death 
the five were presented to local reporters at national police 
headquarters and shown on television they were dressed in casual 
wellworn clothing 
all five are colombians police said and identified them as 
armando bernal acosta norberto morillo charalca pedro zembrano 
delgado luis gonzalez chacon and jubis hazvumb 
police said the five men were arrested at a downtown apartment

their nationwide crackdown on the drug underworld the countrys 
judges planned to return to their duties ending a strike called 
after a judge and police official were killed thursday 
the extradition of eduardo martinez romero said to manage funds 
for the notorious medellin cartel was seen as a test of a 
government pledge to hand over cocaine traffickers wanted in the 
united states the powerful cocaine cartels have cowed the courts in 
the past through a systematic campaign of terror 
martinez escaped arrest last spring in panama on the day us 
officials announced his indictment in connection with the 
druglaundering scheme the indictment followed an investigation 
which resulted in charges against 127 people and two latin american 
banks 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in washington that the 
united states is moving to extradite martinez even though his name 
was not on a list of the dozen most wanted drug traffickers 
thornburgh sent tuesday to the colombian government the list 
focused on the leaders of the medellin and cali cartels 
on tuesday columnist francisco santos expressed the publics 
outrage at the friday murder of sen galan an outspoken foe of the 
drug lords

its members 
col oscar carmona chief of the judicial investigations 
division said the extradition process began tuesday with the 
dispatch of notes to the justice ministry and us embassy informing 
them of the arrest 
radio reports quoting unidentified government sources said 
officials at the justice ministry and president virgilio barcos 
office were drawing up specific procedures for handing martinez over 
to the united states 
one of several emergency measures barco announced friday gave his 
government the authority to extradite drug dealers without judicial 
review relieving the besieged judiciary of responsibility 
since 1981 assassins working for the cocaine barons have killed 
220 judges magistrates and judicial aides 
martinez would be the first drug suspect sent to the united 
states since 1987 when the supreme court nullified an extradition 
treaty that had been used to deliver 14 purported drug dealers 
invoking powers under the state of siege in effect since 1984 
barco also authorized confiscation of the property of alleged drug 
dealers a nationwide seizure of estates ranches and businesses

grounds he knew about suhs august 1988 trip to north two months 
before the case was made public in june 1989 they said they also 
have evidence he received 10000 from suh who had received the 
money from north korean agents 
kim has vigorously denied the allegations and accused the 
government of harassment and trying to embarrass and discredit his 
party

indicted in the suh case

april 1988 was expelled from the party for peace and democracy 
after his trip to the north was made public the seoul government 
prohibits unauthorized visits to the north and failure to report

president kim il sung in pyongyang in august 1988 and giving 10000 
to kim daejung in seoul 
the prosecutors also claimed that suh in midapril told kim

compared the killing of palestinian collaborating with israel to the 
slaying of europeans who aided nazi occupation forces during world

purported collaborators in the israelioccupied territories arafat 
responded are you against it are you against it 
they are quislings those who are coordinating with our 
enemies 
how many quislings were killed in europe during the nazi 
occupation and even after the withdrawal you remember what 
happened in paris he asked referring to attacks on french people 
who collaborated with german forces during world war ii

chance to repent and should be singled out for punishment only by 
the palestinian leadership not individuals

the 20 months of the uprising against israeli occupation israeli 
troops and settlers have killed at least 545 palestinians during the 
uprising and 38 israelis have perished

joe pytkas name might be unfamiliar to 
moviegoers but his commercials certainly arent 
from madonnas shortlived pepsi spot go ahead make a wish 
to bo jacksons celebrityfilled nike plug just do it pytkas 
tv ads rattle with vivid visuals of his eclectic offbeat style 
but in making a movie let it ride starring richard 
dreyfuss the attentiongrabbing director had to tone it down and 
make his bold camera work disappear 
in a commercial you kind of grab people by the back of the 
neck and shove them in said pytka who also directed the dirty 
diana and the way you make me feel music videos for michael 
jackson 
in commercials i become a performer for my clients he said 
in a film i was just one of the crew i was invisible on this 
film in a film you have to let people participate i think that 
films that tend to be bombastic wear you out before theyre over 
let it ride is a comedy about a compulsive gambler named jay 
trotter dreyfuss who has a really good day at the races joining 
trotter at the track are his unlucky pal looney david johansen 
also known as the musician buster poindexter and his frustrated 
wife pam teri garr the movie also costars allen garfield 
jennifer tilly and michelle phillips 
at 90 minutes let it ride runs substantially longer than any 
commercial or music video pytka has made among other things the 11 
weeks of filming showed him that the movie business operates on an 
entirely different level than the ad world 
the level of performing you work with in a film like this is so 
far beyond what would be available to you in a commercial pytka 
said most commercials are populated by models and attractive 
people theyre not actors 
commercial spots are usually cast visually you cast 
stereotypically in a commercial somebody has to look like somebody 
because you only have 30 seconds and thats it you cast businessmen 
who look like businessmen mothers who look like mothers and the 
performance is usually just one note you dont have climaxes and 
you dont have to work with range 
here the care and feeding of the performer is the primary 
concern this is a performance film totally this film will live 
and die on the merits of its performance 
in its first weekend of release let it ride failed to make a 
killing at the box office it debuted at no 12 on the charts 
grossing 19 million 
pytka said he has wanted to make a dramatic feature films for 
years 
i started out doing documentaries and i got frustrated he 
said a film is the natural extension of any desire to work in 
film its the ultimate for an actor its the ultimate for a 
filmmaker 
richard was attached to the project when the script was given 
to me and you dont turn down an opportunity to work with a person 
of that caliber for me as a firsttime film director to be able 
to work with somebody like dreyfuss is a thing you dont turn down 
though pleased with his debut performance pytka is bothered that 
movies invite far less daring than commercials 
i would love to do a film like my commercials he said but 
you cant get surreal in films too much filmmaking is a public art 
it needs a big public response 
i just did a commercial where these lumberjacks are being 
chased by a yeti they run into their truck their truck is too 
small to carry them all so they get out of the truck they pull on 
the truck and stretch it into a bigger truck get into the truck and 
drive away 
the yeti just misses them and kicks the dirt that is surreal 
when you try to do something like that in the movies it doesnt 
get a response

hes at it again trumpeting the beginning of the 
end the rapture edgar whisenant misdated it before 
incorrectly exciting a lot of people but now hes touting a new 
deadline next friday 
everything points to it says the retired nasa rocket 
engineer all the evidence has piled up 
this time however warning criticisms were being sounded against 
buying his revised endtime scenario although there were 
indications of another bible belt surge of attention to it 
heavy circulation of whisenants new 96page book the final 
shout rapture report 1989 was reported across the south in 
many cases in free mailings by the nashville tenn publisher 
world bible society 
the time is short says whisenant im telling people the 
end is near and to get their children and everyone they care about 
under the blood of jesus 
the rev bill gordon of atlanta associate director of the 
southern baptist interfaith witness department issued a paper 
urging people not to be deceived by whisenants rapture 
predictions 
whisenant builds his predictions upon misinterpretation 
misapplication and conjecture gordon says he constantly takes 
scriptural passages out of context and gives them meanings which the 
biblical writers would find strange 
gordon says whisenants book reads more like an indiana jones 
movie than good theology 
whisenant 56 of little rock ark said in a telephone 
interview i dont care what they call me or what they say about 
me as long as theyve heard what im telling them 
like ripley they can believe it or not they dont have to be 
surprised when it happens unless they choose to be 
if i didnt tell them then their blood would be on my hands 
god would hold me accountable no matter what they say ill say 
what i think even if it kills me when i believe its the truth and 
its important 
im giving it my best shot win lose or draw im home free 
with god 
whisenant formerly a kennedy space center electrical engineer 
involved in the early rocket launches and moonlanding program 
retired in 1968 he said he has concentrated since then on analyzing 
biblical prophecy 
its an obsession he said but its not an ego trip its 
a fear trip the fear of god 
he first gained public notice with his small book 88 reasons 
why the rapture will be in l988 with a reported 45 million 
copies sold or given away 
whisenant said he was mistaken in setting the date as september 
1988 chiefly because his mathematical calculations were off by one 
year due to a quirk in the modern gregorian calendar 
comments gordon the amazing thing is that so many christians 
took him seriously citing reports indicating another huge 
distribution of the revised prognostications gordon says 
the lord jesus will come again when the father chooses and not 
according to mr whisenants timetable 
whisenant said he previously failed to consider that the calendar 
counts only 99 years in the first century beginning with ad 1 
instead of a zero year other centuries begin with a zero year such 
as 1900 
he said that detail plus a maze of other numerical computations 
and allusions from scripture and historical events put the date 
ahead to this coming sept 1 1989 
im confident about it more strongly than before he said 
adding that he was 96 percent certain with the other 4 percent 
allotted to the next four years up to 1993 
he said he had concluded that last year actually was intended as 
a preliminary notice or shout that the bridgegoom cometh as 
mentioned in matt 25113 before actually appearing 
this shout gave gods people a oneyear awakening so they would 
be ready whisenant said 
at the rapture he said 40 million bornagain christians 
will undergo an instantaneous chemical body change their new bodies 
able to appear and disappear and pass through walls 
he said theyll remain on earth up to nine days before joining 
christ in heavens third level after which there will be seven years 
of earthly tribulation including three nuclear wars before a final 
armageddon 
at that point he said jesus will descend with his angels 
victorious in the final war and beginning a 1000year reign of 
peace and prosperity before the last judgment 
whisenant said his book last year earned 55 million for the 
publisher but he himself took no royalty ill get all my reward 
in heaven he said he said its ok if the publisher prefers 
rewards in this world adding 
ill take mine in the next i dont think im wrong ive put 
my life on it i just believe the bible the way its written 
get your heart right with jesus its like picking up a 
thousanddollar bill on the sidewalk its that simple

nationwide late at night about four million 
people keep company with four men before turning off the television 
faithful viewers of late night with david letterman know 
these men as the worlds most dangerous band 
dave started it explained the kinetic bass guitarist will 
lee referring to the origin of the bands name the sardonic host 
tossed out a number of nicknames on air the party boys of rock n 
roll the nbc orchestra and repeatedly the worlds most dangerous 
band 
that one stuck 
rounding out the band are sid mcginnis on guitar anton fig 
playing drums and paul shaffer as keyboardist and frontman 
together and individually they have developed a devoted 
following almost cultlike 
we get quite a lot of mail said the drummer in the bands 
dressing room which is just large enough for a small couch and 
water cooler 
especially this guy interjected lee indicating fig he 
gets mail he gets clothes he gets trailer houses some woman sent 
him a casino one time hes doing great 
letterman himself is also a genuine fan he loves musicians 
and airline pilots and professional sportsmen said fig 
theyre the most entertaining and best part of the show each 
night letterman said in a telephone interview the band is 
always a constant source of energy regardless of whatever else goes 
tumbling down 
the band is an integral element of the onehour talk show 
although they play music for a total of four to five minutes the 
band creates a mood 
their break tunes going into and coming out of commercials 
raise the energy level of the studio audience often the songs are 
chosen on the spur of the moment to play off a remark made by 
letterman or a guest 
sometimes the right song is one theyve never played before 
we have a basic song list that we fall back on but through the 
whole show were whispering over there said mcginnis who is seen 
most nights wearing his yellow and black sneakers that match the 
bumble bee color scheme of his guitar 
the band also plays with the shows healthy spectrum of musical 
guests from the bee gees to iggy pop yma sumac to miles davis and 
phil collins in one week late night had jackson browne pete 
townshend and xtc 
we all have to do our homework and play like were in that 
band said shaffer whose bespectacled elton john look dates from 
his days arranging music for saturday night live 
our duty is to back up the artists we dissect the record see 
what style we have to play each day 
band members receive tapes of the chosen performers the day 
before that particular show but theres usually little time for 
group rehearsal outside the roughly 45 minutes the band has with the 
featured guest before taping begins at 530 pm the show in its 
eighth season airs weeknights at 1230 am edt 
its getting easier its like listen to the song on the way 
to the show and you got it said fig 
the late night band is active off camera performing at 
various festivals concerts and with artists such as donna summer 
was not was the neville brothers and hall and oates 
they even did a wedding 
it was a favor to a good friend said lee and we needed 
the rehearsal 
we played the set we were going to play the next night for our 
concert added fig the wedding was sort of incidental 
that concert was their first live recording for two songs on 
shaffers debut album coast to coast released this month on 
capitol records shaffer collaborated with artists he admired 
including the members of the worlds most dangerous band producing 
music ranging from guitar rock to blues surfing instrumentals to 
a marriage of doowop and hiphop 
guest artists include valerie simpson carole king dion johnny 
maestro allen toussaint bobby womack joe walsh brian wilson and 
the fresh prince 
maybe so many of them did the album because they could hear 
themselves in my music speculated shaffer they understood what 
i was doing

among the affects of public law 100418 which is 
supposed to enhance american competitiveness is to convert the 
nations forests into massive piles of studies that few people will 
read 
as those paper mountains grow so will the bureaucracy needed to 
tend them to store them and index them for example and to exhume 
them now and again for seminars and conferences that produce nothing 
these are some of the results of the law whose full 
identification is the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 
in the name of competitiveness and the furtherance of it the law 
contains at least 272 reporting and paperworks requirements it 
mandates new studies reports advisory committees interagency 
groups meetings seminars and conferences to feed the insatiable 
curiosity of members of congress 
the phrase in quotations marks is from murray weidenbaum chief 
economic adviser in the early months of the reagan administration 
he is appalled at the legislation which he says would flunk a 
truthinlabeling test 
after reading the 467page law weidenbaum describes it as an 
example of the inability of congress to control itself under the 
guise of dealing with competitiveness he says it responded to 
pressure groups and idle curiosities 
it also reversed the recent trend toward reducing the federal 
paperwork burdenecologists should mourn for all the trees that 
will be cut down to provide paper for what will literally be an 
endles array of studies he says 
weidenbaum now heads the center for the study of american 
business an academictype institution at washington university st 
louis that affords him the time to indulge in a study of the 
massive document while in washington he never could have done so 
he doesnt think many of those now there will either 
for the president alone he says the law dictates four onetime 
reports two periodic reports two openended reports and two new 
committees is this the way to increase american competitiveness he 
asks 
such a burden is awesome he says and he suggests it becomes 
depressing to dwell on the possibility indeed the likelihood that 
many of those reports will never be read especially by members of 
congress who demanded them 
every time the president makes a trade agreement with a foreign 
country he must in addition to telling congress what if anything 
they must do to implement the agreement send them a report on 
efforts he has made to obtain international exchange rate 
equilibrium 
the report must also indicate what effect the agreement will have 
on increased international monetary stability in addition his 
report must describe the extent to which any country signing the 
agreement maintains a noncommercial state trading enterprise 
that may impair us benefits 
the law is an omnibus to be sure adding new duties to the 
departments of agriculture commerce defense education labor 
state and treasury it involves the federal communications 
commission the general accounting office the office of management 
and budget and the small business administration 
under the guise of dealing with trade and competitiveness the 
statute responds to all sorts of pressure groups and personal 
curiosities of members of congress says weidenbaum 
in quite a few instances he adds it appears that congressional 
approval of new studies are little more than consolation prizes for 
members whose substantive legislative proposals were rejected 
the secretary of agriculture must study the market for lamb in 
the united states if appropriate the report should include 
proposals on ways to bring about a longterm increase in per capita 
consumption of lamb meat products 
the law concludes weidenbaum illustrates the unrestrained 
nature of congressional mandates at a time when national policy 
ostensibly is to focus on improving us efficiency and 
productivity 
he asks can the taxpayer expect the members of congress to 
read the detailed reports they require 
good question obvious answer if they were to be so industrious 
as to read these reports theyd have little time for anything else 
but maybe they should maybe thats the way to prevent more omnibus 
laws from getting passed

southern baptists and roman catholics the 
nations two largest denominations generally have been regarded as 
doctrinally far apart but their scholars find they basically agree 
despite varied terminology and some real differences we do 
share a basic understanding of what it means to be followers of 
jesus christ by the grace of god says their joint report 
after 10 years of periodic discussions the baptistcatholic 
dialogue group quoting ephesians 45 concludes we not only 
confessed but experienced one lord one faith and one baptism 
the 163page report is seen as the most fullscale mutual 
examination of respective positions of the two traditions achieving 
it was an unprecedented experience for southern baptists commonly 
averse to ecumenical affairs 
both sides admitted past unfairness toward each other with 
predominantly roman catholic countries discriminating against 
southern baptist missionaries and the latter laboring among 
catholics without respecting their faith 
such competition and conflict in missionary work can become 
a stumbling block to those who have not heard the gospel the 
dialogue team said 
its report was issued recently in a special issue of 
theological educator a journal of the new orleans baptist 
theological seminary and in a book called to understand each 
other published by paulist press 
the rev fisher humphreys a southern baptist theologian and 
participant in the dialogue said it was a rare process for his 
denomination which generally has shunned ecumenical efforts for 
christian unity 
the talks sponsored by the catholic bishops committee on 
ecumenical and interreligious affairs and the southern baptist 
department of interfaith witness involved 18 meetings beteen 1978 
and 1988 
there were about 20 participants in each meeting but due to 
turnover through the decade 39 people altogether took part a new 
set of meetings is to begin next march 
dealing with such topics as scripture salvation spirituality 
church and ministry grace missions and escatology end of time 
the team agreed that the ultimate authority and object of faith is 
the triune god father son and holy spirit 
participants concurred that the primary source of our knowledge 
of god is the bible which is the inspired word of god 
authoritative for faith and practice 
but the report notes that baptists while valuing past tradition 
in understanding the bible say tradition must be tested by 
scripture while catholics say interpretation of scripture must be 
measured by tradition 
the bible has always been the center of southern baptist 
life the report notes adding that since the reforming second 
vatican council of 196265 catholicism has also become strongly 
biblical 
on the central christian task the report says we all agree 
that the proclamation of the offer of salvation to all peoples is 
the prime mission of the church 
however the report says baptists stress the experience of 
salvation when in faith a person accepts jesus as personal 
savior while catholics stress the redemptive work of christ 
through faith and church sacraments 
we both set the highest priority on seeking a conscious 
relationship with god in this life and on striving for the ultimate 
goal of living in glory with god in heaven the report says 
we affirm that our love for god is best achieved in a close 
relationship with jesus coupled with a christlike love of 
neighbor 
noting that catholic devotion to mary and the saints has been a 
source of division and misunderstanding the report says 
while roman catholics affirm with baptists the sole 
mediatorship of christ they also honor the virgin mary as 
inseparably linked with her sons saving work and invoke her 
support in prayers 
baptists honor mary as the mother of jesus christ but 
consider the communion of saints as primarily a present reality 
among christians and dont pray to mary or deceased christians 
lest such infringe the sole mediatorship of jesus christ 
however great progress has been made in mutual understanding 
on this matter the report says with catholic devotion to mary 
undergoing significant change since the second vatican council 
seeing her more in biblical terms 
both southern baptists and roman catholics agree that salvation 
is gods free gift of grace unmerited by any human works or 
righteousness the report says 
the report says both baptists and catholics regard the church as 
the body of christ but baptists stress the individual 
congregation while catholics see the church in broader dimensions 
as the entire people of god 
catholic and baptist worship differs in tone and style 
catholic worship centering on liturgical prayers and holy communion 
while baptist worship centers on preaching singing and prayer the 
report says adding 
both groups have a strong sense both of human sinfulness and of 
gods love even amid our sins and failings both stress strong 
family life and sexual morality both stress active engagement in 
church life

repesentatives of two orthodox branches that 
split in the fifth century over presumed differences about the 
nature of christ have agreed on a joint statement of common faith 
the agreement developed by a joint commission was seen as 
overcoming a major obstacle to restoration of full communion between 
eastern and oriental orthodoxy after 1500 years of separation 
they divided in the fifth century when the orientals did not 
participate in the ecumenical council of chalcedon which defined 
two natures of christ divine and human orientals affirmed one 
united divinehuman nature 
the joint statement says those among us who speak of two 
natures in christ do not thereby deny their inseparable indivisible

colstrip mont spends 5148 per pupil the districts 
6yearold high school is flush with computers uptodate labs 
even a greenhouse and indoor pool 
this eastern montana district with a tax base enriched by the 
presence of four power plants offers high school pupils several 
foreign languages and such electives as zoology microbiology and 
geology 
superior in the western end of the state spends about 3000 
per pupil the newest school building is 28 years old there are no 
science electives beyond basic biology chemistry and physics in 
labs described as woefully inadequate by former superintendent 
william donahue 
indoor swimming pools or greenhouses like in colstrip 
those would be dreams said donahue 
such contrasts between rich and poor districts endemic to 
virtually every state put school finance at the top of the 
education reform agenda this past year 
as 43 million children prepare for a new school year an 
associated press survey found 11 states defending against lawsuits 
brought by parents or school districts challenging the 
constitutionality of school funding systems systems that critics 
have long held discriminate against those living in communities with 
lower property tax revenues 
while many people talk about the importance of educational 
reform children in lowwealth districts would be helped a lot just 
to be brought to where highspending districts now are said 
arthur wise a school finance expert at the rand corporation a 
washington thinktank 
states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning school 
finance are alaska connecticut indiana kentucky minnesota 
montana new jersey north dakota oregon tennessee and texas 
a coalition of poor alabama districts says it will probably sue 
that state this fall 
in florida 22 districts sued the state in 1986 the state won a 
summary judgment in 1987 
montana under court order since february to reform its funding 
system held a special legislative session this summer which 
boosted state education spending by 61 million but which critics 
say failed to solve the equity problems 
oklahoma legislators likewise have been meeting in special 
session this summer to consider sweeping proposals by gov henry 
bellmon that would substitute income and other taxes for much of the 
school property tax so far nothing has been decided 
the equity issue has reasserted itself in the school reform 
agenda this year for several reasons chiefly many state funding 
systems are simply outofdate formulated in the early 1970s during 
the last great wave of school finance reform 
in many states you have a finance system dating from the early 
1970s you still have that system in 1989 when the school 
expectations the demographics and the economics are all different 
you can take me to any state from michigan to iowa to montana and i 
could tell you that same story said kent mcguire who follows such 
money matters for the education commission of the states in denver 
and school reform with its mandates requiring rich and poor 
districts alike to fund smaller classes higher teacher pay and 
other costly measures has pushed many small taxpoor districts to 
their financial limits 
its clear that as the reform agenda moves on thats anted up 
the cost mcguire said 
in many states the school finance issue is pitting rural 
districts with poor tax bases against bigger wealthier ones with 
farm values declining and fewer children interested in pursuing 
agricultural careers the quality of schools in rural districts has 
become a more urgent concern 
in north dakota nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit 
in june claiming the states system of providing aid to schools is 
unconstitutional 
a school districts ability to finance eduction is unfairly and 
inequitably linked to its property wealth said calvin rolfson a 
bismarck attorney representing the plaintiffs 
in texas where a lawsuit brought by a group of smaller districts 
is pending before the state supreme court lead attorney al kauffman 
said they have no chemistry no physics no calculus foreign 
language prekindergarten or college prep no extracurricular no 
band choir football no debate they have 96 percent lowincome 
students those students are not being given a chance in this 
society 
weve managed to just squeak by year after year said antonio 
parra a spokesman for the san elizario school district but 
taxpayers in our school district will probably face another tax 
increase how long can you stretch a rubber band 
in connecticut oregon and new jersey by contrast the poor 
children suing the state live in metro areas 
the nonprofit education law center in a suit on behalf of 20 
schoolaged children in camden irvington east orange and jersey 
city nj won its first victory last summer when administrative 
law judge steven lefelt ruled that the 1975 state formula for 
funding public education has failed and is unconstitutional 
in a scathing ruling lefelt found that poorer urban districts 
are overcrowded have fewer teachers poor equipment decaying 
buildings and more limited course offerings than wealthy suburban 
districts 
state education commissioner saul cooperman has rejected those 
findings as has gov thomas h kean who dismissed lefelts ruling 
as an interesting liberal treatise the state supreme court is 
scheduled to hear arguments sept 25 
in connecticut where the state is being sued by a group of urban 
schoolchildren and parents assistant superintendent daniel shamas 
in bridgeport said his district fights a constant budget battle 
bridgeport spends 5431 per year on each of its 19270 students 
affluent westport just 10 miles away spends 8299 per pupil 
if you look at the state as a whole you see two 
connecticuts one rich and one poor shamas said if you look at 
what were spending per pupil and what other more wealthy towns 
are spending that tells the whole story 
westport schools comptroller frederick j nigri rejects the 
argument that rich and poor towns offer substantially different 
educational opportunities 
for the basic educational program a child can get a great deal 
out of a bigcity system if theyre motivated nigri said we 
may have some better enrichment programs perhaps a little better 
drama program but i like to think theres some education equality 
while not yet the subject of a lawsuit in michigan school 
finance has become one of that states thorniest issues after 
failing to solve the problem the legislature has placed two 
competing referendums for voters to decide in november one would 
raise some 400 million in school funds with a sales tax hike the 
other would hike sales taxes by 468 million but offer 13 billion 
in propertytax relief 
there has never been a time that ive been told by the 
districts and educators that weve provided enough money said ken 
nelson a legislator in minnesota where 48 school districts have 
filed suit claiming that states funding formula is unfair nobody 
knows what really is enough money thats a judgment call

julie sommars plays both andy griffiths 
courtroom adversary and his love interest in nbcs matlock 
im frequently the prosecutor going up against defense attorney 
matlock so that makes me the loser of the week sommars said 
im the modernday hamilton burger who was defeated every week by 
perry mason 
andy said we have to have a show where i win a case 
actually i did win once matlock was accused of jury tampering i 
quit my job with the district attorneys office and defended him i 
was wonderful and he got off 
sommars made a guest appearance on the show near the end of the 
first season in 1987 it was to be a onetime appearance but she 
did a second episode that season and was put under contract as a 
recurring character at the opening of the second season 
battling lovers is an old dramatic custom that shakespeare used 
and that spencer tracy and katharine hepburn honed to perfection in 
their movies griffith as ben matlock and sommars as julie march 
generally confine their confrontations to the courtroom 
andy writes most of our scenes together which is why they work 
so well she said he wants our relationship to be entertaining 
but he also wants it to be mature and grownup he makes it work and 
thats why they keep asking me back 
we cant do what they do in la law we cant jump into the 
shower it has to be a relationship this is an eight oclock show 
when you have two people talking together yet you have to show 
love thats very hard to write i dont know if theyve ever been 
to bed but i think they have and thats the way i play it i dont 
know if andys playing it that way 
although matlock generally runs second to abcs comedy block 
it was 14th in the ratings for the 198889 season it leads off 
nbcs tuesday night schedule and is followed by in the heat of the 
night and midnight caller 
sommars celebrates her 30th year in show business this year but 
matlock is only her second series 
she costarred with dan dailey as his daughter in the governor 
and jj from 1969 to 72 she won a golden globe as best actress 
in a comedy series in 1969 for the role 
i came here right out of high school in aberdeen sd and the 
very first thing i did was on the loretta young show she said 
i played her daughter i had no wardrobe of my own but it turned 
out loretta young and i were the exact same size she let me wear 
some of her wardrobe the hairdresser said she must like you 
shes never done that before 
i wore a pair of her earrings and on the first day she came by 
and told me to take good care of them because they were emeralds 
any time i wasnt on camera i had my hands on my ears to protect the 
earrings loretta young saw me and said i was only kidding 
theyre not really emeralds i just wanted to impress upon you not 
to believe everything people tell you in this business i wish id 
taken her advice 
sommars said a guest spot on man from uncle led to a 
role in the feature film the pad and to the governor and 
jj one of the writers on uncle was dean hargrove 
coexecutive producer of matlock 
shes married to an attorney and has a 16yearold daughter from 
a previous marriage and two stepchildren 
a recurring role is great for me she said its nice to be 
part of a series family but its also nice not to have to go to work 
every day andy is the hardestworking actor ive ever known he not 
only knows his lines he knows your lines too 
betty davis is like that too we were on an episode of 
gunsmoke i was the sweet young thing and she was the mean ranch 
owner i was the low man on the totem pole so they did my closeups 
last theyd tell her she could leave but she always stayed to read 
her lines offcamera to me

when adolf hitlers troops crossed into the 
stubble fields of western poland on sept 1 1939 the new york 
worlds fair was beguiling visitors with its vision of the world 
of tomorrow 
now 50 years later the america you see around you may not bear 
much resemblance to some of the predictions of that exposition in 
flushing meadows but it was shaped irreversibly by the world 
conflagration touched off in poland 
the fair demonstrated that television pictures could be 
transmitted not only in the new york metropolitan area but to 
viewers all of 130 miles away there were other glimpses of the 
future some accurate and some not 
but as the new york times observed in an editorial the world of 
tomorrow still had a great deal of unfinished business in it 
in baltimore the young poet karl shapiro observed a robbery in 
his neighborhood an unheard of thing an augury of things to come 
after the war 
the war to americans of shapiros generation the words would 
mean only one thing world war ii 
when it started america was a nation of 132 million people 
struggling out of the great depression it had an army of 189839 
men including the air corps and a navy of 125202 the federal 
government employed a civilian work force of 905000 
except for the wealthy and a handful of expatriate artists few 
americans went abroad republican alf landon warning in that last 
prewar summer against being drawn into the balanceofpower 
game in europe said never has there been a more urgent call to 
be americans first last and all the time 
looking back at that time roger beaumont a texas aampm military 
historian on leave to teach at the us naval academy said in a 
recent interview there was a long period of the united states 
having a very weak willingness to be involved in world affairs 
except during that very tiny moment during world war i when the 
united states lunged onto the stage and then looked kind of 
bewildered and jumped back off again 
weve got a completely different history behind us now 
beaumont said 
what a history pearl harbor bataan rosie the riveter the 
marshall plan the cold war vietnam radar computers the atomic 
bomb 
for most people my age the war and its aftermath were the most 
intense experience of our lives telford taylor chief american 
prosecutor at 12 of the 13 nuremberg war crimes trials told oral 
historian studs turkel 
by the time the war ended 293986 americans would have died in 
combat nearly as many as the total enlistment in the army and navy 
in 1939 
today in a nation of 247 million people more than 21 million 
americans wear their countrys uniform and 31 million work for the 
federal government as civilians the latest commerce department 
figures for a 12month period show 144 million americans traveling 
abroad not including trips to canada and mexico the nation enjoys 
unprecedented affluence but its cities are beset by crime and drugs 
when war came millions of people were itching to get to 
work said beaumont the war gave them a chance to get to 
work many of the millions were women when peace returned many 
kept on working the census bureau says 11178000 women 14 and 
older were employed in 1939 in 1989 counting only those 16 and 
older the figure is 52997000 
in world affairs an america that had been reluctant to get 
involved emerged from the war to find itself a superpower confronted 
by another in korea in vietnam in the middle east in europe it 
would be involved as never before 
television signals bouncing off satellites in space bring live 
pictures of turmoil abroad into american living rooms the radar 
screens perfected during world war ii to track enemy ships and 
planes now catch speeders on the interstate highway system itself a 
legacy of dwight eisenhower world war ii general turned president 
in the popular futurama exhibit at the new york worlds fair 
architect norman bel geddes predicted an america fueled chiefly by 
liquid air atomic energy would have only a minor role the bombs 
dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki changed all that 
as the war began president franklin d roosevelts isolationist 
ambassador to great britain joseph p kennedy harbored hopes that 
his eldest son would enter politics and perhaps become president 
but in the summer of 1944 lt joseph p kennedy jr was killed when 
his navy plane exploded over the english channel 
it would be john f kennedy the ambassadors second son who 
would succeed the wartime hero eisenhower as president jfk whose 
father had opposed aid to england and said the war in europe was not 
our fight would proclaim in his inaugural address that 
americans were unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of 
those human rights to which this nation has always been committed 
and to which we are committed today at home and around the world 
the vision of the united states as a world policeman would come 
under attack as the war in vietnam deepened and in succeeding years 
public opinion polls would show disenchantment with it 
nevertheless few believe that america will ever return to the kind 
of isolationism that prevailed in the 1930s 
the change in america says historian beaumont is a huge 
complex phenomenon which is almost equivalent to the waves of 
immigration that had gone on to settle america from europe 
thats an academic talking the poet shapiro now 75 and writing 
his memoirs puts it more succinctly speaking of himself and his 
friends in the baltimore of 1939 he writes 
the war was hanging over their heads like a cobra ready to 
strike

rain man mgm home video vhsbeta 7995 rated r 
 
rain man barry levinsons compelling drama about an autistic 
savant and his hustler brother won the academy award for best 
picture of 1988 by beating out one of the decades most original and 
artistic gems who framed roger rabbit 
where the innovative and fresh roger rabbit was a movie best 
seen on the large screen with dolby sound rain man is in many 
respects ordinary and more comfortable on the home screen and 
without the star presence of dustin hoffman and tom cruise thats 
exactly where the movie would have been launched on television 
cruise is the slick younger brother who kidnaps his 
institutionalized sibling to fight a will after using him at the 
blackjack tables in las vegas he begins to understand his brother 
becomes protective and forges a relationship 
hoffman gives an excellent performance as the autistic older 
brother who has an uncanny talent for computing numbers storing 
baseball statistics and recalling isolated and esoteric facts such 
as qantas being the only airline never to have suffered a crash at 
times though he comes on like a grownup benjamin braddock the 
graduate fumbling troubled raging 
similar performances by peter sellers as the illiterate gardener 
in being there and cliff robertson as the retarded genius in 
charly somehow evoked more pathos but tiptoed around the laughs 
levinson managed to squeeze out of the inspired script by ronald 
bass and barry morrow based on morrows story 
rain man is a nice little movie almost tailormade for home

homes and businesses because of the states size and the research 
behind the proposal the california plan is likely to be examined 
closely by states that havent made major changes analysts said

economists say that signs of resurgent economic 
growth likely will mean that federal reserve policymakers will not 
continue their summertime push to lower interest rates 
bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets said monday he 
doesnt expect central bank officials to do much of anything 
during private meetings this week 
economists believe the fed is unlikely to make another move on 
interest rates until it gets new evidence of further softness in 
economic growth or another spurt of inflation

the federal reserve board has given citicorp 
permission to more closely coordinate its savings and loan 
subsidiaries in california illinois and florida with its banking 
operation 
the central bank as directed by savings and loan legislation 
signed by president bush on aug 9 lifted previous restrictions 
monday that had prevented citicorp the nations largest banking 
company from operating the thrifts in tandem with its 
commercial banks 
the restrictions were designed to prevent bank holding companies 
from buying up sampls in states where they would otherwise be 
restricted under interstate banking prohibitions from buying 
commercial banks 
but as part of an effort to attract more capital to the thrift 
industry congress decided to permit bank holding companies for the 
first time to buy healthy sampls and run them without the operating 
restrictions 
in a related action the fed lifted the tandem restriction 
imposed on michigan national corps operation of beverly hills 
federal savings bank 
citicorp and michigan national were the only two bank holding 
companies that owned thrifts subject to the restriction

california often a trendsetter could influence 
the way other states set local phone rates by moving ahead with its 
plan for partial rate decontrol analysts say 
the california plan is designed to speed up rate decisions while 
giving phone companies an incentive to cut costs and introduce new 
services state regulators will vote on it next month 
the states size the thoroughness of its 350page plan and its 
reputation as a source of new ideas all could help make its 
ratesetting proposal a model for other states say analysts 
in a way california was embarrassed a few years ago because 
other states had started moving in this direction and it hadnt 
robert morris iii an analyst at goldman sachs amp co in san 
francisco said monday but theres a benefit in being late in 
that theyve been able to pick and choose from what the other states 
have done 
vermont and nebraska have almost totally deregulated local phone 
rates while states such as florida iowa and new jersey have 
introduced some freemarket features to their ratesetting 
mechanisms texas at the other extreme still has a conventional 
rateofreturn system massachusetts and illinois are exploring 
changes now morris said 
in all about 30 states have taken at least small steps away from 
traditional ratesetting methods at least in small ways new york 
is planning to take another look at a modified ratesetting method 
that has not worked as intended said eli noam a member of new 
yorks public service commission 
a proposal by an administrative law judge that was made last week 
to californias public utilities commission combines features of 
plans that have been tried elsewhere at the state and national 
level the commission is expected to approve the plan possibly with 
modifications next month 
the plan represents a compromise among the state regulatory 
staff consumer advocates and the states two biggest phone 
companies pacific bell and gte california 
the plan would give the two phone companies a profit incentive to 
be efficient by allowing them to keep half the profits they make 
above a benchmark 1275 percent rate of return on assets above a 
1675 percent return all profits would go back to ratepayers 
in traditional ratesetting methods all profits above the 
benchmark go back to ratepayers that has tended to discourage 
efficiency and encourage goldplating spending excessively to 
increase the asset base and thus increase total allowable profits 
the plan assumes that phone companies will be able to achieve 4 
percent improvements in productivity each year so that if the 
inflation rate were zero they would be required to cut rates by 4 
percent if inflation hit 5 percent they would be allowed a 1 
percent rate increase 
that is a higher standard than the 3 percent imposed by the 
federal communications comission on american telephone amp telegraph 
co earlier this year when atampt was given a pricecap ratesetting 
mechanism 
still it is lower than the 6 percent standard some california 
consumer advocates had sought 
the 4 percent productivity standard is tough but probably 
achievable officials of san franciscobased pacific telesis group 
the parent of pacific bell told security analysts monday at a new 
york briefing 
that is definitely a hurdle it will definitely create 
challenges for management and the company executive vice 
president gary mcbee said 
there are a lot of people who are nervous about 4 percent 
mcbee said later in an interview 
if californias economy stays as strong as its been we ought 
to be able to manage that as long as we manage our business well 
george f schmitt vice president for state regulatory affairs said 
in an interview i dont like it but i dont know what the heck to 
do about it 
in addition to pricing flexibility pacific bell would be given 
the right to spend more than 400 million to replace outdated 
switches that relay calls one switch in mojave calif was 
installed in 1934 schmitt said 
this is what we consider a real winwin decision for all the 
major parties said lap lee a salomon brothers inc analyst 
if it really is winwin it is bound to be copied by other states 
where the issue of phone rates is loselose politically 
there are a lot of regulatory bodies that would like to get out 
of the pervasive regulation business said peter bernstein a 
senior analyst at probe research inc in cedar knolls nj

a japanese pharmaceutical maker that owns 30 
percent of lyphomed inc has launched a 649 million takeover bid 
for the drug maker which has suffered qualitycontrol problems but 
gained fame for its drug used to treat aidsrelated pneumonia 
fujisawa pharmaceuticals co has offered 31 per share for the 
stock of the suburban rosemontbased drug company it does not own 
lyphomed announced monday 
industry analysts said the move would give fujisawa the largest 
us presence of any japanese drug maker 
this gives fujisawa a bettertrained sales force and 
increases their visibility in the united states said leonard 
yaffe a health care analyst with montgomery securities in san 
francisco it makes a ton of sense 
john n kapoor lyphomeds chairman and founder has agreed to 
sell his 14 percent stake in the generic drug company to the suitor 
if lyphomeds board approves the deal a company said 
fujisawa has been a stockholder for a long time lyphomed 
spokeswoman melissa marsden said we have had a friendly 
relationship with them and we have some projects under joint 
development 
news of fujisawas offer sent lyphomed stock soaring 775 a 
share to close at 3025 monday in heavy overthecounter trading 
fujisawa has owned 30 percent of lyphomed about 9 million of 
the companys 299 million outstanding shares since october 1986 
ms marsden said 
but an agreement with lyphomed requires board approval if 
fujisawa based in osaka japan wants to buy more than 301 percent 
of the stock before jan 11 1991 
the offer was presented to lyphomed over the weekend ms marsden 
said she said lyphomed was consulting with financial advisers and 
considering the proposal 
the company rose to national prominence for its sales of 
pentamidine a drug used to treat aidsrelated pneumonia company 
sales soared from 4 million in 1981 to 172 million in 1987 
but qualitycontrol violations discovered by the federal food and 
drug administration at several lyphomed plants soured the companys 
financial performance and lyphomed lost 211 million in 1988 
lyphomed has since shuffled top management and ms marsden said 
the proposed buyout was not connected with lyphomeds troubles 
for the first six months of 1989 lyphomed posted a profit of 
105000 on revenue of 717 million 
meanwhile lyphomed said monday that the fda had approved 
production at the companys plant in canovanas puerto rico 
lyphomed plans to manufacture pentamidine antibiotics and 
cardiovascular drugs there 
tetsuro nuki chief executive of fujisawasmithkline corp a 
whollyowned philadelphiabased subsidiary of the japanese company 
said fujisawa was not concerned about lyphomeds quality control 
fujisawa believes lyphomed has already cleared up that issue 
nuki said we dont see any problem at this point 
fujisawa had sales of 156 billion in 1988 ms marsden said 
michael harshbarger an industry analyst at hayes and griffith a 
chicago firm that specializes in healthcare investments said that 
with the support of kapoor who shepherded the company through its 
success it was unlikely the lyphomed board would reject the deal 
harshbarger said the deal would give fujisawa the largest us 
presence of any japanese pharmaceutical company 
i think its part of fujisawas overall strategic plan they 
want to become the first japanese company to stake out a major part 
of the us market harshbarger said

though the monsanto chemical co plant 
here sports a new device to scrub pollutants from its emissions 
company officials say thats not enough to reach their goal of a 90 
percent reduction in air discharges 
monsanto like a growing number of companies says it now must 
concentrate on reducing pollutants before they come out of its 
plants by using and producing less toxic materials in the first 
place 
this is the wave of the future the whole notion of preventing 
pollution rather than continually seeing ourselves in the position 
of having to clean it up said margie alt toxics program director 
for the massachusetts public interest research group 
massachusetts and oregon passed laws last month requiring 
industries to work to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals they use 
similar bills are being pushed in the legislatures of california and 
new jersey 
the challenge says greenpeace toxics campaign director dave 
rapaport is not disposal but how not to generate waste in the 
first place 
noting that waste reduction makes good economic sense in a time 
of soaring disposal costs companies like monsanto say theyre 
already doing the best they can to use and make less hazardous 
materials 
monsanto has declared a goal of reducing air emissions by 90 
percent by 1992 and solid waste by 70 percent by 1995 du pont 
quickly followed suit announcing its own ambitious waste reduction 
goals 
it is the idea of mandatory governmentordered steps that irks 
the petrochemical plants that line the delaware river south of 
philadelphia 
chemists and plant managers are wary of legislators forcing them 
to tinker with the delicate reactions and processes that produce 
everything from pharmaceuticals to vinyl floor coverings 
the monsanto bridgeport plant makes plasticizers basic 
building blocks for a host of products they are made from benzyl 
chloride the fruit of a chemical reaction between toluene and 
chlorine hazardous substances that are mixed in a vacuum chamber in 
precise amounts 
besides the desired product the process yields an unwanted toxic 
residue 
believe me weve been working very hard to reduce that said 
donald hoegel a monsanto environmental specialist we really 
dont want to make it but its very hard not to 
so far monsanto chemists havent figured out a way yet under a 
bill pending in the new jersey legislature the state would not 
accept no for an answer anymore the proposal would force the 
states industries to reduce their use of hazardous materials and 
production of hazardous waste by 50 percent over five years 
the california legislature meanwhile is considering a bill to 
require industries to develop sourcereduction plans to help 
legislators propose establishment of a hazardous waste reduction 
institute in the states university system 
the massachusetts bill passed with onesided votes after a rare 
bit of cooperation between the environmental community and a 
business coalition 
there are a lot of companies that want to get ahead of 
environmental issues and not just react to them said jim segal a 
lawyer and former state legislator who represented the business 
coalition 
but at the monsanto plant here which produces less than one 
unit of waste for every 100 units of product reducing toxic 
byproducts by half in a few years could prove impossible hoegel 
says 
its very hard to dictate a fixed number for reduction because 
its very much dependent on the chemical process itself he said 
if youre already very efficient to get that extra little bit out 
may be absolutely infeasible 
in the case of pharmaceutical makers allimportant us food and 
drug administration approval hinges on a products precise 
chemistry altering the process to make less waste may harmfully 
alter the product said hal bozarth a lobbyist for new jerseys 
powerful chemical industry 
but environmental leaders in new jersey say it isnt good enough 
to trust industrys pace or good intentions 
its great that some companies out there are pursuing toxics 
reduction aggressively but without legislation theres no way 
youre going to make this happen in a comprehensive manner said 
lincoln bormann environmental advocate for new jersey pirg 
bormann says its hardly a coincidence that shellfish from the 
industryheavy lower delaware are unfit for human consumption 
decades of industrial discharges have left sediments laden with 
chemicals and altered the mix of plants and animals in the river 
while monsanto may be setting a goal there are a lot of 
companies that arent he said i think the fact new jersey has 
the worst water quality in the country speaks for itself

the philadelphia and american exchanges have 
limited trading on their new stock basket products while 
denouncing a chicago federal court ruling that has thrown the 
products legitimacy into question 
the real loser in this controversy is the american investor 
said kenneth leibler president of the american stock exchange 
the exchanges began offering stock baskets to investors three 
months ago 
philadelphia stock exchange president nicholas a giordano said 
the friday decision by the 7th us circuit court of appeals was a 
major step backward in the regulation and development of innovative 
new products 
stock baskets are financial innovations priced to reflect changes 
in broad market indexes such as the standard amp poors 500stock 
index investors receive quarterly cash payments equal to a 
proportionate share of any regular cash dividend declared on the 
stocks in the index 
the exchanges said trading in stock baskets would be largely 
restricted to liquidation meaning holders would be able to sell 
them for cash market makers at the exchanges are obligated to buy 
them if no other buyers emerge ensuring an orderly market and 
preventing panic selling 
the uncertainty over stock baskets was raised friday by the 
chicago court which ruled that such products resemble commodity 
futures such as those for pork bellies and grain and should be 
monitored by the commodity futures trading commission not the 
securities and exchange commission 
the philadelphia and american exchanges began trading may 12 on 
stock baskets after receiving approval from the sec 
the philadelphia exchange calls its product a cash index 
participation and the amex calls its product an equity index 
participation 
the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
had asked the sec to delay trading on the baskets saying they were 
thinly disguised stock index futures that must be approved by the 
cftc 
when the sec refused the two futures exchanges appealed the 
decision to the 7th circuit court which agreed with them 
the sec said in a statement it had not had a chance to review the 
decision and thus had no comment 
a cftc spokesman said in a statement we believed that they 
were futures contracts when they were initially submitted and we 
are pleased to find the court agrees with our interpretation 
the new york stock exchange is planning to introduce its own 
basket but nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin predicted it would not be 
affected by the appeals court ruling 
our product is very different from theirs she said the 
index participation baskets only represented an index of stocks 
with ours you are actually buying the stocks themselves and there 
is actual ownership 
the basket known as the exchange stock portfolio is still 
awaiting sec approval but the exchange hopes to begin offering it 
around the end of september ms gamsin said 
the philadelphia exchange is exploring what strategy to take as a 
result of the courts decision giordano said but he predicted 
federal legislation would be needed to resolve the question 
the real loser here is the individual investor for whom cash 
index participants were originally designed giordano said 
the regulation of cips as futures would dramatically diminish 
their potential distribution to individual investors and effectively 
nullify their potential to allow individuals to compete in financial 
markets dominated by institutions giordano said

kroger co one of the nations largest 
supermarket chains has denied a television reports claim that it 
knowingly sold adulterated orange juice produced by a chicago 
company 
cbs news reported monday that a series of kroger memos from 1979 
to 1982 indicate the company continued to sell as 100 percent pure 
orange juice a product bought from bodines inc despite laboratory 
tests showing the juice was tainted 
a federal grand jury in chicago indicted two former owners and a 
top executive of the nowdefunct bodines july 25 on charges the 
company sold orange juice concentrate from 1978 to 1985 that 
contained waste water and illegal additives such as beet sugar 
kroger spokesman paul bernish denied that the grocer knowingly 
sold the adulterated juice and said kroger repeatedly sought and 
received written quality assurances from bodines 
bernish said the chicago indictment would show that bodines 
lied to its customers including kroger and provided explanations 
that satisfied us but seen in retrospect were part of a pattern of 
apparent deception that was used against us 
cincinnatibased kroger owns supermarkets convenience stores and 
foodprocessing plants in 32 states bernish said kroger sold 
bodines orange juice from 1979 to 1985 under the grocery chains 
cost cutter and avondale brand names 
the us attorneys office in chicago said consumers who drank 
the orange juice were not at risk because of the additives but one 
person suffered a negative reaction to the sugar in a can of juice 
bernish said a federal grand jury in cincinnati has convened to 
investigate the case 
cbs said a series of kroger memos from company employees 
recommended the grocer stop using bodines juice because of the 
impurities but kroger continued to sell it because bodines charged 
less than market price saving the grocer 2 million annually 
according to the broadcast 
bernish said the company bought bodines orange juice because the 
company charged less than other generic suppliers he said kroger 
asked the us food and drug administration to test the orange 
juice but the fda reported there were no tests that could confirm 
the products purity 
bernish said that after the company developed its own tests for 
orange juice it discovered results that seemed to be a problem 
after the tests and the 1983 discovery of excessive preservatives 
in some juice kroger sought and received written guarantees of 
purity from bodines bernish said 
the broadcast quoted a kroger lawyer it did not identify as

bingo once a quaint game played in church 
basements and fraternal clubs has become such a big business in 
north dakota that one city has started cracking down on bingo 
parlors 
bingo is the fastest growing of a variety of games of chance that 
the state has allowed charitable organizations to run in the past 
decade but there is some concern that gaming has encouraged 
problems ranging from cheating and theft to excessive gambling 
the bingo action attracts players like merrlyn meland a 
58yearold widow from moorhead minn just across the state line 
from fargo she comes to fargo three or four times a week for the 
prospect of big money prizes and companionship 
i think a lot of it is just to get away from the house she 
said during a recent session i cant stand being around that 
place i have to get out where theres people 
meland finds plenty of company at big top and prairie public 
broadcasting which operate the largest of fargos five bustling 
bingo parlors 
prairie public the network for the states public radio and 
television stations has had as many as 490 people playing in its 
modern facility which sports electronic scoreboards and video 
monitors prairie public uses the funds from its gambling operations 
to run its broadcasting operations 
bingo raffles and pull tabs a paper simulation of a slot 
machine were the first games introduced 12 years ago after north 
dakota allowed gambling for charitable purposes 
since then sports pools parimutuel horse racing blackjack 
poker and video poker have been legalized ironically voters have 
rejected a proposed lottery 
in june 327 organizations held gambling licenses at 576 sites 
across the state state regulations list more than 100 ways 
charitable gambling proceeds may be used including broad categories 
of educational religious and fraternal activities eligible uses 
also include a category called other 
among the organizations supported by bingo or other gambling 
revenues are bishop ryan high school in minot a roman catholic 
school the red river dance and performing company in fargo and the 
souris valley humane society 
overall gamblers wagered a record 205 million last year with 
18 million going to charitable groups the state also gets a cut 
with taxes ranging up to 15 percent of revenues and sales tax 
charged on bingo cards and some other gaming items 
the revenue is welcome in a state with a troubled farm economy 
but there are also worries that gambling has brought other problems 
to the state 
recently the grand forks city council voted to limit the number 
of bingo parlors 
bingo in fact is large gambling and gambling is not like any 
other business councilwoman gwen crawford said 
social problems are evident in the number of groups like gamblers 
anonymous said nicholas spaeth the states attorney general 
ten years ago you couldnt open up a newspaper in the state 
and find such a group he said but now there isnt a major city 
in the state that doesnt have one 
cheating and theft also have been a problem although how much 
goes on is hard to determine spaeth said 
still bingo is still accepted in most places outside of grand 
forks 
charities operating the games dont express any qualms that they 
may be encouraging excessive gambling spaeth said he expects the 
bingo business which grew 28 percent in 1988 to a total of 411 
million to keep growing 
its the lure of the big jackpot that draws people in he 
said 
prairie public the biggest bingo operator with revenues of 
nearly 85 million last year offers nightly prizes that include a 
car and a 20000 payout to anyone who blacks out a card in 50 
numbers or fewer 
players can call 24hour bingo hotlines that give a rundown of 
the days biggest prize offerings 
melands winnings have included a 1300 prize and a trip to las 
vegas 
its fun to win but im not like some people who are hooked on 
it she said 
bingo is nearly a 24hour activity at big top run by the plains 
art museum in moorhead 
six days a week it offers a morning brunch bingo two afternoon 
matinees evening and moonlight sessions and on weekends 
redeye bingo that runs until 4 am said sue haaland the 
museums gambling manager 
i find a parking lot of a bingo facility rather interesting 
haaland said you see everything from fords to saabs in most lots 
we have people from all socioeconomic groups playing 
the large number of halls in fargo is a good thing haaland said 
its absolutely great for the bingo player she said and i 
believe the competition has been good for the organizations too it 
keeps them sharp and makes us all run a good honest game

a hot fiveyear car and truck selling pace has 
not stemmed the decline in profits for us dealerships and 10 
percent of them may be out of business next year the national 
automobile dealers association says 
nada said monday in a report received in detroit profits have 
dropped from 24 percent of total dealership sales in 1984 to 17 
percent last year the report forecast a continuing trend 
the steady decline in dealership profits concerns all dealers 
especially in light of the record profits the manufacturers have had 
in recent years nada president ron tonkin said 
however general motors corp and ford motor co last month 
reported their secondquarter earnings were down 34 percent and 
154 percent respectively compared with the second quarter of 
1988 chrysler corp profits were 66 percent higher than the 
quarter last year 
the nada which represents 20000 businesses holding more than 
41000 separate car and truck franchises forecast a decline in the 
number of dealerships in the next two years 
the study said some large highly leveraged dealerships in 
metropolitan areas have gone out of business and nada expects 
more such failures to occur in the near term 
the declining profitability of dealerships comes amid forecasts 
of a weaker car and truck selling market ahead each of the big 
three automakers has estimated vehicle sales for this year to be 
around 1 million units fewer than last years 158 million the 
secondbest year in history 
the nada originally forecast sales of 15 million cars and trucks 
for 1989 but has reduced that to 145 million 
the report said dealership parts departments showed an increase 
in profits but other aspects of the business including new vehicle 
sales and service showed falling profits

hal inc stock declined further in early trading 
today on the news that investors including former baseball 
commissioner peter v ueberroth would buy control of the parent 
company of troubled hawaiian airlines for far less than the market 
price 
hals board of directors unanimously accepted a tender offer of 
22 a share from the group headed by j thomas talbot a former 
airline executive from newport beach calif investors include 
ueberroth and his brother john 
last spring talbot and peter ueberroth headed a group that 
unsuccessfully bid 464 million for strikebound eastern airlines 
hal stock was down 87 cents at 2437 a share in early american 
stock exchange trading today the stock which has been boosted in 
recent months by takeover rumors fell 637 a share on monday in 
heavy trading 
a source close to the deal who asked not to be identified said 
talbot and peter ueberroth were equal partners in the buyout and 
that talbot would likely become chief executive officer and 
ueberroth cochairman of the company 
the group plans to buy at least 51 percent of hals stock at 22 
a share it could purchase a majority of the companys 195 million 
outstanding shares of common stock for about 219 million 
honolulu stockbroker randy havre of jb havre securities inc 
said the offer was reasonable and estimated the stocks true value 
at 15 to 20 a share 
the bottom line is the employees are going to win on this 
because theyre getting new management which will reduce the 
instability caused by financial losses over the past few years 
said havre 
john h magoon jr chairman and chief executive officer of hal 
owns about 57 percent of the company an airline spokesman said 
monday that magoon would sell enough of his shares to ensure the 
deal but he was expected to stay on as chairman or cochairman 
hal lost 13 million in the first half of this year and has lost 
a total of 306 million over the past 2 years 
last year a subsidiary of japan air lines paid almost 20 
million for a 20 percent stake in the company 
in a critical article in june forbes magazine blamed magoon for 
the airlines poor performance during an economic boom saying he 
has managed to run the states leading carrier almost into the 
ground 
hawaiian consistently has ranked among the industrys leaders in 
consumer complaints compiled by the us department of 
transportation 
last week john ueberroth witnessed such discontent when his los 
angelesbound hawaiian flight departed four hours late sources said 
talbot acknowledged the airlines problems but said his group 
would solve them by infusing the company with capital to buy better 
planes and equipment 
the investors who were attracted by the airlines routes in the 
pacific basin also said they would boost hawaiians image by 
improving and expanding service and sticking to schedules he said 
performance is the key and making sure we operate on timely 
schedules will be a top priority he said these changes wont 
happen overnight but they will happen 
the 60yearold airline is the states largest interisland 
carrier it also serves los angeles san francisco seattle las 
vegas alaska australia new zealand american samoa guam tahiti 
and other pacific points its 31 planes carried 55 million 
passengers last year 
after graduating from san jose state college in california in 
1959 ueberroth worked here for trans international airlines as an 
operations manager and vice president through 1962 
he has earned a reputation in professional baseball and as head 
of the olympics for turning problem enterprises into moneymakers 
the tender offer must clear several hurdles including the 
airlines unions several government agencies and the companys 
shareholders hal said

bid from vitro sa 
anchor also said it was exploring alternatives to the unsolicited 
20pershare offer from the mexican manufacturer 
anchor the countrys secondlargest glass maker behind corning 
glass works said the boards unanimous decision to reject the vitro 
offer was based in part on an opinion from its financial adviser 
morgan stanley amp co inc 
the board also adopted a poison pill shareholder rights plan 
that would make a hostile takeover of the company prohibitively 
expensive 
the plan provides for anchor stockholders to buy additional 
shares at a steep discount driving up the cost of a buyout 
anchor chairman vincent j naimoli in a letter to shareholders 
said the plan was intended to protect the interests of stockholders 
in light of the vitro offer 
it was not intended to prevent an acquisition of the company that 
would be in shareholders best interests he said 
vitro has called anchor a struggling company that cannot control 
its future and claimed anchors plants needed upgrading anchor 
denied vitros claims 
vitro has said it wants to merge anchor with its latchford glass

the nations oldest operating distillery has 
filed for bankruptcy court protection apparently thwarting an 
attempt by a bank seeking to recover 585000 gallons of whiskey it 
owns 
michters distillery owned by aquarii holding co of delaware 
and its subsidiary pennsylvania sour mash distilleries inc filed 
on friday for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
act that section of the law frees the company from creditors 
lawsuits until it can develop a plan to put its finances in order 
the action came three days before before the company was 
scheduled to appear monday in lebanon county common pleas court for 
a hearing on a dispute with commonwealth national bank over more 
than 6000 barrels of whiskey 
the bank which loaned 48 million to the distillerys former 
owner td veru seized the whiskey and other assets when that 
company declared bankruptcy 
in 1987 the bank sold the distillery to aquarii but retained 
ownership of the rye corn bourbon and sourmash whiskey valued at 
842000 a dispute over insurance for the whiskey caused the 
company to ban the bank from the distillery 
the bank later agreed to insure the whiskey and pay nearly 
62000 in back taxes but the distillery would not allow the bank 
to remove or sample the liquor until the tax was paid 
the bank was trying to negotiate with the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms to reduce the tax 
under a court order in june the bank was allowed to sample the 
whiskey which remains stored at the distillery 
michters was established in 1753 and continues to operate

a group of 46 japanese set sail tuesday to visit the 
graves of their ancestors on a sovietheld island off northern 
japan an official said 
it was the first grave visit in 19 years by japanese to kunashiri 
island one of japans northern territories said hirotoshi 
kawata an official in the city of nemuro 
the visits were suspended in 1970 partly because of a soviet 
requirement that japanese obtain soviet visas before traveling 
there kawata said 
the issue of the kuril islands has been a major stumbling block 
in relations between japan and the soviet union with japan claiming 
sovereignty over them and moscow saying a dispute does not exist 
the problem has prevented the countries from concluding a peace 
treaty formally terminating their hostilities in world war ii 
the visit to kunashiri came after then foreign minister sousuke 
uno and soviet officials agreed in may that japanese be allowed to 
go to the sovietheld island without visas or passports kawata said 
about 17000 japanese lived on the northern islands including 
7300 on kunashiri before they were forced to leave when soviet 
forces took over in 1945 
the group will land at yuzhnokurilsk a port on kunashiri to 
hold a memorial service for their ancestors and return home 
wednesday kawata said 
another group of japanese will make a fourday grave visit to the 
islands of shiotan taraku and shibotru all small islands near 
kunashiri beginning thursday kawata said

the environmental protection agency began 
filing lawsuits today in nearly a dozen states against demolition 
companies that allegedly failed to take proper precautions while 
working on asbestosridden buildings 
civil lawsuits were filed by the justice department in eight 
cities and additional court papers were expected to be filed later 
in the day naming a total of 34 defendants in connection with 
violations of asbestos removal requirements the epa said 
todays coasttocoast effort to punish violators is a message 
to those who ignore the law said henry habicht epa deputy 
administrator asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans and 
it can be a killer 
habicht said the agency intends to enforce requirements for 
safety measures when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civil 
penalties from companies that do not comply with the safeguards 
fines could range up to 25000 for each violation 
the epa officials declined to name all the defendants until the 
court papers were filed the eight lawsuits filed today involved 
work on school buildings in missouri kansas and washington state as 
well as various buildings from warehouses to restaurants in 
virginia illinois pennsylvania and nevada 
papers also were being prepared for civil action involving work 
on at least 80 school buildings in new york city officials said 
federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestos 
from buildings so that its microscopic fibers are not spread through 
the air violators can be subject to up to 25000 fine per 
violation and face criminal prosecution in some cases 
the inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer 
asbestosis a scarring of the lung and mesothelioma a cancer of 
the chest and abdomen asbestos was used in past years in insulation 
and other building materials 
improper removal practices pose health risks to construction 
workers and people who return to the building or to other nearby 
buildings since asbestos particles often linger in the air for a 
long time epa officials said 
the epa estimates that up to half of all asbestosinvolved 
renovations may be done without the precautions required by the 
federal clean air act 
the epa officials said none of the new actions involves criminal 
charges but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be over 
250000 
agency sources who asked not to be identified by name said 
papers were also to be filed later in the day as a result of 
violations in new york california and florida 
the projects cited include work on at least 80 new york city 
school buildings public schools in woodinville and kent wash a 
high school in kansas city mo a junior high school in holyrood 
kan and colleges in pittsburg kan and berea ohio 
in one case a contractor was being cited for transporting wine 
tanks by helicopter from a winery in san jose calif without 
removing asbestos insulation pads causing asbestos particles to 
scatter over miles of countryside 
other cases involved a nevada casino an apartment building in 
philadelphia a boiler room at the marine corps base at quantico 
va the seattletacoma airport and two seattle restaurants 
the epa crackdown comes only weeks after a harvard university 
study indicated that in many cases the improper removal of asbestos 
from buildings may pose more of a health risk than leaving the 
material in the building 
the study by harvards energy and environmental policy center 
suggested that if precautions are not taken the removal of 
asbestos may actually increase exposure to building occupants as 
well as workers involved in the renovation 
the epa has estimated that more than 730000 commercial buildings 
in the country still contain some asbestos material last year it 
received about 50000 notifications of renovation projects involving 
asbestos and that number is expected to increase by about 30 
percent this year according to agency officials 
by law the epa must be notified when renovation or demolitions 
involve buildings containing asbestos

a late flurry of technically inspired buying 
pushed most grain and soybean futures prices to a higher close 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
most of the action was in the soybean complex following the 
expiration at noon of the contracts for august delivery of soybeans 
soybean meal and soybean oil analysts said 
some traders sold the august contracts and bought those for 
september october or november delivery the result was a sharp drop 
in the august price and strong rallies in most of the laterdelivery 
contracts 
reports of badly needed rain in critical cropgrowing areas had 
sparked selling of soybean and corn futures at the opening of the 
session but those markets closed with substantial gains 
buying of soybean futures accelerated when the november 
contracts price surpassed the monday sessions high of 592 a 
bushel 
august soybeans went off the board at 606 a bushel 22 cents 
lower than mondays settlement prices 
wheat settled cent lower to cent higher with september at 
390 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with september

nbc said tuesday that starting labor day weekend 
it will try to sell its new fall primetime lineup at sears roebuck 
and co through an ambitious publicity campaign also geared toward 
boosting sales at the nations no 1 retailer 
the monthlong joint program which was first disclosed last 
spring is seen by industry experts as an important step by the 
television networks in halting the erosion of audiences to cable 
independent tv outlets and video tapes 
cbs and k mart corp announced a similar arrangement in may 
the networks provide air time for the retailers and their 
products in exchange for help in publicizing tv programs to a wide 
range of retail customers both the nbc and cbs promotions include 
contests 
network executives hope the promotions will encourage people to 
tune in to the shows at least once and possibly become regular 
viewers 
it really uses the strength of both john miller senior vice 
president for nbc entertainment said of the networkretail tiein 
what were trying to do is make people aware of the new shows and 
interested in the new shows 
this gives us broadbased reach which is very important 
nbc cbs and abc the three major networks claimed only 67 
percent of the audience in prime time during the 198889 tv season 
down from 70 percent in the 198788 season and 92 percent a decade 
ago 
nbcs americas brightest stars nbc sears and you 
promotion which begins sept 3 and will continue for the next four 
weeks attempts to entice viewers and advertisers to five new tv 
series through a combination of games store displays 
advertisements and direct mail 
in the past the networks touted their new shows mainly by 
running promotional spots on their own network or placing ads in 
newspaper tv listings last year nbc ventured into other marketing 
techniques by including its fall schedule on some cereal boxes 
nbc says it will begin traditional promos on wednesday and take 
those a step further by running prommercials on closedcircuit 
sets at sears 850 retail stores next month 
chicagobased sears will also insert an eightpage brochure about 
nbcs shows in its catalog and in bills to its 20 million 
chargecard customers 
sears said it hopes to increase sales and store traffic now at 
around 22 million people daily as a result of the contest and 
joint publicity effort 
included in the promotion is a weekly sweepstakes beginning sept 
3 that offers winners among other things a small part on one of 
the new primetime nbc series baywatch hardball mancuso 
fbi sister kate and nutt house 
contestants must answer questions about nbc programs in a 
questionnaire that will appear in sears advertising supplements 
those playing the cbs game will have to watch specific shows to 
see if they have won while those participating in nbcs contest 
will be able to find the answers in the advertising supplement 
itself 
continental airlines a subsidiary of houstonbased texas air 
corp will also provide roundtrip tickets to hollywood calif to 
the nbc grand prize winners in addition to 300 pairs of tickets to 
other sweepstakes winners an inflight video will outline the fall 
schedules of nbc and the airline 
general motors corps buick division will provide two dozen 1990 
reattas for the contest 
both continental and buick will get mentioned in the nbc ads

stock prices were mixed today after dropping in 
mondays session by the biggest amount in nearly two months 
wall street appeared to be following the bond market where 
interestrate worries sent the treasurys benchmark 30year bond 
down 2332 point or more than 7 per 1000 in face value 
weighing on the bond market was a commerce department on durable 
goods orders that was interpreted by bond investors as an indication 
of healthy economic growth strong growth is often accompanied by 
inflation which hurts bond prices 
although durable orders fell a seasonally adjusted 19 percent in 
july they were up a revised 14 percent in june in addition the 
widely watched category of nondefense capital goods was up 5 
percent in july after a 51 percent rise in june 
a late rally brought the market roughly even after having been

texas billionaire harold simmons through one of 
his holdings has contacted the head of georgia gulf corp 
suggesting a variety of moves that could enhance the value of 
the atlanta companys stock of which simmons owns almost 10 percent 
georgia gulf stock jumped 6 a share following the release of the 
letter tuesday but analysts said the correspondence was vague and 
shed little light on the texans intentions 
the letter dated monday was signed by j landis martin 
president and chief executive officer of houstonbased nl industries 
inc a chemical and oil service company acquired by simmons last 
year it was released in atlanta by georgia gulf 
georgia gulf officials declined to comment on the letter saying 
in a statement it would be given appropriate consideration in due 
course 
simmons owns 23 million shares of georgia gulf a chemical and 
polymer spinoff of atlantabased georgiapacific corp in a filing 
with the securities and exchange commission earlier this month 
simmons said his interest in the company was no longer held solely 
for the purpose of investment 
the sec filing set off speculation that simmons might launch a 
takeover bid and kept georgia gulfs stock price rising two months 
ago the price was 35 a share it closed tuesday at 5875 on the 
new york stock exchange up 725 
we believe that the value of georgia gulfs common shares would 
be enhanced by a transaction in which shareholders receive 55 per 
share in cash said the letter to james r kuse chairman of 
georgia gulf 
such a transaction might take the form of a leveraged 
recapitalization merger or other transaction in our present view 
georgia gulfs foreseeable cash flow could service the amount of 
debt required to fund such a transaction as well as fund needed 
capital expenditures the letter read 
martin said nl industries was ready to participate in such a 
transaction for example by contributing its existing holdings to 
fund a new equity base 
i see it as just another pressure tactic said john garcia 
an analyst with wertheim schroder amp co in new york theres 
nothing concrete in the statement hes not saying hes going to buy 
the company 
because no offer has been made garcia said georgia gulf doesnt 
have to respond a possible move however might be for georgia gulf 
to establish an employee stock ownership plan to fend off a hostile 
takeover attempt he said 
analysts previously have said a takeover is unlikely without the 
consent of georgia gulf management because the companys managers 
own 25 million shares and the company has little debt 
simmons has built a fortune estimated at more than 16 billion 
by buying and selling major corporations his holding company 
dallasbased valhi inc had 1988 sales of 225 billion he got nl 
industries in a 1 billion deal his largest last year 
georgia gulf created in 1985 by georgiapacific had 1988 sales 
of 106 billion

sugar futures prices rose sharply tuesday amid rumors that india 
had made a longexpected purchase of refined white sugar on the 
world market to partly offset its projected shortfall of nearly 1 
million metric tons 
on other markets grain and soybean futures finished mostly 
higher while livestock oil and preciousmetal futures were mixed 
sugar futures settled 42 cent to 60 cent higher on new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in 
october at 1395 cents a pound 
world sugar stocks are so low due to several years of poor 
sugarcane crops and steadily rising consumption that any hint of 
new purchases by largescale consumers like india china or the 
soviet union tends to throw the market into a bullish frenzy 
there was no confirmation of tuesdays rumor which began on the 
united terminal sugar market in london 
analysts said indian buying had been expected for months indias 
government recently approved emergency funds to buy refined white 
sugar known as whites in the trade to offset an expected 
shortfall of nearly 1 million metric tons 
theyre talking 200000 to 300000 tons said analyst kim 
badenhop of merrill lynch capital markets inc they may just take 
that tonnage in one clip and the whites situation is so tight that 
its really going to have an impact on prices 
but another analyst harry schwartz of cargill investor services 
inc in new york said the india rumor had surfaced only to justify 
heavy computerbased buying by commodity funds 
he conceded that supply and demand factors pointed to higher 
prices but contended that tuesdays buying was triggered by the 
markets failure on monday to significantly extend the sharp losses 
registered friday 
when the market lacked this followthrough it found itself in 
an oversold condition and buystops today propelled the advance 
schwartz said 
a late flurry of technicallyinspired buying pushed most grain 
and soybean futures higher on the chicago board of trade 
most of the action was in the soybean complex following the 
expiration at noon of the contracts for august delivery of soybeans 
soybean meal and soybean oil analysts said 
august soybeans went off the board at 606 a bushel 22 cents 
lower than mondays settlement prices 
wheat settled cent lower to cent higher with september at 
390 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september 
at 238 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 2 cents higher with 
september at 141 a bushel soybeans excluding august were 6 
cents lower to 9 cents higher with september at 603 a bushel 
most cattle futures prices rose on the chicago mercantile 
exchange in line with higher spotmarket prices for fed cattle hog 
futures were mixed while porkbelly futures advanced on expectations 
of stronger demand for bacon 
live cattle settled unchanged to 35 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 7410 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 02 cent lower to 15 cent higher with august at 8420 
cents a pound live hogs were 05 cent lower to 25 cent higher with 
october at 4065 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 02 cent to 
108 cents higher with august at 2682 cents a pound 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures settled unchanged to 12 
cents higher in lackluster trading on the new york mercantile 
exchange where the september contract expired at 1908 a barrel 
and the october contract climbed 5 cents to 1869 heating oil 
settled 03 cent to 13 cent lower with september at 5179 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 46 cent to 76 cent higher with 
september at 5358 cents a gallon 
gold finished unchanged to 50 cents lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with august at 36790 a troy ounce silver was 03 cent to 
08 cent lower with september at 5235 a troy ounce

uneventful trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil closed flat at 1908 a barrel unchanged 
from monday despite the final day of trading on the contract 
contracts for delivery later in the year posted slight gains 
among refined products traded on the exchange unleaded gasoline 
for september delivery rose 076 cent to 5358 cents a gallon other 
contracts had smaller advances 
domestic heating oil for september slipped 010 cent to 5179 
cents a gallon and later contract months also declined 
traders said that except for two brief buying spurts one early 
and another shortly before the closing bell activity was slow with 
products leading the way 
crude for september delivery dipped to 1888 during the session 
but strong selling in the gasoline market helped recover some of the 
losses 
strength in gasoline helped hold up crude said jack unger 
energy broker with merrill lynch energy futures 
analysts said anticipation of a drop in us gasoline stocks 
helped boost prices the american petroleum institute releases 
weekly inventory statistics on crude and refined products after the 
close of trading on tuesday 
traders expect a rise in heating oil stocks and only minimal 
changes in crude supplies unger said

mazda motor corp on tuesday introduced 
three new 1990model cars two of them subcompacts and unveiled an 
advertising campaign aimed at making the japanese automakers name 
more recognizable to us buyers 
the new models include the 929 s which basically is the same as 
mazdas flagship 929 sedan but with a 190 horsepower engine 
compared with the 158 horsepower engine in the standard 929 
the more powerful engine will add 1500 to the 929 base price of 
23300 the 929s base price for 1989 is 20900 
mazda also introduced two new subcompacts a restyled 323 
hatchback and the 323 protege sedan mazda will keep the 323 
designation in front of the protege for a year then drop it the 323 
hatchbacks base price is 6599 the same as in 1989 and the 
proteges is 9339 
in other product news mazda said it was offering a 
fourwheeldrive version of its mpv minivan and would begin building 
1990 models of its 626 sedan at its plant in flat rock south of 
detroit mazda also makes its mx6 coupe and the ford probe at the 
plant 
by the time 626 production at flat rock reaches full production 
of 54000 cars a year that plant will produce most of the 80000 or 
so 626 cars it expects to sell in the united states next year 
that gives the company more room in its import quota for the 
miata twoseat convertible sports car which has met with heavy 
demand the company plans to import 40000 of the cars a year 
although it doesnt plan to boost availability in the united states 
mazda began a new series of brandidentification advertisements 
earlier this month and will show off its 1990 cars and trucks in 
another series of ads beginning in september said george mccabe 
deputy general manager and group vice president for sales of mazdas 
us marketing arm 
compared with honda and toyota mazda consistently trails in 
the areas of brand image and brand familiarity mccabe said our 
image is generally positive yet it is not nearly as well defined as 
hondas or toyotas 
he said the campaign would focus on a new theme involving the 
japanese concept of kansei engineering or incorporating a 
drivers five senses into design and engineering of a car 
the companys new advertising slogan will be it just feels 
right 
separately a mazda executive said the company is exploring 
development of a second dealer network to market luxury cars as 
honda motor co has done with acura 
this fall toyota motor corp will deliver lexus cars to a second 
dealer network and nissan motor corp plans the same with its 
infiniti line 
yoshinori taura president of mazda motor of america said his 
company is studying what honda toyota and nissan are doing but a 
target date hasnt been set for deciding whether mazda would develop 
another dealer channel for luxury cars

the american stock exchange said tuesday it had 
asked a federal appeals court to delay an order that would halt 
trading in a new type of security that is based on the value of 
broad stock market indexes 
amex spokesman robert shabazian said the exchange made the 
request partly to give investors who have bought these securities 
known as stock baskets more time to liquidate them for cash 
a ruling friday by the 7th circuit court of appeals in chicago 
threw into question the legitimacy of stock baskets which have been 
traded on the amex philadelphia stock exchange and chicago board 
options exchange for three months 
agreeing with a complaint brought by the chicago futures 
industry the court ruled that the securities resemble futures 
contracts not stocks as such they should be regulated by the 
commodity futures trading commission and not the securities and 
exchange commission which originally sanctioned them 
the american and philadelphia exchanges denounced the courts 
decision saying it reflected a jurisdictional dispute between two 
federal regulatory agencies and inevitably would harm small 
investors for whom the baskets were designed 
baskets are priced to reflect changes in indexes such as the 
standard amp poors 500stock index and the dow jones average of 30 
industrials investors receive quarterly cash payments equal to a 
proportionate share of any regular cash dividend declared on the 
stocks in the index 
the appeals court gave holders of stock baskets until sept 8 to 
liquidate their positions 
but the amex in its request for a delay of that deadline said 
late september was a more logical deadline time because it would 
permit holders to receive a regularly scheduled dividend payment 
sept 15 and give the amex time to complete the settlement process 
shabazian said it was too early to say whether the amex would 
join the philadelphia exchange in appealing the federal court ruling 
he said 229000 baskets were traded tuesday on the amex compared 
with 817000 friday and it didnt appear that investors were 
rushing to dump them

anchor glass container corp said tuesday its 
board of directors has recommended that shareholders reject a 280 
million buyout offer from vitro sa of monterey mexico 
the recommendation came after the board rejected a 20ashare 
takeover bid from the mexican manufacturer saying it wasnt in the 
best interest of the shareholders 
anchor the nations no 2 glass maker after corning glass works 
said the boards decision was based in part on an opinion from its 
financial advisor morgan stanley amp co inc which called the vitro 
offer financially inadequate 
vitro said it had offered a good price 
we believe that the price we are offering shareholders is full 
and fair the company said in a statement market analysts have 
uniformly concluded that the 20 price is not only fair but 
generous 
the mexican company said anchors stock was trading at a price 
below 10 a share the week before its offer was made 
in a related development goldman sachs amp co a new york 
investment banking company has bought 97 percent of anchor stock 
raising speculation of a possible bidding war for the glass company 
according to a report filed monday with the securities and 
exchange commission goldman sachs paid 266 million or 1970 a 
share for anchor common stock from aug 9 through aug 14 the 
report said the purchase which started the day vitro announced its 
offer was for investment purposes only 
but goldman sachs said it will continually evaluate anchor and 
reserves the right to change its plans 
i think theyve left the door more open than a typical passive 
investor would said greg corso an attorney for the secs 
tenderoffers office in washington 
anchor said its board also has instructed management to work with 
the companys legal and financial advisors to explore and 
investigate a variety of alternative courses of action intended to 
maximize stockholder values 
vitro which holds 103 percent of anchors stock had called 
anchor a struggling company that could not control its future and 
claimed that anchors plants needed upgrading 
the mexican company which intended to merge anchor and latchford 
glass co of huntington park calif had already chosen latchford 
president clifford l jones to head the merged operations 
vitro said tuesday that it saw no sign that anchors management 
can reverse the deteriorating situation 
anchors board claims to be exploring alternatives including 
the payment of a special dividend vitro said but anchor has 
previously stated that it cannot pay any dividends because of 
covenants in its debt agreements 
anchor said the board has unanimously adopted a shareholder 
rights plan which it said was similar to defensive plans adopted by 
many other publicly traded companies 
the plan provides for preferred stockpurchase rights which will 
be distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share 
of common stock held as of the close of business on sept 1 1989 
in a letter to anchor shareholders vincent j naimoli chairman 
president and chief executive officer said the plan is intended to 
protect the interests of shareholders in light of the vitro offer 
it is not intended to prevent an acquisition of the company 
pursuant to an offer for all outstanding common stock on terms that 
are in the best interests of all stockholders and it will not be 
used for that purpose naimoli added 
vitro said it may reconsider its proposal 
giving this deteriorating financial condition and the anchor 
boards apparent intent to try to block our offer vitro 
reserves its right to reevaluate its offer if it is delayed in 
consummating the transaction the company said in a statement

the nations oldest operating distillery has 
filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law apparently 
stalling an attempt by a bank seeking to recover 6000 barrels of 
whiskey it owns 
michters distillerys filing under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy act on friday came just days before before the company

chapter 11 frees a company from creditors lawsuits until it can 
develop a plan to put its finances in order

bank had loaned veru 48 million

aquarii holding co of delaware and a subsidiary but retained 
ownership of the 585000 gallons of rye corn bourbon and sourmash

the company banned the bank from the distillery after a 
disagreement over insurance under a court order in june the bank 
was allowed to sample the whiskey which remains stored at the 
distillery

dispute about that but what were going to do at this point were

week 
michters officials declined to comment

losses by the nations savings institutions 
rose to 37 billion in the apriljune quarter the worst in a year 
regulators said tuesday they warned that the red ink wont end soon 
despite enactment of a multibilliondollar industry bailout 
the second quarter loss was up from 35 billion in the first 
three months of 1989 and was the worst since the record 41 billion 
in the same period of last year the office of thrift supervision 
said 
for the first half of the year losses were mounting at a rate 
that could make 1989 the worst year for the savings industry since 
the depression topping 1988s record of 134 billion 
the law signed aug 9 by president bush is intended to end the 
hemorrhaging by shutting down failed thrifts or selling them to new 
owners eventually the legislation which will pump 50 billion 
into sampls over the next 26 months should put the industry on an 
even keel but not right away warned james r barth chief 
economist of the thrift office 
you should not expect losses to instantly go away because of 
the signing barth said adding i would not be totally 
suprised to see no improvement in the industrys earnings in the 
quarter ending sept 30 
as in the past losses were concentrated in texas but for the 
first time california and arizona rivaled the oilproducing states 
in southwest which have been plagued for several years by bank and 
sampl failures 
texas losses totaled 13 billion a little more than a third of 
the 35 billion in red ink recorded in the state during the same 
period a year ago 
california thrifts lost 950 million the secondworst total in 
the nation a sharp turnaround from profits of 1267 million a year 
ago they were followed by arizona sampls which lost 515 million a 
marked deterioration from the 58 million loss a year ago 
barth said thrifts nationwide suffered from rising interest rates 
during the second quarter but the california loss was heavily 
influenced by two large institutions which were taken over by 
regulators and forced to recognize losses from sour loans 
lincoln savings and loan association in los angeles posted a 788 
million loss while gibraltar savings of beverly hills lost 332 
million he said 
arizona meanwhile is suffering from a severe real estate 
downturn 
other measures of the industrys health declined as well the 
number of insolvent sampls rose from 394 at the end of the first 
quarter to 401 at the end of june only 68 percent of the nations 
2934 thrifts earned a profit down from 73 percent in the first 
quarter profitable thrifts earned 12 billion which was more than 
swamped by 49 billion in losses at the other institutions 
the industrys capital the cushion between losses and 
government deposit insurance funds slipped from 289 percent of 
loans and other assets to 259 percent 
barth said the industrys loss rate should improve as the 
government closes institutions or finds new owners and the embedded 
losses are transferred to the governments books 
at a separate briefing for reporters officials of the resolution 
trust corp the new agency created to dispose of failed sampls said 
they have already injected 921 million into 11 badly insolvent sampls 
in an effort to cut interest rates paid on deposits and reduce 
losses 
the agency expects to inject an additional 14 billion to 15 
billion by the end of next month which it estimates will trim the 
industrys losses by 500 million a year 
it is a way to instantly cut down the 20 million a day that is 
being lost said l william seidman chairman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp which is staffing the new agency the 
reason institutions are losing money is they are paying more for 
their money than they are receiving thats bad business 
barth said it is clear from sampls balance sheet that the industry 
will undergo a massive restructuring under the legislation passed 
earlier this month 
a key requirement of the law is that thrifts raise more capital 
excluding the 293 most deeply insolvent sampls only half of the 
remaining institutions representing 85 percent of the industrys 
assets meet capital requirements going into effect by the end of 
this year he said 
he said those institutions will either have to shrink their 
operations or find new investors to inject 30 billion in fresh 
capital 
also one in four institutions cant meet the new requirement 
that they maintain 70 percent of their assets in housingrelated 
loans the old standard was 60 percent 
thrifts are already moving to meet one requirement of the law a 
prohibition on junk bond ownership taking effect in five years sampls 
owned 126 billion in junk bonds at the end of june down from 
144 billion three months earlier

an ice cream maker famous for its campaigns 
to save the rain forests and promote peace has targeted another 
issue the use of hormones to increase milk production in cows 
ben and jerrys homemade inc of waterbury says it will use 6 
million of its ice cream pints to lobby against bovine growth 
hormone the pints will be labeled with a message to stop bgh 
save family farms 
news of the campaign prompted officials from monsanto co a lead 
developer of the hormone to fly to vermont on tuesday to meet with 
company officials 
if the intent of the program is to try to stop the product i 
think its unfair its unfortunate its misinformed and 
discouraging montsanto spokesman lawrence oneill said in a 
telephone interview from the companys headquarters in st louis 
oneill also suggested that ben amp jerrys not turn its back on a 
technology that could potentially help vermont dairy farmers 
bovine growth hormone which is expected to win federal approval 
next year is a genetically engineered copy of a naturally occurring 
protein when injected in cows it can increase milk output by up to 
15 percent 
monsanto one of four companies developing the hormone argues 
that bgh is a management tool that can help dairy farmers produce 
more milk with the same number of cows 
but many farmers as well as some industry leaders and 
economists fear that greater milk production will decrease milk 
prices paid to farmers and force smaller producers out of business 
we feel it presents a clear threat to the dairy industry as we 
know it here in vermont and to smallscale familybased dairy 
farming around the country said ben amp jerrys spokesman alan 
parker 
ben amp jerrys is one of the nations leading producers of 
superpremium ice cream and consequently a major purchaser of milk 
and cream 
the 6 million pints have been labeled with the antibgh message 
as well as a telephone number 1802bghfarm parker said callers 
will hear a recorded message from company founders ben cohen and 
jerry greenfield opposing the hormone technology 
we dont think the big companies that are hoping for big 
profits by selling bgh are taking into account the human and social 
costs of putting more and more small farms out of business the 
recording will say when it begins this fall 
cohen and greenfield also will ask for callers names and 
addresses so that they can send materials about the hormone 
parker said the pints will be distributed in more than 35 states 
in september and october 
to help save rain forests ben amp jerrys is donating 40 percent 
of the profit from its rainforest crunch bars to rain forestbased 
organizations to protect these areas 
last year ben amp jerrys launched a campaign to promote peace by 
donating 1 percent of the profits from sales of its peace pops to a 
lobbying effort to have 1 percent of the us military budget spent 
on peace promotion

in two hearings tuesday a stern delaware 
supreme court told lawyers and speculators in the highstakes 
corporate takeover business that the justices will not tolerate 
violations of their orders or courtroom rules 
saying that sneaking a portable telephone into the courtroom was 
reprehensible the justices found new york lawyer and 
arbitrageur alexander m metviner in contempt of court and fined him 
1000

portable telephone in the courtroom during the shamrock holdings 
inc battle for polaroid corp 
in a hearing immediately following the court dismissed contempt 
proceedings against barbara robbins a partner with the new 
yorkbased law firm of wachtell lipton rosen amp katz the court 
said it was convinced she mistakenly released confidential documents 
to the new york times concerning the paramount communications inc 
bid for time inc

top corporate lawyers and robbins attorney for not apologizing to 
the court for the discomfort the mistake caused the court 
the newspaper reported the documents had been released by the 
delaware supreme court 
metviner who works for oppenheimer amp co in new york ran afoul

rules 
twenty days later however he admitted he had the phone with him 
in the courtroom during the entire proceeding 
chief justice andrew d christie told metviner the dignity of the 
court was at stake and violations need to be taken seriously 
we need to send a message to those who act in a very unseemly 
way in the courtroom we need to send a message this will not be 
tolerated a very strong message christie said 
in the robbins case the court said it felt a responsibility to 
prevent any future mistakes the justices suggested new york lawyers 
consult with delaware attorneys before releasing documents or that 
they contact lawyers who request confidentiality on behalf of their 
clients
