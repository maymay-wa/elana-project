for her children 
she knows that no matter what happens next in the confrontation 
with iraq they are going to suffer the economic consequences of 
the crisis 
jordan its economy already in perilous shape and now burdened 
with hundreds of thousands of refugees is staring disaster in the 
face 
rebecca salti utahborn director of save the children in 
jordan said that even if the crisis does not flare into war 
jordanian children will be going hungry within a matter of months 
were just trying to figure out how to get through the 
winter she said its going to be tough there will be food 
shortages or the inability to buy food by late winter or early 
spring 
the crisis has devastated aisha halifas family in beni hamide 
25 miles southwest of amman she and about 600 other women in a 
cluster of bedouin villages in the mountains weave rugs for sale to 
tourists but the visitors arent coming any more because of the 
fear of war 
her family raises goats and has a few olive trees but it was 
the income from her weaving that paid for secondhand clothes 
school supplies and medical care for her children 
until early august she received some money from her 23yearold 
son working in kuwait but he fled the iraqi invasion and came 
home along with 120000 of his countrymen suddenly poor and 
unemployed 
before the crisis unemployment in jordan was at 15 percent 
now theres almost no chance that aishas son or husband will find 
work 
families wont have money to take their children to the 
doctor everything will go into food they wont be able to buy 
shoes erasers or notebooks to keep the kids in school ms salti 
said 
already ms halifa cant afford a visit to the clinic for her 
son who has a scalp disease within weeks there wont be enough 
money for school supplies the girls will be forced to drop out so 
their brothers can go on a little while longer by spring there 
might not even be food

falling from under her brown headscarf if they cant make it 
how can we i dont know what were going to do im frightened for

ones most overlooked by the international community said nigel 
fischer unicefs deputy regional director in amman 
the impact will extend far beyond jordan leila bisharat 
unicefs chief of programs for the middle east says similar 
hardships will confront children in impoverished nations whose 
fathers once sent paychecks home from kuwait 
every one of the wage earners whove fled once sent money home 
to support an extended family kuwait was their one lifeline and 
now thats gone she said 
bangladesh sri lanka india and the philippines are 
illprepared to absorb the hundreds of thousands of returning 
refugees or help their families 
for these countries the months ahead appear bleak the persian 
gulf standoff is pushing their already fragile economies closer to 
disaster 
we have all over the world four to six million children wholl 
now have no source of income mrs bisharat said were all 
holding our breath for what could be a catastrophe 
jordan alone will lose 400 million in workers pay this year 
the finance ministry says the number of people living below the 
world bankdefined poverty line of 1600 a year could jump from 25 
percent to 40 percent by spring experts say 
half of jordans 31 million people are under 15 years old milk 
is already being rationed and unicef says it has already seen a 
slight increase in malnutrition in the poorest of ammans 
neighborhoods packed with palestinian refugees 
these families were managing to feed their kids well the kids 
were looking healthy all across jordan we had just sort of made

the children were immunized they were in school the girls 
were being educated and they were just beginning to bloom in every 
way jordan was coming into its own

the government has decided to postpone 
elections in the state of punjab where sikh militants are waging a 
separatist war officials said saturday 
the decision adopted at a latenight cabinet meeting friday 
requires a constitutional amendment to extend the federal rule 
which has been in effect since may 1987 
prime minister vp singh who favored an election to reinstate 
a local government failed to reach a consensus among the parties 
allied to his national front government 
press trust of india said the government will convene a special 
session of parliament oct 1 to amend the constitution to sanction 
a further sixmonth extension of federal rule formally known as 
presidents rule the current term expires nov 10 
under indian law the federal government may proclaim a state of 
emergency and take over a states administration for up to three 
years by seeking the approval of parliament every six months 
each extension beyond three years requires a constitutional 
amendment passed by a twothirds majority the first such amendment 
was passed last may 
fridays decision was taken after prolonged consultations 
between singhs minority national front government its leftist and 
rightist allies and the argest opposition group the congress 
party 
the fronts allies said the situation in punjab was not 
conducive for the polls former prime minister rajiv gandhis 
congress party left its position unclear 
congress support is necessary to push through the amendment if 
the proposed legislation fails the government will have to 
announce a polling date before oct 6 
the local parties in punjab oppose federal rule but some 
factions have indicated they would boycott any election unless the 
federal government grants more autonomy to the sikh territory 
underground sikh militants who have been fighting since 1982 for a 
separate sikh state have stayed aloof of the issue 
the militants demand for independence grows out of their 
complaint that the sikhs are culturally and politically 
discriminated by the hindudominated government 
sikhs make up less that 2 percent of indias 880 million people 
but form about 55 percent of punjab population nationwide hindus 
comprise more than 80 percent of the population 
sikh militants have been blamed for killing more than 2000 
people this year in punjab and neighboring states

boris yeltsin president of the russian republic 
was back on a collision course with mikhail s gorbachev saturday 
as he challenged the soviet leaders request for new emergency 
powers to rescue the economy 
yeltsin and gorbachev have waged a threeyear political feud 
that has complicated gorbachevs efforts to implement urgent 
economic reform 
in a statement read on the nightly television news program 
vremya the countrys most widely watched program yeltsin and 
other leaders of russias legislature called gorbachevs request 
for expanded powers unacceptable 
the leaders vowed to take all necessary measures to defend the 
sovereignty and constitutional order of russia 
gorbachev asked the national legislature friday to expand his 
powers in order to begin an economic rescue plan without having to 
go through the tedious process of seeking lawmakers approval at 
each step 
gorbachev seeks the authority to issue decrees on property 
management of the economy prices and law enforcement 
the national supreme soviet would have the power to recommend 
gorbachev revoke or modify the decrees the supreme soviet is 
scheduled to vote on the rquest monday the same day it is to 
choose from among three economic plans 
yeltsin fears gorbachev seeks the power to introduce 
presidential rule in sovereign republics and disband their 
governments that request is not contained in gorbachevs 
resolution but apparently was inferred from his comments to the 
supreme soviet 
gorbachev said he needed the extra authority because the dire 
state of the economy requires extreme action the powers would be 
used to implement one of the three plans to switch the soviet union 
to a market economy 
yeltsins celebrated clashes with gorbachev date back to 
criticism of reforms at a communist party meeting in 1987 the 
attacks have escalated since yeltsin was elected president of 
russia in may 
the two politicians the most prominent in the country have 
most recently battled over the rights of republics the russian 
parliament has declared that its laws take priority over those 
passed by the soviet parliament

japans justice minister compared prostitutes in 
japan to black americans who move into white neighborhoods and 
ruin the atmosphere but later said he regretted the remark 
the comment was the latest in a series of remarks by japanese 
government officials that have offended american minority groups a 
washingtonbased civil rights group called the comment by justice 
minister seiroku kaqjiyama racist 
its a reprehensible and racist statement said ralph neas 
executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
kajiyama made the commen at a news conference friday after 
observing a nighttime raid on the shinjuku district of tokyo a 
notorious redlight district 
its like in america when neighborhoods become mixed because 
blacks move in and whites are forced out kajiyama said after 
watching police and immigration authorities arrest foreign women 
for alleged prostitution 
prostitutes ruin the atmosphere of neighborhoods in the same 
way the 64yearold minister said a justice ministry spokesman 
confirmed the comments saturday after they appeared in japanese 
news reports 
shortly after the news conference the ministry issued a 
statement quoting kajiyama as saying he meant to convey that people 
living in the shinjuku area feel insecure and have been 
complaining 
i intended to say that we must take measures to solve this 
problem i did not mean to talk about racial issues kajiyama 
said in the statement 
it said the ministers comments contained expressions that may 
cause misunderstanding but the statement did not contain an 
explicit apology 
in observing the police raid kajiyama was carrying out one of 
his first official duties as justice minister he was appointed 
last week to replace shin hasegawa who resigned because of 
illness 
minority groups in the united states have criticized japan in 
recent years for similar statements made by japanese politicians 
as well as advertising images and allegedly discriminatory hiring 
practices by usbased japanese companies 
sensitivity to racial issues is a new ballgame for old 
japanese politicians and they still dont know how to play it 
said patricia steinhoff a university of hawaii sociologist doing 
research in japan 
there is a very high acceptance of discrimination in japan 
she said they dont realize this is out of bounds elsewhere 
the discriminatory comments have sometimes arisen when 
politicians and other japanese praised the homogeneity of 
japans population 
american minority groups protested vigorously in 1986 when 
thenprime minister yasuhiro nakasone said on the average the 
united states is lower because of a considerable number of blacks 
puerto ricans and mexicans 
nakasone said he was referring to literacy rate he later 
apologized and said he realized his comment had offended many 
americans but he did not retract his remarks 
in 1988 michio watanabe policy chief for the governing liberal 
democratic party said american blacks have few qualms about going 
bankrupt and implied they walk away from their debts 
prime minister noboru takeshita and watanabe later apologized 
for his remark 
but the furor ignited a debate in the us congress the 
congressional black caucus accused three japanese companies of 
producing products and mannequins which allegedly show blacks in a 
stereotypical and degrading light the products included wideeyed 
black dolls with redlipped grins 
the latest controversy comes at a time when american attitudes 
toward japan have soured because of trade tensions and the belief 
that japan has been slow in providing support in the persian gulf 
crisis according to recent polls 
despite a law outlawing prostitution in japan it is a 
flourishing underground industry 
the numbers of foreign prostitutes have increased along with a 
flood of workers entering or staying in japan illegally to earn 
highly valued yen mobsters are known to recruit foreign 
prostitutes and operate bars and brothels where they work

president hafez assad of syria met 
saturday with his iranian counterpart hashemi rafsanjani and 
reportedly tried to persuade him not to send food and medicine to 
iraq in violation of the un embargo 
the talks in tehran also were believed to have focused on the 
fate of 13 western hostages in lebanon according to news reports 
and diplomats 
rafsanjani voiced concern about the presence of us and other 
western military forces in the region the official islamic 
republic news agency reported 
we should not allow foreign forces and those hegemonist powers 
who are all geared up to tighten their grip on vital oil resources 
the persian gulf the red sea and other sensitive points of the 
world to remain in the region rafsanjani said 
assad agreed that security would best be provided by countries 
of the region the news agency reported 
irans official tehran radio did not say how long the two 
presidents talked in private it said they later opened their 
discussions to their vice presidents and foreign ministers 
the broadcast said assad who was on his first visit to iran 
earlier visited the tomb of revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini on the outskirts of the iranian capital 
assad an archrival of iraqi president saddam hussein has 
allied himself with the americans and others against saddam 
following the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
us officials hope assads leverage in tehran stemming from 
his support of iran during the 198088 war with iraq will 
persuade rafsanjani not to help saddam circumvent the trade 
embargo 
diplomatic reports have suggested iran may allow food and 
medicine into iraq which agreed to formally end its war with iran 
last month that freed tens of thousands of troops from iraqs 
eastern border for redeployment in southern iraq and occupied 
kuwait 
assad who met last week with secretary of state james a baker 
iii was believed to be carrying a message for rafsanjani from 
washington asking what it would take for tehran to abide by the 
sanctions 
he was also expected to stress to iran that the us 
intervention in the persian gulf is aimed solely at forcing saddam 
out of kuwait and will not be permanent according to diplomatic 
sources who requested anonymity 
syria stands to gain western aid for its ramshackle economy and 
political support withheld in the past because of alleged links to 
terrorism they said 
arriving at tehrans mehrabad airport for his first visit to 
iran assad said he was happy to be among his dear brethren 
tehran radio reported 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus quoted assad as saying he was 
looking forward to meeting irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei 
assad said his talks in tehran will cover bilateral issues the 
gulf crisis and ways of confronting zionism the islamic 
republic news agency reported he made no reference to the western 
hostages held by proiranian militants in lebanon where syria is 
the main power broker 
but the englishlanguage tehran times which reflects government 
thinking said saturday it was coordination between the islamic 
republic and syria as well as the application of their spiritual 
influence which led to the release of some western hostages in 
lebanon 
the statement was an apparent reference to irans role in the 
release last april of american educators robert polhill and frank 
reed 
hours after assads visit was announced tuesday javad mansoori 
irans ambassador in pakistan said that some of the western 
hostages could be released within days 
diplomats in damascus and tehran have said the hostages plight 
will be a main topic in assads meetings with rafsanjani 
most of the hostages six americans four britons two west 
germans and an italian are held by shiite factions linked to the 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god tehrans main ally in 
lebanon 
the hostages include journalist terry anderson 42 the 
longestheld captive anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press was kidnapped on march 16 1985 
assad discussed the hostage issue with baker in damascus last 
week 
setting aside more than a decade of hostility with the united 
states assad has sent about 4000 troops t join the usled 
multinational force in saudi arabia baker won a pledge from assad 
to send another 15000 soliders 
assad will try to gauge the seriousness of iranian suggestions 
it may dispatch food and other essentials to iraq 
some analysts have seen the iranian threats as a ploy to secure 
western aid 
rafsanjani has sought the return of iranian assets frozen by
