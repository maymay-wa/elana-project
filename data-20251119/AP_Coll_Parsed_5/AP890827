egypt and jordan on sunday urged syria to 
cooperate with an arab league committee appointed to mediate an end 
to conflict in lebanon that has left nearly 800 people in less than 
six months 
king hussein of jordan met with egypts president hosni mubarak 
in cairo for three hours of talks on regional issues principally 
the escalating violence in lebanon between christian troops and 
syrianbacked moslems 
the latest round in the conflict broke out in march when 
christian army commander gen michel aoun blockaded illegal 
moslemrun ports the syrians responded by blockading the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
mubarak said he hoped syria would cooperate with a 
threemember arab league committee of algeria morocco and saudi 
arabia appointed in a may arab summit in casablanca morocco to 
mediate peace in lebanon 
must not leave the solution for what is happening in lebanon to 
nonarab countries because that would make us appear weak 
mubarak told reporters after the meeting we as arabs are 
responsible for what happens in lebanon 
mubarak apparently referred to french and soviet negotiations 
last week with christian and moslem leaders in lebanon and syria 
the soviet union is syrias principal weapons supplier 
hussein said however it was uncertain whether the arab league 
committee will be able to carry out its mandate to end to the war 
the committee said this month that its efforts had failed and blamed 
syria for refusing to schedule withdrawal of its estaimted 40000 
troops from lebanon 
we must wait and see whether the committee will continue its 
work or not hussein said 
syria entered lebanon with a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate but became involved on the moslem side of that countrys 
civil war 
a jordanian official said in amman on condition of anonymity 
that jordan egypt and other arab countries were mediating with the 
syrians to end lebanons violence 
on saturday hussein met with syrias foreign minister farouk 
elsharaa in amman 
egypt and syria have no diplomatic ties but relations have 
improved recently after 10 years of bitterness that followed cairos 
peace treaty with israel

hilary antonia foretich turned 7 last week in 
hiding with her father marking the birthday at a subdued capitol 
hill ceremony and her mother nearing two years in jail for refusing 
to disclose the little girls whereabouts 
hilary has been missing for two years on monday since a 
washington judge ordered her mother dr elizabeth morgan to 
surrender the youngster for unsupervised visits with her father 
morgan refused to comply and remains in jail on contempt of court 
charges 
morgan claims that hilarys father dr eric foretich sexually 
abused the girl foretich vehemently denies the allegation and 
contends that his former wife is suffering from delusions 
while the parents struggle continues mental health 
professionals are questioning whether hilary can survive the ordeal 
without emotional scars 
for any child a separation from both parents on an abrupt and 
sudden basis is very harmful and could cause serious longterm 
consequences said dr jerry wiener president of the american 
academy of child and adolescent psychiatry theres no way that 
she could not be significantly affected from this experience and i 
would think that any effects could not be undone 
constance ahrons a noted california psychologist in the field of 
child custody cases and author of the book divorced families 
said hilarys separation from her parents could leave the child 
feeling isolated even under protective custody 
this is bound to have a profound effect on her ahrons said 
if she was close to her parents she may feel abandoned in a case 
like this the child is the most vulnerable because of her age and 
because she has no control in what happens to her 
linda holman hilarys courtappointed attorney declined to be 
interviewed and said she refuses all media requests for interviews 
concerning this case she said such interviews contribute to the 
longterm negative impact on hilary 
district of columbia superior court judge herbert dixon has said 
morgan will remain in jail for contempt of court until she 
surrenders hilary 
a threejudge panel of the district of columbia court of appeals 
the citys highest local court ordered that morgan be released 
however the entire court overturned that decision on aug 21 
hilarys seventh birthday and ordered a new hearing on the case 
before the full court next month 
that same day foretich and about a dozen family members and 
friends marked his daughters birthday with a small ceremony on the 
steps of the capitol legislation passed by the house and awaiting a 
vote by the full senate would limit the length of contempt jailings 
in the nations capital and in effect free morgan 
later that same day foretich told the associated press he thinks 
hilary is suffering through an experience that could ultimately lead 
to an early death 
if my daughter is not brought back within the near future it 
will be too late she will lose her ability to ever recover from 
this he said i knew her to be a resilient child but at some 
point that resilience is going to fade i dont want my daughter to 
be an example another statistic of a teenage suicide because she 
feels abandoned by both parents and has been led to believe that her 
father is a pervert and her mother is a crazy woman 
morgan did not respond to a written request for an interview 
relayed through jail officials 
however mary froning a child psychologist who treated hilary 
for two years at her mothers request said the only hardship that 
the young girl has undergone is being apart from her mother for so 
long 
her ordeal is being separated from her mother the only person 
in the world she trusts froning said she is with the people 
she chose to be with so i have every reason to believe she is 
safe 
wiener however wondered whether the oneway communication that 
he presumes hilary receives isnt hurting the girl 
one presumes she is told positive things about her mother and 
negative things about her father weiner said that is not 
constructive not at all 
ahrons said she also was concerned that some problems could 
result from the girl acting as a fugitive to disguise her real 
identity 
there are certainly possible problems with issues concerning 
her own identity said ahrons it could have some effect on her 
life a profound effect who knows 
foretich has his own theory at what point will hilary cease to 
even know who she is he asked 
i mean how many times has her name been changed has her hair 
been colored does she even know who she is anymore her selfimage 
will soon be destroyed if it hasnt already happened

a macabre drama unfolded for a small 
fellowship who with horror and fascination watched television film 
clips of the first clear pictures of the wreck of the edmund 
fitzgerald 
oh yes ive watched it i cant not watch it said ruth 
hudson whose only child bruce 22 died aboard the steel freighter 
during a fierce storm nov 10 1975 his body and those of 28 other 
crewmen remain at the bottom of lake superior 
for three days last week explorers using a submersible robot 
penetrated the cold deep water that has cloaked and preserved the 
fitzgerald since its sinking their video images will provide data 
on the wreck as well as the technology to study other underwater 
sites 
for the families of the fitzgerald crew the expedition opened 
wounds 
people say it gets easier naturally its eased some but to 
me it was just yesterday said hudson of north olmstead ohio 
startling footage of the 556footdeep wreck funded by the 
great lakes shipwreck historical society was difficult for hudson 
to watch 
its a hard time for me it brings back all of the panic she 
said but i cant say i dont want them to do it i have a lot of 
friends that are really angry they ask why are they doing that to 
the families but this is history my son would have wanted it 
shown 
she feels good about public fascination with the wreck they 
really havent forgotten she said 
the tragedy became american folklore particularly after canadian 
balladeer gordon lightfoot wrote a hit song in 1976 about the death 
of the boat he called the pride of the american side 
all that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and 
the sons and the daughters he sang 
edmund bacon fitzgerald said by telephone from tennessee last 
week that his father the edmund fitzgerald for whom the the 
freighter was named was haunted by the wreck until his death in 
1986 the father was president of northwestern mutual life insurance 
co which built the ship in 1958 
the edmund fitzgerald left superior wis under threatening 
skies nov 9 on what was to have been its last trip down the great 
lakes before docking for the winter 
by the next day the fitzgerald was in a gale capt ernest 
mcsorley reported topside damage and a list to his boat as 30foot 
waves crashed over the freighter 
just 15 miles short of the protection of whitefish bay mcsorley 
spoke by ships radio to the arthur m anderson another freighter 
struggling through the storm although the beacon light that marked 
the entrance to the bay had gone out both skippers were sure theyd 
make it 
we are holding our own mcsorley told the andersons crew 
shortly afterward the fitzgerald disappeared from radar screens 
without even a distress call no bodies and very little wreckage was 
found 
there are conflicting theories on how the fitzgerald sank 
whether water entered its hold through leaking hatch covers or it 
hit a shoal underwater divers later found that the ship went down 
with such force it broke in two 
the search robots first images wednesday were of a stark white 
bow rising crumpled and torn out of the blackness researchers were 
struck not by the damage but by the incongruity of a gleaming water 
cooler surrounded by overturned equipment in the pilothouse 
bill peckol of ashtabula ohio is eager to see the footage being 
filmed for a national geographic society television show hes 
already seen the snippets on newscasts 
naturally theyre not going to change anything that has 
happened said peckol whose 20yearold son karl died on the 
ship but maybe they can shed more light on what possibly 
happened 
bettie peckol remembers her relief when karl took a job on the 
fitzgerald transferring from a smaller and she thought more 
dangerous boat named sensibar 
the irony of it is the sensibar is still sailing said mrs 
peckol who skipped newscasts of the wreckage im not happy about 
opening up a lot of old wounds i guess you never forget the loss of 
a child 
plus i dont believe in living in the past i want to remember 
karl the way he was the last time i saw him 
that was nov 7 1975 he was waving goodbye

major third world countries are expected to 
fall nearly another 5 billion behind in the interest payments and 
us and other banks this year but unlike individual debtors 
theres no car to repossess and no home to foreclose on 
sovereign governments do not allow foreign bankers to seize the 
property of their citizens although sometimes lenders are allowed 
to buy up pieces of it in debtequity swaps 
fifteen countries singled out by the united states for special 
help will fall behind by another 4868 billion in their interest 
payments this year raising their arrears to a record 15079 
billion according to the banks which are owed the money 
brazil argentina and mexico owe the most according figures on 
the 15 major debtors compiled by the institute of international 
finance a group of the leading lending banks and made available to 
the associated press last week 
bankers know them as the baker 15 after secretary of state 
james a baker iii who made up the list in 1985 when he was 
secretary of the treasury most are in latin america but the list 
also includes nigeria the philippines and yugoslavia 
by the end of 1990 the 15 countries will owe about 524 billion 
to lending banks and governments with nearly another 50 billion in 
interest payments falling due most have not paid anything on the 
principal of their debt since the crisis began in 1982 
christian barrett an economist at the institute said falling 
behind on servicing the debt is a conscious policy of third world 
government leaders 
their governments need capital and thats the way they decide 
to get it barrett said but its a policy that discourages new 
lending from abroad and discourages their own citizens from bringing 
home the money theyve sent abroad 
more money has been leaving third world countries than has 
arrived in them this decade leaders of the debtor countries 
complain that the net outflow about 30 billion last year is 
unnatural and a major cause of their declining standards of living 
through the 1980s 
poverty has increased because of debt said finance minister 
bernard chidzero of zimbabwe whose country owes a modest 25 
billion and is not among the 15 major debtors 
malnutrition has increased as a result of more money going into 
debt service chidzero said there is a decline in social 
services because they cannot be maintained because people want to 
service debt and i think that is an untenable situation 
the interest payments are cited as a major factor in the net 
exodus but part of it also is due to their wealthy citizens putting 
their money in the united states switzerland and other safe havens 
much of this capital flight is illegal and there are no 
reliable figures on it 
barrett thinks that citizens of many debtor countries have 
stashed away assets abroad that approach or even exceed the value of 
their own countries debts to the commercial banks 
finance minister mailson nobrega of brazil which owes about 109 
billion and is the third worlds biggest debtor predicts there will 
be economic chaos if a solution is not found soon 
if we do not find a solution for the debt then it will be 
solved by itself through political turmoil through social unrest 
and then industrial nations will wake up and find a solution he 
said so it is better for them to help us find a solution now 
norbrega and chidzero made their comments on a program prepared 
by weta a public television station in washington the program will 
be broadcast sept 28 when the world bank and the international 
monetary fund hold their annual meetings here 
brazil and argentina pose two of the biggest problems brazil 
already has delayed some payments and the prospects are uncertain 
that it will make a 3 billion payment due next month 
brazilian leaders say they are not planning another stop on 
payments but the creditor banks say they expect the country to pile 
up another 700 million of interest arrears this year 
last year brazil caught up on its arrears through an agreement 
with the private banks and the multigovernment international 
monetary fund imf new loans were provided on the condition that 
brazils government reduce its own borrowing at home 
since then the imf has said that brazil failed to live up to the 
agreement and has halted further disbursement of the new loans many 
private banks followed suit what happens next depends largely on 
the results of brazils upcoming november election in which the debt 
burden is a major issue 
argentina where the new government of president carlos menem is 
settling in will owe about 686 billion at the end of this year 
according to the bankers institute of that 58 billion 
represents pastdue interest 
total debt of third world countries is estimated at 13 
trillion but many big debtors are not considered in financial 
trouble among them are india with a 602 billion china with 
424 billion and the soviet union with 393 billion 
for the troubled countries treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
has achieved a minor breakthrough by getting multigovernmentowned 
world bank and imf to effectively guarantee interest payments on new 
loans or reduced interest rates proffered by private banks in 
debtreduction agreements 
so far deals have been struck with mexico and the philippines 
but it is uncertain how much the arrangements will actually reduce 
borrowers debtservice costs 
many fear the debtor nations will be left only further in the 
red and some influential governments are skeptical that their 
taxpayers will be stuck for the world bank and imf guarantees if and 
when the deals sour

independence a year ago only a few 
former political prisoners dared whisper the word in the nations 
three baltic republics 
today it is the goal of a mass movement putting the three tiny 
lands in direct conflict with the kremlin 
on wednesday a 370mile chain of determined baltic families 
stood hand in hand protesting the soviet annexation of their 
independent nations but that was just the most dramatic 
manifestation of a profound change that has occurred in recent 
months on the soviet unions western frontier 
the activist groups of estonia latvia and lithuania known as 
the peoples front once worked for more authority within the soviet 
union now they are openly calling for restoration of their free 
nations 
the declarations of the peoples front in the past year have 
become ever closer to the ideals our people have carried in their 
hearts for all these 50 years estonian peoples front leader and 
lawmaker marju lauristin said 
all of us would like to have freedom and freedom without 
independence isnt realistic she said 
from the kremlins point of view it is baltic independence 
thats unrealistic and a sharply worded statement from the 
communist party central committee on saturday made that point clear 
things have gone far serious danger is threatening the baltic 
peoples the policymaking body said people should know what 
abyss their nationalist leaders are pushing them toward 
if they managed to attain their goals the consequences could 
be catastrophic for their people their very ability to survive 
could come under question it said the statement was carried on 
national television 
not long ago such a warning from the central committee would 
have sent shudders through many activists on sunday it did little 
more than raise eyebrows in the baltics yet another indication of 
how far the region has come in establishing for itself an identity 
outside the soviet union 
we expected this said raimona sakalouskis a spokeswoman for 
the lithuanian activist group but leaders of the peoples front 
movements didnt interrupt their weekend plans to discuss the 
statement 
the radicalization of the fronts is backed by more than 2 million 
people who signed documents implying they want freedom from the 
soviet union 
in lithuania 13 million people have signed petitions saying the 
soviet union annexed their nation against the will of 
lithuanians it demands removal of the soviet occupation army 
and seeks un supervision of free elections for a new baltic 
government 
in latvia 430000 people have registered themselves as desiring 
to be considered citizens of an independent latvia 
in estonia more than 400000 have signed petitions asking the 
estonian parliament to declare illegal the 1940 estonian 
parliaments approval of the soviet annexation that legislature was 
elected under soviet occupation and only communists were allowed to 
run 
for the kremlin the baltics are frontline territory home to 
missile bases naval and army units and vital ports activists say 
one in eight people in estonia is a soviet soldier 
soviet television called the idea of redrawing boundaries 
political naivete in its coverage of wednesdays protest 
independence itll never happen said a tallinn taxi 
driver the son of a russianestonian marriage the economy is a 
wreck and hopes of developing a new tourist industry fail to take 
into consideration the cold damp baltic climate he said 
significant opposition to independence also has come from the 27 
million russians and other nonbaltic people among the 8 million 
baltic residents 
yet amid the pride and determination exhibited by the tens of 
thousands of estonians holding hands on the crest of tallinns 
toompea hill on wednesday evening independence seemed possible 
in the past year the baltics have waged a parliamentary and 
legal struggle taking full advantage of each step toward democracy 
permitted by the kremlin each move has run into condemnation in 
moscow giving way to grudging acceptance and a new push by the 
baltics 
estonia made international headlines in november when it claimed 
the right to overturn soviet laws the kremlin declared the move 
invalid but estonia has not backed down 
a plan for economic autonomy greeted with derision two years ago 
has been approved in principle by the new soviet legislature recent 
strikes by russians in estonia over a voter residency law disturbed 
activists but the kremlin refrained from issuing orders and strove 
for a peaceful compromise 
alvydas medalinskas a leader of the lithuanian activist group 
sajudis said it would not now exist if it had spoken of 
independence even in january 
on wednesday the sajudis council pushed again it voted to call 
for creation of an independent democratic lithuanian republic not 
under the power of the soviet union 
a day earlier the lithuanian parliament passed a resolution 
calling the soviet annexation an international crime 
in latvia the peoples front will take a formal vote soon at its 
congress on changing its platform to full independence said 
chairman ianis freimanis

researchers have found lightning to be an even 
more widespread danger than was believed with more than five dozen 
americans losing their lives and hundreds more injured by lightning 
last year 
a hazard whose scattered victims usually attract only local 
notice lightning finally made the national headlines in 1988 by 
sparking forest fires that ravaged much of yellowstone national park 
in the past weather observers have recorded the presence of 
lightning through the simple expedient of listening for the thunder 
that comes after the electrical discharges 
but electromagnetic detection systems have discovered that 
because of interference with sound waves between 22 percent and 40 
percent of all lightning occurs without observers hearing the 
thunder that follows 
that is not good news researchers note pointing out that 
lightning can strike with no warning sometimes occuring prior to 
storms or reaching out ahead of the clouds 
detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s but they 
have always depended on the reports of trained observers primarily 
listening to thunder this means that the operators of electrical 
plants and others who use weather records to anticipate the danger 
of lightning have underestimated the risk 
the toll of 68 lightning deaths in 1988 was the same number as in 
1986 tying for the lowest in this decade in between however 1987 
recorded the most in the decade with 86 fatalities 
the longterm average is 96 lightning deaths annually an average 
boosted by several very deadly years back in the 1960s including 
1963 when 210 people were killed by lightning 
as usual in 1988 many victims were in the open or under trees 
with several on golf courses or in boats florida retained its place 
as leading in lightning deaths with nine while six died in colorado 
there were four lightning deaths in georgia michigan new york 
north carolina and wisconsin the national weather service reported 
and states with three fatalities were minnesota new mexico texas 
and virginia 
alabama kansas louisiana oklahoma pennsylvania and puerto 
rico had two lightning deaths each states reporting one fatality 
last year were arizona connecticut kentucky nebraska nevada new 
hampshire new jersey ohio and south carolina 
more than half of all electrical storms had only a few 
cloudtoground lightning flashes while a small number of storms 
had hundreds of strokes 
indeed in washington dc three years worth of records showed 
that nearly onequarter of all the lightning strokes were accounted 
for in just two big storms 
one reason lightning doesnt get the respect that meteorologists 
think it deserves is that it is like automobile accidents usually 
claiming victims one or two at a time over a scattered area 
the sudden arrival of thousands of volts of electricity however 
can sometimes involve a lot of people 
for example on july 17 1988 lightning struck a utility pole at 
a speedway in snyder county pa twentytwo spectators were injured 
by the charge which traveled down the pole and into the bleachers 
happily no one was killed 
on july 10 of last year a group playing volleyball in new yorks 
prospect park wasnt so fortunate seeking to avoid a sudden 
downpour they sought shelter under a tree lightning struck 
killing a 28yearold man and injuring a dozen others 
lightning results from a buildup of electrical charges in a storm 
cloud the process isnt fully understood but is appears to involve 
movement of raindrops up and down in the cloud propelled by strong 
winds 
when the electrical charges build up to large levels an invisible 
step leader moves down from the negatively charged cloud base in 
segments about 50 yards long until it reaches the positively 
charged ground 
when that contact is made thousands of volts of electricity move 
in that circuit often in several bolts giving lightning its 
sometimes flickering character

a fundamentalist church group improperly 
spent 117000 earmarked for a lowincome housing project here and 
tried to evade government rules in order to sell the building at an 
enormous profit hud records and court documents show 
the sale of the concord a 150unit highrise building was 
halted through the persistence of tenants who feared they would be 
evicted or their rents would triple lawyers familiar with the case 
said 
the tenants urged the inspector general at the department of 
housing and urban development to conduct an audit which found 
117787 in project funds were improperly spent by the concords 
owner community churches of america 
among other things hud found that concord funds were used to pay 
church group officers and purchase two vans used for church events 
the housing agency eventually reached a settlement with the group on 
the misspent money 
the glendalebased fundamentalist group first tried to sell the 
apartment building in 1982 for 55 million after paying off the 
balance of a 205 million hud loan to the original developer 
congress has since prohibited prepayment of hud loans unless the 
housing secretary finds that existing tenants are protected from 
eviction or higher rents 
community churches tried again in 1985 to sell the building for 
55 million under the protection of a bankruptcy reorganization 
but the bankruptcy sale was blocked after objections were raised by 
tenants church creditors and hud lawyers according to court 
records on file in nearby los angeles 
community churches was headed by the rev william s mcbirnie a 
charismatic preacher community churches acquired the concord in 
1979 and organized a nonprofit foundation to run the building in 
accordance with hud regulations the building was erected in 1966 to 
provide subsidized housing for the elderly and handicapped 
but there were problems from the outset said clements gordon 
81 a former building manager who spearheaded the tenants fight 
mcbirnie planned to use the concord to house his own parishioners 
and the loyal listeners to his anticommunist radio broadcasts 
voice of americanism she said 
by 1982 mcbirnie decided to sell the concord because we were 
constantly being frustrated at making improvements in the building 
and not being able to do the good work that we had intended he 
said in a legal declaration he did not return a reporters 
telephone call seeking comment 
huds decision to allow the prepayment was very suspect said 
ben logan a los angeles lawyer representing the buildings tenants 
after the hud loan was repaid the agency lost its regulatory 
control over the building 
even the churchs lawyer philip mcnutt acknowledged the idea 
of hud authorizing this prepayment for the benefit of a private 
owner was a real political hot potato at the time 
tenants asked hud about the legality of the sale and were told 
hud regulations did not prohibit community churches group from 
paying off its loan early mrs gordon said 
of course hud was concerned over the impact upon existing 
tenants hud deputy assistant secretary philip abrams wrote mrs 
gordon in july 1982 we insisted upon an agreement by the project 
owners that all existing tenants would have the opportunity to 
remain in occupancy without interference by the new owner until 
such time as they may freely choose to leave 
but in testimony about a week later before the house select 
committee on aging abrams conceded the sale was authorized before 
hud received any written pledge from mcbirnies group guaranteeing 
the residents life tenancy 
the primary concern of the tenants was that they were going to 
be evicted or that their rents were going to be raised so high they 
were going to have to leave mcnutt said but that was never 
reflected in reality 
in august 1982 mrs gordon and other tenants filed suit to block 
the sale of the concord 
there was intense pressure to settle because mcbirnies groups 
had obtained a shortterm loan at high interest to pay off the hud 
loan mcnutt said mcbirnies groups had used the shortterm loan 
because they intended to sell the building immediately but their 
plan was thwarted by the tenants lawsuit logan said 
the deal essentially was shoved down the foundations throat 
because it was either lose the building through foreclosure or 
accept the governments offer mcnutt said as a result a 1983 
settlement was reached that included a new 26 million hud loan on 
the building and again hudimposed rules on its operations 
new trouble surfaced in may 1985 when a los angeles county 
superior court issued a 128 million default judgment against 
mcbirnies church groups in a suit that alleged 26 people were 
defrauded after investing about 200000 in loans for new church 
facilities eventually 380 creditors filed lawsuits claiming they 
were owed as much as 37 million 
the next month community churches filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization in washington dc eventually listing the concord 
as a major asset in the bankruptcy proceeding mcnutt proposed to 
satisfy creditors by selling the concord to the same buyer lined up 
in the 1982 deal 
the resurrected sale of the concord in bankruptcy court was 
just a transparent attempt to do in bankruptcy court what the civil 
suits and the congressional hearings had prevented earlier logan 
said 
after the case was transferred to los angeles the bankruptcy 
court appointed an independent trustee to supervise the 
reorganization 
three more years of legal maneuvering ended july 31 with a deal 
that closed the sale of the concord for 135 million and assumption 
of the 22 million remaining on the hud loan 
the new owner the retirement housing foundation has pledged to 
operate the building according to hud regulations

waiters in italian restaurants in this country 
get the biggest tips from customers while those in mexican eateries 
fare the worst the internal revenue service has found 
the average tip in italian restaurants in 1986 was 158 percent 
compared with 15 percent in chinese restaurants and 148 percent in 
mexican restaurants according to an irs study 
on the other hand patrons in chinese restaurants were more 
likely to leave a tip 90 out of every 100 did than in italian 
restaurants where only 88 saw fit to leave something 
in restaurants serving mexican food there were 86 tips for every 
100 customers 
the study did not try to give any reason for the differences nor 
did it ask about restaurants that serve the foods of other countries 
at least one waiter at a small italian restaurant in georgetown 
a popular washington restaurant area agreed that he got better tips 
there than in other places he had worked 
its the european atmosphere explained mouez zemni who 
comes not from italy but from tunisia on the other side of the 
mediterranean 
theres the european flair people like the atmosphere and it 
relaxes them it doesnt even matter about the food i dont like 
italian food much myself i think french food is much better 
at a bigger and pricier italian place the maitre d was not so 
sure about high tips 
some people come in here with a couple of kids and leave a 
dollar said julio estrada about 20 to 25 percent dont leave 
anything 
a waiter at a mexican restaurant would not agree that his tips 
were inferior 
its a matter of food and service he insisted a little 
stiffly if a customer gets good food and good service he tips 
well 
what started the irs investigation is that waiters are required 
by law to include tips in their earnings and pay income tax on them 
underreporting of tip income has long been a concern thomas 
a thompson an irs researcher wrote in his report on the situation 
so the service hired the survey research laboratory of the 
university of illinois to query its panel of nearly 13000 
households both families and individuals they kept records of 
their tips over twoweek periods between 1983 and 1986 
the diary approach used in this study was adopted on the ground 
that tipping information obtained from people leaving tips is likely 
to be more accurate than data obtained from tip recipients 
thompson said 
before narrowing the survey down to ethnic restaurants the study 
tried other classifications with labels that included familytype 
restaurants and atmospherespecialty 
restaurants that turned out to be too vague 
people tipped more in restaurants that accepted credit cards and 
those that served alcohol patronage at what the report called 
tiptype restaurants declined between 1983 and 1986 but tipping 
stayed level there was a shift to establishments where people do 
not normally leave tips 
total eatin and carryout occasions at hamburger pizza and 
chicken places increased from 406 million in 1983 to 477 million 
in 1986 an increase of more than 17 percent the study said

austrian officials on sunday said about 
180 east germans had crossed the hungarian border in a 24hour 
period despite increased attempts by hungarian officials to stop 
them 
in hamburg west germanys welt am sonntag newspaper reported 
that hungarian officials told their west german counterparts that 
there was rising soviet and east german concern about the stream of 
east germans fleeing through hungary 
bonn officials meanwhile told west german radio that hungary 
had repeated assurances that no east german now in hungary would be 
sent back against his will 
austrian police officials in eisenstadt about 10 miles north of 
the border said that new refugees were arriving despite hungarian 
attempts to keep cars with east german license plates away from the 
boundary the austrian press agency reported the officials were 
quoted as saying about 180 had crossed since saturday 
all east german cars approaching nagycenk two miles east of the 
border and 20 miles south of eisenstadt were being turned back by 
police several refugees were quoted as saying 
east germans frustrated with the lack of domestic political or 
economic reforms and unable to emigrate legally to the west began 
fleeing through hungary into austria early this summer their final 
goal is west germany which considers them citizens 
the border between hungary and austria is relatively easy to 
cross hungary a reformminded soviet bloc country removed barbed 
wire and other barriers from the border in april in a symbolic 
opening to the west 
because hungary is an allied communist country east germans can 
visit relatively easily west german authorities estimate that more 
than 5000 have fled through hungary since july 
hundreds of others refuse to leave west german diplomatic 
property in budapest unless guaranteed safe passage to the west 
likeminded east germans are crowding west german embassies 
consulates and missions in east berlin and prague czechoslovakia 
hungary facing pressure from east germany tightened controls 
after east germans massed in groups of as many as 500 and stormed 
border points authorities in budapest announced friday that border 
guards would be bolstered by armed units of the workers militia 
but hungary is also interested in west german support as it 
strives to improve its trading status with west european countries 
and seeks convertible currency to modernize its economy 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn told hungarian tv late 
saturday his government cannot guarantee east german officials that 
all those caught trying to escape through hungary will be returned 
home 
horn spoke after returning from bonn where he and hungarian 
premier miklos nemeth met with chancellor helmut kohl and foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher hungarys official news agency mti 
said the talks focused on hungarian trade ties to the european 
economic community and on the refugee problem 
the refugee situation has resulted in months of bad publicity for 
east germany and welt am sonntag said nemeth told west german 
officials that hungary was under increasing pressure from east 
berlin and moscow to resolve the problem the paper did not 
elaborate 
the newspaper said hungarian officials estimate that about 20000 
of the 200000 east germans now vacationing in the country will seek 
to flee to the west 
west german officials have urged east germanys hardline 
leadership to implement economic and political reforms to help stem 
the flow of fleeing east germans

security forces will begin stopping people on the 
streets and checking their identification papers in a new effort to 
round up dissidents the official beijing daily said sunday 
starting friday residents must carry identification papers 
whenever they leave home to be prepared for examination the 
paper said drivers licenses also will be examined 
counterrevolutionary elements have not been thoroughly cleaned 
up and motor vehicles often are used as tools of crimes the paper 
said therefore the martial law troops and police must according 
to the law stengthen inspections of motor vehicles and drivers 
the order runs counter to a recent although gradual lessening 
of the security presence on streets of the capital since the june 
34 military crackdown on prodemocracy protesters 
martial law imposed may 20 remains in effect but most army 
checkpoints on city streets have been removed soldiers stand guard 
only around tiananmen square the former center of the protests and 
at key overpasses and intersections 
however local authorities appear concerned that college students 
and others who joined the seven weeks of demonstrations will use the 
oct 1 anniversary of 40 years of communist rule to stage some kind 
of protest 
public anger over the army attack on the protesters in which 
hundreds or perhaps thousands were killed remains deep although 
most people remain outwardly quiescent for fear of arrest or censure 
thousands of people have been arrested since the june crackdown 
some disappearing with no word to their families 
the hardline officials who led the crackdown have shown no sign 
of easing their attacks on the ideological front 
beijing mayor chen xitong and communist party secretary li ximing 
instructed local officials in a series of meetings last week to keep 
up the fight against bourgeois liberalism or western liberal 
thought 
they ordered leaders in all work units to mobilize the masses 
to make reports and expose clues to the identification of 
counterrevolutionary elements 
the greatest danger in inspection work is to pause to treat 
big matters as small and let small matters go to give up half 
way li told one meeting according to a beijing daily report 
our party and nation still face a lifeanddeath problem 
beijing residents say there have been relatively few cases of 
neighbors reporting on neighbors as was common in the 196676 
leftist cultural revolution and earlier political campaigns they 
say many work units are quietly covering for members who took part 
in the protests and even some police are reported to be dragging 
their feet in making arrests 
national party chief jiang zemin and education minister li 
tieying showed concern about the mood on campuses by visiting 
students at one of the capitals leading schools qinghua university 
sundays national and local newspapers quoted jiang as assuring a 
group of qinghua students in a fourhour meeting friday that the 
partys current policy of classing intellectuals among the working 
class would not change during the first decades of communist rule 
intellectuals were not classed with workers but were instead 
vilified as bourgeois 
jiang said most students are fervent patriots but said they lack 
political experience and too easily become conceited over their 
successes and discouraged over obstacles 
a college student interviewed recently in beijing said the 
despite the appearance of normalcy people are scared 
theres no law any more no legal protection they can just 
come and take you away said the student 
many say they fear the soldiers others fear the telephone 
hotlines and the boxes in every work unit to report people to the 
authorities 
one man noted that any one could put a neighbors name in a box 
and accuse him of throwing stones at soldiers and the police would 
come to arrest him 
he like many other people told of friends who were hauled away 
beaten and interrogated the police beat first and ask questions 
later he said 
beijing residents also worry about the miles of footage shot 
during the weeks of demonstrations by police crews and cameras 
mounted on main streets police now are studying the film and many 
people wonder if their faces will be found 
one elderly man persecuted during the cultural revolution was 
asked by a foreigner how the police could find a single person in 
beijings population of about 10 million 
he waved his hand and looked away impatiently to show what a 
silly question that was

this city has gained national preeminence 
in waste no not frivolous spending but real human waste 
the environmental protection agency has bestowed the national 
award for beneficial reuse of sludge on austin 
ron bond acting director of the citys wastewater treatment 
department said last week it may be sludge to you but its our 
bread and butter its a resource 
through a complicated and smelly scientific process austin 
turns its 250 tons of sludge per month into fertilizer for city park 
grass and crops that feed cattle 
the city also turns human waste into compost which has been 
dubbed dillo dirt to entice residents to pay for something they 
flushed down the toilet three months ago 
bond said dillo dirt was selected because calling it human 
doodoo wouldnt have been too appetizing dillo is short for 
armadillo in honor of the critters that proliferate in the texas 
countryside 
bond credits engineer jim doersam as the person most 
responsible for the success of the dillo dirt program 
doersam said the epa award shows austin has turned a nasty 
situation around for 30 years the city disposed of its sludge in 
large lagoons by the early part of this decade austin was 
kneedeep in something and it wasnt civic pride 
you can only put so much sludge in a pond before it comes back 
to haunt you which it did he said 
doersam who friends call the sludge guru says hes thrilled 
about the epa award and thinks the chamber of commerce might have 
something new to brag about 
this will attract a lot of visitors he said

its a bugeatbug world for jack blehm 
and son 
jack and jake blehm breed good insects to eat bad insects at 
rincon vitova one of a group of 15 insectaria nationwide every 
day rincon produces more than 80 million voracious critters from 
ladybugs to wasps 
business at rincon vitova has tripled in the past five years as 
farmers concerned about the effects of pesticides are turning to 
natural alternatives 
in 1988 alone the blehms say they supplied millions of dollars 
worth of natural predators to customers across three continents 
the 15 insectaria have sales totaling 25 million annually the 
blehms estimate 
most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers plus back 
yard farmers 
some colleges and universities are adding classes on integrated 
pest management ways of holding down troublesome pests while 
minimizing the use of pesticides the association of applied insect 
ecologists a trade group is producing a video that shows farmers 
how to work with beneficial insects 
this is the future added ken hagen a professor of 
entomology at the university of california berkeley there is a 
great need the farmers are desperate 
state agriculture officials estimate less than 10 percent of the 
golden states growers use the method controlling pests with 
beneficial insects takes longer and because pesticides kill good 
bugs along with bad farmers are forced to stop chemical spraying 
while waiting for the good bugs to do their duty 
the hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith 
jake blehm said hes not used to seeing pests in the field hes 
used to a quick knockdown 
with this method you have to watch for several weeks before 
you see a difference and at the beginning all the farmer sees is 
that his crop is contaminated with bugs 
rincon vitova sells 15 species including beetles mites and 
parasitic wasps that help control flies around chickens and cattle 
jack blehm a licensed pest control adviser provided the 
business and production expertise his partner ej dietrick an 
entomologist formerly with the biological control division at uc 
riverside provided the field knowhow 
the company employs about 40 workers during peak season from 
april to september the insects are grown in a series of former ship 
cargo containers 
rincon vitova even sells bugs to movie makers last summer a 
studio filming a horror movie placed a request for four gallons of 
maggots we shipped them federal express to their location site in 
montana jake blehm said 
more than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced 
into american agriculture in the past 100 years to curb pest 
populations according to the us department of agriculture which 
must approve the insects for use before insectaria start breeding 
and releasing them

the panamanian government which has 
resisted every us attempt to oust de facto ruler manuel antonio 
noriega is making new claims that washington is preparing to invade 
foreign minister jorge ritter said saturday there is a true 
danger of a us invasion to oust noriega who heads panamas 
defense forces 
speaking to reporters ritter said the united states has used 
military maneuvers allowed under the 1977 panama canal treaties to 
shield its preparations 
if all the preliminary steps to an invasion have been taken 
the only thing left is the definitive step he said without 
elaborating 
the united states has been trying to dislodge noriega for 18 
months it has indicted the general for drug trafficking slapped 
crippling economic sanctions on panama and tried to muster 
diplomatic support from other latin american countries 
the us pressures will continue said an embassy official on 
condition of anonymity there can be no accommodation with a 
regime that includes noriega 
the united states has frozen panamanian government assets in us 
banks and withheld more than 300 million in panama canal funds the 
panamanian government now has trouble meeting payrolls unemployment 
is more than 20 percent and economic activity has fallen by nearly 
a third 
this is a government that survives by lurching from one payday 
to the next said one american source 
in addition noriegas domestic opponents have mounted general 
strikes and huge demonstrations international observers say the 
opposition beat noriegas candidate in may presidential elections 
that noriega annuled 
despite the pressure noriega has remained in power and even 
scored some diplomatic victories 
last week the organization of american states blamed the united 
states for the lack of progress in its negotiations on a sept 1 
change of government the organization did not even mention noriega 
by name 
the defiant general survived a march coup and purged the defense 
forces of disloyal elements he has wrapped himself in a nationalist 
banner and profited from the strong latin american aversion to 
anything that smacks of outside interference especially from the 
united states 
on saturday the government took the offensive against its 
domestic opponents closing three opposition party newspapers it 
also said it will arrest their editors and confiscate equipment used 
to publish them 
all the papers have called for noriegas ouster 
the big question is what the united states will do now 
according to noriega the attempt to oust him is a thinly 
disguised plot for the united states to renege on the 1977 treaties 
that turn the panana canal over to panama at the end of the century 
if anything the 51yearold general appeared more relaxed than 
ever when he showed up for an agricultural fair on a military base 
about 80 miles southwest of panama city last week dressed in 
civilian clothes noriega drank beer with fairgoers and strolled 
around greeting crowds of wellwishers 
his power base is the defense forces which controls everything 
from traffic to city police to customs it even acts as local 
government in many small towns dispensing municipal largesse such 
as roads and other public works projects 
the 14000man defense forces is the only armed panamanian 
authority in the country 
the united states which has said all options are on the table 
when it comes to removing noriega has about 12000 troops in panama 
under the canal treaties gen marc cisneros head of the us 
southern command has said he favors military action against noriega 
and he has stepped up the pace of military maneuvers 
we will continue to reaffirm our rights under the terms of the 
canal treaties and to defend us lives and property and let the 
chips fall where they may said us embassy deputy chief of 
mission john maisto in an interview 
several times in the past few months panamanian and us 
soldiers have pointed weapons at each other alleging violations of 
the treaties 
i would not discount a desperate suicide action by cisneros 
before sept 1 defense forces spokesman maj edgardo lopez 
grimaldo said in an interview it could be a military invasion or 
a terrorist act 
the noriegacontrolled government is expected to form a junta to 
take over sept 1 the date the constitution says a new president 
should take office 
the opposition in what noriega called a historic stupidity 
has refused to take part in any junta demanding noriegas departure 
and recognition that it won the may 7 elections

unlikely

transmitter but it has to be activated manually by survivors no 
signals have been picked up in the area said pota 
none of pias fleet of 11 fokker27s is equipped with an 
automatic locator he said 
deteriorating weather hampered search efforts sunday a thick 
cloud cover blanketed the valleys of the karakorum said airline 
spokesman ah sarooqi 
we have seen many a tragedy in this area both for pia and the 
military he said four aircraft a fokker27 a dc3 and two 
military c130s have crashed in the area since 1963 
its very treacherous and inhospitable terrain said pota

the soviet unions first beauty queen says her 
fantasy of being named the countrys most beautiful woman has turned 
into an ugly nightmare of threats and blackmail by unscrupulous 
organizers 
organizers of the miss ussr pageant have threatened to strip 
her of the title and send another contestant to the miss world 
contest if she doesnt knuckle under to their contract demands 
which 17yearold yulia sukhanova termed bondage 
in three months of torment i have lived through so many 
humiliations disappointments and accusations that im simply amazed 
i havent lost my mind miss sukhanova of moscow said in a 
letter published sunday in the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya 
miss sukhanova said the director of the venets organization 
refused to allow her to bring a chaperone on any travels abroad with 
him because he wanted to be alone with her she also accused him of 
blocking business offers from the west from reaching her and of 
sabotaging the one deal she managed to put together herself 
miss sukhanova who said she wants a career in advertising was 
chosen as the first miss ussr from among 35 contestants by a 
panel of judges and by a television audience which voted by 
telephone 
before the pageants final on may 21 the venets organization 
insisted by way of threats and blackmail that the girls sign an 
agreement of bondage limiting their rights and legal 
capabilities miss sukhanova wrote 
some of the contestants refused to sign but she did she said 
however after she won miss sukhanova and her mother went to 
venets director yuri s kushnerev and said the contract was invalid 
because she is a minor 
they offered to negotiate a new contract under which her mother 
and a longtime acquaintance would travel with her until she reaches 
18 she accused kushnerev of rejecting that proposal because he was 
interested in making unescorted trips with the pageant contestants 
miss sukhanova accused kushnerev of blocking any business or 
travel proposals from reaching her while he was negotiating in the 
united states on her behalf 
at the same time she charged he constantly told me and my 
family that there was no interest in me among western agencies and 
that i wouldnt go anywhere at all if i didnt sign the contract 
with him 
miss sukhanova said she did manage to find another outlet to the 
west through the moscow cultural fund and signed a fiveyear 
agreement with an unidentified american company on july 7 
she was preparing to leave for the united states on aug 13 when 
kushnerev through his lawyer openly promised to use all his 
contacts all the way to the communist party central committee to 
make sure i would never go anywhere 
the moscow cultural fund hastily retreated and the trip to the 
united states is off she said 
she appealed to the newspaper for help 
the soviet union for decades has frowned on beauty contests as an 
example of the wests exploitation of women but reforms instituted 
by president mikhail s gorbachev have opened the way for more 
diversity and that has included the establishment of several beauty 
contestants

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani on 
sunday opened a parliamentary debate on his proposed cabinet by 
defending his decision to drop religious hardliners 
he asked parliament deputies to fairly evaluate the technocrats 
he has nominated earlier reports said 138 of 270 deputies had 
petitioned rafsanjani to keep interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi who leads the hardline faction 
the debate in the majlis or parliament was expected to end 
tuesday with a secret ballot on each of rafsanjanis candidates a 
majority vote is needed on each of the 22 nominees 
tehran radio reported that rafsanjani made an hourlong speech 
sunday in defense of ousting the hardliners who also included 
prime minister hussein musavi 
the hardliners favor a statecontrolled economy they also 
believe that by confronting the west the government feeds islamic 
fervor and remains loyal to the policy of its founder ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini who died on june 3 
mohtashemi helped establish hezbollah or party of god among 
young shiite moslem militants in lebanon the group now is believed 
to be an umbrella for extremists holding most of the 16 western 
hostages in lebanon 
as leader of the socalled pragmatists rafsanjani is seeking to 
restore ties with the west to ensure a flow of foreign technology 
and financing badly needed to rebuild the countrys economy he also 
wants to boost the private sector to help iran recover from eight 
years of war with iraq that ended last year 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted rafsanjani as saying 
he looked forward to a fair nonaligned assessment of his 
proposed cabinet 
i feel very proud in front of god that i have succeeded 
despite the pressures and propaganda to present to you what i 
think is in favor of the country the revolution and islam he 
said 
in addition to rafsanjani 20 deputies were expected to make 
comments on the nominees 
the proposed cabinet which includes several young intellectuals 
has nine newcomers 
nine other nominees are already serving in the cabinet the rest 
worked for previous governments after the 1979 islamic revolution 
ended 2500 years of monarchy 
the englishlanguage tehran times newspaper which backs 
rafsanjani said in an editorial sunday it is almost certain that 
the 22member cabinet proposed by mr rafsanjani will receive a vote 
of confidence from the majlis 
in his speech rafsanjani made reference to support for 
mohtashemi he appealed that the deputies not be carried away by 
the poisonous propaganda of the enemies and he added mr 
mohtashemi is one of my closest friends and i have known him for 
very many years 
however he said he believed his nominee for interior minister 
nateq nouri is best for this job 
nouri served as interior minister from 19811985 
defending the newcomers against criticism that they lack 
political experience the 55yearold president said with my 
presence the cabinet would be political enough

twentythree years ago an air india 
jetliner bound for new york with 117 people aboard slammed into 
europes second highest mountain killing everyone aboard including 
a noted nuclear physicist 
a search at the time found part of one wing and a piece of 
fuselage but not the flight recorder and the cause of the crash 
remains a mystery 
on friday a guide climbing on mount blancs miage glacier found 
more of the wreckage prompting police to return to the mountain for 
another look 
italian newspapers said sunday that the mountain guide renzino 
cosson found pieces of the planes fuselage as well as clothing 
shoes and a bag inscribed with the words fly india 
cosson was searching at the time for objects that might help 
identify three mountain climbers whose bodies were found in the ice 
two weeks ago he said the climbers may have been killed by an 
avalanche more than 30 years ago 
i am convinced that next summer we will find much more 
material the glacier at this point is like the mouth of a river 
said cosson 
it would be useless to search now it is necessary to wait 
until the black box if it still exists emerges from the ice he 
said referring to the device that records flight information 
nevertheless police said they would climb the mountain sunday 
examine the wreckage and determine if they can recover some of the 
victims remains 
the boeing 707 slammed into the side of mount blanc which 
straddles the frenchitalian border on the jan 24 1966 
the victims included physicist homi jehangir bhabab head of the 
indian atomic energy commission it is not known if americans were 
aboard 
the flight to new york originated in bombay and included stops in 
new dehli beirut geneva and london 
the plane crashed into the french side of the mountain at the 
15344foot level just 30 minutes before its scheduled landing in 
geneva and two minutes after the pilot was given permission to 
descend to 18700 feet 
the pieces of wreckage cosson found friday had been carried by 
the glacier to the 8530foot level of the the italian side of the 
mountain 
the accident may have been caused by a fault in the planes 
altimeter or an error by the pilot who was beginning his descent for 
a landing at geneva

a soviet envoy on a lebanese peace mission 
has proposed that syria and israel both withdraw soldiers from 
lebanon and a presidential election be held arab diplomatic sources 
said sunday 
envoy gennady tarasov has been trying to sell his proposal during 
talks in lebanon jordan and syria a key soviet ally the sources 
said 
his talks represented one of several diplomatic efforts under way 
sunday to end months of fierce fighting between christians and 
syrian forces 
on sunday beirut gun battles between christian army units and 
syrian forces allied with moslem militias flamed anew sixteen 
people were reported injured 
the latest casualties raised the toll to at least 796 killed and 
2247 wounded since the latest round of the 14yearold civil war 
broke out march 8 
in another development a radical iranian newspaper said pope 
john paul ii should not visit lebanon because he would offend 
moslems lebanons maronite catholic leader said such a visit could 
prove helpful to moslems and catholics 
tarasov arrived in amman jordan on sunday on the soviet mission 
aimed at a lebanese truce 
at the same time foreign minister farouk alsharaa of syria 
wound up meetings on lebanon with jordanian officials 
syrian troops in lebanon who number about 40000 were sent 
under terms of a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
the arab diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said tarasov was seeking a compromise that would allow the arab 
league to reactivate a stalemated peace effort 
under his formula syrian forces would pull out of moslem west 
beirut and the central mountains to the bekaa valley in east lebanon 
while a presidential election in lebanon was arranged to end a 
yearold political deadlock the sources reported syrian troops 
control most of the country outside the christian sector 
tarasov is suggesting a compromise under which the syrian 
pullback would be tied to an israeli pullout from a border enclave 
in south lebanon one source said 
the israeli army has occupied a selfdeclared security zone 
in south lebanon since israel withdrew most of its forces in 
mid1985 three years after invading lebanon 
the diplomatic source said tarasov has received encouraging 
responses from christian army commander michel aoun and other 
involved parties but that the soviets will ask the united states to 
pressure israel to agree to the plan 
aoun who has vowed to force the syrians out of lebanon was 
named head of an interim cabinet by outgoing president amin gemayel 
in september a deadlock between moslem and christian politicans 
blocked election of a successor by lawmakers 
aoun now is vying for power with a syrianbacked moslem 
government headed by acting prime minister salim hoss 
in still another peace effort king hussein of jordan flew into 
cairo egypt on sunday for an afternoon of talks dealing with 
lebanon and other regional issues the egyptian governments middle 
east news agency said the monarch immediately began meeting with 
president hosni mubarak 
the tehranbased newspaper jomhuri islami was quoted as saying if 
the pope visits lebanon he would be supporting aoun 
the roman catholic leader said last week he would like to 
undertake a peace mission to lebanon but no date has been set the 
vatican has said a final decision will depend on security conditions 
in beirut 
the french government said it sent its six warships led by the 
aircraft carrier foch to evacuate 7000 french citizens if the 
situation worsens 
in paris the navy announced sunday that a french helicopter 
crashed near the foch during a routine flight and the two crewmen 
were missing it said the cause of saturdays crash was unknown

sinhalese radicals called sunday for a 
weeklong strike against the government ignoring a peace appeal by 
major opposition groups 
posters put up in colombo by the radicals said the strike was to 
protest alleged genocide by the government the posters in the 
sinhalese language asked people to stay indoors and not open shops 
and businesses starting monday 
other posters believed to have been put up by progovernment 
groups said anyone who heeded the strike call would be treated as a 
traitor 
on saturday five major opposition parties appealed to the 
government and the radicals to end their bloody war 
fear stalks every home and peace is a thing of the past a 
statement issued by the parties said despair gloom and fear 
pervades the entire country the slaughter disappearances and 
arrests of our citizens and the escalation of crime have become a 
way of life 
the statement demanded the establishment of a provisional 
allparty government that would include the radicals and holding of 
new elections 
there has been no response from the government of president 
ranasinghe premadasa who was elected in december his united 
national party won a majority in parliamentary polls held in 
february 
at least 5000 people have been killed in the 2yearold campaign 
by sinhalese ultranationalists and officials say 1130 of the 
killings have taken place in the last six weeks there has been no 
explanation for the spurt of violence 
human rights organizations and opposition politicians say many of 
the victims have been suspected radicals shot after capture by 
security forces in past weeks military officials have reported 
scores of unidentified bodies turning up in various parts of the 
island every day 
sinhalese radicals began fighting the sinhalesedominated 
government after a july 1987 peace accord with tamil militants 
fighting for an independent nation in the north and east 
the radicals say the agreement gave too many concessions to the 
minority tamils and infringed on sri lankas sovereignity by 
inviting indian soldiers to implement it 
india the dominant military power in the region sponsored the 
agreement and moved in troops because of the sympathies of its own 
60 million tamils to the rebel cause but it got bogged down in

angolan guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi who canceled a ceasefire in angolas civil war last week 
softened his stance after talks sunday with south african leader 
fw de klerk 
savimbi said his rebel national union for the total independence 
of angola still is committed to peace in angola and promised he will 
attend an african summit to put the fractured peace process back on 
track in zaire next month 
on thursday savimbi said a 2monthold ceasefire has failed and 
ordered his fighters to resume their 14year war against angolas 
marxist government 
but after meeting de klerk savimbi said in a statement 
we welcome the prospect of resuming talks with the angolan 
government at the earliest possible opportunity we commit 
ourselves again to the effort to achieve peace and national 
reconciliation 
the statement did not say the guerrillas will observe the 
ceasefire 
angolas government and the guerrillas repeatedly have accused 
each other of violating the ceasefire and reported heavy fighting 
recently 
savimbi said the truce and subsequent peace negotiations are 
failing because some african leaders misinterpreted a june 22 
ceasefire agreement reached in zaire 
zambian president kenneth kaunda present at the zaire talks and 
a related summit in zimbabwe last week said savimbi agreed to go 
into temporary exile and that his troops would be integrated into 
angolas existing oneparty structure 
savimbi says he never agreed to leave but he would consider 
temporary retirement inside the country if he could later contest 
open elections 
the rebels have been at war for a share in government since 
portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the country in 1975 
leaving rival groups to fight it out for power the popular movement 
for the liberation of angola now led by president jose eduardo dos 
santos won 
the statement issued by president kaunda about the content 
of the agreements reached in zaire is misleading and 
destructive to the prospect of peace and democratic 
selfdetermination in angola savimbi said 
the agreements set general guidelines for ending the angolan war 
but made no mention of savimbis future role 
savimbi said there were no secret accords and that kaunda a 
strong supporter of the angolan government is attempting to 
redefine history 
kaunda has succeeded in doing no more than embarrassing his 
friends and risking the fragile peace savimbi said 
de klerk is to meet kaunda in zambia on monday to discuss angola 
and other regional issues on friday de klerk met in zaire with 
president mobutu sese seko and the two agreed to mediate between the 
warring angolans 
south africa supported savimbi until a regional peace treaty in 
december with angola which also calls for a phased withdrawal of 
cubas 50000 soldiers from angola 
washington supplies the guerrillas with about 15 million in 
annual aid

five years after he won election to congress 
former us rep pat swindall goes before a judge monday for 
sentencing on his felony perjury conviction and most likely will be 
sent to prison 
swindall 38 a twoterm republican from atlantas eastern 
suburbs was convicted june 20 on nine counts of perjury for lying 
to a federal grand jury about his 1987 dealings with an undercover 
agent posing as a drugmoney launderer 
he will be sentenced monday by us district judge richard c 
freeman who presided over swindalls trial swindall faces between 
10 months and five years in prison on each count the sentences can 
run concurrently plus fines of up to 250000 on each 
the case falls under federal mandatory sentencing guidelines 
which for his crime do not include probation federal probation 
officials the prosecution and swindalls attorneys have filed 
confidential recommendations with the judge outlining the sentence 
they believe is proper for swindall under the guidelines 
federal probation officials and prosecutors are seeking a prison 
sentence of 37 to 46 months according to published reports 
swindalls attorneys reportedly are suggesting that the sentencing 
guidelines call for 10 to 16 months and they are seeking a lighter 
sentence than that 
swindall last week declined to discuss the case saying he 
preferred to wait until after sentencing to make his comments 
in calling for the stiffer sentence assistant us attorneys 
craig a gillen and thomas bever said in a sentencing memorandum 
that swindalls suffering is of his own doing 
while it is true that as a young multimillionaire congressman 
with a seemingly bright political future the defendants descent 
must have been quite painful for him and his family it is a pain 
created by his own hand the prosecutors wrote 
as the defendant emphasizes his status as a former public 
official one is remembered of the edict to those whom much is 
given much is expected unlike so many others who have come before 
this court for sentencing with limited economic opportunity limited 
intellectual ability and inadequate educational background the 
defendants horizon was unlimited bound only by the strength of his 
character and moral judgment or lack thereof the memo said 
swindalls attorneys used a similar argument in seeking a lighter 
sentence saying he should be spared a long prison term because he 
lost his house seat faces permanent expulsion from the state bar 
and has suffered enough to last a lifetime 
swindall was found guilty of lying to a federal grand jury 
investigating a moneylaundering sting operation evidence in his 
trial showed that swindall repeatedly talked with the undercover 
agent and a political associate while he was seeking 850000 to 
finish his luxurious stone mountain home even after a time when he 
told the grand jury he had walked away from the proposed deal 
swindall ultimately accepted and endorsed a 150000 check before 
backing out of the deal 
the jury found swindall guilty of telling 18 deliberate willful 
lies in his grand jury testimony 
swindall was largely unknown politically before he won the 4th 
congressional district seat in 1984 upsetting veteran democrat 
elliott levitas he was reelected in 1986 but lost the seat in 
1988 to democrat ben jones while under the cloud of his perjury 
indictment 
swindall sought a speedy trial before the 1988 election in hopes 
of getting an acquittal and preserving his career but the trial was 
aborted after swindall campaign mailings maintaining his innocence 
reached members of the jury

one lucky gambler matched six numbers in the 42 
million illinois state lottery lotto drawing and became the largest 
single jackpot winner in the states history officials said sunday 
the winning ticket was purchased somewhere in the chicago 
metropolitan area which includes the city and surrounding counties 
mike wittkowski a chicago printer who was a 1984 lotto winner 
held the previous state record of 40 million the states biggest 
jackpot ever was 699 million for the april 15 drawing this year 
that prize was divided four ways 
nationally the biggest single lottery winner was sheelah ryan of 
winter springs fla who won 5516 million in the florida lottery 
on sept 3 1988 other jackpots have been larger but they were 
split by more than one ticketbuyer 
the winning numbers drawn saturday night were 6 9 33 40 51 
54 in addition to the one person who matched all six 607 people 
matched five of the six numbers for 216450 and 35677 people 
matched four numbers for 7350 said lottery spokeswoman kathy rem 
the winner will receive an annual payment of about 21 million 
for the next 20 years with the exact amount to be determined 
monday she said 
since july 29 when the jackpot was 6 million no one has 
matched all six numbers rolling over the prize money each time to 
the next week 
previous lotto winners have found innovative ways of safeguarding 
their tickets until they can hand them in 
robert rucker who won 2 million in 1984 said he read his 
numbers a dozen times before he started jumping up and down and 
crying 
thats when you suddenly realize you are holding the equivalent 
of a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in cash he said 
and its strictly up to you to protect it for the next 24 to 36 
hours 
he put it in a strongbox in his bedroom and invited friends over 
to have strength in numbers 
lottery director sharon sharp said her favorite story is the 
woman who stuck the ticket in her bra in a plastic bag so she 
wouldnt sweat on it

holocaust survivors opened a public hearing 
sunday to challenge experts findings that nazi criminal dr joseph 
mengele drowned in brazil in 1979 
the threeday hearing before a 10member tribunal at yad vashem 
holocaust memorial focuses on claims mengele has been spotted 
recently in places ranging from an island off the portuguese coast 
to a dental clinic in sao paulo brazil 
the proceedings also follow jewish protests over a roman catholic 
convent located at auschwitz death camp in poland where mengele 
worked and where 25 million of the 6 million jewish victims of the 
nazis died 
mengele known as the angel of death has been accused of 
sending 400000 people to die in gas chambers and of conducting 
cruel medical experiments on twins at the camp this week german 
prosecutors announced they are investigating new evidence suggesting 
similar experiments were carried out on retarded children 
mengele was declared dead in june 1985 by an international team 
of forensic experts who concluded within a reasonable scientific 
certainty that a skeleton exhumed from a cemetery in embu near 
sao paulo was that of mengele israel never accepted the findings 
relatives said mengele drowned near sao paulo on feb 7 1979 
but announced the death only in 1985 during an international 
campaign to bring him to trial 
there are claims that mengele is still alive said aharon 
simcha a retired israeli judge heading the tribunal there is a 
feeling especially among auschwitz survivors and mengeles victims 
that not enough is being done to bring him to trial 
among those to testify is american actress susanne severeid who 
told reporters she saw a person who fit mengeles description on 
puerto santo island near portugal in april 1985 
ms severeid said she traveled to the island with her husband a 
former dutch resistance fighter after the simon wiesenthal nazi war 
crimes research center was told mengele might be there she was to 
testify at the hearing tuesday 
i think the body in brazil was a hoax added ms severeid 
who starred in the television series the paper chase i saw a 
man who fits his profile 
four holocaust survivors also said a brazilian dentist maria 
helena bueno de castro says she treated mengele in sao paulo about 
two months after relatives announced his death she reportedly said 
the man she believed was mengele called himself pedro miller 
before the hearing some auschwitz survivors held an emotional 
burial ceremony for ashes of victims they brought back from a visit 
to the camp last week

hundreds of thousands of people rallied in the 
republic of moldavia on sunday to demand adoption of moldavian as 
the official language organizers said 
in the baltics activists responded to a kremlin attack on their 
drive for independence on saturday the communist party central 
committee criticized the nationalist movements as leading the region 
into an abyss 
national deputies from latvia in a telegram to president mikhail 
s gorbachev said the central committee statement had spread 
disinformation to the population of latvia and the world causing 
obstacles for perestroika and the republic 
we expected this said raimona sakalouskis of sajudis the 
lithuanian movement 
nikolai raiyulanu of the moldavian peoples front said 250000 to 
300000 people jammed victory square in the moldavian town of 
kishinev holding flags and banners boosting ethnic demands 
the soviet evening news showed a crowd overflowing in the square 
which was a sea of red yellow and blue moldavian flags 
the tass news agency said moldavian president mircha i snegur 
addressed the crowd and appealed for calm discussion of a law making 
moldavian the official language which will be considered by the 
republics supreme soviet or parliament on tuesday 
he said the proposal does not infringe on the rights of other 
nationalities living on moldavian territory tass reported 
about 2000 members of a group called unity which is comprised 
mostly of russians ukrainians and other minorities in the republic 
held a rally nearby raiyulanu said in a telephone interview from 
kishinev they passed a resolution calling the proposed law a 
violation of their rights tass said 
tass also said a third rally was held this by thousands of 
gagauzi a christian turkish minority group the gagauzi meeting in 
komrat also were protesting that the language law infringes on 
their right and the rights of other minority groups tass said 
the rallies came amid a wave of strikes at more than 100 
factories and offices in russian and ukrainiandominated cities 
protesting the proposed language law 
strikers have demanded that the moldavian government allow more 
time for discussion of the law its final draft version was 
published in the official press on aug 20 
the law would make moldavian a dialect of the language spoken in 
neighboring romania the official language it would also restore 
the latin alphabet that the soviet dictator josef stalin replaced 
with cyrillic when the soviet union forcibly took the land from 
romania in 1940 
leaders of the peoples front see the adoption of the language 
law as vital to protecting moldavian culture they are one of many 
soviet ethnic groups who have been agitating for more autonomy from 
the kremlin 
the moldavian activists view the language law as a first step in 
a program modeled on the baltic republics more radical program of 
political and economic autonomy 
more than 1 million residents in those three northwestern 
republics linked hands last week in a giant chain to protest a 
sovietnazi pact of 50 years ago that led to the soviet annexation 
of the three states one baltic republic estonia has declared 
partial sovereignty from moscow 
saturdays official message from the communist partys 
policymaking body accused separatist elements of whipping up 
nationalist hysteria and appealed for an end to their push for 
secession 
in its own response the peoples front organization in latvia 
acalled for restraint among latvians lets be united and calm 
and not give in to the provocation it said 
sources said the latvian communist partys central committee 
would hold a special meeting on wednesday to discuss the declaration 
on sunday the national communist party daily pravda said the 
need for a moldavian language law was obvious 
however it said the debate over the law had raised other more 
extreme demands that worried the nonmoldavian speaking minority and 
prompted its protests 
all the more often at rallies of the peoples front you hear 
slogans like moldavia for moldavians the newspaper said 
it said some people in the moldavian republic were even talking 
of seceding from the soviet union

the birthplace of irish playwright george 
bernard shaw is up for sale and his admirers are trying to raise 
money to turn the yellow brick rowhouse into a museum 
members of the shaw birthplace museum trust said sunday they have 
had talks with financial backers whom they would not identify 
about purchasing the eightroom house where shaw was born in 1856 
owners aida and eugene giblin want 222750 when the house at 33 
synge street in south dublin is auctioned next month but that is 
twice what the trust thinks it is worth 
theyre looking for quite an unrealistic figure said trust 
chairman nora lever its in a very bad state of repair 
ms lever said the trust will make an offer for the house but 
if that is not acceptable then weve had it thats it out 
similar properties on the street named after another irish 
dramatist john millington synge are selling for 81000 to 
108000 she said 
with its links to shaw the house has got to be worth double 
the value of other houses in the street mrs giblin said its 
a disgrace that no state agency would come up with the money the 
house should have been declared a national monument years ago 
ms lever also criticized the lack of state funding for the house 
shaw lived in until he was 10 years old 
the playwright who died in 1950 at age 94 left the national 
gallery of ireland onethird of the royalties from his published 
work she noted the unexpected bequest was swelled by the success 
of the 1964 film my fair lady based on shaws pygmalion 
other famous shaw plays include man and supermanmajor 
barbara and joan of arc 
shaw came to london in 1876 where he found fame and fortune as an 
art music and drama critic playwright commentator and social

president bush showed off his old 
first basemans style sunday getting one hit in two atbats and 
collecting four putouts in a softball game organized by journalists 
and local businessmen 
a captain and first baseman on yales baseball team four decades 
ago bush tried to live down his collegiate reputation as a 
goodfield nohit player in the two innings he played sunday on the 
side of a rump team of white house staffers against a pickup squad 
of reporters photographers and local residents 
those who said good field no hit i think its a vicious 
assault not only on my baseball ability but on my character he 
quipped 
bush joined the game in the second inning with the white house 
team behind 70 he flied out to short center in his first atbat 
but hit a ground double down the first base line his second time up 
the white house team rallied behind his play scoring six runs to 
narrow the score to 76 but after bush left to go fishing the 
opposing journalists and businessmen recovered and won the game 96 
softball was one of four sports activities the vacationing 
president devoted his attention to sunday at his seaside home on 
walkers point wedged between them were two church services that he 
attended with his visiting houseguests evangelist billy graham and 
his wife 
originally bush said he was going to have what he called a 
quintathelon day of jogging tennis softball golf and boating 
he canceled the golf saying i have a rendezvous with bluefish 
although he has yet to catch one despite attempts daily since his

voyager 2s closeup photos of neptunes 
moon triton reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that erupt 
explosively spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 miles 
high scientists said sunday 
i believe they are active or erupted at least within the 
past 100 years said us geological survey geologist larry 
soderblom a member of the voyager photographic imaging team at 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory theres 10 or 20 or 30 lots 
this is a crazy idea but its the best we have at the 
current time to explain the pockmarked terrain he added 
while more evidence is needed to prove the volcanoes are active 
the whole process makes physical sense said bradford smith 
leader of the voyager 2 imaging team that is a perfectly sensible 
explanation 
if soderblom and smith are right triton is only the third object 
in the solar system known to have active volcanism earth and 
jupiters moon io are the others 
soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes with 
sulfurspewing volcanoes on io but he said the volcanoes on triton 
are produced when liquid nitrogen rises in underground pools rises 
to the surface where reduced pressure means its got to explode 
and will shower ice particles and gas 
based on darkcolored plumeshaped deposits that stretch up to 
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes soderblom estimated the 
eruptions eject debris at scores of mile per hour perhaps faster 
sending it 12 to 19 miles skyward 
the stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel 
said smith a university of arizona planetary scientist the 
deposits apparently contain radiationdarkened ices that fell to the 
surface after being carried skyward by the blast he added 
voyager 2 made its closest approach to neptune on thursday night 
when it skimmed about 3000 miles over the planets north pole cloud 
tops early friday morning the spacecraft zoomed about 24000 miles 
past triton taking the photos that have revealed at least three 
kinds of icy volcanism on the moon 
voyager earlier discovered icy flows that oozed up from the 
floors of long valleys a process likened to toothpaste coming out 
of a tube slit with a razor blade 
on friday scientists announced that voyager had discovered a 
different type of ice volcanoes which appeared inactive and 
possibly extinct they are huge flat craters called calderas 
similar to the one in which yellowstone national park rests 
some calderas such as the crater atop hawaiis kilauea volcano 
fill with lava lakes tritons calderas measuring up to hundreds of 
miles wide fill with flows of viscous ice possibly water ice that 
gushes up from below smith said 
new evidence released sunday shows tritons icelava lakes can 
come up and overflow you see that happen in hawaii all the time 
when molten rock lava overflows crater walls smith said 
so eruptions from tritons calderas once produced a sea of 
icelike lava in repeated eruptions resulting in massive 
oceanicscale flooding soderblom said during a sunday news 
conference he said at least four such calderas have been spotted on 
triton 
soderblom said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice 
volcanoes either are currently active or erupted within the past 
century because they are located on tritons huge south polar ice 
cap 
a year on neptune and triton lasts about 165 earth years so if 
the ice cap had gone through a summer evidence of volcanic deposits 
would have been erased as the ice cap receded he added 
so far voyager has discovered six moons orbiting neptune in 
addition to triton and nereid which were discovered from earth it 
also has found five rings of debris orbiting the planet including 
two that are broad bands of dust 
the latest ring photo released by nasa sunday shows one of those 
bands is even broader than thought forming a beautiful circular 
sheet of dust that extends throughout the plane of neptunes rings 
and extends inward toward the planet 
nasas latest results from voyagers close encounters with 
neptune and triton found that 
winds up to more than 700 mph have been measured in neptunes 
atmosphere 
a day on neptune lasts 16 hours and three minutes give or take 
four minutes 
neptunes south pole and equator while incredibly cold are 
much hotter than the planets middle latitudes 
the planets magnetic poles are tilted an extreme 50 degrees 
away from from the poles around which the planet rotates a much 
greater tilt than the minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially 
estimated that means neptunes magnetic north pole is closer to its 
equator than to its rotational north pole 
it also means neptune is much more similar to uranus which has a 
magnetic field tilt of 58 degrees earths magnetic poles are tilted 
12 degrees from its true or rotational poles 
by 9 am pdt monday voyager will be 276 billion miles from 
earth and 319 million miles behind neptune speeding away from the 
planet at 37621 mph 
the probe on sunday was looking for lightning and auroras on 
triton it also sent back its best picture of heartshaped moon 
1989n1 which has usurped nereid as neptunes secondlargest moon

crack cocaine a common problem on the east and 
west coasts is beginning to show up more and more in the chicago 
area where until now it has been a rarity police say 
authorities dont know for sure why crack a smokable form of 
cocaine also known as rock cocaine had been so scarce here but 
one theory is that local drug kingpins kept it out of the area 
because they feared it would cut into their profitable trafficking 
in powder cocaine and heroin 
crack is becoming a law enforcement problem in some of the poorer 
southern suburbs and police fear poor city neighborhoods could be 
the next stop for dealers crack dealers have invaded other urban 
centers by establishing footholds first in outlying communities 
police say 
its virgin soil said maywood police lt harold jenkins 
dealers figure they can come here and start their own thing 
los angeles street gangs have introduced crack which has been 
associated with violence in dozens of cities into kansas city mo 
minneapolis and other cities and police are checking reports that 
those gangs also may be involved in chicagos suburbs 
a single dose of crack provides a much more intense high than 
snorting powder cocaine and costs less making it popular in poorer 
communities and among the young 
for years chicago police have focused their drug activities on 
powder cocaine and heroin abuse while other cities reeled under 
soaring homicide rates due to crack chicagos homicide rate dropped 
to its lowest level in 20 years in 1988 
officials say the full extent of crack abuse in chicago has not 
been determined in a fourmonth period ending in june police 
raided 20 crack houses said sgt jim brady 
in suburban harvey 539 drug arrests were made last year and 
police say 95 percent of the narcotics trade there involves crack

the final session of an international conference to 
negotiate peace in cambodia opens monday but lack of progress is to 
keep some key foreign ministers away 
protagonists at the monthlong conference of 19 nations remained 
apart on all major issues delegates said sunday with the role of 
the khmer rouge whose bloody 19751978 rule cost at least one 
million lives at the center of debate 
surprise concessions in the final three days were considered 
unlikely 
in beijing the official xinhua news agency reported that foreign 
minister qian qichen of china a crucial player would attend the 
closing ministerial session only if the four committees of the 
conference can succeed in producing agreements 
china sponsors the khmer rouge the strongest of the three 
resistance movements fighting cambodias vietnamesebacked 
government 
it remained unclear sunday whether soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze would attend the us state department announced 
friday that secretary of state james a baker iii would not come 
because a comprehensive settlement was not in sight 
it was uncertain whether resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk would head his delegation 
in a surprise move sihanouk announced he was resigning as 
president of his movement one of three parties within the 
resistance party sources said sunday but he remained head of the 
resistance and was considering changing his mind the sources said 
on condition of anonymity 
dissension between moderates pressing for a negotiated settlement 
and others opting to continue the guerrilla war against the 
vietnamesebacked government of cambodian prime minister hun sen 
prompted sihanouks move the sources said 
sihanouk named his wife monique and gen nhiek tioulong to 
replace him as copresidents of the movement and designated his son 
prince ranariddh as secretarygeneral 
the conference has sought an overall peace settlement to end two 
decades of violence in cambodia 
however sihanouks coalition and hun sen remain deadlocked on a 
formula for sharing power before general elections 
sihanouk has insisted the khmer rouge be given a role in a 
transitional government to rule after the withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops by late september hun sen says the khmer rouge must be 
eliminated politically and militarily 
there was speculation the conference could lead to further 
negotiations even another conference at a later date and no one 
was prepared to predict failure 
we hope by the end of the year there will possibly be 
something said ek sereywath a spokesman for sihanouks 
delegation he said he could not predict the outcome of the 
conference and was hoping for a surprise

the justice minister resigned because of 
death threats from drug traffickers local reports said sunday and 
one man was killed in the bombing of 10 banks in the 
cocainetrafficking center of medellin 
news reports also said an appeals court has revoked an arrest 
order accusing a top drug lord of ordering two assassinations 
local news media reports said sunday that monica de greiff was 
stepping down as justice minister because of threats against her and 
her family since the government launched an unprecendented crackdown 
on drug trafficking aug 18 several radio and television stations 
carried the reports which also said cabinet changes were expected 
without identifying a source 
a communique issued late sunday by the presidency said barco 
denied reports related to the resignation of the justice 
minister a spokesman at the presidency said he could not amplify 
on the wording of the communique which appears to but does not 
directly deny the reports 
it also quoted barco as saying i havent thought about nor is 
there motive for a crisis within the cabinet its something i 
havent considered not for now or for the future 
mrs de greiff 32 has been justice minister for a month and a 
half a predecessor rodrigo lara bonilla was assassinated by the 
cocaine cartels in 1984 
according to the private national radio network radio caracol 
she told president virgilio barco she wanted to resign before 
leaving the country friday for the united states the network did 
not identify the source of its information 
in washington us attorney general richard thornburgh said that 
if mrs de greiff applied for political asylum in the united states 
she would be welcome 
of course she would be welcome as other refugees from terrorism 
and the kind of violence that affects colombia have always been 
he said on the cbs news program face the nation 
mrs de greiff is in the united states according to an 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity he 
refused to say whether she had resigned efforts to reach her sunday 
through us officials and colombian diplomats in washington were 
unsuccessful 
the bomb blasts occurred between 1 am and 2 am at seven 
branches of the national banco cafetero owned by the state and 
coffee exporters a police spokesman in medellin said in a telephone 
interview he said the bombs did 100000 in damage but caused no 
injuries 
later in the day police said bombs went off at medellin branches 
of the private banco del estado and banco de colombia where a young 
man was killed police said they suspected the victim had placed the 
bomnb 
police said they were uncertain whether the bombings were carried 
out by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas of the national 
liberation army which has attacked the banks offices in the past 
last week the traffickers declared war on the government after 
it began a crackdown in response to the assassinations of a 
magistrate a police colonel and a leading presidential candidate 
during a 48hour period ending aug 18 
we dont have any group in particular that has taken 
responsibility for the explosions the spokesman said police may 
learn more after interrogating the two suspects he said 
medellin 215 miles north of bogota is the base for the worlds 
biggest cocaine trafficking cartel that is believed to be 
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the united 
states 
the traffickers threatened to target the government judges 
journalists and industrialists because of the governments offensive 
the crackdown by the military has confiscated hundreds of 
luxurious homes office buildings and shops believed to belong to 
traffickers in addition to aircraft cars and trucks yachts and 
other goods authorities said the raids will continue but so far 
the cartel bosses have eluded security forces 
mrs de greiff holds a key seat on a special national council 
that must decide on the proposed extradition of alleged traffickers 
caught up in the new crackdown and wanted by the united states 
el tiempo reported sunday that a court has struck down an arrest 
order for medellin cartel boss pablo escobar that accused him of 
ordering the massacre of peasants at two ranches by rightwing death 
squads 
judge maria helena diaz who investigated the killings signed 
the arrest order in 1988 and refused to reverse it was 
assassinated on aug 1 
a threejudge panel upheld her decision in november 
but el tiempo said the panel reversed its ruling aug 15 
deciding there was insufficient evidence against escobar who formed 
a trafficking organization in the mid1970s and has repeatedly 
terrorized the judicial system with assassinations and threats 
according to police 
no such reversal was reported at the time and it was not 
possible to confirm the report with judicial officials sunday 
according to the government the drug cartels are financing the 
training of rightwing paramilitary squads that besides providing 
protection for cocaine barons are blamed for the slayings of 
leftist politicians labor activists vagabonds prostitutes and the 
old and infirm

it covers a space roughly the size of a 
football field and boasts 10 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms but 
locals say dunnellen hall also carries a curse that has brought ruin 
to its previous owners and could be a bad omen for the homes 
current mistress leona helmsley 
the opulent 28room jacobean mansion on the outskirts of 
greenwich has been in the national limelight in recent weeks because 
of the federal tax evasion case against mrs helmsley 
she and her billionaire husband harry helmsley were accused of 
billing 3 million in expenses at the house to their real estate 
empire and hotel chain a federal jury in new york began 
deliberating the fate of mrs helmsley and two former aides this 
weekend harry helmsley was severed from the indictment because of 
mental incompetence 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney james devita says the 
money was spent in a bid to turn the home into a modern taj mahal 
its probably one of the most important houses in greenwich 
says majorie rowe president and coowner of preferred properties in 
greenwich 
this house has some history if the walls could talk said 
rowe who has twice handled its sale 
two previous owners lost the estate to financial setbacks 
another was indicted for forgery and a dodge automotive heiress 
suffered marital problems with a husband who killed a busboy in 
florida and later killed himself 
the threestory brick mansion sits on 26 acres of rolling hills 
in the northern end of this posh new york suburb stone walls iron 
fences and a sophisticated electronic system keep the curious at 
bay but a glimpse is possible through the main gate and up a 
1000foot driveway painted brick red for leonas birthday in 1986 
the curious can also get a feel for the house by watching for a 
late night rerun of the 1968 film a lovely way to die the 
movie starring kirk douglas was filmed at the estate and in 
keeping with the alleged curse at dunnellen it was a flop 
the helmsleys hometown newspaper the greenwich time recently 
obtained a rare look inside the house 
its reporter described in detail the ornate dining room with its 
chandelier tapestry paintings and floortoceiling wainscotting 
the limestonewalled reception hall the grand staircase the 
secondfloor workout room where harry helmsley exercises on a 
treadmill under the eye of his personal instructor and the pictures 
of a smiling leona and harry helmsley that grace nearly every room 
on the first and second floors

from the occupied territories during the 20month uprising against 
israeli rule 
four palestinians were deported to lebanon a fifth physicist 
taysir aruri whose cause has been championed by international human 
rights groups was expelled to france after he appealed to israels 
supreme court saying he could face death in lebanon 
the deportations came as israel bombed a proiranian shiite 
stronghold in southeast lebanon killing one guerrilla and wounding 
five others police reported it was the ninth israeli air raid into

advocates peaceful creation of a palestinian state alongside israel 
army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said on army radio 
sunday that israel would continue to deport palestinians despite 
complaints by foreign governments and human rights groups that the 
action violates international law 
shomron said israel considers deportation an effective deterrent 
against the uprising 
the french foreign ministry issued a statement saying aruri was 
welcome indefinitely in france and referred to his expulsion as a 
measure contrary to the geneva convention protecting civilians in 
time of war 
the united states also has condemned such expulsions as a 
violation of the fourth geneva convention 
none of the five palestinians expelled sunday faced trial or 
formal charges appeals by four of the men were rejected by the 
supreme court thursday and the fifth was turned down a month 
earlier the court never has overturned an army deportation order

palestinian communist party 
the army also said he was involved in planning the uprising and 
a member of the uprisings unified command the announcement of 
the four other deportations said the men participated in leading 
and directing the uprising in the west bank

leader of plo chief yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction the 
others were said to be members of the marxist democratic front for 
the liberation of palestine a leftist plo group 
on arrival in south lebanon lebanese police reported the four 
asked to be taken to bases of the democratic front in western bekaa 
valley

lebanese militiaman were injured in the car bombing and israeli 
officials have vowed to avenge the attack 
hezbollah or the party of god has said it carried out the

delegates to the first assembly of the 
evangelical lutheran church in america on sunday delayed a decision 
on whether to set a deadline for selling off stock in companies 
doing business in south africa 
after some debate the decision was deferred until later in the 
eightday meeting of about 1040 representatives which runs through 
wednesday 
at issue was how rapidly the churchs board of pensions should 
divest from such companies to push south africa to end its system of 
racial separation and domination of 28 million blacks by 5 million 
whites 
after morning worship services in chicagoarea churches around 
this suburb the delegates spent more than three hours discussing 
other aspects of the pension program including medical benefits 
and the south african issue 
there is no way one can prudently divest the portfolio except 
gradually over a long period of time it must be handled with care 
and fiduciary responsibility said board president john kapanke of 
minneapolis 
but the pension members for justice a group on the other side of 
the issue said the church has an ethical responsibility to divest 
quickly 
if we cant be ready to hear the voices of blacks crying for 
justice above the call of profit yield then it doesnt mean 
anything to belong to the body of christ said the rev joseph w 
ellwanger of milwaukee 
the assembly is the first for the 53 millionmember denomination 
since the merger jan 1 1988 of the lutheran church in america 
the american lutheran church and the association of evangelical 
lutheran churches 
late saturday the assembly called for an end to us military 
aid to central america and of all destabilizing military 
involvement by outside nations 
the rev mary ann mollergunderson of madison wis said 
violence has increased in el salvador 
the resolution backed peace efforts by the central american 
governments themselves and urged relief and development aid for the 
region and lifting of the us economic embargo against nicaragua 
the denominations pension board holds 16 billion in 
investments for about 26000 participants mostly clergy 5700 of 
them already retired and on pensions 
kapanke said that since early 1988 the board had reduced 
investments in companies operating in south africa from 152 million 
to 849 million 
we think we are one of the leading denominations in 
divestment he said but we are required by law to manage the 
fund solely in the interest of members with care skill prudence 
and dilegence 
that demands financial caution he said in an interview he said 
divestment carried out without fiduciary considerations could mean 
a loss 
however the justice group argues that for the church the 
notion of prudent investment takes on a deeper theological meaning 
of faithfulness 
the boards fiduciary responsibility requires it to take into 
account not only economic factors but also the gospel of jesus 
christ and the churchs overwhelming opposition to investment in 
south africa the group has said 
a church should be willing to sacrifice and take risks to end 
apartheid said bishop david w olson of minneapolis 
it is possible it could mean a financial sacrifice even if it 
costs it should be done for moral reasons he said 
several denominations including the united church of christ 
the episcopal church the church of the brethren and the quakers 
have decided to sell all stock in companies operating in south 
africa but are not yet totally divested 
the justice group pointed out that the episcopal church and the 
united church of chris have have active nobuy policies for such 
stock and have made more progress in divesting than the lutheran 
denomination 
its pension board has had a passive and partial divestment 
policy the group says and actually has increased indirect 
investments in companies in south africa 
fortyfour of the denominations 65 regional synods have urged 
the board to divest totally from firms doing business in south 
africa some synods set a jan 1 1991 deadline for this to be 
accomplished

more than 1000 jewish holocaust 
survivors sunday called on pope john paul ii to remove a 
controversial carmelite convent from a building at the site of the 
auschwitz concentration camp 
a statement released by the american gatheringfederation of 
jewish holocaust survivors meeting at browns hotel in sullivan 
county said vatican silence on the issue was reminiscent of papal 
inaction during world war ii when more than six million jews died 
in the holocaust 
benjamin meed president of the american gathering said the 
presence of the carmelite nuns at the site angered jews and that 
they had set up symbols of faith holy to them but alien to most of 
those who perished at auschwitz 
the nuns have been the subject of protests by jewish groups for 
about two years catholic leaders signed an accord with jewish 
leaders agreeing to remove the group by feb 22 1989 but the nuns 
are still in the building in oswiecim poland a few feet from the 
fence surrounding the concentration camp 
the statement to the pope read in part you lived in the 
vicinity of auschwitz during the years of the holocaust you know of 
the murders at auschwitz surely you know that the overwhelming 
majority of the victims were jews killed solely because they were 
sons and daughters of the jewish people their memory must be 
honored their identity affirmed 
neither a convent nor a synagogue should be on the grounds of 
auschwitz the holy martyrs of auschwitz should be left 
undisturbed the statement said

federal authorities are investigating whether an 
influential brokerage executive invested millions of dollars in a 
possibly illegal tax shelter according to a published report 
the fbi is trying to determine whether thomas dittmer chairman 
of refco group ltd one of the nations largest futures brokerages 
improperly shielded from the internal revenue service up to 10 
million in income in 1982 and 1983 the chicago tribune reported in 
its sunday editions 
federal agents believe dittmer is one of many commoditiesrelated 
businessmen who made moneylosing investments overseas that enabled 
them to avoid paying us taxes on some of their earnings 
including profits from their own trades at commodity exchanges in 
chicago and other cities the newspaper said citing unidentified 
sources 
the sources said dittmer and others may have subtracted the 
overseas losses from their earnings to lower the portion of their 
total incomes subject to federal taxes 
the actions would be legal if overseas losses stemmed from 
legitimate investments but investigators suspect some of the 
transactions involved phony paperwork to describe investments that 
never occurred the tribune said 
dittmer a lake forest resident whose name often appears on lists 
of americas wealthiest individuals has an unlisted telephone 
number and could not be reached by the associated press for comment 
he denied repeated requests for an interview the tribune said 
sources say dittmers attorney claims the executive did not 
knowingly violate any law and believed the transactions were 
legitimate the newspaper reported 
the inquiry into the alleged use of tax shelters does not appear 
to be connected to a 2year federal probe of the chicago board of 
trade and the chicago mercantile exchange which has resulted in the 
indictments of 46 traders 
terree bowers an assistant us attorney in los angeles who is 
supervising one aspect of the tax shelter probe said futures 
traders and other businessmen may have used losses from overseas 
investments to shave up to 500 million from their taxable incomes

chinese authorities announced sunday a new wave of 
closures of commercial financial and supply companies as part of 
their efforts to restore central economic controls that were relaxed 
in recent years 
an order issued by the communist party central committee and the 
state council chinas cabinet said elimination of companies that 
are redundant not qualified not able to meet the public needs 
in violation of state laws or disciplines poorly managed or 
insolvent will last until march 
the official xinhua news agency announced the decision sunday but 
said it was made aug 17 the first indication that the ruling 
partys powerful central committee met then there was no 
explanation for the delay in announcing the decision 
xinhua gave no estimate of the number of companies that would be 
closed it said others would lose preferential treatment such as 
tax reduction or exemption favors given by some locales to 
encourage new private or semiprivate business 
the government already has said it will cut sharply the number of 
companies authorized to conduct foreign trade on the grounds that 
the proliferation of trade companies in the past few years has 
caused market confusion 
last month the party politburo and state council shut down two 
large stateowned conglomerates including one linked to senior 
leader deng xiaopings son deng pufang and ordered audits of 
others in those cases however the main reason given was alleged 
corruption 
the two bodies also barred children and spouses of top government 
and party leaders from working in commercial companies because of 
frequent conflicts of interest the government said saturday that 
all those affected by the order had quit their jobs 
the new order was much broader and appeared directed at the 
millions of factories and commercial companies that have sprung up 
outside the state plan during a decade of economic reform 
central authorities have been trying since last fall to regain 
control over these companies of which some fall under provincial or 
city governments and others are privately or collectively owned 
these operations have far outstripped the large 
centralgovernment controlled sector in efficiency and profits and 
have siphoned away scarce raw materials and funds 
many local governments so far have defied beijings orders to 
rectify their economies and it was not clear how the government 
intended to enforce the new order xinhua said provincial governors 
would share responsiblity for its implementation
