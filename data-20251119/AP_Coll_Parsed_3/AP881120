two men and two teenage girls whose bodies 
were found saturday morning in a truck with its engine running in 
the woods died of carbon monoxide poisoning an autopsy showed 
its just a sad and very unfortunate accident said district 
attorney john conte 
the four victims were in a fourwheel drive truck that apparently 
was climbing a dirt hill and became stuck said state trooper robert 
c meier 
meier said the exhaust pipe was clogged with mud which could 
have caused the fumes to fill the truck and cause asphyxiation 
speculation is that they tried to get out of the mud and 
decided to wait until morning the right rear tire had blown 
conte said 
he added that he doubted alcohol was involved 
dr john krolikowski completed autopsies at the university of 
massachusetts medical center about 530 pm saturday conte said 
the victims were identified as kimberly mcneill 18 of upton 
darlene whitney 17 of grafton douglas scobie 25 of hopkinton 
and hans rosenberger 24 of mendon 
conte said a hunter discovered the victims bodies about 745

ferdinand and imelda marcos met with the fbi 
again saturday and mrs marcos said the american justice system was 
going to be the death of her husband 
enough is enough mrs marcos said in a statement released 
before the meeting which was closed to reporters the filipino 
people and the marcoses have long been used and abused you surely 
will not stop until you have killed president marcos of the 
philippines 
marcos the 71yearold former president and his wife waved 
through their car windows as they passed with lawyers and an 
entourage of about a dozen people and entered an underground garage 
nearly three hours later they departed the same way refusing to 
answer questions 
the fbi refused to release details although spokesman harlan 
frymire said things went more smoothly than the night before when 
the marcoses cut short their visit because marcos was tired and weak 
he finished the processing and he is just cleaning up washing 
the ink off his hands frymire said he provided fingerprints 
and voice samples she provided handwriting samples everything was 
accomplished without any complications 
the marcoses were to submit fingerprints and voice samples 
according to marcos washington attorney richard hibey they also 
were to sign forms authorizing us investigators to search the 
records of several foreign banks where they are said to have assets 
a federal grand jury in new york last month indicted the marcoses 
on federal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering 103 
million from the philippine treasury and defrauding us banks of 
165 million 
mrs marcos 59 pleaded innocent to the charges and was released 
on 5 million bail provided by tobacco heiress doris duke a close 
friend who owns a home here while in new york mrs marcos provided 
some the the required samples including finger and palm prints 
marcos has not been arraigned his attorneys claim he is too 
frail to make the 10hour trip to new york 
the marcoses supplied handwriting samples during friday nights 
threehour session but stopped because marcos was too tired to 
continue hibey said 
it takes a while to do these things hibey said they were 
very cooperative so was the fbi he just got very tired 
attorneys and fbi agents shielded the marcoses from journalists 
and the couple refused to answer questions as they left the prince 
kuhio federal building friday night marcos sat in a wheelchair and 
was wearing a neck brace while his wife wearing a floorlength red 
gown clutched a handkerchief and walked slowly beside him 
in a statement later mrs marcos expressed her anger 
now i ask president reagan for our basic human right to 
country freedom and justice she said if president reagan 
dared to ask the government of the ussr for the human rights of 
the people of russia why not also for the marcoses who are always 
the united states allies and friends 
we are in the usa against our own free will she said the 
marcoses were kidnapped and deceived to come to america 
marcos fled to hawaii in february 1986 after a civilianmilitary 
revolt catapulted president corazon aquino into office ending his 
20year rule 
he later claimed us officials promised to fly him to his home 
province of the ilocos norte not to the united states

mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and 
16 associates were convicted saturday night in a racketeering 
conspiracy that involved murder extortion and other crimes 
a federal jury deliberated 26 hours over three days before 
returning the verdicts 
the government contended the 17 defendants are members of 
organized crime who conspired to participate in nine murders four 
attempted murders extortions drug dealing loansharking and 
illegal gambling they each face up to 20 years in prison 
i think every one of us was quietly confident said assistant 
us attorney louis pichini we were so terribly proud that the 
system worked and did not buckle under 
he added one of the things that this case did was it broke the 
myth of the mafias invincibility 
robert simone scarfos lawyer hugged each defendant and patted 
them on the back after the verdict 
outside the courtroom simone said the prosecution did more 
than a decent job 
i never question what a jury does win or lose simone said 
us district judge franklin vanantwerpen warned the crowd before 
the verdict was read that he would not tolerate any outcry or 
demonstration and there was none 
a few of the relatives most of them wives and children gasped 
when the first guilty verdict was read concerning scarfo 59 
who headed the list of defendants most of the relatives sat 
stunned a few wiped at their eyes and sobbed 
scarfo already is serving a 14year prison term for conspiring to 
extort 1 million from philadelphia developer willard rouse iii 
in two other cases defense attorneys successfully discredited 
the informants to win acquittals for scarfo in a drug case and in 
the slaying of salvatore testa who authorities said challenged 
scarfos control of the philadelphiasouthern new jersey crime 
family 
this time each defendant was found guilty on the two main 
racketeering counts they faced in addition 
francis iannarella jr and salvatore scafidi were convicted of 
operating an illegal gambling business 
scarfo his nephew philip leonetti salvatore merlino and joseph 
pungitore were convicted of sports bookmaking 
joseph pungitore was convicted of distributing methamphetamine 
scarfo joseph ciancaglini and salvatore merlino was convicted 
of distributing 50 pounds of methamphetamine and 
scarfo and merlino were convicted of distributing 
methamphetamine 
others convicted on the main racketeering counts were lawrence 
yogi merlino charles charlie white iannece salvatore wayne 
grande phillip narducci frank narducci jr eugene gino 
milano ralph staino jr joseph grande nicholas nick the blade 
virgilio and anthony pungitore jr 
at pichinis request vanantwerpen revoked bail for the one 
defendant who had not been linked to violent crimes scarfo and 15 
of the other defendants have been in jail without bail since their 
indictment earlier this year and were confined in the courthouse 
through the deliberations 
vanantwerpen adjourned the court without setting a sentencing 
date 
jurors had begun their third day of deliberations saturday at 9 
am 
defense attorneys had attacked the credibility of the 
governments star witnesses exmobsters thomas tommy del 
delgiorno and nicholas nicky crow caramandi who have testified 
in previous trials against scarfo who is from atlantic city nj 
prosecutors pointed to secretly recorded tapes that they said 
also showed the defendants guilt 
thirtythree days of testimony included only two days by defense 
witnesses none of the defendants testified it took five days for 
opposing lawyers to sum up their arguments and vanantwerpen needed a 
full day to explain applicable laws to jurors before handing them 
the case 
during the trial attention also was drawn to two of scarfos 
sons beginning with what authorities said was the attempted suicide 
of mark scarfo 17 in atlantic city nov 1 
then in the philadelphia hospital where mark was taken nicodemo 
scarfo jr 23 was charged with assaulting a woman in an elevator 
nov 4 after visiting his brother

people saturday after a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed 
in north alabama and one car began leaking sulphuric acid 
officials built a sand levee to try to prevent the acid from 
flowing into a nearby creek said lee helms director of operations 
for the alabama emergency management agency 
some of it leaked into a swampy area that has leaked into a 
creek he said we were able to damn it up pretty well but some 
of it did get into the creek 
he said the creek feeds the mulberry fork river and officials 
wanted to make sure that the acid doesnt contaminate area water 
supplies the river is quite a ways downstream and not enough of 
the acid has leaked into creek to have an impact he said 
the csx train derailed for undetermined reasons about 530 pm 
near garden city about 35 miles north of birmingham

sometime he said early in the morning were going to try to 
upright the derailed cars and theres the potential for some 
problems although nothing severe 
helms said some people experienced some irritation as far as 
their eyes but no one was hospitalized 
after receiving conflicting reports helms said late saturday 
that 28 cars and three engines came off the track but it was a 
30000gallon tanker car that caused the most concern 
right now the situation is under control and it doesnt look 
like any danger as far as the sulphuric acid leak helms said 
we dont see any problems with any of other cars that derailed 
helms said two other cars were carrying flammable materials but 
apparently did not rupture when the train derailed

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india said today that a 
unsupported international conference may be needed to establish a 
broadbased government in afghanistan 
in a joint statement issued at the end of gorbachevs threeday 
state visit to new delhi the two leaders appealed to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to implement a united 
nations resolution stressing the need for a government of national 
reconciliation in afghanistan 
however gandhi said he and gorbachev agreed to continue 
supporting the government headed by president najib 
najib has had little success persuading the afghan moslem 
guerrillas fighting his forces to lay down their arms and join him 
in what he calls the process of national reconciliation 
the united states and pakistan have been the chief backers of the 
moslem guerrillas fighting soviet and afghan government troops 
the soviet union is midway through the process of withdrawing its 
troops from afghanistan but said earlier this month that it was 
temporarily halting the withdrawal because of recent rebel successes 
in the afghan battlefield 
the soviet withdrawal is scheduled to be completed by feb 15 
under the terms of a unsponsored accord signed in geneva last 
april 
the statement signed by gorbachev and gandhi urged perez de 
cuellar to implement without delay the general assemblys nov 3 
resolution that called for an end to outside interference in afghan 
affairs and stressed the need for a broadbased government 
the formation of such a government in afghanistan is a matter 
exclusively for the afghan people to decide the gorbachevgandhi 
statement said a unsupported international conference may be 
needed for this purpose 
it also said india and the soviet union deplored the 
obstructionist policy of certain forces that were violating the 
geneva accord on afghanistan 
the joint statement did not name these forces but on saturday 
gorbachev accused the united states and pakistan of creating 
obstacles in the implementation of the geneva accord 
their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to 
rescind those accords even though the grave consequences of that 
are obvious gorbachev said saturday 
before gorbachev left to return to moscow the soviet leader and 
gandhi signed an agreement for the soviet union to build two nuclear 
reactors for a power plant in the south indian state of tamil nadu 
the reactors each capable of generating 1000 megawatts of 
energy will give india its largest nuclear power plant an indian 
government official said 
the project is scheduled for completion in 10 years

a new program to bring arts to homeless people 
will help them build selfesteem and allow them to express what its 
like to be forced to tolerate the intolerable sponsors say 
art is a socially acceptable means of communicating very strong 
feelings said nancy kirk associate director of omahas 
metropolitan arts council 
people who live in shelters need to be able to express very 
powerful emotions in a way other than screaming 
the council has teamed with a coalition of local groups for the 
homeless to provide workshops at seven homeless shelters in omaha 
and one in nearby council bluffs iowa 
the experiment includes performances as well as opportunities for 
homeless people to paint sculpt write and act eventually the 
council hopes to organize an exhibit of works by homeless people and 
will also use the artworks to brighten the shelters 
omahas homeless population is estimated to vary between 400 and 
about 1000 city officials said 
when someone first mentioned the idea of arts for the homeless 
members of the council laughed organizers recalled 
we thought what would we do have portoarts kits or 
strolling minstrels along the river banks said eleanor jones 
the councils program coordinator 
all of us were very naive we thought the homeless were bums on 
river banks she said 
susan ogborn chairwoman of the coalition for the homeless said 
shelter residents have responded enthusiastically to the program 
which held its first performance last month 
we started brainstorming last spring about what it is that 
makes for a whole and healthy person ms ogborn said of 
course we thought of food and shelter and job training but we also 
thought of building selfesteem a lot of that comes back to the 
arts 
the rev bob timberlake director of omahas open door mission 
said the first performance at his shelter involving a pair of folk 
singers was a great success 
it helps them see beyond the tragedy the homeless are so 
filled with despair and emptiness this helps to fill the vacuum 
he said 
it was a real treat said bruce smith 27 a resident of the 
mission 
james bryant 23 a louisiana man who came to omaha looking for 
carpentry work said the show he saw at the day house was 
something different for the kind of situation we are in 
most of the people here are kind of running short on money and 
dont have anyplace they could go to see something like that he 
said 
critics of the homeless arts program feared it would be a 
highsociety wineandcheese party thrown on behalf of the 
disadvantaged sponsors said 
when it first came out in the media it sounded like we were 
trying to raise 50000 or 60000 to put on some extravagant arts 
project so there was an understandable backlash ms ogborn said 
instead of government funds the program is being run on 4000 
raised so far in private donations 
some contributors jones said question the need for arts 
programs for people who dont even have food and shelter but she 
has a ready response 
i do feel that everybody has a right to a fulllife experience 
even if it is just for one day she said 
artists have a special ability to relate to the plight of the 
homeless jones said 
when you put something down on canvas or sculpt something it 
is you it is your life and soul you often are liable to great 
criticism she said 
artists are not in the mainstream of society they sort of 
understand what it is like not to be a mainstream person

frustrated democrats are considering asking 
congress to help change the campaign calendar for the 1992 
presidential election possibly using a lottery to select early 
primary states and diminish the pitfalls of iowa and new hampshire 
among the state party leaders who met here this weekend there 
was little sentiment for a wholesale rewrite of delegate selection 
rules as the solution to the democrats dismal showing in recent 
presidential elections 
im going to tell you everybodys damn tired of rules 
changes said bob slagle the texas state party chairman and i 
think the average democrat thinks were absolutely insane if we get 
into another big battle about rules 
said slagle they want us to worry about how were going to win 
elections 
the one change that has widespread support among party officials 
would be to alter the campaign calendar the principal target would 
be iowa which traditionally has begun the delegate selection 
process 
to many democrats the iowa caucuses are an exercise in 
specialinterest politics that pushes candidates into positions that 
leave them vulnerable to attack in the general election campaign 
having just suffered their fifth defeat in the last six 
presidential elections the democrats are looking for ways to limit 
their vulnerabilities 
iowa and new hampshire each have state laws that automatically 
move their caucuses and primary ahead of any other similar events 
until now there has been no serious attempt to force those two 
small states to observe timetables set for other states which iowa 
and new hampshire have resisted 
the solution now being debated is a federal law dealing with the 
timing of presidential primaries and caucuses 
gaining favor among democrats is the idea of a lottery to 
determine the states that would lead off the process 
democratic national chairman paul g kirk jr while emphasizing 
that he was not endorsing the idea said he thought there was merit 
in studying proposals for holding a lottery one year before the 
nominating conventions to choose two or more small states as sites 
for the first primaries and caucuses 
the candidates dont know what that state is so theyre not 
camping out kirk said it shortens the calendar 
camping out is exactly that candidates now do in iowa the very 
day that kirk was speaking jesse jackson was appearing in iowa at 
the convention of the iowa farm unity coalition 
most iowa democrats expect there will be a debate about the 
iowa caucuses said bonnie campbell that states democratic 
chairwoman they are defensive because they like what we do they 
also recognize there is not unanimity of opinion on that 
in the end it may well be that nothing happens she said 
i think if we survive that will be why 
kirk also said he thought super tuesday the date when most 
southern states hold their primaries together had not produced the 
expected result of boosting a conservative presidential contender 
and probably would be repeated even though it is too large and too 
dispersed 
super tuesdays big winner was jackson and the eventual nominee 
was gov michael dukakis of massachusetts who failed to carry a 
single southern state in the general election 
also talking about a lottery or some other federal move to 
shorten the delegateselection process was former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt a shortlived contender for the democratic nomination this 
year 
babbitt said a lottery would prevent candidates from knowing 
where the campaign would begin and would force them to address 
national rather than parochial issues 
he blamed the democrats string of presidential election defeats 
on a lack of understanding of what voters want from a president and 
candidates who campaign as if they were running for congress 
babbitt said voters want presidential candidates who offer a 
clear vision of where they would take the economy and how they would 
handle defense and foreign policy concerns

malcolm kilduff clearly remembers the 
horror and tears on reporters faces when he told them that 
president kennedy was dead 
the assistant white house press secretary was on his first trip 
as kennedys acting spokesman 25 years ago tuesday when he was 
forced to make the statement confirming the nations worst fears 
president john f kennedy died at approximately 1 pm central 
standard time today here in dallas the nervous young spokesman 
said as newsservice reporters dashed for telephones 
he died of a gunshot wound in the brain 
now 60 kilduff recalled the events of that day from his office 
here where he is editor of the weekly beattyville enterprise 
i was half crying with tears in my eyes because i found it 
difficult to say kilduff said 
but the reporters who assembled for that briefing at 131 pm on 
nov 22 1963 were not the first to get confirmation of the tragedy 
from kilduff 
a short time earlier kilduff said he was seeking permission to 
make the announcement and walked into the heavily guarded room at 
parkland memorial hospital where lyndon b and lady bird johnson 
were kilduff said he wasnt sure how to address the man who was 
sitting before him 
i just gave my best shot and i called him mr president 
kilduff recalled recently and lady bird kind of screamed she 
realized what i was saying 
it was only by chance that kilduff was the ranking white house 
spokesman during kennedys tour through texas kennedys main 
spokesman press secretary pierre salinger was with a group of 
cabinet members on an airplane bound from hawaii to japan 
kilduff can recall each second as he and a group of journalists 
heard shots ring out from the sixth floor of the texas school book 
depository building in downtown dallas at 1230 pm they were in a 
press pool vehicle five cars behind kennedy 
someone in the car said what was that kilduff recalled 
i thought this is the week before thanksgiving and they sold 
firecrackers i said it sounded to me like a firecracker 
another shot was fired and they realized that it wasnt 
firecrackers reporters fought to use the single radiotelephone in 
the car but until the motorcade arrived at the hospital no one in 
the press car seemed to seriously think kennedy had been hit much 
less killed kilduff said 
after catching little more than a glimpse of kennedy and the 
blood in the car outside the hospitals emergency entrance kilduff 
concluded that the wounds might be serious enough that the president 
would be hospitalized for some time he asked an aide to arrange for 
a press briefing room 
and it still didnt occur to me that he could be dead 
kilduff said it just never occurred to me i figured that he was 
wounded 
but moments later a doctor told kilduff the president was dead 
and kilduff went in to speak to johnson fearing a widespread plot 
against all topranking government officials johnson quickly left 
the hospital 
under orders from the new president kilduff withheld the 
announcement that kennedy was dead until johnson made the short 
journey to the airport and was being guarded aboard air force one 
kilduff stayed at the white house press office until 1965 he 
held several mediarelated jobs before becoming editor of the 
beattyville enterprise five years ago beattyville a small 
community in appalachian eastern kentucky is the hometown of his 
wife rosemary 
these days the biggest announcements that kilduff handles are 
the results each fall of the lee county woolly worm survey the 
results have received national attention in recent years as a folk 
forecast for the coming winter weather 
its unreal to me that 25 years have gone by kilduff said 
you wonder whether you said the right things you wonder whether 
you said enough you worry about that

suppose just suppose that after his election 
as president two weeks ago george bush dies before the electoral 
college meets in december who would become president 
or suppose that the electoral college has met but bush dies 
resigns or is disqualified before congress counts the electoral 
votes on jan 6 or after the votes are counted some dire fate 
befalls the presidentelect before the inauguration on jan 20 
who would become president dan quayle dont be too sure 
the first question is a trick question no person was elected on 
nov 8 not even bush no matter how the ballot was phrased votes 
were cast for the electors who will choose the president and the 
vice president when they meet in their individual states on the 
first monday after the second wednesday in december 
this year thats dec 19 by custom and honor but not because 
of any constitutional requirement the electors usually vote for 
their partys nominee but not always in 1976 a gerald ford 
elector in washington state bolted to ronald reagan and in 1968 a 
richard nixon elector chose george wallace 
until the electors meet there is no presidentelect says 
thomas h neale an analyst in american government for the 
nonpartisan congressional research service 
under democratic and republican party rules if their 
presidential or vice presidential candidate dies or resigns between 
the nominating conventions and the electors meetings their 
national committees fill the vacancy 
in 1912 vice president james s sherman died on oct 30 days 
before the election in which he sought a second term meeting after 
the election the republican national committee chose nicholas m 
butler to receive the republican electoral votes for vice president 
no matter the republicans lost that year to woodrow wilson 
it is not clear what would happen if the winning candidate dies 
resigns or is disqualified between the time electoral votes are cast 
on dec 19 and the votes are counted in congress on jan 6 
there is a school of thought that there really is still no 
presidentelect or vice presidentelect until the votes are counted 
in congress says neale who is coauthor of a report for congress 
on presidential elections 
some authorities maintain that there is technically neither a 
presidentelect nor a vice presidentelect until after the votes are 
counted by congress on jan 6 the report says the reasoning is 
that no living candidate would have received the required majority 
of electoral votes 
but says the report others suggest that in case of the death 
or resignation of the winning candidate the jan 6 congressional 
session would declare the vote as cast by the electors 
if quayle should die or resign prior to the congressional count 
the office would either be declared vacant to be filled by the 
president after his inauguration or the senate would elect a vice 
president from among other candidates who received electors votes 
presumably lloyd bentsen would fill the office 
there is no question what would happen if bush should die after 
congress has counted the electoral vote but before the jan 20 
inauguration quayle would become presidentelect and upon taking 
the oath he could then nominate someone to fill the vice 
presidential vacancy 
if bush and quayle both should die between vote count and 
inauguration the presidential succession law would be applied the 
house speaker would become president and if his office were vacant 
then the president pro tem of the senate and on down the cabinet by 
seniority 
assuming none of this becomes necessary the constitution orders 
the electors to send their sealed votes to the president of the 
senate who shall in the presence of the senate and house of 
representatives open all the certificates and the votes shall be 
counted 
the president of the senate and the vice president of the united 
states are the same person 
so if nothing goes wrong a sitting vice president will be 
elected president on jan 6 for the first time in 152 years and 
george bush will have the pleasure of declaring himself the winner

stacked on institutional green metal shelves in 
a dreary offlimits nook of the national archives is virtually 
every shred of evidence of the crime of the century the 
assassination of john f kennedy 
behind a vault door are hundreds of gray cardboard boxes filled 
with materials used in two government investigations from tedious 
bureaucratic documents to chilling reminders of that dark day in 
dallas 25 years ago tuesday 
there is the 65mm mannlichercarcano boltaction rifle that lee 
harvey oswald bought for 20 through a mail order house it is still 
tagged with a commission exhibit label from the warren 
commissions investigation a quartercentury ago 
there are the three shell casings that oswald left at his 
sixthfloor perch in the texas school book depository overlooking 
dealey plaza 
theres the bullet an incredibly unblemished copper slug which 
the warren commission said killed the president and wounded 
thengov john connally of texas as they rode in the motorcade 
conspiracy theorists say the bullet found on a stretcher at 
parkland memorial hospital could not have pierced both kennedy and 
connally and remained virtually intact 
theres a piece of dallas in the collection a onefoot chunk of 
concrete street curb removed from dealey plaza because of an early 
suspicion that it contained bullet fragments the curb was found to 
contain fragments of lead but not the copper of the kind of bullets 
used by oswald 
scattered among reams of fbi and secret service reports are 
fragments of the lonely life of oswald a marxist who lived in 
obscurity and died in infamy and who the warren commission concluded 
was acting alone when he killed kennedy 
there are his academic records from the first grade fbi 
interviews with junior high school classmates letters to his mother 
and his smudged handwritten diary 
the warren commission appointed by president johnson shortly 
after the assassination transferred its estimated 360 cubic feet of 
records to the national archives in late 1964 
more than 95 percent of those records along with physical 
evidence collected by the fbi and other government investigators is 
available to researchers 
the house select committee on assassinations also has its 
records another 300 cubic feet of materials housed in the same 
room most of the house panels records have been sealed for 50 
years and a small band of kennedy researchers have failed in their 
tireless efforts to persuade congress to open them for public 
scrutiny 
in the 1960s and early 1970s the national archives was seen as a 
gold mine of clues for authors and selfstyled sleuths who were 
convinced they could unravel the mysteries of the kennedy 
assassination and prove that oswald was part of a conspiracy 
interest in the materials was renewed in 1978 when the house 
committee concluded that kennedy probably was killed as the result 
of a conspiracy the panels finding that there was more than one 
gunman has sparked as much controversy as the warren commissions 
lone gunman conclusion 
there is little activity involving the records these days 
according to marion johnson a government archivist for 40 years and 
chief overseer of the kennedy records he said no authors or 
scholars are conducting regular research on the assassination at the 
national archives 
some of the kennedy assassination materials are offlimits 
the slain presidents clothing including his monogrammed 
pinstripe shirt soaked with blood are available only with special 
permission from the kennedy family 
the same is true of the 52 blackandwhite and color photos of 
the autopsy a set of the graphic photos made clandestinely at the 
time of the autopsy by a secret service agent who was one of the few 
people who had access to them have appeared recently in a reprint 
of a conspiracy theory book and on a segment of public televisions 
nova series that was devoted to the assassination 
also available at the archives is the zapruder film grainy home 
movie taken by a dallas dress manufacturer abraham zapruder that has 
provided the best though far from perfect video evidence of the 
slaying 
but the film can be reproduced only with the permission of the 
zapruder family and zapruders son a washington lawyer is selling 
rights to the film clip to tv producers for up to 30000 he was 
sued last month by researchers who claim the historic film is part 
of the public domain

the senate budget committees ranking 
republican said sunday that presidentelect george bush is getting 
the bums rush over the economy and should resist pressure to 
fight the federal budget deficit before he takes office in january 
if we start working on this deficit before hes even sworn in 
the highest risk is that were going to get new taxes said 
sen pete domenici rnm 
the hysteric markets and those who insist on new taxes are 
trying to give him bush the bums rush and panic him into starting 
formal kinds of meetings i dont think he ought to do that 
domenici said on nbctvs meet the press 
rep william gray dpa chairman of the house budget committee 
said on the same program that bush needs to take several steps 
quickly including convening a meeting of his administrations 
prospective economic advisers and members of congress 
on saturday sen jim sasser dtenn said in the weekly 
democratic radio address that bush himself should meet with members 
of congress before his jan 20 inauguration to search for a common 
ground in efforts to reduce the deficit 
i totally disagree this presidentelect has to do anything 
before hes sworn in domenici said sunday in fact i dont 
think he has to do anything very quickly 
the senator said he believes bush will keep his campaign promise 
to reject any tax increases and said he should choose appointees to 
the bipartisan national economic commission who strongly agree with 
that position bush is to fill two seats on the commission created 
after last years stock market crash to recommend ways to lower the 
deficit 
gray praised bush for expressing his determination to deal with 
the deficit but said he should go further by appointing other 
members of his economic team fill vacant seats on the deficit 
commission subject his own budget proposals to congress and have 
his economic advisers meet with congressional leaders 
gray said democrats would prefer to reduce the deficit without 
raising taxes but the figures dont add up to enough money for 
defense social security interest on the national debt education 
the war on drugs and all the other programs bush supported during 
the presidential campaign

despite the sirens and fire the drama and the 
damage the takeover of atlantas dank crowded federal prison by 
cuban inmates a year ago caused only a hiccup in a fiveyear plan to 
modernize it 
most buildings destroyed or damaged by the 11day riot already 
were scheduled for demolition and replacement 
an exception was 13 million in damage to the prison industries 
complex where inmates made furniture brooms and mattresses which 
had not been scheduled for replacement it smoldered for days parts 
were saved parts will be rebuilt 
the destruction didnt save us any money but i dont think it 
really cost us much either said associate warden garland jeffers 
he said the riot caused a delay of about three weeks in the 63 
million project work resumed soon after the last of the cuban 
detainees were shipped to other prisons 
one inmate was killed in the riot which prison officials now 
call the november activities 
of the 145 prison guards and other employees taken hostage in 
atlanta and oakdale la 10 still receive workers compensation for 
related psychological problems a few have left the bureau of 
prisons but 123 are back at work in the federal prison system many 
in atlanta 
half of the 14 buildings at oakdale were destroyed and that 
facility opened in 1986 as a shortterm holding center for illegal 
aliens remains closed 
the riot and takeover by the 1100 inmates started nov 23 three 
days after the united states announced cuba would take back many of 
the prisoners and two days after a similar takeover at oakdale 
the cubans had arrived in 1980 on the freedom flotilla 
boatlift and either had criminal records in cuba or ran afoul of the 
law in the united states 
about 750 regular prisoners are back in the big a as the 
prison has been known since shortly after it opened in 1902 the 
cuban detainees have been paroled or are held elsewhere 
the penitentiary was last modified around 1918 and was one of the 
blacker holes in the federal prison system for decades it is the 
oldest and one of the larger federal prisons 
outside contractors within the 27acre prison are building 
recreational and vocational facilities and new cell blocks that will 
provide more open space but incorporate smaller units lessening the 
chance of another takeover 
the idea is to do away with the claustrophobic feeling to have 
more open areas said angie sheffer executive assistant to warden 
joseph petrovsky 
she said the prison population is smaller than it has been in 
years and is made up of lowersecurity prisoners primarily 
whitecollar criminals and drug dealers not considered violent 
despite the classrooms new chapel recreation and television 
rooms library and other amenities being built the big a is still a 
prison 
rolls of barbed wire drip from the tops of high steel fences 
tower guards watch every move and there is always the wall 
finished in 1910 
a prison fact sheet says the 4178foot wall as much as 37 feet 
high was the largest single concrete structure in the world until 
hoover dam was built on the colorado river in the 1930s

one year after mayor harold washingtons death 
there is pessimism in the black community that worshiped him and the 
strong prospect of another daley occupying city hall come next 
spring 
when washington was stricken by a heart attack nov 25 two days 
before his 66th birthday it marked the second time in 11 years that 
a powerful chicago mayor died in office without warning 
and like the politician he came most to resemble boss 
richard j daley who died in 1976 washington died without 
annointing a successor 
both were so jealous of power said alderman larry bloom a 
staunch washington ally and one of a handful of announced candidates 
for mayor they made sure that nobody but nobody was on their 
heels 
on monday the illinois supreme court is scheduled to decide 
whether to order a special election next year or allow acting mayor 
eugene sawyer to finish washingtons second term and face 
reelection in 1991 
if a lowercourt ruling stands 1989 will be the time and an 
already crowded field is expected to swell as both sawyer and cook 
county states attorney richard m daley formally announce their 
candidacies 
the two are favored to meet in the democratic primary feb 28 
although political observers say the 54yearold sawyer has the 
tougher road to travel in this strongly democratic town where no 
republican has been mayor for more than a halfcentury the primary 
is considered decisive 
if he wants to avoid a possibly fatal split in the black primary 
vote sawyer will have to persuade alderman tim evans who leads him 
in the polls to drop out before the primary daley the 46yearold 
son of the late mayor is expected to have an easier time persuading 
two of his three white rivals to step aside while bloom the third 
rival is not considered much of a factor 
ironically it was daley who helped put washington in office as 
the citys first black mayor by splitting the white vote with 
thenincumbent mayor jane byrne in the 1983 democratic primary 
washington gained a narrow primary victory against daley and byrne 
before going on to win the general election that year he then 
repeated his win in the spring of 1987 
just as in 1983 the primary could be decided next february by 
how many black or white candidates remain in the field and this 
time the more costly struggle is taking place among the black 
candidates 
by electing harold and then reelecting him we gave ourselves 
the impression we had become more sophisiticated politically said 
lu palmer an influential local radio commentator and political 
activist now we are proving we did not 
according to a recent poll by the chicago suntimes and wlstv 
evans was supported by 45 percent of black voters against 16 
percent for sawyer a third black candidate alderman danny davis 
managed just 8 percent support blacks make up about 40 percent of 
the population 
when daley is factored in the same poll shows the late mayors 
son supported by 37 percent of all voters including 13 percent of 
blacks and 53 percent of whites evans was second at 22 percent and 
sawyer third with just 10 percent 
republicans have yet to name a candidate for the april 4 general 
eelction 
one main reason sawyers black support lags is that the city 
council coalition that elected him acting mayor a year ago was made 
up largely of antiwashington white aldermen 
evans who was washingtons floor leader in the council and 
claims to be his only heir argues that washington would never have 
made such an accommodation with his foes 
they have forgotten that everything we got for ourselves we 
got by fighting for it evans said not because we decided to 
unite with our enemy 
but sawyer has amassed a 2 million campaign chest compared with 
less than 100000 for evans and his campaign strategists are 
betting an advertising blitz will force evans out of the democratic 
primary 
im in the chair and im not a quitter sawyer said im 
not going to walk away 
daley meanwhile has had the luxury of remaining above the fray 
quietly building a war chest of his own he has demurred when asked 
about a mayoral run but several democratic committeemen say he is 
simply waiting for mondays court ruling 
hes told me that hell run the suntimes quoted an 
unidentified daley source as saying and he doesnt care who else 
is in the race

the conservative heritage foundation is 
recommending that presidentelect george bush give his vice 
president dan quayle a key role in white house dealings with 
congress 
the proposal was included in the think tanks 937page mandate 
for leadership iii policy strategies for the 1990s which is 
expected to be published next month 
the foundation urged bush to give new weight to the vice 
presidents constitutional role as presiding officer of the senate 
which traditionally has been a ceremonial post except when the vice 
president is needed to cast tiebreaking votes in the senate 
this will inevitably make him a powerful figure in his own 
right but a strong president should welcome the prospect william 
j gribbin wrote for the foundation 
quayle a 41yearold republican senator from indiana is an 
ardent conservative whose credentials for the vice presidency were 
widely questioned during the presidential campaign this fall bush 
has not yet outlined the assignments he will give his vice president 
the volume is the third in a series of policy books by the 
heritage foundation the first released shortly after the 1980 
election was considered a blueprint for president reagans first 
term 
the chapter of the latest volume on dealings between the white 
house and congress was made available sunday to the associated press 
gribbin a staff member of the senate republican policy 
committee recommended that bush a former house member 
be president of all the people but not try to be a colleague of 
all of congress where he will have real enemies 
refrain from appearing on network television joking and 
backslapping with members of congress who are hostile to his 
policies if a president signals to the public that his adversaries 
are regular guys it wont matter who wins 
hire as director of the white house legislative affairs office 
someone with sufficient personal prestige who cannot be intimidated 
by other advisers appoint a deputy director who is respected as 
both policy analyst and legislative lobbyist 
quickly solidify his political base in congress and consolidate 
enough support to sustain his legislative vetoes issue veto threats 
only in the name of the president and not his aides 
give a short businesslike state of the union speech and let 
the public know that the president will not conduct politics as 
ususal 
fire anybody who refuses to abide by administration policies 
socialize with members of congress not just a key figure or 
two to strengthen his clout on capitol hil

a pale and seriously ill former paratrooper left 
the soviet union on sunday for the united states where he hopes a 
network of support set up by his uncle in moscow might save his life 
alexander muchnik 20 of klaipeda in the baltic republic of 
lithuania is suffering from leukemia and his 15yearold sister 
viktoria is the only source of the bone marrow needed for a 
transplant that couldnt be performed in the soviet union 
before boarding a plane for new york on sunday the siblings 
their mother and stepfather said goodbye to friends and relatives 
among them was alexanders uncle ilya a 50yearold moscow 
computer scientist who built a network of medical help stretching 
from moscow and amsterdam to the united states 
muchnik whose pale complexion and sparse moustache give him the 
appearance of a young student rather than a veteran of the soviet 
armys paratroop force said simply well see when asked about 
his prognosis 
in the soviet union doctors could only promise him a death 
without pain 
in the united states the family planned to be united with 
alexanders grandmother who emigrated years ago and now lives in 
brighton mass and two aunts who live nearby on tuesday muchnik 
has his first appointment with a boston doctor 
ilya muchnik said so far they have raised only a few thousand 
dollars to cover a complicated operation that will cost about 
100000 
the question about financing the operation remains open he 
said i think i have about three weeks but three weeks thats 
the limit 
he said dr dean buckner a seattle specialist who examined 
alexander on a trip to moscow and has followed the case since 
estimated the operation had an 80 percent chance of success if 
performed in the very near future but he said the chance of success 
will fall sharply after that 
in early october doctors in lithuania spotted a deformation of 
cells that signaled a severe worsening of muchniks condition his 
uncle said 
when muchnik fell ill in july shortly after being released from 
the army his uncle prevailed upon two wellknown soviets 
sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya and economist abel aganbegyan to 
help him find a place for his nephew in a top moscow hospital 
doctors in the netherlands analyzed blood samples and determined 
that his sister could donate bone marrow 
a longtime friend of ilya muchnik computer science professor 
semyon meerkov of ann arbor mich found american doctors who took 
an interest in the case and started a bank fund in the michigan city 
friends from canada the united states west germany hungary and 
poland sent medicine that is not produced in the soviet union 
us embassy officials in moscow processed the necessary visas 
which the family received nov 14 the young man and his family are 
traveling to the united states as immigrants a decision spurred by 
the illness 
muchniks uncle said the family was held back at first because 
alexander and viktorias natural father would not sign waivers 
allowing them to leave the soviet union but he consented when told 
of his sons illness

mike mansfield who got his first look at asia 
from a troopship as a teenage serviceman 66 years later is winding 
down a formidable career of public service and strong influence on 
usasian relations 
mansfield told a tokyo news conference last week he will retire 
before the end of the year after a record ll years as us 
ambassador to japan the country he often describes as the most 
important of all in americas future 
now 85 the former teenage runaway seaman marine miner 
college professor us representative senator and ambassador said 
his decision to retire was made jointly with his wife maureen hayes 
mansfield 
by mentioning her mansfield was sharing credit for his story of 
ragstofame and influence in america 
as a grade school dropout back from service abroad in the navy 
and marines mansfield got a job in the deep copper mines of butte 
mont where he once recalled his schoolteacher bride put some 
sense into me told me to go to school and make something of 
yourself and i did 
the future ambassador was born in new york city of irish 
immigrant parents his mother died when he was 3 and his father a 
hotel porter sent him to live with relatives in the rugged western 
state which he represented in the senate 
i never thought i could get a college education because i left 
school ran away before i finished the eighth grade and joined 
the navy at the age of 14 in the first world war by lying about 
his age mansfield once told an interviewer 
still working in the mines he enrolled at montana school of 
mines and in 1933 at the age of 30 graduated from the university of 
montana there he became an instructor and later professor of asian 
and latin american history decades later as ambassador he liked 
to tell japanese he was once a professor montana us main library 
is now the maureen and mike mansfield center 
miners teachers and montana trade unions provided the democratic 
party political base that sent mansfield to congress for 34 years 
the last 16 as senate democratic leader as a freshman congressman 
in 1944 he was included in a presidential mission to china at the 
end of the war he was among lawmakers advising retention of the 
emperor in japan 
retiring from congress in 1976 mansfield returned from a 
monthlong visit to china urging america to accept the reality of 
communist rule mansfield argued that beijing factions pushing 
revival of the sovietchinese alliance would grow stronger unless 
the united states normalized relations with the mainland even at a 
cost of breaking official ties with taiwan 
two years later the united states took those steps 
mansfield earned a reputation in the senate as a master of gentle 
persuasion and compromise while criticizing us participation in 
the vietnam war and scolding secretary of state henry kissinger in a 
softspoken style that became mansfields trademark he is 
remembered for informal saturday morning gatherings open to any 
reporters who cared to drop into his office in the capitol 
after president jimmy carter named him ambassador to japan sen 
robert byrd mansfields successor as senate majority leader joked 
that mansfield in tokyo would turn the tables and give our friends 
in the east the opportunity to study an inscrutable american 
concerned by growing trade friction mansfield soon after 
arrival made the oftrepeated statement that the usjapanese 
bilateral relationship is the most important in the world bar 
none and that the collision course of the 1930s must be avoided 
at all costs the usjapan security alliance prompted him to liken 
japan and america to copper miners working underground in pairs 
each responsible for his partners life 
mansfield tried to explain japanese sensitivities and 
complexities to american visitors and to urge us business to 
compete more aggressively and seek longterm rather than instant 
profits in japan 
this promoted some american critics to say mansfield was too 
conciliatory but defenders said that to the japanese he was always 
plainspoken and made it clear they were certain to trigger us 
protectionism unless they opened markets and dismantled trade 
barriers portraits of congressional leaders adorned mansfields 
tokyo office as a reminder of who wielded much of the power in 
washington 
the us trade deficit with japan ballooned during most years of 
mansfields ambassadorship but newly elected president reagans 1981 
decision to keep the former democratic senator in tokyo was widely 
applauded as an effort to depoliticize the issue 
protectionist pressure came from democrats and reagan apparently 
felt it very useful to keep a democrat in tokyo who was close to 
his policy line and enormously respected in japan said dr martin 
e weinstein director of japan programs at washingtons center for 
strategic and international studies a private nonpartisan research 
organization i think mansfield has done an excellent job and 
clearly hasnt given into japanbashing at times when it was 
fashionable 
in 1977 mansfields first year as ambassador the us worldwide 
trade deficit was 25 billion dollars 6 billion of it with japan 
more than a decade later the last annual figures were 170 billion 
worldwide and 57 billion with japan

tranquilizer dart and ended her bid for freedom at 1015 am ms 
irvine said 
unharmed by the tranquilizer kumang was returned to the 
orangutan sleeping area which is separate from the display

thousands of ethnic albanians marched 
in a blizzard through this provincial capital on sunday in defiance 
of government orders to end a wave of ethnic unrest and street 
demonstrations 
the demonstrations in the southern province of kosovo are the 
biggest there since world war ii 
sundays protests the fourth straight day of unrest since the 
forced resignation of two ethnic albanian leaders started when 
about 500 chanting students braved the snow to march on the 
headquarters of kosovos communist party 
waving yugoslav flags and ethnic albanian emblems the crowd 
swelled to about 4000 within two hours roaming city streets and 
gathering outside a student canteen and party headquarters 
the crowd first ignored an order by security forces to disperse 
but the demonstrators later began leaving the city center and it was 
quiet by 8 pm 
up to 100000 people marched from dawn until midnight saturday to 
protest thursdays resignations of azem vlasi and kacusa jasari 
members of kosovos 13member ruling politburo 
police blocked roads into pristina late saturday to prevent more 
protesters from joining the boisterous crowds that demonstrated 
almost continously since vlasi and jasari resigned 
snow fell through the night driving chanting columns of 
protesters off the streets and increased police patrols appeared on 
the streets sunday 
the provinces acting communist party head remzi koljgeci tried 
to defuse the tension by announcing saturday night that the 
resignations might be reviewed and reversed but he also warned that 
extraordinary measures of security could be introduced if 
demonstrations continued 
in the past three days we went through a situation which we 
could not control he said in a television interview sunday 
morning 
slobodan milosevic the communist party chief of the republic of 
serbia which controls kosovo put what vlasi called terrific 
political pressures on him and jasari to resign as part of his 
campaign for more control over the autonomous province 
kosovo which is dominated by an ethnic albanian population is 
the heartland of serbias medieval empire the slav minority 
composed of 200000 serbs and montenegrins alleges it is being 
harassed by the 90 percent albanian population 
on saturday milosevic was honored by hundreds of thousands of 
serbs at a rally in belgrade the capital of both yugoslavia and 
serbia the belgrade communist party daily politika said the 
demonstration was the largest in yugoslavias postwar history 
milosevics supporters claimed 13 million people attended the 
rally to express solidarity with milosevic and the slavs in kosovo 
the communist party daily vjesnik suggested 600000 people would 
be closer to reality as the number who attended the rally 
in his speech milosevic vowed the serbs would not stop until 
their battle for kosovo is won 
milosevic has antagonized nonserb communist leaders with his 
campaign which they fear may only be the first step toward 
increasing the already powerful role of serbia yugoslavias largest 
republic in federal affairs 
after the belgrade rally milosevic and koljgeci spoke by 
telephone and agreed on undisclosed measures to calm the situation 
in kosovo the official tanjug news agency reported 
the demonstrations in kosovo were the largest there since the 
communists came to power after world war ii 
provincial leaders warned at a meeting saturday night that while 
they hoped to control the situation sunday they feared more unrest 
when workers return to work on monday 
television reports said two or three demonstrators were briefly 
detained saturday for reportedly chanting demands that kosovo become 
a fullfledged republic the country is made up of six republics and 
serbias two provinces of kosovo and vojvodina 
an estimated 500 ethnic albanians are in jail on charges of 
spreading counterrevolution by allegedly demanding independence from 
serbia 
one ethnic albanian student was heard shouting saturday what 
are we waiting for when our people are rotting in jail 
the simmering ethnic strife in kosovo a backward region 
bordering communist albania heated up over the summer when serbs 
staged a series of mass rallies to back milosevics campaign for 
more control over kosovo 
kosovo won broad autonomy under the 1974 constitution milosevic 
wants that changed to restore serbian control over education the 
judiciary and security in the province

food and response since world war ii said carl whiting an 
executive of the hawkeye area boy scout council in eastern iowa he

joined in the project and the organization hoped to collect more 
than 100 million food items

king hussein said sunday the plo has met 
american conditions for a place in arabisraeli peace talks and 
suggested israel and the united states were blocking peace 
hussein made the comments in an interview on cbs televisions 
face the nation the program was screened on staterun 
television in jordan which shares israels longest border 
i believe the plo has gone as far as it was asked to go and has 
contributed its share for progress toward a just and comprehensive 
peace the king said 
israel for years has pinned its peace hopes on a separate deal 
with hussein cutting out the palestine liberation organization but 
hussein insists that the plo take part in any middle east settlement 
the plos policysetting palestine national council last week 
endorsed un security council resolutions 242 and 338 implying 
recognition of israels right to exist 
it also endorsed the cairo declaration which calls for an end to 
21 years of worldwide israeliplo underground warfare and restricts 
guerrilla operations to military targets in israel and the occupied 
territories 
israel officially rejected the councils move saying the 
organization has not explicitly recognized israel nor renounced 
terrorism the united states also had refused to deal with the plo 
until it renounced terrorism 
i believe they have denounced terrorism time and again 
hussein said i believe that if there is any intransigence and 
there is indeed it is in the israeli position which hasnt 
changed and up to now the united states position 
i believe our friends in washington had better go back and look 
at the papers and positions they adopted and they will find there is 
no difference between their initial demands and requests and 
suggestions and what the plo has come through with now 
us officials have reacted cautiously to the plo declarations 
resolution 242 adopted in 1967 called for an israeli withdrawal 
from the territories it captured in that years arabisraeli war 
the west bank and gaza strip 
resolution 338 passed in 1973 called for implementation of the 
earlier resolution and negotiations for a just and durable peace 
in the middle east 
asked why plo chief yasser arafat would not explicitly endorse 
israels right to exist hussein said they have accepted 242 
which speaks of the right of all states in the area to live in peace 
and security beyond that i dont see what could be asked of the 
plo at this date 
hussein said there would be no hope for peace if israels 
hardline likud faction holds to its demands that israel maintain 
all of the territory captured from the arabs in 1967 land the 
arabs hope to trade in return for peace 
the likud bloc has been asked to form a new israeli government 
following nov 1 elections and is trying to forge a coalition 
government 
if likud holds onto the policies that it declared before 
then there is no hope for peace hussein said but on the other 
hand if theyre speaking of 242 in other words territories 
occupied in june of 1967 then that is an entirely different 
situation 
hussein disputed us presidentelect george bushs claim that a 
palestinian state would be a threat to jordan 
i see no threat in any form or way said the monarch who has 
guided the oftenimperiled kingdom since 1953 
husseins prime minister zaid rifai said earlier sunday that 
the biggest challenge facing bush in the middle east is going 
to be how to face israels instransigence and refusal to recognize 
the basic essential ingredients for a peaceful resolution of this 
conflict 
rifai in an interview with the associated press said jordan was 
prepared to grant diplomatic relations to the new palestinian state 
in july jordan renounced sovereignty over the israelioccupied 
west bank

representatives of the united states 
energyproducing states urged opec on sunday to reach a new 
production accord so crude prices can rise and help their states 
ailing economies 
were fighting for our lives je jumonville jr a 
democratic state senator from ventress la told a news conference 
its a major part of our economic survival 
ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
tried in a third day of closeddoor talks to resolve a dispute 
between iraq and iran that has been delaying work on a new 
production agreement 
the accord would limit the amount of oil each of the 13 opec 
countries could produce in an attempt to limit breakneck production 
that has caused a glut and sent prices downward 
oil minister rilwanu lukman of nigeria the cartels president 
said a proposal was on the table but he gave no details 
the discussions are continuing said sheikh ali khalifa 
sabah the kuwaiti oil minister we are here to find a solution 
the negotiations preceded mondays start of the cartels winter 
meeting 
jumonville and other representatives of us energyproducing 
states met with opec members to appeal for price stability 
the 12member delegation represents the southwest energy council 
and the interstate oil compact commission members of the delegation 
are from louisiana arkansas texas oklahoma and alaska 
texas railroad commissioner kent hance told reporters he wanted 
to have a dialogue with people that have more say on the texas 
economy than anything thats decided in our state capital or our 
national capital 
the plunge in prices in 1986 badly damaged the economies of us 
oil states there is concern a recent fall in prices could lead to 
another downturn 
we feel that our economy in texas is starting to turn around 
but if oil prices went to singledigit numbers it would stop us 
from having a turnaround he said 
the officials said if prices rose to 1820 a barrel it would 
help their economies 
it wouldnt be a boom for us but it would allow us to 
survive hance said 
the december contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil settled at 1360 a barrel on friday 
opec maintains a benchmark price of 18 a barrel although arab 
crudes have been running about 10 a barrel 
the recent weakness in prices has been blamed partly opec 
production that has surged to its highest monthly level in five 
years 
the current output accord worked out in 1986 sets total opec 
output at about 15 million barrels a day but total cartel 
production in october was estimated by the international energy 
agency at nearly 211 million barrels 
the accord covers only 12 members because iraq refused the daily 
quota of 15 million it was assigned insisting that it be raised to 
the 24 million given its bitter enemy iran 
since the two countries agreed to an august ceasefire in their 
8yearold war efforts have been made to return iraq to the quota 
system 
formal talks between the two opec committees price evolution 
and longterm strategy began thursday 
cartel members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab 
emirates and venezuela

theres a gnawing problem in chagrin 
falls a family of beavers has moved into the fashionable cleveland 
suburb much to the chagrin of residents 
this is the worst year weve had with them said robert 
mckay village administrator theyve done a number on a lot of 
trees 
the beavers apparently have multiplied in recent years and have 
moved downstream in the chagrin river to popular riverside park 
small trees at the back of the park were the first to go about 
three months ago mckay said then the beavers started moving 
farther into the park biting chunks out of ornamental cherry and 
other trees 
they started chewing all the trees in the park said mayor b 
richard bodwell estimating the cost of the damaged trees at 3000 
or more 
several residents are concerned about more than the trees 
fearing that children or pets in the park could be injured 
officials said but they say that the animals are natuarally timid 
and will flee when approached 
at night when people walk through the park they find 
themselves face to face with bucky beaver bodwell said 
a trapper has been helping village employees catch beavers and 
take them to lakes and rivers out in the country

a woman who married a man she earlier helped 
convict of murder kidnapping and rape has asked the state court of 
appeal to overturn the conviction because of alleged coercion by 
fellow jurors 
steven erickson 34 was convicted in march 1987 of the february 
1984 abduction rape and shooting death of a 26yearold woman 
gwendolyn wix 41 was a juror during ericksons sixmonth murder 
trial 
erickson was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility 
of parole primarily because of ms wixs resistance to the death 
penalty 
in march ms wix filed a sevenpage declaration alleging 
impropriety on the part of her fellow jurors 
she didnt mention her marriage in the affidavit and the attorney 
generals office wrote last month that her marriage to erickson 
tarnished her credibility 
deputy district attorney michael knight who prosecuted erickson 
said he once tried to have ms wix removed as a juror after learning 
that she contacted the defense attorney in the case that effort was 
denied by the judge 
this is stranger than fiction knight said she apparently 
fell in love with the guy during the trial ive seen some jurors 
becomed enamored of the guy but ive never seen where theyve 
actually gone and met the guy and married him 
knight said he planned to investigate how the couple got together 
and determine whether ms wix acted improperly during the trial 
jurors who worked with ms wix said they agreed to a penalty 
other than death at her insistence to avoid deadlocking 111 and 
possibly having the case retried jury foreman harry godley said 
friday 
referring to her marriage godley said im completely 
flabbergasted id like to know how their relationship developed 
ms wix said fellow jurors were biased against erickson verbally 
abused her and pressured her to side with them she said they 
refused to listen to her arguments 
godley denies ms wix was coerced you have no idea the way 
everybody bent over backward to try to reason with her he said 
the attorney generals office said there was no evidence that ms 
wixs fellow jurors acted improperly

historians are hoping to learn more about 
the glory days of great lakes shipping from a wellpreserved wreck 
that sank more than a century ago and was discovered recently in 
lake michigan 
two divers found the 200foot wooden schooner wells burt over the 
summer said kurt anderson a board member of the chicago maritime 
society which wants to help recover artifacts to learn more about 
shipboard life 
the divers have decided to keep the ships location secret for 
now to prevent it from being plundered by artifact hunters anderson 
said 
ship traffic was heavy on the great lakes in the 1800s and many 
of them sank during storms he said 
the wells burt sank in 1883 off evanston a suburb north of 
chicago while heading to chicago with a load of coal he said its 
11 crewmen died the ship may have been coming from buffalo 
the wreck is under nearly 50 feet of water and is resting next to 
a rock ridge that protects it from currents anderson said the 
ships deckhouses and masts were ripped off in a storm that sank the 
vessel 
anderson said he has seen a videotape of the wreck and it is in 
good shape 
the deck is pretty much in place and theres a lot of things 
that are still on board he said hopefully the crews quarters 
are still intact so we can look into shipboard life he said 
wed like to find personal effects of the people who were sailing 
on her 
while shipping on the great lakes in the 19th century was a major 
industry little is known about sailors lives aboard merchant 
ships he said 
we want to put together an exhibit about the ship and its 
times anderson said 
the first step is mapping and charting the wreck to find where 
everything is and then recovering artifacts he said

estonian activists put undue pressure on their 
legislators and resorted to threats to win approval for a challenge 
to the kremlins authority over their baltic republic an estonian 
lawmaker was quoted as saying sunday 
in an interview with the communist party daily vasily koltakov 
an ethnic russian and one of seven deputies to vote against the 
measure wednesday portrayed the unprecedented action as excessive 
and dangerous to ethnic relations 
the estonian supreme soviet or parliament approved an amendment 
to the republics constitution requiring that any new soviet laws be 
approved by local authorities they also passed a declaration of 
sovereignty in all areas except foreign affairs and defense 
koltakov a factory worker told pravda that on the eve of the 
session there was an overt coaching of deputies 
koltakov said the peoples front the estonian organization that 
sponsored the amendment advised him to abstain from voting when 
they learned about my stand 
moreover as one of the women deputies told me unidentified 
persons telephoned her on the eve of the session and uttered threats 
to make her cast an aye vote 
felix undusk a spokesman for the peoples front said the pravda 
interview was read in estonian on the republics official radio on 
sunday 
thats propaganda pressure undusk said in a telephone 
interview from tallinn the estonian capital i cant say there 
was any such strong pressure 
a soviet parliamentary committee ruled saturday that the estonian 
action was at odds with the national constitution on the same day 
president mikhail s gorbachev said during his visit to india that 
what is happening in estonia is perestroika his program of 
social and economic reforms 
in the pravda interview koltakov said the peoples front was 
taking gorbachevs reforms too far 
some members of the organization openly have called for a halt to 
emigration of other ethnic groups into estonia or even repatriation 
to their home areas 
according to the last census 61 percent of estonias 15 million 
people are ethnic estonian and 28 percent are russian 
hundreds of thousands of people of nonindigenous nationalities 
have come to feel like lodgers unwelcome to the hosts koltakov 
said 
but undusk said the peoples front which has gained thousands of 
members and the support of high government and communist party 
officials in estonia will not back down 
there wont be any other decision he said we are standing 
on our own 
the drive for autonomy in estonia has spread to the two other 
baltic republics lithuania and latvia residents of the three 
republics which together have a population of less than 10 million 
are clamoring for greater control over their economic and cultural 
life under the banner of gorbachevs reform effort 
legislators in lithuania on friday proclaimed lithuanian the 
mother tongue of about 80 percent of the republics population the 
official language and restored the flag of the independent republic 
that existed until 1940 
on sunday about 140 leaders of the independent lithuanian 
movement for perestroika proclaimed the moral independence of 
their republic from soviet laws said spokesman alvydas medalinskas 
in a telephone interview from the capital of vilnius 
but lithuanian legislators have been discouraged from taking 
action similar to estonias by the chief of their communist party 
algirdas brazauskas 
the small westwardlooking republics were independent until 
1940 when they were deeded to the soviet union under a secret 
agreement between hitler and soviet leader josef stalin

a 70yearold woman who was partly paralyzed 
after an operation to staple her stomach for weight loss was awarded 
7 million in damages 
a baltimore circuit court jury decided friday that ida sobers 
paralysis which stemmed from a stroke she suffered five weeks after 
the stomach operation was caused by the negligence of dr george 
thomas and church hospital 
c robert loskot an attorney representing thomas and the 
hospital said he planned to file posttrial motions but declined to 
specify what he would seek he contended that the doctor was not 
negligent and did not cause the complications that followed the 
operation 
four days after the june 7 1981 operation ms sobers stomach 
began to leak internally said her attorney robert paul mann 
thomas ordered several tests but did not diagnose the problem until 
the next day an operation was then performed to stop the leakage 
but ms sobers condition deteriorated and she eventually suffered a 
stroke 
she was looking forward to the loss of weight and a new life 
before this all happened said mann

california home to 25 percent of the nations defense contracts

a jewish official who resigned under 
fire after defending a blunt speech about the nazi era said west 
germanys top jewish leader pays too much attention to the problem 
of antisemitism a newspaper said sunday 
in a related incident a city council member resigned after a 
newspaper quoted him as saying they still havent killed enough 
jews 
both incidents surrounded west germanys observance of the 
anniversary of the nov910 1938 kristallnacht the night of nazi 
terror against jews that signaled the coming holocaust 
the aachen nachtrichten newspaper quoted witnesses as saying 
councilor willi vossen vossen made the comment as the wegberg city 
council reviewed plans to mark the anniversary 
vossens wife on sunday said her husband would not comment on the 
newspaper report she denied he made the remark 
he didnt say anything like that at all said mrs vossen in 
a telephone interview she refused to give her first name 
wegberg a city of 25000 people is 30 miles northwest of 
cologne 
the newspaper die welt quoted michael fuerst as saying that 
jewish officials should concentrate more on daytoday problems of 
german jews and place less emphasis on threats from antisemitism 
the chairman of the jewish supervisory council heinz galinski 
places too much emphasis on the problem of antisemitism it quoted 
fuerst as saying 
fuerst was the no2 official in west germanys jewish community 
until he resigned last week under heavy criticism from galinski 
fuerst got into trouble with galinski after defending a nov 10 
speech by thenparliament president philipp jenninger marking the 
kristallnacht anniversary 
in his address jenninger reminded his audience that many germans 
initially embraced hitlers campaigns the speech outraged jews and 
others who maintained his comments were not balanced with strong 
condemnation of the nazi atrocities jenninger resigned the next day 
fuerst had defended the speech saying jenninger had said with 
full clarity what occurred in germany after hitler took power 
die welts report is to appear in monday editions the newspaper 
telexed the report to other news organizations in advance 
the aachen newspaper quoted unidentified council members as 
saying vossen said during a meeting they still havent killed 
enough jews 
mayor fritz jakobs said he did not know vossens exact words but 
council members told him it was something very similar to what 
the newspaper reported 
the mayor speaking by telephone read a statement that was 
approved by the council after vossens resignation 
it said in part i wish to state our deep concern we distance 
ourselves in every way from this unbearable and shameful remark

an opposition leader said sunday that 
president augusto pinochet would lose the backing of the armed 
forces if he tried to overturn a referendum requiring him to call 
open elections 
pinochet the army commander said saturday said that the outcome 
of the oct 5 presidential referendum would become invalid if his 
opponents refused to abide by a constitution drafted in 1980 by his 
military government 
patricio aylwin leader of the centrist christian democratic 
party told reporters in concepcion that pinochets statement 
makes me think this gentleman is not really assuming his 
reponsibility as leader 
referring to pinochets comments about canceling the referendum 
results aylwin said he couldnt do it because im certain that 
the armed forces would not back any thing like that 
aylwin a 69yearold lawyer is considered to be the most 
probable presidential nominee of an opposition coalition the 
christian democrats are chiles largest single political 
organization 
in the referendum chileans rejected a proposal that would have 
kept pinochet in power until 1997 the vote was 39 million against 
and 31 million in favor 
as a result the constitution requires that pinochet call 
elections planned for december 1989 and hand over power to the 
winner in march 1990 
since its victory the opposition has pressed for constitutional 
amendments it says are needed to assure full democratic powers for 
the new government they contend the constitution gives too much 
power to the presidency and to the military 
pinochet has said he will permit no changes on saturday in the 
southern city of coyhaique he said of the opposition i have 
asked them if they accept the constitution but they remain silent 
if they say no the plebescite is null 
the 72yearold army commander seized power in a 1973 coup that 
ousted the elected government of marxist president salvador allende 
aylwin called pinochet a president who has been beaten to whom 
the people have said they no longer want and who finds himself more 
and more alone

city students fleeing gangs and lowquality 
education are improperly attending suburban schools which are using 
educators and offduty police officers to catch the impostors 
authorities said sunday 
efforts to find students posing as suburban residents include 
staking out train stations and following students home 
weve caught 75 kids this year who live outside the district 
and the money it cost us to educate them could translate into three 
more teachers said larry walker assistant principal of oak 
parkriver forest high school 
under state law youngsters who live in one school district may 
attend a public school in another area if they pay tuition student 
impostors thus are costing school districts and taxpayers thousands 
of dollars officials said 
at walkers school in oak park located just west of chicago city 
limits annual tuition for students from other districts is 6944 
walker said 
other suburbs report similar problems 
last year it cost 5049 to educate students and this year 
weve found about 25 students who dont belong here and are not 
paying tuition said raymond surges assistant principal at 
proviso east high school in maywood 
if we catch four students thats one teacher we could hire 
he said its a burden that the board of education and the 
taxpayers dont want to deal with 
when they are caught impostor students are withdrawn from the 
school and ordered to enroll in the district where they live surges 
and walker said 
when we find them we ask them to surrender their school 
identification so they cant get into the building surges said 
students who want to get into a suburban school sometimes find 
someone with the same last name in a telephone book and take the 
address as their own or claim they are living with ailing relatives 
the educators said 
ive heard an awful lot of dying grandmother stories surges 
said 
parents seeking better educations for their children usually are 
behind the problem walker said 
the time we see this the most is when the chicago schools are 
on strike he said most parents are honest but if its a 
choice of no school or lying to get their kids into oak park a lot 
will decide to lie 
illinois law requires that once a student is suspected of 
attending classes illegally officials must allow parents an 
opportunity to prove they and the youngster live in the district 
the burden of proof goes to the parent to prove residence 
walker said we ask to see leases or utility bills parents have 
to convince us theyre suspect

former vice president walter mondale says the 
presidential campaigns run by both candidates this year were a 
disgrace and turned out worse than i originally thought 
i feel sick mondale said of the george bush and michael 
dukakis campaigns in an interview published in sunday editions of 
the star tribune 
mondale said part of the blame should go to television which 
revealed more about campaign media handlers than about the 
candidates themselves 
there is no substance mondale said of the campaign the 
candidates are hidden you dont get to ask questions the negatives 
have taken over and its mud every night 
mondale said he was especially angered by a news conference at 
boston harbor where bush declared himself an environmentalist 
labeled dukakis a polluter and then put a halt to questions 
politicians are permitted to throw mud from privileged 
sanctuaries and the negatives are driving substance off the playing 
field he said they can mount an attack and then not take 
questions about that attack first bush then dukakis you couldnt 
get a hold of any of them for questioning and for context 
mondale called for more frequent and longer debates than the two 
sessions held this year in which he said bush and dukakis delivered 
scripted lines and ignored substantive questions 
mondale predicted the problems he identified wouldnt be resolved 
until people get fed up with showbusiness presidential campaigns 
maybe its starting he said noting that this years voter 
turnout was only about 50 percent

peoples party in saturdays voting

democratic alliance its strongest rival the remainder went to 
independents and minor parties

the democratic alliance with a 671 victory in provincial assembly 
seats

majority coalition in two other provinces baluchistan and northwest 
frontier

the peoples party in eastern punjab where 60 percent of the 
countrys 107 million people live

ranks to form a government she would be the first woman to lead an 
islamic country

many demonstrators also shouted slogans demanding chuns arrest for 
corruption misrule and human rights abuses

there has been a spate of street protests urging chuns arrest in 
recent weeks on saturday thousands of students and dissidents 
battled riot police in downtown seoul when police stopped their 
march to chuns house

quizzed former defense minister choo youngbock about the alleged 
roles chun and the united states played in putting down the 1980

violence in which nearly 200 people were killed

independently to put down the uprising although the united states 
had operational control of south korean forces under the two

supporters and opponents of the uscanada free 
trade agreement combined lastminute electioneering sunday with a 
final advertising blitz on the eve of national elections 
prime minister brian mulroney buoyed by recent polls that showed 
his progressive conservative party back in the lead toured his 
native quebec while his leading rival liberal party leader john 
turner campaigned in vancouver british columbia 
both have focused on the trade deal the major issue in mondays 
race 
mulroney told a saturday news conference in quebec that he would 
call parliament back into session quickly to proceed with final 
passage of the pact which turner has vowed to reject 
in an interview with this weeks macleans magazine mulroney was 
quoted as saying he would try to pursue the trade agreement even if 
his party can only form a minority government 
the trade deal is a must for canadas future he was quoted 
as saying its a visionary instrument of job creation and new 
wealth and it is clearly something that is on the right side of 
history 
but turner has revived his campaign by saying the pact threatened 
to make canada a us colony 
speaking at a saturday campaign rally turner repeated his call 
to keep canada canadian for canadians and cancel the pact with a 
vote for his party 
in this weeks macleans turner was quoted as saying the pact 
would radically change the direction of our country it yields the 
economic levers of sovereignty our energy our investment policy 
our capital markets supplymanagement of agriculture 
the socialist new democratic party also opposes the agreement 
that president reagan and mulroney signed in january so only a 
majority conservative government ensures that it will proceed as 
scheduled 
the 10year agreement would start phasing out all remaining 
tariffs between canada and the united states on jan 1 it has 
passed the us congress but still needs canadian parliamentary 
approval 
mulroney spent the campaigns last weekend in his native 
frenchspeaking quebec where he is counting on support for the free 
trade agreement to come through with a solid showing for the 
provinces 75 seats 
were on the road to baiecomeau and were on the road to 
victory a confidentlooking mulroney said at a sunday rally in 
troisrivieres quebec the prime minister the first bilingual 
native of quebec to lead his party was returning to his hometown of 
baiecomeau for election day 
turner was in vancouver british columbia on the pacific coast 
where he will vote in his home district monday he reiterated his 
call for canadians to vote for his party to halt the trade agreement 
this election is still to be won he said 
turner hopes the liberals will come through best in the 99 seats 
of predominantly englishspeaking ontario where opposition to the 
agreement is strongest 
quebec and ontario have the majority of canadas 26 million 
people the house of commons was newly expanded this year to 295 
seats so a party needs 148 seats to form a majority government 
the conservatives are hoping for a second successive majority 
which has not happened in canada since 1953 mulroney led his party 
to an overwhelming victory four years ago taking 210 of the then 
282 seats in commons 
mulroney says the trade deal guarantees future canadian 
prosperity by assuring access to the larger us market 
canadians must not be tricked into squashing an agreement other 
countries would welcome with open arms the canadian alliance for 
trade and job opportunities a business lobbying group said in its 
final argument 
the toronto star which has opposed the trade agreement said in 
its sunday editorial that the deal is a magnet that will pull us 
economically culturally and politically into the us orbit 
a gallup poll published saturday by the star found the 
progressive conservatives back in the lead with 40 percent of 
decided voters to 35 percent for the liberals and 22 percent for the 
new democrats 
it said the regional distribution of the conservatives support 
indicated they could win a majority government of 162 seats with 
that margin of victory

foreign minister shimon peres told a group of 
american jews on sunday that his labor party will never make a 
political deal that would alter israels criteria for determining 
who is legally jewish 
an amendment supported by the rival likud bloc would give 
orthodox rabbis the exclusive authority to approve conversions to 
judaism the proposal is strongly opposed by conservative and reform 
jews 
we could not have built israel without american jews peres 
told a delegation from the new yorkbased national council of jewish 
women we must continue to keep our people together 
representatives of the womens council said they are concerned 
that some israeli parties are willing to use the who is a jew 
amendment as a political bargaining point 
this amendment would disenfranchise jews all over the world 
said nan rich a member of the councils national board of 
directors it would alienate many of us who feel we have a great 
stake in the future of israel 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc has told 
israels religious parties it would support the amendment the 
religious parties are a crucial factor in forming a coalition 
government 
religious parties won 18 of the 120 seats in parliament in the 
nov 1 election and neither likud nor the leftleaning labor 
acquired a majority with likud winning 40 seats and labor 39 
peres declared that his party would not change its position on 
the who is a jew issue even if it joins a coalition government 
led by likud 
we will never negotiate away our right to remain true to our 
positions peres told reporters after the meeting with the 
american delegation 
the proposed amendment would change the law of return that gives 
israeli citizenship to any jew who seeks it 
current law defines a jew as anyone born to a jewish mother or 
converted to judaism the change would nullify conversions performed 
by reform and conservative rabbis disqualifying a majority of the 
six million jews in north america 
earlier sunday 1000 british members of the international joint 
israel appeal opened its annual fundraising drive in jerusalem with 
a call to abandon the who is a jew amendment 
trevor chin president of the group in britain said changing the 
law of return would damage relations with jews around the world he 
said on israel radio israel has a constituency of world jewry 
that is unified for gods sake dont break it 
in atlanta ga reform leaders urged israel to reject the 
efforts by orthodox parties to amend the law of return 
the board of trustees of the union of american hebrew 
congregations meeting in atlanta sent a letter to israeli 
president cjaim herzog shamir and peres saying we implore you 
for the sake of israel and the jewish people to put jewish unity 
before considerations of political expediency

us attorney frank l mcnamara jr said sunday he 
will not resign despite a justice department investigation into 
allegations that he lied when he said he saw his predecessor smoke 
marijuana 
this is a mountain out of a molehill mcnamara said i 
think the whole thing has been a tremendous amount of nonsense you 
can look for that office to continue to function as a professional 
office with me at the helm 
mcnamara also said his own use of marijuana as recently as four 
years ago did not run counter to tough antidrug pronouncements 
what i did is what a lot of people who grew up and went to 
college in the 60s and 70s did i wish i hadnt done it im not 
happy i did it it was a mistake he said 
perhaps out of that i can be even more committed to the war 
against drugs he added 
mcnamara 41 the chief federal prosecutor for massachusetts 
faces a justice department inquiry into his claim to investigators 
that his predecessor william f weld smoked marijuana at a 1982 
party in virginia while still us attorney 
the justice department reported last week that an inquiry found 
evidence to contradict mcnamaras assertion 
i want any questions that may exist in anybodys mind about my 
motivations in this entire matter to be resolved mcnamara said in 
a telephone interview from his home in bolton thats why i 
requested the investigation 
mcnamara refused to discuss the inquiry by the departments 
office of professional responsibility or his accusations against 
weld whom mcnamara succeeded in april 1987 
mcnamara said he planned to hold a staff meeting monday to 
discuss the charges which aides said have virtually paralyzed the 
50lawyer office that prosecutes all federal crimes in massachusetts 
mcnamara took over as us attorney several weeks afer weld left 
for washington to head the justice departments criminal division 
the federal probe is examining whether mcnamara made up the 
marijuana story because weld had opposed his nomination on grounds 
that other prosecutors had more experience it also reportedly is 
examining whether mcnamara was forthright about smoking marijuana 
when he was questioned prior to confirmation for the job

a man who got into a wild shootout with police 
who tried to arrest him and then spent 2 weeks in hiding was 
acquitted sunday on attempted murder charges but convicted of 
weapons violations 
it was the second time this year that larry davis has been 
acquitted in a trial on march 3 he was found innocent of murdering 
four suspected drug dealers in the bronx 
when the verdicts were announced davis squeezed the hands of his 
lawyers lynne stewart and william kunstler according to kunstler 
tears came to davis eyes said kunstler the leftist lawyer who 
often portrays black clients like davis as victims of a racist 
system 
maybe there will be no more black sambos only black rambos 
kunstler said maybe this means there will be fewer shootings of 
blacks and young latinos in this city 
bronx district attorney paul gentile said he would ask the judge 
to give davis the maximum sentence on the weapons counts in the 
hope that it will help those police officers who received 
devastating injuries accept these verdicts 
the devastating fact remains that this jury of 12 people by 
their verdict found that the injuries that larry davis imposed upon 
these police officers in the course of their duties were justified 
by law gentile added 
the nov 19 1986 shootout occurred when 20 officers went to 
davis sisters apartment to arrest him for the four drugrelated 
slayings 
davis now 22 escaped unscathed from the apartment after trading 
more than 30 shots with nine officers he was captured after a 
17day manhunt one of the most extensive in the citys history 
prosecutors said davis opened fire to evade arrest the defense 
contended officers went to kill davis because of his knowledge of 
police corruption and that he fired in selfdefense 
in addition to the nine counts of attempted murder davis was 
acquitted of six counts of aggravated assault 
the jury which deliberated for five days convicted davis on six 
counts of criminal possession of weapons said ed mccarthy 
spokesman for the bronx district attorneys office 
davis faces a maximum penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison on the 
weapons counts when acting justice bernard fried imposes sentence 
in unrelated cases davis still faces two charges of murder 
a key issue was who fired first the police or davis the 
defense said it was a shotgunwielding officer presumably one who 
rushed in ahead of other officers prosecutors said it was davis 
whom they portrayed as a murderous crack dealer 
kunstler said the testimony of a ballistics expert showed that 
the first shot came from a police shotgun at close range closer 
than the prosecution maintained 
the truth of this case is justification defense attorney 
lynne stewart told the jury during closing arguments against all 
odds larry davis a son of the south bronx acted to save his life 
in the back bedroom of his sisters apartment 
testimony lasted four months with the prosecution calling 56 
witnesses most of them police and the defense calling 17 
jury selection began april 18 but pretrial maneuvers took months 
beginning with the prosecution successfully arguing that the defense 
was arbitrarily excluding whites from the jury 
the defense sought to establish that davis had unusual contacts 
with the police presenting testimony that officers frequently 
visited him at home the past five years prosecutors countered with 
police witnesses who said they visited the davis home in the course 
of numerous criminal investigations 
the defense also sought to show that the police fabricated the 
grounds for the arrest party as an excuse to kill davis prosecutors 
countered by trying to establish that davis was legitimately a prime 
suspect in the four killings

randy newmans songs many of them satirical or 
from an offthewall point of view probably need a format for 
theater different from a revue where its just and then he wrote 
 
the middle of nowhere which opened sunday night at the 
offbroadway astor place theater has a novel format the 
washeduponadesertisland idea combined with the oldtime 
minstrel show it sounds chancy but it works quite well its 
simpler than it sounds too 
brief program notes explain about the sections in 19th century 
whiteglove minstrel shows this allows newman songs to be grouped 
love songs songs about misfits songs about money for a reason 
roger robinson is whittling in an unused bus station when vondie 
curtishall as a soldier michael arkin as a salesman diana castle 
as a baltimorebound hitchhiker and tony hoylen carrying beer cans 
in a guitar case come in out of the rain this gives them 
individual identity miss castle for instance is the logical 
singer of newmans baltimore 
the shows two most inspired theatrical strokes are during the 
songs short people and lonely at the top as curtishall 
arkin and hoylen fervently spout the nonsensical prejudice in 
short people a carnival distorting mirror is slid in behind 
them on stage turning their own reflections into the object of 
their prejudice 
lonely at the top has its universality furthered by having it 
sung by robinson dressed as a janitor and pushing a dustmop 
newman put sarcasm and deep satire in song for the dead 
curtishall sings the shows most thoroughly serious song in his 
army uniform 
most of newmans songs are devised so the satire brings a smile 
curtishall glides through its money that i love as a slick 
dance number arkin becomes an ugly american for the selfish roll 
with the punches 
they just got married was probably included to show that 
with newman you cant guess the ending of a lyric hoylen gets to 
sing the funny maybe im doing it wrong and the pretty marie 
tracy friedman conceived wrote directed and choreographed the 
back of the bus band not seen plays instrumental accompaniment 
producers are frank basile lewis friedman tom o meyerhoff and 
albert nocciolino the middle of nowhere was first produced by 
the wisdom bridge theater in chicago 
theres a lot of entertainment to be had in an evening in this 
louisiana town so small the gas station went out of business when

armed soldiers guarded buses and 
military trucks shuttled stranded commuters monday as passenger jeep 
drivers went on strike in the capital 
police and other officials said several routes were paralyzed 
although service was operating near normal on others 
the strike was called by piston a militant association of about 
25000 passenger jeep drivers the jeeps are the major means of 
transport in the philippines several other jeep associations have 
announced they would join mondays strike 
piston has demanded a price rollback of commodities and a 
reduction in the cost of automotive spare parts following a 
presidential decree last week to reduce fares 
mayor jejomar binay of manilas financial district of makati made 
a lastminute appeal to striking drivers over governmentrun radio 
of nation to end the strike 
i wish to tell the drivers that they should give the government 
a chance to prove its promises binay said prices of 
commodities cannot be brought down overnight we are doing our best 
to bring prices of goods and spare down 
patrolman dick calizo said at least 20 military trucks have been 
sent out to help stranded passengers but no violence was reported as 
of midmorning 
classes at the university of santo tomas and other schools were 
suspended for the day because of the strike 
radio dzmm said there had been reports of jeepney drivers 
harassing other drivers who refused to join the strike which 
resulted in several fistfights and stoning incidents 
on sunday troops and police were placed on nationwide alert in 
preparation for the transport strike and for celebrations marking 
president corazon aquinos first 1000 days in office staterun 
media reported 
the staterun philippines news agency said gen renato de villa 
the military chief of staff issued the order to prevent violence 
during the strike 
de villa said armed troops would ride buses in the capital monday 
and that military trucks would prowl the streets to assist commuters 
who may be stranded by the strike government media said 
under the new transport fares a passenger has to pay a minimum 
of 3 cents for a 25mile ride the old rate was 4 cents but 
drivers actually charge a 5 cents 
there was no explanation why the military was placed on alert 
nationwide since the strike was called only for manila and its 
surrounding suburbs 
but monday marks mrs aquinos first 1000 days in office and 
military sources have said leftist or rightists opponents may try to 
foment unrest to distract from official ceremonies marking the 
benchmark date 
mrs aquino took office on feb 25 1986 after a popular 
uprising toppled the administration of ferdinand marcos and forced 
the philippine strongman to flee to exile in hawaii

they risk foreclosure proceedings if they do not make arrangements

coalition would push its demands for an effective antidrug 
campaign a higher minimum wage a national health care system 
improved child care and simplified sameday voter registration 
procedures

democratic nominee michael dukakis loss to bush because the party 
made gains in congressional and local races

when joe doherty broke out of a maximum 
security prison in northern ireland seven years ago the irish 
republican armys underground network of safehouses and sympathizers 
led him to this working class irishamerican suburb of new york 
doherty had been convicted with three others of killing a british 
army officer in a 1980 shootout 
in kearny he lived with an american girlfriend worked in 
construction and took a parttime job at clancys bar in manhattan 
it was sort of like being normal for once having a job and 
knowing youre not going to get assassinated or stopped in the 
streets because of your religion doherty said in a recent 
interview at the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan 
on june 28 1983 a group of fbi agents walked into clancys 
ordered a round of beers and took him into custody again 
since then the case has grown to involve the the white house 
the justice department civil rights activists and the leaders of 
great britain and ireland 
doherty doesnt deny being involved in the killing but says it 
was a political act and that he warrants political asylum in the 
united states 
the government disagrees the justice department calls doherty a 
terrorist and says he should be deported to britain 
the question of who gets political asylum and who is a refugee 
should be based on the law on facts and on circumstances said 
mary pike dohertys lawyer but the question really depends on 
which government youre fleeing if its a government with which the 
reagan administration wants to remain friendly then you cant get 
asylum 
if i was a cuban said doherty theres no way i would be 
deported 
doherty a bachelor has spent the better part of his 33 years in 
hiding or in prison he joined the ira in 1969 the year british 
troops were sent to the province to quell sectarian violence between 
protestant and catholic 
id watched my father live his life as a secondclass citizen 
and tell me to learn a trade and then emigrate said doherty i 
didnt want to tell my son at 17 that he had to go to canada to find 
a job because of his religion 
while lawyers debate his case doherty has spent the past five 
years in a 12footby6foot cell at the federal prison in new york 
i see this case as a complete rejection of the constitution by 
the government said paul odwyer a civil rights attorney in new 
york there is no other prisoner i know of who has been held for 
such a protracted period of time having committed no crime in the 
united states 
tom moseley a former justice department attorney who handled the 
doherty case said the bottom line is that doherty is a terrorist 
who killed someone 
we felt he should have been extradited to the uk on the 
grounds of murder and assault said moseley now in private 
practice in morristown 
some who sympathize with the iras goal of uniting the republic 
of ireland with the northern six counties that make up the british 
province of northern ireland consider doherty a folk hero 
the justice department went to court last year to stop 
philadelphians from naming doherty honorary grand marshal of their 
st patricks day parade 
free joe doherty graffiti adorns walls and sidewalks all over 
new york city at a new jersey bar not far from where doherty lived 
his picture hangs alongside that of bobby sands the ira prisoner 
who starved to death during a 1981 hunger strike at a british prison 
among dohertys supporters are new yorks roman catholic 
archbishop cardinal john oconnor amnesty international the 
american civil liberties union and the rev jesse jackson who 
visited doherty in prison in july 
but there also are influential forces fighting for dohertys 
extradition 
british prime minister margaret thatcher raised the case in talks 
with president reagan during a 1986 visit to washington 
sen richard lugar rind described the jailed ira man as an 
irish ghengis khan lugar led a successful fight to exclude the 
political exception clause from the centuryold usbritish 
extradition treaty when it was renegotiated in 1986 
the british government filed a formal request for dohertys 
extradition in 1983 it was denied in december 1984 by us district 
judge john e sprizzo in brooklyn who ruled that dohertys crime 
was a political act and qualified the defendant for political asylum 
the government appealed and us district judge charles s haight 
decided in dohertys favor a government appeal to the us court of 
appeals in new york upheld dohertys previous victories 
having failed to extradite doherty the justice department began 
deportation proceedings 
since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent 
doherty chose the independent republic of ireland and his decision 
was upheld by immigration judge howard i cohen in 1986 
if i was sent back to ireland i would be arrested and put in 
jail doherty said but hopefully it would be a humane place and 
i would get a fair hearing not like in the north 
the administration this time through the immigration and 
naturalization service appealed cohens order and again lost two 
more appeals and two more government defeats followed the latest 
coming nov 14 
meanwhile the republic of ireland under pressure from london 
and washington in december 1987 ratified the european convention on 
terrorism which calls for mandatory extradition of those deemed 
terrorists that eliminated dohertys irish option 
today doherty is pinning his hopes on winning asylum though 
after 5 years of court battles he isnt too optimistic about his 
chances for freedom 
i go to court i win he says but here i am

editors of tiny dollars amp sense magazine 
take no small pride in the fact their october 1987 cover story 
predicting financial upheaval was followed within days by the stock 
market crash 
we were kind of proud of that said arthur macewan who 
helped found the 8000circulation magazine in 1974 here we had a 
cover that came out and said crash in the first week of october 
and thats when it happened 
dollars amp sense is published by a collective of journalists and 
economists who offer an unabashedly socialist perspective on 
capitalism and its social implications 
but far from being hellbent for a systemic collapse the editors 
hope the nationally circulated magazine is used by trade unions 
students and others to gain insight into financial complexities 
we advocate more democratic openness in the economy said 
staff editor vince valvano we generally feel that people should 
have more input whether its about the specifics of their job or 
how decisions are made in a corporation they work for 
he said dollars amp sense is unique in helping to make 
understandable for regular working people the economic issues that 
he claims are covered in business magazines and newspaper sections 
as if theyre intended for managers business owners investors 
macewan a former economics professor at harvard college who now 
teaches at the university of massachusetts in boston said we 
attempt to focus a lot on the way people themselves affect economic 
events we dont simply look at people as being affected by this 
abstraction of the economy 
the collective says the crash cover story was less an uncanny 
prediction than a warning of economic trends creating greater 
divisions between the rich and the poor 
if you read it you recognized that we were not claiming to be 
predictors of the shortrun movement of the economy macewan said 
there was obviously a lot of luck in the particular timing of that 
issue 
the collective which is based in a former church that also 
houses a collection of other leftist groups in this working class 
citys union square also publishes real world macro an 
economics reader for classroom use 
among dollars amp senses boosters are economist john kenneth 
galbraith journalist alexander cockburn and democratic us rep 
ron dellums of california 
it isnt caught up in the established cliches of economic and 
financial reporting galbraith said in a recent telephone 
interview theres no field in which this is more important 
the overall philosophy is that there are serious problems with 
capitalism said staff editor tim wise the coming crash wasnt 
so much a prediction as an examination of the underlying instability 
in the economy 
although the economic fallout from the crash was less than some 
expected macewan says the national deficit trade deficit and 
foreign debt are looming problems 
we were not the only ones saying this although the media in 
general and the common feeling is a very pollyannaish one that 
somehow as long as the stock market crash hasnt reoccured in a few 
months everything is fine again he said 
the monthly magazines philosophy may be best conveyed by a 
directmail campaign envelope featuring two tuxedoclad partygoers 
holding goblets of champagne it reads they threw a party you 
werent invited now they want you to pay the bill 
we generally attract those who are frustrated they dont see 
more analysis and information on economic affairs in progressive 
publications and mainstream publications present only a mainstream 
businessoriented view wise said

tyson foods inc on sunday extended its 941 
million hostile buyout offer for holly farms corp and said it 
planned to sue to block key provisions of holly farms white knight 
merger with rival conagra 
tyson the nations largest poultry processor was stung thursday 
when memphis tennbased holly farms said it had agreed to be 
acquired by conagra in a stock swap valued at about 1 billion 
tyson extended its 52 a share offer which was to expire last 
friday through 5 pm est dec 16 said james b blair the 
companys general counsel 
blair also said that about 33 million or 182 percent of holly 
farms 181 million outstanding common shares had been tendered 
under its offer as of friday 
blair said tyson would sue in delaware chancery court to block a 
socalled lockup option giving conagra the right to buy key holly 
farms assets in the event a third company acquires holly farms and 
the bustup fee holly farms has agreed to pay conagra if their 
merger falls through 
such merger provisions frequently are used to discourage rival 
bidders from continuing their pursuit of a company 
theyve taken the best part of the company the part we want 
the worst and put an option price to conagra at less than its 
market value blair said in a telephone interview that option 
triggers if their merger if defeated for some reason what that is 
doing is depriving the holly shareholder of the right to make a 
choice 
the option covers two texas processing plants and their support 
systems including breeder flocks and hatcheries blair said the 
two plants are the lowestcost producers held by holly farms he 
said also included are holly farms biggest processing and cooking 
plants in north carolina and the best piece of the companys food 
service business 
that isnt all their chicken business but its the best 
blair said 
under the terms of the proposed conagra merger holl farms 
stockholders would receive the equivalent of 5925 worth of conagra 
stock for each share of holly farms based on the average stock 
price to be set shortly before shareholders meet to approve the plan 
based on stock prices last week the deal would be worth about 1 
billion 
telephone calls to the headquarters of conagra in omaha neb 
and holly farms went unanswered sunday night 
holly farms shares fell 37 cents to 5150 a share friday on the 
new york stock exchange while conagra shares dipped 12 cents to 
2750 tyson shares rose 50 cents to 1562 a share in national 
over the counter trading
