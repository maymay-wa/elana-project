much of the world plans reductions in military 
spending but singapore a thriving citystate with no apparent 
enemies is building more bomb shelters 
about 200 shelters and the same number of air raid sirens will 
be completed in the next year and singapore should be ready for its 
first nationwide drill in 1992 home minister shanmugam jayakumar 
said 
the more shelters the better he declared this will mean 
more protection for the public 
protection from what 
southeast asia has been among the worlds more stable regions 
recently but government leaders insist security remains a problem 
despite the improvement in ussoviet relations 
that will not change even if the superpowers reduce their 
military forces in the region said lee hsien loong 37 eldest son 
of prime minister lee kuan yew 
lee addressed parliament as second defense minister he also has 
the trade and industry portfolio and is widely viewed as a future 
prime minister 
if the united states significantly cuts back its military 
forces in the region this will not be a signal for singapore also 
to reduce our forces he said it will be reason for concern 
over a potentially destabilizing change in the regional balance of 
power 
singapore is the only country in the region that openly backs 
continued us military presence officials in several other 
capitals express private support and public nonalignment 
except for singapore the nations of southeast asia think the 
american security shield will stand forever regardless of what 
they do said rep patricia schroeder leader of a house armed 
services committee delegation that toured the area recently 
they can boast of their nonaligned purity while reaping the 
harvest made possible by the american military the colorado 
democrat said 
if the united states cannot renew the leases on philippine bases 
and is forced to leave it will need help from friends in the 
region she said singapore has offered greater access to its air 
and naval facilities 
in his speech to parliament lee said the government would not 
cut defense spending reduce the armed forces or end compulsory 
military training whatever the united states did 
singapore is about the size of chicago with no natural 
resources except a strategic location between the pacific and 
indian oceans and the skills of its 26 million people 76 percent 
of whom are ethnic chinese 
the army navy and air force have 55000 regulars and conscripts 
plus about 200000 reservists analysts rate the singapore armed 
forces among the best trained and equipped in the region 
because it is so small singapore often holds major military 
exercises in brunei taiwan or elsewhere 
it conducts bilateral maneuvers with other members of the 
association of southeast asian nations indonesia malaysia 
thailand brunei and the philippines but asean as a whole does 
not function as a military alliance 
no other asean country is slashing its defense expenditures 
demobilizing its armed forces or acting on the assumption that it 
no longer faces any external threats lee told parliament it 
would be foolhardy for singapore to do so alone 
diplomats from asean countries said the countries awaited 
resolution of two regional problems the search for a peace formula 
in cambodia and negotiations on the us bases 
singapore is in the five power defense agreement with australia 
britain malaysia and new zealand the 1971 pact provides for 
consultation and cooperation among members if singapore or malaysia 
is attacked or threatened 
defense spending is about 6 percent of singapores gross 
national product which means the equivalent of 19 billion in the 
current budget 
us defense spending in 1988 was 61 percent of the gross 
national product or 2931 billion 
some defense funds go to a domestic arms industry that has grown 
so fast it now seeks export orders and diversification 
it was started less than 20 years ago and includes more than 40 
companies under the singapore technologies umbrella the 
governmentbacked companies evolved from making small arms under 
license to designing howitzers and upgrading jet fighters 
singapores total defense plan was drafted in 1983 while 
vietnamese military forces occupied cambodia and aims to involve 
the civilian population with the military in a national emergency 
the first air raid drill sent 3000 volunteers swarming into a 
new subway station in 1988 
nine underground stations have been fortified to shelter 100000 
people shelters also are being built in schools hospitals and 
other public facilities 
other civil defense training covers rescue methods blood 
donation mobilization of private motor vehicles and emergency 
distribution of food and water

heavily armed police 
poured into this mohawk reservation after two people were slain 
but gov mario cuomo on wednesday ruled out force to put down a 
9monthold dispute over gambling 
us and canadian police sealed off the 28000acre reservation 
that straddles the border 
cuomo said he had ordered the new york army national guard to 
assist state police but would not order guardsmen onto the 
reservation 
we will not send military force because of the risk of 
bloodshed because of what it would provoke cuomo told reporter 
in albany 
before you use military force you should use the force of 
reason 
representatives from six governments were tentatively scheduled 
to meet thursday in montreal to discuss the st regis sovereignty 
issue according to micha menczer attorney for the mohawk council 
officials from ontario quebec and new york federal officials 
from the us and canada and indian leaders will be represented at 
the talks which will include discussion of the removal of weapons 
from the reservation and the restoration of law and order menczer 
said 
new york state police carrying shotguns and the quebec 
provincial force entered the reservation tuesday night and 
wednesday after weeks of violence between pro and antigambling 
factions culminated in the shooting deaths of two mohawk men 
earlier in the day 
cuomo said the national guard was used to transport troopers and 
provide equipment at armories in nearby towns 
on the canadian side canadian troops provided communications 
assistance 
state troopers denied entry onto the reservation to everyone but 
residents they would not divulge the number of troopers on the 
reservation but residents said the combined uscanadian police 
forces numbered in the hundreds 
weve got an armed invasion said diane lazores a 
spokeswoman for the warrior society an armed progambling group 
lazores said state police also were restricting movement of 
residents within the reservation despite promises made before the 
action 
if they want an international incident theyre going to get 
one she said 
the reservation was peaceful wednesday after nearly a month of 
nights filled with sporadic gunfire and brawls 
young mohawk children waited for their school bus beside armed 
state troopers while many other mohawks of all ages stayed at home 
im not venturing out said reservation resident jack 
hubert a recent retiree i dont want to spend my golden years 
being shot at 
hubert like the large majority of the approximately 9000 
people living on the reservation has taken no direct part in the 
feuding between the two mohawk factions 
were not all looking to get shot just a few are he said 
up to 600 mohawks fled to a refugee center in ontario last week 
after a week of nightly violence 
junior edwards whose body was found near his home in snye 
quebec on tuesday was described by members of the warrior society 
as progambling matthew pyke was shot to death early tuesday while 
walking to the house of a fellow antigambling activist 
officials said the deaths prompted state police to break their 
policy of not setting foot on the reservation unless invited by 
mohawk leaders 
state police capt richard garrant said troopers would stay on 
mohawk land to maintain some type of stability until further 
orders arrived from the governors office 
fletcher graves a mediator from the us justice department who 
has helped the mohawks resolve other disputes arrived on the 
reservation wednesday afternoon according to warriors society 
member john boots 
earlier graves said i dont know what my role will be until 
i get there well talk to every party 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the bush administration would not get involved we have no 
intention to intervene he said its a matter that needs to be 
resolved locally 
boots said state police maj robert leu also arrived to speak 
with the mohawks 
he said the presence of the state police beyond investigating 
the two deaths was a doublecross and the warriors have asked 
the state police to dismantle their roadblocks and leave the 
reservation 
i dont want to make a comment on what the reprisal would be 
when 10000 indians get angry boots said 
barbara barnes spokeswoman for the antigambling faction said 
she was glad that police would be on the reservation 
people here have no peace of mind as soon as the police 
leave the shots will start again she said 
the issue of gambling on the reservation has been at the center 
of escalating violence since last summer when an fbiled gambling 
raid triggered a 12day standoff between a progambling group and 
state police 
the fbi claimed the mohawks had violated federal gaming 
regulations the mohawks claim they are not bound by state or 
federal gambling laws 
progambling forces say the reservations six casinos whose 
slot machines craps tables and other games draw busloads of 
patrons are an economic boon opponents argue they encourage 
prostitution and drug use and threaten traditional ways 
last summer a mob of antigamblers burned down a casino 
sporadic violence were reported in the fall and winter but 
tensions mounted in march when gambling opponents blockaded roads 
to keep outsiders away from the highstakes casinos 
last week progamblers tore down the blockades in a hail of 
gunfire

after barely six weeks on the job kennedy 
center chairman james d wolfensohn is clear about his goals give 
the marble cultural palace a 30 million facelift fill its stages 
with arts festivals and lay the welcome mat for innercity 
audiences 
im not worried about competition he says im worried 
about my capacity to deliver 
wolfensohn 56 has become a frequent flier aboard the shuttle 
between washington and new york where he also is chairman of 
carnegie hall and president of a highpowered investment banking 
firm since he took command of the kennedy center last month 
without pay 
it didnt take wolfensohn long to discover that the kennedy 
center is an institution in trouble he found a deepening financial 
crisis generally listless programming with a few bright spots 
and nagging confusion over the centers proper artistic role and 
future direction 
when he took the job wolfensohn warned the centers trustees 
that he could spare only two days a week in washington actually 
the time has stretched to three or four days including weekends 
im working very hard he said in an interview but i 
think now is the time to do it by the end of the summer i want to 
have my arms around the problems i dont think i will have solved 
them but i think i will understand them 
the most urgent problem was spotted during wolfensohns 
preliminary examination of the kennedy centers balance sheets 
which showed a cumulative debt of more than 15 million and the 
desperate need for 30 million in longdelayed renovation and 
repairs 
wolfensohn said he won a commitment from white house chief of 
staff john h sununu and the centers congressional trustees to 
find 45 million in federal funds to pay off the debt and refurbish 
the 18yearold national center for the performing arts 
wolfensohn agreed to shoulder responsibility for tapping private 
contributors for the 12 million to 15 million required to finance 
current levels of programming after revenues from ticket sales 
rentals and other sources expanded programming may drive costs to 
20 million to 25 million he estimated 
excitement unfortunately comes very expensive today he 
said and to make this place exciting were going to need a lot 
of money 
wolfensohn said quality programming is the key to attracting 
private support and turning the kennedy center around although 
built by the government the center receives no direct federal 
support for the shows it presents 
wolfensohn wants to build on such innovative but 
littlerecognized kennedy center programs as the annual american 
college theater festival and its imagination celebration arts 
festival for children 
he is starting big he has announced plans for a texas festival 
in june 1991 the first of a series intended to showcase the best 
of performing artists from different states the same year hed 
like to mount a festival featuring artists from the newly emerging 
democracies of eastern europe 
in 1992 hes planning a festival of the americas with 
performances by artists from italy spain and north and south 
america including native americans to mark the 500th anniversary 
of columbus discovery of the new world 
wolfensohn who grew up in a poor family in sydney australia 
has a personal interest in overcoming the kennedy centers 
reputation among local minority residents as an elitist haven for 
the wealthy 
you may think im naive but nourishment of the spirit is not 
a class or financial matter he said i grew up with not a lot 
of money and i used to go to free concerts in sydney it enriched 
my life enormously 
wolfensohn is mulling a plan to bus 30 or 40 poor families from 
innercity neighborhoods to the kennedy center every week to 
introduce them to the performing arts at little or no cost 
to bring a child here who then goes home and gets no 
reinforcement has been a substantial waste of the experience he 
said very often its the parent whos never been here that you 
make your first and biggest hit with 
his goal is to make them feel they can come here and enjoy an 
evening being taken out of themselves into a new world into a 
world of ideas or dreams if we can give them that even for a few 
hours it can make a difference in their lives

maine voters will reelect a governor in 
november the question is which one 
the choice is between republican gov john r mckernan and his 
democratic predecessor rep joseph e brennan brennan has filled 
mckernans former seat in congress since the two exchanged jobs in 
the 1986 election 
the campaign is decidedly issueoriented the economic slump 
that has gripped the northeast environmental pollution and labor 
relations all loom large but style may prove as decisive as 
substance in the outcome of a race many regard as a tossup so far 
mckernan who at 41 is brennans junior by 14 years is the 
consummate contemporary politician with boyish good looks a 
relaxed public speaking manner and a penchant for staging events 
tailored for the evening news since february 1989 he has been 
married to maines other member of the us house republican rep 
olympia j snowe 
brennan comes across as credible and selfconfident and he 
commands a loyal following that has intensified since he announced 
in late december that he would take on mckernan but he is more 
reserved almost shy at times and has never seemed entirely 
comfortable before tv cameras or large audiences 
running the state government is a lot more than style and 
glitz and photo opportunities and public relations brennan 
observed sizing up his opposition 
lackluster is a word mckernan uses to sum up his challenger 
his administration really didnt have a lot of vision and not a 
lot of energy not a lot of creative ideas to try to prepare for 
the future 
brennan was forced out of the governorship by a provision in the 
state constitution that bars a chief executive who has served two 
consecutive fouryear terms from succeeding himself an obstacle 
that was eliminated by his hiatus in congress 
his decision to give up his seat in southern maines 1st 
congressional district has opened new opportunities for numerous 
other players in a political variation of musical chairs 
among the five democrats competing for the house nomination are 
state attorney general james e tierney the partys nominee in the 
fourway gubernatorial runoff that mckernan won in 1986 and former 
state housing chief elizabeth h mitchell who unsuccessfully 
challenged republican sen william s cohen in 1984 the twoway 
republican race includes david f emery who held the 1st district 
seat for eight years prior to mckernans arrival 
in the gubernatorial race brennan has taken the early lead in 
fundraising in campaign finance reports filed tuesday he claimed 
354000 in contributions and more than 285000 cash on hand 
through april 24 
mckernan who had 148000 available out of contributions 
totaling 273000 said he put off intensive fundraising until 
after the legislative session that ended last month 
brennan said mckernans inferior showing reflects a loss of 
confidence in his performance as governor 
each candidate has said he hopes to raise more than 1 million 
by the general election on nov 6 neither faces opposition in the 
june 12 primary 
mckernan became the first to take his message to the airwaves 
this week running a tv campaign commercial touting his skills at 
managing state government in adverse times a second ad was to air 
during the weekend 
a prime focus of the commercials and of the campaign is 
mckernans response to what was once a projected state budget 
shortfall of 210 million through mid1991 so far three of 
mckernans new england counterparts the governors of vermont 
massachusetts and connecticut have announced amid similar fiscal 
problems that they would not seek reelection 
mckernans budgetbalancing solution was approved by the 
democraticdominated legislature with little tampering 
weve managed this regional problem better than any other 
state in the same boat and we did so without raising taxes like so 
many others mckernan said 
but brennan has hammered away at the issue questioning why the 
administration did not recognize the seriousness of the problem 
sooner he also charges that the steps taken to balance the budget 
ultimately will force increases in municipal property taxes 
mckernan has challenged brennan to offer better alternatives and 
portrays his opponent as a congressman who is at the top of the 
charts in ratings by the special interests and has supported 
all sorts of new federal spending 
the message well be able to send thanks to his record is 
that he was a lackluster leader for the state a big spender and 
that my reelection is critical to keeping maine moving forward 
mckernan said

the interior department is pressing ahead with 
a trade of coalrich wyoming land for a pristine view in grand 
teton national park despite criticism that the taxpayers will get 
cheated on the deal 
rep mike synar dokla chairman of a house government 
operations subcommittee investigating the swap said the government 
is giving away too much coal at the fire sale price of 27 
cents a ton 
in exchange the government would receive a ban on development 
of the largest tract of private land in the wyoming national park 
both the rights to the coal and the park land were valued at 56 
million 
synars environment subcommittee which was reviewing the 
exchange at a hearing today released documents concluding that 
taxpayers could lose up to 180 million in the transaction because 
the coal was undervalued 
steve goldstein chief spokesman for interior secretary manuel 
lujan jr said he expects the exchange to be finalized in the next 
few weeks despite the objections 
he said the valuation of the coal was correct and based not only 
on real value but the intrinsic value of prohibiting 
development on 1100 acres on the park 
the 207 million tons of coal is under a 2500acre tract near 
sheridan wyo the park land is the jy ranch owned by 
businessmanconservationist laurance s rockefeller 
rockefeller in 1987 donated the conservation easement 
basically a scenic view that must remain undeveloped to the 
sloankettering memorial institute for cancer research in new york 
city the institute would obtain rights to the coal in the trade 
sloankettering plans to sell the coal interest and use the 
proceeds immediately to advance its cancer research programs 
bruce a bugbee a representative of the institute said in written 
testimony for todays hearing 
rockefeller would retain ownership of the land and the right to 
construct one additional residence at a specified location 
in other testimony submitted for todays hearing david c 
oneal assistant interior secretary for land and minerals 
management said the deal appears to be an outstanding 
opportunity to protect teton national park from future development 
while avoiding federal costs associated with acquisition to prevent 
potential development 
synar said wednesday that it strains credulity that the 
department valued the 207 million tons of coal at 27 cents a ton 
at a time of staggering federal deficits the department of 
the interior should abandon any thought of disposing of publicly 
owned assets at fire sale prices he said 
a major issue in valuing the coal was whether it would be mined 
or left in the ground 
oneal said there was no expressed interest in the coal by 
mining companies from 1986 until 1989 a period when the department 
was moving forward with the swap the initial agreement on the 
exchange was approved in 1985 
but bugbee made clear in november that by that time the cancer 
institute had identified parties interested in purchasing the 
coal who are willing to provide assurances they will proceed 
immediately with the goal of obtaining permits prior to 1995 
while the interior department said its 27 cents a ton value is 
the right amount for undeveloped coal in the ground synar said the 
value should be based on the price that mined coal would have 
brought the government 
when coal is mined on federal land the government and the state 
where the vein is located share a royalty of 125 percent of the of 
the selling price 
in march 1989 paul r cleary deputy commissioner of the 
wyoming state land and farm loan office wrote another state 
official assuming a value of 7 per ton and a royalty rate of 
125 percent development of the federal coal would generate over 
180 million in royalties of which the state would receive 
some 90 million 
according to the publication coal week which follows current 
prices similar mined coal in wyoming sold in midapril for 460 
per ton on long term contracts usually 15 to 25 years and 380 
to 460 for contracts under a year 
at 460 the federalstate royalty would be about 119 million 
at 380 it would total about 98 million

lee atwater will be the one to decide if his 
health permits him to continue serving as republican party 
chairman say gop officials around the country 
until lee decides what he wants to do i think well defer to 
lee before we start speculating said frank visco the california 
republican party chairman visco dismissed rumors that atwater 
would soon be replaced by commerce secretary robert mosbacher a 
close friend of president bush 
mosbachers was one of several names circulating as possible 
replacements for atwater others included drew lewis a former 
pennsylvania gop chairman who served as transportation secretary 
during the reagan administration and donald hodel twice a member 
of the reagan cabinet as energy and interior secretary 
mary matalin chief of staff at the republican national 
committee said mosbacher called atwater to denounce the report as 
untrue the white house also said bush had no intention of making 
the change 
atwater has received radiation and chemotherapy treatments for a 
tumor on the right side of his brain 
matalin said atwater was in george washington university 
hospital receiving treatment for a blood clot in his left leg 
dr stuart grossman a neurosurgeon and oncologist at johns 
hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore said blood 
clots are not unusual for brain tumor patients 
something predisposes patients with brain tumors to develop 
clots in the legs he said we dont know why that is 
patients with clots are treated with a blood thinner and 
generally do quite well he said 
matalin said she and pollster robert teeter visited atwater at 
the hospital sunday and reviewed data on 1990 races 
this was the best hes been she said according to matalin 
doctors plan to do another electronic scan of the tumor in the next 
couple of weeks to assess the effectiveness of the radiation and 
chemotherapy treatments 
theyre looking for no change she said an indication that 
the tumor has stopped growing 
i was very startled to read that thing about mosbacher said 
jennifer dunn the washington state gop chairman i called right 
away to find out what was going on it turned out it was yet 
another rumor 
i dont see any change and i cant imagine that george bush 
would do that said anne ansteine the pennsylvania chairman 
the rnc meets in chicago in july what would otherwise be a 
routine meeting is certain to be watched closely for signs of 
whether atwater will return at some point as a fulltime national 
chairman 
lees going to make that decision said michele davis 
executive director of the republican governors association 
the biggest concern is whats going to happen is he going to 
be able to come back said burton s kruglick the arizona gop 
chairman he said the july meeting was when its going to have to 
be decided one way or the other 
party officials insisted that atwaters illness has not 
disrupted the routine operations of the rnc in this election year 
we havent noticed an impact because the programs were in 
place earlier in the year said kruglick 
its functioning really well said bruce benson the 
colorado republican chairman 
missouri gov john ashcroft chairman of republican governors 
association said were going to raise two to three times as 
much money as has ever been raised before for republican governors 
lee atwaters a big part of getting that done 
by march if we dont have our act together on a 
statebystate basis theres no way we would have made that up

a drug can stop and even reverse the loss of bone 
in the spine and prevent fractures in older women with 
osteoporosis a common condition in which the bones become brittle 
according to a study today 
danish doctors tested the medicine called etidronate 
between 15 million and 20 million americans are estimated to 
have osteoporosis 
the condition is blamed for 13 million fractures annually in 
people over age 45 it is especially common among older women who 
develop osteoporosis after menopause when their bodies make less 
estrogen 
the research directed by dr tommy storm at sundby hospital in 
copenhagen was published in the new england journal of medicine 
it was financed by procter amp gambles norwich eaton 
pharmaceuticals which makes etidronate 
the doctors performed a threeyear comparison study on 66 women 
ages 56 to 75 they found that the vertebral bone mineral content 
of those who got the drug increased 7 percent while it decreased 3 
percent in a comparison group who got dummy pills 
the number of vertebral fractures also decreased substantially 
in the etidronate group 
the medicine is approved by the food and drug administration for 
treatment of pagets disease a bone ailment

america can do little about islamic rage 
against the united states except try to understand it and not 
exacerbate it says bernard lewis a scholar of the moslem world 
in a prestigious lecture wednesday night lewis tried to explain 
the resentment and anger of the moslem masses toward the west 
and the united states 
for vast numbers of middle easterners westernstyle economic 
methods brought poverty westernstyle political institutions 
brought tyranny even westernstyle warfare brought defeat he 
said 
it is hardly surprising that so many were willing to listen to 
voices telling them that the old islamic ways were best and that 
their only salvation was to throw aside the pagan and infidel 
innovations of the reformers and to return to the true path which 
god has prescribed for his people 
the britishborn lewis 73 author of 20 books on islam is a 
former history professor at the university of londons school of 
oriental and african studies and at princeton university until his 
retirement in 1986 
he delivered the 19th annual jefferson lecture an honor 
bestowed by the national endowment for the humanities the lecture 
carries a 10000 stipend lewis will repeat the talk tonight at 
the hoover institution and stanford university in california 
in time lewis said more tolerant strands in islamic tradition 
may prevail over the forces now dominant 
but we of the west can do little or nothing to affect the 
outcome he said it is an issue which moslems and only moslems 
must decide among themselves 
and in the meantime we must take great care on all sides to 
avoid the danger of a new era of religious wars arising from the 
exacerbation of differences and the revival of ancient 
longforgotten prejudices 
the detestation of the west as demonstrated by such episodes 
as the 444day tehran embassy hostage crisis that ended in 1981 
is partly an outgrowth of moslem humiliation lewis said 
in the islamic world he said is a growing awareness among 
the heirs of an old proud and for long dominant civilization of 
having been overtaken overborne and overwhelmed by those whom they 
had long regarded as their inferiors 
the hatred of america is only the latest outbreak in a battle 
between the islamic world and christendom that already has lasted 
for 14 centuries lewis said and islam was winning the battle for 
the first 1000 years 
the recent resurgence of islamic fundamentalism he said gives 
shape to the mass anger 
the instinct of the masses is not false in locating the 
ultimate source of these cataclysmic changes in the west and in 
attributing the disruption of their old way of life to the impact 
of western domination western influence or western precept and 
example he said 
since america is the leader of the west he said america has 
become the target 
lewis argued that it was crucially important that americans 
study islams heritage and understand the hatred so as not to be 
provoked into an equally historic but also equally irrational 
reaction against them

lawyers for former hud secretary samuel r 
pierce jr say a former aide who testified that pierce manipulated 
federal programs to help friends is an admitted cheat and liar 
who cant be believed 
dubois l gilliam who has admitted taking bribes and rigging 
housing subsidies while pierces assistant finishes a week of 
testimony friday before a congressional subcommittee investigating 
scandals at department of housing and urban development during the 
reagan administration 
the panels chairman rep tom lantos dcalif said pierce 
should drop his use of fifth amendment protections against 
selfincrimination and agree to appear immediately to respond 
under oath to any of the testimony of mr gilliam 
after denouncing lantos panel for an insatiable appetite for 
publicity pierces lawyers attacked gilliams credibility 
wednesday 
mr pierce denies all allegations of wrongdoing and improper 
conduct attorney paul l perito said it is inconceivable that 
this subcommittee has accepted at face value the unsubstantiated 
testimony of an admitted cheat and liar who repeatedly violated the 
publics trust while at hud 
he charged that gilliam admitted to 10 to 12 additional felonies 
in his first two days of testimony before the panel testimony for 
which he received a courts grant of immunity from further 
prosecution 
gilliam is in the middle of an 18month federal prison sentence 
for abuses of hud programs 
although perito said gilliams motive in testifying was an early 
release from prison lantos and other members of the house 
government operations subcommittee on housing and employment said 
they found him a credible witness 
lantos said gilliam is eligible for parole at any time and will 
have served out his sentence by the end of the year while granted 
immunity he risks a perjury conviction if he lies to the panel 
i have no reason to lie no reason whatsoever gilliam said 
pierce himself is under investigation by an independent counsel 
gilliam said he pierce and others manipulated programs to 
direct project grants and lucrative subsidies to friends sometimes 
before any formal applications were made 
gilliam said he arranged for more profits for himself after he 
left hud by securing subsidies for future business partners he 
said he secretly removed incriminating documents from the agency in 
a medicine bag 
he linked president bush while vice president to a 1985 
federal grant of 500000 for a hispanic trade center in kansas 
city mo 
gilliam said he took unusual steps to award the grant in 1985 
after hector barreto then president of the us hispanic chamber 
of commerce and a political supporter of bush and president reagan 
met with the vice president 
gilliam said that after telling barreto that his proposal for a 
feasibility study was not eligible for funding by hud under the 
secretarys discretion program barreto met with bush 
later the same afternoon gilliam said pierces executive 
assistant deborah gore dean indicated to me that she had 
received a call from the vice presidents staff people indicating 
their support and wanted to get the project funded 
as a result gilliam said he persuaded a kansas city official 
to make the grant from the citys community development block grant 
funds provided by hud in turn gilliam said he arranged to have a 
special grant from the secretarys discretionary fund go to kansas 
city to replace that money 
in other words lets make a deal you do this and ill do 
this gilliam said 
barreto told the kansas city star that he met with bush more 
than 25 times since 1980 and often discussed various projects that 
needed funding 
he said he specifically discussed the trade center with bush at 
least two or three times but he denied that he used his political 
connections to receive grant money if that were the case we 
would be swimming in money right now he said 
this is not like we get these grants so we can pay 
ourselves barreto said i think it the trade center was a 
project that made sense 
he said the project was still in the works 
asked for comment on gilliams testimony steve hart a deputy 
white house press secretary said we dont know anything about 
it 
gilliam left the agency in 1987 when huds inspector general 
began investigating him despite that cloud gilliam said he 
requested and was given approval from pierce through an aide to 
receive grants for lowincome housing renovations in effect a 
severance payment worth 1 million or more in resale value to 
developers 
he ultimately did not receive them but gilliam said ms dean 
discussed his request for 400 units of subsidy with pierce and 
returned saying i could have 250 i couldnt have 400 because 
i was being greedy

after losing a 30month battle 
against extradition joseph schwammberger was flown to west germany 
to face charges he oversaw or took part in the slaughter of 
thousands of jews as head of a nazi labor camp 
schwammberger 78 was put aboard a lufthansa commercial flight 
to frankfurt on wednesday accompanied by a doctor his attorney and 
west german officials of interpol the international police 
organization 
argentinas supreme court late last month upheld the extradition 
of schwammberger who fled to argentina after escaping from allied 
authorities in the late 1940s but was captured at an argentine 
ranch in 1987 
he is charged with provoking the deaths of several thousand 
jews and of personally killing some said wolfgang siegel a 
spokesman for the west german embassy 
siegel said that after arriving in frankfurt schwammberger 
would be taken to stuttgart site of the court that had asked for 
his extradition 
schwammberger is accused of commanding forced labor camps at 
przemysl and mielec in nazioccupied poland at which thousands of 
inmates mostly jews were executed survivors testified he starved 
prisoners used dogs to tear them apart and threw people alive 
into fires 
rabbi marvin hier of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles 
which gathered evidence against schwammberger said in a telephone 
interview here we are not dealing with an administrator but 
with a man who participated directly a man who rolled up his 
sleeves and bloodied his hands every day 
this case will be exceptional in the sense that 45 years after 
the crimes were committed the accused will be brought to trial 
hier said adding that the center has 73 witnesses who are prepared 
to testify against schwammberger 
hier said schwammberger was arrested by the french army in 1945 
but escaped three years later from a train taking him to us 
military authorities in austria for trial 
using his own name schwammberger eventually settled in 
argentina worked at a petrochemical plant in la plata 30 miles 
south of the buenos aires and obtained argentine citizenship in 
1965 hier reported 
a stuttgart court ordered his arrest in 1973 at the time he 
was believed to be living in argentina where there is a sizeable 
population of germanspeaking immigrants many nazis fled to south 
america following the defeat of adolf hitlers germany 
in october 1987 the simon wiesenthal center placed 
schwammberger on its most wanted nazi war criminals list argentine 
newspapers published the list and police received information 
about schwammberger 
he was taken into custody on nov 13 1987 at a ranch in huerta 
grande 500 miles northwest of buenos aires he has been held in 
jail since 
defense attorneys asked argentina to reject an extradition 
request on the ground that schwammberger was an argentine citizen 
or to hold the trial in argentina 
the federal appeals court in la plata rejected their argument in 
august ruling that the crimes schwammberger is accused of 
committing occurred before he was an argentine citizen the supreme 
court upheld that ruling on march 23 
in 1960 adolph eichmann a major figure in devising the final 
solution in which jews were rounded up and executed was 
kidnapped in buenos aires by israeli agents convicted at a trial 
in jerusalem and hanged 
dutch officials have asked argentine police to look for abraham 
kipp who was sentenced to death for crimes committed against jews 
during the war in 1953 kipp was naturalized as an argentine 
citizen

small land animals including the 
ferocious 6ounce mutant ninja chipmunk thrived while an 
environmental crisis killed off most giant dinosaurs more than 100 
million years ago a researcher found 
dr robert bakker a university of colorado paleontologist said 
fossils recently unearthed from a 130millionyearold deposit in a 
rock quarry in wyoming showed small dinosaurs mammals turtles and 
other animals flourished in the early cretaceous period a few 
million years after the giant dinosaurs that lived in the jurassic 
period became extinct 
the new fossils are the remains of animals that lived in a 
crisis interval during the early cretaceous period and this is the 
first rock layer that seems to record just what happened and why 
bakker said wednesday 
his preliminary findings were published april 15 in the 
proceedings of the fourth north american paleontological congress 
with several colleagues bakker who first identified the fossil 
beds in the 1970s unearthed a wide array of fossil miniatures 
from the 10 to 12foot thick deposit known as breakfast bench 
near the town of rock river 
the specimens date to the earliest part of the cretaceous 
period a transitional period following the demise of longnecked 
giant dinosaurs such as brontosaurus supersaurus and diplodocus 
bakker said the deposit provides evidence of a classic case of 
david and goliath a variety of diminutive creatures 
overshadowed the great dinosaurs for a time 
after the dinosaurs evolved into a new line of giants again 
eclipsing small animals the same scenario apparently was played 
out about 65 million years later at the end of the cretaceous 
period when another catastrophe of some kind killed off all 
dinosaurs 
new species unearthed at the site include a 20pound herbivorous 
dinosaur a pair of fierce rodentlike mammals weighing less than a 
pound each and a neurologically sophisticated turtle bakker said 
numerous crocodilian remains also were found he said 
the sudden appearance of zofiabaatar a 6ounce furry meateater 
that bakker nicknamed the mutant ninja chipmunk illustrates 
small mammals were taking evolutionary advantage of the swampy 
environment during the crisis he said 
scientists have long been puzzled by the mass extinctions at the 
end of the jurassic period and theories focus on such factors as 
movements of the earth starvation parasites poisons changes in 
climate and meteorites 
but according to bakker dinosaurs became extinct because of 
worldwide diseases that turned into an epidemiological 
nightmare 
dinosaurs didnt go out with a bang they went out with 
worldwide diarrhea he said 
big animals travel and are extremely vulnerable to disease 
bakker said as land bridges formed throughout the globe the 
animals spread hundreds of diseases throughout all continents 
eventually killing the lot 
if youre a species one of the most dangerous things you can 
do is to invade a continent or have a foreign species move in he 
said so the stayathomes have an automatic immunity to this 
tourist trap of exotic disease 
the newly identified creatures apparently thrived in the swampy 
fernchoked environment that marked the end of the jurassic and the 
beginning of the cretaceous periods bakker said 
since fernchoked swamps also were present at the end of the 
cretaceous and during times of other mass dieoffs they may help 
explain why dinosaurs and other large land animals suffered 
repeated extinctions 
scientists studying mass extinction are like criminologists 
tracking a serial killer the clues that finally catch the killer 
usually come from the repeated pattern in the way the crimes were 
committed bakker said

legislators from 42 nations disagreeing with 
president bush say the time is now for specific moves to reduce 
the pollution that is causing global warming 
an international conference of lawmakers on the environment 
concluded wednesday with a call for specific curbs in socalled 
greenhouse gases and development of a global marshall plan 
to help developing countries deal with environmental problems 
this conference has given us an agenda for action said 
james miruka owuor a conference cochairman from kenya the 
threeday legislative gathering was hosted by the us congress 
the conference goals and resolutions are not binding on any 
country but they are expected to be used by environmental 
activists in legislative bodies as a way to push for new laws to 
deal with international environmental problems participants said 
some 200 lawmakers from the 42 nations including the soviet 
union most european countries japan and many developing nations 
took part in the conference 
we have come to a consensus agreement that the need for action 
is now that the need for action is urgent said sen albert 
gore dtenn the conference chairman 
delegates to the interparliamentary conference on the global 
environment called for 
nations to make a specific commitment for a 50 percent 
reduction in globalwarming gases over the next 20 years including 
elimination of the use of ozonedepleting chlorofluorocarbons or 
cfcs and a 20 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions largely 
from the burning of fossil fuels 
development of a socalled global marshall plan by 
industrial nations to help developing countries deal with 
international environmental problems such as global warming ozone 
deterioration loss of forests and other matters 
greater efforts to deal with population growth so that the 
worlds population could be stabilized at 10 billion people in the 
next century the link between population growth and environmental 
deterioration must be acknowledged the delegates said 
the policy statements and goals provided few specifics on where 
the money would come to pay for the new programs 
some delegates suggested that money from the peace dividend 
derived from improved eastwest relations be used to combat 
environmental problems 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee and a conference delegate called the 
conferences closing declaration an extraordinary statement of 
potential legislative strategies 
but dingell whose committee would act on most globalwarming 
legislation said he doubted any such bills would be approved this 
year 
nevertheless the aggressive strategies outlined by the 
legislators contrasted with the more cautious approach for dealing 
with environmental problems favored by the bush administration 
for example the president told an international white house 
conference on the environment two weeks ago that more research was 
needed before any commitments are made for specific pollution 
controls on global warming 
i think this is a message to the executive branch here in the 
united states and in other countries as well gore said of the 
resolutions approved by the legislators for any prime minister 
or president who says delay we are saying the time is now to 
act 
on global warming the conference agreed declaring delay 
exposes us our children and their children to calamities which we 
will have made irrevocable by inaction in the present 
the delegates called for setting a timetable for specific cuts 
in globalwarming pollutants by the year 2010 including a 20 
percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions a product of burning 
fossil fuels elimination of cfcs and a variety of other 
ozonedepleting chemicals and a 10 percent reduction in methane 
emissions 
altogether that would amount to about a 50 percent reduction in 
globalwarming pollutants by 2010 conference organizers said

that involves the massachusetts democrats private homosexual life 
after the committee ended its latest meeting wednesday without 
any announcement chairman julian c dixon dcalif said he was 
too hasty last week in predicting a decision was near 
he acknowledged it was difficult to interpret house rules in the 
frank case he did not immediately schedule a new meeting of the 
committee on standards of official conduct 
dixon wouldnt provide details on the roadblock but sources 
insisting on anonymity said some republican members are urging a 
united front that could withstand a promised challenge to their 
report on the house floor 
prevailing on the floor could require some tough language in a 
report on franks behavior even if theres no punishment 
the committee has declined to file charges of rulebreaking in 
recent investigations of house republican whip new gingrich of 
georgia and gus savage dill but it warned them not to repeat 
certain conduct 
rep william e dannemeyer a conservative california

would move on the floor to expel frank 
the committee is not expected to recommend a severe punishment 
for frank and based on past experience would not consider 
expulsion in a case like this 
they want to make sure all the bases are covered one source 
said of the republican members they dont want something that 
will be overturned 
rep louis stokes dohio who is sitting on the panel just for 
the frank case said everybodys aware of what he dannemeyer 
wants to do 
the panels ranking republican rep john t myers of indiana 
denied that the deliberations are partisan or that dannemeyers 
threat is driving the deliberations were still examining 
facts myers said 
he noted that while some preliminary votes broke down along 
partisan lines in a investigation of former speaker jim wright last 
year the final decision to charge wright with breaking the rules 
was unanimous wright resigned before the committee made its 
recommendations to the house 
dixon also denied there was any anger among committee members 
saying all the colleagues are in good spirit and theres no 
cantankerous attitude in there

operate a prostitution ring out of franks capitol hill apartment 
that the two men had sex in the house gymnasium and that frank 
invoked congressional privilege to waive parking tickets incurred 
by gobie while using franks car to keep appointments for illicit 
sex 
frank denied each of those allegations he said he paid gobie 
80 for sex in 1985 then hired him as a housekeeper and driver in 
hopes of reforming the prostitutes life frank said he fired gobie 
in august 1987 after learning of gobies prostitution operation 
from the lawmakers residence

selling sex from his apartment and contended there was no basis 
whatsoever to the story about sex in the house gym he said he 
did ask that parking tickets be waived when the car was used for 
official business

good evening tonights forecast 
calls for a 40 percent chance of rain and a 10 percent chance of a 
big earthquake 
californians may be tuning into such bulletins soon as 
seismologists put their computer models to work to issue warnings 
after ominous rattles of the earth 
the seismologists have gathered enough data on major fault 
systems in california to be able to predict to some degree the 
probability of a quake of 65 or more on the richter scale within 
certain brief periods 
after a foreshock of magnitude of 40 or greater is registered 
the model will go into work determining whether there is say a 
5 10 or 25 percent chance of a quake within the next three days 
the developers of the model are ready to put it into use but are 
discussing with the state how the predictions will be used 
whether they will be released publicly as earthquake warnings or 
provided to state agencies so they can prepare 
the model is a mathematical formula that uses data on fault 
activity and the probability of major shocks lucile m jones of 
the us geological survey said at a meeting wednesday of the 
seismological society of america 
seismologists long have known that big quakes generally are 
preceded by less powerful shocks but the new system is more 
precise jones said 
jones said a study of the major faults in california indicates 
for example that in the relatively quiet carrizo plain southwest 
of fresno the chance that a 5magnitude quake will be a foreshock 
to an 8magnitude quake is 24 percent 
jones who developed the formula with duncan c agnew of the 
university of californiasan diego said scientists will probably 
never be able to predict with absolute certainty but the 
percentages she can deliver are enough to let people take action to 
prevent damage or injury jones said 
as scientists we feel that sharing information is always 
better than withholding information she said 
the state could use the information to cancel vacations for 
disaster personnel jones said fire stations could move trucks 
outside daycare centers could leave gates unlocked in case they 
need to evacuate quickly residents could fill bathtubs with water 
for drinking put away dishes and prepare emergency supplies 
each individual group can start making those sorts of 
decisions she said we arent at a really high level of 
accuracy but people have been trying to get us to make these 
statements because there are useful things to do and as we get 
better the probabilities are going to head up 
geologist jim davis of the california division of mines and 
geology said he is talking with the office of emergency services 
about whether the agency should announce earthquake warnings davis 
said he didnt think quake forecasts would unduly alarm people or 
otherwise cause harm 
the prediction system has been worked out so far only for 
california whose seismic activity has been closely studied by 
scientists

a house panel intends to offer convicted junk 
bond financier michael milken immunity from prosecution for 
testimony he previously refused to give 
the energy and commerce oversight and investigations 
subcommittee voted unanimously wednesday to subpoena milken who 
pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay 600 million in 
penalties last week 
if milken receives immunity from the panel nothing he says at a 
congressional hearing could be used against him in court 
before milken is called to testify before congress something 
he refused to do two years ago the subpoena must be approved by 
the full energy and commerce committee 
milken once head of drexel burnham lambert incs highrisk 
highyield bond department faces up to 28 years in prison when he 
is sentenced in new york on oct 1 
in settling civil and criminal charges with the securities and 
exchange commission and the justice department milken agreed to 
testify truthfully before grand juries and at trials or court 
proceedings stemming from any drexelrelated activities 
if milken fails to comply with those rules he can be prosecuted 
for perjury and obstruction of justice and jailed for contempt of 
court under the settlement the agreements do not specifically 
mention congressional testimony 
a spokesman for milken in new york declined to comment on the 
subcommittee vote 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of both the full committee 
and subcommittee announced last week that he intended to recall 
milken as a witness now that his fouryear battle with the 
government is drawing to a close 
dingell wants to know about some 400 limited partnerships 
controlled largely by drexel employees that bought significant 
stakes in junk bond issues underwritten by drexel before they were 
made available to the public 
critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at 
the expense of drexel customers but the transactions legality has 
never been resolved 
milken was called to testify before the subcommittee in 1988 but 
invoked his fifth amendment right against possible 
selfincrimination 
a subpoena also was authorized at that time for convicted stock 
speculator ivan f boesky who was linked to milken in a number of 
illegal deals 
it had been served but the subcommittee was holding off on it 
until the disposition of the milken to see whether boesky would 
testify at a milken trial said the congressional aide who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
boesky settled sec insidertrading charges by pleading guilty to 
one felony count and paying 100 million in fines and restitution 
he was freed last month after serving two years of a threeyear 
prison sentence

senate democratic leaders plan to make public 
financing of senate campaigns a major portion of a revised election 
financing package congressional sources say 
one of the sources said the senate leadership plan scheduled to 
be unveiled today would include full public financing of senate 
general elections for candidates who agree to voluntary spending 
limits 
another source said public financing was a centerpiece of the 
democratic plan but declined to give details both sources spoke 
wednesday on the condition of anonymity 
a spokesman for sen john f kerry dmass the sponsor of 
legislation creating public financing of senate campaigns declined 
comment when asked if kerrys proposal had been accepted by the 
democratic leadership 
the spokesman larry carpman referred all questions to the 
office of senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
mitchell spokeswoman diane dewhurst also refused to comment 
we will have an announcement of the democratic package 
thursday afternoon she said that proposal will be the 
starting point for the floor debate and more importantly for 
negotiations with the chambers republican leaders 
mitchell said earlier in the week that democratic support for 
some kind of public financing was growing but would not discuss 
specifics of the revised democratic plan 
the senate floor debate would could begin this week will open 
with democrats and republicans offering starkly different plans 
the gop floor leader kentucky sen mitch mcconnell unveiled a 
republican plan tuesday that would ban all political action 
committee contributions 
many in the democratic majority oppose an outright ban on pacs 
whose donations tend to favor incumbents 
republicans have opposed public financing and the spending 
limits espoused by mitchell and sen david boren dokla 
past proposals brought to the floor have shied away from public 
financing which under the kerry plan would be paid for by 
increasing the voluntary checkoff on tax returns from 1 to 3 
there remains considerable opposition to public financing in 
both parties but public interest groups seeking campaign finance 
reform have said its inclusion in the initial democratic bill at 
least would help their position in the negotiations 
other incentives for accepting spending limits expected in the 
democratic plan include reduced broadcast and mailing rates public 
financing of general elections would leave the door open for pac 
involvement in primaries and the democrats are expected to propose 
a limit on pac spending in those races

mayor marion barrys attorney says prosecutors 
jeopardized the mayors health and went too far in supplying crack 
cocaine the night he was arrested on a drug charge 
attorney r kenneth mundy in a motion filed in us district 
court said the eightcount drug possession and perjury case 
against barry should be dropped because prosecutors allowed the 
mayor to use drugs before arresting him 
mundy accused the government of prosecutorial overreach for 
supplying the crack cocaine and cocaine pipe barry used 
this overinvolvement is unprecedented mundy wrote in the 
motion released wednesday there appears to be no case in which 
such elaborate and dangerous preparations were employed to prove 
that a suspect was a mere user 
in earlier filings us attorney jay b stephens argued that 
prosecutors routinely provide illegal drugs to suspects in 
undercover drug buys 
mundy had complained that the governments action had been 
coercive but stephens cited a supreme court ruling that such 
procedures were commonly used in contraband offenses which are 
so difficult to detect in the absence of undercover government 
involvement 
stephens also argued in the earlier filing that to require the 
agent to interrupt the use of the controlled substance likely would 
compromise the investigation 
but mundy noting that medical technicians were present to 
examine the mayor after he used the cocaine argued that the 
government acted illegally in allowing the mayor to smoke the 
cocaine 
the fact that the medical technicians were available does not 
make the governments conduct any less offensive mundy said 
it only corroborates the fact that they knew the plan was 
potentially lifethreatening 
mundy concluded by referring to previous cases which were 
dismissed because prosecutors used coercion violence or 
brutality 
stephens has until monday to file a response to mundys pleading 
barry 54 faces five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges and 
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug use 
the trial is scheduled to start june 4 
one of the possession charges stems from his jan 18 arrest in 
the undercover fbi sting operation while the other four possession 
charges and the perjury counts come from a 16month probe into 
barrys ties to a convicted drug dealer 
meanwhile the executive committee of the district of columbia 
democratic state committee was expected to present a resolution 
today to the full committee asking barry not to seek reelection 
this year wttgtv reported wednesday 
the resolution urged barry to consider the best interests of 
the citizens and not seek renomination in 1990 according 
to the television station 
the mayor who aides said intends to run for reelection in 
november went through seven weeks of substance abuse treatment 
following his arrest 
barry has said he was suffering from alcoholism but top aides 
said he had a cocaine problem as well barry has not yet publicly 
revealed his reelection plans 
if convicted of a felony barry would be barred from holding 
office or running for reelection

a federal appeals court reversed a judge and 
upheld the states death penalty law opening the way for illinois 
first execution in 28 years 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals in a 30 decision on 
wednesday overturned a ruling last year that the 1977 capital 
punishment law gives prosecutors too much leeway in whether to seek 
the death penalty 
the ruling came in the case of charles silagy convicted of the 
1980 murders of his girlfriend and another woman he is one of 124 
inmates on death row in illinois no one has been executed in the 
state since 1962 
on monday the us supreme court cleared the way for the 
execution of charles walker by ruling that five people who 
challenged his death sentence without his support had no standing 
in the case 
walker condemned in 1983 after pleading guilty to killing two 
people is closest to being executed of the states deathrow 
inmates walker has said he wants to die and has abandoned all 
appeals 
no execution date has been set but corrections officials said 
it could come within 60 to 90 days silagys execution could come 
this year as well said attorney general neil hartigan 
hartigan called the silagy ruling a very substantial victory 
for the people of illinois 
jay miller executive director of the illinois chapter of the 
american civil liberties union said his organization was unhappy 
with both rulings 
we believe its past the time when the united states should 
have a death penalty miller said were left with the soviet 
union and south africa among western nations having the death 
penalty 
wednesdays ruling reversed the decision of us district judge 
harold baker who found the death penalty law unconstitutional 
under the law illinois prosecutors can wait until after a 
conviction to say whether they will seek the death penalty 
silagys lawyers had argued their handling of the case was hampered 
by not knowing what prosecutors would do 
but the appeals court rejected bakers contention that illinois 
law allowed prosecutors to be arbitrary and capricious or 
hindered defense attorneys 
in fact the court said illinois law may even enhance the 
quality of prosecutorial decisions by permitting the prosecutor 
to weigh all of the evidence in his assessment of the 
propriety of seeking the death penalty

drug enforcement chief terrence m burke says 
his agency was not involved in the kidnapping of a mexican doctor 
sent to the united states to face charges in the murder of a drug 
agent 
we did not have any agent actively participate in the planning 
and execution of the operation the acting head of the drug 
enforcement administration told a senate hearing wednesday 
humberto alvarez machain was abducted from his guadalajara 
office on april 2 and flown by private jet to el paso texas there 
he was arrested for allegedly participating in the 1985 
torturekilling of dea agent enrique camerena 
mexicos government has strongly protested the way alvarez 
machain was captured and has demanded the extradition of anyone 
involved president carlos salinas de gortari complained to vice 
president dan quayle last week in mexico city and quayle told him 
no american agents were involved 
the dea has placed a high priority on capturing those suspected 
of involvement in camarenas killing american authorities believe 
alvarez machain monitored camarenas condition during the torture 
salinas speaking at the associated press annual luncheon april 
23 in los angeles said the seizure of alvarez machain could 
jeopardize the war against drugs 
this runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who 
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem 
much larger than the one we are trying to combat he said 
but burke told the senate appropriations committee we broke 
no united states law that im aware of the panel fashions the 
justice departments money bill 
senators noted published reports that a former mexican police 
official has been on the dea payroll and may have participated in 
planning the alvarez machain abduction they did not press burke on 
the point 
four men claiming to be mexican federal police seized the 
gynecologist on april 2 mexican authorities said saturday that a 
former mexican policeman arrested in connection with the abduction 
said he was told it was a dea operation 
burke said he met with mexican officials last week and assured 
them american agents did not take part in the operation 
a long line of us court decisions have held that a fugitive 
can stand trial in the united states even if the arrest overseas 
was improper or illegal

oregon officials have unveiled a list 
ranking the worthiness of some 3000 medical procedures the first 
step in an unprecedented attempt to ration government health care 
to the poor 
the computerized list of medical treatments ranked according to 
a formula that balances costs against how many people benefit will 
be studied and revised by the oregon health care commission in 
coming weeks 
the legislature will then draw a line across the list below 
that line the state wont pay for treating ailments 
the program approved by the legislature in 1989 is the first 
in the nation to consider eliminating expensive treatments for 
medicaid patients instead of providing total care as oregon and 
most other states do 
if approved by the federal government the program would add an 
estimated 77000 oregonians to medicaid rolls that now number about 
130000 
the 167page list was compiled by the commission staff and a 
consulting firm which held 11 public hearings 50 community 
meetings and a telephone survey to find out which illnesses 
oregonians considered most critical 
near the bottom of the tentative list released wednesday and 
likely to be dropped from coverage were treatments for dementia 
skin problems impacted teeth and sexchange operations 
detection and prevention of aids is high on the list but 
treatment for aids when a patient is close to death is near the 
bottom so are liver and bone marrow transplants which can run 
into the hundreds of thousands of dollars 
thumb sucking was 37th ahead of croup and congenital syphilis 
thats because common ailments like thumb sucking are easily 
treated at a relatively low cost 
malocclusion crooked teeth fell between two treatments for 
hodgkins disease a lymphatic disorder that is fatal if left 
untreated 
thats an orthodontic problem i mean give me a break 
said dr harvey klevit chief of pediatrics and assistant regional 
medical director of the kaiser permanente health care system 
health commission officials said there were many errors on the 
list which was tentative and partial 
under the medicaid system in oregon and much of the rest of the 
country the number of poor people who are eligible depends on the 
amount of money available to treat them 
when money gets tight the state rewrites its eligibility 
requirements and more relatively welloff people are removed from 
the list those who are left enjoy a relatively rich package of 
benefits 
under the new plan there would be no limit on the number of 
people who could receive basic medicaid benefits but patients 
would be out of luck if their ailments didnt quality 
the document contained so many errors that the panel considered 
withholding it it decided to release it only on condition it not 
be considered final 
its a ponderous complicated almost overwhelming collection 
of data said commission chairman bill gregory but we had to 
start somewhere

the house has voted to authorize the

investment in the 74 billion project 
the bill approved 309109 wednesday allows the department of 
energy to build the particle accelerator near waxahachie texas 
costs above 5 billion would be left to texas which has pledged 
1 billion and other sources including foreign investors 
house members by a 256163 vote approved an amendment calling 
for the us government to return texas investment if the energy 
department cancels the project before october 1995 
rep dennis eckart dohio said the vote did not assure 
congress would fully fund the project spending will have to be 
approved later during congress annual appropriations process 
the bill was sent to the senate but the supercollider will not 
likely be authorized by the full chamber an aide to sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas said senators probably will act on the collider 
during appropriations 
the supercollider is a 54mile underground ring in which streams 
of protons guided by electromagnets would be hurled at almost the 
speed of light until they smash together and break into even 
smaller particles 
scientists say the supercollider would recreate the physical 
state in the moment after the big bang which some believe was the

bush administration officials say a plan to 
link federal employees pay to performance would provide extra 
compensation for workers who live in new york los angeles and san 
francisco 
the proposal also would let the government ignore salary caps 
for hiring 400 world class experts for such fields as nuclear 
safety and medical research constance newman director of the 
office of personnel management said wednesday in releasing the 
administrations pay proposal 
were having trouble recruiting and retaining people to run 
this government newman said of the plan which would affect 
about 14 million whitecollar workers 
congress in the past has rejected similar payforperformance 
proposals but ms newman said lawmakers are beginning to realize 
the governments inability to compete with private industry 
the plan was introduced in both the house and the senate this 
week 
unions representing federal employees criticized the proposal 
last month saying government pay cannot be reformed without 
additional money 
the opms plan which provides an additional 15 billion for 
the 1991 fiscal year would award raises based on performance 
rather than tenure 
in addition the opm which handles personnel matters for the 
federal bureaucracy is asking for congressional authority to 
eliminate the system that awards annual pay increases 
the administrations plan calls for providing geographic 
differentials to employees in certain cities where the federal 
government has the most trouble competing with private industry

a nationwide radio broadcast and public 
meetings across the united states set in motion a campaign to 
upgrade the nations deteriorating infrastructure with money saved 
from the end of the cold war 
the time has come to convert the militarydriven us economy to 
a civilian economy worthy of a firstclass industrial nation 
sponsor said wednesday 
the national commission for economic conversion and disarmament 
the overall sponsor said its call to spend the peace dividend 
on rebuilding america was voiced at simultaneous town meetings in 
more than 60 cities wednesday night 
the broadcast over more than 30 radio stations was followed by 
two hours of callin discussion 
seymour melman chairman of the private advocacy group urged 
communities faced with the loss of military bases or defense 
industries to initiate new activity he said planning to repair 
roads bridges schools railways and other deteriorating 
infrastructure should come from the local level 
the effort is gaining momentum and allies including the us 
conference of mayors said melman a retired columbia university 
industrial engineering professor 
melman has said that by the end of the 1970s the united states 
was no longer a firstclass industrial economy because it invested 
a smaller proportion of its gross national product in its civilian 
economy than did european countries or japan

those broadcasting from washington or calling in endorsements 
included new york city mayor david dinkins philadelphia mayor

residents of this vanishing town 
struggled to hold on to prized possessions as lava from kilauea 
volcano flowed on 
lovenia kamelamela who lives in the home built by her 
greatgrandfather in 1886 on hawaiian homestead land worried about 
her coconut trees she hoped to to remove as many trees as possible 
before she is ordered to evacuate today 
at the heart of the coastal town the kalapana store and 
drivein owner walter yamaguchi has vowed to stay open even though 
hawaii county civil defense authorities plan to erect a roadblock 
to keep people away from the store the volcano six miles away 
has spewed lava to within 250 yards of the store 
this is my property i can open if i want yamaguchi said 
i am not moving because she will stop 
three homes were destroyed wednesday and five tuesday bringing 
to 129 the number burned down since kilauea began erupting in 
january 1983 
more than 50 were destroyed in the past month in this community 
alone where 125 homes once stood only 30 remain others burned 
along the path to kalapana about a dozen families were to evacuate 
this afternoon 
workers got ready to pick up and move the star of the sea 
church the roman catholic painted church so called because of 
the brightly colored murals inside sits in the direct path of the 
lava 350 yards away 
across the street the kalapana mauna kea congregational church 
awaited its fate the church originally built in 1823 was 
destroyed by an earthquake lava flow and tidal wave in 1868 
another quake forced the rebuilding of the church at its present 
site in 1935 
if god wants to save it he will deacon ed kahanu said 
its his church he can do what he wants 
some people attribute the lava flow to the volcano goddess pele 
of hawaiian folklore 
most kamaainas nativeborn or longtime residents of hawaii do 
not substitute the worship of pele for religion but use it as a way 
to show appreciation for the beauty around them 
its more a respect for the land and the volcano than a 
religion said reggie okamura of the us geological surveys 
national volcano observatory i have some belief its inherent 
to anyone born and raised here 
even gov john waihee who toured the area tuesday said the 
fate of kalapana is in peles hands nobody can tell madame pele 
when it all ends the governor said nobody can tell her what 
to do 
ed lorenz has lived in the shadow of kilauea volcano most of his 
60 years a true believer in the power of pele he said she is as 
angry as hes ever seen 
if she wasnt mad she wouldnt damage any houses lorenz 
said ive seen a lot of flows but this is one of the worst

former hostages who had not wanted or been able to speak at length 
during their captivity

the first parkinsons disease patient in the 
united states to be treated with transplanted brain tissue from an 
aborted fetus said the operation has made it easier for him to talk 
and move about 
and a researcher who wrote a paper on the case said wednesday 
the transplant could benefit many parkinsons sufferers 
the bush administration has banned use of federal funds for 
medical research involving fetal tissue which abortion opponents 
say creates an incentive for abortion don nelsons operation was 
paid for privately 
im walking better i dont use crutches or a cane any more 
when im walking in the house nelson 53 said in a telephone 
interview from the denver area my speech has improved the 
volume of my voice is better 
nelson said he probably has 30 percent to 35 percent more 
ability to move than before the operation 1 years ago but he 
still has spells of freezing when he is virtually unable to 
walk 
im hoping that ill continue to get better he said 
nelson also has regained normal functioning of his hands said 
dr curt r freed professor of medicine and pharmacology at the 
university of colorado health sciences center 
the november 1988 operation was the first on a parkinsons 
victim in the united states according to freeds report in the may 
issue of archives of neurology a publication of the american 
medical association 
i think its very exciting to be able to take a chronic 
disease of the nervous system and reverse aspects of it 
freed said in a telephone interview 
parkinsons disease afflicting an estimated 500000 americans 
develops when areas of the brain degenerate and stop producing 
dopamine a brain chemical essential for normal muscle movements 
experiments with rats and monkeys have shown that fetal cells 
transplanted into adult brains can grow and produce dopamine 
about 40 operations on humans have been performed worldwide 
including some others in the united states since nelsons freed 
said 
a patient in sweden improved markedly five months after an 
operation there according to the february issue of science 
magazine 
in nelsons operation tissue from the part of the brain that 
produces dopamine was transplanted from a 7weekold aborted fetus 
into the right side of nelsons brain a needle was used to make 10 
tiny injections with the total fetal material amounting to about 
a sixth of a drop freed said 
eugene redmond jr a yale school of medicine psychiatry 
professor has said that fetal cell implant therapy could become 
the best hope for many people but he has cautioned that a 
study of a single patient cannot yield final conclusions

of a mexican doctor charged in the slaying of a us drug agent 
mexican attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said 
wednesday that extradition papers are being prepared for antonio 
garate bustamante a selfdescribed drug enforcement agency 
informant who claims to have organized the abduction of dr

of us drug agent enrique camarena prosecutors say he gave 
camarena drugs to revive him for additional torture before his 
slaying

bidding of dea agents has strained relations between the two 
countries mexico has threatened to stop cooperating in the fight 
against drug trafficking

castillo on wednesday before a conference of borderstate attorneys 
general 
thornburgh refused to say whether alvarez del castillo had asked 
for garates extradition he said such requests would be made 
through the us state department garate lives in los angeles

during a may 25 federal court hearing in los angeles thornburgh 
said

machain was kidnapped nor until he was arrested in el paso texas 
alvarez del castillos spokesdman fernando arias perez said 
mexico wants an agreement that would allow mexican drug agents to 
operate in the united states the same way dea agents work in 
mexico he said there are 41 dea agents in mexico 
a us law enforcement source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said thornburgh had serious misgivings about such a 
proposal 
garate a former mexican police officer told the los angeles 
times last week that the dea promised 10 mexicans 100000 for 
alvarez machains capture in guadalajara and delivery to el paso

crime boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo 
was sentenced to life in prison for ordering a 1985 hit of a 
lowlevel mob figure who did not show him enough respect 
im concerned about the people who follow your direction 
common pleas court judge eugene clark told scarfo at the sentencing 
wednesday you have made a great part of your life establishing 
fear in people and you have destroyed many lives 
scarfo 61 was convicted of firstdegree murder in the july 
1985 slaying of frank frankie flowers dalfonso on a south 
philadelphia street 
dalfonso was a lowlevel mob figure killed because he did not 
show proper respect to scarfo and didnt give the mob a large 
enough share of a gambling operation prosecution witnesses said 
the governments case was based on the testimony of two reputed 
mob figures thomas delgiorno who said he supervised the murder 
and eugene milano both got reduced sentences in exchange for their 
cooperation 
clark rejected a plea from scarfos lawyer robert simone to 
make the life sentence concurrent with sentences imposed for 
federal convictions 
the judge directed that the life term should run consecutive to 
scarfos first federal sentence 14 years for attempting to extort 
1 million from a philadelphia developer he added additional 
sentences totaling five to 15 years for conspiracy and weapons 
offenses 
scarfo also was convicted in november 1988 on federal

a drug company plans to seek approval to sell an 
experimental new medicine for alzheimers disease even though a 
canadian study released today suggests it does not work 
tetrahydrominoacridine or tha is intended to ease the symptoms 
of alzheimers disease the leading cause of senility among older 
americans 
comparison studies conducted on 39 patients fail to 
demonstrate a significant clinical benefit of tha even though 
some victims appeared initially to improve the canadian 
researchers concluded 
however at warnerlambert the pharmaceutical company that 
makes tha a spokesman said the research should have been limited 
to the minority of alzheimers patients who show an initial 
response to the medicine 
the study directed by dr serge gauthier of mcgill university 
in montreal was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
initially the doctors gave increasing doses to see how much of 
the medicine people could tolerate during this phase of the 
research some patients appeared to get somewhat better family 
members said their speech improved and they were able to do such 
simple tasks as answer the telephone or set the table 
during the next part of the research patients were randomly 
assigned to take tha or dummy placebos this time the apparent 
benefits did not return and there was no important difference 
between the two groups according to the study 
the researchers speculated that patients might have built up a 
resistance to the drug or that family members might have imagined 
the seeming early improvement 
at warnerlambert spokesman barry cohen said the company 
believes the drug is useful and plans to ask the us food and drug 
administration in june for permission to sell it under the brand 
name cognex 
the company estimates about 40 percent of alzheimers patients 
could benefit from the drug he said though it is not a cure 
cohen said the companys own study being conducted at us 
hospitals is encouraging but he did not disclose details of the 
findings

angry students tried to storm the auditorium 
during a speech by a professor who believes blacks are inferior 
and nine people were arrested and five police officers injured 
authorities said 
michael levin a philosophy professor at city college gave a 
speech wednesday at long island universitys brooklyn campus 
defending the argument that white fear of black crime is logical 
and morally correct said frank post an liu spokesman 
police formed a blockade at the auditoriums doors and kept the 
protesters from entering post said 
levin has written in academic journals that on average blacks 
are less intelligent than whites 
the difference in intelligence is inarguable the new york 
post quoted levin as saying theres good evidence that theres a 
significant genetic contribution to that alleged difference 
in his speech levin said whites have a right to be afraid of 
blacks thats reasonable he argued that police have a right to 
include blacks in suspect profiles used to make drug arrests 
because blacks are so largely involved in crime 
after levin had finished speaking one of the protesters outside 
yelled that levin should be removed from the campus post said 
of the nine who were arrested seven were charged with 
disorderly conduct one was charged with harassment and one was 
charged with riot and assaulting a police officer said police 
spokesman fred weiner 
the university whose student population is 70 percent black 
had considered revoking levins invitation to its urban ethics 
conference post said a panel of students faculty and 
administrators decided that in the interest of free speech and a 
free exchange of ideas on a university campus levin should be 
allowed to speak 
levin was escorted from the university unharmed

in the first phase of an effort to save 
a primitive indian tribe in the amazon jungle authorities blew up 
the first of more than 100 airstrips used by gold miners 
the miners have brought disease and death to the yanomami 
indians whose population dropped from 9000 to 7500 since the 
gold rush began three years ago 
more than 250 soldiers air force officials and federal police 
on wednesday blew up the first airstrip a 600yard runway in the 
tropical rain forest near the venezuelan and guyanan borders 
the military used 374 pounds of explosives to blast open 40 
holes each 13 feet in diameter and four feet deep said federal 
police spokesman joao martins 
the rest of the airstrips will be destroyed before may 18 to 
prevent the 40000 prospectors from returning to indian lands 
martins said in a telephone interview he said the work will cost 
800000 
president fernando collor de mello ordered the destruction of 
the airstrips following a visit to the yanomami reservation soon 
after he took office on march 15 
in addition to evacuating the miners who first invaded the 1 
millionacre reserve in 1987 collor promised to blow up the 
illegal landing strips to stop planes from supplying the miners and 
transporting gold and diamonds 
martins said tw airstrips will be left intact for the national 
indian foundation and the army which maintains border outposts in 
the region to combat drug trafficking and smuggling along brazils 
4000mile northern frontier 
he said troops seized one small plane loaded with cocaine on the 
airstrip just before the dynamiting operation began police say 
drug traffickers used the clandestine airstrips as transhipment 
points between colombia and bolivia 
the rush to yanomami territory began three years ago after 
government studies revealed the presence of gold diamonds tin and 
bauxite in the region 
prospectors flocked to the area leveling rain forests chasing 
off fish and game polluting rivers with mercury used in gold 
panning and spreading diseases previously unknown to the isolated 
tribe 
since 1987 the tribe has dwindled due to malnutrition venereal 
diseases and malaria others have been killed in clashes with 
miners 
under international pressure the government of former president 
jose sarney announced a 4 million campaign in early january to 
expel the prospectors by force if necessary 
there are about 220000 native indians left in brazil down from 
an estimated 5 million when the portuguese first landed here in 
1500 
the government has been steadily carving up indian lands 
leaving the yanomamis 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million 
acres in brazils northwest amazon territory

blacks hispanics and women cant be kept 
off juries as a group but its ok to exclude people whose last 
names begin with the letters w through z 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 30 wednesday that 
jurors at the end of alphabetical order do not constitute a 
recognizable and distinct class covered by court decisions 
barring discrimination in jury selection the claim was raised by a 
man whose last name begins with a w william jefferson walker 
he was convicted of aggravated assault and leaving the scene of 
an accident in pima county ariz in september 1983 and sentenced 
to 10 years in prison for reasons not explained by the court the 
pool from which the jury was chosen included no one with a surname 
starting with w through z 
walker cited a psychologists study published in 1970 that 
concluded people whose names started with letters from s to z were 
50 percent more likely than others to develop a condition called 
alphabetic neurosis 
the court noted that two other appeals courts have rejected 
similar claims one of them involving a jury made up entirely of 
people whose names began with the letters t through z

the administration of mayor kurt schmoke has 
reversed itself and approved a parade permit for a white 
supremacist skinhead group rather than face a threatened court 
challenge 
deputy city solicitor ambrose hartman said the city reluctantly 
approved the permit monday despite objections from community 
leaders after concluding it could not win should the group sue on 
the grounds that its right to free speech was being denied 
the group known as bash or baltimore area skin heads said it 
wants to protest the arrival of soviet jews in the united states 
and would march within a month 
the baltimore sun quoted an unidentified member of the group as 
saying the group selected a predominately white workingclass area 
of baltimore called hampden because it is one of the last white 
neighborhoods around the group wants marylanders to take a stand 
against racemixing and what they say are other threats to white 
power he said 
eleven churches community organizations and other hampden civic 
groups asked the city to deny the permit after learning of the 
planned rally last month 
referring to two wealthier baltimore neighborhoods the rev 
david rimbach pastor of the hampden united methodist church said 
theyre not going to parade though roland park or charles 
village they are going to parade through hampden because they 
think its a place of hate and violence 
we dont want to be painted with those kind of colors any 
more he said wednesday 
skinheads are known for their shaved heads heavy boots and nazi 
insignia they have been linked to racial and religious crime in 
more than two dozen states 
what we resent more than anything is it adds to the reputation 
for intolerance weve gotten over the years said edward r 
jeunette jr past president of the hampden community council he 
said it doesnt represent a majority view of the people who live 
here

to form the countrys first noncommunist government in more than 
40 years 
prime ministerdesignate jozsef antall the democratic forum 
leader said he hopes to name a government by midmay after 
concluding negotiations with several smaller political parties 
the democratic forum emerged as the strongest party in the newly 
elected parliament winning 164 of the 394 seats in free elections 
concluded april 8 
antall has already held coalition talks with the independent 
smallholders party with 44 seats and the christian democrats 
with 21 seats 
parliament was to appoint members of its committees before 
ending its largely ceremonial first session later today it is the 
first freely elected parliament to sit in budapest since the 
communists consolidated power in 1948 
goencz a writer who was jailed for six years after the 1956 
anticommunist uprising is a leading member of the league of free 
democrats the leading opposition party in the new parliament 
in nominating antall to form a new government goencz told the 
deputies i consider him the perfectly suitable person for this 
task 
the nomination was goenczs first task as interim president 
following his election wednesday as interim president goencz 
succeeds matyas szueros a reform communist who helped hungary make 
its gradual transition toward multiparty democracy 
antall accepted the nomination saying hungarians can now take 
our fate in our hands 
i will try to lead the country out of this difficult 
situation he said i ask you for your confidence so that we 
can use this historic opportunity 
antall said the country could move forward only if his 
government can gain the cooperation of the opposition free 
democrats the second largest party in parliament 
if he succeeds in building a centerright coalition with the 
smaller parties antall would be able to count on support from 229 
deputies that would give his government a simple majority in 
parliament but not the twothirds majority required to approve 
major constitutional changes 
the two leading parties did cooperate in selecting candidates 
for interim president and prime minister the democratic forum 
agreed to support goencz and the interim president in turn 
nominated antall 
antall said the democratic forum and free democrats had also 
agreed to amend the constitution so that the president would be 
elected to a regular fouryear term by the parliament rather than 
by a national election 
on wednesday goencz was elected speaker of parliament which 
automatically made him interim president 
goencz is expected to become president a largely ceremonial 
post by june after the new government is formed and the necessary 
constitutional amendments are enacted antall said 
the old communist government of prime minister miklos nemeth 
tendered its resignation wednesday but will stay on in a caretaker 
capacity until the new cabinet takes over 
in hungary reform communists cleared the path to democracy 
reorganized into a new socialist party and gradually liberalized 
the system over the past two years but hungarians showed their 
anger over decades of communist rule at the polls and the 
socialists won only 33 seats in the new parliament

secretary of state james a baker iii 
told nato allies today that the united states has scrapped plans to 
develop a more powerful lance shortrange nuclear missile for 
deployment in europe 
baker also said there would be no further modernization of 
nuclear artillery according to west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher 
in addition baker proposed that 35 foreign ministers from east 
and west meet in new york in late september to plan a summit 
meeting by the end of the year genscher said 
the objective would be the signing of a treaty to sharply reduce 
troops tanks artillery and other nonnuclear arms in europe nato 
foreign ministers took no direct action on the proposed meeting 
according to genscher baker raised the possibility that 
negotiations on reducing shortrange nuclear arms would begin 
immediately after completion of an accord slashing conventional or 
nonnuclear weapons in europe 
in recent weeks nato officials have questioned the need to 
upgrade shortrange missiles at the start of 1992 as agreed at a 
nato summit last spring in view of the sharply reduced military 
threat from the east 
also to be shelved are some 900 nonnuclear lance ii missiles 
all the shortrange weapons were to have been trained on east 
germany which is moving toward a swift merger with west germany a 
key nato member 
german unification and its impact on security in europe was to 
be the focus of todays nato meeting with members expected to 
reiterate calls for a reunified germanys membership in the 
alliance 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said on arrival that 
the issue of german unification was far more important today 
than quick action on upgrading the 700 aging nuclear lance missiles 
in europe 
the meeting in brussels comes two days before the beginning of 
talks in bonn west germany bringing together the foreign 
ministers of the world war ii allies the united states britain 
france and the soviet union and those of west and east germany to 
discuss the future of a united germany 
after his talks at the nato headquarters baker was due to head 
to the european community head office for a meeting with the 
communitys 12 foreign ministers 
the meeting at nato comes after some countries notably italy 
belgium the netherlands and canada expressed concern over being 
shut out of the german unification process although it affects them 
directly 
it is very good baker comes here now as the twoplusfour 
talks open two days later said a dutch official at nato 
this is wholly in line with our wishes and those of other 
allies 
other sources who also asked not to be named said countries 
outside the twoplusfour process see todays meeting as a way 
of maintaining natos role in building a new security order in 
europe 
the nato ministers were expected to restate their wish to see a 
united germany as member of the alliance 
the soviet union which has 380000 troops in east germany 
opposes such an arrangement it wants a neutral germany or a 
germany straddling the two military blocs 
also on the agenda of todays meeting were talks in vienna on 
reductions in conventional forces and arms in europe

the food and drug administration today 
approved the use of the drug azt to treat children with aids it is 
the only drug that has been shown to extend the lives of adults 
with the deadly disease 
new labeling on the drug outlines dosage recommendations for 
patients aged 6 months to 12 years who have the disease or show 
symptoms of advanced infection with the virus that causes it 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said the new 
labeling means the drug is now officially considered to be a 
standard therapy for children with aids he said the new status 
should encourage insurance companies to reimburse patients for 
pediatric use of the drug 
the fda has been under pressure to approve azt for treatment of 
children particularly from parents of stricken children who have 
no other recourse an advisory committee of outside experts voted 
71 on march 30 to recommend the new pediatric labeling 
while azt has prolonged the lives of people with aids it also 
has caused significant side effects the drug can inhibit the 
production of red blood cells and may reduce white blood cell 
counts to the point where doses must be discontinued to avoid 
infections 
the fda said doctors could have prescribed azt for children 
without formal approval but were reluctant to do so because of 
concerns that side effects might be more severe in children the 
agency said clinical trials involving more than 200 children 
indicate the side effects are similar to those experienced by 
adults 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen 
the chief victims of aids have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users a small percentage of cases are attributed 
to transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and 
spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of feb 28 1990 aids had been diagnosed in 124984 
americans of whom 61 percent or 77003 have died since june 1 
1981 according to the federal center for disease control no one 
is known to have recovered from aids

recently however its leaders have cautiously criticized the

officials at georgetown university hospital 
believe missing radioactive material taken from the hospital was 
sent back to the netherlands a spokeswoman said today 
the hospital had been trying to locate a crate containing a 
potentially fatal dose of radioactive iridium it believed was 
accidentally taken from the hospital 
but hospital spokeswoman carol fox said today that officials 
found some documents on wednesday that indicated the missing 
radioactive material was picked up by the manufacturer on april 20 
she said the paperwork indicated that the iridium had been sent 
back to the netherlands where it was supposed to have been returned 
the hospital will be in contact with the manufacturer and hopes 
to be able to confirm later today that the shipment is safe and on 
track king said 
the radioactive iridium was protected by a blue steeljacketed 
lead shield and is braced to keep it in the center of the crate 
assuming the source is still contained in the lead shield and 
still packaged inside the crate radiation exposure rates should be 
minimal said a hospital statement released wednesday if 
however the source has been removed from the shielding it 
presents a potentially serious possibly fatal risk to anyone who 
may handle it 
the hospital said earlier the iridium was believed taken by a 
courier on april 20 and a georgetown radiation control officer 
discovered what was believed to be a mistake 10 days later 
the hospital notified the nuclear regulatory commission that a 
search for the crate failed 
the square 18inch crate bears a shipping label to georgetown 
university hospital 
the label on the crate also reads caution radioactive 
handle carefully iridium 192 10 curies transportation index

a selfproclaimed sex priestess who bedded 
down with her followers says she first asked for proof in cash or 
other tokens of sacrifice that they viewed sex as a religious 
experience 
mary ellen tracy known to her flock as sabrina aset testified 
in federal court wednesday in her lawsuit accusing city officials 
of violating her religious freedom in pursuing prostitution charges 
against her 
mrs tracy and her husband wilbur have been convicted of 
prostitution and running a brothel 
assistant city attorney bryon r boeckman said the couple used 
their church of the most high goddess as a front for prostitution 
this is not a true religion boeckman said 
advertised in sexually explicit magazines the church boasted of 
services by a priestess wearing a strapless redsequined gown 
highheeled shoes and fishnet stockings 
the sparsely furnished church had no pews or pulpit the few 
wall hangings included posters of movie stars and a framed nude 
photograph of mrs tracy 
the couple claim divine inspiration prompted them to revive an 
ancient egyptian religion in which man justifies his sins by having 
sex with church priestesses 
ms tracy said initiates needed to confess and perform oral sex 
on her before they could be considered for purification before 
intercourse sacrifices of cash or other valuables were required to 
show dedication to the church she said 
its up to a person to decide if its an acceptable 
sacrifice she said during her criminal trial testimony 
included allegations she demanded at least 150 
she told judge william byrne on tuesday that she collected about 
50000 in donations in three years but kept no records on 
followers beyond their first names and telephone numbers 
the woman who claims to have had sex with thousands of men 
said she told followers their donations were tax deductible but no 
receipts were issued 
she acknowledged that about half the men paid only one visit to 
the church and never returned 
i dont think thats very unusual for any religion she said

president bush said today that he has invited 
congressional leaders to the white house on sunday to begin the 
search for a compromise on the 1991 federal budget 
what we have to do is start talking process and how we go 
forward the president said at a white house news conference 
im not going to sit here and do nothing 
after a slow start the house approved a 12 trillion budget 
tuesday for next year and the senate budget committee approved one 
of its own on wednesday both spending plans were written by 
democrats and impose cuts of about 10 billion in the defense 
programs bush wants 
the president said he decided to ask for the meeting because of 
the recent budget movement in congress 
now there seems to be more action so it seemed to me to be a 
good time to sit down and talk process and see where we go now 
he said 
bush denied that the meeting would be a bargaining session 
saying were not into a negotiation were talking process 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush will meet 
with sens george mitchell dmaine the majority leader bob dole 
rkan the minority leader house speaker thomas s foley and rep 
robert michel rill the house minority leader 
on capitol hill both liberal and conservative lawmakers are 
likely to challenge the senate budget committees decision to slash 
defense spending next year by 99 billion below the level bush 
wants 
the budget panel on wednesday adopted a democraticwritten 12 
trillion spending plan that sets defense spending at 2939 billion 
in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 in a year that has seen 
congressional democrats trying to reduce pentagon coffers that 
would be the deepest cut yet in bushs defense plans 
sen charles grassley of iowa was the only republican to join 
the panels majority democrats in the 149 vote for final passage 
democrats touted the plan which claims to shrink the deficit by 
43 billion as a response to the cold war thaw 
this is a clear shift in priorities a shift away from massive 
spending on defense and a greater concentration on the domestic 
needs of this country said committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn 
i dont believe its anywhere close to being right or prudent 
nor will it permit a proper builddown of our defenses countered 
sen pete domenici of new mexico the panels ranking republican 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said defense spending should be set at no less than 297 
billion 
these cuts are deeper than i believe can be justified by the 
changes in the threat nunn said 
on the other hand sasser said he expects liberal legislators to 
try to transfer money from defense to social programs when the full 
senate debates the budget probably within 10 days he said he 
would look sympathetically on such efforts 
bush has proposed spending 3038 billion for defense next year 
it would take 3069 billion to allow military programs to stay 
even with inflation this years spending is estimated at 2963 
billion 
the house approved its own democraticwritten budget on tuesday 
that cuts defense spending to 2955 billion 
besides saving 13 billion from defense the senate panels plan 
would chop 36 billion from domestic and foreign aid programs 
bush proposed only a 400 million cut 
sasser said that to achieve those savings he would recommend 
cutting eight to 10 programs including foreign aid the 
superconducting super collider and grants and loans to rehabilitate 
housing 
we have to think in terms of getting rid of the old to make 
room for the new sasser said 
the package also limits the growth of benefit programs by 56 
billion raises 62 billion in user fees and collects 139 
billion in new tax receipts the same figure bush proposed 
in opposing the plan republicans argued that the only way to 
reduce the deficit was for congressional leaders and the white 
house to hold negotiations the washington post today quoted a 
white house official as saying the president and congressional 
leaders planned to meet sunday to discuss the budget 
i believe were going to end up with minimal deficit reduction 
in spite of this budget unless there are major negotiating 
sessions with the president and the congressional leadership 
said domenici 
like most democrats sasser refused to commit himself to budget 
talks but he said the committeepassed plan could be a benchmark 
from which we would operate if there are talks 
the president does not have to sign the budget which lays out 
federal fiscal plans but his agreement will be needed for 
enactment of later spending and tax bills 
stephen hart a deputy white house press secretary said 
wednesday evening of the committees action we are not prepared 
to respond to specifics we still feel the presidents budget is 
the best proposal up there it will continue to be the basis of any 
discussions we have

conference 
 
bush let me just open with a statement and then ill be glad 
to take some questions 
the revolutionary changes transforming europe are moving us from 
the postwar era to a new era in history beyond containment the 
revolutions of 89 1989 that have brought democracy to eastern 
europe the prospect of german unification and my hope for rapid 
conclusion of a cfe agreement bring us close to a peaceful and more 
stable europe whole and free 
and ill be speaking tomorrow at commencement ceremonies in 
oklahoma state university about my conception of americas place in 
the new europe and i want to use this press conference today as an 
opportunity to highlight for you a few of the ideas i plan to 
discuss at greater length tomorrow 
we have arrived at this historic point by maintaining a strong 
partnership with our european allies nato will remain vital to 
americas place in europe it is a proven structure upon which to 
base our security and from which to promote a stable cooperative 
european order 
the alliance is now ready to take on new challenges and in 
order to set a new western strategy for these times and after 
consulting personally with my allied colleagues a consultation 
completed by secretary baker in brussels today i am calling for a 
nato summit in early in early summer late june or early july 
probably 
a fundamental purpose of this summit should be to launch a 
wideranging nato strategy review for the transformed europe of the 
1990s 
to provide direction for this i suggest that this summit should 
address first the future political mission of the alliance 
reaffirming its crucial role in managing and stabilizing the 
transformation of europe

african national congress leaders 
began a second day of talks with the government today and 
officials said both sides were committed to finding a way to bring 
blacks into the political process 
the whiteled government and the anc the countrys most 
powerful opposition group are seeking to clear the way for future 
negotiations on a constitution that would give the black majority 
the vote 
this first round of talks which opened wednesday are the first 
ever between the government and anc they are to end friday 
when all of us departed wednesdays talks the general 
feeling was that not only is movement forward necessary but that 
it is possible said thabo mbeki the head of the ancs foreign 
affairs department 
we had people sitting in that room who are perfectly 
reasonable and we are all committed to finding a solution mbeki 
told more than 200 people at the cape town press club 
anc spokesman patrick terror lekota wrote in an article 
published today in several newspapers black south africans have 
done every possible thing under the sun to get whites to negotiate 
a democratic constitution now it seems clear that we shall 
negotiate that kind of constitution in the near future 
following wednesdays talks the two sides issued a joint 
statement saying the discussions were characterized by openness 
and straightforwardness 
before opening the talks president fw de klerk and anc leader 
nelson mandela stood side by side and called for the swift 
abolition of apartheid 
in a bid to calm white fears about a black government mandela 
gave part of his statement in afrikaans the language of the 
dutchdescended afrikaners who make up 3 million of the countrys 5 
million whites and dominate the government 
de klerk said south africans of all races wanted rapid change 
all political parties must work together to find a peaceful 
solution to the countrys racial and political divisions he said 
under the apartheid system of racial segregation the countrys 
28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs while the 
whites control the government and the economy 
the anc says that before constitutional negotiations can begin 
the government must lift the state of emergency allow exiled 
activists to return and release activists convicted of politically 
motivated crimes 
the government wants the anc to renounce its largely ineffective 
armed struggle 
all these matters are on the agenda the two parties said 
the government has said that constitutional negotiations will 
include several opposition groups in addition to the anc 
however rightwing whites and radical black groups oppose any 
negotiated powersharing agreement between whites and blacks 
the proapartheid conservative party marched out of a debate in 
parliament on wednesday to protest the talks between the government 
and the anc the leader of the conservatives andries treurnicht 
said the government had no right to negotiate with an organization 
that has carried out guerrilla attacks and still was committed to 
an armed struggle 
meanwhile the militant pan africanist congress has accused the 
anc of appeasement for agreeing to meet with the government 
the pan africanists say the only matter they will negotiate is the 
direct transfer of power from whites to blacks 
de klerk has promised to end white rule but opposes a 
oneperson onevote system he says such a system would replace 
white domination with black domination 
the anc says it is committed to a full democratic system with no 
special rights for minorities the anc also wants a radical 
restructuring of the economy that could include government control 
of banks gold mines and other leading industries 
the talks are the first between a white government and an anc 
delegation since the organization was founded in 1912 the 
discussions are being held at the groote schuur estate once the 
official home of south african presidents

to enter the military like many small towns sheridan turns out 
for its yellowjackets on friday nights during football season 
even though many commute to jobs in little rock or pine bluff up 
to 30 miles away and the school has grown recently sheridan tries 
to stay strictly country 
obviously there have been changes over the last few years but 
this is not plano texas or germantown tenn hauhee said 
referring to other communities that have wrestled with cluster 
suicides 
still in case of another suicide a private jet was standing by 
to pick up a san franciscobased grief and trauma expert 
the community was tense as well as sad 
police and school officials dont suspect drug or alcohol 
problems had a role in the suicides all suicide victims had access 
to guns because this is a hunting community police chief david 
hooks said 
id like to find something like drugs to blame all the deaths 
on but i cant he said 
what authorities do suspect is that all three boys and a fourth 
classmate who took his life march 28 suffered from a lack of 
selfesteem 
school has to be more personal lives of children have to 
become paramount said sheridan schools superintendent david 
robinson we dont think were any different but we obviously 
have to make an effort to improve selfesteem 
tuesday night some 1200 parents turned out for a town meeting 
with school officials and suicide prevention experts 
at the high school wednesday morning first period was devoted 
to sessions that allowed teachers and students to discuss their 
feelings with assistance from some 60 mental health professionals 
and clergy who reviewed stages of grief and depression 
counselors and psychologists were placed in each classroom 
during the day and mingled throughout the school 
its still gloomy and its going to be that way for awhile 
said senior angela turley 18 
today school officials planned to cut back the number of 
counselors but keep some on call 
in the future counseling programs in the high school that had 
targeted drugs and alcohol may be shifted to deal with suicide 
robinson said student support groups also will be formed 
and sheridan once just a sawmill town but now a growing bedroom 
community with several new manufacturing plants an unemployment 
rate of only 32 percent and a high school dropout rate of just 3 
percent will pray it doesnt happen again 
im scared as a parent said hooks father of a 14yearold 
junior high school student 
at smiths funeral wednesday at the landmark baptist church the 
rev dennis moon urged 250 mourners to stop asking the 
unanswerable question of why the teenager killed himself 
bringing back tommy is beyond our control but going with him 
is still our choice moon said

president bush preparing to meet with the 
prime minister of lithuania said today he saw no role for the 
united states as a mediator in the conflict between the breakaway 
republic and the soviet union 
shortly before he was to meet at the white house with prime 
minister kazimiera prunskiene bush told a news conference that 
if there was a constructive role for the united states of 
course we should fulfill that but theres not 
the president also welcomed statements from lithuanian president 
vytautis landsbergis indicating a willingness to comprmise with the 
soviets 
meeting with members of the house foreign affairs commmittee and 
in a television appearance mrs prunskiene said lithuania is 
prepared for compromises in those negotiations but cannot and 
will not revoke our declaration of independence 
we also hope for international guarantees of this declaration 
of independence which we have made she said i wish to 
emphasize that we believe that only with these international 
guarantees the soviets will begin negotiations 
she said she hopes her talks with bush and senior us officials 
will expedite the process of a peaceful and useful resolution 
of lithuanias independence crisis 
bush declared that his desire for the freedom and 
selfdetermination of the lithuanians was just as strong as 
anybody elses 
theres a lot at stake in all of this he said there are 
complications in all of this poland eastern europe i want those 
soviet troops out and i want to see the firming up of the 
democracies in eastern europe and i want to see us keep this 
process going forward 
mrs prunskiene expanded on her call for guarantees in testimony 
for the commission on security and cooperation in europe the 
helsinki commission 
we could temporarily suspend the quick and unilateral 
execution of legislation implementing the independence 
declaration she said if there were international guarantees 
in no way does this mean a repeal of the acts or a 
renunciation of independence she said 
in such a case lithuania would have to be guaranteed on the 
basis of international law the continuity of lithuanian 
independence the continuation of her government and her 
territorial integrity she said 
rep dante fascell dfla the committee chairman said later 
that mrs prunskiene was closely questioned during a closed session 
of the breakfast meeting 
the guarantee she is seeking is the kind of international 
assurance that the rest of the world would not back away fascell 
said she wanted to be certain that internationally there is no 
change in support for what the lithuanians are trying to do 
fascell said i hope the soviets quickly respond im not 
happy with the appearance of doing business as usual at the summit 
while the screws are being put to the lithuanian people 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev have 
scheduled a summit meeting in washington may 30 
speaking hours before a scheduled meeting with bush she also 
said i dont necessarily have to hear any concrete suggestions 
from the president 
i think a solution is possible mrs prunskiene said on the 
nbc today show lithuania is ready for negotiations it is 
prepared for compromises and i think the time has come now for 
lithuania to define its position more clearly and to invite the 
kremlin once again to engage in negotiations 
it will be bushs first direct contact with a ranking lithuanian 
official since the baltic republic declared independence on march 
11 setting off a fierce tug of war with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
the talks with the president and other highranking us 
officials represent a symbolic foot in the white house door placed 
there in part by the demands of conservatives upset by bushs 
refusal to recognize lithuanian independence or retaliate against 
gorbachev for imposing a punishing trade embargo 
mrs prunskiene 47 an economist and former communist party 
official is described by many observers as a tough accomplished 
politician her oval office meeting with bush was being held in an 
atmosphere charged by the planned bushgorbachev summit 
the white house regards the prime ministers visit as 
unofficial spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush is not meeting 
with mrs prunskiene as prime minister of an independent lithuania 
but rather as an acknowledged and freely elected representative 
of the lithuanian people 
since the beginning of the crisis the administration has sought 
the opening of a dialogue between moscow and vilnius the 
lithuanian capital 
gorbachev has said a dialogue cannot occur until lithuania 
rescinds its independence declaration and moves to pursue its 
secession goals under the terms of the soviet constitution and law 
lithuanians maintain their independence is nonnegotiable and 
that to pursue it under soviet terms would be to accept the 
legitimacy of the forced incorporation of the country into the 
soviet union in 1940 
mrs prunskiene and lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
both have indicated a willingness to accept a proposal by the 
french and west german governments that they suspend laws passed to 
implement independence in exchange for talks and an easing of the 
soviet embargo

washn of europe 
 
second the alliances conventional defenses for the future and 
next steps for conventional arms control 
while were still in a period of transition as soviet forces 
leave eastern europe and our arms control works move forward we 
need to develop a new strategy for the period ahead 
and third the role of us nuclear forces in europe 
as democracy comes to eastern europe and soviet troops return 
home there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest range 
and in response to these new conditions i have decided to 
terminate the followon to lance program and cancel any further 
modernization of us nuclear artillery shells deployed in europe 
the nato summit should agree on broad objectives for future 
negotiations between the united states and the soviet union on the 
current shortrange nuclear missile forces in europe which should 
begin shortly after a cfe treaty has been signed 
fourth the future of the conference on security and cooperation 
in europe csce to give it and especially its eastern european 
member states a more active part in shaping europes future the 
csce can help to build free societies and provide a forum for 
political dialogue in a united europe 
my allied colleagues and i should agree to take up these these 
ideas at the csce summit this fall to be held around the signing 
of a cfe treaty 
the future of the united states cannot be separated from the 
future of europe and so along with our allies we must prepare for 
the magnificent opportunities that lie ahead 
in these times of uncertainty and hope nato will continue to be 
vital to americas place in europe and a bulwark of democratic 
values and security 
so this is what ill be talking about tomorrow and it has been 
discussed by jim baker with our allies in brussels yesterday and 
today 
and i dont know who has the first question but helen 
 
q mr president you said that things were moving on the 
hostage front and can i ask you what are the prospects of getting 
all the hostages out they may sometimes feel like sacrificial 
lambs as the us stands and waits what goodwill gesture do you 
have in mind to facilitate this and expedite their release 
a i would have in mind any gesture that wouldnt be perceived 
as negotiating for the release of hostages we have a policy i am 
going to stay with that policy but let me give you an example 
helen 
one of the things that the iranians are interested in is the 
fate of i believe it was four four iranians that were taken i 
think back in 82 now if theres some way that we can go back 
and get any information that would relieve the anxieties of the 
loved ones of those four people we ought to do that 
and it is our view and i have said this told made this 
clear that it is the best information we have that these people 
are not alive 
but just as we would like a full accounting for higgins our 
heroic marine that apparently has been killed i can understand the 
iranians wanting a full accounting even though they know we have 
nothing to do with this 
so heres an area where they have said theyd like some 
information and if we can get it i think we ought to get it and 
were trying so if that is goodwill so be it i hope it is its 
the way i would intend it and there may be other things we can do 
but look i understand the anxiety of the hostage families and 
i can understand the broken hearts and thats why im not going to 
shift

latvias legislature opened a session 
today to begin discussing whether to join baltic neighbors 
lithuania and estonia in asserting its independence from moscow 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis attended the opening 
session to be with my brothers and pro and antiindependence 
protesters stood aside as the deputies entered the parliament 
building 
about 50 soviet army officers who live in latvia gathered with 
signs proclaiming the people and the army are united and we 
wont go the way of lithuania 
a few steps away proindependence protesters carried banners 
saying the soviet army must go home and independence for 
latvia protesters carried soviet flags or the redandwhite 
latvian flag 
the legislature or supreme soviet discussed procedural 
questions and a vote on independence was likely friday deputies 
from the proindependence peoples front said they believe they can 
muster the needed twothirds majority 
the soviet news agency tass said the peoples front and its 
supporters had 131 of 201 seats in the legislature a twothirds 
majority would require 135 votes and peoples front activists 
believe they can find the extra votes 
anatoly gorbunov latvias president backed independence in a 
speech after being nominated to a new term 
i believe that the renewal of a legally sovereign nation must 
be accomplished he said declaring it a normal way of life for 
all the residents of latvia gorbunov was expected to win 
election to continue as president 
but he said the republic could not expect help from the west 
the world on account of 5 million baltic people is not going to 
risk what has been done in the area of arms control and by mikhail 
gorbachev he said 
landsbergis told latvian radio in an interview i see and feel 
that latvia wont retreat from the principle of independence 
he told the latvian deputies to be strong and have courage 
in his own republic officials of landsbergis government said 
today that shortages were beginning to touch medical supplies 
lithuania declared independence from the soviet union on march 
11 in response the kremlin imposed harsh economic sanctions 
including a sharp reduction in oil and gas supplies about two 
weeks ago 
the republic of 38 million people has been struggling 
economically ever since the embargo was imposed with plant 
closings forcing thousands to stop work and food and fuel being 
rationed 
a similar independence measue was adopted march 30 by estonia 
which with fellow baltic states latvia and lithuania was forcibly 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
the measure being debated in latvia would unlike lithuanias 
declaration take effect only after an indefinite transition period 
lawmakers also were expected to vote on dropping the soviet 
socialist from latvias name leaving it simply the republic of 
latvia 
deputies belonging to the latvian peoples front 
proindependence movement said they agreed to the goslow plan on 
secession after watching lithuania struggle unsuccessfully to 
persuade moscow to begin negotiations 
we didnt slam the door and then start to knock said romans 
apsitis a law professor were leaving the door open and still 
moving toward independence 
the proposal would leave most of the republics sovietera 
constitution intact but it would also assert latvias claim to 
independence and its right to reestablish its traditional 
parliament 
although the latvian measure would be less drastic than 
lithuanias it also would not be within the secession procedure 
outlined in a soviet law passed in march 
the law obliges any republic seeking independence to gain 
approval through a referendum and wait up to five years while 
negotiating terms of divorce with moscow opponents say the law 
effectively prevents any republic from seceding 
apsitis said that at most latvia would consider a role in a 
reconfigured soviet confederation but only after gaining 
independence 
because of latvias delicate ethnic balance a declaration of 
independence would likely be less radical than lithuanias 
declaration 
in contrast to lithuania where 80 percent of the people are 
ethnic lithuanian only about 54 percent of latvias population of 
27 million people is ethnic latvian most of the rest are ethnic 
russians many of whom oppose independence 
it will pit russians and latvians against each other said 
soviet army major alexander skryachev 
in the past year latvia has copied lithuanias daring political 
moves in december it abolished the communist partys guarantee on 
power in february it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its 
annexation by the soviet union and last month a large segment of 
its communist party broke off from its moscowbased parent party 
all the moves came within months sometimes weeks of similar 
lithuanian actions

animal rights advocates and the navy have agreed 
on environmental studies on the use of dolphins as security guards 
at the trident nuclear submarine base at bangor 
in addition the navy has agreed in a separate document to stop 
capturing the marine mammals until an environmental impact 
statement on the taking of dolphins from the wild is completed 
both sides said the agreement would delay for months the arrival 
of trained dolphins at the base on hood canal where they would be 
deployed to protect the tridents from underwater intruders 
the agreement announced wednesday negotiated to resolve a 
13monthold federal lawsuit was hailed by john t costo a lawyer 
for the progressive animal welfare society and 14 other groups 
i think its a great settlement costo said and its 
great that the navy has acknowledged that it has obligations under 
federal environmental laws 
congress gave the navy permission in 1987 to capture as many as 
25 dolphins a year without supervision under animalprotection laws 
costo said the navy could decide to make either an environmental 
study or a less extensive environmental assessment of the dolphin 
guard project with no timetable established 
only after the decision is announced can dolphin guards be 
deployed at bangor and if the decision is challenged the navy must 
provide a schedule for deployment plans the animal rights lawyer 
said 
the more extensive study would require public hearings at which 
opponents could present evidence on what they say are the dangers 
of introducing dolphins to colder water than the animals are 
normally used to 
critics had also raised other objections to the program 
including alleged mistreatment of the animals during training but 
as part of the settlement animalrights groups agreed that navy 
environmental review need not publicly discuss operational 
aspects of the program 
before the settlement some opponents said the navy was planning 
to move dolphins to the base within 10 weeks 
the navy has no intention to deploy the animals to bangor in 
june said tom lapuzza of the naval ocean systems center in san 
diego it is not within the cards at all for us to bring that 
system to bangor this summer

president bush today scrapped us plans for 
modernizing battlefield nuclear weapons in west germany and called 
upon the western alliance to conduct a wholesale strategy review to 
fit the transformed europe of the 1990s 
with nato foreign ministers wrapping up their meeting in 
brussels bush said a nato summit will convene in late june or 
early july responding to the lessening threat from a shrinking 
eastern bloc he said the united states would not modernize 
nucleartipped battlefield artillery in europe and would 
terminate plans to deploy a newer and morepowerful lance 
missile 
bush also told a white house news conference he isnt trying to 
force out the man who now oversees the nations troubled savings 
and loan industry federal deposit insurance corp chief l william 
seidman 
he said seidman had decided not to complete his full term which 
expires late next year bush said seidman had called him earlier 
today to urge the nomination of william taylor now acting director 
of the resolution trust corp as his successor 
bush did not announce the pull back of any current missile 
deployments but said the nato summit would authorize negotiations 
with the soviet union on shortrange missiles in europe to begin 
after agreement on the reduction of conventional forces in europe 
on the subject of us hostages held in lebanon bush said he 
was cheered by the release of two american hostages but was not 
willing to make any conciliatory gestures toward iran at this time 
he said he was not certain that the recent releases would lead to 
quick freedom for other hostages 
bush said he wanted to meet with us allies after his may 
30june 3 superpower summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev he was asked about the jeering directed toward gorbachev 
during the may day parade in red square and said such vocal 
opposition comes with democracy 
thats the fruits of democracy said bush hes just 
learning 
he was asked about a report out of europe about a possible 
military coup which did not occur bush said hed seen no 
intelligence about such a threat to gorbachev but he added i do 
from time to time worry about a takeover that will set back the 
whole process of change 
bush characterized as very very positive a statement on 
wednesday by lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis in response 
to a call from the leaders of franch and west germany urging 
restraint from the rebellious baltic republic 
earlier in an opening statement bush signalled his hopes for 
the new era in europe 
as democracy comes to eastern europe and soviet troops return 
home there is less need for nuclear systems of a shorter range 
bush said in announcing the dramatic military changes 
although britain has sought a us modernization of 700 aging 
lance missiles in europe bushs decision not to upgrade them goes 
along with the views of most nato members the decision not to 
modernize nucleartipped artillary will be particularily popular in 
west germany where most are deployed 
bush said hed issued the call for a summit of leaders from the 
16 members of the north atlantic treaty alliance after consulting 
personally with my nato colleagues the session would launch a 
wideranging strategy review for the transformed europe of the 
1990s 
bush said the intelligence community was trying to determine now 
whether the releases of former hostages robert polhill and frank 
reed were part of a process that would lead to freedom for the 
remaining six americans in captivity 
bush said he was prepared to do anything that wouldnt be 
perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages he said he 
was willing to try to determine the fate of four iranians kidnapped 
in beirut in 1982 but said they were believed dead 
ive tried hard not to raise the hopes of the hostage 
families and then have them dashed he said 
bush reiterated the us position that the united states wanted 
to see all hostages released but sidestepped commenting on 
whether this should also include 400 shiites being held by israel 
iran has demanded that these prisoners be released including 
moslem leader sheik obeid 
i want to see all hostages released in all countries 
bush said but he said there were definitional problems 
concerning those held by israel because some people view people 
they hold as having broken laws and some people dont 
bush was to meet later in the day with lithuanian prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene he embraced the statement from lithuanian 
president landsbergis that seemed to lessen chances of a 
confrontation between lithuanian leaders and moscow 
whatever facilitates dialogue is good bush said at the 
same time bush indicated there was no change in us position 
toward moscow over the crisis in lithuania 
he denied that his administrations proposal the day before for 
relaxing export controls on western hightech products sent to the 
soviet union and eastern europe had been any form of reward for 
moscows restraint 
bush made the nato announcements as secretary of state james a 
baker iii met in brussels with nato allies 
baker proposed that 35 foreign ministers from east and west meet 
in new york in late september to pave the way for a summit by the 
end of the year to formally sign agreements to reduce conventional 
forces throughout europe 
on other subjects 
bush said that i didnt tell you im anxious to see bill 
seidman leave as head of the fdic but neither did he urge 
seidman to stay i think his decision is a personal one and i 
support him and hes entitled to make it bush said there was no 
discussion of timing on seidmans retirement 
he conceded a difference of opinion existed with mexican 
officials over the us role in the abduction of a mexican doctor 
now awaiting trial in los angeles in the 1985 slaying of a us 
drug enforcement agent the united states has denied mexican 
charges that it had the doctor kidnapped we dont want a 
misunderstanding with mexico we dont need it bush said 
the president acknowledged that nobody is enthusiastic about 
the fiscal 1991 budget he sent to congress last winter but added 
that the same is true about democratic budgets he said hell meet 
with democratic congressional leaders sunday to decide what to do 
next were not into a negotiation were talking process he 
said 
bush said that the wellsley college students who object to 
barbara bushs commeencement address on their suburban boston 
campus massachusetts can learn a lot from the first lady the 
students object on grounds that her prominence stems only from her 
husband the american people love her becauseshe stands for 
something he said

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
today branded the us administration a stubborn frustrated 
child for refusing to make a goodwill gesture in reponse to the 
release of two american hostages in lebanon 
he also declared in a speech broadcast by tehran radio 
monitored in nicosia iran does not want relations with the 
united states and we welcomed severing ties we are not 
prepared to talk to america 
rafsanjanis comments made in an address to a group of teachers 
in tehran appeared to rule out the possibility of a dialogue with 
the united states after 11 years of hostility 
but they also indicated that rafsanjani leader of irans 
socalled pragmatists was under mounting pressure from 
antiwestern radicals angered at irans role in the release of the 
two americans held by proiranian shiite moslem militants in 
lebanon 
robert polhill 55 of new york was freed april 22 eight days 
later frank reed 57 of malden mass was released sixteen 
other westerners six of them americans remain missing in lebanon 
most are believed held by factions linked to the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god 
rafsanjani admitted that the lebanese groups who freed polhill 
and reed had done so at our suggestion they could have 
rejected our advice but they accepted our advice 
rafsanjanis comments echoed remarks on wednesday by irans 
spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei that tehran is against 
talks with the united states khamenei said that the islamic 
republic government would not possibly do so without my consent 
president bush said today he was cheered by the release of two 
american hostages but was unwilling to make any conciliatory 
gestures toward iran at this time 
he said he was prepared to do anything that wouldnt be 
perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages 
tehran radio reporting other parts of rafsanjanis speech said 
rafsanjani likened washingtons nodeal response to the hostage 
releases to that of a stubborn frustrated child 
someone should have taken the first step to solve the hostage 
issue rafsanjani declared the expectation was that a 
government like the united states which is a big government would 
step in and solve the issue but here the lebanese warriors seized 
the initiative and released the hostages without conditions 
he added instead of giving an appropriate reward for this 
initiative the us reacted by saying it will not negotiate with 
kidnappers as if israel and the lebanese phalangists are not 
kidnappers 
that was a reference to hundreds of arabs held by israel 
including hezbollah leader sheik abdulkarim obeid seized in 
lebanon july 28 and four iranians seized by lebanese christian 
militiamen in july 1982 
referring to polhills release rafsanjani said that an angry 
revolutionary enraged group after it released one hostage without 
preconditions and was confronted with americas irresponsible 
reaction should reasonably have taken revenge 
but they still showed decency and showed their extreme 
goodwill by freeing reed as well he said 
referring to bushs public thanks to iran and syria for their 
role in last months releases rafsanjani said that on the one 
hand the united states thanked iran and syria for their efforts in 
releasing the hostages 
on the other hand it started a vile propaganda move stating 
we will not normalize ties until iran releases all hostages 
meanwhile american hostage thomas sutherland turned 59 today 
and spent his fifth birthday in captivity his wife sent him 
birthday greetings in a message published by a leftist beirut 
newspaper 
jean sutherlands message carried by assafir in arabic and 
english said i send you the best gift i have my dear a red 
red rose of love may it touch your heart and spirit in a special 
way on this your special day 
mrs sutherland lives on the campus of the american university 
of beirut where she teaches english sutherland was acting dean of 
agriculture at the school when he was kidnapped on june 9 1985 
sutherland of fort collins colo is the second longestheld 
hostage in lebanon a proiranian group calling itself islamic 
jihad or islamic holy war has claimed responsibility for 
sutherlands abduction 
the group also holds american journalist terry anderson 42 of 
lorain ohio anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longestheld western hostage in lebanon 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
reed who said he was held with sutherland and anderson up until 
a year ago was freed monday after being held for 3 years by 
proiranian shiite moslem militants 
reed also said he had been kept in a house in beirut with two 
other hostages brian keenan and john mccarthy both british 
citizens 
in london today prime minister margaret thatcher welcomed help 
by syria and iran in securing the two american hostages freedom 
and said her government was using diplomatic contacts to seek the 
release of british captives 
but she reiterated that the british government would make no 
deals with the hostage takers 
we note that america has done no deals but it is in fact 
through quiet contacts that her hostages have been released she 
told the house of commons 
the most rev robert runcie spiritual leader of the church of 
england and the worldwide anglican communion said today he had no 
quarrel with his governments policy of making no deals that would 
reward the kidnappers 
over the past 10 days the iranian government have demonstrated 
that with syrian support they can use their influence to bring 
about the release of hostages said runcie whose personal envoy 
terry waite is among the captives the time has come runcie said 
for direct talks 
that of course is a twosided matter it needs willingness 
on both sides to talk he said 
keenans sister elaine spence talked by telephone with reed 
and said he condemned very strongly very bitterly the british 
government for not doing anything at all 
he cant believe that this prime minister mrs thatcher can 
take such a stand as he said the irony of it but words after 
that to describe mrs thatcher i wouldnt repeat what frank reed 
said mrs spence told bbc radio from her home in belfast 
northern ireland

washn to shift 
 
and act like everything is normal 
 
q well what are you really doing now 
a ive just given you one example and if there are others why 
 
 
q but are you passing this word to iran and also in terms 
a yeah 
 
q of the frozen assets 
a well thats been going on as you know some discussion on 
frozen assets abe sofaer has been over there so and if they 
view that as goodwill fine i mean that that and if that can 
continue now in some way fine but that weve already discussed in 
open and im not sure they would view that as enough you know 
 
q does it look brighter though 
a this is a third followon here laughs i dont know 
helen and its an awful good question and look i have tried 
very hard not to raise the hopes of the hostage families only to 
have them dashed 
and theres a certain cruelty in this process when you flash a 
picture of a of a person thats held hostage and then another 
person appears into in freedom i welcome the release of polhill 
and reed but i cant rejoice and say that my heart is full of 
great goodwill as long as six others are held hostage 
yes terry 
 
q mr president within the last two weeks youve been 
considering penalties against moscow for its treatment of 
lithuania now however youre liberalizing sales of computers and 
other high technology to moscow senator damato among others 
says that now is not the time to be nice to the soviet union why 
have you decided on this course of reward rather than punishment 
a well i dont consider the cocom reevaluation a policy of 
reward ill have to discuss that with al damato to see that he 
understands the facts because what were doing is putting up 
tighter walls around needed needed items that are in the national 
security interest 
and then where there arent when the other items that are not 
on the list for pure national security now theyre going to come 
off and i i dont view this as giving something to the soviets 
at all 
so we just have a difference of opinion with the good senator 
 
q following up on lithuania do you endorse the idea from west 
germany and britain that lithuania suspend some of its the laws 
pertaining to independence 
a i think this is a matter that landsbergis spoke to yesterday 
and indicated some flexibility there and whatever will facilitate 
dialogue is good and he has seen some merit in what was suggested 
by mitterrand and kohl and i think that is very very positive and 
lets hope it goes forward 
yes right here and then over here 
 
q mr president on the hostages didnt the ceremonious 
welcome that you gave mr polhill here the other night and his 
access to you to pass a message supposedly from his captors send a 
signal to terrorists that the best way to communicate with the 
president of the united states is to capture an american and give 
him a message 
and second didnt the welcome given polhill suggest that even 
citizens who disobey their governments warnings and then are 
captured something their government is trying to prevent can then 
be treated as heroes even by the president 
a both of these considerations worry me brit to be very 
honest with you and i must say i enjoyed this meeting with this 
highly civil human being who has a marvelous sense of humor in 
spite of his captivity and im delighted 
but what happened on that one was we hadnt planned a great 
public ceremony of this nature what happened is this timing was 
such that mr reed came out there was keen interest in having a 
response to the president and so we accommodated this interest 
understandable interest by having a press conference 
so it got it wasnt time to make a high highest visibility 
reception of polhill the other thing is he did have a message for 
me and ive said im going to go the extra mile i am not going to 
leave any stone unturned and he brought it he asked that it be 
kept confidential and it will and i think that i dont think 
that part of it is bad 
i think that part shows that the i dont worry so much of the 
message what i do worry about is if anybody perceives that were 
putting a higher price on some human being by all of this so i was 
troubled by what you said but i sorted it out and did my best 
 
q well what about the message sir can you tell us without 
laying it out in detail whether it taught you anything new about 
the situation over there 
a no it did not teach me anything new about it but it was the 
capsulist putting it all in one capsule that was very 
interesting and i will share it discreetly with key members of our 
national security council and the intelligence community but i 
must i must not violate his request that the message be 
confidential 
yeah lesley and then john

the boy scouts of america organization has asked 
a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by an agnostic who said 
he and his 6yearold son were rejected from a scout chapter for 
refusing to profess faith in god 
elliott welsh of suburban hinsdale filed the lawsuit last fall 
saying the organization practiced religious discrimination 
the boy scouts based in irving texas has required its 
members now numbering about 43 million to do my duty to god 
and my country since its founding 80 years ago said scouts 
spokesman lee sneath 
walsh and his son mark now 7 were rejected when they noted on 
cub scout membership applications they would not agree to religious 
stipulations because they were agnostic the cub scouts is a branch 
of the boy scouts for younger boys 
when the scouts refused to change the policy walsh filed suit 
charging that it violated the part of the 1964 civil rights act 
that bans religious discrimination in public accommodations 
the scouts contend their units are more like private clubs 
which are excluded from that provision of the civil rights law 
scouts attorney thomas d allen asked us district judge ilana 
rovner on wednesday to dismiss the lawsuit 
rovner delayed the request for further consideration after 
welshs attorney richard grossman said the scouts are a public 
body because they invite all boys to join 
if theyre going to give a flier to every kid in the 1st grade 
inviting him to join then theyve got to accept the consequences 
of having their organization subject to the same laws as a 
mcdonalds or a movie theater grossman argued 
also wednesday robert l sherman national spokesman for 
american atheists inc held a news conference to demand that the 
united way cut off its annual support to the boy scouts in the 
chicago area after his 8yearold son was rejected from the club 
for the same reason 
he said the united way should cut off about 15 million to 
chicago chapters of the boy scouts because of the united way 
policy prohibiting gifts to organizations that discriminate on the 
basis of religion the united way will appoint a committee to look 
into the charges said spokeswoman julia hess 
sneath said the scouts will not change the policy even if the 
united way organizations cut off their donations which make up 
about 13 percent of the organizations 350 million annual 
operating budget 
as a private membership organization we have a right to set 
our own standards for membership and leadership he said we do 
not discriminate on the basis of religion and i dont know that 
anyone has ever proved that having no belief is a religion

president bush said today that while he 
welcomes the recent release of two americans hostages in lebanon 
he cant rejoice as long as six others are held hostage 
asked whether the release of frank reed and robert polhill might 
fortell the release of all americans bush said i cant say that 
our actions facilitated the release of reed and polhill 
i hope that the affirmation and reaffirmation of our policy 
contributed but there were no behindthescenes actions that 
pulled this off bush said at a morning news conference 
the president said he welcomed the release of reed and polhill 
but i cant rejoice and say my heart is full of hope and goodwill 
as long as six others are held hostages 
the six include terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press who was kidnapped in march 1985 and is 
the longestheld western hostage in lebanon 
bush said he would be willing to make goodwill gestures to iran 
that wouldnt be perceived as negotiating for the release of 
hostages 
asked what those gestures might be the president mentioned that 
iran was anxious to learn about four iranian diplomats kidnapped in 
lebanon in 1982 
if we could go back and get any information that would relieve 
the anxiety of the loved ones of those people we ought to do 
that bush said i can understand the iranians wanting the full 
accounting here theyve said here is an area where we can get 
information 
he said the united states does not think the four diplomats are 
still alive but added my point is that if iran feels that way 
this is something we should use to disperse the lack of information 
to bring them the facts if we can 
here is something we can do without violating our policy and i 
think they would consider this good will there is a human equation 
here bush said 
the president was asked about the 400 moslems mostly shiites 
held in israeli prison camps whose release is demanded by iran 
i have stated my position that hostage holding is unproductive 
towards any political change and i want to see all hostages 
released the president said there are definitional problems 
because some people view the people that they hold as having broken 
their laws it is not for the united states to make those 
determinations

west german president richard von 
weizsaecker paid homage to the victims of the nazi holocaust today 
retracing their path from the warsaw ghetto to the treblinka death 
camp 
at treblinka accompanied by president wojciech jaruzelski 
weizsaecker laid a wreath of flowers at the monument commemorating 
the more than 800000 jews who died there 
they both stood silently and bowed their heads at the foot of 
the 25foot stone memorial which is surrounded by hundreds of 
small rocks some bearing names of the hometowns and villages of 
the victims 
later weizsaecker laid flowers at a stone dedicated to jewish 
educator janusz korczak and the children from the orphanage he ran 
in the warsaw ghetto who died with him at treblinka 
neither weizsaecker nor jaruzelski spoke during the solemn 
ceremony in front of the monument which is inscribed with the 
words never again in six languages 
weizsaeckers trip to poland has a big moral and emotional 
dimension the proof of which is that we are here together today 
jaruzelski told reporters before leaving treblinka 
in relations between poles and germans moral problems and 
moral values are important he said and this visit it seems 
to me has created conditions for mutual understanding and trust 
and this leads to reconciliation 
weizsaecker the first west german head of state to visit 
poland later was to have a second meeting with prime minister 
tadesuz mazoweicki he arrived in poland on wednesday 
in warsaw the west german president visited a monument to the 
doomed jewish insurgents who staged the 1943 ghetto uprising 
against the nazis then he went to umschlagplatz the station where 
jews were loaded onto death trains en route to treblinka 50 miles 
northeast 
treblinka was built to carry out hitlers final solution an 
estimated 56000 jews were gassed to death after the 1943 uprising 
alone 
hundreds of thousands more from poland and other countries died 
most within a halfhour of their arrival in all 6 million poles 
died in the war including 3 million jews much of the country 
including warsaw was left in rubble 
weizsaeckers visit to treblinka has taken on added significance 
because of the mixed feelings with which poles view german 
unification he has taken pains to assure poles they have nothing 
to fear from a united germany next door 
if the germans and the poles are to find a common future this 
will only be possible by taking honest account of the past 
inexpressible suffering has been inflicted on you by germans and 
today this weighs heavily on us weizsaecker said wednesday at a 
dinner given by jaruzelski 
he reiterated that polands chief concern the permanence of its 
postwar western border will be resolved 
poland may be unreservedly confident that the border questions 
between us are irrevocably cleared in their essence and that in the 
process of forming german unity they will receive a proper 
legally and internationally binding treaty he said 
on wednesday west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher met wednesday with polish foreign minister krzysztof 
skubiszewski to discuss a polish draft of a border treaty 
in addition to a border treaty poland is seeking a seat at 
unification talks held by the four world war ii allies and the two 
germanys

washn then john 
 
q mr president back to europe for a minute your actions 
speak to a policy of helping gorbachev even though your own 
defense secretary says hes probably not going to succeed i guess 
i guess and i think this is a question a lot of americans would 
like to hear you answer why have you decided on gorbachev over 
speaking out for american principle in 
a i dont think i have lesley 
 
q well what about lithuanian independence over gorbachev 
a i dont think thats the choice i dont think thats the 
choice and let me repeat here if anybody has any doubt about 
where their president stands of course we favor 
selfdetermination i dont think thats new my saying that 
and of course we favor democracy and freedom theres a lot at 
stake in all of this and theres a lot theres complications in 
all of this poland eastern europe i want those troops out and 
i want to see that the firming up of the democracies in eastern 
europe and i want to see us keep this process going forward 
so our foreign policy is not based on just mr gorbachev now 
if the man has done something good and surprised everybody in this 
room including me about the acceptance of freedom and democracy 
in eastern europe and he has give credit for that 
but on lithuania theres an enormously complicated problem and 
i must say im looking forward to visiting with the prime 
minister in a little bit of lithuania 
but i must convince the lithuanianamericans that my desire for 
their freedom and their selfdetermine is just as strong as anybody 
elses and i also must convince those here and around the world 
that we want to see the peaceful evolution thats taking place 
towards democracy continue 
so when terry asked his question about about dialogue that is 
our policy and im delighted to see that landsbergis now feels 
there may be some merits in this policy 
but lesley we cant place this on a you have to choose 
between gorbachev or landsbergis thats not the policy of the 
united states government nor it should be nor should it be 
 
q and i have a followup the may day parade mr gorbachev was 
heckled your defense decretary says that he doesnt think that mr 
gorbachev can succeed with his reforms do you 
a the may day parade he ought to come join some of the parades 
i go to around here and this goes for your horse too i mean 
its laughter you ought to see some of the some of the 
expression of you know i mean look thats the fruits of 
democracy laughter hes just learning hes just learning so 
i wouldnt read too much into that 
yes theres some discontent and a lot of it relates to the 
economy and some of it relates by to the lithuanians inside 
the soviet union to the handling of lithuania but thats whats 
theres a good side to all of this 
i sometimes ask myself if thats true but it is scattered 
laughter because thats the way you know fledgling democracies 
are beginning to work and thats the way our system has worked 
and i dont suppose if everybody anytime anyone points to a 
demonstration that gets rambunctious in the united states and 
points to that means instability in the united states system 
theres got to be something crazy because that isnt the way it 
works 
john 
 
q you seem to be getting serious about the budget now 
youve invited congressional leaders to the white house sunday 
night to talk about the budget no one in congress believes your 
budget projections partly because interest rates have risen since 
you released your budget 
a thats thats the key

the canadian army 
mobilized assault vehicles at the border and a federal mediator was 
called in after two indians were slain in a dispute over casino 
gambling on the reservation 
us and canadian authorities kept the 28000acre reservation 
straddling the border sealed off as federal state and provincial 
representatives met with indian leaders today near montreal for 
talks on restoring order 
the morning meeting was closed to reporters 
hundreds of heavily armed state police royal canadian mounted 
police and canadian provincial police moved in tuesday after two 
men were shot to death in a dispute among mohawks over whether to 
allow gambling on the reservation 
the first fatalities in the 9monthold dispute prompted state 
police to break their policy of not setting foot on the reservation 
unless invited mohawks consider the reservation sovereign 
territory 
no shots had been heard for more than a day still many of the 
mohawks living on the reservation remained in their homes 
im not venturing out said jack hubert a retiree i 
dont want to spend my golden years being shot at 
the canadian army moved 80 vehicles to cornwall ontario 
including 14 amphibious assault vehicles two helicopters and four 
armored personnel carriers 
canadas solicitor general pierre cadieux said the police would 
take away any illegal arms they found 
the canadian military were offering only equipment and 
engineering support and that no infantry had been summoned to the 
reservation he said 
basically were giving a nonlethal support role said 
capt cliff collison of the first battalion of royal canadian 
regiment if anybodys going to do any shooting it will be the 
police 
gov mario cuomo ordered the national guard to assist state 
police by transporting troopers and providing equipment but said he 
would not send guardsmen onto the reservation because it might 
provoke more violence 
before you use military force you should use the force of 
reason cuomo said 
fletcher graves a mediator from the us justice department who 
has helped the mohawks resolve other disputes arrived on the 
reservation wednesday afternoon said john boots a member of the 
progambling warrior society 
i dont know what my role will be until i get there well 
talk to every party graves said after being dispatched to the 
reservation 
the issue of gambling has been at the center of escalating 
violence since last summer the dispute has been marked by gunfire 
arson and blockades and up to 600 mohawks fled to ontario last 
week after a week of nightly violence 
progambling forces say the reservations six casinos where 
slot machines craps bingo and other games draw busloads of 
patrons from the northeast are an economic boon opponents argue 
they encourage prostitution and drug use and threaten traditional 
ways 
early tuesday 22yearold matthew pyke a casino opponent was 
slain while walking in the reservation in snye quebec not far 
away jr edwards 30 a proponent of gambling was found dead 
next to his house 
more than 600 police and soldiers in and around the reservation

vehicles for guns at a dozen roadblocks earlier mohawk children 
waited for school buses beside troopers 
the owner of the reservations largest casino tony laughing 
was arrested wednesday after police found a canister of tear gas in 
his car authorities said police also caught three reporters from 
the ottawa citizen trying to cross the st lawrence river in a boat 
to get onto the american side of the reservation authorities said 
the reporters were sent back to canada

a fire caused major damage to a 
government office building thursday officials said it was the 
third fire in a government building in the capital in less than 
three weeks 
the blaze destroyed one floor of offices used by the agriculture 
ministry the only casualty was a firefighter who was injured when 
he fell from the second floor where the fire started said rk 
nyogi a police commissioner 
nyogi said an investigation was under way into the cause of the 
fire we cant rule out anything he said when asked if arson 
was a possibility 
it has not been determined what caused the two previous fires 
the first on april 16 destroyed the interior of the capitals 
main conference center a few days later fire broke out in nirman 
bhavan where the housing ministry is located there were no 
casualties in either incident 
nriterequals 
new york ap retail sales generally rebounded in april as 
consumers returned to stores to shop for easter and spring items 
several of the nations biggest retailers reported today 
many retailers who had a dismal march posted better results last 
month woolworth corp whose sales fell in march compared to a 
year earlier had an 182 percent sales gain in april at stores 
open at least a year and a 211 percent increase overall 
results from stores open a year or longer known as same or 
comparablestore sales give a more accurate reading of a 
retailers performance industry analysts therefore give them more 
weight than overall sales figures 
changes in the calendar such as easter falling on april 9 this 
year and on march 26 last year often have an impact on retail 
sales and affect yeartoyear comparisons but after accounting for 
the shift the industrys overall results were generally favorable 
said jeffrey feiner a retail analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
analysts consider march and april sales together in assessing 
how well a store has performed 
shoppers again spent most of their money on apparel and 
lowerpriced items while generally shying away from more expensive 
purchases consumers remained burdened by high installment debt and 
were again cautious about major expenditures 
analysts expect this trend which has been in place for several 
years to continue 
retail sales are closely watched not only as a gauge of the 
industrys health but also as an economic barometer consumer 
spending accounts for about twothirds of the gross national 
product 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer reported 
a 31 percent increase over april 1989 results in samestore sales 
and a 16 percent sales gain overall 
walmart stores inc again outdistanced other retailers 
reporting a 7 percent increase in samestore sales while overall 
results were up 20 percent 
jc penney co inc had a disappointing month after a much 
stronger march penneys samestore sales fell 28 percent while 
overall sales were off 17 percent 
melville corp which runs specialty chains including thom mcan 
kaybee and cvs said its overall sales rose 219 percent melville 
did not release samestore figures 
other major retailers including dayton hudson corp and may 
department stores co are expected to announce their sales figures 
next thursday analysts said it appeared these companies which 
own some of the countrys biggest department store chains would 
report favorable results 
the results announced today differ from the federal governments 
monthly retail sales report besides stores the governments 
figures include sales at a range of establishments from auto 
dealerships and supermarkets to restaurants and movie theaters

the army imposed a curfew today on the west 
bank city of nablus to prevent demonstrations against a jewish 
seminary that palestinians fear will become the core of the citys 
first israeli settlement 
tension was high in nablus after 10 rightwing parliament 
members including former defense minster ariel sharon said they 
planned to attend a religious ceremony today at the seminary or 
yeshiva 
however only rehovoam zeevi a parliament member who advocates 
expulsion of palestinians from the occupied territories and geulah 
cohen head of the nationalist tehiya party arrived in nablus the 
army radio said 
the army also permitted only 100 settlers to take part 
thwarting the settlers plans to bring in 17 busloads of supporters 
the military also permitted a small group from the leftist peace 
now movement to stage a protest at the site the legendary burial 
place of the son of the biblical patriarch jacob 
the palestinians regard the ceremony as a symbolic increase of 
the jewish presence in the city that comes amidst the governments 
stepped up settlement drive 
daniella weiss a settlement leader said the ceremony was 
purely religious 
maybe it looks like there is a political purpose but it is 
only religious she said i do not think that we should cancel 
or postpone our celebration because of political implications 
the ceremony came a few days after a top aide to hardline prime 
minister yitzhak shamir announced he wanted to build sleeping 
quarters for the yeshiva students under current army orders the 
students must leave nablus at night to avoid clashes with the 
120000 arab residents 
palestinians believe building a dormitory will constitute a 
permanent settlement in nablus a focus of antiisraeli violence 
during the nearly 29monthold palestinian rebellion against 
israeli occupation 
recent settlement activity has strained relations between israel 
and the united states which considers jewish settlement in 
occupied lands an obstacle to peace 
since march 15 when the coalition of shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc and the leftleaning labor party fell apart and left shamir as 
caretaker prime minister ground has been broken on two new 
settlements fourteen other sites are reportedly under 
consideration 
several hours before the ceremony at the yeshiva was to begin 
roadblocks were erected at entrances to nablus to keep out 
nonresidents soldiers searched palestinian homes nearby and about 
a dozen observation posts were erected on rooftops overlooking the 
building arab witnesses said 
an army spokesman said the curfew imposed on the city and its 
surrounding refugee camps confined about 160000 people to their 
homes 
the measures were aimed at preventing confrontations between 
palestinians and settlers the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement 
had called on palestinians to attack soldiers and settlers in 
protest 
a settlement in nablus will create a new wave of 
confrontations with the settlers ghassan shakaa a proplo 
nablus lawyer said in a phone interview this proves how the 
radicals in israel are working against peace 
leftwing israelis joined the outcry legislator dedi zucker of 
the citizens rights movement said the nablus ceremony was part 
of a much larger picture of shamirs drive to create more 
settlements in the occupied lands 
noam livnat a spokesman for the seminary said the ceremony 
would be an assertion of jewish claims of sovereignty over eretz 
israel a hebrew phrase for the biblical land of israel that 
includes the west bank 
we are not just talking about bringing a torah to the 
seminary but about a declaration that eretz israel is ours all 
of it only ours livnat said on israel radio 
students of the jospehs tomb seminary have been involved in 
several clashes with palestinians that have led to bloodshed 
in june 1989 about 30 yeshiva students rampaged through the 
west bank village of kifl harith burning trees smashing windows 
and firing guns at random a 13yearold girl was shot and killed 
and four seminary students were subsequently indicted in the case 
the yeshivas rabbi yitzhak ginzburg created a furor in israel

washn seidman leave 
 
q arent you saying that you wouldnt be unhappy to see him 
leave 
a bill seidman asked to see me a while back came to see me 
said he was not going to fulfill his rest of his term and we 
discussed that he asked to see me to tell me that today he 
called me and with the name of a successor that he 
enthusiastically supports 
and hes done a good job we have a significant project that 
hes in the middle of handling we call it the june 30th project 
to get a lot more done with a lot of these savings and loan in a 
short period of time and hes agreed to enthusiastically tackle 
that 
so and he also said look i understand if you might want to 
put your own person in there but he its his initiative with 
me and today he suggested the name of a bill taylor who were very 
high on to take over his responsibilities 
so its one where everyone wants to have winners and losers and 
i dont think there are any i think seidman has conducted himself 
with extraordinary grace and great ability and ive known him for 
years worked with him in way back when 
yeah 
 
q mr president the costs how to deal with the increased 
costs 
a well weve got to work with the congress on how to deal with 
the cost and right now theres a significant review going forward 
to see what the costs are the figures change all the time on you 
yeah 
 
q mr president you talked a minute ago about fledgling 
democracies in eastern europe why or has your administration 
given any thought to a wholesale reevaluation of the americas 
foreign aid requirements now that the warsaw pact is collapsing 
and two whats your response to those who say that we ought to 
take some money from the military and spend it on foreign aid for 
these fledgling democracies 
a well my response to the latter part is everybody wants to 
take money for defense to do something else 
and the defense secretary and i want to provide adequately for 
the defense in a changing world and i think dick cheneys done a 
good job up there trying to hold the line against a congress that 
says any time theres a need for anything please take it out of 
defense 
and so were in a problem of my trying to hold the line ably 
supported by in some instances led by dick cheney whos up there 
really fighting this battle 
what was the first part excuse me 
 
q about the fullscale review of americas foreign aid 
requirements are you interested in doing one of those or not 
a well id be interested in a fullscale review i mean weve 
heard a lot of you know a lot of our percentage of aid goes to a 
handful of countries and here we have a man coming in here today 
prime minister of jamaica mr manley who has just done a first 
class job in trying to move jamaica forward in many many ways and 
i salute him for that 
but his aid was a small amount and i believe its been just 
lined out because of insufficient resources or failure to 
reallocate 
ive suggested that the president be given a discretionary fund 
out of all this foreign aid so we can accommodate a person that is 
trying to take his small country and firm up its democracy 
so i think a review of the nature youre talking about might be 
helpful but i remember my days in congress foreign aid doesnt 
have the constituency out there that domestic programs do 
yes maureen and then charles 
 
q mr president have you done an analysis of these hostage 
releases such that you conclude whether or not this is the 
beginning of a process thats likely to reach all the releases and 
what is the united states doing behind the scenes that might have 
contributed to these releases we know youre talking to iran 
through third countries but can you give us 
a i cant say that our actions facilitated the relief of 
release of reed and and polhill i hope that the affirmation and 
reaffirmation of our policy might have contributed to it but there 
was no behindthescenes negotiations that will come out that show 
that we pulled this off 
i wish i could well i dont i was going to say i wish i 
could say that was true but it would have to be true within 
these confines ive spelled out here earlier on 
but were we will continue to stay with the policy trying to 
show goodwill where we can do it without violating the policy 
 
q and have you concluded sir whether this is the beginning of 
a process 
a oh intelligence community is looking at that right now the 
debrief of reed and the debrief of polhill might contribute to 
that but you can rest assured that i have asked for that answer 
will this lead to inevitably to the release of others but i 
cant say that theres ive gotten any feeling that this process 
is destined to go forward in a short period of time 
i wish it were different i so wish it were different 
yeah charles 
 
q mr president theres a report in europe today citing 
western intelligence sources that on february 25th the day of the 
large demonstrations in moscow mr gorbachev was perilously close 
to being overthrown the soviet army troops were mobilized is it 
your assessment that he has come that close to facing a coup of 
some sort within the soviet union 
a i was not advised of that by the intelligence community

flooding claimed nine lives damaged crops and sent residents 
scrambling from their homes drenching rain 60 mph wind and 
tornadoes continued today 
not since 1922 have we had rain like this said ed delgado 
spokesman for the national weather service in fort worth we have 
seen some lakes rise in water level by four feet overnight and 
there is more rain in the forecast

occasionally zapped the area including one early today that 
touched down in paris damaging 18 homes and businesses and 
injuring eight people 
amid sheets of gray rain cars floated through neighborhoods 
bumping into each other muck settled on living room floors while 
police evacuated flooded houses looters prowled abandoned 
neighborhoods in boats 
its a sad situation said lana brueggemeyer a grand 
prairie homeowner whose home has been flooded twice this year 
but its the elements of nature you just dont guess i would 
prefer not to go back 
two elderly men became the seventh and eighth fatalities of the 
weather wednesday morning in fort worth after they apparently

being replenished 
the edwards aquifer which runs through southwestern texas was 
in dire need of rainfall after wellbelow average rainfall from

agriculture officials say the rains are wreaking havoc with 
winter wheat flooding saturates the ground and cuts off the 
plants supply of oxygen

storm today including us 175 a major dallas freeway the 
heaviest rainfall moved out of the dallasfort worth area before

a world war ii historian is making his 
third attempt to recapture his old congressional seat and this time 
hes making morality the cornerstone of his campaign 
ken hechler 75 has been west virginias secretary of state 
since 1985 he also has been political science professor and wrote 
the bridge at remagen about the armys dash across the rhine 
river during world war ii 
a congressman for 18 years he lost the democratic nomination 
for governor to jay rockefeller in 1976 while his party endorsed 
nick joe rahall ii for his congressional seat rahall survived 
hechlers writein campaign in november 1976 and beat hechler in 
the 1978 primary 
had he not chosen to give up the seat im sure hed still be 
the congressman from this district rahall said 
the district includes eight mostly povertystricken counties 
south of charleston that produce a large chunk of the nations 
bituminous coal 
hechler said he is running because congress has deteriorated 
since he left 
it is now dominated by political action groups id like to 
take it by the scruff of the neck and shake it up a bit hechler 
said 
rahall chairman of the house mining subcommittee has been 
endorsed by the states major labor unions 
the 40yearold rahall also amassed more than 479000 for his 
campaign by march 30 according to financial reports hechler has 
raised about 3000 and loaned his campaign more than 100000 
using radio commercials hechlers strategy has been to focus on 
morality 
his campaign jingle which he wrote and set to a folksy tune 
urges voters to elect him so theyll have a congressman with high 
moral standards again 
hechler denies taking a dig at rahall who was plagued in the 
last election by drunken driving charges in california in 1988 and 
was sued in 1984 by a las vegas casino for 60000 in gambling 
debts 
rahall has interpreted hechlers commercials differently 
accusing hechler of running a gutterstyle campaign he said he 
is tired of having his past exhumed every two years 
those are personal items he said there has been nothing 
in my record to question my honesty and integrity when it comes to 
my public responsibilities 
both candidates agree that west virginians outrage at former 
republican gov arch moore following his indictment last month on 
extortion fraud and obstruction of justice charges could spark a 
rush to expel incumbents 
the higher the turnout the more chance i have hechler said 
rahall said the moore indictment comes at a bad time 
incumbents are as angered as their constituents rahall 
said there are hardworking honest incumbents who shouldnt be 
thrown out i believe the people are going to be fair 
the rahallhechler scrap is the only contested race for congress 
in tuesdays primary election 
reps alan b mollohan harley o staggers jr and robert e 
wise jr all fourthterm democrats are running unopposed for 
renomination 
republicans outnumbered 2to1 in west virginia have 
uncontested races in three of the four districts and no republican 
primary is being held in the fourth

britons voting in nationwide elections today were 
expected to hand prime minister margaret thatcher the worst 
electoral drubbing of her 11 years in power and register strong 
opposition to her economic policies 
officials reported a brisk turnout during the daylong balloting 
in brilliant sunshine across most of the country 
in britain votes are counted by hand and most results were to 
be declared in the early hours friday several hours after the 
polls closed 
the ballot for 201 local councils was the conservative party 
prime ministers biggest electoral test since her popularity began 
dropping a year ago to a now record low due in part to higher 
interest rates and inflation 
the opposition socialist labor party held a huge lead of more 
than 20 points recent opinion polls indicated 
todays polling is the first time the conservatives have faced 
voters since the imposition april 1 of the socalled poll tax an 
unpopular per capita assessment by local governments that replaced 
a propertybased levy 
at stake are some 5000 seats on local councils ranging from big 
regional cities to english country districts 
a rout would increase speculation that the party may try to dump 
mrs thatcher this autumn the last realistic chance before the 
next general election in 1991 or 1992 
in midterm the government aims to hold what it has this we 
shall do conservative party chairman kenneth baker said 
wednesday night 
but computer forecasts based on opinion polls showed the 
conservatives on course to lose up to 350 seats about onefourth 
of the seats they are defending 
among the 5000 seats being contested labor holds about 2500 
the tories 1500 and centrists or independents the rest 
labor runs 97 of the 201 local councils the conservatives 60 
and the centrist social and liberal democratic party 18 in the 
others no party has overall control 
the economy plays a big role in the election inflation is 
nearly 9 percent and interest rates at 15 percent have sent home 
loans soaring 
a computer forecast based on a market opinion and research 
international sounding for londons prothatcher sunday times 
showed labor on course to wrest control of 24 local councils 
including nine from the tories 
the poll of a sample of 1887 voters gave labor 53 percent 
support the conservatives 31 percent and the fading centrists 6 
percent 
a poll for the independent on sunday showed labor on 51 percent 
compared to the tories 37 and 7 percent for the centrists 
as the bad news piled up thatcher aides hinted this week the 
poll tax may be amended 
the poll tax will never be fair commented labor party 
leader neil kinnock it cannot be amended it must be got rid of 
even if it means the prime minister going down with her own 
flagship 
critics call the tax inherently unfair because the countrys 
richest man pays the same as his gardener 
under the old local tax system only the countrys 17 million 
homeowners paid a property tax the new tax is levied against every 
adult some 38 million people with rebates for the 95 million 
poorest 
like the property taxes the new tax is supposed to raise nearly 
10 billion to pay a portion of the cost of local services 
including education the police garbage collection and subsidized 
housing

if you need to check the latest program at 
londons royal opera house or just want to natter a bit with cousin 
george your fingers will have to do a little more walking 
beginning sunday 
us callers must add a 7 or an 8 to the string of 
numbers it takes to complete such transatlantic calls 
that means a call or fax to the american embassy in london will 
require dialing 011 the international code 44 united kingdom 
country code 71 or 81 the new london area codes plus the 
sevendigit number 
a call to the embassy would look like this 01144714999000 
previously us callers dialed 0114414999000 
british telecom says the 71 area code will be assigned to inner 
london including trafalgar square and the financial district 
while the 81 area code will be used for numbers in outer london 
such as heathrow and wimbley 
if youre in london youll have to dial either 071 or 081 if 
you call from one area code to another 
british telecom said the change will double to 10 million 
londons supply of phone numbers without the new area codes the 
number pool would have been exhausted within the year 
the united kingdom is the most frequently called overseas 
destination from the united states with 713 million calls in 1988 
or 195433 calls per day the federal communication commission 
said 
west germany was second with 40 million calls followed by japan 
with 326 million 
the demand for additional numbers is due to increased use of fax 
machines londons growing role as a communications center and the 
fact that each extension at a business is given a directdial 
number british telecom said

rather than sit home on prom night or 
settle for some geek she didnt even like twyla blankenship of 
thorne bay alaska found a date 1000 miles away 
one of six graduates in the class of 90 in her village of 450 
residents she advertised through her advanced english class using 
a satellite educational network that links students in 30 school 
systems nationwide she said she wanted a date with a sense of 
humor who also looked good in a tuxedo 
out of several responses she picked dustin wambeke a senior 
and football star in freeman about 15 miles southeast of spokane 
the funny thing was that all this started out as a joke she 
said now that its going to happen well im getting kind of 
nervous 
blankenship has spent 300 on a roundtrip ticket for wambeke 
who on friday will drive to seattle fly by jet to ketchikan then 
take a 25minute ride by float plane to thorne bay on the 
southeastern coast of prince of wales island 
this is out of my own money too she said i may have to 
starve at college but this is something i wanted to do 
i guess im kind of adventurous wambeke said im looking 
at this as an excellent opportunity to meet a nice person and see 
another part of the country 
what made the date possible was school in the sky an 
educational program established four years ago in spokane it uses 
a satellite telecommunications to beam advanced course work to 
students in remote schools 
the courses broadcast mondays through thursdays include 
collegelevel japanese spanish calculus and english homework is 
sent by mail or fax to spokane 
kids from small schools tend to think that theyre from the 
smallest and hickiest places on earth said penny cooper who 
teaches advanced english on the network this gives them a chance 
to talk with others from small towns and discover that maybe 
theyre not so bad off after all 
said thorn bay school principal mike walker little did we 
know that when we agreed to offer the satellite courses for kids 
that it could be used as a dating service

washn intelligence community 
 
q well beyond that sir is there at any point in any sense 
as weve heard you say many times you want gorbachev and 
perestroika to survive that you are structuring your program to 
assist him in any way shape or form that thats why youre toeing 
this very difficult line between lithuania and moscow 
a ive expressed a my keen interest in seeing perestroika 
succeed gorbachev is the architect of perestroika gorbachev 
conducted the affairs of the soviet union with great restraint as 
poland and czechoslovakia and the gdr achieved their and other 
countries achieved their independence but you cant build the 
foreign policy of a country on the presence of an individual 
you can build it on ideas you can build it how do you 
facilitate the change toward democracy and freedom whether its in 
the countries where thats taken place or where in the countries 
where it hasnt taken place 
and so i would say i salute the man for what he has done i 
think hes under extraordinary pressure at home particularly on 
the economy and i do from time to time worry about a takeover that 
will set back the whole process but i have no evidence to support 
the thesis that you know the incident or the time frame that you 
asked about 
 
q or any other 
a or any other in any other time frame yeah 
 
q mr president 
a yeah anne 
 
q mr president its been nearly a year since the tiananmen 
square massacre can you point to anything in the last year in your 
policies that have improved the situation there after a year of 
trying to head off severe sanctions and keep the rhetoric down 
a oh several things ive already mentioned them and id 
repeat you know fulbright and peace corps and some of these 
matters but im disappointed ive said that publicly before and 
i am because i would like to think there would be a more vigorous 
response 
i was pleased that they lifted martial law in tibet the other 
day so there are some things that are happening that are going in 
the right direction but overall im disappointed 
and yet preserving a relationship with the peoples republic of 
china in the broad global context is important and so i have no 
apologies i have no feeling that i took the wrong path 
i mean we did by executive action what everything that the 
congress would have done by legislative action everything and so 
there wasnt any substantive difference with the congress on this 
and so i but but look ill express a certain disappointment 
because id like to see more action more things happen that really 
move the whole process forward 
 
q can i follow up on that do you have anything in mind other 
than expressing disappointment to move things along 
a well ive weve got some diplomacy in mind 
 
q mr president do you think that your proposal on nuclear 
weapons in europe will be enough for the soviet union to accept a 
reunified germany within nato 
a our policy on what 
 
q your change on nuclear weapons in europe will that 
a you mean on the lance followon 
 
q would it be enough for the soviet union to accept a unified 
germany 
a i think theyre going to accept it because thats the right 
thing to have happen and i want to see that determined by the 
alliance and keep the solid alliance position 
and i want to see the soviets understand that it is in their 
interest for a us presence in their interest for an expanded 
nato in their interest on a united germany to be inside that 
expanded nato 
weve got to get back to some of these back benches or im going 
to catch it 
cross talk among reporters 
you can hear the enthusiasm for that go ahead 
 
q mr president 
a why dont you move to the back and ask the question will 
you laughter 
 
q mr president the soviets seem to be backpedaling in both 
start on the cruise missiles and some of the things we think they 
agreed to on troop levels on cfe 
are you concerned about this and whats your assessment now of 
the prospects for both a start treaty and a cfe treaty this year 
a were going to have hustle were going to have to hustle 
and theyre going to have to come forward but i dont want to say 
were not going to get a cfe agreement and i dont want to say 
were not going to get the principles of a start agreement locked 
in and thats what id like to see happen 
and the summit thats coming up serves as some incentive for 
that to take place

protests which have paralyzed vital export industries prime 
minister kang younghoon said south koreas slumping economy was at 
stake 
the government is facing the worst crisis since the 
inauguration of president roh taewoo in 1988 kang said rohs 
inauguration followed months of violent protests against his 
authoritarian predecessor

president bush said thursday that protesting 
students may be right that his wifes recognition comes from his 
success but declared these young women can have a lot to learn 
from barbara bush 
she herself said look i know why im privileged to be able 
to serve in this visible fashion shes not trying to be something 
shes not the american people love her because shes something she 
is and stands for something bush said at a news conference 
bush said he and the first lady do not object to the protest of 
wellesley college students who oppose her as a june 1 graduation 
speaker on the grounds that her recognition is due to her marriage 
the president said mrs bush herself acknowledges her ability to 
serve in a number of areas stems from the fact that shes married 
to the president of the united states 
but i think these young women can have a lot to learn from 
barbara bush and from her unselfishness and from her advocacy of 
literacy and being a good mother and a lot of other things he 
said 
asked whether there is merit in the wellesley students argument 
that her accomplishments are related largely to being his wife 
bush drew groans from reporters when he quipped i cant have an 
argument with that 
but he said in a serious vein 
she isnt concerned that 125 students feel that way and i 
think theyll learn a lot from her 
a petition at the womens college said mrs bush should not be 
honored at commencement because she has gained recognition 
through the achievements of her husband which contradicts what we 
have been taught over our years at wellesley 
in an interview with a group of newspapers wednesday mrs bush 
said theyre 21 years old and theyre looking at life from that 
perspective i dont disagree with what theyre looking at 
mrs bush dropped out of smith college in 1944 to marry bush 
but for a parttime job as a newlywed mrs bush has never had a 
salaried job devoting her life instead to raising their five 
children and to community volunteerism 
for many years she has been an outspoken proponent of literacy 
programs and as first lady has spoken out for such causes as the 
homeless and aids programs 
they may change their minds a little bit she said wednesday 
of the students 
i hope they wont opt not to have families and i hope they 
wont opt not to be great parents i dont care who you are the 
best job you do in life is raise your children mrs bush said

azt the only drug that has extended the lives 
of adults with aids has been approved as a treatment for children 
with the disease the food and drug administration said thursday 
new labeling outlines dosage recommendations for patients 3 
months to 12 years old who have aids or show symptoms of advanced 
infection with the virus that causes it 
the drug is now officially considered to be a standard therapy 
for children with aids health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan said in a statement 
that he said should encourage insurance companies to make 
reimbursements for pediatric use of azt 
a total of 2192 children have been diagnosed with aids and 
1182 have died according to the centers for disease control 
the fda has been under pressure to approve azt for children 
especially from parents of sick children for whom there has been 
virtually no other effective treatment an advisory committee of 
outside experts voted 71 march 30 to recommend the pediatric 
labeling 
while azt has extended the lives of people with aids it also 
has caused significant side effects 
the drug can inhibit the production of red blood cells and may 
reduce white blood cell counts to the point where doses must be 
discontinued to avoid infections 
the fda said physicians could have prescribed azt for children 
without formal approval but were reluctant to do so because of 
concerns that side effects might be more severe in young patients 
clinical trials involving more than 200 children indicate the side 
effects are similar to those experienced by adults the agency said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious disease that 
attacks the bodys immune system rendering it incapable of 
resisting other diseases and infections the virus most often is 
spread through close contact with blood blood products or semen 
as of march 31 aids had been diagnosed in 128319 americans of 
whom 61 percent or 78341 have died since june 1 1981 according 
to the cdc 
no one is known to have recovered from aids

the national assembly today approved a bill that 
would bar anyone who provokes racial hatred or violence from 
holding elected office and government jobs for five years 
the legislation aimed at the extremeright national front 
party was passed by the assembly 307265 after an allnight debate 
and now goes to the senate where it can be revised before being 
returned to the lower house 
it must be signed by president francois mitterand to become law 
jeanmarie le pen the leader of the national front said the 
bill was without precedence in a western democracy le pen 
watched from the public gallery as the sole national front deputy 
struggled without success to introduce 80 amendments to block or 
water down the measure 
an alliance between the socialist and communist parties which 
control a majority of seats in the assembly pushed the bill 
through while most of the conservative opposition voted against it 
the bill bans those found guilty by a court of racial 
discrimination or inciting racial hatred or violence from running 
for office holding a government post or sitting on a jury for five 
years 
the bill also makes it a misdemeanor to deny the existence of 
crimes against humanity committed by the nazis during world war ii 
le pen won global notoriety in 1987 by terming the deaths of 6 
million jews in the world war ii death camps a detail of 
history 
because we are all democrats le pen has never been denied his 
freedom of expression prime minister michel rocard said before 
opening the debate but for the same reason we cant accept that 
he can hold out these racist and antisemitic proposals without 
penalty 
the proposal also requires that magazines newspapers and 
broadcasting outlets provide rightofreply space to victims of 
racially defamatory stories 
conservative deputies argued that the measure unnecessarily 
tampered with an 1881 law guaranteeing freedom of the press and 
accused the communists of opportunism 
at a news conference before the debate le pen said the law 
violated democratic traditions 
the french parliament is being called on to institute a new 
penalty the civil and political death of citizens guilty of 
opposing immigration and defending the french identity he said 
the bills approval comes after a government commission in march 
said that racism particularly against north african immigrants is 
spreading in france 
le pen a former paratrooper founded the national front in 
1972 it has built its following by opposing immigration the 
countrys most explosive social issue le pen advocates expelling 
the 34 million moslem immigrants living in france 
the fronts support is strongest among white voters in areas 
where there are large numbers of north african and black immigrants 
the party once held 35 seats in the assembly and captured 14 
percent of the vote in the 1988 presidential elections it lost 
most of its seats due to electoral reforms

objected to mrs bush as commencement speaker

merit to their argument that mrs bushs accomplishments are 
largely related to her marriage to yourself laughter and 
secondly do you 
a i cant make an argument with that 
press laughs then groans 
 
q are you personally offended by their hesitation to 
a yes and mrs bush herself has put it that her ability to 
serve as i think a terribly effective point of light stems 
from the fact that shes married to the president of the united 
states 
but i think that these young women can have a lot to learn from 
barbara bush and from her unselfishness and from her advocacy of 
literacy and of being a good mother and a lot of other things 
and so i i have no objection 
as bar said yesterday she isnt concerned that 125 students 
feel this way and i think theyll learn a lot from her and she 
wants to go and shes not concerned by it at all 
but she herself said look i know why i am privileged to be 
able to serve in this visible fashion shes not trying to be

something she is and stands for something 
 
q mr president do you think that the relations with mexico

the vice president incidentally did a very yeah very good 
job in explaining the policy to president salinas himself our 
attorney general has worked very closely with the mexicans we have 
had superb cooperation from mexico in fighting drugs 
outstanding and so i salute them 
but yes there was some misunderstanding here and i have told

misunderstanding with mexico we dont need it we need continued 
cooperation and were getting continued 
 
q but what of the future are they going to continue going 
into mexico the agents of the united states 
a thats a matter for mexico to decide and if mexico wanted to 
have some people work with our people here and that could help the 
fight against narcotics i would be very open to that if it fit 
into our fight against drugs 
ive got time for two more one in the middle and then sarah 
you get the last one yes 
 
q mr president if bill seidman has done such an outstanding 
job at the fdic in overseeing the savings and loan bailout why

washn about it 
 
 
q mr president is this the last question 
a this is the last one 
 
q sir 
a youve been a very good sport yes 
 
q thank you very much i want to know if youre going to 
ask permission from congress to send us troops into peru and 
build take 35 million of our much needed money right now and 
build a military installation down there for us to train their 
troops to fight drug cartels 
a to send us troops in there to do that 
 
q are you going to ask congress for permission to do that 
a i have not considered asking congress for that but if peru 
if theres some training role that will facilitate the fight 
against drugs i would be willing to consider it but i have no 
intention of asking congress at this moment for anything of that 
nature 
 
q do you feel now that you have the authority to send to 
build this installation which has been reported that you were 
planning to build down there in peru 
a just a minute i need expert advice on this 
the president pauses to confer offmike with brent scowcroft 
to ms mcclendon youre talking about building a facility 
 
q yes sir my understanding is that youre going to build a 
facility 
a to gen scowcroft what facility what facility are we 
talking about 
to ms mcclendon well have to get back to you laughter 
you see the kind of advice im getting here laughter 
no really im sorry i just dont know about any facility but 
we i do know that the concept of training is a very valid 
concept i dont think it requires approval from the united states 
congress but if the law requires me to ask if we do something 
thats going to require that along the lines here then id i 
would ask 
i were not trying to get around congress we work very 
cooperatively with them 
i have to go 
 
q one more 
a no i cant do i cant all right one more no not you 
laughter 
 
q earlier you dropped a hint about the united states helping to 
obtain the release of some iranian hostages whos got them and 
how could you help 
a no these were diplomats these were four iranian diplomats 
that were taken in lebanon in 1982 and they the iranians dont 
feel that theyve had a full accounting of these people in fact i 
think they still hope that those people are alive 
the best information we have as an outside party to all of 
this is that they are not still alive 
but my point is if iran feels that way and the families of 
these four people feel that way this is something where we should 
use every asset we have to to to disperse the lack of 
information and to bring them the facts if we can 
and see this is something they feel strongly about theyve 
mentioned it to us several different times and heres something we 
can do without there being any violating our policy 
its something id like to do and i think they would consider 
this a gesture of goodwill so were trying very hard again i 
wish i felt that the answer we gave them would be different than 
the one because theres a human equation here there is some 
suffering here on families in iran and so its a you know 
cross talk 
 
q sir are you doing something in this specific case 
a huh 
 
q youve spoken about the things that you could do are you 
doing something in this case 
a yeah were trying to find but its very hard to do

president bush said thursday that he sometimes 
worries about the possibility of a military takeover in the soviet 
union that would unseat mikhail gorbachev and set back the east 
blocs stride toward freedom 
he saluted gorbachev as the architect of perestroika and for 
exercising great restraint as poland east germany and other 
warsaw pact countries shifted toward democracy 
however he said at a news conference our foreign policy is 
not based on just mr gorbachev 
bush denied he was withholding support for lithuanian 
independence because of a desire to see gorbachev and his reforms 
succeed 
i salute the man for what he has done i think hes under 
extraordinary pressure at home particularly on the economy bush 
said i do from time to time worry about a takeover that will 
set back the whole process 
the president said reports that gorbachev was under pressure 
from his military to backpedal from possible arms concessions on 
longrange nuclear missiles and submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
were a matter of some concern 
bush announced he was canceling a planned modernization of 
shortrange lance nuclear missiles aimed at the warsaw pact from 
western europe and scrapping plans to modernize us nuclear 
artillery shells in europe 
im not doing these things just to put at ease the soviet 
military he said but i must tell you i sometimes do worry 
about the military resurgence of some kind inside the soviet 
union 
one reporter asked about a report that gorbachev was close to 
being overthrown feb 25 when large demonstrations were staged in 
moscow 
i was not advised of that by the intelligence community 
bush said 
on the lithuanian secession crisis bush said we cant place 
this on a youhavetochoosebetweengorbachevorlandsbergis 
referring to the baltic republics president vytautas landsbergis 
ive expressed my keen interest in seeing perestroika suceed 
gorbachev is the architect of perestroika bush said gorbachev 
conducted the affairs of the soviet union with great restraint as 
poland and czechoslovakia and east germany and other countries 
achieved their independence 
but you cant build a foreign policy of a country on the 
presence of an individual you can build it on ideas 
on a lighter note bush said gorbachev shouldnt be too 
concerned about the jeers he heard at tuesdays may day parade in 
red square 
he ought to come join some of the parades i go to around 
here bush said 
look thats the fruits of democracy hes just learning

optimistic government and african 
national congress leaders said thursday they were making progress 
in clearing the way for fullscale negotiations on ending 
whiteminority rule 
the two sides issued a joint communique after a second day of 
talks and said both leaders expressed satisfaction with the 
progress achieved thus far and would continue tomorrow to work 
toward bridging differences 
the delegations led by president fw de klerk and anc deputy 
president nelson mandela met amid tight security at a suburban 
estate they are the first formal talks between the government and 
anc since the black nationalist group was founded 78 years ago 
the first day of talks wednesday concentrated on a general 
discussion of the issues each side regards as obstacles the 
communique said 
thursdays meeting was devoted to a widerranging discussion 
and penetrating analysis of these specific issues in an attempt to 
identify the differences more clearly in the hope that proposals 
could emerge on how to bridge these differences said the 
communique 
the talks were scheduled to end friday evening but the argus 
newspaper in cape town said they were likely to be continued at a 
later date because agreement probably would not be reached on all 
issues by friday 
the delegations are seeking to remove obstacles to formal 
negotiations on a new constitution that would give the countrys 
black majority a voice in national affairs 
thabo mbeki a senior member of the anc delegation expressed 
optimism when he spoke to reporters during a lunch break thursday 
when all of us departed wednesdays talks the general 
feeling was that not only is movement forward necessary but that 
it is possible said mbeki 
we had people sitting in that room who are perfectly 
reasonable and we are all committed to finding a solution he 
said 
sources of the governing national party who refused to be 
identified said the government also was confident the talks would 
lead to fullscale negotiations on changing the constitution 
as a precondition to those talks the anc is demanding the 
government end a nearly 4yearold state of emergency release all 
political prisoners and allow antigovernment activists to return 
from exile 
the government has countered with demands that the anc renounce 
its armed struggle and help stop a wave of violence that has 
claimed hundreds of lives in recent months 
in an outline of the ancs position carried by newspapers 
thursday anc spokesman patrick lekota stressed that the group 
which was legalized by de klerk in february was making every 
effort to clear the way for constitutional negotiations 
he said the majority of south africans were looking to the talks 
to find a peaceful solution to the countrys racial divisions 
while holding grimly to our views we shall do everything 
short of selling out to help the government remove the obstacles to 
a political settlement he wrote 
both the anc and government have come under fire for the talks 
radical black groups that say only force can end apartheid are 
angry at the anc for talking to the government and white extremist 
groups oppose the government meeting with blacks 
the national party stressed the government was negotiating from 
a position of strength the government party officials said would 
insist on a wide range of guarantees to safeguard the interests of 
the countrys 5 million whites and other minorities 
these guarantees would include a parliamentary chamber where 
whites would have a legislative veto and retention of afrikaans as 
an official language the party officials said 
the anc has demanded a oneperson onevote democratic system 
with no special rights for any racial group it also wants a 
redistribution of wealth to aid millions of impoverished blacks

the national football league criticized the 
district of columbia on thursday for a planned lottery that would 
allow residents to bet on professional teams and said it will 
consider suing the city 
nfl spokesman joe browne said the league opposes gambling 
legalized or otherwise and would review the lottery and explore 
its options including litigation 
with increased betting on sports the nature of fans would 
change and they would become more concerned about winning bets than 
seeing their team win a game said browne 
the citys lottery and charitable games control board 
tentatively approved the plan wednesday night it would have to be 
approved by city lawyers and passed again by the lottery board 
following a 30day comment period before it could be started 
although a similar sports lottery is under suit in oregon the 
districts would be the first in the nation to allow wagering by 
residents of an area on their regions home teams 
the nfl say such legalized gambling would make it easier to fix 
games unlawfully makes money from their private enterprise and 
could turn fans against their home teams 
browne said for example washington redskins fans may jeer the 
football team as it protects a threepoint lead in a game in which

dot hills american legion marching band 
has the kind of john philip sousa style that would make any 
american hometown proud 
but planning their musical peace tour of the soviet union took 
something more perseverance and a very special woman said 
the rev nicholas ciccone a roman catholic priest who plays the 
cymbals 
dorothy hill the 74yearold bandleader everyone calls dot is 
that woman shes the heart of the 70member allmale band and the 
hustle behind its 10day trip to the soviet union where theyve 
been invited to march in moscows annual victory day parade 
the may 9 parade commorates the soviet victory over nazi germany 
the band leaves friday for moscow and will go to leningrad 
before returning home may 12 
the fact that the soviets were willing to permit us to come on 
such an important day says to me theyre ready for peace said 
mrs hill 
she has been told by soviet officials that her band will be the 
first american band to march in the parade through red square 
and when we do well be playing god bless america and 
singing peace in capital letters she said 
ive seen three wars in my lifetime and i just dont want 
another generation going through it said mrs hill a world war 
ii coast guard veteran i wanted to make a peace move now 
since everyone loves a parade she reasoned how better to 
promote peace than through music 
it took nearly three years but mrs hill got her wish 
she says officials at the soviet peace committee which oversees 
national parades were a bit skeptical when she contacted them 
theyd ask you government and id say no im just dot 
from the waltham band 
she called out of the blue having dialed up operator after 
operator before finding one that spoke enough english to help her 
find out how to reach the people who could help her pull off the 
mission 
the peace committee officials kept telling me they were trying 
to get rid of the image of tanks and power and come up with a happy 
image mrs hill said at the bands final rehearsal this week 
which drew about 150 boosters 
they kept reminding me that our bands are happy bands she 
said 
the joseph p hill american legion band named for mrs hills 
late husband has that big bold brassy sound you want to hear on 
the fourth of july 
ranging from ages 17 to 82 the band members are fathers and 
sons doctors and lawyers engineers cooks and landscapers they 
are veterans of wars in europe japan korea and vietnam 
but weve all got dot and shes got the perseverance and 
faith said ciccone who everyone in this workingclass boston 
suburb knows as father nick 
band members who have watched reform roll through the soviet 
union and eastern europe said the time was right for their peace 
move 
this is our chance to show our two governments that people are 
the same everywhere said brian mulcahy who is as excited about 
the trip to moscow as he was during a 1984 st patricks day march 
in his ancestral ireland 
even john dow the resident curmudgeon who is bringing his 
wheelchair and alto horn to moscow let a little smile slip 
i dont think its going to change the world the feisty 
septuagenarian said but it cant hurt to see the sights and make 
a few friends

president bush said thursday that he has 
invited congressional leaders to weekend talks to discuss how to 
avoid a looming political standoff over the 1991 federal budget 
congress two top democrats showed little enthusiasm for the 
sunday session while the reactions of other lawmakers ranged from 
enthusiasm to rejection 
weve got to move forward and ive got to find a way to do 
that bush said of the budget process which has crept slowly 
until recently 
bush extended the invitations during a week in which the house 
and the senate budget committee have approved separate 
democraticwritten budgets that would slash the presidents defense 
programs by about 10 billion his own budget proposed in january 
has not even been put to a vote on capitol hill 
now there seems to be some action so it seemed to me to be a 
good time to sit down and talk process and see where we go now 
bush said at a news conference 
congress has long since missed the april 15 deadline the law 
sets for completion of next years budget the 1991 fiscal year 
begins oct 1 
but the president said the talks would not address any 
substance and that bargaining would not take place 
were not into a negotiation said bush were talking 
process 
lawmakers and congressional aides speculated that sundays 
session would focus on the basic question of whether serious budget 
negotiations could proceed in the future 
the first step is whether further discussions can be 
initiated and whether or not they can be fruitful said house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
the invitation follows administration warnings that the 
economys poor performance in past months means more budgetcutting 
will be needed next year 
the administration now predicts 45 billion to 57 billion in 
savings will have to be found in the 1991 budget bushs budget 
said in january that 37 billion in cuts would be needed the 
grammrudman law requires next years deficit to not surpass 64 
billion 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash would say little about 
what the meeting might accomplish 
theres obviously going to be a willingness to hear what the 
president has to say he said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine was even more 
tightlipped declining to even acknowledge that he has been 
invited to the session 
the administration and congressional republicans have been 
saying for months that only negotiations between the white house 
and congress will truly reduce the deficit next year 
but democrats have been split mitchell and senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn have been cool toward the 
idea of talks foley and panetta have said budget talks with the 
administration will be necessary 
panetta called the sunday meeting the beginning of a process 
of discussions with the white house 
but he said bush must agree to negotiate on possible tax 
increases for talks to succeed bush promised during his 
presidential campaign to not raise taxes but in recent months 
administration officials have said they are willing to discuss all 
options for reducing the deficit 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting ways 
and means committee said he thought the talks are a great idea 
i think they could give us more direction about what the 
president wants to do about the deficit he said 
others however expressed disdain for the idea many members of 
congress have resented the budget negotiations of the past few 
years arguing that they end up freezing most lawmakers out of the 
fiscal process 
it eliminates many of the cumbersome clumsy aspects of 
democracy and replaces them with the efficiency of an edict said 
rep richard durbin dill a member of the house budget 
committee king george iii would have loved it

the veterans affairs department lost as much 
as 392 million in one year by failing to collect from private 
insurance companies for health care according to the general 
accounting office 
the report released this week by the congressional auditing 
agency says the va missed collecting from 55 million to 392 
million in socalled third party reimbursements in 1988 
the department spends about 10 billion a year on health care 
for veterans including those with private insurance congress in 
1986 gave the government the right to collect from private insurers 
as a means of cutting the deficit 
the report did note however collections have greatly exceeded 
the costs of collecting the money in the 1988 fiscal year the 
report said the va spent 8 million to collect about 100 million 
from insurers 
the report said va centers could increase collections 
significantly if they used better methods to identify insured 
veterans and bill insurers and committed more people and time to 
collections 
even when centers identified insured veterans they did not 
always bill insurers the report said citing inadequate controls 
and manual billing systems 
the report said many veterans are confused or afraid that 
disclosures about insurance would jeopardize their admittance to 
the centers 
the veterans department operates 172 hospitals 233 outpatient 
clinics and 119 nursing homes the hospitals recorded 11 million 
admissions and 20 million outpatient visits 
the report was based on collections at six va medical centers 
albany ny bay pines fla martinsburg wva minneapolis 
seattle and west los angeles calif 
the report was requested by sen frank h murkowski rala the 
ranking minority member on the senate veterans affairs committee 
the va in its response acknowledged problems and said it was 
taking a number of steps to address them 
in its 1991 budget proposal the department said it would 
introduce legislation to improve and expand its thirdparty 
collection activities

president bush scrapped plans thursday for 
newer and more powerful battlefield nuclear weapons in europe and 
called for a nato summit to rewrite political and military strategy 
for a new era in history 
as democracy comes to eastern europe and soviet troops return 
home there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest 
range bush said 
his decision canceling modernization of the lance missile 
amounted to a recognition of political realities both in europe and 
in congress 
west germany where most of the new weapons would be based had 
fiercely opposed the deployment since the warheads would be 
targeted on their countrymen in east germany 
congress doubting that the new missiles would ever be 
installed had balked at bushs request for 112 million for 
modernization 
bush made his announcement at a wideranging news conference 
during which he also said i sometimes do worry that military 
hardliners in the soviet union might oust president mikhail s 
gorbachev and try to reverse democratic reforms in eastern europe 
it was bushs most direct statement ever about gorbachevs grip 
on power 
bush said gorbachev is under extraordinary pressure at home 
because of unrest over lithuanias drive for independence and the 
ailing soviet economy 
in a lighter moment bush defended his wife barbara against 
complaints by wellesley college students who oppose her as their 
graduation speaker 
he said the students may be right in saying her recognition 
comes from his success but declared these young women can have a 
lot to learn from barbara bush anyway 
bush welcomed statements from lithuanian president vytautis 
landsbergis indicating a willingness to compromise with the 
soviets i think that is very very positive andlets hope it 
goes forward bush said 
later he met with lithuanian prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene at the white house 
on other subjects 
responding to questions about the freeing of two american 
hostages in lebanon bush said the united states could not claim 
credit for their release 
there were no behindthescenes negotiations that will come 
out that show that we pulled this off said bush who previously 
has applauded syria and iran for their roles 
the president said he would be willing to make any gesture of 
appreciation to iran that would not be viewed as negotiating for 
the release of hostages 
bush announced he had invited top congressional leaders to a 
meeting sunday in an effort to move forward the budget process 
the full house and the senate budget committee have passed 
democratic budget versions that cut defense spending far more than 
bush sought 
im not going to sit here and do nothing bush said but he 
added were not into a negotiation were talking process 
he said he was not trying to oust the man who oversees the 
nations beleaguered savings and loan industry l william seidman 
chief of the federal deposit insurance corp 
he said seidman did not want to complete his term and had urged 
bush to replace him with william taylor acting director of the 
resolution trust corp 
as for weapons in europe the cancellation of modernization 
plans has been in the works for months following the collapse of 
the berlin wall and the sweep of democracy throughout eastern 
europe 
the revolutionary changes transforming europe are moving us 
from the postwar era to a new era in history beyond containment 
of warsaw pact forces bush said 
he said the 16member nato alliance should meet in late june or 
early july to launch a wideranging nato strategy review for the 
transformed europe of the 1990s the president is to meet with 
gorbachev in washington may 30june 3 
specifically bush announced he was dropping plans to deploy a 
more powerful shortrange lance missile to replace launchers for 
700 aging warheads based mostly in west germany 
all of the new weapons would have been targeted on east germany 
which is moving toward a swift merger with west germany the new 
missiles would have had a range of about 250 miles compared with 
about 75 miles for the existing lance 
bush also said he was canceling further modernization of us 
nuclear artillery shells in europe 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
called bushs announcement a very important step and i agree 
with him 
echoing those comments sen claiborne pell dri chairman of 
the foreign relations committee said the primary target of 
weapons of this range was east germany now about to be part of a 
united germany and it had become intolerable to maintain them for 
their original purpose or to pursue plans for costly and pointless 
replacements

it drizzled when kazimiera prunskiene came to 
visit president bush on thursday but she unfurled no umbrella a 
symbol since munich of shame and appeasement 
her leader back home had already invoked that imagery 
last week after bush backed away from plans to impose economic 
sanctions on the soviet union for its failure to respect 
lithuanias secession vytautas landsbergis president of the 
breakaway baltic republic said the decision amounted to 
appeasement 
landsbergis said it reminded him of the 1938 meeting in munich 
at which neville chamberlain the british prime minister famous for 
carrying a black umbrella met with adolph hitler and agreed to let 
hitler take over czechoslovkia in the interest of peace in our 
time 
munich has been a symbol of sellout ever since munich and 
umbrellas 
the prime minister of the besieged newly declared republic of 
lithuania made it clear wherever she went that she had come to 
put mikhail gorbachev on the spot not george bush 
mrs prunskiene said she had no intention of telling a big power 
like america how to conduct its affairs sen alfonse damato 
rny called her statement artful 
she sat at a table covered in red felt reading a handwritten 
statement in a firm voice to the us commission on security and 
cooperation in europe a human rights watchdog panel of members of 
congress and lowlevel administration officials 
her message gorbachev would be strengthened by the achievement 
of a democratic lithuania it would help him overcome the 
reactionary forces which oppose not only independence for the 
baltic states but his reforms as well 
you do not have to choose between lithuania and gorbachev 
she said 
but there was iron in her message too 
even the worlds darling she said of gorbachev does not 
have the monopolistic right to decide the fate of other nations 
lithuania she said would be free with his consent or without 
it with his economic embargo or without it 
she spoke facing the american flag and the green gold and red 
stripes of the old lithuanian flag 
an american woman of lithuanian extraction sensing the need 
had telephoned the commission and volunteered to provide the flag 
it had not been unfurled in official halls in washington in some 
time 
mrs prunskiene made the most of a visit to washington and with 
bush that the white house stressed was private and unofficial 
she went on early morning television she breakfasted with the 
house foreign affairs committee and lunched with the senate foreign 
relations committee she scheduled a meeting with the editors of 
the washington post and the leaders of the conservative heritage 
foundation and dinner with a group of newspaper columnists 
before leaving capitol hill for her meeting with bush she 
stepped onto the floor of the senate which suspended business and 
applauded her 
sen jesse helms rsc took her by the hand and introduced 
her to seven senate pages in their blue suits and white shirts she 
shook their hands 
an economist and teacher she once had been a rising communist 
member of the ussr supreme soviet in february she quit the party 
the next month lithuania declared itself free and she joined the 
secessionist government 
it fell to a liberal democrat rep edward j markey of 
massachusetts to disagree with mrs prunskiene at the commission 
hearing and support the bush policy of caution 
his was the only dissent heard 
tightlipped he said much more than lithuania was at stake 
gorbachev he said should not be punished for the sins of stalin 
he said under gorbachev the berlin wall has fallen thousands of 
jews have left the soviet union free governments have taken root 
in the old satellite nations 
it ill behooves us to lecture you on the subject of 
independence markey told mrs prunskiene by the same token 
it ill behooves lithuania to declare its independence and then 
charge the west with appeasement and another munich

egyptian president hosni mubarak said 
thursday he wants to help end the feud between syria and iraq and 
persuade syrias president to attend an arab summit in the iraqi 
capital 
mubarak also said president hafez assad of syria was willing to 
meet with his main foe plo leader yasser arafat 
mubarak spoke to foreign reporters before his final meeting with 
assad it was the first trip to syria by an egyptian head of state 
in 12 years 
in baghdad foreign minister tariq aziz said iraqs president 
will invite assad to attend the arab summit 
but assad said in an interview with egyptian journalists he was 
surprised that holding the summit in baghdad appeared to be a 
foregone conclusion without more discussion among arab leaders 
assad said the meeting should be held in a location that is not 
disputed egypts middle east news agency reported 
the feud between syria and iraq one of the most bitter in the 
arab world has been partly responsible for delays in convening a 
summit to discuss soviet jewish emigration to israel 
we had a lot of discussion yesterday but still there are so 
many points which need efforts not only from egypt but from all 
the friends in the whole region so as to narrow the gap between 
syria and iraq mubarak said 
the egyptian news agency quoted assad as saying president 
mubarak assured us more than once about his concern about good 
relations between syria and iraq but he and many other arab 
brothers appreciate that the gap is still wide between the two 
countries and may need more time and effort maybe time will help 
things improve 
arab diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said mubarak brought a paper to damascus suggesting a meeting 
of the syrian and iraqi foreign ministers in cairo 
tariq aziz the iraqi foreign minister said in baghdad that 
saddam would dispatch personal envoys with invitations to all the 
arab leaders next week even though no date has been fixed for the 
summit 
a presidential envoy will visit damascus to hand assad the 
invitation aziz said there were few other indications however 
that the gulf between assad and saddam was really narrowing 
their countries are ruled by rival wings of the arab baath 
socialist party assad supported persian iran in its eightyear war 
with arab iraq saddam provided weapons to lebanons christian gen 
michel aoun in his failed war of liberation against syria and 
its allies 
another major rift in the arab world involves assad and arafat 
mubarak said the syrian president was ready to meet the plo leader 
he has no good relations with yasser arafat yet he will 
welcome arafat if he comes here hes not against that mubarak 
said 
assad and arafat have been feuding for years a major source of 
animosity is the palestinian leaders recognition of israels right 
to exist syria is the only arab state not to have recognized the 
independent palestinian state announced at the palestinian national 
council in november 1988 
palestinian sources in damascus have said previously that arafat 
has set three conditions for traveling to damascus recognition of 
a palestinian state the release of thousands of proarafat 
guerrillas in syrian jails and a pledge not to interfere in 
palestinian affairs 
assad also is the most formidable foe of the jewish state and he 
has said he will build up his armed forces until they reach 
strategic parity with israel 
syrias involvement in any peace process would be necessary for 
durable peace in the region 
asked whether he thought assad would participate in peace 
efforts in concert with egypt mubarak said the crux of the 
whole problem is the palestinian problem if there is an active 
role for the palestinians president hafez assad ill never miss the 
train mubarak said 
cairo and damascus resumed diplomatic ties in december after a 
12year break syria broke relations with egypt shortly after 
thenegyptian president anwar sadat visited jerusalem in november 
1977 sixteen other arab countries also broke relations to protest 
against egypts peace with israel

fifty of the 88 hospitals that closed in 1988 
were in rural communities the government said thursday 
texas had the most closings 29 the department of health and 
human services said alabama was second with seven california 
illinois louisiana missouri and west virginia had five each 
in four of the communities that lost their only hospital 
resident had to travel more than 30 miles for inpatient care cuba 
nm 80 miles metaline falls wash and kearny ariz 50 miles 
and ekalaka mont 36 miles 
the report by the departments inspector general said that the 
reasons hospitals gave for closing were the same as in 1987 when 
69 facilities closed 
those reasons included loss of revenue due to declining 
admissions reduced insurance and government reimbursement rates 
more uncompensated care for the indigent and the uninsured and 
rising costs due to demands for new technology more skilled 
personnel repairs and renovation 
across the board hospitals that shut their doors were 
significantly smaller and had lower occupancy rates than the 
national average said inspector general richard p kusserow 
on the plus side the report said four new hospitals opened in 
1988 and eight that had closed earlier reopened in 1988 
in a related report the american hospital association said 
fewer people were admitted to community hospitals in 1989 than in 
any year since 1973 while outpatient visits rose to a record 308 
million 
total admissions in 1989 were 332 million the association 
said the average occupancy rate was 649 percent 
the association said that as hospitals adapted to the 
outpatienttreatment trend they eliminated 70000 beds 73 
percent of their capacity from 1983 through 1989

president bush on thursday endorsed william 
taylor a lowkey federal reserve veteran to take over what many 
consider the toughest financial job in government boss of the 
savings and loan bailout 
bush told a news conference he is very high on taylor 50 
years old and director of bank supervision for the federal reserve 
board to replace l william seidman as chairman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp and the resolution trust corp 
the president said seidman enthusiastically supports taylor 
as his successor 
seidman suggested the name of bill taylor who were very high 
on to take his responsibilities bush said 
the fdic manages deposit insurance funds for banks and sampls the 
rtc conducts the administrations thrift cleanup 
the president said newspaper reports earlier in the week that he 
had suggested seidman leave were incorrect its his 
initiative bush said i think seidman has conducted himself 
with extraordinary grace and great ability 
neither bush nor seidman has said when the chairman will leave 
but fdic officials expect hell go by late summer or early fall 
that would allow time to prepare a transition and complete an 
ambitious program announced last month to close or sell 140 
insolvent sampls by june 30 
the transition will take place in a very friendly manner when 
i think its the appropriate time seidman said in a telephone 
interview he said hes backing taylor because hes a very 
capable guy hes familiar with the situation and i have a lot of 
confidence in him 
seidman 69 had said for some time that he did not plan to stay 
until his term ends in october 1991 but he had not indicated his 
resignation was imminent 
on tuesday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration would not resist seidmans departure congressional 
democrats said bush should press seidman to stay 
seidman had scored points particularly among democrats for his 
bluntness in revealing the bailouts soaring cost estimates and for 
his willingness to take positions at odds with the administration 
administration officials notably white house chief of staff 
john sununu and deputy treasury secretary john robson were irked 
by his independence 
on the other hand taylor reportedly is wellregarded by 
treasury officials for his lowkey outofthelimelight style 
since midfebruary he has been on leave from the fed serving as 
chief staff officer of a treasury departmentled policy panel 
overseeing the rtc 
taylor has a reputation as a conservative regulator and was one 
of the most vigorous advocates of toughening capital standards in 
the thrift industry he is not expected to match seidmans talent 
for dealing with congress and the public 
i think bill taylor is going into one of the most difficult 
jobs in washington said kenneth guenther executive vice 
president of the independent bankers association of america i 
think hes a very bright able man but no one can match seidmans 
ties with the hill and the press 
beyond the enormous task of directing the disposal of more than 
300 billion in real estate loans and other assets of failed sampls 
taylor will find himself at the center of a clash next year between 
the administration and congress when the two sides try to come up 
with a way to fund a second installment of the bailout 
he also should be an important player in next years debate over 
the reform of federal deposit insurance and the expansion of 
commercial banking into securities underwriting and other financial 
services 
taylor did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
thursday government sources asking not to be named said taylor 
wants the fdicrtc chairmanship considered the nations 
preeminent bank regulatory post the thrift office director serves 
under the treasury secretary but the fdic chairman once appointed 
serves independently and cannot be removed by the president

a childrens advocacy group asked federal 
regulators on thursday to move against tv producers who violate 
stringent rules on advertising in kids programs 
action for childrens television in a filing with the federal 
communications commission said it was prompted by a report that an 
upcoming show video power planned to splice ads into the 
program so seamlessly that kids may not know where the program ends 
and the ads begin 
the wall street journal reported on monday that video power 
a halfhour syndicated show would be hosted by a 14yearold named 
johnny arcade johnny the journal said will rattle off 
news items such as countdowns of top hits in video games 
sandwiched in the minutelong countdowns will be 10second or 
20second commercials without so much as a pause between the news 
and the commercial 
a videogame maker acclaim entertainment has purchased 20 
percent of the shows advertising time the journal said 
anthony williams an acclaim executive told the newspaper 
children change channels during commercials for one thing their 
concentration span is shorter than that of adults this we 
think is a good way for both producer and advertiser to sidestep 
that problem 
attempts to reach acclaim entertainment or t 
of congressional budget office forecasts and 65 billion below the 
administration estimate 
however the new law is still bringing in about as much money as 
predicted because the share paid by individuals has risen slightly 
because of higher than expected wages 
rosen said corporate income taxes accounted for 105 percent of 
all federal receipts last year by 1995 he said corporate 
receipts are expected to account for 114 percent of receipts 
even so cbo director robert d reischauer said corporate taxes 
have failed to keep pace with economic growth 
corporate taxes measured 4 percent of gross national product 
in 1960 by 1986 the amount had declined to 15 percent 
reischauer said 
cbo projects corporate receipts of 111 billion for 1991 which 
would be 19 percent of gnp

britons voted thursday for local councils in the 
first comprehensive opinion test since prime minister margaret 
thatcher now in deep trouble won a third term in 1987 
voters turned out in relatively large numbers during the daylong 
ballot for 201 councils spurred by a national controversy over an 
unpopular new local tax known as the poll tax 
officials said the turnout among the 25 million voters 
registered in the 201 councils contested appeared higher than the 
usual 30 percent to 40 percent in local elections 
opinion polls showed mrs thatchers conservative party which 
has plunged to a record low of more than 20 points behind the labor 
party headed for a drubbing 
according to forecasts from two weekend opinion polls the 
socialists were poised to snatch up to 300 seats from the tories 
or onefourth of the total defended by the governing party 
prime targets for labor included two london boroughs wandsworth 
and westminster where conservative administrations with slender 
majorities have set the lowest poll tax rates in the country 
mrs thatcher has hailed wandsworth charging 243 per adult 
and westminster with a 320 tax as epitomizing good conservative 
government as opposed to highspending laborrun authorities 
the average poll tax levied by local authorities is 580 
onethird above government targets 
defeat in the two narrowly held boroughs would be widely seen as 
a personal humiliation for her 
an overall rout would increase speculation that the 64yearold 
prime minister will stand down or be dumped by the party before 
the next election in 1991 or 1992 
another key labor target is the north england industrial city of 
bradford where a rightwing tory administration with a twoseat 
majority on the 66member council has imposed stringent economies 
problems began a year ago as inflation started rising and the 
governments attempt to curb it by hiking interest rates began 
hurting millions of new homeowners inflation is now headed toward 
10 percent while interest rates are a high 15 percent 
the new tax was imposed april 1 mrs thatcher hoped it would 
turn voters against highspending laborcontrolled authorities 
but instead most families are paying more and blaming the 
government the tax is also perceived as unfair because everyone in 
a district pays the same regardless of income 
the government argues the fuss is largely because under the old 
system of property taxes only the 17 million homeowners paid now 
all 38 million adult britons have to pay with rebates for the 95 
million poorest 
at stake in thursdays elections were some 5000 seats on 
regional authorities ranging from remote islands off northern 
scotland to big cities such as birmingham through english rural 
districts and the 36 boroughs of london 
the authorities run services ranging from education through 
welfare and subsidized housing to street cleaning and garbage 
removal they are funded through a combination of the poll tax 
business taxes and central government grants 
before voting labor held about 2500 of the seats the tories 
1500 and centrists or independents the rest 
labor ran 97 councils the conservatives 60 and the centrist 
social and liberal democratic party 18 in the others no party had 
overall control 
except in london and 12 scottish districts only onethird of 
the council seats were up for election 
the seats being contested thursday were last up for election in 
1986 when labor did well 
in the house of commons on thursday labor party leader neil 
kinnock said losers outnumbered gainers 31 under the new tax 
if that is so the enemy is not the community charge it is 
highspending labor councils mrs thatcher retorted

hungarys new freely elected parliament 
thursday declared its support for lithuania and the leader of a 
centerright party began trying to form the first noncommunist 
government in four decades 
at a historic session of parliament interim president arpad 
goencz nominated jozsef antall who heads the largest faction in 
parliament as premierdesignate and asked him to form a government 
antall said he hoped to forge a coalition before the end of the 
month 
i will try to lead the country out of this difficult 
situation he said 
the new government will be saddled with a 21 billion foreign 
debt the largest per capita debt in eastern europe doubledigit 
inflation rising unemployment and resultant growing social 
tensions 
i appeal for confidence so that we can form hungarys first 
coalition government antall said 
if antall succeeds in building a centerright coalition it will 
have a simple majority of 229 seats but it would lack the 
twothirds majority needed for major constitutional changes 
the government of premier miklos nemeth offered its resignation 
wednesday but will stay on as a caretaker government until the new 
cabinet takes charge goencz who was jailed for six years after 
the 1956 anticommunist uprising was elected interim president by 
the house wednesday 
the new government would be hungarys first noncommunist 
government in 43 years 
deputies from half a dozen parties fill the legislature and the 
former communists have been relegated to a minor opposition role 
with only 33 seats in the 394seat body 
antalls party the hungarian democratic forum had been 
conducting coalition talks with the likeminded independent 
smallholders and the christian democrats they have 44 and 21 seats 
respectively 
antall told a news conference after his nomination that the 
first task of his government would be to strengthen international 
ties to better relations with the united states and western europe 
and to keep correct relations with the soviet union 
he said he also hoped to accelerate the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from hungarian territory the two countries have agreed on 
the complete withdrawal of the red army by june of next year 
the soviet presence in hungary is largely associated with soviet 
tanks that crushed the 1956 anticommunist uprising 
on wednesday the house adopted a motion formally declaring the 
revolt a revolution and freedom fight the communists for decades 
had condemned it as a counterrevolution 
the motion on lithuania was added to the agenda just before the 
session ended ever since moscow began imposing economic sanctions 
against lithuania hungarians have compared it to 1956 when other 
countries stood by as their revolution was crushed 
we deem unacceptable the use of coercive measures and all 
steps that can hinder the realization of the right of the 
lithuanian people to selfdetermination the text said we 
hereby express our solidarity with the lithuanian people and its 
endeavors to attain selfdetermination 
the resolution urged the kremlin to begin negotiations with 
lithuanian leaders to ensure their right to selfdetermination and 
preservation of political stability of the soviet union and of 
international security

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher on thursday welcomed the us decision not to modernize 
its shortrange missiles based on german soil saying it shows nato 
knows how to change with the times 
genscher made the remark while attending the nato meeting in 
brussels where the missile announcement was made 
this shows the alliance takes into account the changed 
conditions of eastwest relations the foreign ministry quoted 
him as saying 
there was no immediate comment from the opposition social 
democrats who have been pressing hard for removal of us 
shortrange nuclear weapons in west germany they were sure to 
welcome the announcement 
in brussels british foreign secretary douglas hurd said its 
an updating of the alliances stance 
west german television proclaimed a new disarmament 
initiative has come out of washington 
there is no doubt that nato does not want to be caught running 
behind developments in eastern and central europe said a zdf 
television commentator 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states 
will cancel development of more powerful shortrange nuclear 
missiles for europe and will not upgrade its nuclear artillery 
shells 
baker also said president bush wants to accelerate negotiations 
with the soviet union on reducing existing shortrange nuclear arms 
last year under intense pressure from genscher and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl nato agreed to postpone a decision on 
modernizing the shortrange nuclear arms 
kohl and genscher called for such a delay because of the growing 
west german view that a time of improved eastwest relations was 
also a time for increased disarmament west germans are also 
especially sensitive to the shortrange nuclear arsenals since 
they would land on german soil if they were ever used in combat 
a saying coined during debate at the time was the shorter the 
range the deader the german 
zdf said it appeared washington made the arms decisions to try 
to overcome soviet resistance to having a united germany in nato 
this should sweeten the bitter pill it said 
the soviet union fearing the strategic implications has said 
it cannot accept nato membership for a united germany east germany 
has long been moscows most important military ally 
just after the us announcement east germany said that as 
planned it had returned to the soviet union last month the scud b 
shorterrange nuclear arsenals on east german soil 
east germanys news agency adn said the action was in line 
with a decision by the east german government in january 
according to the international institute for strategic studies 
in london 28 scud b launchers were stationed in east germany 
the scud b is not considered the same type of weapon that the 
united states announced it would not be modernizing it has a range 
of up to 186 miles a distance greater than the lance rockets 
washington has decided against upgrading 
shortrange nuclear missiles similar to the lance with a range 
of up to 93 miles remain in east germany 
according to nato the soviets have hundreds of shortrange 
nuclear missiles spread across the warsaw pact countries and 
thousands of nuclear artillery pieces

warner bros responding to accusations of 
bronxbashing in its film adaptation of the bonfire of the 
vanities has agreed to tack on a standard disclaimer at the end 
of the movie 
the company confirmed thursday that an agreement had been 
reached to run a twosentence statement assuring moviegoers that 
the story is fictional 
its the kind of thing you see in most movies and a lot of 
books said a warner official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity its not anything special 
the movie based on tom wolfes bestselling novel about a wall 
street bond salesman who gets enmeshed in the bronx court system 
infuriated borough president fernando ferrer ferrer got a glimpse 
of the script last month when several scenes were shot on location 
in the bronx and on wall street 
he criticized the movies negative depiction of the borough and 
sought a disclaimer detailing the bronxs cultural institutions he 
didnt quite get that in the agreement reached earlier this week 
the full disclaimer reads 
this motion picture is a work of fiction and is not intended 
to reflect actual events or conditions in the localities portrayed 
warner bros wishes to thank the mayors office of film theater 
and broadcasting and the people of the city of new york for their 
cooperation during the filming 
ferrer said in a statement that warner bros had missed the 
point of his objection 
the real issue here was to give voice to people who do not 
have access to warner bros or the media who feel their positive 
contributions should be acknowledged ferrer said 
when i expressed my indignation over the filming it was 
already evident that warner bros never intended to give the bronx 
that small gesture of acknowledgement 
filming for the movie has moved to los angeles which so far has 
not requested a disclaimer

the 1000 fine for violations of child labor 
laws is failing to deter employers lawmakers said thursday as they 
proposed increasing the federal fine to 10000 
businesses that repeatedly hire children for dangerous jobs or 
work youngsters for too many hours would face fines of up to 
100000 and yearlong jail terms for their executives under the 
measure 
the legislation was introduced in congress along with the 
release of a study that reports such violations jumped 150 percent 
in a recent sixyear period 
under the bill the labor department would have to keep 
nationwide statistics on workplace fatalities injuries and 
illnesses involving workers under age 18 
house members who introduced the measure said the size of the 
nations child labor problem is unknown because of poor 
recordkeeping and detection 
we have grabbed onto the large tail of an unseen beast said 
rep charles schumer dny 
the labor department which has recently cracked down on child 
labor violators is reviewing changes in such laws though the 
agency has not taken a stand on raising the penalty for each 
infraction to 10000 it has made administrative changes to 
increase the fine structure 
previously the labor department fined businesses 1000 for 
each child involved it has now started fining employers 1000 for 
each infraction 
rep don pease dohio another sponsor said the fines are 
often reduced by the labor department and dont even amount to a 
slap on the wrist 
the measure would also impose stiff penalties for willful 
violations that result in a childs death or injury 
if a worker under 18 suffered serious bodily injury from a 
willful violation the employer would face a fine of up to 250000 
and a sevenyear jail term violations involving a death would 
carry the same fine and 14 years in jail 
a general accounting office study said information provided by 
26 states showed that in 1988 children under age 18 suffered more 
than 31500 workrelated injuries and illnesses 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said the huge 
increase in detected child labor violations may be due to a tight 
labor market and increased enforcement by the labor department 
the number of child labor violations uncovered by the labor 
department grew from about 10000 in fiscal year 1983 to nearly 
25000 in fiscal 1989 the study said 
last month the labor department uncovered about 12000 
violations during a threeday nationwide sweep those violations 
are expected to result in fines of nearly 4 million to employers

spurred by the historic changes 
sweeping europe the united states and its 15 western allies agreed 
thursday to hold nato and eastwest summits this year to reach a 
treaty reducing troops and nonnuclear arms 
the decision was announced after secretary of state james a 
baker iii briefed nato foreign ministers on a new us nuclear 
missile cutback and on the need to adapt the alliance to a lessened 
soviet military threat 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner reported the alliances 
consensus to have a summit in london in early summer and an 
eastwest summit in paris by years end 
nato is preparing for the future he said the atlantic 
alliance is taking advantage of the historic opportunity to move 
from confrontation to cooperation 
the sole sour note was an accusation by woerner the former west 
german defense minister that the soviets were footdragging in 
negotiations to reduce troops tanks artillery and other 
nonnuclear forces 
baker stressed that holding the 35nation summit depends on 
completing the conventional forces in europe cfe treaty 
unless we conclude a cfe agreement we should postpone a csce 
summit he told reporters 
the csce or conference on security and cooperation in europe 
is comprised of all the nations of europe except albania along 
with the united states and canada 
baker said the negotiations to limit soviet troops in europe to 
195000 and us forces to 225000 have not proceeded as rapidly 
as we would have thought 
he said he would have a better grasp of the situation after 
meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in bonn 
friday and saturday and again in the soviet union in two weeks 
he also announced as president bush did in washington that the 
united states would shelve plans to deploy more powerful lance 
shortrange nuclear missiles in west germany and would not upgrade 
nuclear artillery shells in europe 
in addition he offered to accelerate negotiations with the 
soviets to make cuts in the current stockpile of 1600 missiles 
with ranges of up to 300 miles once the cfe treaty is wrapped up 
the decision to shelve development of a new lance missile 
underscores the rapid pace of change in eastwest relations west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher welcomed the 
decision saying it shows nato knows how to change with the times 
in may 1989 the nato allies agreed to upgrade the aging lance 
missiles with those plans now canceled the lance will become 
obsolete by 1995 
in 1975 the csce set a course for lessening eastwest tensions 
by promoting human rights and reducing military frictions 
now with natos military mission rapidly diminishing the 
united states and its allies seek to expand the role of the 
35nation organization 
we need a more ambitious agenda for the csce baker said 
he suggested such missions as monitoring unusual military 
activity and managing disputes between members 
to prepare for the 35nation summit baker announced he would 
host a meeting of all csce foreign ministers in new york in late 
september 
he apppealed to the soviets to speed up the negotiations on a 
treaty and said he was confident soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will overcome this period of slow progress 
the main obstacles to a treaty are disputes over limiting 
airplanes and helicopters and how to monitor cutbacks 
woerner said the allies agreed that a unified germany would be a 
member of the nato alliance and have no chemical or nuclear 
weapons in a concession to moscow he said soviet troops could 
remain in what is now east germany for a number of years 
we have no intention of shifting the balance to the detriment 
of the soviet union he said 
gorbachev reiterated only last week his opposition to nato 
membership for a unified germany and shevardnadze said last month 
the new germany should be nonaligned or possibly belong to both 
nato and the warsaw pact 
the issue will confront baker in both his sessions with 
shevardnadze and at a meeting of the two germanys and the four 
victorious world war ii allies the united states britain france 
and the soviet union 
the socalled twoplusfour talks will focus mainly on allaying 
the concerns of germanys neighbors during german reunification

dancing and singing israeli settlers held a 
religious ceremony thursday at a jewish seminary in the heart of 
the west bank city of nablus and the army clamped a curfew on the 
city to thwart palestinian protests 
arabs fear that the seminary josephs tomb yeshiva will become 
the core of nablus first settlement 
in an effort to avoid friction the army barred settlers from 
bringing in 17 busloads of supporters for the ceremony in which a 
new torah scroll was brought into the seminary only 100 settlers 
were allowed to take part 
dozens of soldiers stood guard as the settlers some sitting on 
each others shoulders danced with the scroll the torah was 
carried under a violet embroidered canopy 
several rightwing members of parliament including parliament 
speaker dov shilansky of prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud 
bloc attended at the invitation of the settlers 
the military permitted a small group from the leftist peace now 
movement to stage a protest at the site the legendary burial place 
of the son of the biblical patriarch jacob 
the leftists in a futile attempt to drown out the settlers 
singing stood in line and sang the song of peace a famous 
israeli antiwar song 
yossi sarid a leftwing lawmaker who led the protests said the 
ceremony was a political provocation 
this has nothing religious in it he said we are familiar 
with these peoples political views they want to cause 
provocations on every hill near every tree and every tomb 
they have nothing sacred no god in their hearts and they are 
ready to exploit the torah for political purposes he said 
settlement leader benny katzover said the ceremony was purely 
religious and that peace now was wrong to intervene 
they stick to us like leeches katzover said they are 
wrong and we will continue our actions 
however noam livnat a spokesman for the seminary acknowledged 
the political element to the ceremony saying it was an assertion 
of jewish claims to the biblical land of israel which includes the 
west bank israel captured the west bank from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war 
were not just talking about bringing a torah to the seminary 
but about a declaration that the land of israel is ours all of 
it only ours livnat said on israel radio 
the seminary has been a source of controversy a top shamir aide 
recently announced he wanted to build sleeping quarters for the 
yeshiva students who at present have to leave nablus at night in 
accordance with army orders 
palestinians believe that establishing a dormitory would 
constitute a permanent settlement in nablus the city has been a 
major hotbed of violence during the nearly 29month arab rebellion 
against israeli occupation 
an army spokesman said thursdays curfew on the city and 
surrounding refugee camps confined about 160000 people to their 
homes 
several hours before the ceremony soldiers searched palestinian 
homes and erected observation posts on rooftops near the seminary 
arab witnesses said 
a helicopter hovered above and roadblocks were erected around 
the city to keep out nonresidents 
the army said the measures were aimed at preventing clashes 
between palestinians and settlers the moslem fundamentalist hamas 
movement had called on palestinians to attack soldiers and settlers 
in protest 
ghassan shakaa a proplo nablus lawyer warned in a telephone 
interview that a settlement in nablus will create a new wave of 
confrontations with the settlers 
since the march 15 collapse of israels coalition government 
ground has been broken on two new settlements and it has been 
revealed that the government secretly funded another settlement 
the developments have strained relations between israel and the 
united states which considers jewish settlement in occupied lands 
an obstacle to peace 
students of the josephs tomb seminary have been involved in 
several bloody clashes with palestinians 
last june about 30 students rampaged through the west bank 
village of kifl harith burning trees smashing windows and firing 
at random a 13yearold girl was shot and killed four seminary 
students were indicted in the case 
the yeshivas rabbi yitzhak ginzburg created a furor in israel 
when he said after the incident that jewish blood and the blood of 
nonjews are not equal god forbid 
several weeks later a yehsiva student ambushed a group of arab 
workers near tel aviv killing one of the men he was arrested

blood bank agencies announced plans thursday 
to screen all blood donations for hepatitis c the most common 
serious infection spread by blood transfusion 
the american association of blood banks the american red cross 
and the council of community blood centers said in a joint 
statement that the donated blood will be screened using a new test 
licensed on tuesday by the food and drug administration 
by some estimates about 7500 to 20000 of the 4 million 
americans receiving blood transfusions annually develop acute 
hepatitis c officials said the new test may cut that number of 
infections by about 50 percent 
jon macpherson executive director of the council of community 
blood centers said the groups also were suggesting that patients 
who have received blood transfusions within the last 20 years 
should consider being tested for hepatitis c 
hundreds of thousands of people have been infected in the past 
and may not know it he said they should call their physician 
and ask about being evaluated 
hepatitis c formerly called hepatitis nona nonb is thought 
to be caused by a virus called hcv it infects from 150000 to 
200000 americans annually only 5 to 10 percent of these cases are 
attributed to blood transfusions other sources are thought to be 
shared drug needles and some studies suggest sexual relations 
the source of at least half of the hepatitis c infections however 
is unknown 
symptoms of hepatitis c for most patients are mild and the 
disease usually is not diagnosed there is no generally available 
treatment for the disease but some experimental studies are 
underway 
for 10 to 20 percent of the patients hepatitis c can be 
serious leading to lifethreatening liver disease or cirrhosis 
it is estimated by the blood agencies that the new testing will 
prevent 500 to 5000 new cases of transfusionassociated cirrhosis 
the new hepatitis c test marketed by ortho diagnostic systems 
inc tests blood samples for antibodies to the hepatitis c virus 
earlier tests for hepatitis c used indirect measures that were less 
precise 
a joint study by the blood agencies said up to 1 percent of all 
us blood donors are expected to test positive for hcv but 
between 40 and 70 percent of this number will be false positives 
blood donations will not be accepted from those who test 
positive for hcv the statement said even though we do not know 
whether they are truly infected because of the high false 
positive ratio

oncesecret government reports on nuclear arms 
plants reveal illegal drug use major safety lapses theft and 
other security breaches within the last nine months 
the troubles are catalogued in a sixinch stack of internal 
documents made public by the energy department this week a month 
after a department contractor revealed their existence by 
mistakenly sending copies of one report to governors offices 
the department initially tried to keep a lid on the revelations 
failing that energy secretary james d watkins announced he was 
making the reports publicly available to show that i am serious 
about changing the way doe does business 
the release of the papers called daily operations reports and 
written from the departments regional field offices marks a 
significant if limited opening in the wall of secrecy behind 
which the nuclear weapons industry has operated for nearly a 
halfcentury 
the weapons plants are owned by the energy department and 
operated by private contractors 
the reports covering the period of aug 24 1989 to present 
describe problems ranging in seriousness from safety lapses at the 
savannah river sc nuclear reactors to worries about media 
noise over environmental problems at the rocky flats arms plant 
near denver 
much of the information was presented in a shorthand form with 
little or no detail but it unveiled several episodes not 
previously acknowledged to the public 
among the more serious cases 
a backup system for pumping water to cool one of the savannah 
river nuclear reactors may have been unusable for the past five 
years because of missing wiring engineers discovered the problem 
only last december 
significant uranium releases at the hanford weapons plant in 
washington state were not reported for several months the reason 
the releases occurred after the energy department standard for 
radiation protection was inadvertently canceled in january 1989 
but before it was reinstated in july 1989 
a faulty circuit breaker started two fires in a powerhouse at 
savannah river last august forcing two nuclear materials 
processing operations to be shut down for several days no one was 
reported injured damage was estimated at 50000 
security guards at several weapons plants were dismissed or 
resigned after being arrested for theft of governmentowned guns 
and other property a guard at the nevada test site where warheads 
are detonated in underground tests resigned in february after he 
was arrested for holding stolen property including two rifles one 
shotgun and five handguns he carried in his personal vehicle 
in april a security guard at savannah river was accused of 
sleeping on duty after a supervisor at one of the reactor buildings 
walked into his locked and darkened office to find the guard 
getting up from the floor a later report said that wasnt 
evidence enough to make the charge stick 
illegal drug use was reported throughout the weapons complex 
in one nineday period in november nine cases of illegal drug use 
were reported at five plants or laboratories in september an 
operator of one of the savannah river nuclear reactors was 
suspended after testing positive for unspecified drug use 
other reports described incidents that viewed in isolation may 
have been minor but taken together formed a pattern of violations 
that could lead to serious accidents in one of the most potentially 
hazardous working environments on earth 
for example 
operations involving the metal beryllium at the oak ridge plant 
in tennessee were suspended for more than a month last fall to 
improve hygiene practices and tighten operating procedures and 
engineering controls exposure to airborne beryllium dust has been 
associated with an incurable lung disease berylliosis 
an unspecified violation of safety limits for nuclear materials 
at rocky flats was not reported to plant managers until four days 
after it was discovered 
a worker at the argonne nuclear laboratory in illinois was seen 
sawing through a pipe that had been specially painted to indicate 
it was radioactive

federal efforts to help schools educate 
teenagers about aids havent caught up with the need posed by the 
epidemic a congressional study said thursday 
twothirds of the nations public school districts reported 
providing formal education about aids during the last school year 
the general accounting office said 
the education was not in all grades and tended to drop off in 
the 11th and 12th grades when students are at an age when sexual 
activity that could expose them to the aids virus tends to 
increase according to gao the investigative arm of congress 
most american teenagers have received essential information 
on the causes of aids and how to minimize the risks of becoming 
infected with hiv the aidscausing virus said mark v nadel 
associate director of gaos human resources division 
however there still are gaps in the provision of aids 
education 
students in smaller school districts are less likely to receive 
any aids education nadel said 
aids education efforts are most clearly deficient where they 
are most clearly needed in the highrisk outofschool 
population which includes runaway and homeless youth he said 
nadel spoke at a senate governmental affairs committee hearing 
on prevention of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
as much as people may want to get aids behind them the 
epidemic among youth may be only just beginning said the 
chairman sen john glenn dohio 
since education is still the most potent weapon we have to 
control this epidemic we need education programs that provide the 
facts about this disease 
the federal centers for disease control which handles federal 
aids education efforts should be required to take a stronger 
leadership role in developing ways to extend education efforts in 
the upper grades gao said 
cdcled nationwide education efforts are not yet commensurate 
with the epidemics potential for disaster the report said 
one in five teachers providing aidsrelated instruction have no 
training in the area and those who do often got too little the 
report said 
the gao recommended the health and human services department 
work with state education agencies to assist smaller school 
districts overcome community barriers to aids education and ensure 
that districts taking federal money collect adequate information 
from students 
an accompanying report on outofschool youth said cdc has 
accomplished relatively little in providing education about the 
virus outside of schools 
dr gary r noble assistant surgeon general and deputy director 
of the cdc defended the agencys education efforts 
aids instruction drops off in the upper grades because its 
usually offered in health classes not offered to upperclassmen or 
are elective courses in the upper grades he said 
the cdc he said is recommending organized program of 
instruction in all grade levels

the disappearance of 5yearold melissa 
brannen from a christmas party in virginia and the kidnapping by a 
masked gunman of 11yearold jacob wetterling in minnesota 
terrorized their communities 
but they are the exception not the rule for abducted children 
according to a justice department study released thursday 
the overwhelming majority of the 359000 children kidnapped each 
year are taken by relatives the study said 
nevertheless 200 to 300 kidnappings a year are dramatic enough 
to prompt headlines and are what the public generally perceives 
when it hears about an abduction a stranger forcibly taking a 
child for a long period of time and possibly killing the victim 
the brannen and wetterling cases last year fit this definition 
of the stereotypical abduction created by he researchers who 
compiled the study missing abducted runaway and thrownaway 
children in america neither child has been found 
as many as 4600 children are kidnapped by people who are not 
relatives in abductions that can include rapes and assaults many 
of these kidnappings never attract the publics attention 
according to the researchers david finkelhor of the university of 
new hampshire gerald hotaling of the university of lowell in 
massachusetts and andrea sedlak of westat inc 
the fact that only 14 percent of all abductions of children are 
committed by strangers should ease parents fears of strangers 
said ernie allen president of the national center for missing and 
exploited children 
we dont want parents to be paralyzed by fear he said 
adding however if there are 300 melissa brannens a year thats 
10 elementary school classrooms full thats a tremendous concern 
the study says the estimate of 4600 abductions may be low a 
number of these abductions may never be reported to the police 
because the victims of these assaults or rapes are ashamed or 
intimidated the study said 
the study was required by the 1984 missing children act 
overall the researchers estimated that in 1988 there were 
354100 children abducted by relatives up to 4600 kidnapped by 
nonfamily members 450700 who ran away 127100 who were thrown 
away abandoned or deserted told to leave the home or told to 
stay out after leaving voluntarily and 438200 who were lost or 
were otherwise missing 
the study said 114600 children may have been involved in 
attempted kidnappings with the majority involving strangers 
unsuccessfully trying to lure the children into automobiles 
the study said many children thought to be missing actually were 
not caretakers did know where they were the problem was in 
recovering them 
the report also said that at least 22 percent of the children 
previously considered runaways should be treated as throwaways

for the first time in more than half a 
century poland officially celebrated its national day on the third 
of may honoring the nations democratic traditions and breaking 
with its communist past 
unlike recent years when the day was marked by violent clashes 
between police and antigovernment demonstrators poles observed 
the holiday thursday by returning to a tradition of parades church 
services and family outings 
the holiday marks the anniversary of polands 1791 democratic 
constitution europes first written constitution 
im very happy that this day has come back said a smiling 
dariusz chmielewski joined by his wife and 8yearold son on 
warsaws victory square where an army band dressed in red white 
and blue 17thcentury uniforms performed before about 2000 people 
we have been waiting for this for a long time and it has 
finally come true he said 
the may 3 holiday commemorates polands shortlived attempt in 
1791 to avoid russian domination by establishing a government based 
on a liberal constitution 
four years later the country was swallowed up by its powerful 
neighbors russia austria and prussia and disappeared from the 
map of europe for 123 years 
after poland regained its independence in 1918 may 3 became the 
countrys national day equivalent to the american fourth of july 
but observances were banned after the 1939 nazi invasion 
after the war polands communist government abolished the 
holiday and changed the national day to july 22 the anniversary of 
the 1944 proclamation of a promoscow government 
in recent years communist authorities organized some official 
observances in an effort to coopt the holiday but these were 
overshadowed by the antigovernment protests 
but last month the new solidarityled government sponsored 
legislation to abolish july 22 as the national day and restore may 
3 to its official status 
parliament approved the bill and president wojciech jaruzelski 
signed it into law one week ago 
the hasty enactment of the new official holiday caught many 
poles unaware giving them an unexpected day off just after the may 
1 workers holiday which is fast losing significance with the 
demise of communism 
thursdays observances began with a flagraising ceremony at 
warsaws royal castle attended by jaruzelski prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki and other officials 
later at victory square the military band entertained the crowd 
by performing military and church music as well as cabaret songs 
and even a bit of swing 
for poles long used to ponderous official communist ceremonies 
the lighthearted music brought smiles and cheers 
they cheered again when mazowiecki the former solidarity 
adviser and political prisoner who formed eastern europes first 
noncommunist government last august suddenly appeared on a small 
platform in their midst 
the prime minister normally sadfaced smiled and waved as he 
urged people to sing along to the music 
a mass for the nations leaders was held thursday evening at 
warsaws st johns cathedral in past years police would forcibly 
break up antigovernment protests after may 3 services at the 
cathedral 
elsewhere in poland tens of thousands of people took part in an 
outdoor mass in the southern shrine city of czestochowa attended by 
cardinal jozef glemp the catholic primate in recent years the 
roman catholic church has observed may 3 as a feast day honoring 
the virgin mary 
at victory square 76yearold janina lebenstein recalled past 
may 3 celebrations before world war ii when there were parades 
little bars and buffets and dancing in the square 
we are happy to live to see this day she said its not 
yet like it should be but maybe next year it is going to be 
beautiful

a local journalist summed up latvian 
president anatoly gorbunov who was reelected thursday in one 
phrase hes come a long way baby 
gorbunov 48 belongs to a breed of baltic politicians who 
swept along by popular reforms turned from a communist party 
functionary into a champion of independence 
along the way he gained the expertise in two arenas moscow 
and riga that makes him a capable gobetween in the tough 
negotiations with the kremlin that are just beginning 
thanks to you personally latvia has very strong and elastic 
political contacts in moscow a latvian deputy said thursday as 
the parliament questioned gorbunov before his election 
questioners thursday did not focus on gorbunovs past but 
several activists recalled with irony that he went on record about 
three years ago calling proindependence protesters traitors of 
the people 
on thursday gorbunov declared i believe the renewal of a 
legally sovereign nation must be done 
so hes come a long way baby said karl streips an 
american of latvian descent who writes for the popular front 
newspaper atmoda 
despite gorbunovs former party orthodoxy its become very 
evident hes extremely popular and he was elected on the peoples 
front slate and he has been saying the right things streips 
said 
gorbunovs popularity in the republic he is considered its 
bestliked politician was reflected in thursdays vote of 196 
deputies 153 backed him 
gorbunov a trim man with thick dark hair and blackframed 
glasses that give him a clark kent look appeared authoritative and 
at ease fielding questions 
he stood up against nationalists who want tough requirements for 
citizenship in independent latvia saying they should consider 
the realistic situation 
almost half of latvias population is not ethnic latvian and 
many of the russians and ukrainians migrated to the republic after 
it was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 many latvian 
nationalists want only those who resided in the republic before 
1940 and their children eligible for citizenship 
gorbunov acknowledged he had recently jumped ship from a lofty 
party position in the central committee to join the latvian 
communist party that broke away from its moscow parent party 
but this latest twist in gorbunovs career like the earlier 
changes incited little criticism at the latvian supreme soviet 
only idiots dont change their minds said nikolai neilands 
a deputy foreign minister 
neilands said gorbunov could be compared to algirdas brazauskas 
lithuanias communist party chief who is also extremely popular at 
home and wellrespected in moscow as well 
in lithuania however brazauskas lost the race for the 
presidency to vytautas landsbergis who was far more radical in his 
drive for independence that latvias parliament elected a 
gorbunovtype instead reflected the republics tactic of seeking 
independence more gradually and with more consideration for the 
kremlins desires

president bush on thursday promised to help 
iran get details on the fate of four kidnapped diplomats calling 
it a goodwill gesture and not an attempt to bargain for us 
hostages 
this is something they feel very strongly about bush told a 
news conference theyve mentioned it to us several different 
times 
in his most conciliatory remarks toward iran to date bush said 
its something id like to do and i think they would consider 
this a gesture of goodwill 
bush said that the best information we have is that the 
iranians kidnapped in beirut in 1982 are dead 
but he said if theres some way that we can go back and get 
any information that would relieve the anxieties of the loved ones 
of those four people we ought to do that 
at the same time bush insisted that the united states would do 
nothing that would entail bargaining for the release of the 
remaining six american hostages in lebanon 
he said that while he welcomed the release of robert polhill and 
frank reed i cant rejoice and say that my heart is full of 
great goodwill as long as six others are held hostage 
irans charge daffairs mohsen muscavi and three aides have 
been missing from irans embassy in beirut since the early days of 
the 1982 israeli invasion of lebanon 
bush cited the case when he was asked if he were prepared to 
make any goodwill gestures toward iran for its help in obtaining 
the release of polhill and reed 
i would have in mind any gesture that wouldnt be perceived as 
negotiating for the release of hostages bush said 
let me give you an example bush continued one of the 
things the iranians are interested in is the fate of the four 
diplomats 
just as the united states wants to learn more about the fate of 
marine col william r higgins presumed to be dead i can 
understand the iranians wanting a full accounting of their 
diplomats bush said 
he said he was not suggesting that iran believes the united 
states had anything to do with the seizure 
so heres an area where they have said theyd like some 
information and if we can get it i think we ought to get it 
bush said and were trying so if that is goodwill so be it i 
hope it is 
bush also said that there might be other things that the united 
states could do along the same lines 
however he sidestepped taking a position on one iranian demand 
that the united states pressure israel for the release of 400 
moslem shiites held in israel including cleric leader sheik abdul 
karim obeid 
i want to see all hostages released bush said but he said 
there were definitional problems in relation to the issue of 
hostages held in israel 
asked to elaborate bush said because some people view people 
that they hold as having broken their laws and some dont and 
its not for the us to make these determinations 
the president who previously has thanked both iran and syria 
for helping to free the two us hostages said he didnt think 
anything the united states done had any bearing on the two releases 
meanwhile senate minority leader bob dole rkan urged us 
officials to press for more information about higgins whose 
captors in lebanon said last october that they had executed him 
dole noted that higgins body was never recovered and no one 
knows for sure what happened to him higgins captors released a 
videotape showing the american hanging from a noose fbi experts 
concluded it was authentic 
higgins was head of the un peacekeeping force in lebanon when 
he was kidnapped 
bush said the united states will stand by its policy of not 
bartering for hostages 
we will continue to stay with the policy trying to show 
goodwill where we can do it without violating the policy 
he said there were no behindthescenes negotiations 
involving the united states that led to the release of polhill on 
april 22 or reed on april 3 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 raum

the united states and the soviet union should 
stop sending weapons to afghanistan and encourage elections an 
asian scholar told congress thursday 
the remarks of barnett rubin a fellow at the us institute of 
peace came amid a report that washington and moscow are taking a 
new tack in the effort to end the war in afghanistan the new york 
times reported that both sides have shown flexibility on the issue 
the soviets have indicated their willingness to accept elections 
for a new government while the united states has said it would 
allow najibullah the current sovietinstalled leader to run for 
president if he first resigns unidentified officials said 
secretary of state james baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze will discuss afghanistan at their meeting later 
this month the state department said in a statement thursday 
the statement also confirmed that robert kimmitt the under 
secretary of state has said we do not object to najibullah or 
his associates participating in the elections that is for the 
afghans not us to decide 
the future of afghanistan was discussed at a meeting of the 
commission on security and cooperation in europe known at the 
helsinki commission 
members of congress have raised questions recently about the 
purpose of the estimated 600 million in secret aid that the united 
states channels annually to the afghan guerrillas there have been 
allegations that the money has not been fairly distributed to the 
rebels 
the rebels have been divided particularly since the withdrawal 
of soviet troops in february 1989 despite the withdrawal the 
soviets have contined to provide millions of dollars in military 
hardware the najibullah government 
rubin said it was pointless for moscow and washington to 
continue the weapons drain 
a military solution cannot work not only because neither side 
can defeat the other but more fundamentally because there are 
not two sides a victory of any of the many contending forces 
would provoke a civil war on the part of those who are excluded 
he said 
he said the goal should be a political settlement in which the 
afghans choose their own leaders without any conditions set by 
outsiders afghanistan becomes a neutral buffer state and all 
foreign powers cease to supply weapons or engage in covert 
operations 
preelection talks should include all elements of afghan 
society including representatives of major commanders religious 
and tribal dignitaries ethnic and religious minorities former 
government officials and former king zaher shah 
such talks could be held under the auspices of the united 
states perhaps acting in conjunction with the organization of the 
islamic conference he said 
rubin said he felt confident the soviets and najibullah would 
adhere to their pledge to support the result of election in 
afghanistan because of their performance in nicaragua and eastern 
europe

a piano concerto written 150 years ago by franz 
liszt was being performed thursday night for the first time and 
the soloist says the honor of playing the longlost composition was 
a gift from god 
all i have to say is there are 50 million pianists out there 
right now that would like to be me pianist janina fialkowska 
said hours before the debut of the concerto for piano and orchestra 
before a sellout crowd at the chicago symphony orchestra 
fialkowska acknowledged some nervousness and a tremendous sense 
of responsibility in performing the work discovered by a doctoral 
student from the university of chicago doing archival research in 
europe 
i was much more careful with this said fialkowska a 
canadian who now lives in connecticut i had to approach every 
note of the piece and choose a way that would satisfy myself the 
public and liszt 
i have grown to love the piece she said i want the piece 
to be a success i want the piece to be loved 
its a gift from god she said of being asked to perform the 
concerto 
liszt a hungarian who lived from 1811 until 1886 was a 
virtuoso pianist and a prolific composer who performed and taught 
across europe 
he divided his household in so many cities that he invariably 
lost track of some materials said rena mueller a liszt scholar 
who teaches at new york university also he gave sections away 
as gifts sometimes 
it took the work of an enterprising scholar jay rosenblatt to 
piece together sections of liszts work found in the german cities 
nuremberg and weimar and budapest hungary to form the 
onemovement 15minute piece now called concerto opus posthumous 
the materials had been located before and had been seen by 
other scholars said mueller mr rosenblatt was able to put 
them together into a single coherent piece 
the result she said is a large original composition 
it probably dates to the late 1830s at a point when he was 
touring the cultural world demonstrating just what could be done 
on this relatively young instrument the piano she said 
it is one of the major works of liszt that has been 
discovered since the second world war major in terms of scale and 
in terms of its overall importance to the repertory she said 
rosenblatt who is working on his dissertation at the university 
of chicago said thursday he would be on hand for the world 
premiere of the piece at orchestra hall 
alan walker chairman of the music department at mcmaster 
university in ontario and a liszt scholar said the piece 
demonstrates liszts comfort in orchestrating while he was still in 
his early 20s 
the prevailing wisdom is that he didnt learn to handle the 
orchestra until 10 or 15 years later walker said 
despite the fanfare for thursdays premiere the performance of 
the piece was sure to provoke some controversy walker said 
when we say that it was lost its not strictly true because 
several people including liszt himself always knew where the piece 
was walker said 
but liszt didnt publish it so this raises an ethical 
question as to whether or not a piece that liszt never bothered to 
publish in his lifetime should be published at all

president bush on thursday praised jamaican 
prime minister michael manley for a first class job in 
promoting economic progress and promised to seek ways to help the 
country despite us spending constraints 
bush told manley his administration would look into ways to 
relieve jamaicas massive international debt and would try to 
provide more flexibility in a program that provides development 
loans through private banks us officials said 
manley has done a first class job in trying to move jamaica 
forward in many many ways bush said at a news conference before 
he met with manley 
he told manley at the start of their meeting we have great 
respect for what youre doing trying to do 
us officials say they are pleased that manley has abandoned 
the socialist path he had taken when he was prime minister in the 
1970s for more freemarket philosophy 
he has cut government price supports and relaxed the ban on 
foreign investments to deal with jamaicas foreign debt 
the united states wants to help these efforts bush told 
manley but he added i cried on his shoulder a little bit about 
budget limitations we face here in the united states still bush 
said we will continue to support development and growth in 
jamaica 
manley said bush had shown a real interest in a different 
approach to helping jamaica with its 43 billion foreign debt 
what was very good from our point of view was his open 
mindedness and his desire to search with us for solution 
manley said in a telephone interview after the bush meeting 
bush said he directed treasury secretary nick brady and deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleberger to see how much 
flexibility the united states can have in helping jamaica in the 
ways that would benefit their move towards more privatization more 
economic growth and more to the benefit of all jamaican people 
us officials said bush agreed to look into concerns manley 
raised 
specifically manley wants the international monetary fund and 
world bank to allow third world debt to be rescheduled he also 
wants eased restrictions on funds in puerto rico banks that are 
deposited in lieu of taxes by us companies that do business there 
those funds are to be used for loans for development projects in 
the caribbean and manley wants the united states to expand the 
types of projects eligible for the funds into economic and 
technical assistance areas 
the united states recently rescheduled the 813 million debt 
jamaica owes the united states 
bush wants congress to give him more freedom to allocate foreign 
aid so that currently earmarked funds can be used to accomodate the 
needs of small nations such as jamaica 
the administration cut 25 million in aid from jamaica last year 
to help the new democracy in poland but is seeking that amount in 
its new budget request for jamaica 
we have been concerned that some of us who have been in the 
trenches of democracy all along might get forgotten in the new 
excitement manley said 
but i am very confident from things we have observed in 
president bushs administration and from our talks today that you 
do not intend to divert from our immense needs but rather to seek 
new ways to help new members of the family of democracy he 
said 
manley embraced cubas fidel castro and hewed to socialist 
principles when he held office during the 1970s but he has worked 
on closer relations with the united states since returning to 
office 
manleys views have evolved in ways that obviously we respect 
and support said a us official who briefed reporters about the 
visit on condition of anonymity i think our relations have never 
been better

east germany under pressure from the west 
tried thursday to find a way to quickly shift its vast quantities 
of stateowned land and businesses into the private sector 
under the ousted socialist system that ruled for four decades 
the state owned all property west germany has said a quick 
conversion to private property must follow the agreement the two 
nations reached wednesday on merging their economies 
that agreement came under heavy fire thursday from critics who 
said it will speed the collapse of many east german factories and 
hurt poor and handicapped people by taking away social subsidies 
thousands of shoe and leather workers at factories staged brief 
warning strikes to demand their jobs be protected employees halted 
work in east berlin erfurt gera lauchhammer karlmarxstadt and 
weissenfels the government news agency adn said 
east germanys finance and foreign ministers also criticized the 
plan causing the first major cracks in the broad coalition 
government of east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
de maiziere answered critics by promising to block the 
uncontrolled acquisition of stateowned assets by west germans 
and foreigners 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann said a quick 
privatization of property and industry was crucial to creating a 
market economy that would spawn jobs and incomes necessary to 
offset the loss of huge social subsidies 
he said many details have to be worked out but quick 
privatization is needed to cope with the widespread joblessness in 
east germany as the country is forced to compete in the free market 
from july onward every company thats active in west germany 
can also become active in east germany haussmann said in bonn 
otto graf lambsdorff head of west germanys free democrats 
said a conversion to private property must quickly follow the 
decision to convert east german marks to west german marks 
otherwise it will be money thrown out the window he said 
teams of experts from the two governments began talks on the key 
aspects of unification in east berlin on thursday 
the talks followed agreement on an economic proposal that was 
billed as a basic plan for merging the economies by july 2 
social democrats who have joined the government of de maiziere 
who leads the conservative christian democrats sharply criticized 
the plan 
east german finance minister walter romberg said the agreement 
still does not give adequate protection to people earning low 
incomes and fails to include a mechanism to protect people when 
rents and livings costs rise in the free market 
east germans now are dependent on subsidized food housing and 
jobs 
a law that adjusts for social shortcomings in east germany 
is of essential significance romberg said in bonn where he met 
with west german finance minister theo waigel 
east german foreign minister markus meckel head of the social 
democrats also criticized the agreement 
some east germans want guarantees that prices and rents will not 
rise at a vastly sharper rate than their wages 
the government of west german chancellor helmut kohl said the 
influx of new western businesses will raise living standards in 
east germany 
the agreement would convert east german wages pensions and 
small savings accounts at a 11 exchange to the west german mark 
it also would convert debts owned by east german factories 
estimated at 200 billion east german marks at a 21 rate those 
debts now will be worth 100 billion west german marks 60 
billion but with western interest rates 
some economists have said that the debts should be forgiven 
entirely to allow the factories to get a fresh start in the free 
market 
the economic agreement rate would allow elderly people to 
convert up to 6000 marks 3500 at a 11 rate but people 14 and 
under could only exchange 2000 marks 1180 all others would 
have a 4000 mark 2360 limit

argentina alleged nazi war criminal joseph schwammberger returned 
to germany as a feeble old man thursday to face charges in the 
deaths of thousands of jews 
schwammberger a former nazi ss lieutenant accused of commanding 
two labor camps in poland was extradited from argentina after 
losing a 30month fight against being returned to germany 
schwammberger 78 had to be supported by a plainclothes 
security man as he walked down the steps from the lufthansa plane 
which flew him from buenos aires to frankfurt he was accompanied 
on the flight by a doctor his attorney and west german officials 
of interpol the international police organization 
schwammberger wearing a tan sweater and checkered shirt 
glanced briefly toward news photographers waiting on the airport 
tarmac but made no comments 
he was led away to a police van and taken to the southern city 
of stuttgart which is the site of the badenwuerttemberg state 
court that asked for his extradition 
officials said he could face trial by the end of the year if 
convicted he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison west 
german has no death penalty 
argentinas supreme court last month upheld the extradition of 
schwammberger who fled to south america after escaping from allied 
authorities following world war ii 
the stuttgart court ordered schwammbergers arrest in 1973 at 
the time he was believed to be in argentina where there is a 
sizable population of germanspeaking immigrants many nazis fled 
to south america following the defeat of nazi germany 
argentine officials captured schwammberger without incident in 
november 1987 at a ranch about 500 miles northwest of buenos aires 
schwammberger variously claim heart and health ailments during his 
incarceration in argentina 
as a naturalized argentine citizen he fought his extradition to 
the supreme court which finally revoked his citizenship the high 
court upheld a lower court ruling that the crimes schwammberger is 
accused of committing occurred before he became an argentine 
citizen 
a native of austria schwammberger is accused of commanding 
forced labor camps from 1942 to 1944 at przemysl and mielec in 
nazioccupied poland at which an estimated 5000 inmates mostly 
jews were executed or deported to death camps 
survivors testified he starved prisoners used dogs to tear them 
apart and threw people alive into fires 
rabbi marvin hier of the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles 
which gathered evidence against schwammberger said in a telephone 
interview here we are not dealing with an administrator but 
with a man who participated directly a man who rolled up his 
sleeves and bloodied his hands every day 
hier said the center has 73 witnesses who plan to testify 
against schwammberger 
hier said schwammberger was arrested by the french army in 1945 
but escaped three years later from a train taking him to us 
military authorities in austria for trial 
he fled to argentina in 1949 where he lived under his own name 
and obtained citizenship in 1965 for years he worked at a 
petrochemical plant in la plata 30 miles south of buenos aires 
in october 1987 the wiesenthal center placed schwammberger on 
its list of most wanted nazi war criminals argentine newspapers 
published the list and police received information of 
schwammbergers whereabouts 
in an interview thursday with west germanys saarland state 
radio simon wiesenthal said schwammbergers extradition after so 
many years is a warning to future murderers who perhaps are 
being born today 
wiesenthal runs a nazihunting center in vienna austria that 
is still tracking hundreds of suspected nazi war criminals in the 
united states canada south america and elsewhere

jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said a meeting 
thursday with president bush left him convinced that bush has no 
objection to jews living anywhere in that city 
but the white house quickly tempered that by saying the united 
states maintains its opposition to israeli settlement in occupied 
territories 
kollek said he explained to bush that his city of 430000 home 
to about 12 percent of israels population would like to get its 
proportional share of immigrants from the soviet union or elsewhere 
i assured him that we had not changed the frontier of 
jerusalem since 67 by a single inch said kollek 
speaking with reporters on the white house driveway kollek 
said i have no doubt that the president has no objection to jews 
settling all over jerusalem without any exception 
we hope to receive a fair amount of the immigration i 
think he and the people around him were satisfied with these 
replies the mayor said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said later in a 
written statement the president believes jews and nonjews ought 
to act in a manner that does not threaten the citys comity or in 
any way prejudice prospects for the peace process 
as recent events in the christian quarter have demonstrated 
the real question is not an abstract one of the rights of jews and 
others but rather how these rights are implemented the 
spokesman said 
the longstanding opposition of the united states to 
settlement activity in the territories occupied by israel in 1967 
is well known so too is the position of the united states 
supporting a united jerusalem whose final status is determined by 
negotiations 
kollek said the arab population of jerusalem doubled in the past 
20 years and the jewish population grew by 80 percent to 85 
percent he said the jewisharab ratio would be roughly 
preserved in the future because there is room to build 25000 
more jewish dwellings and 20000 to 25000 arab homes 
bush stirred a controversy in early march by saying the united 
states objected to new settlements in the west bank or in east 
jerusalem that remark was blamed by some for helping bring about 
the fall of the shamir government 
bush later exchanged letters with kollek who said he is 
satisfied with bushs explanations of us policy 
kollek said that immigrants who settle in jerusalem do not get 
any special benefits that the people in the occupied territories 
get 
kollek told bush in the oval office that the move by jewish 
settlers into a greek orthodox churchowned building in the 
christian quarter was one of the most silly and more destructive 
actions in our recent life 
the supreme court of israel upheld an eviction order against the 
settlers last week and most have left 
while every citizen in israel and jerusalem has the right to 
live wherever he likes one has to use a little bit of common sense 
and sensitivity in such an occasion and that wasnt used on that 
occasion the mayor said 
kollek has helped get 500000 signatures on a petition demanding 
electoral reforms following the parliamentary deadlock that has 
left the country without a new government for weeks 
its an impossible situation he said of the system that 
guarantees tiny parties a knesset seat no matter how small their 
share of the vote

patriarch pimen who headed the russian orthodox 
church through years of repression and a recent renewal in a more 
tolerant soviet union died thursday at the age of 79 
pimen died at his moscow residence after a long illness the 
official soviet news agency tass said it did not elaborate in 
recent years pimen became increasingly frail and rarely celebrated 
services when he did appear in public he needed help to stand or 
move 
as patriarch of moscow and all russia since 1971 pimen led tens 
of millions of believers in the officially atheist soviet union 
some critics accused him of collaboration because he operated 
within strict limits imposed by the kremlin 
probably the way he will be remembered is as a pious monk 
rather than as a dynamic church leader said jane ellis a 
scholar at keston college center for the study of religion and 
communism based in britain 
after a historic meeting with mikhail s gorbachev in 1988 the 
year christianity celebrated the 1000th anniversary of its 
founding in russia pimen praised the soviet leaders reforms 
affecting religion 
in the early years of pimens leadership the russian orthodox 
church supported official soviet policies especially the 
leaderships pronouncements on peace and nuclear disarmament that 
were critical of the united states 
the state rewarded pimen for his loyalty he was a member of the 
governmentsponsored world peace committee and traveled 
extensively in 1982 he addressed a un disarmament conference in 
new york 
he was awarded the officially sponsored soviet peace committees 
gold medal on his 70th birthday he received the governments 
order of the peoples friendship 
for centuries before the 1917 bolshevik revolution russian 
czars imposed political controls on the church but in the 1920s 
and 1930s the communist party went further razing churches and 
imprisoning and sometimes executing clerics 
that repression eased in recent decades nevertheless top 
church officials felt compelled to maintain close ties with 
communist authorities and that angered some religious activists 
as more and more soviets have been drawn to the faith and 
worshiped openly there have been more challenges for the russian 
orthodox church many activists have questioned whether pimen had 
the strength and the inclination to lead the church into a new era 
ellis said pimen was not a strong advocate for the church 
he was one of those like other leaders of the church who 
really was put in the position where in order to keep any church 
life alive at all had to acquiesce and do what the government 
tells them to do and he was one of those who quite clearly did 
that she said in an interview thursday 
metropolitan pitirim head of the russian orthodox churchs 
printing department and reportedly close to gorbachev and his wife 
raisa is regarded as a possible successor to pimen ellis said 
about a halfdozen bishops could be seen as contenders for the post 
and there was no clear frontrunner 
church officials gathered in moscow on thursday night to elect 
an acting patriarch and resolve other matters concerning pimens 
death tass reported but there was no immediate word on who was 
chosen by tradition the churchs top leadership body known as 
the local council and made up of all metropolitans archbishops 
bishops and representatives of the clergy and laymen will gather 
within six months to elect a permanent successor 
born june 23 1910 into a whitecollar family sergei izvekov 
entered the monastery in october 1927 and took the religious name 
pimen he continued his religious education at a time when 
authorities violently repressed the church and he became a priest 
in 1931 
until 1946 he was a priest in a cathedral in murom a city 
about 140 miles east of moscow 
pimen advanced rapidly into more responsible posts in odessa 
rostovondon and pskov in 1960 he was named archbishop and 
became a member of the holy synod the administrative organ of the 
russian orthodox church three years later he was named 
metropolitan of krutitsky and kolomenskoye 
he was chosen patriarch in 1971 succeeding patriarch alexei 
who had led the church 25 years 
pimen was elected to the soviet parliament in march 1989 
we church people ardently pray for the success of the 
restructuring process perestroika and strive to do everything 
possible for its development tass quoted pimen as saying in 1988 
a memorial service was planned friday at bogoyavlensky cathedral 
in moscow no funeral plans were announced

highway deaths are virtually certain to rise 
if automakers are forced to significantly improve fuel efficiency 
by the end of the decade the governments top traffic safety 
official said thursday 
injuries will be more severe deaths will increase because 
automakers would be forced to build smaller cars said jerry r 
curry administrator of the national highway traffic safety 
administration 
in a speech to the society of automotive engineers curry 
criticized special interest groups that want to become the high 
priests of gasoline mileage standards which his agency sets 
under current law new fleets all the cars an automaker 
produces in one model year must have an overall average of 275 
miles per gallon that means some models may fall short of the 
minimum if others exceed it for light trucks the minimum is 20 
mpg 
a bill in the senate would require automakers to improve their 
fleet averages 20 percent by the 1995 model year and 40 percent by 
2001 the minimum for the typical fleet would rise to 344 mpg in 
1995 and 402 mpg by 2001 
environmentalists support the bill saying major improvement in 
fuel economy should be the centerpiece of efforts to curb global 
warming but automakers say the measure would wreak havoc in their 
industry and force them to stop making all but the smallest cars 
curry said it seems inevitable that a big increase in the 
standards would drastically reduce car sizes 
he said in an interview his agency was studying the impact 
increased standards would have on highway deaths 
its very clear from the preliminary data that while we cant 
tell you specifically what it is there is a very definite increase 
in the number of deaths as you downsize cars curry said 
theres no question that smaller cars are more dangerous than 
larger cars its a matter of physics 
sen richard bryan dnev sponsor of the fuel economy 
legislation said automakers had issued equally dire warnings in 
the mid1970s when the current 275 mpg standard was proposed 
these are the same people who said catalytic converters could 
never be done who said we couldnt reach the 27 mpg standard who 
fought air bags sideimpact standards their track record on this 
issue has not been impressive bryan said 
highway fatalities have decreased steadily despite reduced car 
weight in the past two decades he said

the interior department once valued coal at 1 
per ton that it now says is worth 27 cents in a proposal to swap 
the coal for a protected scenic view a congressman charges 
rep mike synar dokla released a national park service memo 
thursday with the higher estimate as he argued that the publics 
coal is being given away at 27 cents a ton 
the park service is part of the interior department another 
interior agency the bureau of land management said the memo was 
mistaken because the 1aton estimate was made for a different 
coal tract by a private consultant 
the interior department wants to trade rights to the 2500acre 
youngs creek coal tract near sheridan wyo for a permanent 
development ban on a ranch owned by businessmanconservationist 
laurance s rockefeller in grand teton national park 
the department which hopes to complete the deal this month now 
values the coal and the conservation easement the power to 
keep the tract from being developed thus protecting the view at 
an equal 56 million since the tract contains an estimated 207 
million tons of coal the value comes to 27 cents a ton 
a wyoming official estimated a year ago that the state and 
federal governments each could have received up to 90 million in 
royalties by keeping the federal tract and allowing it to be 
mined 
interior department officials defended the deal wednesday at a 
hearing of the house government operations environment 
subcommittee chaired by synar 
they said the 27 cent valuation was correct insisting there 
was little interest by mining companies in the tract until 1989 a 
statement disputed by a mining firm which said it sought mining 
rights for years 
the officials also argued the coal was difficult to mine 
compared to other coal in the region and said there might be no 
actual mining for three decades although synar produced documents 
saying mining could begin by 1995 
rep craig thomas rwyo who supports the exchange argued 
that coal values are somewhat abstract and hard to determine 
but the grand teton vista is valuable to everyone im almost 
astounded he said that anyone would criticize the 
preservation of teton park 
under the deal the public would not have access to 
rockefellers jy ranch rockefeller would not personally benefit 
from the exchange because in 1987 he donated the conservation 
easement to the sloankettering memorial institute for cancer 
research of new york city the institute would gain rights to the 
coal tract and plans to sell the coal interest to obtain money for 
its cancer research 
synar released a may 14 1986 memo written by richard young 
chief of the land resources division of the national park service 
for the rocky mountain region 
the memo described a meeting the previous day in casper wyo of 
representatives of the national park service the bureau of land 
management and rockefeller 
values were discussed briefly young wrote for the youngs 
creek tract considering the type of coal the mineability and the 
current market blm estimates the value of about 1 per ton in the 
ground 
roy allen chief of the northwest regional evaluation team of 
the bureau of land management said young was mistaken that the 1 
per ton was a blm estimate 
he said that was the figure supplied by a private consultant as 
the value of a nearby coal tract that was involved in a lawsuit 
at that point he said blm had never estimated the value of 
the youngs creek tract 
david c oneal assistant secretary for land and minterals 
management for the interior department said the deal appears to 
be an outstanding oportunity to protect teton national park from 
future development while avoiding federal costs associated with 
acquisition to prevent potential development

public hearings on sen dave durenbergers 
financial dealings will begin next month the senate ethics 
committee said thursday

evidence of rules violations involving a 100000 book promotion 
deal and free limousine service accepted by the minnesota 
republican 
durenberger has admitted to lapses in judgment but denied any 
willful wrongdoing 
the proceedings could be canceled if durenberger and the panel 
negotiated an agreement to settle the case and the senator said 
thursday whether the hearing is going to be necessary well have 
to wait until early june to make a decision 
its a matter of wanting to bring this to a head he said 
durenberger said his attorney had been talking informally with 
the committees special counsel but he declined to discuss the 
talks 
two weeks of hearings beginning june 12 are scheduled on the 
allegations 
the committee said it would continue its investigation into 
senate reimbursement durenberger received for a condominium of 
which he was a coowner he said he expected that deal to be added 
ot the possible violation the panel would pursue at the june 
hearings 
the committee could recommend that durenberger be censured 
expelled or lose seniority or responsibility the case also could 
be referred to the justice department for a criminal investigation 
the committee has said its investigating 113 paid appearances 
by durenberger in 1985 and 1986 at which he arranged to charge fees 
for speeches and split the proceeds with piranha press of 
minneapolis the publisher of two books he wrote 
the deal may have broken federal law as well as senate rules 
the committee said 
some of the organizations that invited durenberger to speak said 
they considered the appearances standard paid speeches and that his 
books were never mentioned paid speeches count toward the outside 
earnings limits for members of congress

receipts of gifts by accepting nearly 5000 in limousine trips for 
personal travel in 1985 and 1986 
the committee has been investigating the condo deal since 
december when a newspaper disclosed that durenberger charged the 
senate rent when he stayed in his minneapolis condominium from 1983 
to 1989 
durenberger repaid the senate 11005 in january when the rules

several lawmakers called thursday for swift 
action on a bill to curb job discrimination but refused to apply 
the safeguards to their own staffs 
some say the last plantation is here on capitol hill said 
rep charles hayes dill who all the same voted with the 
majority as the house education and labor committee voted 219 
against applying the bill to congressional staff members 
the bill is designed to overturn six 1989 supreme court 
decisions that civil rights forces call severe setbacks provisions 
of the legislation range from a ban on employee harassment in the 
workplace to tightened safeguards against discriminatory hiring 
practices 
its provisions would have been applied to house employees under 
an amendment offered by rep steve bartlett rtexas the provision 
found support among republicans who are critics of the overall bill 
while democrats who are trying to speed action on the bill were the 
chief opponents of the amendment 
the debate came as hayes and other lawmakers called for speedy 
action on the legislation the chairman rep augustus hawkins 
dcalif is hoping for final action by the education and labor 
panel tuesday the bill then goes to the house judiciary committee 
senators and house members traditionally have guarded their 
patronage powers and have exempted their offices from fairhiring 
bills 
rep william clay dmo suggested that bartlett had something 
mischievous in mind when he offered the amendment 
i think its a question of motivation clay said i doubt 
its the gentlemans intention to modify the bill to the point 
where he will cast a vote for it 
if he were sincere he would include the senate in this as 
well clay said 
that brought rep william f goodling rpa the panels 
ranking republican to his feet to demand that clay strike his 
words from the record i dont think i want to sit in a situation 
where we are questioning each others motives he said he said 
such questioning violated a house rule 
clay however refused to recant 
lets go im leaving said goodling walking out but 
within a few minutes clay asked to have his words stricken from the 
record and goodling was back at his place in the committee room

destruction of intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles by the united states and the soviet union is proceeding on 
schedule and should be completed in a year arms control officials 
said thursday 
the officials told the senate foreign relations committee that 
two years into the threeyear process the soviets have destroyed 
1615 missiles or 86 percent of the total called for in the 1987 
intermediate range nuclear forces treaty 
the united states has destroyed 486 missiles about 57 percent 
of the number that must be eliminated by june 1 1991 under the 
agreement said gen roland lajoie director of the pentagons 
onsite inspection agency 
because the soviets have more multiplewarhead missiles they 
still have about twice as many warheads deployed as the united 
states lajoie said 
all indications are that all missiles will have been 
destroyed by both sides by the treaty deadline he told the 
committee 
ronald f lehman ii director of the arms control and 
disarmament agency said the united states is also still trying to 
find out how some soviet ss23 intermediaterange missiles were 
transferred to warsaw pact countries and eluded initial detection 
by us treaty negotiators 
we have to establish ownership whose are they lehman 
said and are there warheads for these missiles controlled by the 
soviet union theres not an obvious picture yet 
east germany has invited us inspectors to inspect the missiles 
in question and information also has been received from bulgaria 
he said although the missiles are capable of carrying nuclear 
warheads the countries involved have said they carry only 
conventional armaments lehman said 
lehman also acknowledged that satellite photos have picked up 
ss4related equipment at an undeclared site which could 
violate the missile treaty 
it depends what was operationally deployed at the time of the 
treaty lehman said we cant say that in and of itself it is 
inconsistent with the treaty we have to find out the facts

president hashemi rafsanjani of iran said 
thursday the groups holding hostages in lebanon released two 
americans at irans prodding but that the united states was still 
acting like a spoiled child 
he also said iran is not restoring diplomatic ties with the 
united states 
robert polhill 55 of new york was freed april 22 and eight 
days later a second us educator held hostage frank reed 57 of 
malden mass was freed 
rafsanjani said the kidnappers released the two at our 
suggestion they could have rejected our advice but they 
accepted our advice 
in his speech to a group of teachers in tehran irans capital 
rafsanjani compared the us response to that of a stubborn 
frustrated child 
the speech was carried by tehran radio and monitored in nicosia 
president bush told a news conference in washington thursday he 
was cheered by the release of polhill and reed but was unwilling 
to make any conciliatory gestures toward iran at this time 
bush has repeatedly declared he will not negotiate with iran or 
the lebanese shiite moslem kidnappers for the release of hostages 
but he did promise to help iran get details on the fate of four 
iranian diplomats kidnapped in lebanon in 1982 calling it a 
goodwill gesture and not an attempt to bargain for us hostages 
this is something they feel very strongly about bush said 
theyve mentioned it to us several different times 
sixteen westerners including six americans are missing in 
lebanon most are believed held by groups controlled by hezbollah 
the iranianfinanced party of god longest held is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent of the associated press kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher on thursday welcomed 
syrias and irans role in gaining freedom for polhill and reed 
but said britain will not deal with hostagetakers 
she is under pressure to secure the release of british hostages 
in lebanon three britons and an irishman with dual british and 
irish citizenship are held including terry waite special envoy of 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
rafsanjani said thursday that an angry revolutionary enraged 
group after it released one hostage without preconditions and 
was confronted with americas irresponsible reaction should 
reasonably have taken revenge 
but they still showed decency and showed their extreme 
goodwill by freeing reed as well 
american bullies instead of being impressed by the move 
reiterated their previous stance 
rafsanjani acknowledged that bush expressed appreciation 
publicly to iran and syria for their role but said his 
administration on the other hand started a vile propaganda 
move stating we will not normalize ties until iran releases all 
hostages 
rafsanjani said iran was not interested in restoring relations 
and denied western press reports that tehran helped secure the two 
recent releases because it needs to resume diplomatic ties with the 
united states 
iran does not want relations with the united states and we 
welcomed severing ties he said we are not prepared to talk to 
america 
a dispatch thursday from irans official islamic republic news 
agency said arbitration talks between america and iran in the 
netherlands were focusing only on legal issues 
the two sides have been working for nine years to settle 
financial disputes stemming from the 1979 islamic revolution irna 
said a statement from the delegation stressed that no other 
topics either political or economic have been or will be 
discussed 
rafsanjanis comments thursday appeared to rule out a possible 
dialogue with the united states to end 11 years of hostility 
but they also indicated that rafsanjani leader of those seeking 
broader contacts for iran was under mounting pressure from 
antiwesterners angered at irans role in the release of the two 
americans 
rafsanjani praised the groups in lebanon for taking the 
initiative on the releases and castigated washington saying 
instead of giving an appropriate reward for this initiative the 
us reacted by saying it will not negotiate with kidnappers as if 
israel and the lebanese phalangists are not kidnappers 
he was referring to arabs held by israel including hezbollah 
leader sheik abdulkarim obeid who was seized in lebanon on july 
28 lebanese christian militiamen the armed wing of the phalangist 
party seized the four missing iranians in july 1982 
in wiesbaden west germany us military officials said reed 
will head home friday after spending thursday undergoing further 
debriefings by a special team seeking clues about other westerner 
hostages 
reeds daughter by an earlier marriage marilyn langston said 
in malden thursday that during his 43 months in captivity reed was 
told his mother had died and did not learn she was alive until he 
was released this week 
reeds mother 91yearold leota sprague shares an apartment in 
malden with reeds wife fahima and the couples 9yearold son

gerald arpino has resigned as artistic director 
of the joffrey ballet and has withdrawn his works and those of the 
companys founder from the joffreys repertory 
however arpino will continue as artistic director of the 
companys ballet school the schools director said thursday 
the resignation of gerald arpino as artistic director of the 
joffrey ballet in no way affects the joffrey ballet school 
director edith daddario said the school is an independent 
organization and mr arpino is still and will remain the artistic 
director of the joffrey ballet school 
arpino who became artistic director of the ballet company in 
1988 after the death of founder robert joffrey resigned tuesday 
after the joffrey board of directors voted to set up an operating 
committee that would run the company in place of both arpino and 
the 55member board 
ten board members resigned in protest at what one called a 
takeover by businessmen ignorant of artistic matters 
arpino has been a dancer and choreographer with the modern 
ballet company since its early days in the mid1950s however 
critics and dance buffs alike have often called his works 
pedestrian instead of inspired and without structure purpose or 
artistry with the exception of such works as sea shadow 1962 
and viva vivaldi 1965 arpino is considered a secondrate 
choreographer who merely moves dancers around a stage 
in a statement released when he resigned arpino said i 
refuse to participate in an organization which i believe has lost 
its moral and ethical foundation he further said the joffrey may 
no longer use works that belong to him or to robert joffreys 
estate 
the joffrey like many dance companies has financial problems 
based in new york and los angeles it faces a deficit of about 2 
million 
david h murdock cochairman of the joffrey with anthony a 
bliss has agreed to close the deficit with gifts loans and 
fundraising over three years the new york times said the board 
believed his assistance was conditioned on the new operating 
committee being established a board member told the newspaper 
ruth houghton a board member for 23 years was among those who 
quit in protest 
these are businessmen who dont know about artistic things 
she said the thing they dont realize is that with jerry gone 
all the major big heavy contributors who kept the company going 
for years are gone 
bliss defended the move saying the large board paralyzed the 
company as it grappled with a financial crisis right now weve 
got an emergency and weve got to put this through to save the 
company he said

leading members of the house armed services 
committee introduced legislation thursday to reduce the number of 
reports the pentagon is required to send the panel 
defense secretary dick cheney has long complained that 
congress makes the pentagon write too many reports said 
committee chairman les aspin dwis we found out that what dick 
cheney is saying is right 
under the legislation aspin and rep william dickinson of 
alabama ranking republican on the committee will track the number 
of onetime and repetitive reports requested by lawmakers on the 
panel 
aspin and dickinson would then review and decide on the requests 
according to their calculations the legislation would kill 59 
of the 211 recurring reports the department is required to submit 
to congress 
the committee last year requested 133 reports and the senate 
armed services committee asked for 76 reports after the two panels 
negotiated on the final defense budget another 308 reports were 
requested 
the bill will drive a stake through the heart of one quarter 
of all the reports that the pentagon has been required to send 
us aspin said 
joining in support of the legislation were reps nicholas 
mavroules dmass and larry hopkins rky ranking members of

four marine shows that allow human swimmers to 
frolic with dolphins will be allowed to continue on an experimental 
basis a federal agency announced thursday 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations said it 
would allow the swimwiththedolphin program to continue until 
the end of 1991 but only at the four locations where such programs 
now exist 
no new permits however will be issued to other locations at 
this time and no additional dolphins may be captured for use in 
these programs the announcement said 
federal officials said the programs must follow new conditions 
and will be closely monitored 
the announcement said that the national marine fisheries 
service a part of noaa investigated the dolphinswimmer programs 
the agency found no physical evidence that the dolphins involved 
in these programs have suffered more health problems than dolphins 
which are used for public display in aquaria habitats 
three of the dolphin programs are in florida and the fourth is 
in hawaii 
noaa made the ruling after environmental groups expressed 
concern about the health and safety of dolphins in the swim 
programs the marine fisheries service said it received hundreds of 
letters about the dolphinswimmer program during the last six 
months 
officials said the swimwiththedolphin programs will be 
allowed to continue on an experimental basis so more information 
can be obtained on the wellbeing of dolphins participating 
based on this information the programs may be extended beyond 
1991 or discontinued 
the marine fisheries service said it will closely monitor the 
programs to assure that new conditions imposed are followed 
the new conditions include assuring that dolphins are given 
additional rest periods provisions for additional security a 
means for the dolphins to escape from the swimming public and that 
no more than two human swimmers per dolphin will be permitted in 
the water at the same time 
also the new conditions require the training for program staff 
members and forbid any participant to hold pull or grab the 
dolphins

people bid aloha to kalapana on thursday 
as the town was sealed off because of imminent danger from kilauea 
volcanos surging sea of lava 
workers were preparing to move the historic star of the sea 
church to safer ground the kalapana store and drivein cleaned off 
its shelves and stopped serving hot foods after being ordered to 
close 
the lava flow was headed in a direct path toward the center of 
town advancing to within 125 yards of the store and within 250 
yards of the church 
one home burned early thursday bringing to 130 the number 
destroyed since kilauea volcano started its present eruption jan 
3 1983 several more were expected to fall thursday civil defense 
officials said 
george hook owner of the construction company that is 
relocating the church for free said two 20ton hydraulic lifts 
would be used to hoist the termiteridden structure onto a flatbed 
truck 
the church will be taken to a clearing where other relocated 
homes are being stored said sister mary helen who was trying to 
organize a church service somewhere near the church before its 
moved 
we want to bring it to a closure she said right now it 
is a community coming to death 
across the street the kalapana mauna kea congregational church 
awaits its fate church members voted against moving long before 
the flow arrived in this lavaprone area 
if we moved it it would defeat the whole purpose of our 
christian faith said church moderator bernice mckeague there 
is a whole history to it but a church is not a building its the 
people 
the church had planned a final service for thursday night but 
that was cancelled by the 6 pm evacuation order 
the church originally built in 1823 was first destroyed by an 
earthquake lava flow and tidal wave in 1868 it used to stand on 
the site where star of the sea church is but moved across the road 
in the early 1900s mckeague said 
store owner walter yamaguchi 82 who built his drivein 
restaurant in 1963 and his grocery store 11 years later walked 
around and said he would be back 
i leave it up to madame pele the volcano goddess he said 
she will stop 
mary dressler said she had stopped at yamaguchis store nearly 
every day of the 15 years she lived in kalapana gardens subdivision 
to talk with him 
we shared a lot of good times its real sad she said after 
going up to yamaguchi and hugging him i love you she said 
jim halpin who lived in kalapana for six years said he would 
move back as soon as officials let people return something that 
could take years because the lava has to cool 
he stopped at yamaguchis store to say goodbye too 
walters like everybodys uncle he said i came to say 
goodbye and get that last container of chocolate milk

operators of the goddess of democracy said 
thursday the radio ship may seek on humanitarian grounds to dock in 
hong kong but officials of the british colony say it is not 
welcome 
the governor of the british colony said the ship which plans to 
broadcast news music and prodemocracy reports to china from 
international waters off taiwan would be refused entry 
christine dupont spokeswoman for the parisbased boat for china 
foundation said thursday that the projects directors were 
discussing their next move 
already rejected by suppliers in taiwan the ship was seeking 
permission from hong kong to take on a transmitter food fuel and 
water organizers said the converted trawler sailed for hong kong 
on thursday and was expected to arrive in two weeks 
it has been made quite clear to the organizers of the ship 
for a very long time that they would not be welcome in hong kong 
governor david wilson told reporters on thursday 
however dupont said the ship might seek to dock in hong kong 
anyway 
its our understanding that the law of the sea doesnt permit 
anyone to turn away a ship in need of reprovisioning or fuel she 
said to refuse assistance goes against international law 
the vessel left france on march 17 and arrived in singapore on 
wednesday 
it is named after a statue erected by prodemocracy students in 
beijings tiananmen square last spring before the bloody military 
suppression of their movement in june when troops killed hundreds 
of unarmed civilians 
wilson said he did not want hong kong used as a battlefield 
for other peoples political battles adding it would be quite 
inconsistent with that policy to have a ship of that sort coming 
into hong kong 
hong kong reverts to chinese sovereignty in 1997 and is very 
sensitive about relations with beijing which has issued warnings 
about helping the 1200ton ship 
chinas communist leaders who called in the military for a 
deadly crackdown on the prodemocracy movement last june have 
refused to rule out the use of force to stop the ships plans to 
broadcast prodemocracy reports from international waters near 
taiwan 
any attempt by the ship to enter the port of hong kong could be 
dangerous because it is surrounded by chinese territorial waters 
if hong kong remains closed it is not clear if the ship would 
then seek to follow the original plans and dock in the northern 
taiwan port of keelung to take on provisions 
although the nationalist chinese government of taiwan is 
beijings bitter enemy relations between the two sides have been 
warming in recent years and some taiwan officials are reluctant to 
increase tension by assisting the ship 
the goddess of democracy is carrying a crew of 10 french as well 
as several journalists who boarded in singapore 
french journalist christophe nick vice president of the boat 
for china foundation and the ships spokesman said the vessel will 
reach hong kong in about 15 days 
we plan to broadcast from may 23 programs in tibetan 
translated into chinese language because the chinese army entered 
tibet on that day in 1951 he said 
he said funds for the project were obtained from 19 magazines 
and from chinese people in macao hong kong and other areas

polyester postage stamps will be sold through 
automatic teller machines at banks in a sixmonth test beginning 
may 18 in seattle the postal service announced thursday 
spokesman art shealy said the stamps will be testmarketed in a 
joint venture by the postal service and seafirst bank first at 
about 15 seattle locations and then at other seafirst branches in 
washington state 
shealy said the sheets of stamps were designed to be like 
currency so that they could be dispensed the same way cash is 
dispensed through the machines 
he said the sheets each with a dozen 25cent stamps would cost 
3 apiece debited against the customers bank account 
the stamp is designed to be selfadhesive requiring no licking 
shealy said 
we think it answers quite a large portion of the publics 
request for a more convenient stamp he said it is 
humidityresistant so they dont stick together it is really a 
stamp of the future 
if the seattle test is a success shealy said the stamps will 
be tried out nationwide in the spring of 1991 
the postal service already sells stamps through supermarkets and 
other types of store and shealy said selling them through automatic 
teller machines basically is an electromechanical version of 
this system 
we think it is something that our customers want because it 
will enable them to buy their stamps while they are getting cash 
for the weekend without needing to stand in line at a post 
office he said 
he said some surveys showed as many as half of the people 
standing in post office lines early in the morning around noon or 
in the afternoon were there simply to buy stamps 
he said the postal service had increased the number of its 
automatic vending machines and also sells stamps by mail and takes 
orders for them over the telephone the automatic teller machines 
will provide customers with another option he said 
the postal service has ordered a run of two million stamps for 
the test the spokesman said 
he said the stamps are not biodegradable but might be in the 
future 
when the stamp comes out for full national distribution we 
will probably if the technology exists and if the stamp will hold 
up consider a biodegradable product he said in fact we are 
looking to the industry and encouraging them to come out with that 
product

human rights continue to be restricted in 
kenya the state department told congress in an exchange of letters 
made public thursday 
we shall continue to raise these issues with the kenyan 
authorities and press for positive action said assistant 
secretary janet g mullins in a letter released by the office of 
rep gus yatron dpa chairman of the house human rights 
subcommittee 
the last year brought to kenya an even further erosion in 
respect for civil liberties and political rights the department 
said quoting from its 1989 report on human rights around the world 
at the time kenyan president daniel arap moi visited washington 
three months ago yatron had sent letters to the state department 
and to kenyan ambassador denis d afande expressing concern over 
reports of troubling developments in kenya he mentioned reported 
forced repatriation beatings attacks and threats against kenyans 
of somali origin constitutional amendments weakening the tenure of 
judges restrictions on the daily nation newspaper other pressures 
against journalists and a shoot to kill policy against poachers 
and bandits 
the state department said it shared yatrons concern about 
judicial tenure because we hold an independent judiciary central 
to the definition and protection of human rights 
kenyas constitutional amendment allowing for two weeks of 
detention for capital offenses and the actions taken by the 
government to restrict the press are troubling ms mullins added 
in her letter to yatron 
with regard to the deportation of somali refugees a positive 
development in this crisis has been the kenyan governments allowal 
of both the un high commissioner for refugees and the red cross 
to travel in the area it added

the senate moved thursday toward allowing the 
nations 3 million federal civil service and postal workers to 
participate more in party politics despite a threatened veto by 
president bush 
on a 6730 vote democrats defeated an amendment by senate 
republicans aimed at derailing a bill to remove most of the 
restrictions on political activities by federal employees imposed 
by the 1939 hatch act 
the democratic bill would revise the law to lift prohibitions 
that bar federal civil service employees from holding office in 
political parties working in campaigns or soliciting campaign 
dollars from fellow workers 
however it would continue prohibitions on federal workers 
running for public office soliciting campaign funds from the 
general public or engaging in political activities while on the job 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
current restrictions illogical and unnecessary 
federal employees have been denied many of the basic rights of 
freedom of expressing and action enjoyed by millions of other 
american citizens he said citing prohibitions against 
participating in phone banks and other political operations 
the republican amendment by sen william roth rdel would 
have substituted the proposed changes with an order directing the 
office of personnel management to simplify and clarify what 
roth acknowledged are confusing regulations under the law 
roth said the bill would risk a return to the spoils system 
because civil service workers would feel compelled in the 
competition for promotions and pay raises to exercise their new 
political rights to please their politically appointed 
superior 
the house approved similar but broader legislation on a 29790 
vote more than a year ago its bill also would allow federal 
employees to seek and hold political offices and solicit campaign 
funds from the public 
congress passed nearly identical legislation in 1976 but it was 
vetoed by thenpresident gerald ford who contended it would 
politicize the civil service because workers would inevitably 
feel compelled to engage in partisan political activities 
the bush administration makes the same contention officials in 
the justice department the office of personnel management and 
white house budget office all said they would urge president bush 
to veto any change in the current law saying it would undermine 
th integrity and independence of the traditionally nonpartisan 
civil service 
the original hatch act was passed during the new deal era in 
response to overzealous political appointees of president franklin 
d roosevelt requiring enrollees in the works progress 
administration to contribute to the 1938 reelection campaign of 
then democratic sen alben barkley of kentucky

constipation by a televison commercial that showed a toilet turning 
into a biting monster 
dr virgilio r pilapil writing in the april issue of 
pediatrics said a 3yearold boy was brought to his office for 
treatment of constipation after the youngster refused to use the 
family bathroom at home 
the childs functions had all been normal throughout his short 
life and he had been thoroughly toilet trained for six months the 
doctor said 
but then the boy started refusing to move his bowels and 
eventually would do so only in a diaper while standing up and he 
refused to say why the sudden change in habits 
finally pilapil writes he gave in to his mothers 
constant asking and told her that he had seen a television 
commercial in which a toilet bowl was portrayed as turning into 
a monster with the seat cover making a chomping movement 
this image scared him from again sitting on the toilet the 
doctor wrote he feared it would get him 
pilapil said the patient is now being encouraged to use the 
toilet and the family is having some success although not

opec ministers unanimously agreed thursday to cut 
the cartels total crude output by 145 million barrels a day to 
help maintain oil prices at a minimum of 18 a barrel 
but oil prices fell quickly and sharply amid skepticism that the 
cut would actually materialize analysts noted that even if opec 
succeeded the action wouldnt be enough to solve the current oil 
glut problem 
opec wont manage to cut production that much said geoff 
pyne an analyst with the london investment firm ubs phillips and 
drew it might only be between 500000 and 1 million barrels a 
day 
peter nicol an oil analyst with the london investment firm 
warburg securities noted that although members sound serious 
about trying to cut production to boost oil prices they face a 
difficult task because the market is really awash at the moment 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil fell 55 cents in london late thursday to 1590 a barrel 
the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude fell 69 cents to settle at 1799 a barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
although all 13 members will reduce their crude production opec 
president sadek boussena said the cartels chronic quota violators 
would contribute most to the cutback by returning to their official 
ceilings for the first half of the year 
the united arab emirates which analysts say is a repeated 
cheater agreed to cut its output by 200000 barrels a day 
boussena said the agreement reached on the second day of an 
emergency session will be in effect until the end of july 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries postponed its 
regular midyear session for a month to july 25 when it will decide 
its output and pricing policy for the rest of the year he said 
opec pumped 235 million barrels a day in april boussena said 
the cartels official ceiling is 221 million barrels 
for the time being we decided to have a freezetime for three 
months said boussena who also serves as algerias oil minister 
he did not provide a breakdown of the agreed cutbacks 
analysts have said overproduction by saudi arabia kuwait and 
the united arab emirates was responsible for the oil glut at a time 
when demand traditionally eases off in the second quarter 
oil prices will remain under pressure for the next two or three 
months the analysts predicted i think we have to wait for 
winter restocking and winter demand to turn things around pyne

for the second time in 24 hours someone 
tried to burn down the campaign headquarters of former gov evan 
mecham police said thursday 
investigators said the second attempt took place about 1 am 
thursday when an arsonist threw a burning container onto the roof 
of the offices 
police lt randy henderlite said the object resembled a molotov 
cocktail which is a gasolinefilled bottle with a makeshift wick 
attached 
the first attempt about 3 am wednesday caused about 
30000 damage mostly to the roof investigators said thursdays 
arson caused an additional 5000 loss 
i dont feel too good about it said mecham who is running 
for the republican nomination for governor even though he was 
impeached and removed from office two years ago 
he said the headquarters would remain open 
in the past week three large houses in phoenix have been 
firebombed in similar attacks but police to date have nothing to 
indicate they were the work of one arsonist or were linked to the 
attack on mechams offices henderlite said 
mechams headquarters faces foreclosure and auction by the 
federal deposit insurance corp may 18 unless he can work out a 
deal to repay a 460000 loan on the property records show 
among the possibilities being investigated by detectives was 
whether the threat of foreclosure had anything to do with the 
fires henderlite said

oprah winfrey says she had a premature baby when 
she was 14 but that the baby died shortly after birth 
in the may 6 issue of parade magazine the talkshow host says 
it greatly saddens her to confirm a published story based on an 
interview with her deeply disturbed halfsister patricia lloyd 
it is true that when i was 14 years old i became pregnant 
winfrey said the baby was born prematurely and died shortly 
after birth the experience was the most emotional confusing and 
traumatic of my young life 
i had hoped that this matter could stay private until i was 
fully able to deal with my own deep emotions and feelings so that 
i could share this experience in a way that could best help educate 
other young girls who are trying to cope with all the ramifications 
of sexual abuse 
winfrey 36 also said she was distressed that any publication 
would pay her halfsister for the story she described lloyd as a 
drugdependent deeply disturbed individual 
parade did not identify the publication or when the story 
appeared 
my heart goes out to my halfsister who is obviously in a lot 
of pain winfrey said

latvias legislature on thursday began 
debating whether to declare independence from the soviet union 
exhorted by lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis to be 
strong and have courage 
landsbergis said he came to the neighboring baltic republic to 
be with my brothers he said latvians if they moved more slowly 
than lithuania on the path to secession would be trudging 
through a jungle 
i see and feel that latvia wont retreat from the principle of 
independence landsbergis said in separate remarks to latvian 
radio 
pro and antiindependence protesters surrounded the latvian 
deputies as they entered the parliament building 
about 50 soviet army officers who live in latvia gathered with 
signs proclaiming the people and the army are united and we 
wont go the way of lithuania 
a few steps away proindependence protesters carried banners 
saying the soviet army must go home and independence for 
latvia protesters carried soviet flags or the redandwhite 
latvian flag 
the latvian supreme soviet or legislature debated procedural 
questions a vote on independence was likely friday lawmakers from 
the separatist peoples front predicted they could muster the 
twothirds majority need 
there are 201 members of the latvian supreme soviet but only 
197 will vote on independence because of four disputed seats 
stemming from the march election a twothirds majority of 132 
votes is needed to pass the independence measure 
a spokeswoman for the peoples front said thursday the measure 
is supported by more than 140 deputies 
anatoly gorbunov who was reelected president of latvia at 
thursdays session backed independence in a nomination speech 
i believe that the renewal of a legally sovereign nation must 
be accomplished he said declaring it a normal way of life for 
all the residents of latvia 
gorbunov a 48yearold former communist party functionary who 
has shown himself skilled at negotiating with moscow won 153 votes 
out of 196 cast 
he warned that the republic could not expect help from the west 
the world on account of 5 million baltic people is not going 
to risk what has been done in the area of arms control and by 
mikhail gorbachev he said 
in washington lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
said before a meeting with president bush that her republic would 
be willing to suspend independence measures opposed by moscow if it 
had western guarantees of support for its sovereignty 
lithuania is enduring a kremlin economic embargo imposed in 
response to ts independence declaration officials of landsbergis 
government said thursday that shortages were beginning to hit 
medical supplies 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia said thursday that 
rationing is being introduced in lithuania with each person 
entitled to two kilograms 44 pounds of flour cereals butter 
and sugar a month and that a monthly limit was set on how much 
could be taken out of a bank account 
izvestias report was quoted by the soviet news agency tass 
landsbergis told reporters he thought latvians would eventually 
achieve independence by a slower more difficult path than 
lithuania he said they were agonizing over their relationship with 
moscow and appeared to be trudging through a jungle 
because of latvias delicate ethnic balance the step could be 
less radical than lithuanias declaration of independence march 11 
in lithuania 80 percent of the 38 million people are ethnic 
lithuanian but about 54 percent of latvias population of 27 
million people are latvian most of the rest are ethnic russians 
many of whom oppose independence 
in the past year latvia has followed lithuanias lead in 
december it abolished the communist partys guaranteed monopoly on 
power in february it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its 
annexation by the soviet union and last month a large segment of 
its communist party broke from its moscowbased parent the steps 
followed similar lithuanian actions 
the latvians are taking a slower approach to independence 
however one proposal calls for an undefined transition of several 
years before full independence estonia also set an undefined 
transition period in a declaration march 30 
the latvian proposal adopts four articles from the republics 
1922 constitution establishing an independent and democratic 
republic the historic territory of latvia giving power to the 
people and establishing a sovereign latvian parliament 
it also recognizes the legitimacy of soviet laws that do not 
contradict the republics own law 
gorbunov said the proposal took into account talks that already 
have begun with moscow 
latvias economics minister janis aboltins told tass it was 
essential that latvia avoid economic sanctions like those brought 
against lithuuania 
the soviet union would painlessly do without our 15 percent2 
percent of the countrys overall output while latvia could be 
hurt badly he said 
svetlana marushchenko of the antiindependence interfront 
movement who protested at the supreme soviet warned that if 
latvia declares independence it will doom latvians to poverty for 
decades

a 4milewide brush fire raced through bonedry 
everglades sawgrass thursday jumping a canal and threatening an 
ecological buffer zone that protects everglades national park 
were in big trouble it jumped a levee 50 feet wide said 
state ranger gene dempsey theres nothing slowing it down 
theres no water holes no breaks 
the fire driven westward by 15 mph winds and fueled by sawgrass 
parched by floridas twoyear drought had spread to 24000 acres 
or more than 37 square miles by early afternoon 
by jumping the canal the blaze moved into the everglades 
wildlife management area an uninhabited 150000acre buffer zone 
established to protect plants and wildlife in everglades national 
park it also was headed toward big cypress national preserve 
the fire located about 30 miles northwest of miami and about 15 
miles south of big cypress didnt threaten any inhabited areas 
our main hope was to stop it there dempsey said the next 
canal is about 12 miles away 
the wildfire was one of three burning around miami 
a 10500acre fire within everlades national park itself 
southwest of miami remained active thursday but firefighters from 
a federal team from asheville nc were confident they could 
control it said park spokeswoman darlene koontz 
she said they had determined the park fire was manmade either 
by arson or accident 
seminole indian firefighters were trying to control a smaller 
blaze on their reservation in broward county said dempsey so far 
they did not need state help 
fires are a normal part of the everglades ecology said park 
spokeswoman pat tolle said but this years big fires worry 
environmentalists because the drought has left the region so dry 
areas that usually would be bypassed by brush fires are threatened 
if the smaller park fire to the south spread westward for 
instance it could threaten the nesting sites of the endangered 
cape sable seaside sparrow a groundnesting bird said ms tolle 
the fires also could threaten hardwood hammocks small forested 
islands raised slightly above the marshland that are host to rare 
orchids as well as certain species of tree snails that could not 
flee 
but generally speaking the larger animals the mobile animals 
have already left the drier areas she said when you go in 
after the fire there is very little evidence of dead or injured 
animals

the identity of washingtons hangman can 
be kept secret a judge ruled thursday 
thurston county superior court judge daniel berschauer found 
that disclosure of the mans identity probably would block 
execution of convicted triple murderer charles rodman campbell 
prison officials believe the executioner to be the nations only 
qualified hangman and he has made it clear he will perform the job 
only if his identity and hometown are kept secret the judge said 
the undisputed evidence is that the state could not proceed 
with an execution if disclosure were made he said 
the american civil liberties union said it would quickly appeal 
the aclu had filed a request with state prison authorities 
seeking the name and qualifications of the hangman the state 
responded by suing the aclu and requesting an injunction against 
releasing the name 
campbell whose case is on appeal was sentenced to die for the 
1982 stabbing deaths of barbara hendrickson renae wicklund and 
wicklunds 8yearold daughter shannah the two women testified 
against campbell in 1976 when he was convicted of sexually 
assaulting wicklund the killings took place after he was freed 
from prison 
assistant attorney general aaron owada welcomed the decision 
both owada and the judge stressed that they support public 
disclosure as a general principle but they said state law allows a 
narrow exemption in cases where disclosure would not be in the 
public interest and would hamper a vital governmental function 
the judge said he was balancing the publics right to know with 
the right to have government run properly 
we are a society of law and if the executive branch is 
prohibited from enforcing lawful court orders such as an execution 
order then indeed there can be damage to the vital public 
interest berschauer said in ruling from the bench 
aclu attorney stephen strong told the court the information is 
in the public interest and that the prison system has issued only 
hearsay evidence that the executioner might bow out if his identity 
was released the states 1500 contract with the man says only 
that the state would try its best to keep his name secret he said 
if the state paid enough money it could find somebody 
tomorrow somebody from south africa for instance where they hang 
people all the time aclu official jerry sheehan said in a later 
interview 
the judge declined to rule on the constitutionality of hanging 
washington also allows a convict to choose death by lethal 
injection campbell has yet to indicate a preference so the state 
has to prepare for both styles of execution 
campbell came within hours of execution last year but won a 
stay from the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco a 
final ruling is pending from the court 
washingtons last execution by hanging was in 1963 the last 
such execution in the nation was in iowa in 1965

a set of six 18th century silver candleholders 
sold by royalty fetched nearly 19 million on thursday the 
auction house sothebys said it was a recordsetting price for a 
set of english silver 
the candleholders or sconces were sold by a member of an 
unidentified royal family sothebys said it had been asked not to 
identify the seller whose father had bought the wall sconces in 
1931 
they had been auctioned in 1921 by descendants of the original 
owner for 15000 sothebys said rahim sadat owner of london 
silver dealers armitage ltd paid 189 million for the 16inch 
high candleholders known as the dunham massey sconces 
it was a lot of money but i thought they were cheap at 
that price sadat said 
the sconces which each hold a single candle were were made by 
peter archambo in london in 1730 for george booth 2nd earl of 
warrington a notable silver collector they bear elaborate figures 
from classical mythology 
the earl kept the sconces in a room known as the great 
bedchamber at his dunham massey mansion in cheshire northwest 
england 
the sconces are beautiful and unique with a splendid noble 
provenance and are probably the most important set of english 
silver i have handled in 15 years sadat said 
sothebys had put a top estimate of 164 million on the 
sconces the auction house attributed the price to high quality and 
the rarity of a set of six pieces surviving together for 260 years 
at christies new york sadat paid a world record price for a 
single piece of silver on april 19 when he bought a 17th century 
sicilian table fountain for 198 million

trustees at mills college voted thursday 
to admit male undergraduates for the first time in the schools 
138year history triggering cries of no no from hundreds of 
angry tearful female students 
we will not accept this we have been betrayed said robyn 
fisher president of the associated students of mills college 
the trustees hoping to avoid dipping heavily into the exclusive 
schools endowment to offset declining revenues had been 
considering the move for some time 
if mills is to maintain academic quality and financial 
strength in the long run it must increase its undergraduate 
enrollment to at least 1000 said board chairman warren f 
hellman a san francisco investment banker he refused to reveal 
the breakdown of the vote by the 35member board 
although men have been admitted to mills graduate programs for 
many years a majority of the faculty had opposed the change and 
its hard to find a student who favors the idea 
several women at the school have even shaved their heads in 
protest 
hellmans voice was all but drowned out by angry shouts as he 
made the announcement from a podium in grassy mills common where 
students had been summoned by chapel bells to hear the news 
mills has been the center of strong women and encouraged them 
to speak out said junior beckie albright who said she wont be 
returning next year we deal with men in bars and in social 
situations we dont want them in our classrooms 
dr mary s metz the schools president expects the first men 
to enroll in the fall of 1991 
mills accepts todays vote as a challenge to create a new 
model of coeducation that moves beyond conventional views of women 
and men and their roles in society she said 
before the vote peter mirijanian spokesman for the womens 
college coalition in washington dc said male undergraduates 
would ruin an atmosphere that gives female students leadership 
roles they have trouble attaining at coed colleges 
the whole environment on a campus changes when men are 
admitted no matter how hard the school tries to prevent that 
mirijanian said male students are taken more seriously and women 
suffer 
anita pampusch president of the coalition and of st 
catherines womens college in st paul minn added 
there is so much evidence that womens colleges do something 
special for women it would be a great shame if we did away with 
them women have always occupied a somewhat secondary role at 
womens colleges they could occupy a primary role 
the faculty voted 5726 against the plan which is intended to 
increase the undergraduate count from 777 to 1000 at the quiet 
treelined campus 
administrators say going coed ultimately will save the liberal 
arts school one of three womens colleges in california and 94 in 
the nation there were 298 allfemale colleges 30 years ago 
its not a question of immediate death to the college if we 
dont go coed but the school will decline said mills 
spokeswoman vickie bates 
enrollment in mills 33 undergraduate programs is down 42 
percent from three years ago said school economists 
that contrasts with nationwide figures according to the womens 
college coalition fulltime undergraduate enrollment at womens 
colleges is up this year by 35 percent and parttime enrollments 
increased by 23 percent 
hellman the board chairman said the college must go coed to 
avoid relying too heavily on its 70 million endowment fund 
endowment revenues contribute 20 percent of the schools budget 
compared to 6 percent to 7 percent at most institutions he said 
but fisher remained unconvinced 
the institution has made it through financial crunches in the 
past without going coed she said

the united states said thursday that 
fighting drug trafficking cannot justify violating national and 
international law an apparent reference to the kidnap of a 
mexican doctor linked to a drug murder 
us ambassador jonathan moore representative to the un 
economic and social council did not specifically mention the 
incident involving dr alberto alvarez machain which has strained 
usmexican relations 
moore told delegates the united states believes pursuit of the 
drug menace cannot be used as a justification for violating the 
fundamental precepts of national and international law 
alvarez machain was captured in mexico by mexican bounty hunters 
on april 2 and turned over to the drug enforcement administration 
in the united states he was linked to the torturemurder of dea 
agent enrique camarena in mexico in 1985 
the united states has admitted no complicity in the crossborder 
kidnapping 
on wednesday mexicos ambassador jorge montano referred 
indirectly to the doctors abduction 
montano called for antinarcotics efforts to respect national 
sovereignty and territorial integrity and internal legislation 
he emphasized it is contradictory that certain countries 
which have a high level of drug consumption and growing internal 
production instead of joining the collective fight instead are 
acting outside the most elementary norms of international rights 
montano said mexico contends that a us supreme court decision 
of feb 28 which supported us agents abroad is an 
authorization to commit actions violating sovereignty of other 
countries 
he said mexican authorities will keep cooperating in fighting 
drug trafficking but will not allow anybody drug dealers or 
those prosecuting them to violate the rights and laws of mexico 
on thursday moore said a recent international session against 
drug trafficking recognized that no country can deal with this 
scourge alone or isolate itself from its effects 
the economic and social council is following up the general 
assembly in february and a meeting in london on issues arising from 
the illegal drug trade 
moore urged all nations to ratify the un convention against 
traffic in illicit drugs and psychotropic substances he said un 
drug control agencies have major and growing roles in international 
narcotics control

lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
appealed to president bush on thursday to formally recognize her 
governments independence from moscow 
i think hes going to see how events unfold there and hes 
going to take decisions which are compatible with us soviet and 
lithuanian interests she said 
bush said at a news conference shortly before the 45minute oval 
office meeting that he sees no role for the united states as a 
mediator between lithuania and moscow 
but mrs prunskiene speaking at a reception as her long day of 
toplevel meetings and public appeals drew to a close said that 
her countrymen expect more than that from bush 
i made it clear to president bush that the lithuanian nation 
is awaiting basic support from him she told an audience at the 
conservative heritage foundation 
i dont think the president is at all indifferent to the 
lithuanian cause she said he is however concerned with some 
of the complexities that surround this issue 
she said that what lithuania most needs if it accepts a 
proposal made by france and west germany to slow the implementation 
of independence are international guarantees that talks with 
moscow will in fact lead to independence 
president bushs involvement in this process would be very 
helpful she said 
only time will tell whether her white house meeeting was 
productive she said adding i have not lost hope 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush told mrs 
prunskiene to take back to lithuania this message 
i am personally and the united states government is 
committed to the selfdetermination of the people of lithuania 
the white house has said mrs prunskienes visit was unofficial 
but fitzwater said bush was pleased to get a firsthand account of 
the conditions in lithuania 
bush fitzwater said repeated the 50year us policy of 
refusing to recognize the forcible incorporation of the baltic 
states into the ussr 
he urged all parties to enter into a good faith dialogue he 
stressed our desire to see the situation in lithuania resolved 
peacefully and without intimidation he emphasized the deep 
commitment of the american people to freedom and democracy around 
the world and the further progress of reform in the soviet union 
mrs prunskiene was asked if she endorsed a comment by 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis that bushs refusal to 
impose sanctions against the soviet union was tantamount to 
another munich 
landsbergis said it reminded him of the 1938 meeting in munich 
at which neville chamberlain the british prime minister met with 
adolf hitler and agreed to let hitler take over germanspeaking 
areas of czechoslovkia in the interest of peace in our time 
munich has been a symbol of sellout ever since 
i dont think that comparing it with munich was the best 
choice of words she said but she added 
one must understand that what he said was said because 
lithuania has a great desire for independence and hopes that the 
west will support the drive to reach that independence 
earlier mrs prunskiene said the upcoming summit between bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev could be a crucial 
turning point 
fate is giving them the chance to make an admirable mark on 
history she said 
mrs prunskiene had said the independence crisis in lithuania 
can be resolved if strong international pressure is brought on 
gorbachev to permit genuine democracy in the soviet union 
even the worlds darling does not have the monopolistic right 
to decide the fate of other nations she said referring to 
gorbachev 
greeted with a standing ovation as she opened public testimony 
on capitol hill the 47yearold prime minister acknowledged that 
gorbachev would prefer that lithuania remain within the soviet 
federation although not by force 
however she said the united states and the world dont have to 
choose between the soviet leader ad the breakaway republic 
the solution is this gorbachev and a breakthrough for 
democracy in the soviet union and an independent lithuania she 
said these two are compatible and converging sides of the same 
process rather than alternatives 
it is difficult for the west to perceive that pressuring mr 
gorbachev helps rather than hinders 
international pressure mrs prunskiene said can help gorbachev 
become a consistent practitioner of democracy and overcome 
reactionary forces inside the soviet union 
mrs prunskiene delivered her testimony before the commission on 
security and cooperation in europe the socalled helsinki 
commission formed in 1975 to monitor soviet compliance with its 
human rights commitments 
meeting over breakfast with members of the house foreign affairs 
committee mrs prunskiene said lithuania is prepared for 
compromises in those negotiations but cannot and will not 
revoke our declaration of independence 
we also hope for international guarantees of this declaration 
of independence which we have made she said i wish to 
emphasize that we believe that only with these international 
guarantees the soviets will begin negotiations 
while appearing before the helsinki commission she said 
we could temporarily suspend the quick and unilateral 
execution of legislation implementing the independence 
declaration she said if there were international guarantees 
in such a case lithuania would have to be guaranteed on the 
basis of international law the continuity of lithuanian

efforts to restrict further log exports from 
government lands won unanimous approval thursday from a key house 
committee as backers of the plan predicted it will win passage 
through congress 
the house foreign affairs committee sent the export 
administration act to the full house with an amendment that would 
ban the lucrative export of rawlogs from all state lands in oregon 
and threefourths of such lands in washington 
the export controls are necessary to keep domestic mills 
operating while setting aside millions of acres to protect 
oldgrowth forests needed to save the rare northern spotted owl 
from extinction said rep john miller rwash 
in the past panel members have opposed measures that would 
allow states to ban exports of commodities on the basis that the 
federal government has the sole power to set us trade policy 
but miller said the proposal approved thursday gets around that 
problem by directing the commerce secretary to implement the state 
bans and preserving president bushs authority to nulify the bans 
if they conflict with federal policy 
ive got to say it went better than we ever expected miller 
said after the meeting i expect it will be coming to the floor 
quickly 
i dont expect there will be any opposition on the floor 
said rep les aucoin dore

nato foreign ministers insisted 
thursday that a united germany must remain in the western alliance 
but sought to reassure moscow that soviet security interests would 
not be hurt as a result 
our message is clear its not a question of winning or losing 
at the end there must be only winners nato secretarygeneral 
manfred woerner said at the end of a special alliance meeting on 
german unification 
the soviet union will not lose it will win in stability and 
it will win partners in security he told reporters 
secretary of state james a baker iii agreed a stable united 
germany within secure borders and as part of a free alliance is a 
loss for no one 
woerner said the ministers were unanimous in insisting on nato 
membership for a unified germany 
west germany already is a member of the 16nation north atlantic 
treaty organization but east germany belongs to the sovietled 
warsaw pact more than 380000 red army troops are stationed on 
east german soil 
moscow wants the new central european state to be militarily 
nonaligned soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze suggests 
that the new nation belong to both alliances 
woerner ruled out dualmembership saying it would lead to a 
sort of neutrality 
it is clear that this is not acceptable to us he said 
baker suggested that with a us decision to speed up the 
timetable for ussoviet negotiations on slashing tactical nuclear 
forces in europe the kremlin might ease its opposition to nato 
membership for the new germany 
theres a recognition on the part of the nato alliance that 
circumstances are changing baker told a news conference 
the nato foreign ministers met two days before the start of the 
twoplusfour discussions on a united germany which include 
the four world war ii allies britain france the united states 
and the soviet union and the two germanys 
the special nato meeting was called after smaller alliance 
nations especially italy belgium and the netherlands complained 
about being left out of the twoplusfour process 
woerner said nato did not intend to expand its forces into the 
current territory of east germany but that the western sector would 
continue to belong to natos joint military structure 
he said a united germany will renounce the possession of 
nuclear and chemical weapons as both present german states have 
done 
no discriminatory measures should be applied to the new state 
woerner said without elaborating 
baker said the twoplusfour group would discuss various 
issues about german reunification but that its membership in nato 
could only be decided by the alliance and the merged nation 
a nato statement said thursday that woerner will meet with 
president bush baker and defense secretary dick cheney during a 
twoday visit to washington starting next monday and would also 
meet with congressional leaders and national security adviser brent 
scowcroft 
woerner will proceed to canada for a may 910 meeting of nato 
defense ministers near calgary alberta on nuclear arms policy

senate democrats proposed thursday that the 
public finance nearly half the cost of senate campaigns and that 
political action committees be prohibited from contributing 
directly to candidates 
the revised campaign reform bill which party leaders said they 
will bring to the senate floor next week retains spending ceilings 
vehemently opposed by most republicans but raises them about 20 
percent above what democrats had first proposed 
democratic leaders unveiled their package just two days after 
republicans rushed out a counterproposal endorsed by 34 of the 45 
gop senators 
under the democratic plan about 70 percent of a candidates 
general election campaign expenses but none of the costs for 
primary races would be paid by the government from funds raised 
through a proposed 3 checkoff on income tax returns 
since the middle 1970s tax returns have included a checkoff 
that allows taxpayers to designate 1 of their taxes to a fund for 
financing presidential campaigns 
the new checkoff in contrast would require the taxpayer to pay 
more taxpayers could voluntarily give up 3 of their refunds or 
add 3 to the taxes they owe to go into a special government 
account to finance congressional campaigns 
the new democraticproposed ceilings on senate campaigns would 
range from 19 million in small states to slightly more than 10 
million in the largest california sponsors said it would 
basically cut in half the amount now being spent 
the gop plan would abolish union and corporate pacs entirely and 
cut the amount that issueoriented pacs can contribute to campaigns 
by 80 percent but republicans would leave unlimited the aggregate 
amounts that candidates and the two parties can raise from 
individual donors and spend on elections 
the only meaningful way to reform is to have limits on 
campaign spending said senate democratic leader george mitchell 
of maine anything less than that avoids the real issues and 
simply creates the illusion of reform 
with revised proposals from both parties now on the table the 
door is open for mitchell republican leader bob dole and their 
representatives to begin serious negotiations 
we still hope we can reach a bipartisan agreement mitchell 
said i hope we can engage in discussions in the very near 
future 
oklahoma sen david boren the chief author of the democratic 
package said he doesnt expect those talks to begin before the 
bill is brought to the senate floor monday or tuesday 
everything is negotiable from our point of view except that 
we have to have some limit on overall spending or that money will 
pop up in some other way boren said 
the initial reaction from republicans was disdain 
i cant believe this is a serious proposal said kentucky 
sen mitch mcconnell the chief author of the gop measure 
including house races taxpayers would pick up a 400 million tab 
each election cycle for an incumbents protection bill 
while both democrats and republicans have retreated from a 
bipartisan compromise suggested two months ago by a panel of 
academic experts and professional campaign fundraisers for both 
sides boren said he still rates the odds at 2to1 that the senate 
will pass a bill 
i think we could very well have enough republican votes to 
prevent a repeat of the successful filibuster gop senators mounted 
two years ago against a campaign reform bill boren said 
but thats not enough he added its not going to be 
enacted if its not agreeable to george bush the president doesnt 
want any pacs but i dont think hes hung up on the details 
currently there is a 10000 limit on how much union corporate 
and issueoriented pacs can give to a candidate 
the republican bill would outlaw labor and corporate pacs 
which in recent years have overwhelmingly funneled their 
contributions to incumbent democratic lawmakers and limit 
donations from ideological pacs to a total of 2000 per candidate 
for both primary and general elections 
while the new democratic proposal would ban all pac 
contributions to individual candidates it would still allow pacs 
to collectively contribute up to 5 million to the democratic and 
republican parties and up to 30 percent of the money raised by 
senate party campaign committees 
however democrats would outlaw socalled leadership pacs 
organized by senators and congressmen 
democrats also would raise from 25000 to 30000 the total of 
contributions an individual can make to several campaigns or 
political committees but the extra 5000 could go only to state 
party committees

an armycommissioned poll published thursday in 
the israel defense forces weekly indicated about 30 percent of 
israelis surveyed lacked full faith in army announcements and the 
ethical behavior of soldiers 
independent experts said this represented a significant erosion 
in public support for the army as a result of its handling of the 
palestinian uprising in which 681 palestinians and 43 israelis 
have died 
but army spokesman brig gen nachman shai said the poll showed 
a strong backing for the army 
im not satisfied with 70 percent support he said in 
an interview but after almost 29 months of intefadeh arabic for 
uprising it does speak for the basic support of the people for the 
military 
shai said he believed the credibility of army announcements had 
declined in the past two decades the result mainly of more 
aggressive and critical israeli news media 
he noted the army opened itself to more coverage and liberalized 
censorship 
people recognize it is part of democracy the price you have 
to pay he said 
the poll found 70 percent of those surveyed believed army 
statements were reliable 25 percent felt the army spokesmans 
office sometimes reliable four percent described communiques as 
unreliable no judgment was forthcoming from the remaining one 
percent 
the independent dahaf institute surveyed 1101 israeli adults 
for the poll in march ruth zin of dahaf said there was a 25 
percent margin of error 
about 70 percent of those polled also thought the army adhered 
to moral standards but it found 30 percent felt soldiers only 
conformed somewhat to ethical guidelines 
it found 95 percent believed they could rely on the armys 
combat ability 
ms zin said she could not determine whether the findings 
represented a significant change in israeli thinking since the 
questions had not been asked in previous surveys 
however independent military analysts and pollsters said the 
results pointed to a significant drop in support in a country where 
nearly everyone serves in the army and the military has 
traditionally been held in high esteem

the local democratic party thursday narrowly 
rejected a resolution drafted by the party chairman that would have 
requested mayor marion barry to abandon any plans to run for 
reelection in november 
the proposal was voted down by a 2923 margin after almost two 
hours of tumultous debate in which barry supporters repeatedly 
shouted insults at committee chairman josyln williams who drafted 
the resolution and others who supported it 
following the vote the mayors supporters left the district 
building hearing room shouting four more years 
barry faces trial next month on five misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges and three felony counts of lying to a federal 
grand jury about his drug use 
the unprecedented resolution declared barrys leadership in 
question and concluded with the request that he announce that 
he will not seek renomination in 1990 
barry has not publicly disclosed his future political plans 
however he has made numerous campaignstyle appearance since his 
return to the city from seven weeks of treatment for substance 
abuse and sources close to the mayor said barry intends to run for 
a fourth fouryear term despite his impending trial 
in a letter to williams barry called the resolution 
undemocratic because it undermines the right of the voter to 
decide 
barry also said the partys action would have little influence 
on my decision about my political future 
barry did not attend the meeting but his sentiments were echoed 
by many who did 
it is not this committees place to tell anyone who is trying 
to take part in the democratic process that they cant run said 
harry thomas jr president of the local young democrats chapter 
it hasnt been done before and if this party wants to get 
political then we should endorse somebody not discourage 
them 
others objected on procedural grounds saying they had not been 
given enough notice 
the 72member state democratic committee so named despite the 
district of columbias lack of statehood has staunchly backed 
barry in the past 
anita bonds barrys political manager said the mayor attempted 
to discourage williams and other members of the committee from 
drafting the resolution during a private meeting last week 
the mayor attempted to discourage them from doing this and 
told them that it would not be the only factor in his deciding his 
political plans bonds said today the mayors position 
remains the same 
five democrats already are vying for barrys job recent opinion 
polls show that the mayor still enjoys the support of between 20 
percent and 25 percent of the citys electorate there is no 
runoff provision under city election law which means the partys 
september primary could be won with a fairly small fraction of the 
vote 
former police chief maurice t turner the prohibitive favorite 
to win the republican nomination has run even with or ahead of 
barry in recent surveys 
democrats outnumber republicans in the district by almost a 
ninetoone margin 
meanwhile court papers released thursday showed that barry 
declined to answer invoking his constitutional right against 
selfincrimination when a grand jury asked him whether he had used 
drugs in the past five years 
during grand jury appearances on jan 19 and jan 24 1989 
barry testified that he had not exchanged drugs with convicted drug 
dealer charles lewis and that he was unaware of lewis involvement 
with narcotics 
but in a letter dated jan 25 1989 released by us attorney 
jay b stephens barry declined to answer the grand jurys question 
whether he had used within the past five years any illegal drug 
or substance including cocaine 
in the papers filed thursday stephens said barry consciously 
engaged in a course of conduct to corroborate the known lies of 
others that exonerated him and to remain silent about other 
matters 
barry is now accused of lying on three occasions to the panel 
once each about whether he and lewis gave each other cocaine and 
also when asked whether he was aware of lewis drug involvement 
the letter was released as stephens sought to block efforts by 
barrys attorney to have the perjury charges against the mayor 
dismissed 
a conviction on any of the perjury charges would bar him from 
holding office or seeking reelection 
neither barry nor his spokeswoman lurma rackley were 
immediately available to comment on the documents

president bush gets a lot of attention 
bashing colombian cocaine traffickers now colombian tv crews are 
touring this country to see whats being done to choke off the 
demand that drives the drug trade 
the south american film crew worked in connecticuts largest 
city thursday after stopping last weekend in washington dc to 
interview federal officials 
the visitors focused on the seemingly insatiable demand that has 
made traffickers rich powerful and feared in their country said 
maria eugenia sierra a journalist with the network news show 
telenoticiero del mediodia 
the united states has the problem of the consumption of drugs 
whereas there are tremendous consequences in colombia as a result 
of this problem the narcotraffickers she said 
the traffickers have been blamed for more than 200 deaths in 
colombia since august when colombian president virgilio barco 
declared a crackdown 
the colombian crew whose show is seen by about 3 million each 
weekday at noon came to bridgeport to talk with people who run 
antidrug programs and the kids they try to help 
at a conference at the bridgeport hilton they interviewed 
13yearold kisha rivera one of 200 student leaders in a drug 
prevention program 
she asked me what i have done to stay away from drugs 
rivera said i said no ive never tried it 
miss rivera doesnt just say no when offered drugs she told 
the interviewers she has taken the opportunity to try to persuade 
her drugusing peers to fight their problem 
i said no and tried to help them miss rivera said and if 
they dont want any help i dont have a friendly relationship with 
them but if they accept ill take them to the guidance 
counselor 
john higginsbiddle the director of the regional youth 
substance abuse program explained to the colombian crew that the 
program builds selfesteem so youngsters can turn down drugs and 
alcohol it also targets students at risk and helps them find 
counseling 
we realize there has been a reduction in the use of drugs and 
programs have had some effect sierra said our intention here 
is to come to know some of these programs and possibly use them in 
colombia 
in washington sierra interviewed drug czar william bennett he 
took the opportunity to praise barcos campaign against the cocaine 
traffickers and to say he hoped colombians wouldnt see us 
efforts to help barco as meddling 
sierra and the crew also stopped in princeton nj at the 
robert wood johnson foundation which gave 27 million in grants 
this year to fight drug and alcohol abuse 
and they interviewed thomas hendrick director of partnership 
for a drugfree america thats the campaign that features the 
bubbling egg in a frying pan and the words this is your brain on 
drugs 
sierra has higher hopes for her show than one from a competing 
network which has yet to air the program it taped in florida and 
detroit four months ago 
the news we hear from the embassy is they are so intimidated 
by the drug cartel that the chances of airing anything are nil 
said alan botto a director with the us information agency he 
set up the interviews for both crews 
you know every day you arrive at work and you do your job 
and there is a general and continuous danger sierra said 
but the truth of the matter is you just get used to it we 
must go as far as we can in this battle we must go as far as the 
narcotraffickers will allow us

a couple cannot claim their sexbased church 
of the most high goddess is a religion protected by constitutional 
freedoms and thus immune from attempts to enforce vice laws a 
federal judge ruled thursday 
wilbur tracy 51 and his wife mary ellen 47 argued that the 
church which promises salvation through sex in exchange for 
monetary sacrifices should be protected by the us constitution 
the couple testified the church was based on an ancient eqyptian 
religion in which intercourse with mrs tracy alias priestess 
sabrina aset cleansed the soul as a purification rite 
proof came in the form of cash or other tokens of sacrifice 
mrs tracy testified wednesday 
mrs tracy said she qualified as a high priestess for the 
religion in 1986 by sleeping with 1000 men over a twoyear period 
but us district judge w matthew byrne rejected the argument 
ruling after a fiveday nonjury trial that they werent protected 
from law enforcement prosecution by constitutional religious 
freedom guarantees 
the tracys filed the lawsuit claiming city officials pursuing 
prostitution charges violated her first amendment right to 
religious freedom named in the lawsuit were city attorney james 
hahn and police chief daryl gates 
assistant city attorney bryon r boeckman said authorities 
believe mrs tracy and her husband used the church as a front for 
prostitution 
this is not a true religion boeckman said 
advertised in sexually explicit magazines the church boasted 
services run by the priestess wearing a strapless redsequined 
gown highheeled shoes and fishnet stockings 
the sparsely furnished church had no pews or pulpit the few 
wall hangings in place included posters of movie stars and a framed 
nude photograph of mrs tracy 
the tracys filed the lawsuit while their misdemeanor criminal 
convictions for prostitution and running a brothel are on appeal 
they claim divine inspiration prompted them to revive an ancient 
egyptian religion in which man justifies his sins by having sex 
with church priestesses 
she said initiates needed to confess and have sex before they 
could be considered for sin negation and purification 
then sacrifices of cash or other valuables were required to 
show dedication to the church before having sexual intercourse 
the rituals would end if there were no sacrifices asked 
byrne 
correct mrs tracy answered there is no purpose to 
having your sins negated if you do not wish to emulate god 
she denied that she sought specific payment amounts during her 
criminal trial testimony included allegations she demanded minimum 
payments of 150 
its up to a person to decide if its an acceptable 
sacrifice she said 
she testified tuesday that she collected about 50000 in 
donations during a threeyear period but did not keep records 
regarding followers beyond their first names and telephone numbers 
she acknowledged that about 50 percent of the men paid only one 
visit and never returned 
i dont think thats very unusual for any religion she said

embattled president samuel doe on 
thursday appealed to rebels to lay down their arms and submit 
proposals for negotiations and his government said a delegation 
was traveling to washington for talks on the insurgency

negotiate with rebel leader charles taylor

delegation would meet with members of congress and state department 
officials the state department however had no comment on any 
talks that might be planned

power in a bloody april 12 1980 coup that ended the domination of 
a small elite of americos the descendants of the slaves

of civilians since rebels invaded eastern nimba county from ivory 
coast on dec 24 more than 150000 refugees have fled the fighting 
to neighboring countries or other parts of liberia 
on thursday national media continued to broadcast an appeal 
from doe to the rebels asking them to stop their offensive and 
present their grievances for negotiation

disputed reports that the rebels were in striking distance of 
monrovia 
however moses washington the acting liberian information 
minister said thursday that troops were continuing to battle 
rebels in grand bassa county 90 miles east of monrovia he said 
there also has been fighting in the rebel stronghold in central 
nimba 
a twopronged rebel advance toward monrovia and buchanan the 
countrys second port has dangerously stretched rebel supply 
lines the rebels initially met indifferent opposition from 
government troops many of them conscripted and poorly paid who 
often flee the fighting 
but much stiffer resistance can be expected nearer to monrovia

a military prosecutor on thursday night 
freed a local journalist whose overnight detention was criticized 
by president patricio aylwin 
a lawyer for the independent santiago daily newspaper la epoca 
luis sandoval said release of journalist manuel salazar was 
ordered by army maj raul rozas the same man who ordered his 
detention a day earlier 
salazar had uncovered the identity of a former secret police 
agent linked to the 1976 assassination in washington of former 
foreign minister orlando letelier and an american associate ronni 
moffitt 
rozas on wednesday also freed the former police agent 
the letelier case is proving to be a delicate issue for the 
elected civilian president who has pledged full cooperation 
with us officials on it and investigations into alleged human 
rights abuses during the 16year military dictatorship 
later thursday aylwin met with gen augusto pinochet for the 
first time since the rightwing army commander gave up the 
presidency in march but neither man disclosed what was discussed 
it was widely expected to include rights issues 
upon pinochets arrival at the presidential palace a small 
group of demonstrators booed him and shouted murderer two 
people were detained police said 
pinochet left the 40minute meeting through an underground exit 
avoiding reporters 
letelier was a bitter foe of pinochet three former officials in 
pinochets secret police were indicted in us courts and one of 
them admitted his role in the sept 21 1976 car bombing and served 
a sevenmonth us prison sentence 
aylwin told reporters he was surprised by the prosecutors 
order 
i think judges have the obligation to explain the reasons for 
the decisions they make he said outside his santiago residence 
the prosecutor questioned salazar for 10 hours wednesday and 
ordered he be held incommunicado indefinitely 
at the same time rozas freed the former secret agent monica 
luisa lagos 38 she had spent five days in jail while undergoing 
questioning about an alleged accessory role in the assassination of 
letelier 
questioned by reporters rozas declined to explain why he 
ordered salazars arrest he cited the secret nature of his 
investigation 
under chilean law military prosecutors can order people 
arrested during their investigations 
aylwin however said an explanation would not affect the 
secrecy of the investigation he said the action requires 
clarification from the proper authority 
salazar is national editor of la epoca and led the newspapers 
efforts to uncover the womans identity in a frontpage editorial 
under the headline our protest la epoca on thursday criticized 
the prosecutors decision as an attack on press freedom 
the woman admitted she is a former agent of a nowdefunct secret 
police agency known as dina she said she traveled to the united 
states under the assumed name of liliana walker providing cover 
for another agent who was an accomplice in the letelier slaying 
letelier was a prominent foe of pinochet who led a 1973 
military coup that overthrew the elected leftist government of 
president salvador allende 
the other two officers wanted in the letelier case are still in 
chile and us authorities say they will continue their efforts to 
bring them to justice 
on wednesday night the chilean senate unanimously approved a 
bill to posthumously restore letelier his chilean citizenship 
which the pinochet government removed 10 days before his death

the pentagons plans to deploy nuclear 
missiles on railroad cars is in big big trouble in congress 
because of a reported proposal by the air force to eliminate funds 
for the system a senator said thursday 
air force officials refused to confirm reports that the service 
had recommended that defense secretary dick cheney cut funds to 
move the multiplewarhead mx missile from fixed silos to railroad 
cars 
the air force supports the presidents budget thats on the 
hill for the twomissile program franklin c miller deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for nuclear forces and arms control 
policy told a senate armed services subcommittee 
but sen james exon dneb chairman of the subcommittee on 
strategic forces and nuclear deterrence said the committee is 
aware of what the air force recommended and that proposal is 
undermining support for the system on capitol hill 
the mx railgarrison proposition is in big big trouble here 
since we know what the air force recommended and whether or not the 
secretary overrides that its going to have a bearing on what we 
do here the senator said 
in another senate hearing lt gen george l monahan jr 
director of the strategic defense initiative organization said 
said a cut of 1 billion from the sum proposed by president bush 
for star wars would clearly put our deployments further out 
in the future 
sen arlen specter rpa raised the possibility of such a cut 
to 36 billion in the new budget during discussion in the senate 
appropriations defense subcommittee current spending is 38 
billion and armed services commitee chairman sen sam nunn dga 
has urged that figure for the new budget 
president bushs 303 billion defense budget proposal for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 calls for 28 billion for the mx 
missile project and 202 million for development of the 
singlewarhead midgetman missile which could move about overland 
on special trucks 
members of congress however have questioned the pentagons 
plans to upgrade its strategic force in light of the reduced threat 
from the soviet bloc 
how can we make decisions on strategic modernization without 
knowing what the targets are said nunn 
miller said the pentagon is conducting a special review of those 
targets but was unable to say when it would be completed 
but the apparent air force plan on the mx missile caused 
consternation among the subcommittee members 
we are pawing around in the dark exon told the witnesses

luciano pavarotti took the stage at the bolshoi 
theater on thursday before an elite crowd including president 
mikhail s gorbachev who attended a concert to raise money for 
victims of the armenian earthquake 
pavarotti grinning broadly and extending his arms to the 
audience sang four encores to increasingly loud cries of 
bravo and insistent applause 
the italian star dedicated one of the encores to raisa 
gorbachev seated in a box just left of the stage he met briefly 
with the president and his wife backstage after the soldout 
performance 
the gorbachevs joined in warmly applauding pavarotti on his 
first trip to the soviet union in 15 years it was the tenors 
first performance at the famed bolshoi 
theater workers said people hoping to buy the few available 
tickets began lining up at 2 am 10 hours before the box office 
opened the theater was surrounded by police 
asked why he was trying to buy a spare ticket across the street 
from the 2500seat theater engineer sasha zlorovsky said 
pavarotti is singing that says it all 
irina sukhotsky an economist couldnt get through the police 
cordon to find an acquaintance she said would have a ticket for 
her olya pivovarova a student managed to slip through but had 
little luck getting a ticket the problem was not the price but 
the availability 
pavarotti thrilled the crowd inside the redandgold trimmed 
theater with a selection of songs from bellini rossini verdi and 
others he was accompanied at the piano by leone magiera 
among the toughest critics in the hall was usher yekaterina 
vitova an opera lover who has seen stars come and go during her 30 
years at moscows most famous theater 
he has a brilliant voice she said she praised not only the 
power of his voice but his control of it and compared him to 
soviet tenor sergei lemeshev a bolshoi star in the 1950s and 1960s 
in my mind hes better than anyone we have here she said 
she also was a little concerned about pavarottis girth hes 
hefty isnt he she asked i guess they have to be in order to 
sing like that 
among those who attended the concert were such soviet luminaries 
as poet yevgeny yevtushenko magazine editor vitaly korotich 
lawyer and newspaper editor fyodor burlatsky and gorbachev adviser 
georgy shakhnazarov

to build a 30 million hospital in spitak in armenia the city was 
destroyed by an earthquake in december 1988 that killed 25000 
people in northern armenia

the costa rican government and 
foreign creditor banks have agreed on a formula to lower the 
central american nations 45 billion foreign debt an official 
said thursday 
eduardo lizano president of the central bank told a news 
conference that costa rica will repurchase 64 percent of its 18 
billion commercial foreign debt at 16 cents on the dollar 
the deal to be signed saturday will save costa rica 110 
million a year in debt principal and service payments he said the 
agreement was to be signed by treasury secretary rodrigo bolanos 
and representatives of the foreign banks 
once the agreement is signed costa rica will have until may 21 
to pay 253 million to bring itself up to date in payments and 
repurchase the old debt lizano said 
government officials said that costa rica has fallen behind on 
debt payments of 145 million a year however under the new 
agreement it will owe only 35 million annually 
costa rica was one of the earliest countries to reach agreement 
in principle on new financing packages under a us plan unveiled 
in march 1989 by treasury secretary nicholas brady

their loans to third world nations or reduce the interest charged 
in return for guarantees that the remaining debt will be paid

the united states could lose its leadership in 
superconductivity research because us companies are investing 
less in the technology than their overseas competitors according 
to a congressional study released thursday 
the office of technology assessment used hightemperature 
superconductivity as a test of the nations ability to sustain a 
longterm research and development effort said study director 
gregory eyring 
we have had a large government investment eyring said 
but if you look at the industry side the situation isnt as 
encouraging 
the primary interest is whether were ahead of the japanese 
he said 
physicist paul chu of the university of houston a pioneer in 
the field said he agreed to a certain extent with the studys 
conclusions 
us industrys involvement is certainly not as great as that 
in japan chu said wed like to see more 
the commitment from government could be even more longterm 
chu said while quantity of that commitment is important the 
quality is even more important without stability and continuity 
we cannot plan our program efficiently 
the us government spent 130 million on superconductivity 
research in 1989 while japan spent less than 70 million the study 
said but japanese companies in late 1988 and early 1989 invested 
about 107 million in such research compared with about 73 million 
by us firms it said 
superconductors have no resistance to the flow of electricity 
if they could be harnessed in ordinary electrical devices they 
could avoid the energy lost to heating in the generation and 
distribution of power 
so far the principal uses of superconductors are in magnets in 
medical imaging devices and particle accelerators 
superconductivity was discovered in 1911 but for years 
superconductors were only known to work when cooled by liquid 
helium to a few degrees above absolute zero minus 459 degrees 
fahrenheit 
in 1986 chu discovered a superconductor that worked at minus 
234 degrees fahrenheit a temperature reached with cheap liquid 
nitrogen and higher temperatures have been reported since 
the ota study said hightemperature superconductivity should 
receive a higher priority at universities than it does now

president lyndon johnson was an awesome engine 
of a man whose personality and deeds cannot be captured in a 
book a former aide said thursday at a 25th anniversary symposium 
celebrating lbjs 1965 inaugural 
lady bird johnson and daughters luci turpin of toronto and lynda 
robb of mclean va were among several hundred people who attended 
the symposium of friends and former associates 
jack valenti special assistant to johnson in 196366 said 
nobody knows better than the people in this room that lyndon 
johnson was manysided contradictory and no one near him with 
the exception of his wife ever took the total measure of the man 
and so it will be that none of the written or yet to be 
written volumes will be definitive on the work president johnson 
performed on the deeds that he accomplished and on the flaws he 
exhibited 
valenti referred to the controversy raging over the second 
volume of a threevolume biography of johnson the author robert 
caro portrays the former president as a man without scruples who 
stole his 1948 election to the us senate 
valenti now president of the motion picture association of 
america said caros latest book means of ascent and the 
earlier volume fall short way short 
every caro word is dipped in curare every caro page squirmed 
with loathing the cards are marked the deck is stacked he said 
almost anything that you could say about lbj had a tinge of 
truth except one thing you could never say he was dull valenti 
said he was an awesome engine of a man and you and i in this 
room will never ever again see his like 
former democratic vice presidential candidate sargent shriver a 
johnson assistant in 196568 said the united states needs 
desperately the vision of a kennedy and the political genius of a 
johnson and their cando spirit to get our nation moving again 
yes ive read and heard about kennedys alleged womanizing 
and johnsons alleged theft of an election shriver said in a 
reference to caros version of johnsons narrow 1948 us senate 
victory over former texas gov coke stevenson who was lionized in 
the book as a texas hero 
the only perfect man ive ever heard of is jesus christ and 
the only perfect woman was his mother mary shriver said so 
im not looking for any miraculous reincarnation of virgin birth 
most certainly im not looking for a coke stevenson 
the symposium cosponsored by the university of texas at austin 
and lbj library continues through saturday 
johnson who became president after the nov 22 1963 
assassination of john f kennedy won the white house on his own in 
1964 he retired to his ranch west of austin in 1969 and lived 
there until his death in 1973

prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
party lost heavily in local elections thursday and socialists 
posted their best performance since she won power 11 years ago 
but the conservatives in deep trouble over the economy and the 
imposition of an unpopular new local government tax averted the 
rout forecast in opinion polls where mrs thatcher trails by 
nearly 20 points 
not a marvellous result but certainly not the disaster that 
was being predicted said environment secretary chris patten the 
cabinet official in charge of the new socalled poll tax its 
the massacre that didnt happen 
the labor party was jubilant it was the only party to make net 
gains and easily outstripped its target of 200 new seats 
with results declared from 180 of the 201 councils labor had 
made 10 new gains to control 89 concils the conservatives lost 
eight and had control of 36 
the thirdrunning centrist social and liberal democratic party 
controlled three councils and had lost three no party had overall 
control in the rest 
about 5000 seats were at stake 
were delighted said labor campaign manager bryan gould 
but he said the tories not doing as badly as predicted would 
lessen pressure by some worried conservatives to try to shed mrs 
thatcher as leader if so the tories will be making a mistake 
he added 
for the first time since mrs thatcher won power in 1979 
laborites made significant gains in the tory heartlands of the 
prosperous south 
labor seized control from the tories of the south england port 
of portsmouth and for the first time in nearly 20 years laborites 
won seats in nearby torbay previously total conservative territory 
the tories also lost control of the key northern industrial city 
of bradford 
but in london labor fared badly in what some analysts saw as a 
continuing legacy of ultraleft labor councils that captured control 
of some of the 36 boroughs in the 1980s 
in a key result the conservatives held with a hugely increased 
majority londons wandsworth borough a focus of national attention 
after setting the lowest poll tax in the nation the tax helps fund 
local council spending 
a bbc computer prediction early friday indicated a swing of 12 
percent against the government 
this is something we can learn from but theres no reason to 
panic said conservative legislator john biffen the partys 
former leader in the house of commons 
bbc analyst peter kellner said the tory performance was the 
worst since modern politics began the tories really are in deep 
trouble 
the elections were the first comprehensive opinion test since 
mrs thatcher won a third successive term in 1987 
in polls taken in the past month the labor lead averaged a huge 
19 points but down from an average 23 points in the previous month 
according to forecasts from two weekend opinion polls the 
socialists were poised to snatch up to 300 seats from the tories 
or onefourth of the total defended by the governing party 
mrs thatcher hoped the poll tax imposed april 1 would turn 
voters against highspending laborcontrolled authorities 
instead most families are paying more and blame the government 
the tax is also seen as unfair because everyone in a district pays 
the same irrespective of income 
under the old system of property taxes only the 17 million 
homeowners paid now all 38 million adult britons have to pay with 
rebates for the 95 million poorest 
the seats at stake thursday were on regional authorities from 
remote islands off northern scotland to big cities and english 
rural districts 
the authorities run services ranging from education and 
subsidized housing to street cleaning and garbage removal they are 
funded through a combination of the poll tax business taxes and 
central government grants 
before voting labor held about 2500 of the seats the tories 
1500 and centrists or independents the rest 
before thursday labor ran 97 of the councils the conservatives 
60 and the centrist social and liberal democratic party 18 in the 
others no party had overall control

a passenger train crashed into a truck 
injuring 30 people thursday less than 24 hours after another 
amtrak train smashed into a row of freight cars in indiana in an 
accident that injured 26 
the latest accident occurred about 930 am when the train 
city of new orleans en route from chicago to new orleans 
struck a log truck at a private railroad crossing near the memphis 
hardwood co a lumberyard in durant 
authorities said no flashing lights or signs marked the crossing 
it looked like a dynamite explosion said state trooper 
jimmie d thomas who witnessed the accident when it hit it 
scattered lumber all over creation and the truck was dragged down 
the track 
it was a big jolt said passenger melissa mitchell 
everybody woke up we got outside and saw that we were 
majorly off the track but upright 
deborah hare an amtrak spokeswoman said there were 200 
passengers and 13 crew members aboard the train four crew members 
were among those injured she said officials earlier said there 
were from 160 to 170 people including crew on the train 
it was the second amtrak crash in two days and the third in two 
weeks 
authorities said an incorrectly set switch sent a 
chicagotoindianapolis train crashing into freight cars wednesday 
night near crawfordsville ind on april 22 at least 91 people 
were reported hurt three seriously when the national passenger 
rail lines california zephyr derailed in iowa en route from 
california to chicago 
the southbound hoosier state with 30 to 35 people aboard 
derailed wednesday night after striking five freight cars parked on 
an outside track 40 miles northwest of indianapolis 
a passenger and the trains engineer and assistant engineer 
remained hospitalized thursday with minor injuries the others were 
treated 
thank god we were only going 25 mph or him and i would be 
history said assistant engineer james neff 42 referring to 
himself and amtrak employee james ullery 40 
ullery said that by the time he noticed the train was on the 
wrong track it was too late 
officials from amtrak conrail the national transportation

investigating the cause of the crash but released no preliminary 
results conrail owns the track where the accident occurred

memphis hardwood was transferred by helicopter to mississippi 
baptist medical center in jackson 45 miles south of durant he was 
in stable condition 
i was sound asleep when the train hit and it was a rather 
rude and abrupt alarm clock i thought mitchell said 
boren was trapped more than one hours after the accident the 
log truck had left a nearby lumberyard shortly before the crash 
occurred 
amtrak officials said the remaining passengers were loaded on 
school buses and driven to jackson where they would catch chartered

the contras insisted thursday that the 
sandinista army must be dismantled at the same time as the rebels 
a demand the chamorro government immediately rejected as dangerous 
to nicaraguas fragile peace 
aristides sanchez a spokesman for the ussupported contras 
said the rebels will not meet the june 10 deadline to hand in their 
weapons to un military peacekeepers as they had pledged to do in 
an april 19 agreement 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said earlier 
thursday he considered the holdup in demobilization a matter of 
grave concern 
sanchez a civilian adviser to the contra leaders said thursday 
that what the contras now want is the complete dismantling of 
the army simultaneously with the rebel force 
that is what the people of nicaragua ask for that is what the 
people want and we should support that he said 
one doesnt have to be so airtight about it sanchez replied 
when asked if the rebels planned to meet the june 10 deadline 
he spoke to reporters shortly after arriving in managua from a 
rebel hideout in hill country with contra military chief israel 
galeano and four members of galeanos general staff to discuss the 
problem friday with officials of president violeta barrios de 
chamorros government 
after 10 years of fighting its not possible to dismantle 
an organization in 24 hours galeano replied when asked why his 
fighters have not started to demobilize 
roberto ferrey a government spokesman and himself a former 
contra was asked if the government would consider acceding to the 
rebel demand 
in principle no he replied june 10 is the deadline its 
not possible to change it 
leaders of the sandinista party which mrs chamorro easily 
defeated in elections feb 25 say nicaragua could be plunged into 
chaos if the contras do not disband on schedule they add however 
that the army is protected by the constitution from any drastic 
shakeups 
mrs chamorro took office april 25 for a sixyear term she 
promised to respect the militarys professional structure but plans 
to cut deeply the size of the army to reduce government spending 
and mend the warshattered economy 
the contra leaders arrived dressed in fatigues but unarmed 
accompanied by observers from the un and the organization of 
american states 
perez de cuellar said he considered it a matter of grave 
concern that the demobilization of the members of the nicaraguan 
resistance did not begin in the afternoon of april 25 as 
stipulated in the agreements signed at managua on april 1819 
the security council which called for un observers to disarm 
the contras will meet friday to discuss the demobilization problem 
serious efforts must now be made by all concerned in order to 
get the demobilization process quickly back on track perez de 
cuellar said in his report this can only be done if the solemn 
commitments contained in the managua agreements are scrupulously 
honored 
on his recommendation 586 military observers from a venezuelan 
battalion and 54 un military observers were deployed in five 
security zones in nicaragua 
ferrey who represents mrs chamorro in the peace talks with the 
rebels said her meeting with the contra people friday is to 
discuss security issues and guarantees for their demobilization and 
disarmament according to the accords 
rebel negotiator oscar sovalbarro signed the accord on 
disarmament and demobilization but galeano had said earlier he 
would not disband his troops because mrs chamorro kept a 
sandinista as army chief 
mrs chamorro has retained gen humberto ortega who was defense 
minister in the sandinista government as army chief of staff but 
says the assignment is temporary 
maj jose luis garcia head of intelligence for the un peace 
keeping forces in nicaragua said that as of last week more than 
6000 rebels have gathered in the five security zones though they 
are still armed

federal prosecutors said thursday that manuel 
noriegas lead attorney told them he had received a 
sevenfigure retainer but defense lawyers said the statement 
was made in jest and the team has no money left 
the issue was raised in response to the defense teams motion to 
withdraw from the case on grounds the government had frozen all 
noriegas bank accounts leaving them with no financial resources 
that motion was scheduled to go before us district judge 
william hoeveler late friday afternoon 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan said in papers filed 
thursday opposing the withdrawal that the defense teams claims 
are simply untrue and disingenuous 
according to an affidavit on or about january 1990 lead 
noriega attorney frank rubino discussed his retainer with another 
assistant us attorney cynthia hawkins during the course of a 
plea bargain conference on an unrelated case 
as it was being typed up mr rubino mentioned that the 
retainer he had been paid to represent gen noriega was in seven 
figures or at least 1 million according to ms hawkins 
signed statement 
rubino then asked whether i was going to go into private 
practice to make more money the affidavit said 
rubino said thursday he recalled the incident which he said 
occurred well after the united states began its invasion of panama 
on dec 20 but before noriega arrived in the united states in early 
january 
i was in her office we were all laughing and talking and 
joking he said in a telephone interview from her lips to 
gods ears it should be true he said jokingly its just 
silly 
cocounsel jon may said the government had taken seriously a 
statement that was made in jest there is no money he added 
that the defense would give more details at fridays hearing 
may also said the defense would demand that the government show 
probable cause for contending the frozen funds were drugrelated 
should prosecutors fail to do that the defense would demand the 
money be turned over to noriega he said 
the governments response stated it has frozen 20 million in 
various bank accounts but only one is in noriegas name and 
investigators do not know if that account contains any money 
stripped of its misleading and unsupported allegations 
counsels argument represents an attempt to require the government 
to pay defense counsel a higher fee said the us attorneys 
response which was also signed by prosecutors myles malman and guy 
lewis 
the defense motion filed monday said the attorneys had run out 
of money and could not hire attorneys secretaries and 
investigators to handle the complex case they said they had 
received no fees for 10 months and only a few thousand dollars in 
expense money 
noriega was indicted here in february 1988 on charges of taking 
money from colombias medellin drug cartel to make panama into a 
safe haven for cocaine smuggling noriega surrendered to us 
authorities on jan 4 two weeks after us troops invaded panama 
and is being held at the metropolitan correctional center outside 
miami

the united states and mexico on thursday 
pledged cooperation in the war on drugs despite an undercurrent of 
tension stemming from the abduction of a mexican citizen wanted by 
us officials 
us attorney general dick thornburgh and his mexican 
counterpart delivered separate speeches at a conference of 
attorneys general from states on both sides of the border 
thornburgh praised mexicos priority efforts against drugs and 
corruption and said cooperation between the two nations has never 
been better 
he also referred to the problems that inevitably arise among 
neighbors 
the kidnapping of a guadalajara gynecologist wanted in 
connection with the murder of a us drug agent has strained 
relations between the united states and mexico it was the subject 
of closeddoor talks wednesday between thornburgh and mexican 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo 
mexican officials said thursday they want proof of us claims 
that the kidnapping last month of dr humberto alvarez machain was 
masterminded by mexican federal police 
thornburgh told alvarez del castillo that mexican police had 
hatched the plot according to a source but a spokesman for 
alvarez del castillo said us officials did not back up the 
allegation 
if the department of justice of the united states has proof 
that demonstrates that the police in mexico intervened in the 
abduction of alvarez machain they should prove it said rene 
hernandez director of information for the mexican attorney 
generals office 
machain was abducted april 2 from his office and flown by 
private jet to el paso texas where he was arrested by the us 
drug enforcement administration 
he is to stand trial in los angeles for his alleged 
participation in the 1985 torture death of dea agent enrique 
camarena a federal judge has ordered a hearing may 25 into the 
circumstances of alvarezs arrival in the us 
a mexican who identified himself as a longtime dea operative 
told the los angeles times last week that he hatched the plot to 
kidnap alvarez and that it had dea approval dea has denied its 
involvement 
neither thornburgh nor alvarez del castillo mentioned the 
machain case specifically in their speeches thursday 
alvarez del castillo said the meeting of law enforcement 
officials was testimony of trust of respect of hope thats 
what mexico is offering 
let us recognize that on some occasions the fight against drug 
trafficking and drug addiction have generated disagreements 
alvarez del castillo said it often happens that common enemies 
generate confrontations that in the long run will be beneficial 
he also however made repeated references during his speech to 
mexicos sovereignty which mexico has complained was violated in 
the machain abduction 
mexican officials said they are prepared to ask for the 
extradition of the selfdescribed dea operative antonio garate 
bustamante

three white former lawmen were found guilty 
thursday of murder in the death of a black jail inmate in 1987 
the allwhite jury deliberated for about four hours before 
finding former hemphill police chief thomas ladner and former 
sabine county sheriffs deputies billy ray horton and james m 
hyden guilty in the death of loyal garner jr 
the 34yearold florien la resident died of head injuries two 
days after being arrested on christmas day 1987 on drunken driving 
charges 
an estimated 200 people packed the courtroom for thursdays 
verdict 
i want no show of emotion no outbursts no crying no 
nothing state district judge joe tunnells said before reading 
the jurys verdict 
garners widow corrinne garner cried quietly as the verdict 
was announced 
his mother sarah garner said im glad i hope its over 
they told us there would never be another trial but still i 
didnt given up there wasnt a day come that i didnt look up to 
heaven and talk to god about it she said 
johnnie maxie one of the two brothers arrested with garner 
said he was surprised by the outcome he said he had not expected 
the men to be convicted 
the three lawmen had been acquitted by a sabine county jury in 
july 1988 of charges that they violated garners civil rights by 
beating him and denying him medical attention 
the acquittal drew angry protests from the black community in 
east texas in november 1988 the two deputies filed a 6 million 
lawsuit claiming two trial witnesses and two lawyers concocted the 
case against them 
the three could be sentenced to a maximum 99 years in prison 
friday morning when the punishment phase of the trial is scheduled 
ladner and horton declined to comment after the verdict hyden 
asked if he had anything to say remarked tersely not yet 
during his closing arguments wednesday smith county district 
attorney jack skeen told the jury that the exlawmen displayed a 
total indifference to human life and that the badges they wore did 
not give them a license to murder 
john seale ladners lawyer called the prosecutions case weak 
because it was based on the dishonest testimony of three jailbird 
witnesses 
in his rebuttal skeen said prosecutors relied on testimony from 
inmates because the prisoners were the only witnesses who didnt 
work for the county 
a prosecutor told the jurors wednesday that the officers 
crossed over that line of law enforcement officers to common 
criminals when they beat garner 
defense attorneys said the men struck garner in selfdefense

a jury was selected thursday for raymond 
buckeys second trial in the mcmartin preschool child molestation 
case the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in us history 
the seating of 12 regular jurors and six alternates came less 
than a month after attorneys began their inquiry to find panelists 
unbiased by publicity surrounding the first buckey trial opening 
statements were set for monday 
buckey 31 who has been a defendant for nearly seven years was 
acquitted of 40 molestation charges jan 18 and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey was acquitted of 12 charges but prosecutors 
decided to retry buckey on eight counts on which the jury 
deadlocked 
a total of 13 charges were unresolved by that jury but the 
prosecution dropped five of those counts 
the first trial lasted nearly three years and cost 13 million 
the eight remaining charges being tried involve three children 
who attended the now defunct mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach 
a dramatically diminished group compared to the hundreds once 
described as alleged victims 
buckey and his lawyers who had hoped for dismissal of all 
remaining charges have accused district attorney ira reiner of 
playing politics with the case they say he decided to retry buckey 
to further his own ambitions to become california attorney general 
reiner has denied any ulterior motives 
parents of mcmartin school children campaigned loudly to have 
buckey retried in the week after his acquittal on most charges 
they conducted a letterwriting campaign went on national tv talk 
shows and held press conferences to espouse their views 
deputy district attorneys joe martinez and pam ferrero have said 
they hope the new trial can be concluded in six months but 
superior court judge stanley weisberg warned prospective jurors at 
the outset that the trial could continue into 1991

the interior department is pressing ahead with 
a trade of coalrich wyoming land for a pristine view in grand 
teton national park despite criticism that the taxpayers will get 
cheated on the deal 
rep mike synar dokla chairman of a house government 
operations subcommittee investigating the swap said the government 
is giving away too much coal at the fire sale price of 27 
cents a ton 
in exchange the government would receive a ban on development 
of the largest tract of private land in the wyoming national park 
both the rights to the coal and the park land were valued at 56 
million 
synars environment subcommittee which was reviewing the 
exchange at a hearing today released documents concluding that 
taxpayers could lose up to 180 million in the transaction because 
the coal was undervalued

more than 10000 beijing teenagers are giving up 
their saturday afternoons not really through choice to learn 
about the communist party in political study groups at high schools 
and universities 
official media hail the grups as proof of revived interest in 
ideology among youngsters 
in fact many of the students are volunteered by their 
schools or youth organizations others sign up because showing the 
right political attitudes can be a shortcut to a leading university 
or a good job 
classes have different names sparetime communist party 
school marxismleninism study group communism study group but 
share the goal of teaching students to love the party and fight 
bourgeois liberalism or western ideas 
chinese authorities are trying to recapture a generation that 
has harbored deep resentment of the party since the harsh military 
suppression of the democracy movement a year ago 
young people speak scornfully of the government in private but 
go along with the ideological campaign in order to avoid trouble 
this is the official story young chinese were shaken by last 
years movement which started among college students in beijing 
and spread quickly to other cities politically immature students 
did not fully understand communism or chinas national conditions 
and became pawns of foreign hostile forces 
a beijing high school student chosen from thousands of 
applicants for a 14week course on the communist party was quoted 
as saying we understand very little about the party i think 
this is closely related to why we had the turmoil last year 
according to the weekly beijing review one college student said 
he knew many of the arguments were wrong during the 
prodemocracy movement felt it difficult to produce a correct 
explanation and that only by studying marxismleninism could he 
distinguish right from wrong 
at fudan university in shanghai one of the most noted liberal 
arts schools philosophy major wang haifeng and seven classmates 
started a marxist philosophy study group in september official 
reports say 57 more groups have been started at fudan since 
involving more than 600 students 
on its front page last month china youth news published an 
appeal from wang and his seven friends that said we students 
have great need to study marxist philosophy to enhance our 
political quality and theoretical level studying marxism will help 
us establish a correct world view and outlook on life 
last fall more than 2000 students were said to be studying in 
the communist party school at qinghua university in beijing 
chinas foremost technical institution 
xinhua the official news agency said the students were so 
enthusiastic the university library could not meet the demand for 
such works as marxs communist manifesto and the selected 
works of mao tsetung 
the communist youth league in beijing has started similar 
classes for high school students at beijings no 4 middle school 
more than 800 students fill the auditorium each saturday afternoon 
for lectures by college professors and officials of the youth 
league committee 
zhou shiliang a professor at the youths college of political 
science run by the communist youth league lectured for two hours 
recently on the meaning and history of communism 
each weeks lectures are taped and shown to nearly 10000 high 
school students at other party schools in beijing 
four students from each beijing high school attended on the day 
zhou spoke most listened attentively but a few boys in warmup 
suits tapped their feet impatiently when an enticing spring breeze 
entered through the open auditorium doors one girl was seen 
reading a tattered novel hidden by her notebook 
zhou urged students to give up selfish ambitions and devote 
their lives to realizing communism in china he likened the task to 
climbing a mountain and declared if you want to be part of the 
work of communism you must be prepared spiritually and mentally 
at one point in his exhortation zhou roared at the students 
are you for protecting private ownership and exploitation or for 
wiping out private ownership and wiping out exploitation 
almost inaudibly his listeners muttered the correct response 
xu fei a 17yearold who took copious notes said afterward 
were all here to learn even though we live in a socialist 
country what is socialism really we dont know 
before i felt that communism was very distant and vague now 
i know that communism will indeed be achieved

there are socialists in japanese politics today who 
dont believe in socialism they believe in their own causes and 
in getting elected 
to do that they are joining the socalist party and changing it 
from a radical heavily ideological party unlikely to win power 
into a varied group of reformers with a far better chance against 
the governing liberal democrats 
the new members are lawyers physicians college professors 
journalists and housewives 
an example is tomiko okazaki a former television broadcaster 
who is one of 59 rookie socialist party members elected to the 
lower house of parliament in february the party increased its 
strength in the 512seat chamber where the power lies from 83 to 
139 
i was never a socialist and i have no ideological background 
at all said ms okazaki 46 i joined the party to get elected 
and to become a politician who can protect womens interests 
takako doi popular leader of the nations largest opposition 
party told the national convention in early april we need to 
promote a broad range of reforms now to make our party credible for 
taking over the government if we fail to do so now we may end 
up permanently in the opposition camp 
for years internal ideological disputes hampered socialist 
efforts to break the hold on power by the conservative 
probusiness liberal democrats who have governed japan since the 
party was formed in 1955 
since ms doi became the first woman leader of a major japanese 
party in 1986 the socialists have gradually muted intramural 
disagreements and shifted from ideology to a more populist style 
in july 1989 the socialists nearly doubled their strength in 
the 252seat upper house from 39 to 73 and the liberal democrats 
lost their majority for the first time 
the governing party retained control in the february elections 
for the lower house by winning 275 seats but the strong socialist 
gains demonstrated that the opposition party is a growing challenge 
analysts said the socialists benefited from ms dois popularity 
and a dual liberal democratic handicap an influencebuying scandal 
that reached the top levels of the establishment and an unpopular 
sales tax 
tadatoshi akiba a former geometry professor at tufts university 
in the united states said ms doi asked him last year to join the 
party and run for parliament 
i never thought about becoming a politician nor was i ever 
interested in socialism before the 47yearold legislator said 
i decided to run for parliament because i thought i can change 
the socialist party and japans politics from inside 
asked what changes he wants in the party he said it was 
changing already because it endorsed nonsocialists like me in 
the election 
at its convention in april the party took the call for a 
socialist revolution out of its constitution some opposition was 
expressed by leftist factions but a comfortable majority supported 
eliminating the clause 
our key right now is to take control of the government 
tsuruo yamaguchi the party secretarygeneral said in an 
interview i think most party members are willing to sacrifice 
their stubborn ideological positions for the sake of gaining 
control of the government 
party leaders say even giving it a new name is possible 
sukio iwatare a policy coordinator said some of the changes 
were spurred by the collapse of communism in eastern europe 
if the term revolution or the name socialists projects the 
wrong image that our party is a bunch of revolutionaries i dont 
see why we should not change them he said 
vice chairman makoto tanabe said the party would continue a 
market economy with no drastic changes but impose certain 
restrictions on economic activities from the viewpoint of 
protecting our environment and avoiding unfairness in our society 
under the liberal democrats he said only certain groups 
such as large companies and landowners have thrived while most 
people were not awarded the benefits of japans economic success 
foreign policy has been a problem for the socialist party 
because it advocated disarmament and neutrality for japan and 
abolition of the japanus security treaty 
the new line continues support for unarmed neutrality iwatare 
said but we would not take a drastic approach to our ideal

its not widely known but fred dryer played a 
hardboiled sports reporter before he became the hardeyed 
constable of nbcs hunter the occasion a superbowl press 
conference in january 1975 
he and lance rentzel wore battered fedoras with hatbrim cards 
that said press they technically were employed by the los angeles 
rams then but they had press credentials secured by dick schaap 
then a magazine sports editor 
in their nonrams capacity as newshawks dryer recalls they 
asked such probing questions as they say this is the big game 
and theres no tomorrow will you in fact be disappointed when the 
sun comes up tomorrow 
for some reason this caused grumbling from scribes who took pro 
football as almost seriously as tv does most however realized a 
puton was under way not so some national football league 
functionaries 
they went crazy dryer said with slight grin in due course 
he said thennfl commissioner pete rozelle made inquiries he 
said i understand you guys are reporters what are you doing 
i said well were here to cover the news and print the 
unmentioned theres a lot of smut that needs to be punched up and 
were just the two guys to do it 
the light dawned rozelle realized it was a spoof the 
superbowl in which the rams werent playing came and went 
six years later so did dryer at least from pro ball after 13 
seasons as a defensive tackle for the rams and new york giants 
although he knew that party had to end sometime he hadnt 
particularly thought what hed do after football until 1978 he 
said 
then after considering and rejecting life in real estate he 
began considering the acting business then studied it for five 
years with actress nina foch 
i had to find out what it was how interested i was in it and 
most important could i make a living at it he says 
small roles here and there followed including four cheers 
episodes as ted dansons old pal from baseball days then he read 
for hunter which some critics would later sneer at as a 
smallscreen edition of dirty harry 
similar sneers greeted his first venture into feature films a 
modern marine shootemup called death before dishonor two 
years ago it proved dead on arrival at the box office for which 
dryer blames the producers 
but hunter has lasted six seasons with dryer as its lean 
bluejeaned star nbc has found it a durable saturday series 
the network which in midapril shifted hunter to mondays 
says a seventh season is likely if so dryer who says it already 
has been renewed will start anew with a new female partner 
stepfanie kramer is giving up her role as hunters sidekick 
sgt dee dee mccall for films and singing her swan song so to 
speak will occur in mondays episode when she marries an old flame 
dryer who at 6foot6 is the tallest of tvs cops pondered a 
visitors theory it had nothing to do with kramers departure 
the theory was that pro football playersturnedactors seem to 
be more successful and tend to have longer runs in network series 
if theyve played on the defensive line 
two examples merlin olsen and alex karras the former piled up 
more than seven years in nbcs little house on the prairie 
father murphy and the shortlived aarons way karras had 
four abc years in webster 
true former running back ed marinaro had five seasons as a 
costar of hill street blues but the much betterknown 
quarterback joe namath lasted only one month as the star of nbcs 
the waverly wonders 
dryer thought about all this his eyes took on an evil glint 
well he said i think the true intelligence is in defense 
 
elsewhere in television 
another reason to continue living an nbc movie based on the 
archie cartoon strip will be shown sunday in it archie 
veronica jughead and betty now are thirtysomething and coping with 
adult problems like divorce careers and single parenthood 
bergens everywhere frances bergen mother of the star of cbs 
murphy brown will be the guest star of the shows may 21 
episode in which corky faith ford gets married mrs bergen who 
plays the grooms mother probably will be watching the may 19 
edition of nbcs saturday night live with great interest 
candace bergen will be the shows host

bonds are not the only junk peddled in the 
securities markets there are junk companies too financed by junk 
bonds there is plenty of junk analysis too 
ask the folks who make up the housing and real estate markets 
those people who have had to read one brokerage house analysis 
after another about how it no longer pays to own a home junky 
analysis they say 
as an investment the wall street analysts contend housing has 
had it prices have run up so far that buyers have been priced out 
of the market the demographics are turning therell be a slowdown 
in buyingage population 
many of the analyses including some from academe have been the 
basis of stories about the great housing bust the coming collapse 
of housing prices the ominous recession in real estate crumbling 
castles and the like 
such notions so irritated the national association of home 
builders that it countered with a special report pointing out that 
housing is not a security is not wildly traded is more than an 
investment and has basic innate value 
it has not stopped wall street a brokerage house analysis just 
issued grows enthusiastic about the demise of the singlefamily 
home as the american familys primary investment now it suggests 
people will turn to securities 
the analyst contends that adjusted for quality and price 
change the average american homeowner is worse off today than he 
or she was in 1980 
really housing people ask 
in 1980 the median price of singlefamily homes was 64000 by 
late last year just before the decade closed the median was more 
than 125000 or close to double an increase greater than 
inflation in general 
this after putting up just 10 percent of the price living in 
the house for a decade watching children grow up enjoying unique 
income tax deductions having the use of lowcost equity loans 
paying down the mortgage 
the reality of home price underperformance in the 1980s has 
been very slow to sink in many people clung and in some instances 
still cling to the expectations of renewed appreciation the 
analysis continues 
perhaps they do but meanwhile they have a roof over their heads 
and a foundation under their feet which is more than can be said 
for some of the junk companies that wall street recommended in the 
1980s 
but why housing industry people ask should home prices 
collapse or barely keep pace with inflation because say wall 
streets analysts housing has been priced beyond the means of 
buyers prices must fall to meet the market 
maybe so but isnt the market there those same analysts have 
been saying for years that millions of americans couldnt afford 
houses and it is unlikely that they will have disappeared at the 
very time opportunity arrives 
but the analysts say the youngfamily bulge that supported 
homebuying in the 1980s will flatten in the 1990s yes say the 
housing people and that means builders probably wont build as 
many houses as in the 1980s 
aside from these considerations the home builders point out 
other salient considerations that tend to support prices 
buildable land the biggest single factor in housing costs is 
not growing in supply if anything building and environmental 
codes may become even more strict labor costs arent likely to 
plunge 
while people dont necessarily need stocks and bonds and from 
time to time foresake the markets in them they do need homes most 
people wouldnt be caught without one

for nearly a decade states in the mississippi delta region have 
pursued tough education reforms and they are starting to get 
results 
last month kentucky gov wallace wilkinson signed legislation 
that will overhaul public education the changes were enacted after 
the state supreme court in june found the public school system 
inequitable and unconstitutional 
spending per pupil varied district to district from 1800 to 
4200 now a state minimum 2900 has been established in 
addition the new kentucky law calls for committees of parents 
teachers and principals to make daytoday school decisions 
in mississippi gov ray mabus also signed legislation in april 
continuing education reforms begun in the early 1980s that have 
raised standardized test scores for the last four years and 
increased accountability by requiring district report cards 
one measure commits 182 million to curriculum improvements in 
the next three years another calls for 800 million in bonds to 
replace aging school buildings and buses mabus has said hell call 
a special legislative session in june to work out how to finance 
the plan 
arkansas education reforms have reduced class sizes added 
support personnel and expanded the curriculum particularly 
language science and math courses 
a 1cent sales tax hike and a teacher testing policy were among 
reforms pushed by gov bill clinton in 1983 
since then his office says 1400 people who failed the teacher 
tests are out of the classroom 17000 more students are taking 
foreignlanguage classes than in 1983 15 percent more students are 
attending college dropout rates have improved and test scores are 
up 
in tennessee a draft of gov ned mcwherters 1991 package 
spells out 12 major goals from requiring kindergarten to better 
preparing college freshmen to do collegelevel work 
the plan also calls for performance audit teams in the state 
education department 
reforms in louisiana have included reducing classroom size 
rewarding successful schools and raising teachers pay though hard 
times in the states petroleum industry have cut revenues one 
effort gov buddy roemer is pushing is a 30 million computerbased 
reading lab 
the states still fall behind much of the nation in per pupil 
spending 
according to the national center for educational statistics in 
washington the national average expenditure was 4243 in 198788 
the last year for which complete figures were available 
the comparable state figures were kentucky 3011 
mississippi 2548 arkansas 2989 tennessee 3068 and 
louisiana 3138

us sen bennett johnstons slide into a 
fourth term should have been well greased by his 2 million 
campaign war chest and plenty of pork barrel power after 18 years 
on capitol hill 
instead the democratic senator already is embroiled in what he 
calls a rock em sock em race with iconoclastic republican 
state rep david duke the leader of the national association for 
the advancement of white people and a former ku klux klansman 
with voting still five months off the charismatic duke has all 
but blown away attention for state sen ben bagert of new orleans 
endorsed by the louisiana republican party to challenge johnston 
louisianas oct 6 open primary is a candidate freeforall 
without regard to party if johnston does not get a majority he 
could be forced into a runoff in the november general election 
david duke attracts attention from everywhere the kind of 
free coverage he gets is worth literally millions johnston said 
it will be a media circus for david duke before this thing is 
over with plus hes raising a good bit of money 
duke a relentless campaigner draws huge crowds as he 
crisscrosses the state and money pours in from all over the 
country he said hes raised 800000 with the formal registration 
for candidates still three months away 
duke should not be written off lightly he is young he is 
intelligent he handles himself very well he is not the type of 
person to be considered a buffoon because he is not said former 
gov edwin edwards a freewheeling democratic populist who served 
three terms edwards suggested he would enter the senate race 
himself if it looked like a republican would defeat johnston 
duke 39 has cloaked himself in the drape of gop conservatism 
a recent statewide mailing touts working for welfare no new taxes 
gun rights and the elimination of affirmative action 
in johnstons hometown of shreveport state rep alphonse 
jackson a black democrat said dukes support is mindboggling 
ive even heard some blacks say theyre voting for duke 
because he is for equal rights i tell them what duke says and what 
he means are entirely different it sounds crazy but he could get 
some black vote jackson said 
it doesnt surprise me people are for me duke said a 
lot of blacks who pay taxes and work hard they dont like the 
welfare system the cycle of poverty the welfare system has been 
the worst enemy of blacks and poor whites in this country 
duke as grand wizard unmasked the kkk ushering the white 
supremacists from night rides to family picnics and public 
politics he left the klan in 1980 accused of trying to sell a 
membership list to a rival faction and formed the naawp 
under the glare of international spotlights he was elected to 
the louisiana legislature from a nearly allwhite house district in 
1989 despite endorsements for his rival from ronald reagan and 
george bush 
duke says his racism and nazi sympathy were youthful errors as 
a legislator he claims to be a spokesman for equal rights for 
everyone 
im not looking for support from someone who wants to put down 
others who wants to take away the rights of others duke said 
that message goes a long way with his supporters 
what david duke represents is not what people think im not 
talking about nazism or the kkk im talking about what i call 
equality said ted andrus 67 of mandeville who contributed 
1000 
i like the principles which he elucidates no special 
treatment for anybody said robert graham 84 of escondido 
calif who contributed 700 
johnston 57 drew the wrath of some american conservatives in 
1987 when he worked to defeat the nomination of judge robert bork 
to the us supreme court the louisiana gop accused johnston of 
being a liberal and declared him vulnerable 
as chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee 
and the appropriations subcommittee on energy and water 
development johnston controls some purse strings vital to oil 
gas and waterrich louisiana 
johnston drew no serious opposition in 1984 when he pulled in 
86 percent of the vote this time around he said his latest 
statewide poll gives him 56 percent of the vote to 20 percent for 
duke and 13 percent for bagert 
i think the vision i have for louisiana a new economic base 
unity for the state strong education environment thats what 
people in louisiana are concerned about more than whether we can 
put the black man back in the back seat johnston said 
a shreveport journal newspaper poll in march showed johnston 
with 32 percent duke 26 percent and bagert 17 percent of the vote 
in shreveport and bossier city in northwest louisiana 
more recently a university of new orleans poll showed johnston 
with 43 percent bagert 13 percent and duke 12 percent of support 
from new orleans metropolitan voters 
this is probably the worst duke is going to do in any part of 
the state said pollster susan howell 
racism sells he is a good performer hes a handsome fellow 
that sounds very nonthreatening he has that populist appeal that 
everybodys after him and hes just aw shucks one of us 
johnston said

something about nebraska sen bob kerrey sends 
normally cynical democrats into a swoon 
hes a softspoken sensitivelooking war hero who quotes yeats 
and dates actress debra winger raises money by the bushel and has 
a 75 percentplus approval rating in a conservative republican 
state 
hes an ambitious man yet by all accounts a man who could 
easily walk away from politics friends and acquaintances speak 
admiringly of his daring his independence his humility his 
curiosity his depth his kindness 
they compare him to john kennedy and gary hart jerry brown and 
david letterman mario cuomo after the 1984 democratic convention 
they talk about his star quality his medal of honor his blue eyes 
he might as well have hot presidential prospect stamped on 
his high pale forehead 
the guy has made an impression like nobody ive seen in a long 
time said dan payne a democratic media consultant based in 
boston 
everything about him is unusual by any standard said 
harrison hickman who has done polling for kerrey since 1982 if 
he decided to run i think he would be great ive said since i 
first met him he could be anything he wants to be 
joseph robert kerrey 46 has made his mark in many spheres he 
joined the navy as a seal lost his lower right leg in vietnam and 
came home an opponent of the war he got married had two children 
and got divorced made millions as a restauranteur served a term 
as governor and then declined to run for reelection 
but two years later in 1988 he ran for a senate seat and won 
frustrating nebraska republicans who had thought they would no 
longer be up against his charisma and apparent invincibility 
hes not only been a teflon governor but he was a teflon type of 
candidate for the us senate said state gop chairman norm 
riffel 
kerrey was sworn in only 16 months ago but already many 
democrats see in him the inspirational candidate they need to win a 
national election 
frequent media mentions and network television appearances are 
signs of what some commentators dismiss as a shortlived kerrey 
boomlet but others believe the attention will translate into 
something more significant and lasting 
hes on a roll and also on a cusp as payne puts it he can 
either go the way of jerry brown and burn out like a comet or tap 
the energy and the excitement and the brightness that emanate 
from a new star 
thus far kerreys moves in the direction of national politics 
are tentative he hasnt set up a fundraising operation bt he has 
hired bill shore a hart veteran as a top aide and traveled to 10 
states to give speeches and meet with local officials and political 
activists 
kerrey says he wants to be a good senator from nebraska but he 
hinted at a broader kerrey vision and leadership style at a 
texas democratic party dinner last february in houston 
it is important he said for us simply to reach down 
inside of ourselves and decide what we think ought to be done and 
then declare it without fear of what somebody else might say 
his priorities include universal health care investment in us 
roads water systems and other infrastructure reducing the 
national debt and establishing an educational trust corporation to 
help schools that are struggling to improve 
his primary role so far however has been as a combative and 
knowledgeable protector of the agriculture interests so vital to 
his state 
he also is closely identified with indochina he recently 
returned there on a factfinding mission his first visit to the 
region since a grenade shattered his leg and ended his military 
service 
it was hard kerrey said hesitantly when asked about the 
trip in one television interview theres an attachment there and 
at the same time theres part of me that never wants to go back 
the way i live anyway is to put that stuff behind me 
the war experience did leave a legacy of extreme caution about 
sending us troops into combat for example kerrey opposed the 
invasion of panama and he has said he does not want his son to 
confront the same decisions he did when he was a young man 
kerreys background gives him great authority and what some have 
called a bulletproof vest on issues of war peace and patriotism 
and he is outspoken on all three the political outcry over 
flagburning was a recent example 
kerrey skewered president bush for leading the charge for a 
constitutional amendment to protect the flag the president chose 
the path of least resistance and greatest political gain he said 
kerrey himself initially jumped on the same bandwagon but 
changed his view after reading supreme court opinions on the 
subject referring along the way to philosopher john stuart mill 
and the smell of my own burning flesh on a vietnam battlefield 
kerrey concluded that america does not need our government to 
protect us from those who burn a flag 
it was a characteristic reversal 
one of his hallmarks is that he always reserves the right to 
change his mind said sen james exon dneb he is one of the 
few men that ive ever heard say that as often as he does i dont 
think that means hes not dedicated to his beliefs but he always 
keeps an open mind 
which is one reason 1990 is probably too early to predict what 
kerrey will do in 1992 another is kerreys disregard for schedules 
and rulebooks and sticking to an advance plan 
one of the things that made him a marvelous combat officer was 
his ability to sense changes in field conditions and adapt to 
them said richard d herman a longtime friend who is editorial 
page editor of the lincoln journal 
kerrey can be incredibly blunt but he also has been accused of 
vagueness of new agespeak of rhetoric that loses its bearings 
nebraska republicans contend he isnt straight with constituents on 
where he stands 
people think hes telling them what they want to hear 
riffel said he can say a lot it sounds like a lot of substance 
but when you dissect it you look at it and you say what did he 
say 
riffel speculates wistfully that kerreys senate record will 
unmask him as a liberal and prove his undoing in nebraska but most 
observers believe nebraskans already know kerrey and his views 
they may not always agree with him but his appeal seems to 
transcend mundane political realities like votes and vetoes people 
are drawn to him a guy who tells fellow amputees about the great 
legmaker he found who reads books and drinks beer and goes to 
movies who celebrated his election to the senate by singing a 
long tragic ballad about mutilated young war veterans 
hes a remarkable man said harvard psychiatrist and author 
robert coles who has met with kerrey and corresponds with him 
he hasnt let politics go to his head yet were all praying 
for him

adam gotner badly wounded survived that 
bloody day when police opened fire on people in the street twenty 
years later solidarity runs the government and he leads a search 
for secretly buried bodies 
dec 17 1970 is etched in polish memory as a day of slaughter 
at 6 am gotner and many others were walking to their jobs at the 
paris commune shipyard 
tanks and police were posted at the shipyard gates suddenly 
the police began shooting 
gotner then 25 felt something hit his shoulder and saw his 
jacket turning red he thought of running at the tanks but i 
realized it would be instant suicide and retreated 
all this time for several minutes i could hear the shooting 
continuing and then it seemed i was stepping on people he said 
i had the impression i was stepping on bodies the whole 
street had been covered with people going to work in my mind 
there were at least 500 dead 
long afterward gotner realized most were not dead but either 
wounded or sprawling for cover 
the communist authorities had declared the port and shipyard 
closed because of unrest over governmentimposed increases in food 
prices but had not told the workers police may have thought the 
men intended to occupy the shipyard 
official accounts said 45 baltic port and shipyard workers were 
killed that day 28 of them in gdynia and gdansk many poles 
believe the number was much higher 
a committee led by gotner is trying to determine how many died 
in gdynia which means digging for bodies two excavations have 
yielded no conclusive results 
a macabre legend grew around the december events and the 
authorities contributed to it by collecting bodies and burying them 
hastily at night often with no relatives present 
tombstones erected later were allowed to say only that the 
person honored had died a tragic death no mention of the 
gdynia killings was permitted in the statecontrolled press 
attempts to investigate were blocked even in 198081 
solidaritys first brief experience of legal existence 
censorship was eased enough to allow andrzej wajda to make the 
acclaimed movie man of iron in which the 1970 gdynia killings 
are portrayed as central to the rise of solidarity a decade later 
gotner survived five bullet wounds in the chest eventually 
became a solidarity activist in gdynia and organized a civic 
committee this year to build a new monument to the victims in front 
of city hall 
soon after it was formed his committee came under public 
pressure to investigate the killings with the communist party out 
of power city officials agreed 
on a sunny april day at the witominski cemetery gravediggers 
lifted the coffin of jadwiga sikorska from a sandy hillside and 
probed a little deeper 
they found two sets of bones wrapped in cloth one was too old 
to be from 1970 the other did not appear old enough 
a representative of the prosecutors office was present and the 
remains were taken to a forensic laboratory for analysis 
mrs sikorskas son jerzy had noticed bones in the earth when 
he buried his mother in march and told the committee 
earlier 70 volunteers dug up a 60foot stretch of path in 
another part of the cemetery where witnesses had reported signs of 
newly dug graves immediately after the 1970 shootings no bodies 
were found 
experts confirmed part of the path had been dug up about 20 
years ago but only to a depth of about four feet they said there 
was no evidence the soil had been disturbed below that depth for 
hundreds of years 
there were several hypotheses and mine is that they were 
preparing to bury bodies there and then decided not to because of 
personnel changes in the government gotner said in an interview 
at his modest apartment overlooking the shipyard 
he is a slender articulate man with dark curly hair salted 
with gray and is cautious in expressing opinions about the outcome 
of his search when pressed gotner said i think it may turn out 
to be true that five or 10 more people were killed than has been 
reported 
that conclusion would not be popular alhave heard gossip that 
the fact that we have noanything proves we are on the side of the 
authorities he said 
several people claimed to have seen secret burials three 
witnesses who appeared reliable including a militiaman claim to 
have seen out 200 bodies 
gortner notever that no one is coming to us and asking us to 
find somebody despite pppeals for information 
whether the victims were more or fewer gotner said we want 
to find the truth alftruths continue to exist if we want to build 
the future 
he removed his shirt revealing scars on the upper chest and a 
very deep ein his back 
if i had known i had five bullets in me i would have died of 
fright he said and laughed 
the laughter gone gotner said doing this is my 
responsibility to the who died at that time i rememwhen i was 
walking and i saw someone falling down i wanted to to help him 
then but i could not

nancy cruzan lies comatose in a 
southwestern missouri hospital bed steven goodwin a federal 
prisoner in springfield wants to impregnate his wife by artificial 
insemination heath wilkins sits on death row in potosi fighting 
execution for a murder he committed at age 16 
these three court cases all from missouri have reached the 
us supreme court or are headed that way 
along with the high courts rulings last july on abortion and in 
april on school desegregation they have thrust missouri into the 
legal limelight to an extent perhaps unmatched by any other state 
today 
doctors say cruzan 32 in a coma since a 1983 car accident 
could live an additional 30 years with no hope of recovery her 
parents want to remove her feeding tube so she can die as they 
believe she would want the missouri supreme court refused to allow 
it and now the us supreme court is deciding the issue in its 
first righttodie case the decision is expected by july 
wilkins 21 also known as inmate number cp47 spends his days 
with 69 other missouri death row convicts at the potosi 
correctional center while he fights to get the courts to overturn 
his death sentence 
at least one argument no longer is open to him last year the 
supreme court used his case to rule that states could execute 
killers who commit their crimes at age 16 thats how old wilkins 
was when he walked into a kansas cityarea liquor store in 1985 and 
killed a clerk during a robbery 
in the abortion case the supreme court last july voted 54 to 
restore key provisions of a restrictive missouri law allowing it 
and all other states to ban any public employee from helping 
perform an abortion and to ban abortions in all public hospitals 
the court also ruled that states may require doctors to determine 
whether a 20weekold fetus was capable of surviving outside the 
womb 
the high court recently used a kansas city case to say federal 
judges may order local officials to raise property taxes to pay for 
desegregation of public schools judges however cant impose tax 
increases themselves the justices said 
the judicial pipeline from missouri to washington remains wide 
open 
goodwin 32 serving 14 years on drug charges at the us 
medical center for federal prisoners in springfield wants to 
impregnate his wife by artificial insemination the federal bureau 
of prisons has refused to allow it 
all we are asking for is a clean container and a swift 
messenger said goodwins attorney ronald kuby of new york 
goodwins appeal is before the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
the last stop before the supreme court 
observers suggest missouris sudden surge to the legal forefront 
is a combination of timing coincidence the courts growing 
conservatism and the tendency of the missouri legislature to pass 
laws that invite challenge 
we have been at the right place at the right time said 
missouri attorney general william webster and we have a supreme 
court that is interested in hearing the issues and that 
combination has permitted missouri to be aggressive 
he said the court seems more willing to consider cases that have 
not been fully litigated in the federal circuits around the 
country the cruzan case is an example 
twenty years ago it is very doubtful they would have ever 
reached out and said were interested from the federal case 
law its a brand new issue webster said 
he said the court took the wilkins case along with a kentucky 
case involving a 17yearold after the justices in 1988 overturned 
the death sentence for a 15yearold in an oklahoma case they said 
the death penalty is a constitutional punishment for murderers who 
committed their crimes at age 16 but not for killers younger than 
that 
i think it was an attempt to draw the line webster said 
as for abortion webster who personally argued the case before 
the justices said the court chose missouri over three other cases 
i think there was little doubt the new court was interested in 
revisiting the issue of abortion he said arguably ours was 
the narrowest of the four the court took this as a tentative step 
rather than a fulltilt reversal of its 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
beyond the laws are those challenging them in the courts 
beginning the process that ends at the supreme court 
state rep jim barnes who sponsored the bill that became the 
states challenged 1986 abortion law says whenever laws are made 
there are those ready to fight them 
missourians tend to make conservative laws which are ripe for 
challenge said barnes a democrat diversity generates 
conflicts and conflicts create court cases 
joyce armstrong executive director of the american civil 
liberties unions eastern missouri office agrees many missouri 
laws lend themselves to legal challenge the aclu represented 
reproductive health services inc of st louis which filed the 
original lawsuit in the abortion case 
it was lobbied very hard by the antiabortion groups she 
said of the missouri legislature they felt missouri was a likely 
state legislature that would pass such a restrictive law

in the towns along the lower mississippi from around cairo 
ill to below new orleans theres lots of talk about the good old 
days 
cairo had the highest per capita wealth anywhere they say of 
course that was 100 years ago 
in a louisiana town called waterproof people remember saturday 
night crowds so thick you had to walk through the street 
sideways 
nostalgia is hardly unique to the mississippi delta but in this 
region it may help reconcile the paradoxes that show up everywhere 
this is a place after all where the pain of slave labor took 
sweet expression in the words and rhythms of the blues 
in towns long abandoned by river trade and plantation society 
harkening back is looking ahead an antebellum mansion on a river 
bluff or an ersatz showboat may bring in tourist dollars a hope 
for the future

no but cotton gins still stand everywhere in the delta matted 
tufts catch in the stubble along roadsides including the stretch 
of the great river road that runs south through arkansas from 
the memphis bridge 
some of that may have been cotton grown by b mccollum jr 
before he retired 
he still keeps busy as a justice of the peace like his father 
before him and by telling stories by the way he says thats 
my legal name b 
my dad moved here somewhere around 1920 and named the place 
macks corner mccollum says he had a grocery store a 
restaurant a grist mill a little repair shop to work on old 
cars one day a mechanic eating lunch at the restaurant left an 
oilsmudge fingerprint on a plate to the next customer it was 
macks corner ark no more according to mccollum 
hell he said this is greasy corner and its been greasy 
corner ever since 
even says so on the road signs 
when mccollum was 8 his father gave him an acre and seed lent 
him a mule and a doubleshovel plow and said theyd split the 
profits of his sharecrop 5050 he said the best fertilizer 
you can put on your farm is your footprint and your shadow 
mccollum now owns 700 acres including the spot where he was 
born 
not everyone has been so fortunate he knows hundreds of 
farming families once lived all around but machines displaced 
them blacks especially moved to cities for jobs and just never 
came back home 
i cant blame em mccollum says recalling wages of 50 
cents a day and a justice system that often failed to prosecute 
crimes against blacks it was tough back then 
fodder for the blues and theres more traveling downriver 
into mississippi 
in tunica one of the poorest places in the country 44yearold 
mack whitfield has the dark energy of the blues in his eyes 
this is where the houses were he says gesturing to vacant 
lots along the infamous sugar ditch drainage trough where an 
outcry a few years ago led to federal action to move some residents 
from shacks to new apartments what sold out sold out they just 
knocked all the houses down 
not all several remain including the tarpapercovered shanty 
whitfield lives in and mable kinchloes house across the ditch she 
owns both wont sell out and has no trouble explaining why 
she grew up here but has lived away in chicago she was a 
teacher and at age 73 still takes substitute assignments to help 
finance repairs to the family home she returned to less than a year 
ago 
a wiry woman with glasses and no easy smile she may be that 
teacher whose lessons one most remembers most children want to 
learn she says but it seems like with these children 
somebodys been whispering in their ear you cant do anything 
 
i say we are something you can do anything that you want to 
do but youve got to study to do it and thats going to be 
hard 
of her property by the ditch she says they want to tear it 
down because its so ugly they want us out of here but were 
here because my daddy struggled too hard 
the mississippi glides southward 
it passes grave markers on the battlefield at vicksburg miss 
where grant gained control of the river after a 47day siege it 
flows past mansions at natchez where every spring as in many 
towns confederate uniforms and pastel gowns are put back on and 
the doors open to the public for pilgrimages to the antebellum 
world 
lydia mcmanus made a different kind of pilgrimage to natchez 
when as a girl she and her family were evacuated there to escape 
the 1927 flood one of the worst ever mrs mcmanus hometown 
waterproof la failed to live up to its name that time 
waterproof population 1483 has a general store a grocery 
two gas stations two banks and the western auto franchise that 
lydia and wj mcmanus ages 66 and 71 run for the companionship 
it gives them as much as anything else friends come in and 
visit she says and we might sell a pound or two of nails or a 
few screws something like that once in awhile 
when she was growing up her parents ran a restaurant in town 
and she remembers serving coffee to store clerks weekend nights so 
they could stay awake to handle the crowds trucks were sent out to 
bring plantation workers into town where theyd shop and party 
until the wee hours 
frank roach smiles at the recollection he played blues guitar 
then and still does at 74 
you had to walk through the street sideways to get up there 
so many people out of the country now all the country people have 
left he says 
peopled get themselves something to drink be talking all 
night dancing all night yes sir that was back in them good old 
days 
the only thing thats the same is the river mark twains 
symbol of eternity pushing past the bright gardens and the 
punctual ferry at st francisville past the shallows of new roads 
where baptisms were performed past blaring new orleans and finally 
pilottown to pay its debt in mud and memories to the gulf

cutting the dropout rate is one of six goals 
named by president bush and the nations governors in their effort 
to improve american schools the following report the first in a 
periodic ap series examining those goals shows how a tough high 
school in the phoenix barrio managed to lower its rate dramatically 
</TEXT>

two years ago south mountain high school was 
just another struggling school in the citys toughest section 
known only for violence and a stubbornly high dropout rate of 22 
percent 
every time i met somebody theyd say god you actually go to 
south said rick bouwense an 18yearold junior 
but this school year fewer than 10 percent of south mountains 
kids dropped out 
suddenly dramatically against all odds south mountain is 
gaining national attention as an innercity school that is solving 
one of educations toughest dilemmas how to keep students in 
school especially poor minority youngsters 
in february the bush administration and the national governors 
association listed six goals for improving us schools near the 
top was cutting the nations dropout rate to less than 10 percent 
by the year 2000 
if south mountain holds a lesson for other schools struggling to 
cut the dropout rate it is this you need money but you need 
much much more 
the bottom line at south mountain was convincing students the 
school was safe and that it had the desire to give more than lip 
service to individual students needs to do that the school 
totally restructured itself in the last two years it now has the 
look and feel of few others 
teachers spend only half the day in class the rest of the time 
they tutor kids 
students who once worried about being scorned as bookworms dont 
have to tote texts between school and home south mountain spent 
100000 just to provide extra copies for homework 
four dazzlingly equipped magnet schools attract students from 
around the city to study law aerospace the performing arts and 
visual arts and overall standards were raised to eliminate dummy 
courses like consumer math 
the school hired 70 extra teachers and added counselors 
including several who put students and parents with social or 
health problems in touch with appropriate city agencies 
and in a particularly vital step south mountain reversed its 
citywide reputation as a cauldron of violence by hiring additional 
security guards and stripping hallways of student lockers to reduce 
hiding places for contraband 
judged by statistics alone the national dropout rate defined 
as the number of 16to24yearolds without high school degrees 
has steadily improved in 1968 the us rate was 162 percent it 
now stands at 129 percent 
innercity schools however generally have much higher dropout 
rates in philadelphia for example a study released in march 
found that only 41 percent of students who entered high school in 
1984 had earned diplomas 
no comparable statebystate figures exist because states 
havent agreed on a single method for collecting dropout data 
but a recent study by brandeis university researchers concluded 
that the southwest with its large migrant and immigrant 
population has the worst regional problem southwestern states as 
a group have a dropout rate of 21 percent compared with 18 percent 
in the northeast 11 percent in the southeast and 9 percent in the 
northwest 
south mountains apparent successes havent come cheaply or 
easily 
the school lies on whats often called the wrong side of the 
dry salt river bed that divides the impoverished south side from 
the rest of phoenix crack crime and los angelesbased gangs like 
the crips and bloods have infiltrated the neighborhood 
its student body of 2700 is 54 percent hispanic 31 percent 
black and the remainder mostly anglo 
many come from troubled backgrounds as many as 200 girls get 
pregnant each year many students consider dropping out at some 
point some do like 16yearold mark 
a cherubiclooking sophomore mark dropped out of south mountain 
twice this year missing several months of school and spending idle 
hours messing around the neighborhood 
he fell in with bad company started stealing cars and wound up 
on probation just after christmas mark was shot in the foot in a 
driveby incident 
a school counselor visited several times and late in march 
mark decided to give south mountain another try 
nearly everyone here agrees that south mountain wouldnt have 
gotten very far in its dropout effort if not for the 17 million a 
year in desegregation money that has come its way on average for 
the last five years 
the money raised through a special local tax is the result of 
a 1984 federal courtordered plan to make phoenix schools more 
racially balanced 
the court gave the district wide latitude in how to spend the 
money as long as it met the goal of attracting students of all 
races to segregated schools 
south mountain spent some of its windfall on new security guards 
it was important for us to send an appropriate message said 
coprincipal art lebowitz that we do not tolerate weapons no 
gang colors no drugs no nonstudents on campus 
so far this year three weapons have been confiscated down from 
an average of five and students and teachers say drugs and 
violence are now a rarity 
much of the desegregation money was used to hire the new 
teachers and counselors and a second principal 
students say they can tell the difference 
joanne blank a sophomore who had considered dropping out 
recalls once approaching lebowitz to talk over a problem he was 
talking to a teacher but he interrupted that to talk to me she 
said he told me students come first 
people here dont wait til you hit rock bottom til they do 
something she said 
an early milestone for south mountain came five years ago when 
it opened its magnet schools as in other school districts under 
desegregation orders the hope was that such schools would attract 
whites from around the city 
today students can get private dance and music lessons at the 
performing arts school which also has a recording studio with 
professional sound mixing equipment 
the law magnet features a classroom mockup of a courtroom 
complete with a judges bench spectator gallery and a well for 
lawyers and stenographers 
this spring students combined lessons in law and literature 
when they put shakespeares romeo on mock trial the verdict 
innocent of the charge of disturbing the princes peace 
sixteenyearold hector quijada a dropout last fall returned 
to south mountain and is now preparing for a career in tv 
production in a stateoftheart studio that cost more than 1 
million to equip

<TEXT>
ive gone from fs and ds to cs and bs said quijada who 
also has a parttime job as a cameraman at a local tv station 
despite their outward dazzle however the magnets had only 
limited impact on the dropout problem by 1987 the schools 
dropout rate had fallen from about 25 percent to 22 percent 
the sluggish progress convinced phoenixs thensuperintendent 
timothy dyer that the school had to do more than buy flashy 
equipment south mountain had to break with the past 
ultimately we decided to radically restructure the school 
teachers simply couldnt deal effectively with 150 kids a day we 
have to deal with the whole child including the social realm 
dyer said 
dyer and others devised a fiveyear south mountain plan now 
in its second year again using desegregation money the school 
increased its teacher staff from 150 to 220 
key to the plans success was an agreement reached with the 
local teachers union temporarily waiving seniority rules to allow 
south mountain to handpick the new teachers 
just as crucially administrators restructured the school day to 
give teachers fewer classes and create special hours when 
youngsters could seek out tutors or make up missing work 
just raising expectations alone is absolute poppycock cutting 
the dropout rate takes a multifaceted program said dyer now 
executive director of the national association of secondary school 
principals in reston va 
south mountain also raised standards for the first time last 
fall all freshmen were required to take algebra 
as teachers we all think its working said kathy anderson 
who teaches firstyear math it gives kids more confidence and 
selfesteem 
at first they look at the work and say i cant do algebra 
then after two weeks they say thats all there is to it

its about 10 am and the temperature is already 
approaching 90 degrees as abdul akim muhammad drives his aging dark 
blue porsche down the dirt road leading to the home of larry a 
16yearold dropout 
in bygone days theyd have called muhammad a truant officer but 
in these more euphemistic times hes known as the intervention 
specialist at south mountain high school which has gained 
attention for cutting its dropout rate dramatically and quickly 
from 22 percent two years ago to less than 10 percent this spring 
for four years muhammad 49 and a burly 6footer has served on 
the frontlines of the dropout war he prowls local parks and 
convenience stores often spotting absentee kids hanging out 
mainly though he visits as many as 20 homes a day begging 
cajoling and occasionally threatening chronically absent students 
their parents or their grandparents 
muhammed and his porsche are thus familiar sights in the barrios 
and dusty backroads of south phoenix springtime is especially busy 
for muhammad as students look for more interesting diversions than 
school 
pulling up to larrys home barely five miles from the glitter 
and wealth of downtown phoenix muhammad is greeted by larrys 
grandparents an old dog with flies crawling in its eyes huddles in 
the shade 
im from south mountain i wanted to ask you where larry is 
muhammad said larry wasnt home his grandparents said they 
understood hed been suspended from south mountain for good they 
told muhammad their grandson was now working for a high school 
equivalency diploma 
well thats fine ill just check into it muhammad said 
he is an old hand at such excuses truant youngsters often mislead 
parents and grandparents about their daily whereabouts i dont 
take anyones word for it he said 
in this case larrys story checked out 
i really relate to these kinds of people he told a reporter 
accompanying him a lot of these parents dont have an education 
they dont really see the value 
some kids cant stand being successful he said when i 
talk to them sometimes they tell me you dont know what its 
like you dont understand then i say what do you mean i dont 
know and i tell them where i come from 
muhammad grew up in rural orange texas the son of a mill hand 
like many of the parents he now deals with his own folks 
couldnt see the point of staying in school 
he continued in school anyhow and eventually got into counseling 
because he was so good at connecting with youngsters and their 
problems 
nevertheless muhammad thinks schools today including south 
mountain often coddle youngsters 
in some instances we make kids weak he said im guilty 
of it too if they dont like a teacher we promise to find them 
another maybe sometimes i should say too bad youre just going 
to have to work it out

gina 14 dances in a skimpy bikini 
and waits at a bar for an american sailor to pick her up 
she is among an estimated 16000 parttime or fulltime 
prostitutes working near subic bay the huge american naval base 
that is more than 10 percent of olongapos 156000 people 
about 5000 women work in clubs in angeles near clark air base 
the other major us garrison town 
social workers claim prostitution drug use and general moral 
degradation are encouraged by the presence of the bases and their 
thousands of freespending americans 
as long as you have these military camps it will always be 
accompanied by prostitution said adul de leon chairwoman of the 
commission on violence against women a market of women will be 
available 
us officials acknowledge that prostitution flourishes near the 
bases but do not accept the blame lt cmdr kevin mukri 
spokesman for subic said poverty drives women into prostitution 
and the problem would diminish if the philippines prospered 
gina said if i were made to choose i dont want the bases to 
close because that is our source of livelihood it is well and good 
if the government can give us work so that we dont have to sell 
our flesh to those hungry americans coming here 
a study by the private prevention and rehabilitation of drug 
abusers in 1982 claimed 78 percent of male high school students in 
angeles used illegal drugs provided by americans 
evidence of prostitution can be seen in the number of amerasian 
children in olongapo 50 miles west of manila

not to worry says panamas guillermo endara 
he understands the delay in action on us aid to his beleaguered 
economy 
that probably puts him one up on a lot of us voters who may 
not see the connection between aid to panama and abortions for poor 
women in the district of columbia 
the aid bill was tied up in congress when endara the panamanian 
president who took office after the us invasion was in town the 
other day president bush said the delay was embarrassing and 
frustrating 
but when bush finally gets the appropriation bill that includes 
the aid he may veto it because lawmakers attached a provision 
dealing with an unrelated issue allowing the district of columbia 
to use local tax revenues to pay for abortions for lowincome women 
tangles like that are not uncommon in a divided government with 
a white house that is cautious on most fronts but adamant on 
politically sensitive topics and a congress more attuned to 
maneuver than to up and down votes 
those traits showed again when the house narrowly approved a 
democratic budget for the year beginning next october republican 
leaders sidestepped by withholding bushs budget from the 
guaranteed defeat of a floor vote and both sides said the real 
decisions will be made later anyhow in negotiations with the 
administration 
bargaining and compromise always have been vital parts of the 
process of legislating and governing but the tendency nowadays is 
to let them serve as a substitute for clear congressional decisions 
to govern is to choose not to cop out said rep leon e 
panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget committee 
complaining when republicans wouldnt put the bush budget to a roll 
call 
the 12 trillion 1991 budget that did pass tuesday was 
described by democratic leaders as only a first step toward 
negotiations with the bush white house 
the senate budget committee approved a budget with the same 
bottom line but sharper defense cuts 
while senate democratic leaders are skeptical about a budget 
summit it is a sharetheblame system that provides political 
protection to both sides 
president bush and congressional leaders are meeting at the 
white house on sunday to discuss the budget situation were not 
into a negotiation were talking process bush said 
the central america aid 420 million for panama and 300 
million for the newlyinaugurated government in nicaragua is part 
of a 34 billion dire emergency supplemental appropriations 
bill a must measure for scores of federal programs that are 
running short of funds it counts against the last budget not the 
next one 
because it must be passed the bill was an irresistible lure to 
senators with pet projects or peeves the senate spent five days on 
the bill tacked on 170 amendments and boosted the total 
appropriation by about 1 billion before approving it tuesday 
one of the amendments would allow the district of columbia to 
use local tax revenues to pay for abortions for poor women bush 
vetoed two bills last year because of similar provisions 
we do have an irrevocable veto threat out on the abortion 
funding of the panamanicaragua supplemental aid bill said white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater while panama and nicaragua 
aid appropriations eventually will pass a veto would mean further 
delay on emergency assistance bush sought a month ago 
along with his complaint about congressional delay bush pushed 
one of his own pet projects the line item veto presidents long 
have sought that would empower presidents to knock out items they 
dont like without rejecting an entire bill 
it would be a perfect fit for bush on the bill at issue now 
because he could reject the abortion provision without sacrificing 
the central american aid money he wants with line veto power he 
also would be able to scrap some spending features the 
administration opposes 
thats why congress isnt about to agree to item vetoes for any 
president of either party it would eliminate congressional 
leverage and for most members that is an institutional matter not 
a partisan one 
in dealing with the overall budget there seems to be less 
attention to guarding congressional prerogatives than to finding a 
way that will work in this case to produce a plan including about 
55 billion in deficit reduction measures in order to meet the 1991 
target unless it is met the government faces another round of 
automatic spending cuts next year 
that means spending cuts or revenue additions at least 19 
billion more of them than were projected in the budget bush 
proposed last winter republican leaders said because of that and 
other changed conditions they were shelving the bush budget 
without a house vote 
they wouldnt have had that option but for the assumption that 
the final budget will be shaped by negotiation not floor votes 
house democrats set their negotiating base with the budget passed 
tuesday 218 to 208 
speaker thomas s foley said there should have been a vote on 
the bush budget whether republicans wanted it or not he suggested 
that be made automatic in the future 
he also called the democrats budget resolution the first step 
toward discussions with the administration 
rep bill frenzel rminn ranking gop member of the budget 
committee said house action was only the quarterfinals we do 
not get to the finals until we get to the summit where the 
decisions are made jointly he said

one breath was all it took to reduce robert 
boettcher from a hardworking farmer to a tearyeyed wheezing man 
boettcher doctors say suffers from a recently recognized 
environmental disease that often is misdiagnosed as allergies or 
asthma 
the 51yearold farmer is no longer an active outdoorsman he 
describes himself as a kitchen farmer who watches from the 
window as hired hands work the 150 acres his father taught him to 
care for 
on some nights the 6foot4 174pound boettcher finds his only 
rest while lying on the cool concrete of his basement floor 
because his lungs feel like theyre on fire he relies on 
inhalers and pills to stop the wheezing that robs him of sleep 
cooking fumes changes in humidity or temperature air 
fresheners and even dust can trigger attacks that leave him 
gasping unable to complete a sentence or take a sip of tea 
boettcher was stricken a little more than two years ago as he 
was trucking a load of produce on a warm sunday night as he 
crossed a bridge over the mississippi river his truck passed 
through a cloud of toxic fumes from an explosion and leak at a 
chemical plant 
it filled the cab of the truck before i could roll up the 
window he said 
he struggled to the gate of the plant and was taken to a 
hospital 
when i saw him in the emergency room he was primarily having 
visual problems said peter g tuteur of the washington 
university school of medicine then the respiratory ailments 
became worse and turned into a major lifestylechanging problem 
tuteur and dr john mitchell have since studied more than 20 
cases similar to boettchers and have found a category of chronic 
airway disease called reactive airway dysfunction syndrome or rads 
the doctors recently reported their findings to the world 
congress on diseases of the chest and the 55th annual assembly of 
chest physicians in boston 
if you look at the textbooks and previous literature you get 
the sense that people who are exposed to toxic fumes become 
extremely ill rather suddenly go into intensive care and either 
recover or die tuteur said 
but thats not true what we are finding is a group of 
patients not so heavily exposed none of whom needed to be 
hospitalized acutely but all of whom have experienced chronic 
problems for years 
but its hard to find people to test for the affliction tuteur 
said 
tests show that their airways do constrict when they sniff 
certain things theyre not faking but right now we cant 
identify a group of people who are at risk most of our patients 
were healthy most had no allergies and 35 percent of them didnt 
smoke theres just no identifiable target group 
the doctors said such cases often had been diagnosed as adult 
onset asthma occupational asthma or intrinsic asthma 
william c houser a pulmonary specialist and medical director 
of deaconess hospital in evansville ind said he is still not 
sure whether rads is an entirely new category of disease or a form 
of asthma 
houser said one problem is that the diagnosis is entirely 
clinical the doctor makes his diagnosis on the basis of 
observations rather than lab work 
the pattern of the syndrome shows an unusually short exposure 
sometimes under a minute and an illness that continues to disable 
patients years later 
and the doctors warn that it may be many years before the 
disease is understood well enough to find a cure until then they 
say patients will have to depend on a number of drugs some of 
which cause serious side effects 
boettcher relies heavily on prednisone a steroid even though 
it causes him to shake violently at times 
unfortunately his lifestyle his farm means so much to him 
tuteur said its his main source of identity and pride he tends 
to work at it til he drops recoups and then does it again 
i know i can keep him relatively free of his symptoms but 
that basically makes him a prisoner in his own home he wont stand 
still for it 
boettcher admits there are times when he just has to get onto 
his land 
i love the land and now i know ill never be able to really 
get back to it boettcher said when i do go out i know whats 
going to happen to me i know im going to get sick enough to die 
i call it paying for my sins 
the worst part is the loss of independence he said 
ive been my own boss since i was 16 now those pills and 
those inhalers are my boss i dont know what im going to do the 
doctor tells me that i should move to arizona 
they tell me that if i stay here i may get closer to the land 
than i want to be they say it will be a 6by6foot plot

altitude sickness afflicts one of four 
visitors to colorados mountains its effects range from nausea and 
headaches to death according to a study under way at this rocky 
mountain resort 
one victim was howard shapiro a 40yearold new york city 
lawyer he flew out of newark nj on a monday morning in 
february arrived in denver about noon and drove to this ski resort 
at above 9000 feet altitude 
i became very dizzy lightheaded at the onset i was short of 
breath but that seemed to abate pretty quickly the headache went 
from mild to severe and then the constant vomiting shapiro 
said 
at some point in time dying seemed the lesser of two evils 
he said 
in the morning at the resorts snake river health center he 
was asked to participate in an experimental program he was placed 
in a red gamow bag which resembles a backpackers tube tent air 
pressure in the bag is increased 
we take him down to higher pressure and lower altitude its a 
simulated drop from keystones 9300 feet to about 4300 feet 
said university of colorado graduate student jim kasic who is 
involved in the study by the colorado altitude research institute 
based at the clinic 
in two hours shapiro could eat and drink again 
bengtake jaurin 35 a microbiologist from umea sweden 
complained of the same symptoms after arriving at frisco altitude 
9036 feet he went to his room and was found dead the next 
morning jan 19 an autopsy showed he died of respiratory failure 
due to high altitude pulmonary edema an abnormal accumulation of 
fluid in the lungs 
the problem involves dozens of millions of people 13 million 
visitors to colorado alone each year said dr charles houston 
founder of the institute 
altitude sickness has been found to afflict 23 percent of those 
surveyed so far at the clinic he said 
it doesnt mean theyre incapacitated said houston of 
burlington vt but with simple measures we think we can stop at 
least a dozen preventable deaths a year from altitude sickness in 
colorado make that 12 to 20 deaths that are preventable houston 
said 
the institutes study staffed by graduate students and 
supervised by doctorboard members of the nonprofit snake river 
health clinic began last june about 1700 adults and teenagers 
have been interviewed at keystone ski resort so far 
no one has looked at the 8000to10000foot level and mr 
and mrs joe public how well or how poorly they tolerate altitude 
particularly if they have heart or lung disease houston said 
he estimates the clinics research could save each of the 
states major ski resorts 3 million to 5 million a year in lost 
income and litigation he says losses to the states ski industry 
due to highaltitude sickness approach 55 million a season 
cathy kruzic spokeswoman for colorado ski country usa said the 
figures would be hard to verify she asked chief executive officers 
from the states ski areas about the estimates during a recent 
meeting 
they were extremely surprised by that figure and would 
certainly want additional information to qualify those numbers 
because its not something that has been of major concern in terms 
of lost revenues to the areas kruzic said 
houston 76 began research on altitude while a mountain climber 
in the himalayas in the 1930s and 1940s and while with the navys 
air arm during world war ii 
houston said altitude sickness is a mixture of problems that 
often occur together 
acute mountain sickness which includes headache nausea 
vomiting shortness of breath fatigue and sleep disturbance 
high altitude pulmonary edema water accumulation in the lungs 
that can be fatal 
high altitude cerebral edema in which water accumulates on 
the brain it also can be fatal 
symptoms can be treated with medication but the disease can be 
prevented houston said 
prevention is to take a couple of days to get here spend a 
couple days in denver at milehigh altitude and then come on up 
here to 9300 feet he said 
houston explained what happens to the body within an hour of 
arriving at a highaltitude 
first breaths come deeper and faster second the heart beats 
faster and puts out more blood per stroke third bonemarrow 
begins making more red blood cells to carry oxygen 
in addition body cells undergo enzyme changes and the kidneys 
excrete more urine to get rid of excess bicarbonate there is 
something going on in just about every organ as the body tries to 
adjust he said 
clinic medical director dick nicholas said acclimatization 
generally takes a night at an intermediate altitude 
we get people taking the all night bus from kansas city they 
get on the bus thursday afternoon and get off here friday thats 
not enough time for most nicholas said 
we also feel a high carbohydrate diet can make a difference 
mountain climber studies show that on a carbohydrate diet they 
feel better rather than when on a fatty diet he said 
the study hopes to eventually provide information so people can 
make informed decisions about whether to go to high altitudes and 
how to prepare for such trips

seen from an airplane the only major 
body of water in the heart of africa could be mistaken for a 
mirage a mirror shimmering in the desert 
lake chad whose name in the kanuri language means great body 
of water millions of years ago covered 132000 square miles or 
onequarter of the african nation that now bears its name 
but although a subject of much speculation and curiosity on the 
part of european explorers it failed to appear in detail on maps 
of the continent until the late 19th century 
today fears are growing that the changing world climate and 
rampant desertification will combine to dry up the lake leaving 
behind only a memory of its outline in the sahel region south of 
the great sahara 
several million fishermen and farmers in chad and other 
countries depend for their livelihood on the lake that has shrunk 
to about 3200 square miles last year chadians alone pulled 
100000 tons of perch and catfish from the lake for smoking and 
shipping to the rest of the country 
natron a mineral extracted from the lake for fertilizer is 
sold in gunny sacks to merchants in ndjamenas bustling market for 
shipment south to chads best agricultural land 
during the seventh summit of the 26yearold lake chad basin 
commission in yaounde cameroon earlier this year the presidents 
of chad cameroon and nigeria urged increased international aid to 
save the lake and the area that depends on it 
experts at the meeting suggested however that the governments 
of the countries bordering the lake have themselves neglected its 
resources because of simmering disagreements over boundaries and a 
civil war 
jacques lemoalle a french government hydrobiologist spent 1963 
to 1977 studying lake chad and returned recently to check reports 
that the lake was fading away 
since 1967 the lake has been shrinking progressively the 
most remarkable decline was at the end of the 196872 drought when 
high spots on the floor began sticking out effectively dividing 
the lake in two he said in an interview 
lake chad is fed from the south by the chari river which rises 
in the central african republic and is then joined by the logone 
the chari is gorged with water during the rainy season usually 
july to october but then recedes to a sluggish meandering course 
that seems to take forever to reach the marshy reedfilled lake 
the whole basin is a relatively unstable system lemoalle 
said this is the third time the lake has been this small since 
the beginning of the century 
the african development bank is funding a fiveyear 20 million 
program to pump new life into an earlier lake chad project a first 
group of experts in irrigation and vegetable farming arrived 
earlier this year to advise on more efficient ways of growing 
millet sorghum and okra staples of the region 
the arab bank for economic development in africa and the islamic 
development bank are providing 18 million to build polders land 
for farming reclaimed from the lake through a series of dikes

some states are considering whether to ban use 
of a synthetic hormone to increase cows milk production but the 
federal government has allowed the milk to be sold to the public 
even though it hasnt approved the hormone for commercial use 
no one has been able to refute the us food and drug 
administrations conclusion that dairy products and meat from 
animals treated with the hormone are safe for people 
but many are uncertain about what they see as an invasion of 
essential foods and say not enough is known about longterm effects 
of bovine somatotropin pronounced sohmatuhtropein or bst 
ive got four girls here ages 1 to 9 and i dont want that 
stuff in my milk said chuck brown a minnesota legislator he 
led a successful drive for a temporary ban on the genetically 
engineered hormone known also as bgh 
it seems to me that no 1 the cows dont want it the vast 
majority of dairy farmers in this state dont want it the 
consumers dont want it so who wants it the four companies making 
it who are we working for brown said last week from his 
appleton minn home 
the companies monsanto agriculture co eli lilly co upjohn 
co and american cyanamid have applied to fda for marketing 
approval the homone injections increase a cows milk production 
from 10 percent to 25 percent and the worldwide market for bst has 
been estimated at more than 500 million a year 
critics have not suggested a specific health risk but say not 
enough research has been done to be sure the hormone would be safe 
for people 
it would be the first major biotechnology product to reach the 
agriculture market although fda approval is not expected for about 
a year the agency has allowed milk from test herds being treated 
with bst to be sold to the public way below 1 percent of the 
milk would come from these cows and it generally is mixed usually 
at dairy cooperatives with milk from other herds bonnie aikman 
an fda spokeswoman said 
there is no way for a consumer to know but several companies 
including bordens and some supermarket chains said they would not 
use or sell products from cows in the bst test herds 
jeremy rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends 
and a frequent biotechnology critic is campaigning for a boycott 
against bst 
dairy farmers are worried about how consumers might react to 
products from treated cows and some say increased milk production 
will lower prices hurting small farmers a temporary ban was 
approved last month in wisconsin and legislation is pending in new 
york pennsylvania and vermont 
and at the request of patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
senate agriculture committee the general accounting office is 
reviewing fdas assessment of the risks of bst 
leahys concern was prompted in part by an fda veterinarian who 
said he was fired after alleging that testing of bst was flawed 
aikman acknowledged the controversy over milk safety but added 
that the fdas veterinary people said it is one of the safest 
drugs that they have reviewed 
in addition to human safety the fda must determine if bst is 
safe for animals and the environment and whether it does what it 
claims to that is increase milk production 
monsanto spokesman gerry ingenthron said research has been 
conducted for a decade and the studies have raised no concern 
about the safety of the product 
the treated cows he said are injected with synthetic bst a 
protein made from the animals genes that is virtually the same 
as a protein they already produce bst is also a natural product 
of cows pituitary glands 
proponents claim the injections of synthetic hormone produce no 
changes that affect the safety of food opponents say too little 
work has been done on too few cows to reach conclusions about 
effects on cows and people consumer groups also complain that fda 
and the companies involved should make test information public

scientists say the zebra mussel will spread 
to inland waters following the first confirmed sightings in lake 
superior 
this isnt going to just affect anglers said dennis pratt 
western lake superior fisheries manager for the wisconsin 
department of natural resources this ones going to affect 
industry boaters and the ecosystem is going to take it on the 
chin 
discovery in march of the mussel in the twin ports of duluth and 
superior wis proves the pest is established in all the great 
lakes scientists say 
the invader brought via the st lawrence seaway in the ballast 
of european freighters was found last month on eight of 26 st 
louis river buoys inspected 
experts say the halfinch barnaclelike shellfish multiply so 
fast that colonies of millions may turn up soon they can clog 
water valves foul city water systems and pollute beaches 
they have a twoyear reproductive cycle i think youll start 
seeing them next year in big numbers pratt said and once 
theyre here theres almost nothing that can be done to stop them 
pratt said 
zebra mussels have caused millions of dollars in damage in lake 
erie and lake st clair great lakes environmental officials say 
virtually all the hard surfaces in the two lakes are covered with 
zebra mussel beds at least an inch thick 
the creatures also have accumulated two inches thick and clogged 
water intakes at five cleveland electric illumination co power 
plants monroe mich was forced to close its water plant for 
three days when zebra mussels were so thick on intake pipes they 
slowed water flow 
dead zebra mussels can give off offensive quantities of methane 
gas and foul city water supplies 
environmentally its feared huge colonies of zebra mussels on 
rocks and shoals will disrupt fish spawning especially walleye and 
lake trout they also are believed to increase the spread of 
parasites damaging to fish and waterfowl 
a bill moving through congress asks for 40 million to help 
combat the mussels the mussels total economic damage in the great 
lakes could hit 5 billion by the turn of the century a 
congressional study said 
the mussels apparently have few natural enemies and it is 
unlikely theyll be food for humans because theyre so small and 
carry parasites 
scientists on the lower great lakes are experimenting with 
ultrasound vibrations to keep the mussels away chlorination also 
seems to help as does electric shock and speeding the water flow

arizona state university scientists said 
they have have created a molecule which converts light into energy 
almost as efficiently as the natural process of photosynthesis and 
stores it the way a battery would 
the development one day could lead to new methods of harvesting 
solar energy the chemists said 
nobodys going to put the kind of devices were making now on 
their roof and start harvesting energy said devens gust a 
leader of the team from the universitys photosynthesis research 
center 
he said silicon solar cells already in use were much more 
practical for such purposes but the microscopic asu device may be 
suited to drive chemical reactions 
the researchers published the details of their work in the april 
13 issue of the journal science 
gust said the researchers call the device a pentad molecule 
because of its five active parts a critical factor in its success 
is its ability to change light into electrically charged chemicals 
and store the energy he said 
he said the molecule does that by separating the positively and 
negatively charged parts of atoms and holding them about 
onebillionth of a centimeter apart at opposite ends of the 
ladderlike molecule 
the synthetic molecule can capture and store 83 percent as much 
energy as its natural counterparts gust said 
mark wrighton chairman of the chemistry department at 
massachusetts institute of technology said efficient molecular 
electronic components could radically increase the speed and 
capability of computers 
gust said one problem with using the molecule in consumer 
electronics is its size 
the traditional approach to electronics really has been a 
materials approach gust said you start out with something 
such as bulk silicon then you devise ways to make devices from 
that bulk silicon that are smaller and smaller 
using the molecularelectronics approach he said you design 
the device at the molecular level then you try to figure out ways 
to incorporate these molecularsized devices into large 
macroscopic electronic circuits 
such applications may be years away gust said

american general corp stunned suitor torchmark 
corp by putting itself up for sale and analysts said a foreign 
buyer is more likely to come up with the 7 billion needed to buy 
the nations fourthlargest insurer 
american general surprised shareholders by announcing the 
decision at their annual meeting wednesday just after telling them 
that they expected to beat back a proxy challenge from torchmark 
for control of the company 
the announcement sent the companys stock soaring 750 to close 
at 4762 a share on the new york stock exchange as 71 million 
shares traded hands in composite trading 
my feeling all along was that something was going to happen 
said ronald frank an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york i did not anticipate that it would be something as drastic 
as a sale 
i had expected american general to win the proxy fight and 
to continue to mount a defense said james ramenda with 
burlington partners in avon conn 
torchmark officials welcomed the move and expressed confidence 
that they would be able to discuss a merger proposal with american 
general 
based on todays announcement regardless of the proxy vote 
we intend to make another proposal to combine torchmark with 
american general torchmark chairman ron richey said 
ramenda however said opening the bidding may make it more 
difficult for torchmark to win 
this announcement suggests american general directors have 
taken a philosophy of anyone but torchmark ramenda said 
torchmark did not have a strong cash offer and i dont think 
they have a lot more cash to put on the table they are going to be 
looking for a stronger cash offer he said adding that torchmark 
may need a partner to make a successful bid 
torchmark made an unsolicited cash and stock offer of 50 a 
share or 634 billion in march but withdrew the offer and opted 
instead to wage a proxy fight to elect five of its own nominees to 
american generals 15member board 
torchmark also urged shareholders to approve two resolutions 
calling for american general to hire an investment banking firm and 
appoint a committee of independent directors to evaluate 
acquisition proposals 
the birmingham alabased company best known for its liberty 
national mutual insurance subsidiary is much smaller than its 
target torchmark has assets of 5 billion compared with 32 
billion for american general which has subsidiaries operating in 
50 states and canada 
frank said he did not think torchmark had a great deal of room 
to increase their bid at around 50 to 55 a share thats a 
pretty full price from the standpoint of making the economics 
work 
at 55 a share american general would fetch about 7 billion 
chairman harold s hook said american general was vulnerable to 
a possible takeover at a discount price and therefore decided to 
offer itself for sale to realize the maximum value for stockholders 
we are confident we elected our slate of directors hook 
said to loud applause from 650 shareholders attending the meeting 
i wish that was the end of the story he added before 
announcing the decision to seek a buyer 
the decision was made at a tuesday evening board meeting hook 
said if the company isnt sold in one piece the board would be 
prepared to sell operating subsidiaries separately he added 
analysts expect the company to be sold to a single buyer though 
hebert goodfriend with prudential bache research in new york 
said several companies are interested in american general he would 
not disclose any names but said i can say there are more foreign 
companies than domestic 
my guess is that a lot of japanese or european companies have 
a longterm plan to invest in this country this company is just 
too big a company to ignore its such a big opportunity and it is 
friendly ramenda said

greyhound lines inc unveiled a new summer 
advertising campaign that ignores a strike by its drivers just as 
the bus company agreed to go back to the bargaining table for the 
first time in six weeks 
the campaign drops greyhounds 30yearold slogan of leave the 
driving to us and uses a new jingle touting bus travel as a 
window seat on america 
the operator of the only nationwide bus system also announced 
here wednesday a reduced fare program for some northeast and 
midwest markets where business has been slow to recover since 
6500 drivers and some 3000 clerical and maintenance workers 
walked out march 2 
separately the company and union said they would resume 
negotiations saturday in washington they would be the first talks 
since march 18 
weve got some good things happening here theyre hellbent on 
getting a contract bernard e delury director of the federal 
mediation and conciliation service said at a washington news 
conference after meeting with both sides 
greyhound spokeswoman liz hale said that although the company 
has been operating reduced schedules during the strike recent 
expansions have restored service to about 869 percent of 
prestrike locations further expansions are planned as the busy 
summer traveling season approaches 
the strike has not hampered our ability to bring back service 
to most markets that we were serving before the strike started so 
most of our passengers are finding that they can go to their 
destinations she said 
about 35 million passengers have ridden greyhound since the 
strike began in recent days loads have been running between 53 
percent and 58 percent of last years levels the company said 
union officials have disputed greyhounds figures on restored 
service putting it at about 20 percent of prestrike levels 
the union claims greyhound faces a mounting cash crunch the 
company created through a 1987 leveraged buyout has a 9 million 
interest payment due may 15 greyhound has said it will be able to 
make the payment 
ms hale citing company policy would not disclose the cost of 
the ad campaign 
greyhounds past owners have used television campaigns but ms 
hale said the current owners have used radio exclusively because 
it fits our demographics greyhound says its passengers tend to 
be students or from lowincome families 
the campaign which debuts monday and is to run through august 
features three versions of a jingle the ads will run on nationwide 
networks serving more than 3000 stations and in 11 large 
metropolitan areas 
the jingle in gospel rock and blues renditions urges 
travelers to take a window seat on america take a greyhound 
cruise dont need a lot of money to be traveling in style 
the reduced fare promotion puts a 99 cap on oneway fares with 
no advance purchase requirements the fare is good friday through 
june 13 and includes chicago plus connecticut maine 
massachusetts michigan new hampshire new jersey new york ohio 
pennsylvania rhode island and vermont 
greyhound also lowered round trip fares in a dozen new england 
markets 
the promotion is the second to target the northeast since the 
strike during the easter travel period greyhound offered free 
tickets in some markets if buses did not run on time 
wages and the question of whether replacement drivers will be 
given permanent jobs over strikers will be the top issues in this 
weekends talks greyhound vice president anthony p lannie 
predicted at the washington news conference 
the company walked out of negotiations in tucson ariz on 
march 18 because of the shootings and bomb threats against buses 
and terminals nationwide 
since then the dallasbased company has refused to resume 
negotiations until a week passed without incident that deadline 
passed on monday 
the company is satisfied that the violence is behind us 
were anxious to move forward with negotiations lannie said 
noting that it has been 10 days since a shooting or bomb threat 
occurred 
edward m strait president of the amalgamated council of 
greyhound local unions told the news conference the union has 
condemned the violence and urged strikers who know the responsible 
parties to turn them in the union has been willing to resume 
negotiations all along he said

the streets of this western pennsylvanie 
community sparkle but not because theyre paved with gold 
usx corp which owns the edgar thomson works in braddock on 
wednesday said it would investigate the cause of coatings of 
sparkling dust on sidewalks and streets 
the dust damaged the paint on three nuns cars at the good 
shepherd church 
people have complained of damage to their cars and other 
painted surfaces said ronald chleboski deputy director of the 
countys air pollution control bureau 
the dust concentrations exceed pennsylvania standards chleboski 
said 
the steel mill is most likely responsible for the dust levels 
because they were reduced 44 percent during a steelworkers strike 
in 1986 and 1987 he said 
the dust has appeared several mornings a week during the past 
three months said monsignor charles owen rice a member of the 
allegheny county board of health 
usxs steel division will start a study of the dust within a 
month and report to the health board within five months said

the debate continues over what federal 
regulatory agency should oversee financial products that cross the 
line between securities and futures 
reps dennis eckart dohio and dan glickman dkan have 
sponsored a bill that would merge the feuding securities and 
exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission 
into a single markets and trading commission 
glickman was slated to explain the bill in testimony before a 
house subcommittee today 
the idea has some highpowered opposition though 
on wednesday federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan said 
he was uncomfortable with the idea of concentrating regulatory 
authority into single agency 
there have been calls for either merging the two agencies or 
giving the sec authority over stock index futures financial 
products that allow investors to speculate in the stock market 
without having to buy the underlying stocks currently they are 
regulated by the cftc 
one choice with which i feel uncomfortable is the 
concentration of regulatory authority in a single agency 
greenspan said in a luncheon speech to a joint conference of the 
cftc and the futures industry institute 
i am concerned that the costs could well outweigh the benefits 
from a simpler decisionmaking process the head of the nations 
top economic policymaking body said 
earlier wednesday cftc chairman wendy gramm said wall street 
jealousy was behind the push to give the rival sec some or all of 
her agencys jurisdiction 
there are two motives gramm said in the keynote speech 
first the sec wants more regulatory power 
she added that some on wall street want to turn back the clock 
to an earlier time because the securities sector is jealous of 
the performace and market share of the futures market 
she continued rather than compete directly with financially 
innovative firms and products or respond to a fastchanging 
economic landscape they under the umbrella of the sec want to 
regain better times simply by grabbing the success of the futures 
market 
an offandon feud between the sec which regulates stocks and 
bonds and the cftc which oversees the futures industry has been 
escalating recently over who should have jurisdiction over 
hybrid financial products such as stock index futures 
gramm said effort that should be spent on market reform is 
being sidetracked by this unproductive timeconsuming and 
competitively damaging turf fight 
the debate over jurisdiction has heated up unquestionably 
said greenspan the outcome could affect the longterm health of 
our markets including the ability of domestic markets to maintain 
their role as a leader in creating innovative products 
hybrid products have elements of both securities and futures 
contracts a federal appeals court has said the cftc has authority 
over anything with the slightest element of a futures contract 
that has prompted sec chairman richard c breeden to complain 
that the split regulatory authority is driving financial innovation 
out of the united states and letting foreign markets trade in 
copycat hybrid products 
but gramm said splitting off stock index futures from cftc 
jurisdiction would only hurt the overall futures market 
eliminating this exclusive jurisdiction could result in 
regulatory chaos by allowing futures which all have the same 
economic purpose to be regulated under multiple and different 
regulatory systems she said in one of her sharpest criticisms of 
attempts to limit cftc authority

smirnoff the onetime vodka of the czars 
banished during the bolshevik revolution is back in the ussr 
with a distinctly american flavor 
heublein inc has taken advantage of easing eastwest trade 
restraints to ship smirnoff back to the soviet union where it was 
first distilled in the 1800s said vivian brooks heubleins 
director of public relations 
smirnoff has really reached the point where it represents all 
that is chic and fashionable about america brooks said 
the farmingtonbased liquor and wine company has been bottling 
vodka under the smirnoff name in the united states for more than 50 
years acquiring the formula from russian exiles in the 1930s 
peter smirnoff first distilled his vodka in 1818 in moscow 
brooks said and through the next century became the official 
supplier of vodka and liqueurs to the court of imperial russia 
in 1917 as the bolsheviks took control of the government 
moscows businesses and industries were taken over by the red army 
and vladimir smirnoff then running the family distillery was 
jailed and sentenced to death as a symbol of czarist oppression 
smirnoff was rescued by the white army and made his way to 
france where in the early 1930s he sold the family formula to 
rudolph ly bought the smirnoff formula 
and rights for heublein in 1939

the henley group inc a holding company 
for businesses spun off from alliedsignal inc said it would spin 
off its two largest subsidiaries to shareholders 
the conglomerate plans to spin off burr ridge illbased pneumo 
abex an aerospace systems manufacturer and pittsburghbased 
fisher scientific group a laboratory equipment manufacturer 
the restructuring is designed to raise the total value of 
henleys investment michael dingman chairman and chief executive 
officer said wednesday in a statement from the groups hampton 
headquarters 
shares in the companies will be spun off to existing henley 
shareholders in the third quarter subject to the approval of those 
shareholders the distribution of shares is expected to be 
nontaxable henley said 
before the spin off henley will boost pneumo abexs equity and 
reduce its 1 billion debt the actions will leave the subsidiary 
with assets of more than 1 billion and annual sales of about 700 
million 
to raise equity henley will buy pneumo abexs braking materials 
business for its fair market value cancel some of pneumo abexs 
debts held by henley and contribute henley debentures to the 
subsidiary 
henley also will contribute 2 million intel corp shares to 
pneumo abex and the same amount to fisher and will receive 
warrants to buy 15 percent of each companys stock 
fisher has assets of approximately 600 million and annual sales 
of about 900 million 
henley will file for security and exchanges commission approval 
and hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider and the 
spinoffs later this year 
after the spinoffs henley will consist primarily of the pneumo 
abex brakingmaterials business an 82 percent stake in cape horn 
methanol ltd which produces methanol from natural gas in chile 
and henleys remaining 147 million shares of itel stock 
the move is the latest in a series of spinoffs that began in 
1986 when henley was formed by alliedsignal to spin off 35 
businesses henley in turn has made many of those businesses into 
separate public companies 
well have smaller units serving individual markets that are 
better understood and valued by shareholders rather than having 
them remain part of a large diversified company company 
spokesman norman ritter said markets tend to undervalue 
conglomerates because they are harder to understand 
pneumo abex has operations worldwide fisher groups largest 
operations include fisher scientific co of pittsburgh and the 
instrumentation laboratory of lexington mass

blearyeyed workers of the night take heart 
scientists have found a way to help you get a decent days sleep 
a simple combination of bright light at night and total darkness 
during the day can help nightshift workers quickly adapt to their 
upsidedown hours researchers found 
the approach appears to be the first quick practical cure for 
the nightshift blues the onthejob sleepiness and daytime 
insomnia that plague many of the nations 7 million night workers 
the principal developer dr charles a czeisler of bostons 
brigham and womens hospital said more testing needs to be done 
before employers start installing new lights 
but if the approach matches its early promise it should 
readjust peoples biological rhythms in just two nights so they 
stay awake when their bodies ordinarily want to sleep 
they certainly have made a breakthrough in understanding the 
effect of light in humans said dr mary carskadon of brown 
university their evidence is very powerful there needs to be 
more trials in the field to determine the efficacy in a broader 
sense but i think that what theyve done really gives us a 
guidepost to pursuing this research 
the technique works this way 
people moving to the night shift reported to work in this 
case a hospital lab at midnight and spent the next eight hours 
sitting at a desk while they worked a bank of lights 4 feet away 
shined with 16 coolwhite 40watt bulbs 
then they drove home pulled down blackout shades in their 
bedrooms and stayed in total darkness from 9 am to 5 pm 
after just two days the time on their internal clocks shifted 
dramatically so they felt fresh and awake when they ordinarily 
would have been asleep 
its very important in critical jobs to make sure that people 
are alert on the night shift said czeisler we collected data 
on 4000 shift workers and found that 56 percent reported nodding 
off at least once a week these include people driving frontend 
loaders running nuclear power plants policemen and chemical 
workers 
czeisler described the results of his groups experimental use 
of the approach in eight young men in a report in todays new 
england journal of medicine 
scientists read the time on peoples internal clocks by checking 
their temperatures ordinarily peoples temperatures hit their 
lowest ebb in the wee hours and this is when they are least alert 
if they happen to be awake 
during the studies a comparison group worked at night under 
regular lights and slept with ordinary window shades pulled after 
a week their temperatures continued to reach their low point 
during the early morning 
in contrast those who got the lightdark treatment noticed an 
immediate improvement in their alertness and performance 
our subjects said it was startling how much better they felt 
at night said czeisler it was no longer an ordeal to stay up 
all night 
those getting the treatment were able to sleep two hours longer 
a day than the comparison group tests also showed dramatic shifts 
in when their bodies made hormones and produced urine 
the work provides new clues about the effect of light signals 
that travel along nerves from the eyes to the brains hypothalamus 
the metronome that keeps all the bodys functions running on time 
dr thomas roth of henry ford hospital in detroit called the 
work a tremendous leap forward 
but before employers try to put his findings to work czeisler 
said more study needs to be done to simplify the necessary light 
array test the approach on older people and women and see how it 
works on larger groups

representatives of congress and business are 
criticizing president bushs proposal to drop restrictions on sales 
of sophisticated computers and hightechnology products to the 
soviet union and eastern europe 
we think this helps us have a more realistic trade approach 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said when the plan was 
announced wednesday 
but bushs proposal made after prodding by western allies was 
attacked from two sides for going too far and not going far 
enough 
i think this is another rebuff to the people of lithuania 
who are being squeezed in an economic blockade from moscow said 
sen alfonse damato rny soviet intransigence in lithuania 
should not be rewarded 
but herb linnen a spokesman for atampt said we see it as a 
start and a hopeful sign but we dont think the proposal goes far 
enough he pointed out that it would not allow poland which has 
purchased atampt equipment to acquire digital communications 
capabilities common in the united states 
the move would eliminate 30 categories of goods and technologies 
from a list of 120 restricted items while curbs on 13 others would 
be eased 
careful study indicates that most of the goods and 
technologies that we currently control to eastern europe and soviet 
destinations are of low strategic value and should be 
decontrolled fitzwater said 
in addition to computers the affected products include 
telecommunications equipment such as cellular communications 
systems satellite ground stations microwave systems and fiber 
optics equipment and precisiongrade machine tools 
for 40 years the united states and its allies have imposed 
strict export curbs on high technology sales to warsaw pact nations 
and china to prevent them from buying equipment that could be used 
to produce weapons 
but pressure has been building to relax the controls as a result 
of changes in eastern europe and the soviet union businessmen 
throughout the west have also argued that much of the restricted 
equipment has been readily available to the east on world markets 
fitzwater acknowledged some western allies favor a more 
liberalized approach than bush has recommended and predicted a 
mixed reaction for the proposal in congress 
fitzwater said bushs proposal was unanimously endorsed by us 
security agencies as well as the pentagon and state department

top trade officials from three continents 
are holding what are described as freewheeling discussions aimed at 
breaking a stalemate in the most ambitious round of global trade 
talks ever undertaken 
us trade representative carla hills leader of the american 
delegation warned that failure of the freetrade talks could 
sentence all countries of the world to gravely diminished 
prosperity 
the talks which began with a dinner wednesday and conclude 
friday were being held at a posh country club and resort in the 
heart of california wine country they involve japan european 
countries and canada along with the united states 
hills who set the agenda for the meeting told reporters that 
rather than have the delegations read position papers she had 
drawn up a detailed set of questions she hoped would prompt an 
exchange of ideas on how to resolve their differences 
i dont want to have a script read to me she said adding 
that the informal talks were meant to be more freewheeling than 
structured 
the bush administration has made successful completion of the 
multinational talks its top trade priority it hopes that freer 
world trade will expand overseas sales by american farmers and 
businesses and thus reduce the huge us trade deficit 
the trade talks which involve close to 100 countries began in 
uruguay in 1986 and are being conducted under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
while many believe the gatt rules governing trade are badly in 
need of modernization the differences over how to accomplish this 
are so great there is fear the talks could fail 
the administration is pushing to scrap costly agricultural 
subsidies predicting such a move would boost us farm sales by 
11 billion annually this effort is opposed by the 12nation 
european community which wants to protect its smallersized farms 
the united states would also like to see tougher safeguards 
enacted to prevent patent and trademark piracy which costs 
american companies 60 billion annually 
however third world countries such as india are objecting to 
this proposal developing countries also take issue with another 
american aim to expand gatt rules to cover trade in services such 
as banking and insurance 
developing nations see huge multinational companies as a threat 
to their infant service industries 
hills said the industrial countries had to keep promoting the 
idea that open markets would expand investment in third world 
countries and lead to greater prosperity 
speaking to a group of business writers in san francisco on 
wednesday before the trade talks opened she called the 
negotiations the last best chance this century to create the 
trading rules we so sorely need for the next century 
hills painted failure of the talks in stark terms of diminished 
living standards for both industrial and developing countries 
down one path lie open markets expanded trade economic 
growth and prosperity she said down the other lie closed 
markets nations turned inward and gravely diminished prosperity 
for all 
hills said she was hopeful the three days of discussions would 
provide enough guidance to allow lowerlevel negotiators to draft a 
preliminary text at a july 23 bargaining session in geneva 
switzerland that in turn could serve as a basis for clearing up 
as many issues as possible before the scheduled final round of 
discussions dec 37 in brussels 
the trade talks are also on the agenda for the sevennation 
economic summit to be held in houston in july 
hills said she believed it would be very helpful for bush and 
the other world leaders to give a political push to the 
negotiating effort

twa chairman carl icahn says he has been 
negotiating for several weeks with phoenixbased america west 
airlines to have the smaller carrier take over many of twas 
domestic operations including its hub in st louis according to 
published reports 
the st louis postdispatch said in todays editions that icahn 
and officials of the twa pilots and machinists unions met tuesday 
with america west president mike conway at icahns mt kisko ny 
offices 
icahn said in an interview wednesday that the discussions with 
america west constitute a contingency plan in case he is unable to 
get concessions from the unions 
most twa employees are union members america west is nonunion 
icahn said several hypothetical deals were discussed at the 
meeting 
they would not be purchasing anything we would not be 
getting any cash icahn said of the possible deals under 
discussion instead he said the nonunion airline simply would 
take over many of twas domestic operations resulting in a 
reduction in operating costs 
union officials however said they did not know what to make of 
the proposals calling them quite whacky 
we walked out of there shaking our heads said tim connolly 
of the international association of machinists 
marty whalen a staff attorney for america west declined to 
comment on the discussions conway was unavailable for comment 
icahn has been seeking salary and workrule concessions from 
twas unions saying that he needs the concessions in order to buy 
or lease new planes to expand twa the carrier lost 300 million 
last year 
were at a crossroads said icahn who noted that he has 
cash to purchase new airplanes on one hand we cannot buy them 
unless we get the salary cuts otherwise it is ridiculous to buy 
more planes just to lose more money 
connolly said the meeting was intended to pressure the 
pilots 
icahn denied the charge the alternative is to just bleed to 
death he said and that is an alternative that we will not 
take i hope the choice is that we grow but if we must we will 
shrink

containing bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets 
at a retail store electronic scanners at the checkout record 
the information contained on the tags the stores computer records 
the fact that an item has been sold using the information the 
computer can automatically reorder goods from levis 
as orders are shipped by levis the companys distribution 
center generates packing slips and sends them electronically to the 
stores computer the store now knows what is coming and when to 
expect it 
stores receive preticketed levis products in boxes printed 
with a bar code on the side this bar code is crossreferenced to 
the electronic packing slip number when stores scan the bar code 
they eliminate the need to count the merchandise by hand and the 
goods can be sent directly to the store shelves 
under an improvement in the system to be introduced soon 
levis computers will automatically reorder denim and other

general motors corp today reported its 
firstquarter profit fell 54 percent and ford motor cos earnings 
plunged 69 percent both due to slumping us sales and production 
cuts 
both companies overseas earnings were hurt by economic 
uncertainty in brazil while ford also suffered from strikes in 
great britain the earnings declines were less than had been 
anticipated on wall street 
combined the big three automakers reported this week that they 
earned 129 billion for the quarter down 64 percent from the 
yearago period big three revenue during the period fell 11 
percent to 6127 billion 
gm said it earned 710 million or 102 a share on revenues of 
3011 billion during the quarter compared with a 155 billion 
profit or 237 a share on revenues of 3324 billion in the 
yearago period 
gm chairman roger smith and president robert stempel said the 
company improved efficiency at its north american operations 
despite production cuts and incentives which in march included 
firsttime rebates on minivans 
ford said firstquarter earnings for its financing arm ford 
motor credit co rose 14 percent to 1159 million 
overall ford said it earned 5062 million or 110 a share 
during the first three months of this year compared with 164 
billion or 344 a share during the same time last year 
revenues for the quarter fell 9 percent to 236 billion from 
2587 billion in 1989 
on tuesday chrysler corp reported a 71 million firstquarter 
profit though earnings were down 80 percent from yearago levels 
the performance was still far better than analysts had expected 
ford said it earned 160 million from its us operations during 
the quarter down 80 percent from last year largely because of a 26 
percent reduction in car and truck production during the quarter 
most of which occurred in january 
gm and ford have relied on earnings from their overseas 
operations to compensate for sagging performance in north america 
chrysler has little presence overseas 
ford said today that the economic problems in brazil where ford 
and west german automaker volkswagen ag operate the joint venture 
autolatina may continue to hurt the companys earnings 
the company also said its share of the us car market slipped 
to 218 percent down half a percentage point from where it was at 
the end of last year in recent years fords market share has 
increased slightly while those of gm and chrysler have slipped in 
the face of intense competition from japanese automakers 
ford chairman harold poling and president philip benton said the 
company believed its market share will increase as its 1991 models 
become more available fords new escort subcompact among the 
bestselling cars of the past decade went on sale april 26 
fords cash reserves stood at 39 billion on march 31 down 
from 57 billion at the end of last year the companys capital 
spending for plant improvements equipment and other matters 
amounted to 16 billion during the threemonth period 
each of the big three automakers severely cut production in 
january temporarily laying off thousands of workers and added new 
incentives in a twopronged effort to deflate newvehicle 
inventories which had ballooned to more than 90 selling days worth 
at the end of december 
the strategy worked and the automakers entered spring with 
inventories in the 65day range considered good for that time of 
year 
but the production cuts and incentive costs ate away at 
firstquarter profits

the new venture will be called bmwrolls royce and will 
collaborate with rolls royces own tay and trent jet engine

the national farmers union is in town this 
week to lobby congress for tighter federal management of the 
nations agriculture 
but the nfus bid for higher price support loan rates and 
sound supply management measures as part of the 1990 farm bill 
being drafted on capitol hill doesnt ring just right for 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
as nfu members were making their points known in house and 
senate offices on wednesday yeutter was telling a rival 
organization the american farm bureau fdderation that advocates 
of bills to boost farm program benefits ignore budget realities 
maybe these big high numbers make good campaign material back 
home but the day of reckoning is coming he said 
some 1990 farm bill amendments have been approved or are under 
consideration by congressional subcommittees that exceed limits set 
by capitol hill and bush administration budgetcutters 
recent examples include action to sweeten programs for sugar 
cotton and rice other commodities including soybeans wheat and 
feed grains would be affected by supports or payments being tied 
to costs of production 
yeutter said these proposals will be eliminated or watered down 
by the full congressional agricultural committees during floor 
debate or in conference meetings to settle differences between the 
house and senate versions 
the subcommittees are living in a dream world and will have 
to be dragged back to reality by the crunch on federal spending he 
said 
yeutter mentioned twotier dairy price support proposals 
which he said would contradict us objectives to liberalize world 
trade 
he also told farm bureau leaders that he is not going to back 
off at all on the administrations proposal for more flexibility 
in the 1990 farm bill 
the administration wants the measure which will be a blueprint 
for us farm policy over the next five years to allow farmers 
more leeuay in deciding the mix of crops they plant on their base 
acreages 
i dont know of a single farmer who wouldnt like to have more 
flexibility in his operation yeutter said 
but nfu president leland swenson says higher farm program loan 
rates and good supply management would stimulatd commodity markets 
and stabilize prices at the farm and consumer levels 
as long as were in a position where were able to produce 
more than we can consumer and export we have to have programs in 
place that stabilize supply levels around the demand for the 
products he said 
the nfu is proposing a bushelbased program in which each years 
needs would be estimated to determine the amount of farm production 
required the plan calls for disincentives to avoid excess 
production 
a twotier dairy program also is supported by the nfu farmers 
would get a specified price support for a certain amount of 
production with penalthes for overproduction

please no loud noises the corn is taking an 
afternoon nap 
on warm drx afternoons corn takes a photosynthesis siesta 
says the agriculture department and that slows its growth 
plant physiologist james a bunce of the departments 
agricultural research service said the photosynthetic rate dpops a 
total of about 30 percent on warm dry afternoons under normal 
growing conditions 
bunce found the photosynthesis slump in laboratory studies and 
confirmed it in under field conditions the agency reported 
wednesday 
as soon as the humidity directly around the leaves drops the 
leaves dry out slightly and the rate of photosynthesis drops even 
if the soil around the roots of the plant is wet he said 
bunce said it should be possible to find corn varieties that 
react less to humidity decreases or to breed the potential into 
commercial varieties that would allow corn to sleep less and grow 
more

prime minister mahathir mohamad 
doesnt like the idea but booming malaysia may soon exit the third 
world and join the ranks of newly industrialized countries 
its newly industrialized neighbors in asia south korea 
taiwan hong kong and singapore are known as the regions 
economic dragons despite robust growth malaysia remains a 
reluctant dragon 
tiny malaysia has evolved from a simple producer of tropical 
crops into an emerging economic force that manufactures products 
ranging from cars to computer chips its central bank forecasts 
growth of more than 8 percent in 1990 for the third consecutive 
year 
foreign businessmen and other analysts say malaysia is 
competitive in southeast asia in the quality and cost of labor 
infrastructure repatriation of profits attitude toward foreign 
investment overall cost of doing business and political stability 
so why the reluctance 
a key reason is official fear that developed countries will 
classify malaysia as a socalled newly developed country or nic 
which could mean an end to trading concessions that have enabled 
malaysian exporters to do so well 
the government also fears trade retaliation from the united 
states and other rich powers who could demand environmental and 
human right standards they deem acceptable to developed countries 
mahathir has described the label newly industrializing 
country as an arbitrary western notion applied by the developed 
world that may curb economic growth in developing nations 
a country risks penalties as a nic when it industrializes and 
its citizens attain a higher standard of living he said trading 
privileges such as reduced tariffs under the generalized system of 
preferences are taken away quotas are slapped on exports and the 
domestic currency increases in value making it harder for 
exporters to do business 
the chances are that these countries will languish in their 
nic status and never become fully developed mahathir said 
because their competitiveness and access to markets is curtailed 
we are interested in growing but they can keep the title and 
what goes with it mahathir said it is just that we do not 
like categorization and labels aimed at limiting our future 
growth 
he said the human rights record of a designated nic is examined 
and invariably found wanting 
malaysia already has been criticized by foreign labor groups for 
its policy toward union organizing in 1988 for example the 
aflcio sought unsuccessfully to have malaysias preferential 
trading status with the united states canceled the us labor 
group contended that malaysian electronics workers only could join 
inhouse unions 
in addition malaysia has been criticized for years for the 
indiscriminate logging of its tropical rain forest mahathir says 
the critics are illinformed or selfserving 
the thinning of the ozone layer is blamed on logging of 
tropical forests the fact that the burning of fossil fuels and 
release of cfcs chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere occur 
largely in the rich countries are significantly ignored he told 
an international conference in october 
mahathir concedes that his country will one day be recognized as 
an nic regardless of his wishes based on recent performance that 
day may be approaching fast 
manufacturing investment last year increased 579 percent to the 
equivalent of 744 billion said trade and industry minister 
rafidah aziz foreign investment rose 308 percent last year to 
497 billion while domestic investment climbed 110 percent to 
337 billion 
even without manufacturing malaysia has long been recognized as 
one of the luckier developing lands with a balanced array of 
resources a leading exporter of natural rubber palm oil and tin 
it is also an important source of cocoa pepper tropical 
hardwoods crude oil and natural gas 
industry was introduced in the 1960s with small assembly plants 
and processing of some crops motor vehicles were assembled from 
completely knocked down kits 
exportoriented manufacturing started in the 1970s led by 
semiconductor companies about 100000 people are employed in 
electronics the driving force behind the changeover from a 
commodity producer to a manufacturing power 
malaysia is now the biggest exporter of semiconductor devices 
and the third largest producer after japan and the united states 
members of the malaysianamerican electronics industry group which 
represents 15 us firms have about 40000 workers in 18 plants 
the united states is a leading foreign investor in malaysia 
domestic companies with us participation had assets totaling 6 
billion at the end of 1988 a large number of them are usowned

opec ministers agreed today to cut current crude 
production by 145 million barrels a day in an effort to push oil 
prices back up to 18 a barrel the organizations president said 
all 13 members of the cartel would contributing to the 
reduction opec president sadek boussena said at a news conference 
however oil prices dropped following the cartels announcement 
in apparent skepticism that much had been accomplished the june 
contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude was 
down 35 cents at 1833 a barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange in late morning trading 
the countries that have been pumping above their quotas agreed 
to return to their ceilings boussena said without identifying the 
violators the united arab emirates which analysts have said is 
one chronic overproducer agreed to cut its output by 200000 
barrels a day boussena said 
the agreement reached on the second day of an emergency 
session will be in effect until the end of july boussena said 
the cartel will postpone its midyear session for a month to july 
25 when it will decide its output and pricing policy for the rest 
of the year he said 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries pumped 235 
million barrels a day in april boussena said above the cartels 
official ceiling of 221 million barrels 
for the time being we decided to have a freezetime for three 
months said boussena who also serves as algerias oil minister 
though he provide a breakdown of the agreed cutbacks he noted 
that the most would be provided from countries who will go back 
to their quotas 
once production is back in line boussena said opec is going 
to withdraw a big quantity from the market we hope prices will 
restore to 18 a barrel which was the price members agreed upon 
last november 
the overproduction has created an oil surplus just when demand 
traditionally eases off in the second quarter bringing oil prices 
well below opecs current minimum reference price of 18 a barrel 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil was trading at a spot price of 1665 a barrel in london 
this afternoon down about 15 cents from late wednesday 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
stood at 1537 per 42gallon barrel last week down from 1712 a 
barrel in the first week of april 
usually they act when they are in trouble or about to be in 
trouble and thats where they are now said paul mlotok an 
analyst with morgan stanley amp co who was observing the meeting 
its clear they need to cut output by at least one million 
barrels a day if they want the markets to move up 
the glut has serious implications for opec mlotok said 
a few months of being several dollars below where they want to 
be costs them a lot of money he said 
but mlotok said he doesnt expect a repeat of the 1986 collapse 
when oil prices fell below 10 a barrel 
there is a tendency to see this as a management problem rather 
than a problem of oil collapsing they are dealing with swings in 
seasonal demand mlotok said 
the situation will improve for opec in the third quarter when 
demand begins to increase seasonally he said

wheat futures rose slightly while corn and 
soybean futures retreated in early trading this morning on the 
chicago board of trade 
the mixed early action follows a strong rally across the board 
on wednesday that was partly attributed to the agriculture 
departments decision to target china for sales of 2 million metric 
tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
expectations for more export bonus offers helped support the 
wheat market this morning but gains were limited by a bearish 1990 
us wheat crop estimate by the private analytical firm sparks 
commodities inc 
sparks pegged the total harvest at 27 billion bushels compared 
with last years harvest of just over 2 billion bushels 
sparks certainly took a bold step up in current trade talk of 
what the wheat crop is expected to be in 1990 said richard 
feltes director of commodity research for the large trading 
company refco inc 
the usda will release its first 1990 wheat crop estimate next 
thursday 
soybean and corn futures slipped amid forecasts for beneficial 
rain in the midwest 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 375 a bushel corn 
futures were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 285 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with may at 167 a

a federal appeals court has placed limits on who 
can be prosecuted for insider trading overturning the conviction 
of a stockbroker who traded on fourthhand information about the 
pending takeover of waldbaum inc 
the decision wednesday by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
also guts a key securities and exchange commission regulation used 
to prosecute anyone who trades on misappropriated information about 
a takeover 
the court unanimously said it found no evidence that former 
stockbroker robert chestman knew that information about the 1986 
sale of the supermarket chain which he received down a chain of 
family members was confidential 
after passing through several family channels it cannot be 
said that the information was confidential to any degree or was any 
more than family gossip the court said 
more important securities experts said was a 21 decision that 
guts rule 14e3 of the securities exchange act which makes it a 
crime to trade on inside information about a takeover even if the 
trading doesnt violate a fiduciary duty to a company 
the rule has been used frequently to prosecute insider trading 
cases involving takeovers in the 1980s the appeals court ruling 
essentially means the government will have to prove the defendant 
knew the information was stolen 
insider trading lacks a statutory definition but generally 
refers to buying or selling securities on the basis of 
confidential nonpublic information 
the chestman case had expanded securities law interpretation to 
encompass disclosure of secrets down a chain and hinged on whether 
chestman had a fiduciary dury to waldbaum inc no prior criminal 
case had involved confidential information passed among family 
members 
chestman who began serving his twoyear prison sentence last 
june was released from a minimumsecurity prison in allenwood 
pa wednesday evening and returned to his long island home 
chestman attorney elkan abramowitz said 
the us attorneys office was reviewing the ruling and had not 
decided on whether to appeal to the supreme court or for an 
appellate court rehearing spokeswoman deborah corley said 
according to testimony at chestmans trial ira waldbaum agreed 
in 1986 to sell the grocery business founded by his grandfather in 
1921 to the great atlantic amp pacific tea co better known as aampp 
for 50 a share or 287 million 
he told his sister shirley witkin about the deal stressing 
that the information had to remain confidential until it was 
announced publicly witkin informed her daughter susan loeb who 
in turn told her husband keith 
keith loeb then told chestman who bought 11000 shares of 
waldbaum inc for about 25 each making overnight profits of 
250000 for himself and several clients including loeb 
the securities and exchange commission alerted to the trading 
by routine postmerger stock market surveillance filed civil 
charges loeb cooperated with investigators 
chestman was charged criminally and convicted by a jury in may 
1989 on 31 counts the civil charges still are pending 
chestmans attorneys said he had decided to serve the prison 
term before his appeal was decided because he felt he couldnt get 
a job until the case was behind him

even the louvres curators would 
envy the masterpieces in the gallery next door to the lunch counter

van goghs les iris is around the corner from a few monet

theyre all fakes theyre all for sale 
a forger yes were expert forgers you could say but we make 
no attempt to deceive we dont pretend to sell original works we 
sell reproductions said ernest thomas cummins president of 
heritage house trading group ltd 
we have all the thrill of being a forger but no risk 
with prices for original art rising into the tens of millions 
some art lovers are turning to highquality copies done by expert 
artists in addition some museums confronting skyrocketing 
insurance premiums are considering stashing the authentic pieces 
and displaying a reproduction said cummins 
no major us art museum is known to be displaying reproductions 
in place of originals such a practice would raise questions about 
why people visit museums in the first place but museum security 
has become a growing concern 
last month a woman in amsterdam sprayed a rembrandt with an 
acid solution and caused minor damage in march thieves dressed as 
police officers robbed 11 paintings and other objects from bostons 
gardner museum 
bids for paintings have climbed at auction houses in 1987 
australian investor alan bond paid a record 539 million for les 
iris 
at fort lauderdalebased heritage house prices run from about 
1000 to 10000 for the paintings of paintings depending on the 
size and complexity of the original said cummins 34 a founder of 
the upscale robb report magazine heritage house which started 
producing the repainted masters in late 1987 also has opened a 
shop in carmel calif 
the heritage house works are full paintings rather than 
photographs or prints 
we deal with people who want to live with great art not just 
visit it he said 
a telephone call usually begins the three to fourmonth process 
of making a reproduction heritage house advertises in art and 
leisure publications a small classified in the wall street journal 
recently brought in dozens of inquiries said cummins 
we get all kinds of calls he said some people want 
specific paintings or copies of originals they already have to put 
in a second home on the other hand we get calls from people 
saying can you do something with a dog 
once a commitment is made cummins contacts one of the nearly 
200 european artists used by the gallery in europe where copying 
masterpieces is a centuriesold craft specially trained painters 
often use the pigments and brushes typical of the period of the 
original 
a completed painting is then placed in a frame closely 
resembling its era sometimes the gallery purchases 17th century 
furniture to use the wood for frames said cummins 
the final step is the antiquing process using chemicals and 
natural heat and humidity we can make special types of cracks 
from little spiderweb types to long splits said cummins 
to guard against misrepresentations the canvases and frames are 
stamped and the paintings contain markings only visible under an 
ultraviolet light 
were working in techniques that have been handed down for 
centuries said cummins the master copier hands down his 
knowledge to the apprentices and so on there is nothing new to 
what we are doing 
only recently however has the demand for nearperfect 
reproductions reached beyond a handful of collectors 
several european galleries now specialize in copies of priceless 
musuem works parisian gallery owner daniel delamere has gained 
status in the art world for selling repoductions and promising 
never to copy the same work again 
although delamere bills his socalled oneofakind 
reproductions as an investment that could appreciate in value 
cummins said heritage house works are merely decorations 
people want our paintings because they love art and appreciate 
a real painting as opposed to a lithograph or something he said 
thomas hoving editor of connoisseur magazine and former 
director of new yorks metropolitan museum of art said there may 
be a limited market for quality reproductions but he knows of no 
major us museum displaying copies 
some people may want these paintings in their home i do not 
see any market for museums he said 
but even known forgeries are finding a niche among art 
auctioneers last month in london bonhams gallery put on the block 
30 paintings by the late master forger elmyr de hury nearby the 
british museums exhibit fake the art of deception features 
nearly 600 skillful imitations 
international copyright laws prohibit commericial copies of 
artists works until 50 years after their death heritage house 
also does not attempt reproductions of watercolors and multimedia 
works said cummins 
cummins closely guards the identities of his copiers claiming 
many fear public disclosure would drop the prices for their 
original pieces and draw ridicule from peers 
its a very sensitive subject and most would prefer to simply 
keep it a secret he said 
still some of the artists eccentricities cannot be hidden 
we have some artists who walk around in the clothes of the 
period they are painting in said cummins sometimes we get 
letters from them written in an archaic style that you can barely 
understand its a strange business

fleetnorstar financial group was the 
darling among big new england banks but thursday it announced that 
the regions slumping economy had caught up and left it with a 98 
million firstquarter loss 
fleet had been the only of the socalled superregional banks in 
new england that had weathered the financial storm but analysts 
said the loss showed that even a wellrun bank was not immune to 
the severe downturn 
this is fleetnorstar a really good wellmanaged bank 
said gerard cassidy of tucker anthony amp rl day you dont like 
to see these numbers for a good bank it just supports our 
thinking that the new england economy is extremely weak 
an increase in nonperforming assets to 928 million was the 
underlying cause of the loss fleets first since 1974 and most of 
that 552 million was in commercial real estate which has hurt 
other new england banks 
just a month ago fleet had predicted nonperforming assets would 
total a record 600 million but noted that figure could go higher 
based on the results of a joint supervisory review by state and 
federal regulators chief financial officer john w flynn said 
regulators required more assets be included in that category than 
fleet had anticipated 
of the 928 million 412 million of those assets are 
performing assets right now in the sense that they either are 
truly current or less than 90 days past due flynn said 
nonperforming loans of 653 million up 319 million were the 
largest part of the problem real estate on which fleet has 
foreclosed rose 80 million to 275 million 
fleet stressed that although it has some problem areas its 
underlying assets are strong and it expects to return to 
profitability in the second quarter 
analysts were quick to agree with managements assessment 
their veil of invincibility has been pierced said james j 
mcdermott jr of keefe bruyette amp woods but its an exciting 
company with strong capital and should chart its way through 
these difficult times 
as with other regional banks the biggest problem was with 
commercial real estate mostly in the hardpressed new england 
market in fact the companys lead bank outside the region 
albany nybased norstar bank earned a profit of 17 million up 
2 million 
although flynn would not discuss other specific banks he said 
fleet does not anticipate the problems such companies as the 
struggling bank of new england corp have experienced 
numerically our nonperforming assets are lower than others in 
the region he said our equity capital is higher than others 
in the region and over the last two years our earnings have been 
substantially higher obviously we believe we are far more 
diversified than almost anybody in the country 
cassidy agreed noting that fleet is insulated by nonbanking 
income like mortgage banking subsidiaries and student loan 
processing centers which are less influenced by regional economic 
downturns 
long term these guys are going to be survivors and in fact 
theyre going to be expanding and theyre going to be taking 
advantage of the opportunities over the next 12 to 15 months he 
said

a proposed deal that would give 
expansionminded america west airlines inc all of trans world 
airlines domestic operations drew a large dose of skepticism 
thursday from employees and analysts 
twa chairman carl icahn said he had been negotiating for several 
weeks with the smaller nonunion airline based in phoenix and 
brought the carriers president mike conway to a meeting of pilot 
and machinist union representatives this week 
under one scenario icahn said he would give america west the 
domestic operations to reduce operating costs he did not say 
whether the growing airline would have to assume any debt as part 
of the deal 
twa headquartered in mt kisco ny lost 300 million last 
year and had to pay 366 million in interest on debts of 25 
billion the large debt has been a stumbling block in finding a 
buyer 
this is just a big mess said herb johnson president of the 
machinists union one minute out the blue icahn says he wants 
to buy pan american and then the next minute he wants to sell us 
to a nonunion airline this guy is a schizophrenic 
johnson characterized the deal as icahns the latest negotiating 
ploy rumors swept through the airlines main repair facility in 
kansas city and causing people to go absolutely wild with 
speculation he added 
johnson said workers were afraid that they would lose their 
seniority their benefits and possibly their jobs if they were to 
work for a nonunion carrier 
america west spokesman marty whalen declined to comment on the 
deal thursday we dont comment on speculative matters he said 
america west a fastgrowing airline founded in 1983 has hubs 
in phoenix and las vegas and flies 92 airplanes to 59 cities 
throughout the united states and canada 
last year the airline achieved major airline status when it 
topped 1 billion in gross revenues for the first time 
although pilots and mechanics believe a deal with a nonunion 
carrier would be disastrous for twa analyst charles mancuso of 
moodys investor services in new york said he didnt see any winner 
in the deal except maybe icahn 
it just strikes me as odd i dont see what advantage america 
west would gain from taking on debt old planes and a union 
workforce but in this business everybodys willing to talk to 
everybody mancuso said 
kent scott head of the twa pilots union agreed and said hes 
not going to take the deal seriously until he gets more indepth 
information 
scott has been talking with icahn for months about workrule and 
salary concessions icahn has said he needs concessions from the 
pilots before hell modernize twas fleet one of the oldest in the 
industry 
this seems to me to be more like a scare tactic icahns 
saying why dont you just give me my concessions instead of losing 
everything with this deal scott said 
thats how he proposed it this is your last chance to get on 
board im going to do this deal with or without you i dont want 
to pull the tigers tail but i dont think he can do it without 
us scott said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower thursday on the chicago board of trade with wheat prices 
falling late in the session following a private forecast for a 
bumper crop of winter wheat 
soybean futures posted fairly steep losses corn was down 
modestly from wednesdays close 
wheat trading turned into a tugofwar between bullish traders 
who expect the agriculture department to target more countries for 
sales of subsidized us wheat and bearish forces inspired by a 
surprisingly high wheatcrop forecast by sparks commodities inc a 
private crop statistics firm in memphis tenn 
sparks pegged the total 1990 us wheat harvest at 27 billion 
bushels compared with last years harvest of just over 2 billion 
bushels the usda will release its first 1990 wheat crop estimate 
on thursday 
after reading reports of the sparks number at first i thought 
they were wrong or i was wrong or something because it seemed so 
high said susan leighty grains analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
she noted the sparks number predicts recordhigh yields from the 
maturing winter wheat crop leighty said she expects a total wheat 
harvest of 25 billion bushels 
forecasts for beneficial rain in the midwest weighed on the corn 
and soybean markets which gave up much of the gains posted 
wednesday 
at the close wheat futures were cent lower to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 373 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at at 285 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 166 a bushel 
soybeans were 6 cents to 8 cents lower with may at 630 a bushel

the west german machinery maker 
kloeknerhumboldtdeutz ag said thursday it agreed to spin off its 
deutzallis corp farm machinery subsidiary to the us divisions 
management and an unidentified financial group 
financial details and the identity of the us financial group 
were not disclosed 
khd acquired deutzallis in 1985 the atlanta gabased farm 
equipment maker had sales of 307 million last year 
the company operates a sales and service network through 700 
dealers in the united states and canada it also makes crop 
harvesting combines at a complex in independence mo 
since 1987 khd said deutzallis has followed a strategy of 
operating in niches of the tractor market to avoid the negative 
impact of the fiercely competitive farm equipment industry 
the us company has been unprofitable in recent years but 
through consequent restructuring measures deutzallis has been 
able to narrow it 80 million loss in 1987 to about 88 million 
last year khd said 
khd which has had financial difficulties said the sale of 
deutzallis ends an unprofitable and risky involvement in the 
us farm equipment market 
khd which also confirmed thursday it was selling its aerospace 
technology subsidiary to bayerische motoren werke ag bmw said it 
now will concentrate on its farm equipment business in europe and 
north africa and on its motors and industrial machinery activities 
in the united states 
khd said it has shed operations that had about 388 million in 
annual sales since 1988 
also thursday khd reported a pretax operating profit worldwide 
last year of about 23 million compared with a 1988 loss of about 
101 million it was its first operating profit in three years khd

ashland oil co exchairman orin atkins told an 
associate to take the best deal you can in a scheme to sell 
confidential documents to irans national oil company evidence 
presented at a trial thursday showed 
atkins didnt know the july 1988 meeting with roy furmark a 
former ashland consultant was being secretly videotaped because 
furmark had agreed to cooperate with investigators 
the tape was played during atkins testimony at the trial of 
charles barnett a palm beach fla attorney charged with joining 
the plan to sell the documents to the iranian company for use in a 
lawsuit against ashland 
atkins said he was arrested at la guardia airport about two 
hours after the meeting in furmarks new york office atkins 
pleaded guilty to charges in the case last september and agreed to 
testify against barnett 
at the meeting furmark told atkins the iranians had agreed to 
pay up to 800000 for the confidential documents atkins had 
obtained from ashland in 1982 after he resigned as chairman but 
still was employed as a consultant 
they decided their iranian contact would receive 200000 
furmark would get 60 percent of the remainder and atkins would 
split the other 40 percent with barnett 
the ashland papers dealt with the 1979 sale of 283 million of 
crude oil from the iranians to a subsidiary of the kentucky oil 
concern ashland overseas trading ltd iran sued ashland in 1985 for 
not paying for the oil and ashland settled the case last year by 
agreeing to pay 325 million 
on the videotape atkins urged furmark to close the deal saying 
he needed money for attorneys fees in unidentified litigation 
involving ashland and because he recently had invested heavily in a 
coal project 
id like to get something going because quite frankly i am 
pretty well damned close to tapped out he said later in the 
conversation he said take the best deal you can 
atkins also expressed concern about keeping the transaction 
secret he suggested the money be deposited into a swiss bank and 
then perhaps funneled through a venezuelan oil concession he owned 
when furmark said the iranians were interested in getting more 
documents and possibly consulting help atkins replied we may be 
able to dont do anything on it till we see something more 
than we have seen 
the videotape showed only atkins who sat slouched in a chair 
for the 20minute meeting as he got up to leave he said lets 
get us some money and go have a drink do something practical 
atkins testified he never received any money from the iranians 
furmark who also will testify at barnetts trial pleaded 
guilty in the scheme in march he admitted showing some of the 
documents to representatives of the iranian company at a meeting in 
london 
atkins faces up to 10 years in prison and a 500000 fine when 
sentenced later this year for conspiracy and wire fraud

bmw the west german maker of luxury 
cars said thursday it is entering an aircraft engine joint venture 
with britains rollsroyce plc returning to a business bmw left 31 
years ago 
bayerische motoren werke ag said it would acquire an aerospace 
technology line of kloeknerhumboldtdeutz ag khd and then merge 
the company into a joint venture with rollsroyce 
bmw said the return to aircraft engines reflects the companys 
desire to expand into new though related industrial areas the 
company declined to disclose details of the planned transactions 
rollsroyce described the deal as both partners acquiring the 
khd aerospace unit jointly 
bmw said it will control 505 percent of the aircraft engine 
venture which will be based in oberursel just outside frankfurt 
the british aircraft engine maker will own the remainder 
the joint venture will develop manufacture and market jet 
engines of up to 20000 pounds of thrust which power small 
civilian and military jets capable of carrying up to about 100 
passengers 
the venture called bmwrollsroyce will collaborate with 
rollsroyces own tay and trent jet engine programs the british 
company said in a separate press statement but it said it would 
not merge any of its existing engine operations into the venture 
bmwrollsroyce will then commence the design and development 
of new engines of less than 20000 pounds of thrust to meet 
emerging airframe and reengining requirements in the 
75seaterplus aircraft class rollsroyce said 
a bmw spokesman said that the khd aerospace unit which is 
called khd luftfahrttechnik gmbh and located in oberursel has 
about 98 million a year in sales and employs about 900 people 
george shapiro an analyst at salomon brothers inc in new york 
said the venture appears to be an attempt by rollsroyce to boost 
its position in the aircraft engine industry 
ive always looked at rollsroyce as kind of the weak 
thirdparty player he said 
general electric co and the pratt amp whitney division of united 
technologies corp each hold 40 percent to 45 percent of the 
worldwide engine market while rollsroyce has a 15 percent to 20 
percent share he said 
the new venture will be geared up for strong growth over the 
next five to 10 years bmw officials said declining to project 
sales targets 
european aerospace industry sources suggested that the joint 
venture could aim for as much as the equivalent of 595 million in 
yearly sales within the next decade 
to reach that goal however the two parent companies probably 
would have to invest as much as 1 billion marks or about 595 
million in expansion the experts added 
bmw built aircraft engines through world war ii and by the end 
of the war it produced turbines for the newly developed jet 
airplane 
the munichbased company left the aircraft engine business in 
1959 selling its operations to the big west german engineering 
group man ag which later merged them with daimlerbenz ag 
the rollsroycebmw venture follows an industry trend toward 
joint engine operations daimlerbenz earlier this year agreed to 
link up its civilian jet engine operations with those of the pratt 
amp whitney 
general electric has filed a lawsuit challenging daimlers 
agreement with pratt amp whitney charging it violates a joint engine 
development accord between ge and daimler

union leaders from the new york daily news 
brought their battle with the parent tribune co to the media 
giants annual meeting thursday predicting the newspaper would 
collapse in six months unless its decaying printing plant is 
replaced 
but company officials reiterated their commitment to first bring 
costs under control at the newspaper before investing in new 
equipment 
stanton cook tribune cos chairman and chief executive 
officer told stockholders that 1989 was a record year for the 
company with earnings of more than 242 million but he said the 
company would not pour money into the daily news until excessive 
operational costs are eliminated 
it would be a mistake to underestimate our resolve said 
cook the advertisers deserve it and the shareholders deserve 
it 
but george mcdonald head of the allied printing trades council 
which represents 10 daily news unions in contract negotiations with 
the company said corporate officials had it backwards the unions 
would make concessions he said but not until tribune co agreed 
to substantial investments at what he called the dickenslike 
plant 
unless the investments are made now the news wont be around 
in six months mcdonald said lets stop this charade and 
settle this at the bargaining table 
his remarks prompted applause from shareholders 
both sides acknowledge that the tough contract talks are crucial 
to the papers survival and both agree the company needs to spend 
about 500 million on new color presses and a new plant 
but company officials have said they want to trim 50 million to 
70 million from the daily news annual operating costs before 
investing in new equipment and buildings 
company officials said they want to eliminate unneeded employees 
in the daily news pressroom and drivers unions employees 
representatives say the company wants either to destroy the unions 
or close the newspaper 
mcdonald said company officials promised to buy a new plant and 
presses during a 1986 labor dispute that saw unions give up 30 
million in concessions and he accused cook of breaking that 
promise 
cook denied the company or any of its officials promised new 
plants in 1986 saying no one was authorized to make such a promise 
and that all commitments made have been met 
meanwhile chicago tribune employees picketed outside the first 
chicago building where the shareholders meeting was held and at 
the tribune building to show support for their colleagues in new 
york 
roy schrode a 19year chicago tribune pressman said the 
company has tried to break the unions at the chicago tribune and 
would try to do the same at the daily news 
cook 65 also announced during the meeting that he would step 
down as tribune cos chief executive officer and publisher of the 
chicago tribune in august while remaining chairman of the parent 
company 
charles brumback tribune cos president and chief operating 
officer will become chief executive officer of the tribune co 
john madigan president and chief executive officer of the 
chicago tribune co which publishes the paper will assume cooks 
publishing duties at the paper 
in addition to its newspapers tribune co is engaged in 
publishing broadcasting entertainment production and newsprint 
manufacturing

profits fell by 54 percent at general motors 
corp and by 69 percent at ford motor co in the first quarter due 
to us production slowdowns and problems with overseas operations 
the companies said thursday 
the figures combined with chrysler corps 80 percent drop in 
first quarter net income meant an overall 64 percent profit drop 
for the big three automakers during the period 
but the results were not as bad as the 75 percent profit decline 
that analysts had expected for the companies which are struggling 
with soft markets and intensified competition from foreignbased 
automakers 
the big three earned a combined 129 billion in the quarter 
down from 354 billion in the yearearlier period big three 
revenue during the period fell 11 percent to 6127 billion 
gm said it earned 710 million or 102 per common share on 
revenue of 3011 billion during the quarter that compared with a 
155 billion profit or 237 a share on revenue of 3324 
billion in the yearearlier period 
ford said it made 5062 million or 110 a share during the 
first three months of this year compared with 164 billion or 
344 a share during the same time last year 
fords revenue fell 9 percent in the quarter to 236 billion 
from 2587 billion a year earlier 
through the end of the first quarter big three car and truck 
sales were 36 percent behind last years pace by the end of 
april sales for big threenorth american made vehicles were 61 
percent behind last years pace 
economic uncertainty in brazil where ford and gm have large 
presences dented both companies overseas earnings which in past 
years have shored up sagging north american profits strikes in the 
united kingdom further hurt fords earnings from its overseas 
operations 
david mccammon fords finance vice president said thursday he 
expected the problems in brazil to continue affecting the companys 
earnings in the coming months ford and west germanys volkswagen 
ag are linked in the autolatina joint venture in brazil 
i think we are going to see a material drag on fords earnings 
from brazil in the second quarter largely because there has been no 
production there since the 15th of march said analyst john 
kirnan of kidder peabody amp co 
on that day ford shut its autolatina plant after the government 
froze most savings in an attempt halt runaway inflation 
the plant is back in operation but it will take time to return 
production to preshutdown levels 
kirnan and david healy of barclaysbzw in new york said 
costcutting programs especially at chrysler softened the impact 
of severe production cuts in january and costs of incentives 
throughout the period 
mccammon said ford spent about 1000 in incentives for each car 
and light truck it sold during the quarter in april he said that 
cost rose to about 1200 per vehicle and predicted the cost would 
drop back to about 1000 this month 
gm and chrysler decline to say how much they spent on incentives 
the combination of incentives and firstquarter production cuts 
which resulted in temporary layoffs of thousands of workers shrunk 
dealer newvehicle stocks putting them in better shape now than 
they were at the end of last year 
inventories at the end of march were in the 65sellingday 
range considered good for this time of year and below the 90day 
levels at the end of last year 
but the production cuts and incentive costs chewed up profits 
the automakers said 
its almost like the auto industry was going through its own 
inventory recession in the first quarter and in a sense its 
coming out of its own selfcreated recession in the second 
quarter healy said 
mccammon said ford planned on running its assembly plants at 110 
percent of total capacity during the second quarter meaning 10 
percent of the cars and trucks ford builds during this quarter will 
be built on overtime 
gm plans to close its lakewood assembly plant in atlanta 
sometime late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter 
chrysler plans to shut its st louis car plant in september 
gms subsidiaries reported first quarter results on wednesday 
profits fell by 13 percent for the gm hughes defense and aerospace 
unit fell 56 percent for the general motors acceptance corp 
subsidiary and rose by 106 percent for the electronic data systems 
corp business

for the oil glut at a time when demand traditionally eases off in 
the second quarter

reflected in supplies at us ports by that time were liable

sales of subsidized us wheat and bearish forces inspired by a 
surprisingly high wheatcrop forecast by sparks commodities inc a 
private crop statistics firm in memphis tenn 
sparks pegged the total 1990 us wheat harvest at 27 billion 
bushels compared with last years harvest of just over 2 billion 
bushels the usda will release its first 1990 wheat crop estimate

the trouble seems to keep coming for the 
worlds largest defense contractor 
the market for mcdonnell douglas corps defense aircraft 
continues shrinking 3000 workers in its commercial aircraft 
division are about to be laid off and now workers at the companys 
largest union are talking about striking 
mcdonnell douglas stock which reached a high of 95 a share 
last year also is taking a beating the shares have dropped more 
than 20 percent since the end of last year and closed at 4762 
thursday 
we know its a bad time for the company said cassell 
williams president of district 837 of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers which will take a 
strike vote sunday but whats a good time for a strike whenever 
you have to 
reflecting the defense industrys woes the company posted a 2 
million overall profit in the first quarter but lost money in its 
transport aircraft business 
government work provides about twothirds of mcdonnell douglas 
15 billion in annual sales among the programs targeted for cuts 
by defense secretary dick cheney are mcdonnell douglas f15 eagle 
fighter and c17 air force cargo plane 
in an attempt to rebound the company is banking heavily on the 
booming world market for commercial jets which has strengthened as 
more world markets have opened to unrestricted travel 
chairman john mcdonnell recently announced that the company 
planned to expand its commercial sales in the united states asia 
and europe over the next five years 
fortunately theyve got the capability to shift emphasis and 
it makes sense that they do it said industry analyst paul nisbet 
of prudentialbache in new york but theyre going to have to run 
like hell to stay in the race 
mcdonnell douglas controls about 15 percent to 20 percent of the 
world commercial aircraft market compared with boeing cos 60 
percent share 
a commercial jetoriented expansion will rely on a turnaround at 
douglas aircraft the long beach califbased subsidiary that 
makes passenger airliners and the c17 cargo plane 
douglas aircraft lost 222 million last year and 84 million in 
the first three months of this year 
last week the company announced it was laying off 3000 of the 
more than 45000 workers in long beach as a costcutting measure 
officials said the layoffs were unrelated to cheneys announcement 
the previous day that he wants to reduce the size of the c17 
program by 43 percent 
in addition to cost problems douglas aircraft has been plagued 
by efficiency problems the company is having trouble meeting 
construction deadlines a problem blamed mostly on cramped 
operations 
the c17 in particular has been a problem with costs nearing 
the companys bid ceiling mcdonnell douglas will have to absorb 
the costs for every dollar over its bid for the c17 which is 
scheduled for its first prototype flight in mid1991 
the c17 is not out of the woods yet said industry analyst 
lawrence harris of bateman eichler hill richards in los angeles 
harris said mcdonnell douglas helicopter division also has been 
a disappointment with writeoffs the last three quarters on the 
ah64 apache and related problems 
at the annual shareholder meeting last week mcdonnell pleaded 
for patience saying the company needed more time to turn douglas 
aircraft around he described mcdonnell douglas as a strong 
company with weak financial results 
still mcdonnell projects the company will gain a larger market 
share than it has had for the last five years or so through 
increased commercial aircraft sales 
mcdonnell douglas introduced its md11 jet transport last year 
and mcdonnell says the company will pursue joint ventures with 
japanese companies developing highspeed commercial transports 
analysts agree that the company probably will rebound but say 
the aerospace industry works in fairly long cycles 
we are at bottom mcdonnell said but we really see it as 
a longterm investment mcdonnell douglas can and will be a major 
beneficiary of world change 
in the more immediate future there are pressing labor problems 
a 29man bargaining committee for mcdonnell douglas machinists 
and aerospace workers union voted unanimously wednesday to reject 
the companys final contract offer only hours after receiving the 
proposal district 837 represents 11850 of mcdonnell douglas 
12800 unionized workers and its contract expires on sunday 
the union must give the company a sevenday notice but 
picketing and a work stoppage could start next sunday 
we havent lost any money here said williams the union 
president their financial problems are caused by problems in 
other locations mainly california theyre trying to put douglas 
aircraft on our backs

it was just another congressional subcomittee 
hearing droning on about market regulation until rep norman 
lent rny called one of the witnesses a wacko 
then the hearing thursday on a bill to merge the securities and 
exchange commission with the commodity futures trading commission 
took off in a burst of charges and countercharges 
lent took exception to remarks by james coxon manager of a 60 
billion cigna corp fund who maintained that employees at some top 
wall street firms exchanged information about trading strategies 
and customer orders 
coxon testifying before the finance subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee said individuals at the firms were 
able to trade ahead of major market trends and the firms customers 
the practice of trading with advance knowledge of incoming 
customer orders is known as front running it is illegal in the 
securities and commodity futures markets but frontrunning between 
the markets is unregulated because neither the sec nor the cftc has 
authority over the others markets 
he said that aside from the information exchanges by what he 
called clubs he had no evidence of illegal activity and had 
not made a formal complaint to the sec or cftc 
subcommittee member jim cooper dtenn complained that nary an 
eyebrow was raised after what he termed coxons bombshell 
allegations 
then lent spoke up i didnt react to that statement because 
i didnt put much credence in it so when people start mouthing off 
about secret cabals and clubs i figure its just another wacko in 
the room 
cooper countered i dont think the cigna insurance company 
hires wackos to manage 60 billion of assets and it seems to me 
that the weighty charge is entitled to some sort of reasoned 
response perhaps even an investigation lent later he was sorry 
for using the term wacko but continued to criticize coxons 
remarks he questioned coxon heatedly about whether he thought he 
was breaking the law and if he had reported it to anyone 
coxon said he gave a copy of a speech in which he outlined the 
activities described to the subcommittee to an sec official late 
last year 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue confirmed that an associate director 
in the division of market regulation had received the speech the 
agency neither confirms nor denies investigations but mccue said 
we are aware of mr coxons concerns 
edward i obrien president of the securities industry 
association denied the existence of activities described by coxon 
i dont know if he is a wacko or not but his allegations were 
very unfocused obrien said he didnt exactly make the case 
that there was a violation of any securities law and if so what it 
was 
coxon is a former principal at morgan stanley amp co and later a 
fund manager for harvard management which oversees harvard 
universitys investments 
he said stockindex futures which let investors speculate on 
the performance of a large group of stocks without buying the 
underlying stocks are used by a smaller group that has 
determined how to game the system and benefit from volatility 
that is excessive unnecessary and perhaps induced 
in prepared remarks he read to the committee coxon said 
certain wall street firms seem prepared to foul their own nests 
by forming clubs to share proprietary customer information 
coxon said he did not know if sharing proprietary information 
was continuing 
as a former member of this club i assure you that its very 
highly organized it shares information and indeed the intelligence 
gathering that takes place would make the cia look like a sunday 
school coxon told rep edward j markey dmass the 
subcommittee chairman 
essentially the gaming takes place by knowing the entire order 
books of the major houses in the securities industries im not 
saying those houses knowingly participate in the club he said 
coxon indicated it was more accurate to say those who exchanged 
the information worked at their firm rather than for it

bond prices rose thursday after the government 
announced details of its quarterly refunding auction and a report 
indicated aprils jobless rate may be higher than originally 
expected 
the closely watched 30year bond advanced 716 point or about 
437 for each 1000 in face amount its yield which falls when 
the price rises eased to 897 percent from 901 percent late 
wednesday 
the treasury said late wednesday it would sell a record 305 
billion in new debt at its may 810 auction about 500 million 
more than the previous record set in february 
but bond traders had been concerned that as much as 35 billion 
in new notes and bonds would be sold glutting the market and 
depressing the value of existing debt securities 
the uncertainty of what would be announced has been removed 
said william veronda a fixedincome specialist at financial 
programs inc a denver investment firm it was only a relatively 
modest increase 
the quarterly refunding auctions are critical to bond investors 
because they set the background for a range of interest rates that 
help determine the value of bonds as well as the pace of economic 
growth 
low demand for new treasury debt forces the government to raise 
yields to attract buyers which can push interest rates up 
elsewhere high demand eases the pressure on yields and can help 
ease or stabilize interest rates 
bond prices also were boosted by a government report thursday 
that the level of initial unemployment claims rose a good deal in 
week ended april 21 said steven r ricchiuto chief economist at 
barclays de zoete wedd government securities inc 
the report caused some economists to revise upward their 
estimate of aprils unemployment figures due out friday 
signs of a weaker economy such as a higher jobless rate tend 
to support bond prices because they could prompt the federal 
reserve to ease interest rates 
also thursday the treasury sold 1004 billion of oneyear 
bills at an average discount rate of 805 percent up from 772 
percent at the last auction on april 5 the rates were the highest 
since last june 1 when the oneyear bills sold for 818 percent 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
securities rose lsqb point to point intermediate maturities rose 
932 point to 1332 point and longterm issues rose 1332 point to 
716 point according to telerate inc a financial information 
service 
the movement of a point equals a 10 change in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with

our firstquarter 1990 results reflect unusually severe winter 
storms in europe which reduced earnings by 34 million aftertax

trade negotiators reported no major 
breakthroughs thursday in their effort to resolve disagreements 
that threaten to derail an ambitious effort to reform the global 
trading system 
trade ministers from the united states japan the 12nation 
european community and canada held a second day of discussions 
behind closed doors at a resort in the california wine country 
the united states is seeking to boost export opportunities for 
american farmers and business by getting agreement to eliminate 
expensive farm export subsidies to eliminate barriers to trade in 
services and to toughen restrictions on copyright and trademark 
piracy 
a us trade official briefing reporters on condition that his 
name not be used said there was some progress toward better 
defining the areas of disagreement but no success at resolving the 
major disputes 
the biggest fight involves the american effort to end 
tradedistorting agricultural subsidies something the european 
community opposes 
the talks were scheduled to conclude after a final bargaining 
session on friday 
the bush adminisration has made the negotiations its top trade 
priority insisting that expanded export opportunities will help 
significantly reduce americas huge trade deficit 
the discussions which are being conducted under the auspices of 
the 97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade began in 
uruguay in 1986 
trade representative carla hills who is leading the us team 
said she was optimistic differences can be narrowed but many fear 
that unless there are significant compromises soon the fouryear 
effort will end unsuccessfully at the final bargaining session dec 
37 in brussels 
hills and the other trade ministers hoped the california talks 
would provide the guidance for lowerlevel negotiators to put 
together a tentative agreement in many of the areas during a july 
bargaining session in geneva 
there has to be substantial agreeement by july said 
canadian trade minister john crosbie who warned that failure of 
the gatt talks would result in an international trade shambles 
the european community is strongly resisting american demands 
for a total phaseout of agricultural subsidies arguing it must 
protect its small farms 
third world countries are fighting the proposals to clamp down 
on copyright piracy and break down barriers to trade in services 
arguing the developing world needs to protect its infant industries 
against huge multinational companies 
the administration claims copyright and trademark piracy costs 
us companies 60 billion annually 
in addition to pushing its proposals in the gatt talks the 
administration is being forced to battle special interest groups in 
the united states that stand to lose trade protections as well 
legislation has been introduced in congress to retain textile 
industry barriers against foreign imports peanut growers and sugar 
producers who benefit from special subsidies that limit foreign 
competition are also working to build congressional opposition 
hills has countered that american farm groups stand to gain much 
more than they will lose through eliminating other countries 
barriers she said exports of us farm products could rise by 11 
billion annually an amount equal to 3400 for every american 
farmer 
speaking to reporters after thursdays session hills said 
working groups would examine a number of issues in the hope of 
narrowing differences further before the start of fridays final 
session 
we made constructive progress she said of the talks so far 
crosbie put the chances for ultimate success at better than 
5050 because the consequences of failure are so horrific 
but the canadian trade minister said progress at this stage was 
measured by very small steps in a number of areas 
you cant put your finger on any specific thing and say it is 
a great leap forward he said 
republican gov george deukmejian of california addressing a 
luncheon for the trade ministers defended the administrations 
freetrade policies saying that competition was good for american 
industry and consumers 
from agriculture and aerospace to electronics and 
entertainment californians have created markets worldwide he 
said we engage the competition abroad and welcome it at home 
for trade stimulates innovation and delivers better products at 
lower prices

farm debt declined for a sixth straight 
year in 1989 to an 11year low and the quality of farm loans 
improved the federal reserve bank of chicago estimates 
most analysts expect the downward trend in debt to halt this 
year though fed economist gary benjamin said 
benjamin estimated total farm debt declined nearly 2 percent in 
1989 to 1356 billion from 1384 billion a year earlier he based 
the figure on recent reports from major farm lending institutions 
and a preliminary us department of agriculture assessment of farm 
loans held by all other lenders 
commercial banks are the largest source of loans to farmers 
accounting for a third of all farm debt 
the total for 1989 includes approximately 743 billion in farm 
loans secured by real estate a drop of 3 percent from 1988 
the remaining 613 billion in loans primarily reflected 
borrowing for farm operations and equipment and was down less than 
1 percent from the previous year 
compared to 1983 peaks both real estate and nonreal estate 
loans were down about 30 percent benjamin said in an agricultural 
letter published by the chicago fed 
while the 1980s marked a decade during which farm debt fell 
substantially following a period of widespread financial distress 
most analysts are looking for a modest upturn in farm debt this 
year benjamin said reflecting the painful lessons learned 
during the financial distress of a few years ago both lenders and 
farm borrowers remain cautious with respect to new borrowings 
prospects for another year of strong net cash farm earnings 
particularly in the midwest suggest that repayments on existing 
farm debts will remain favorable and that many farmers will 
continue to rely heavily on internally generated funds to cover new 
expenditures at the same time however prospects for further but 
modest gains in farmland values and farm operating expenses 
coupled with the continuing rebound in expenditures for farm 
machinery and equipment imply farm loan demand will be somewhat 
stronger this year benjamin said 
he also reported that the quality of loans on the books of 
commercial lenders improved last year 
for banks such improvements are reflected in smaller charges 
against earnings for bad loans and a drop in the proportion of 
delinquent loans 
net chargeoffs of farm loans by banks nationwide last year 
declined to less than 100 million from 140 million in 1989 and an 
annual average of 12 billion from 198486

no recession is in sight for the united states 
and other industrial countries things are looking up in the third 
world and eastern europe could become a source of dynamism for the 
world the international monetary fund said thursday 
the fund projected a rosy future in its semiannual world 
economic outlook provided governments carry out the kind of 
policies it wants to see lower budget deficits balanced world 
trade privatization of governmentowned business 
it predicts world production will grow 225 percent this year 
and accelerate to a 3 percent growth rate in 1991 that would match 
last years rate but still be behind the 4 percent growth posted in 
1988 
the industrialized countries should grow by 27 percent this 
year the fund predicts that is down slightly from its forecast 
last fall of 29 percent growth 
japan should lead the growth parade of the major industrial 
countries with a 44 percent rate this year and 42 percent in 
1991 for 1990 west germany should be in second place at 35 
percent but yield that position to france and canada in 1991 which 
are expected to grow 31 percent that year 
officials warned however that their figures could not take 
full account of german unification german forecasts expect that to 
be a sharp spur to growth 
the united states the worlds biggest economy is expected to 
lag behind with a 17 percent growth rate this year and 23 percent 
next year 
the latest 1990 forecasts for the united states and japan are 
down from last fall when the fund predicted growth of 21 percent 
and 47 percent respectively the forecast of 35 percent growth 
for west germany this year is up from last falls prediction of 30 
percent however 
the fund classes only 22 countries among its 152 members as 
industrial 
it lumps east asian tigers like south korea with laggards in 
africa and latin america as developing countries the report 
forecast their production will rise 3 percent this year 45 
percent next year by 1995 the growth rate for these countries 
should be at the 5 percent level last seen in the 1970s 
the increase in growth projected for these countries rests 
heavily on the assumption that adjustment policies are successful 
in bringing down inflation and improving the climate for domestic 
savings and investment the report said 
but it saw little scope for africa to recoup its losses of 
income in the 1980s leaders in both africa and latin american 
often speak of the 1980s as a lost decade 
the funds rosiest forecast was for asia 57 percent growth 
next year despite a downward revision for china 
it also predicted a marked improvement in growth rates for 
eastern europe though the uncertainties of recent changes and 
those to come made it wary of exact projections 
with their relatively skilled work forces the countries of 
eastern europe could emerge as a source of dynamism for europe and 
to a lesser extent for the world economy it said
