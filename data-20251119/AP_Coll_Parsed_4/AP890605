carlos menems opposition peronist party said monday that president 
raul alfonsin should step down before his term ends in december so 
menem can take office early

winner of may 14 national elections to assume the presidency 
food stores were looted in major argentine cities last week and 
14 people were killed the national and provincial governments 
expanded programs of public subsidies to ease the situation 
aides to alfonsin and menem discussed an early transition but 
failed to agree on policies to stabilize the economy alfonsin 
favors increased tariffs to balance the budget menem opposes any 
program that would further shrink purchasing power 
menem also has insisted that peronists who won congressional 
seats on may 14 take office when he does with those seats his 
party has working majorities in both houses 
menems public position has been that the decision to shorten 
alfonsins sixyear term does not depend on me but on the 
outgoing government

he menem feels the conviction that this situation cannot be

san francisco became the first city in the 
country monday to grant official public recognition to homosexual 
and unmarried heterosexual couples 
mayor art agnos signed the landmark law calling it one of the 
most important milestones in san franciscos effort to adopt 
policies to recognize the diversity of families and to extend to 
all people in our city the basic human right to form families of 
their choice 
the law has created a framework that clarifies the serious 
nature of family relationships in the lesbian and gay community and 
for other couples in committed relationships agnos said 
agnos also appointed a task force on family policy to 
determine guidelines for allowing unmarried city workers to add 
partners adult children and extended family members to the citys 
health plan 
though denounced by leaders of the citys powerful roman 
catholic church as an attack on marriage and the traditional 
family the new law won the unanimous support of the board of 
supervisors before going to agnos for his signature 
this is important legislation because its a step in helping 
our country come to terms with the lives of parts of the american 
family that have not always been dealt with particularly lesbian 
and gay couples and particularly in the time of an aids epidemic 
said harry britt president of the board of supervisors and author 
of the bill 
agnos said it would take about two months to set up the 
mechanisms and distribute the information to allow unmarried 
parters to declare their relationship either publicly through a 
county clerk for 35 or confidentially with a notary public 
he said the city attorney and the city human rights commission 
are developing an informational package that will outline the 
rights and responsibilities of the relationships 
registering under the law affirms the current city policy of 
providing city workers in nontraditional relationships with the 
same hospital visitation rights and bereavement and maternity leave 
as married city employees 
to qualify for registration a city worker must live with and 
share basic living expenses with their partner registration is 
intended only for people who live or work in san francisco 
agnos dismissed worries that the law was an invitation to gay 
couples or unmarried heterosexual couples from around the country 
to go to san francisco to legitimize their relationships 
its an invitation for gays and lesbians and all single people 
in this country and in the world to take a lesson from the san 
francisco model once again and take to their own communities the 
modern kind of family practices that are outlined here he said 
matt coles an attorney who drafted the law and previously 
helped draft similar laws in other california cities said san 
franciscos measure differs significantly from those in berkeley 
santa cruz and west hollywood 
those cities he said pay health benefits to city workers with 
domestic partners 
thats important and thats what the task force is aiming at 
here he said but what this legislation does is it recognizes 
the existence of nonmarital relationships and it recognizes them 
whether youre a city employee or not nobody in the world has 
ever done anything like that before

americans are becoming more tolerant of 
homosexuals and gay rights but that tolerance wanes the closer the 
issue gets to the home according to a national survey published 
monday 
the poll commissioned by the san francisco examiner showed 
that most heterosexuals 73 percent believe homosexuality should 
not be illegal but 57 percent disapprove of two people of the same 
sex living together as a married couple 
only 38 percent of the heterosexuals polled approved 5 percent 
said they didnt know 
and while only one in five americans knows someone with aids 
more than half of those polled said they are willing to pay 100 
more in taxes each year to find a cure for the deadly disease 
the examiner said the poll by teichner amp associates of fullerton 
is the most extensive us survey ever undertaken involving gay 
people and attitudes toward them 
the poll surveyed 3748 randomly selected people who said they 
are heterosexual and 400 who said they are homosexual or bisexual 
the margin of error ranged from plus or minus 17 percent for the 
heterosexual sample to 5 points either way for gay people polled 
the inescapable conclusion both nationally and in the bay 
area is that while people are fairly accepting of homosexual 
lifestyles in the theoretical sense they are less accepting the 
closer reality gets said pollster steve teichner 
for example one in three people polled said they would try to 
change a homosexual youths sexual orientation while only 15 
percent would try to do so with a gay friend 
other major conclusions of the poll were 
about two out of every three homosexual and heterosexual men 
and women believe discrimination of all kinds has dropped in the 
last decade 
women westerners liberals and jews tend to be more accepting 
of gays than others 
most of the respondents 81 percent said it would be 
discrimination to deny a person a job because of sexual orientation 
the south with two out of three straight people surveyed 
disapproving of samesex living arrangements is the least tolerent 
of homosexuality the west with almost half approving is the most 
tolerant the survey found

the house ethics committee soon will begin 
reviewing a complaint against republican whip newt gingrich an 
omen that the chambers ethics problems are not a bad dream that 
will vanish with the departure of speaker jim wright and majority 
whip tony coelho 
ethics committee members could begin as early as thursday at 
their next meeting to review a democratic members complaint that 
gingrich rga violated rules on outside income and receipt of 
gifts 
the allegations against gingrich revolving around a partnership 
formed to promote a book he coauthored are not the only reasons 
an ethics cloud will hover over the house while democrats try to 
divert attention from their leaders conduct 
still pending are justice department investigations of house 
members personnel practices justice department internal probes of 
leaks about those investigations the conviction of a republican 
lawmaker for having sex with a minor and more public hearings by a 
house task force considering changes in ethics rules 
but as wright prepares to leave congress rather than fight 69 
charges of rules violations and as coelho dcalif plans his 
exit to avoid repeated questions on a junk bond deal many seething 
democrats will pay close attention to the case against gingrich 
the georgia republican filed the original complaint against wright 
although the allegations he cited were later dropped 
asked if he expected to be a victim of retribution gingrich 
said last week i may be but added he would trust the judgment 
of the 12member ethics panel that is equally divided politically 
gingrich said he wouldnt be surprised if the committee 
officially the committee on standards of official conduct took up 
his case this week committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said 
the panel may consider the complaint filed by rep bill alexander 
dark within two weeks 
rep beryl anthony jr dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee said democrats do not have an 
organized strategy where we met and said were going to do a b 
or c on newt our strategy is to sit back and let the process work 
the assumption is the committee will move with deliberate speed 
theyve got nothing to gain by postponing it 
other issues that will keep ethics questions alive 
a reported justice department investigation according to 
government sources into personnel practices of house democratic 
caucus chairman william gray of pennsylvania including whether a 
noshow employee was hired gray has denied hiring any 
ghost employees 
gray told supporters in philadelphia on sunday that he will not 
end his attempt to step into coelhos post as majority whip 
a reported justice department investigation into the personnel 
practices of walter fauntroy the district of columbias nonvoting 
delegate to congress according to sources the ap learned a grand 
jury intends to begin hearing testimony from current and former 
employees of fauntroy a democrat and rep gus savage dill 
over fauntroys hiring of savages son 
a los angeles times report that the justice department is 
conducting a preliminary investigation of whether coelho received 
favors from drexel burnham lambert inc the firm that issued a 
junk bond purchased by coelho 
an investigation by the justice department into leaks by its 
own employees on the house investigations 
in chicago on sunday former presidential candidate jesse 
jackson called for an outside special counsel to investigate the 
justice department leaks to the press which he said have thrown 
dirt on grays reputation 
the press must not give credibility and propagate rumors 
innuendos and falsehoods on the american people jackson said at 
a news conference 
the decision of rep donald e lukens rohio to remain in the 
house while he appeals his conviction of having sex with a 
16yearold girl whose mother accused the lawmaker of offering her 
a government job to buy her silence 
wrights parting message in his emotional resignation speech 
last week when he suggested members are entitled to know what 
the rules mean and if they still mean what they meant when they 
were written and promulgated now maybe the rules need to be 
changed lets vote to change them 
public hearings by a house task force on ethics established by 
wright earlier this year after collapse of plans to raise 
lawmakers pay in exchange for a ban on speaking fees 
alexanders 10count complaint said gingrich exceeded outside 
earned income limits under an unusual arrangement with the 
publisher of his book window of opportunity as part of the 
arrangement a limited partnership of 22 investors paid for 
promotion and marketing of the book 
several counts charged that gingrich violated a rule prohibiting 
members from keeping gifts of more than 100 from anyone with an 
interest in legislation this allegation referred to the 
legislative interests of some members of the partnership which 
consisted of republican political activists and businessmen the 
partnership raised some 105000 to promote the book 
gingrich said at an april news conference that none of the 
investors ever received unusual or extraordinary personal help 
from him in their dealings with the federal government 
the lawmaker added that the partnership did not violate the gift 
rule because the money each investor contributed did not constitute 
a gift

mitigating ones

gibson a riverside convenience store clerk police said boyde and 
carl ellison abducted gibson after robbing the store took him to a

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the conviction and 35year prison sentence of a 
maryland man accused of armed robbery 
the justices said they will review a ruling that the conviction 
was tainted by evidence obtained unlawfully by police 
prince georges county police investigating the feb 3 1986 
armed robbery of a restaurant obtained arrest warrants for two 
suspects jerome buie and lloyd allen 
a half dozen police officers went to buies home in riverdale 
two days after the robbery and arrested him after entering the 
home they looked for him on the first and second floors 
one officer went to the basement stairs yelling for anyone who 
might be down there to come out 
buie eventually emerged and climbed the basement stairs to be 
searched handcuffed and arrested by the officer 
at that point another officer descended the stairs to the 
basement where he saw in plain view and then seized a red running 
suit a victim of the robbery had said that one of the robbers wore 
a red running suit 
prosecutors over buies objection used the running suit as 
evidence at his trial he was convicted and sentenced to 35 years 
in prison 
an intermediate state appeals court upheld the conviction but 
the maryland court of appeals the states highest court ruled by 
a 43 vote last nov 28 that buie is entitled to a new trial 
the state court said police wrongly searched the basement 
because they had neither a search warrant nor probable cause to 
believe they would find allen or any other accomplice in the 
basement 
while acknowledging that buie was arrested lawfully the state 
court said the running suit should have been excluded as evidence 
because it was seized in an unlawful police search 
the state court said police violated the ban on unreasonable 
searches and seizures imposed by the constitutions fourth 
amendment 
police who make arrests generally are allowed to conduct 
socalled sweep searches of the arrest area if they reasonably 
believe their safety is jeopardized 
but the state court said the facts in this case simply do not 
provide probable cause to support a reasonable belief that any 
other serious and demonstrable potentiality for danger existed 
in the appeal acted on today maryland prosecutors said other 
courts have not required police officers to have full probable 
cause to believe other persons are on the premises before 
conducting such searches 
they urged the justices to use buies case to fashion a 
standard for police officers and courts in such circumstances 
the prosecutors argued that the prince georges county police 
officers had a right and a duty to make certain that third 
persons including buies codefendant lloyd allen were not in 
buies basement 
the case is maryland vs buie 881369

a man who went on trial today for the 
1986 murder of olof palme denied that he gunned down the prime 
minister 
i did not kill prime minister olof palme i did not try to 
kill mrs palme defendant carl gustaf christer pettersson told 
the court the shooting was an infamous crime that i could never 
have committed 
palme was shot in the back from a distance of eight inches on 
feb 28 1986 as he walked home from a movie the gunman escaped 
down a dark side street 
mrs palme was slightly wounded by a second bullet and 
pettersson also faces charges of attempted murder 
chief magistrate michael af geijerstam called the trial to order 
in stockholm district court he broke a fivemonth news blackout on 
the defendants identity by reading petterssons name live on a 
radio broadcast 
under swedish law his name could not be released until the trial 
and he has been identified in swedish media only as the 
42yearold pettersson has a history of drug and alcohol abuse 
and a long criminal record 
during the long investigation into the slaying police and 
security agencies were accused of bungling the case and failing to 
turn up credible leads despite a reward of 8 million three 
police chiefs and a justice minister resigned at various points in 
the investigation 
palme a dynamic and controversial politician was a un 
mediator in the iraniraq war and an advocate of world disarmament 
he led social democratic governments in sweden for 11 years 
pettersson was arrested dec 14 in a twist to a case that 
previously had focused on possible international conspiracies 
pettersson who has a previous manslaughter conviction on a 
record sheet of more than 60 crimes was routinely questioned 
during the initial weeks of the investigation but he was let go 
petterssons record includes a conviction for stabbing a man to 
death with a bayonet in 1970 just a few steps from where palme was 
killed 
the prosecutions case relies heavily on the evidence of lisbet 
palme the prime ministers widow who told investigators she 
looked for an unforgettable instant into the terrifying face of 
the gunman before he fled 
but the state attorney lacks a confession a murder weapon and 
an obvious motive making a conviction by no means a foregone 
conclusion 
the trial expected to last about six weeks will be broadcast 
extensively on national radio and closely watched by a nation where 
terrorism and political assassination had previously been virtually 
unknown 
two jurors were disqualified last week after being quoted on the 
case in a stockholm newspaper defense attorneys challenged their 
impartiality and called for their replacement on the panel of six 
laymen and two judges 
a 3000page indictment handed down last week said the 
prosecution will call 33 witnesses to support their case that 
pettersson stalked the palmes down sveavagen boulevard some will 
testify he had access to a weapon and lied to investigators about 
his whereabouts 
defense lawyers indicated they would question the memory of 
witnesses testifying three years after the crime

medicare patients who want to use their own 
money to pay for an assistant surgeon in eye cataract operations 
lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment left intact a federal law that 
generally prohibits paying assistants for such surgery 
medicare a federal health insurance program for people over 65 
paid surgeons 822 million and assistant surgeons 42 million for 
cataract operations in 1983 
the surgery involves removal of a clouded lens from the eye it 
is the most common form of eye operation for the elderly as some 
one million cataract removals are performed each year 
congress in 1986 passed a costcutting law that generally bars 
medicare reimbursement for assistant surgeons in cataract removals 
the law went beyond saving the government money for paying 
assistants in such cases it also barred medicare patients from 
using their own funds unless the services were approved by an 
insurance carrier or a state committee that reviews such medical 
costs 
a group of medicare patients in new york and california and eye 
doctors and their professional associations in the two states sued 
in federal court here challenging the law 
the us circuit court of appeals last august threw out the suit 
the appeals court rejected arguments that barring patients from 
using their own money to pay assistant surgeons violates 
constitutional privacy and liberty protections 
the appeals court said not all choices made by patients and 
their physicians are matters of privacy entitled to strict 
protection by the constitution 
in the case of choosing the number of surgeons participating 
in a surgical procedure designed to save sight the prerequisite 
to a successful privacy claim would be a definite showing of 
medical necessity and the unavailability of equally effective 
alternative therapy the appeals court said 
it said there is insufficient evidence that having an assistant 
present for cataract surgery is indispensable to patient 
wellbeing 
the appeals court also said it is premature for the courts to 
determine whether the patients were deprived of liberty without due 
process 
that claim first must be tested by having patients request 
permission from an insurance company or state review committee to 
pay an assistant the appeals court said only when such requests 
are denied might there be grounds for the courts to intervene 
in the appeal acted on today the patients said the law puts 
them in an unfair position they said they can either choose to 
have the operation without an assistant present or they must give 
up all medicare benefits and pay for the entire cost of medical 
treatment themselves 
the case is new york opthalmological society vs sullivan

president bush said today he would make no 
overtures to the new regime in iran and demanded the release of 
hostages held by what he said has been a terrorist state 
bush told a white house news conference he was not sure yet 
about the implications of the change in tehran with the death of 
the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the naming of ayatollah 
ruhollah khamenei to succeed the man who led irans fundamentalist 
revolution 
the united states broke ties with iran a decade ago after the 
us embassy was overrun the diplomats taken hostage then were not 
released until january 1981 444 days later 
bush in a clear signal to tehran said there is a way for the 
relationship to improve and thats for the release of the american 
hostages 
but the president ruled out any overtures to the new government 
with which the united states has broken virtually all commercial 
ties absolutely not bush said they have been a terrorist 
state 
the state departments office for counterterrorism lists nine 
americans as hostages in lebanon as well as three britons an 
irishman an italian and a belgian all the americans are believed 
held by proiranian factions 
as soon as we see some move away from oppression and extremism 
of that nature we will review our relationship bush said 
on sunday the white house expressed hope that after khomeinis 
death iran would adopt a responsible role in the world 
community 
the white house hope was echoed by former president jimmy 
carter whose administration was hurt by the 1979 seizure of 
american hostages from the us embassy in tehran carter was 
conciliatory in comments made sunday outside his church in plains 
ga 
i know he was a great hero in his own nation carter said 
my hope is that his successor will be more inclined toward peace 
and reconciliation 
warren christopher former us state department negotiator and 
now a los angeles lawyer said i felt so long as he was alive 
there would be little improvement in usiran relations he had 
such a monstrous hatred for the us i wouldnt expect any 
immediate change but i dont think his level of hatred can be 
maintained 
despite the poor state of usiranian relations in the past 
sen richard lugar rind said sunday that bush should extend an 
open arm to iran now that khomeini has died 
appearing on nbctvs meet the press lugar said the united 
states may be able to take a new initiative in the region in the 
postkhomeini era 
president bush should reiterate the call that his gave in his 
message at the inauguration the open arm to iran clearly the 
relationship could be very different wed like to make it that 
way lugar said 
the senator said he didnt believe there are any moderates 
in iran but there may be people that we can deal with and that 
we have to hope for 
lugar also suggested that the administration should consider 
increasing the us military presence in the region 
we really need to have more resources with which to deal 
with the iranian situation he said suggesting the administration 
should think about extending american authority into the area 
during this transition and very unstable situation 
bush spent two days at his seaside estate at kennebunkport 
maine after returning from a weeklong trip to italy belgium 
west germany and england and a nato summit 
the president initially appeared unaware of khomeinis death 
announced shortly before midnight saturday 
jogging near his seaside home at 630 am edt sunday bush was 
asked by a reporter whether he had heard about khomeini when bush 
replied no the reporter shouted that the ayatollah had died 
the president declined to comment he also brushed aside 
questions about china where hundreds of people were reported 
killed in a crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators

grimsvotn and stromboli mount st helens and 
karkar etna and nevada del ruiz the names conjure up drama and 
disaster a decade of human suffering and scientific inquiry into 
the earths volcanoes 
around the world the erupting mountains that help emphasize the 
unsettled nature of the planet become the subject of intense 
curiosity when they initiate tragedy then they fade from center 
stage of interest only to scientists relief workers and local 
residents 
some of the researchers who chronicle and study these events 
have now collected a decades worth of records major ones of great 
impact and smaller eruptions notable for little beyond their 
continuing threat 
global volcanism 19751985 is largely a scientific treatise 
yet within its 672 pages of text charts and maps are detailed some 
of the most dramatic events of a decade 
an explosive eruption on 13 nov melted ice and snow in the 
summit area generating lahars that flowed tens of kilometers down 
flank river valleys killing more than 22000 people begins the 
report on nevada del ruiz the colombia volcano that became the 
fourth deadliest volcano in history 
lahars the geological term for massive mudflows generated by 
volcanoes came crashing down 11 narrow valleys into villages 
sweeping away or burying the thousands who made their homes and 
lives there in november of 1985 
a frightening noise and then a blast of wind hit us and we saw 
fire falling from the sky survivor e nieto told the scientists 
that day 
compiled by the smithsonian institution the new volume is 
published by prenticehall and the american geophysical union it 
collects reports from the first 10 years of the smithsonians 
scientific event alert network the network is a collection of 
thousands of scientists around the world who study volcanoes 
earthquakes meteors and other such events and share their findings 
with one another 
with scientific thoroughness for example they reported not

antinuclear activists blocked gates at 
the seabrook nuclear power plant today capping a weekend of 
protests that brought the arrest total to nearly 700 
police said 48 people were arrested as they sat in the road in 
front of two gates and kept workers on the 7 am shift from 
entering the plant on time they were quickly loaded into a van 
many of them dragged by officers and taken to the seabrook police 
station 
some of those demonstrators returned two hours later and joined 
others to block one gate where management people tried to enter the 
plant and at least 17 more arrests were made 
weve put in long hours and there is no reason that we should 
keep having this aggravation a frustrated police chief paul 
cronin said today and thats all it is its an aggravation for 
the town its an aggravation for the police department 
the arrests came a day after nonviolent demonstrations that 
resulted in 627 arrests the second largest number of arrests in 
one day in 13 years of demonstrations that have made seabrook a 
symbol of the nations antinuclear movement the largest was in 
may 1977 when 1414 people were arrested 
there was also a rally on saturday which attracted an estimated 
4000 people 
i think this truly marks the beginning of a new era of 
resistance to the seabrook project we will be back at this plant 
as they continue to attempt to license it said roy morrison 
shortly after he was arrested sunday on a criminal trespass charge 
protest spokeswoman dianne dunfey said protests could continue 
later in the week as the start of lowpower testing at the plant 
draws near 
employee bob mccormack who sat in his pickup truck honking at 
the demonstrators in front of him said he resented having his 
passage blocked mccormack said the protesters have a right to 
express their opinion but no right to interfere with his job 
seabrook spokesman ron sher said the demonstrators and the 4000 
people who rallied saturday at hampton beach state park were a 
vocal minority still it was the largest antiseabrook 
gathering in 11 years 
the majority of people in new hampshire massachusetts and the 
rest of new england recognize that nuclear power is a viable energy 
alternative sher said were safe were needed and were 
ready to produce electricity 
nearly three years after the 6 billion reactor was completed 
it won its federal lowpower testing license on may 26 
during the weekend seabrook engineers encountered a problem 
with a valve in a safetyrelated system but plant spokesmen 
predicted the first atomic chain reaction in seabrooks 100 tons of 
uranium fuel would start by late this week 
the plant cant win a commercial license before the nuclear 
regulatory commission approves evacuation plans for crowded beaches 
and communities up to 10 miles from the plant including 
massachusetts communities that have refused to cooperate in making 
the plans 
interviewed late sunday night at the seabrook police station 
cronin said the 627 arrests included about 75 people who were 
arrested twice 
before the weekend clamshell organizers had met several times 
with state and local police to discuss plans for the protest 
it went pretty much as planned cronin said 
the weekends demonstrations were organized by the clamshell 
alliance which has been staging protests against seabrook since 
plant construction began in 1976 
about 1500 protesters converged on the plant site sunday 
hundreds of them climbed over or crawled under boundary fences 
around the plant and sat down when they met police lines a short 
distance inside 
no protesters resisted arrest though some would not walk to 
waiting school buses and had to be dragged on some protesters 
chatted briefly with their arresting officers and shook hands with 
them 
no injuries were reported 
morrison was among about 50 demonstrators who climbed a fence at 
an abandoned railroad siding on the north side of the plant 
recreating an august 1976 protest there that was the first group 
civil disobedience ever against a us nuclear power plant 
the first over the fence was paul gunter who was among the 18 
arrested in the protest in 1976 
many of the protesters arrested in the first wave of civil 
disobedience sunday returned to the scene waving their pink summons 
slips for criminal trespassing

contributions called fixed donations made 
to the church of scientology by its members may not be claimed as 
federal income tax deductions the supreme court ruled today 
by a 52 vote the justices upheld the internal revenue 
services contention that the fixed donations are not charitable 
contributions that can be counted as tax deductions 
lawyers for the scientologists had argued that the irs singled 
out their church for unfair treatment a contention with which two 
justices agreed 
the court today acquiesces in the decision to manufacture 
a singular exception to the irs 70year practice of allowing 
fixed payments indistinguishable from those made by 
scientologists to be deducted as charitable contributions 
justice sandra day oconnor wrote in dissent 
because the irs cannot constitutionally be allowed to select 
which religions will receive the benefit of its past rulings i 
respectfully dissent she said 
oconnors opinion was joined by justice antonin scalia 
but the courts majority in an opinion by justice thurgood 
marshall said it had too little information about past irs 
practices in dealing with other religions to find any 
discriminatory treatment 
referring to the fixed donations made by church of scientology 
members marshall said we hold that such payments are not 
deductible 
federal law allows taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by 
declaring various deductions including money or things of value 
given to charities or religious organizations but such a payment 
is not taxdeductible if something of value is received in return 
a practice within the church of scientology is a process known 
as auditing in which members are expected to reach a higher level 
of spiritual awareness auditing is administered in a onetoone 
session in which the church members skin responses to questions 
are measured by an electronic device 
the church also engages in training sessions in which members 
study the doctrines and practices of scientology 
each branch of the church charges a fixed donation for training 
and auditing and almost never waives the payment requirement 
the us tax court ruled in a 1984 test case that the fixed 
donations required by the church are not tax deductible 
contributions but instead are nondeductible payments made for 
services 
three federal appeals courts upheld the tax courts ruling but 
one rejected it 
todays decision resolves the conflicting rulings and 
represents a significant defeat for the church of scientology 
the high court rejected arguments that denying tax deductions 
for the fixed donations violates the religious freedom of 
scientologists and creates an impermissible denominational 
preference 
marshall wrote for the court that the irs code defining 
charitable contributions is neutral both in design and purpose 
it may be that a consequence of the quid pro quo orientation 
of the contribution or gift requirement is to impose a disparate 
burden on those charitable and religous groups that rely on sales 
of commodities or services as a means of fundraising marshall 
said 
but a statute primarily having a secular effect does not 
violate freedom of religion merely because it happens to coincide 
or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions he added 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r white 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens joined marshall 
justices william j brennan and anthony m kennedy did not 
participate in the case 
the cases are herandez vs commissioner of internal revenue 
87963 and graham vs commissioner of internal revenue 871616

chinese government until the weekend and were shocked at the extent 
to which that restraint has now been abandoned evans said 
afterward 
in west germany labor minister norbert bluem said there should 
be a special session of the united nations on the assault 
a government that scorns human life and tramples on human 
rights must reckon with contempt from all civilized states bluem 
said in a statement

the smoot is no longer moot 
the smoot was invented in 1958 at the massachusetts institute of 
technology when freshman fraternity pledges were ordered to measure 
the length of harvard bridge using only chalk and the body of one 
oliver reed smoot jr the pranksters manhandled their fellow pledge 
endtoend like a ruler to measure the bridge 
the bridge markings maintained by lambda chi alpha pledges for 
30 years threatened to become extinct when the 1891 bridge 
recently was slated for a 165 million reconstruction 
however the metropolitan district commission and the department 
of public works decided the smoot should stay when the sidewalk was 
replaced 
as a result of the smoot withstanding the test of time it has 
become part of the folklore of the harvard bridge and as such is 
now under the protection of the mdc declared the agencys chief 
bridge engineer david lenhardt at a resmooting ceremony sunday 
on the night of the fraternity prank the bridge was found to be 
3644 smoots plus one ear 
out of the 14 pledges i had the distinction of being the 
shortest explained smoot who is 5 feet 7 inches 
and had the best name said peter s miller who was in 
charge of the chalk on that fateful night 
twice a year since freshman pledges have faithfully 
resmooted the bridge that links mit with boston marking each 
10smoot length with a gash of paint on the sidewalk 
the bridges new sidewalk is scored at 5foot 7inch intervals 
instead of the usual 6 feet which will make it easier for future 
pledges to repaint their smoot marks said charles madden senior 
vice president for martin continental construction co the 
contractor rebuilding the bridge 
smoot now an executive with a trade group in washington dc 
lay down to have miller chalk his measure on the new sidewalk 
although the original deed was done in the dark of night 
interrupted once by a patrolling police car that sent the pledges 
scurrying into the shrubs the resmooting was punctuated with 
flash bulbs and applause 
smoot and his son stephen mit class of 90 also posed in front 
of a bronze plaque that was donated by smoots class of 62 at 
their 25th class reunion 
it reads this plaque placed in honor of the smoot which 
joined the angstrom meter and light year as standards of length 
when in october 1958 the span of this bridge was measured using 
the body of oliver reed smoot mit 62 and found to be precisely 
3644 smoots and one ear 
reflecting back on the obscure act that has made him a local 
legend smoot concluded we did it under orders and we didnt 
enjoy it then but we sure as hell enjoy it now

the supreme court today refused to review the 
case of an illinois bookstore owner found guilty of contempt for 
violating a law later judged to be unconstitutional 
the justices without comment let stand the contempt finding 
against sequoia books inc in connection with its operation of the 
denmark bookstore near aurora ill 
the bookstore which sells sexually explicit material 
previously had been convicted of selling obscene material when in 
1987 it was found to be a public nuisance under state law 
a state judge issued an order permanently barring the bookstore 
from maintaining the public nuisance by exhibiting selling or 
offering for sale material in the premises that would violate the 
law 
sequoia books inc challenged the permanent injunction as an 
impermissible prior restraint of free speech while the appeal 
was pending prosecutors sought to have the bookstore closed down 
on grounds that it again was selling obscene materials 
the sale of two magazines leather sleaze and hard 
leather was cited by the prosecutors who contended that the 
magazines were obscene 
sexually explicit material while often characterized as 
pornography is not necessarily obscene obscenity a legal term 
must be determined in a judicial proceeding 
if sexually explicit material is obscene it enjoys no 
freespeech protection if it is not obscene it is protected by 
the freespeech guarantees in the constitutions first amendment 
a state court jury in mid1987 found that the two magazines were 
obscene and that the denmark bookstore therefore had violated the 
court order barring it from violating the states public nuisance 
law 
sequoia books inc was found guilty of criminal contempt of 
court and was fined 10000 
on jan 19 1988 a state appeals court ruled for sequoia books 
in its earlier appeal of the permanent injunction the appeals 
court said the state criminal public nuisance law when applied to 
the bookstore was an invalid prior restraint on free speech 
state prosecutors appealed that ruling to the illinois supreme 
court and that appeal is pending 
meanwhile the denmark bookstore again was found in contempt of 
the judges order barring violation of public nuisance law the 
bookstore was padlocked for a period of time 
last july 21 the same appeals court that invalidated the state 
public nuisance laws application to the bookstore upheld the 
contempt citations stemming from violations of that law 
the appeals court rejected sequoia books argument that a 
judgment of contempt cannot stand when based on an unconstitutional 
injunction 
the appeals court said the judges order barring the bookstore 
from violating the nuisance law was not transparently invalid 
when issued and therefore could support a contempt finding 
the state supreme court refused to review the contempt issue 
but postponed the appeals court rulings effect a 20000 fine 
and possibly another padlocking to allow sequoia books a chance 
to seek help from the nations highest court 
the case is sequoia books vs illinois 881342

here is a transcript of president bushs 
announcement monday of sanctions against the chinese government and 
his questionandanswer session with reporters afterward 
well during the past few days elements of the chinese army 
have been brutally suppressing popular and peaceful demonstrations 
in china theres been widespread and continuing violence many 
casualties and many deaths 
and we deplore the decision to use force and i now call on the 
chinese leadership publicly as i have in private channels to 
avoid violence and to return to their previous policy of restraint 
the demonstrators in tiananmen square were advocating basic 
human rights including the freedom of expression freedom of the 
press freedom of association these are goals we support around 
the world 
these are freedoms that are enshrined in both the us 
constitution and the chinese constitution throughout the world we 
stand with those who seek greater freedom and democracy this is 
the strongly felt view of my administration of our congress and 
most important of the american people 
in recent weeks weve urged mutual restraint nonviolence and 
dialogue instead there has been a violent and bloody attack on 
the demonstrators the united states cannot condone the violent 
attacks and cannot ignore the consequences for our relationship 
with china which has been built on a foundation of broad support 
by the american people 
this is not the time for an emotional response but for a 
reasoned careful action that takes into account both our 
longterm interests and recognition of a complex internal situation 
in china 
there clearly is turmoil within the ranks of the political 
leadership as well as the political the peoples liberation 
army and now is the time to look beyond the moment to important 
and enduring aspects of this vital relationship for the united 
states indeed the budding of democracy which we have seen in 
recent weeks owes much to the relationship we have developed since 
1972 
and its important at this time to act in a way that will 
encourage the further development and deepening of the positive 
elements of that relationship and the process of democratization 
it would be a tragedy for all if china were to pull back to its 
pre1972 era of isolation and repression 
mindful of these complexities and yet of the necessity to 
strongly and clearly express our condemnation of the events of 
recent days im ordering the following actions 
suspension of all governmenttogovernment sales and commercial 
exports of weapons 
suspension of visits between us and chinese military leaders 
sympathic review of requests by chinese students in the united 
states to extend their stay 
and the offer of humanitarian and medical assistance through 
the red cross to those injured during the assault 
and review of other aspects of our bilateral relationship as 
events in china continue to unfold 
the process of democratization of communist societies will not 
be a smooth one and we must react to setbacks in a way which 
stimulates rather than stifles progress toward open and 
representative systems 
and id be glad to take a few questions before our cabinet 
meeting which starts in a few minutes i think i cant remember 
whos first here tom 
q yes mr president you have said 
bush and then helen 
q you have said the genie of democracy cannot be put back in 
the bottle in china you said that however before the actions of 
the past weekend do you still believe that and are there further 
steps that the united states could take such as economic 
sanctions to further democracy in china 
bush yes i still believe that i believe the forces of 
democracy are so powerful and when you see them as recently as 
this morning a single student standing in front of a tank and 
then i might add seeing the tank driver exercise restraint im 
convinced that the forces of democracy are going to overcome these 
unfortunate events in tiananmen square 
on the commercial side i dont want to hurt the chinese people 
i happen to believe that commercial contacts have led in essence 
to this quest for more freedom i think as people have commercial 
incentive whether its in china or in other totalitarian systems 
the move to democracy becomes more inexorable 
so what we have done is suspended certain things on the military 
side and my concern is with those in the military who are using 
force and yet when i some exercising restraint and see the big 
divisions that exist inside the pla i am i think we need to move 
along the lines ive outlined here 
i think that its important to keep saying to those elements in 
the chinese military restraint continue to show the restraint 
that many of you have shown and i understand there are deep 
divisions inside the army so this is were putting the emphasis 
on that side of it 
yes helen

three civilians today 
in washington president bush condemned chinese authorities for 
the bloody and violent crackdown he said he was ordering a 
suspension of american military sales and commerical export of 
weapons to china 
one chinese military source said soldiers fought each other 
around the nanyuan military air base on the southern outsksirts of 
the city today he said the fighting was serious 
but residents living near the restricted base said they had seen 
a steady stream of planes landing and taking off but had not seen 
or heard fighting 
artillery shelling also was heard in a far northwestern suburb

diplomat said its more than that there is solid evidence he 
would not elaborate

split over the governments may 20 decision to declare martial law 
and send troops to beijing the 38th army based around beijing 
reportedly refused to advance on the city 
the source said the 38th was ordered to take over from the 27th 
army which is responsible for the carnage over the weekend it is 
not clear whether the army is obeying the order 
although there have been no accurate tallies more than 1000 
people are widely believed to have been killed and thousands 
injured since the army moved to retake tiananmen square from 
studentled protesters 
philippine vice consul corazon patarata told a manila radio 
station from beijing today that the diplomatic community estimates 
3000 protesters have been killed by the army 
protests against the crackdown were reported in several 
provincial cities as the government praised the military attacks as 
a patriotic effort to put down rioters trying to overthrow the 
communist system 
a chinese journalist said one mans body was ripped apart with 
machine gunfire from his chin to his stomach this morning and three 
others were shot and wounded when 17 truckloads of troops attacked 
a crowd at a major intersection west of tiananmen square 
chinese witnesses said a girl was shot in the chest around noon 
when troops charged up a narrow residential street near the square 
two more people died in gunfire from troops who rushed up a 
central beijing street in the late afternoon other chinese 
witnesses said 
a us embassy official also said soldiers fired 
indiscriminately from 50 to 100 military trucks that hurtled down a 
normally quiet street flanked by a park and foreign embassies in

complex for diplomats 
the american and other embassies began sheltering foreign 
students studying at chinese universities 
tank and troop convoys moved throughout the night and day and 
helicopters dropped off supplies at tiananmen square for the 
thousands of soldiers occupying the area since they drove out 
protesters early sunday 
burnedout hulls of buses and military vehicles littered 
streets which protesters by the thousands refused to quit public 
transportation was at a standstill and most downtown shops closed 
no chinese leader has come forth to take responsibility for the 
decision to turn the military on civilians filling hospitals with 
the dead and dying and it was not known how much opposition to the 
move exists in the government 
chinese sources said senior leader deng xiaoping 84 ordered 
the attack to halt seven weeks of student protests for a freer 
china and an end to official corruption they said deng was in a 
military hospital being treated for prostate cancer 
premier li peng who ordered martial law in beijing has not 
appeared in public or commented on the violence he and old guard 
ideologues many in their 80s are believed to support the action 
the massacre has discredited the government army and communist 
party and many enraged citizens are calling for revolution 
before the massive weekend attack hundreds of thousands of 
people had thwarted troop movements into the city 
in eastern beijing soldiers let off several bursts of automatic 
rifle fire today as seven military trucks moved on an intersection 
where crowds had set several army vehicles ablaze

today blocked intersections and in the southern provincial capital 
of changsha sources said they said thousands of students in the 
northeastern cities of shenyang and changchun marched sunday in

morning when a man wearing a white shirt ran in front of a tank 
column and momentarily brought it to a halt the man climbed on the 
lead tank got down and again moved to block its way when the tank 
tried to drive around him finally five or six people rushed from 
the crowd at the side and dragged him to safety 
hundreds of people fled in panic when the column of 21 tanks and 
armored personnel carriers pulled out of the square and headed 
eastward many rode bicycles in front of the convoy some

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
connecticut law that protected hunters against harassment and 
interference 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that the 1985 state law was so broad and vague that it 
violated freespeech rights 
francelle dorman of niantic conn was arrested jan 30 1986 
and charged with violating the law 
her arrest occured during goosehunting season on state forest 
property located near her home 
ms dorman described in court documents as someone opposed to 
the hunting and killing of animals had approached several hunters 
in marshlands and tried to dissuade them from hunting any waterfowl 
according to the court documents ms dorman walked with the 
hunters spoke to them about the violence and cruelty of 
hunting of the beauty of the waterfowl and of their right to 
live peacefully and without harm 
when ms dorman refused to leave the hunters summoned a law 
enforcement officer who arrested her 
the criminal charges against her violation of the states 
hunter harassment act was a misdemeanor later were dropped when 
prosecutors concluded that her arrest had been premature they said 
ms dorman only talked about what she was going to do to interfere 
with hunting for geese 
but ms dorman nevertheless sued in federal court three months 
after her arrest seeking to have the law struck down she 
contended that her arrest and the threat of future enforcement of 
the 1985 law violated her freespeech rights 
a federal judge agreed and struck down the law as too vague and 
overbroad 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling last 
dec 7 after turning down a request by prosecutors that the 
connecticut supreme court be given a chance to interpet exactly 
what forms of harassment and interference would be prohibited 
the connecticut court would be in no better position than a 
federal court to decide which interpretation is correct the 2nd 
circuit court said because the law is so imprecise and 
indefinite it is subject to any number of interpretations 
the law made it a crime for anyone to interfere with the 
lawful taking of wildlife by another person or to harass 
another person who is engaged in the lawful taking of wildlife or 
acts in preparation for such taking 
the appeals court said the terms interfere harass and 
acts in preparation can mean anything 
the offices of the connecticut attorney general and the chief 
states attorney then sought help from the nations highest court 
the case is satti vs dorman 881743

in washington the applause never lasts for 
long 
president bush fresh from his triumphant debut on the stage of 
international foreign policy at the nato summit has come home to 
face the twin challenges posed by the violence in china and the 
shifting balance of power in tehran 
the gusto bush showed in forging a compromise among the 
irascible north atlantic treaty organization allies has been 
replaced with cautious steps in response to the bloody repression 
of students in china 
early today bush announced he was halting us weapons sales to 
china and offering humantarian aid through the international red 
cross to those injured in the supression of demonstrations in china 
over the weekend 
my conviction is that this is not a time for anything other 
than a prudent reasoned responsethis is not the time for an 
emotional response bush said in explaining to reporters in the 
white house briefing room why he was not taking stronger action 
i dont want to see a total break in this relationship and i will 
not encourage a total break in this relationship 
bush who ran for the presidency touting his foreign policy 
expertise was buffeted by members of his own party who demanded a 
tough retaliatory response to the chinese brutalities 
its folly sniffed sen jesse helms rnc we need to 
stand with these young people who are trying to achieve freedom 
somehow it seemed so much easier when bush dealt with the nato 
leaders in brussels last week with them he shared a common 
celebration of their democratic values and the 40th anniversary of 
their pact against fascism 
there americas new president grabbed the international stage 
with his sweeping proposals for cuts in conventional weapons and 
the compromise on shortrange nuclear weapons 
but in iran in the wake of the khomeinis rule bush must deal 
with a nation that deeply embarrassed his oval office predecessors 
and stymied us foreign policy as it held americans hostage 
and chinas explosion of violence over the weekend provided a 
stark display of the difficulty a major superpower faces in 
attempting to influence another foreign nation 
for weeks the united states had appealed for calm and respect 
for the expressions of democracy in china 
secretary of state james a baker iii repeated those admonitions 
yet again on saturday even as the bullets began to fly in 
tiananmen square 
after hearing a live report of the massacre from a reporter on 
the scene with the sounds of ambulances echoing in the background 
bakers statements took a sharper tone he called the situation 
extremely deplorable and said the developments would arouse the 
concern of the us government and people 
later the white house issued a statement in bushs name saying 
he deeply deplored the decision to use force against peaceful 
demonstrators and the consequent loss of life 
he urged beijing to use nonviolent tactics expressing the hope 
that china will rapidly return to the path of political and 
economic reform and conditions of stability so that this 
relationship between the united states and china so important to 
both our peoples can continue its growth 
during bushs trip to china earlier this year he was hailed as 
an old friend of the country where hed served as one of the 
first us envoys to the peoples republic 
if bushs actions were not as vigorous as some might like he 
promised to monitor the situation and take further steps if 
necessary 
it reserve the right to take a whole new look at things if the 
violence escalates bush said today 
but now he treads cautiously because a lot is at stake 
does the united states turn on the 10year relationship that has 
blossomed since formal ties were reached in 1979 do the friendly 
relations thousands of student exchanges the 137 billion 
twoway trade now wither and die 
if bush chooses several actions are possible 
he could recall us ambassador james lilley for consultations 
to show disapproval he could suspend the transfer of 
hightechnology items or revoke the recently renewed 
mostfavorednation trading status that has helped china become the 
united states 13th largest trading partner 
currently us firms have been investing in china to the tune 
of 3 billion annually 
he also could break relations with beijing an unlikely 
possibility 
it is questionable what effect sanctions would have 
rep stephen solarz dny acknowledged on sunday that the 
us ability to influence the course of events in china is very 
limited 
but solarz who appeared with helms on cbstvs face the 
nation said he believed that much more is at stake what 
is involved is our capacity to credibly maintain our leadership 
of the movement for democracy and human rights around the world 
and if we appear to be indifferent or insensitive to the human 
rights of onefifth of the human race then i think itll be very 
difficult for us to plausibly contend that we are in favor of 
democracy and human rights all over the world

the supreme court today refused to postpone a 
pennsylvania death row inmates execution but in a strange twist 
of events a lower federal court already had granted a postponement 
the justices by a 54 vote denied an emergency request filed 
on behalf of roderick frey whose june 13 execution was to make him 
the first to die in pennsylvanias electric chair since 1962 
but a federal judge acting on a separate emergency request 
granted an indefinite stay of execution last week 
the supreme court request had been filed before the federal 
judge acted 
frey 52 was convicted of arranging the nov 8 1979 killing of 
his wife barbara jean she was fatally shot while driving to work 
in lancaster county 
frey confessed to hiring charles zehring for the murder the 
couples divorce was pending at the time 
the nations highest court already has agreed to review the 
constitutionality of pennsylvanias death penalty law a decision 
is expected during the court term that will begin next october 
a stillpending formal appeal filed on freys behalf raises the 
issue the court already is studying whether the state law 
improperly limits the discretion of juries in choosing life or 
death for convicted killers 
under pennsylvanias law a jury must impose the death penalty 
if it unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance 
and no mitigating circumstance 
the justices are being urged to rule that the state law results 
in impermissible mandatory death sentences 
the pennsylvania supreme court rejected that argument last 
october when it upheld the death penalty law 
state officials contend the state law is constitutional because 
despite its mandatory language nothing prevents a defendant from 
presenting any and all mitigating evidence to offset any 
aggravating circumstance 
dissenting from todays onesentence order denying freys 
emergency request were justices william j brennan thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
the case is frey vs pennsylvania a914

q have you had personal contact with the chinese leadership 
why do you think they moved in the way they did and why did you 
wait so long 
bush well i dont think weve waited so long helen weve 
been i made very clear in a personal communication to deng 
xiaoping my views on this i talked to the ambassador last night 
jim lilley weve been in hes been in touch constantly with the 
chinese officials and so i cant i dont feel that weve waited 
long when you have a force of this nature and you have events of 
this nature unfolding 
we are the united states and they are china and what i want to 
do is continue to urge freedom democracy respect nonviolence 
and with great admiration in my heart for the students so i dont 
think weve waited long what was the other part of your question 
q what impelled the chinese government they did wait a long 
time more than we expected really and 
bush yes they did 
q then they finally moved in what do you think is the 
bush we were urging thats a im glad you raised that 
point we were and have been and will continue to urge restraint 
and they did the army did show restraint when wan li was here 
he told me and this is very chinese the way he expressed it the 
army loves the chinese people 
and they showed restraint for a long time and i dont i cant 
begin to fathom for you exactly what led to the order to use force 
because even as recently as a couple of days ago there was 
evidence that the military were under orders not to use force so 
i think we have to wait now until that unfolds yeah brit 
q mr president could you give us your current best 
assessment of the political situation there which leaders are up 
which are down who apparently has prevailed here and who 
apparently has lost 
bush its too obscure its too beclouded to say and i would 
remind you of this history in the cultural revolution days deng 
xiaoping at mao zedongs right hand was put out he came back in 
1976 he was put out again in the last days of mao zedong and the 
days of the gang of four 
then he came back in and to his credit he moved china towards 
openness towards democracy towards reform and suddenly we see a 
reversal and i dont think there is anybody in this country that 
can answer your question with authority at this point it doesnt 
work that way in dealing with china 
q mr president there have been reports that deng was behind 
the move to order the troops and other reports that hes ailing 
and in a hospital what do you know about that sir 
bush no dont know for sure on either and ive talked to our 
ambassador on that as i say last night and we just cant 
confirm one way or another on the other yes 
q mr president you spoke of the need for the us to maintain 
relations with china but given the brutality of the attacks over 
the last couple of days can the us ever return to business as 
usual with the current regime 
bush i dont want to see a total break in this relationship 
and i will not encourage a total break in the relationship 
this relationship is when you see these kids struggling for 
democracy and freedom this would be a bad time for the united 
states to withdraw and pull back and leave them to the devices of a 
leadership that might decide to crack down further 
i do some have suggested i take the ambassador out in my 
view that would be 180 degrees wrong our ambassador provides one 
of the best listening posts we have in china he is thoroughly 
experienced and so let others make proposals that in my view dont 
make much sense 
i want to see us stay involved and continue to work for 
restraint and for human rights and for democracy and then down the 
road we have enormous commonality of interest with china but it 
will not be the same under a brutal and repressive regime so i 
stop short of suggesting that what we ought to do is break 
relations with china and i would like to encourage them to 
continue their change yes 
q mr bush youre sending a message to the military and to the 
government a couple of weeks ago you told the students to continue 
to stand by their beliefs what message do you want the students to 
hear from what youre saying right now 
bush that we support their quest for democracy for reform and 
for freedom and there should be no doubt about that and then in 
sending this message to the military i would encourage them to go 
back to the posture of a few days ago that did show restraint and 
that did recognize the rights of the people and that did epitomize 
what that chinese leader told me that the army loves the people 
theres still vivid examples of that 
q should the students go home should the students stop trying 
to 
bush i cant dictate to the students what they should do from 
half way around the world but we support the quest for democracy 
and reform that this relationship is vital to the united states of 
america and so is our adherence to democracy and our encouragement 
for those who are willing to hold high the banner of democracy so 
weve found i think a prudent path here 
yes

an unusual nonbinding trial is intended to 
help settle a 300 million lawsuit brought by the neighbors of a 
government uraniumprocessing plant in a case that might otherwise 
take weeks in court 
us district judge s arthur spiegel is presiding over the 
summary trial to encourage an agreement in the classaction 
suit representing about 14000 people who live within five miles of 
the feed materials production center in fernald ohio 
eight jurors were selected for the trial this morning and the 
court was briefly recessed before opening arguments were to begin 
the trial was expected to last about a week with final arguments 
set to begin next monday 
the residents charge that the plant owned by the energy 
department and operated from 1951 to 1985 by national lead of ohio 
inc contaminated the air water and soil with uranium radium and 
thorium as well as dangerous nonradioactive substances including 
asbestos chlorids and barium 
the plant processed uranium for use in the governments nuclear 
weapons national lead and its parent firm national lead 
industries are named in the suit residents claim the plant 18 
miles northwest of cincinnati caused them emotional stress and 
lowered property values 
the energy department denies the allegations but has begun a 
cleanup program and admitted that more than 300000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium oxide dust escaped into the atmosphere through 
faulty airfiltering systems 
cincinnati lawyer stanley m chesley representing the 
plaintiffs said he considers the summary trial a useful tool for 
encouraging a settlement which chesley said the energy department 
had been unwilling to negotiate 
were finally going to hear the story of fernald were 
finally going to have it in a court of law chesley said we 
think its a wonderful opportunity to resolve a dispute 
energy department lawyer henry a gill jr declined to say 
whether the department would be willing to settle the case 
the energy department contends that the companies are innocent 
because they were contractors following the governments orders 
the department has conceded it told national lead to emphasize 
production even if that meant ignoring some environmental 
regulations 
gill said he would not regard the verdict of the summary trial 
as final 
absolutely not its by its very nature a nonbinding 
verdict its a settlement tool that some judges like to avoid 
using gill said 
but chesley said its not binding but in my estimation it 
becomes very significant i think this is the utmost conflict 
resolution method that we know about

an evenly divided supreme court today upheld a 
texas death row inmates murder conviction and death sentence but 
left unresolved a key question on racial bias in criminal trials 
by a 44 vote the justices automatically upheld the conviction 
and sentence of philip tompkins who in 1981 killed mary d berry 
in houston 
the split vote was accompanied only by a twosentence unsigned 
opinion that upheld texas court rulings and said justice sandra day 
oconnor did not participate in the case 
it is not known how the other eight justices are split but the 
court is likely to search out another case offering the same 
question how difficult should it be for prosecutors to prove they 
did not exclude potential jurors because of their race 
if the high courts eight other votes remain constant in some 
future case oconnors vote will control the outcome 
lower federal courts and state courts have been confused in 
trying to implement a 1986 supreme court decision in which the 
justices banned prosecutors from taking race into account when 
picking jurors 
the 1986 ruling curtailed dramatically the traditionally broad 
power of prosecutors to strike prospective jurors from trials by 
using peremptory or automatic challenges 
the justices said the exclusion of potential jurors from any 
criminal trial because of their race violates the equalprotection 
rights of defendants and of those people excluded 
in the case acted on today a texas trial judge ruled that 
tompkins had made a preliminary showing of discrimination in the 
prosecutions use of peremptory challenges 
during jury selection the prosecutor struck all 13 potential 
black jurors as a result the jury that convicted tompkins who is 
black was composed totally of whites 
but the trial judge ruled that the prosecutor in tompkins case 
successfully explained her peremptory challenges as neutral 
relative clear and legitimate and not racially motivated 
a state appeals court upheld tompkins conviction and death 
sentence but noted that arguments by his lawyers cast 
considerable doubt upon the neutral explanations offered by counsel 
for the state 
lower courts have disagreed over just how stringently they 
should evaluate a prosecutors explanation of allegedly racially 
motivated exclusions of potential jurors 
the case is tompkins vs texas 876405

as many as 800 people may have died when gas 
leaking from a pipeline filled a mountain valley exploded and 
engulfed two passing trains in flames a newspaper editor in the 
area said today 
in the first precise official report tass said its preliminary 
count showed 400 of the more than 1200 people aboard the passenger 
trains including many children bound for summer camp were dead or 
missing after sundays explosion in the ural mountains along the 
transsiberian railroad 
military units are searching the adjacent forest and mountains 
in the hope that some of the passengers managed to escape the 
tornado of fire the official news agency said 
the blast was equivalent to the explosion of 10000 tons of tnt 
gen mikhail moiseyev the soviet military chief of staff told 
tass 
president mikhail s gorbachev who visited the remote site 
sunday told the new soviet parliament a few hundred people had 
been killed he said incompetence and a lack of discipline might 
have contributed to the accident 
gennady k dmitrin editor of evening chelyabinsk said his 
newspaper has a list of between 500 and 800 people dead he said 
that list was preliminary 
dmitrin said children under age 8 did not have train tickets and 
therefore were not included in the count tass gave for the number 
of people aboard 
asked about the death toll given by dmitrin dr vladimir 
ruchki a local health ministry spokesman said its about 
right he said more than 600 people were hospitalized tass said 
more than 500 people were hospitalized and that 85 percent suffered 
severe burns 
moiseyev told tass the liquefied gas explosion had the same 
yield as a 10000ton bomb and was so powerful that it felled all 
trees within 25 miles he said the blast hurled two locomotives 
and 38 passengers cars from the rails with most of the cars 
destroyed by a onemilelong blaze the total number of railroad 
cars was not known 
the picture i saw was terrifying catastrophic dmitrin 
said reading from a correspondents firstperson account published 
in his paper the forest was practically burned to ashes by the 
fire only blackened trunks of trees could be seen but most 
tragic cars were blackened twisted and even now exude a 
suffocating stink 
a special aeroflot flight brought 50 of the injured to moscow 
for medical care today the wounded their skin blistered and 
peeling in places were loaded on stretchers into waiting 
ambulances 
in moscow speaking to congress gorbachev called for a minute 
of silence and the 2250 deputies stood to mourn the victims 
gorbachev then recessed the session for a national day of mourning 
the 58yearold soviet leader in remarks from the kremlins 
palace of congresses broadcast live on radio and television said 
the 1153 milelong pipeline burst a half mile from the rails 
he said the liquefied petroleum gas poured down a slope toward 
the tracks for three hours despite the leak pumps were turned on 
to compensate for the pressure loss 
everything started to accumulate and when this mass reached 
the level of electrical train contacts a spark ignited this 
condensed cloud gorbachev told the deputies 
the two passenger trains traveling in opposite directions 
had made unscheduled stops near each other between the city of ufa 
and the town of asha 750 miles southeast of moscow one train was 
on a siding and the other was on the main tracks the soviet 
president indicated 
how could it be that again there is incompetence 
irresponsibility mismanagement disgrace comrades and i and all 
residents there said there will be no progress if we have such 
laxness gorbachev said 
he said investigators would examine why the gas pump was turned 
on despite the leak and why the two trains made unscheduled stops 
at the same place 
the busy railroad links the western european part of the 
country to the asian region in the east the trains were traveling 
between novosibirsk the largest town in siberia with a population 
of 13 million and adler a popular black sea resort 
gorbachev said among the victims was a group of children 
traveling to southern resorts tass said 16 severely burned 
children were taken to the town of yuryuzan and that doctors are 
struggling to save their lives 
the whole territory blew up it was a real hell gorbachev 
said sunday in chelyabinsk the biggest city near the scene 
television carried his remarks in a special latenight broadcast 
sunday 
the television showed bloody and blackened faces and limbs of 
victims one boy lying on a stretcher in an ambulance at the 
chelyabinsk airport was so scarred the correspondent had to tell 
viewers hes living 
the film showed charred railroad cars without windows lying at 
odd angles amid twisted tracks and protruding railroad ties the 
surrounding area was blackened and barren 
the blast was so strong it shattered windows in a village seven 
miles away and incinerated dozens of acres of trees television 
said 
it was the third major soviet train accident in a year and added 
to the disasters during gorbachevs 4yearold rule they include 
the chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion the sinking of a 
cruise ship and a nucleararmed submarine and the armenian 
earthquake 
sundays accident was the worst in the soviet union since june 
4 1988 when nearly 100 people were killed as three trains loaded 
with industrial explosives blew up in arzamas 240 miles east of 
moscow 
in the most recent fatal train accident a freight train carrying 
propane collided with another freight on may 20 in soviet 
kazakhstan causing a fire and eplosion that killed five people and 
destroyed factories and 13 houses

q do you think that the events in china can have a chilling 
effect on democratic reforms occurring in other communist 
countries particularly in the soviet union and eastern europe 
when they look at the kind of uprising that is sparked in china 
bush no i think the moves that were seeing in eastern europe 
today and indeed in the soviet union are going to go forward 
and i think people are watching more with horror and saying 
how given this movement towards democracy can the chinese 
leadership react in the way they have 
and so i think its i think i think this may be a sign to 
others around the world that people are are heroic when it comes 
to their commitment to democratic change and i would just urge the 
chinese leaders to recognize that 
last row here were going across and thats it yes dave 
q mr president there are reports that the chinese military is 
badly divided and that for this crackdown the authorities 
brought in some troops from the tibet conflict if thats the case 
how does suspending our these military relationships encourage 
any kind of change i mean could you explain what the point of 
doing that is 
bush i already did david you missed it i explained it 
because i want to keep it on the military side i have expressed 
here rhetorically the indignation we feel i have recognized the 
history of china moving into its own middle kingdom syndrome as 
its done in various times in its past 
and i want to encourage the things that have helped the chinese 
people and i think now the suspension is going to send a strong 
signal im not saying its going to cure the shortrange problem 
in china im not sure any outside country can cure the 
shortrange the today in tiananmen square problem 
but i think it is very important that the chinese leaders know 
its not going to be business as usual and i think its important 
that the army know that we want to see restraint and this is the 
best way to signal that any others in there yes 
q mr bush do you fear conflict you talked about the 
divisions within the chinese army do you or your advisors fear 
that there could actually be a civil conflict between army 
commanders 
bush well i dont want to speculate on that but there are 
differences clearly within the army in terms of use of force 
otherwise they wouldnt be doing what david hoffman properly 
pointed out is happening units coming in from outside 
and it is not incidentally just in tiananmen square that the 
chinese that this problem exists it is in shanghai its in 
chengdu today its in guangzhou i am told in a much smaller 
scale 
but they brought the troops in from outside because the beijing 
troops apparently demonstrated a great sensitivity to the cause of 
the young people and were disciplined though they were they 
opted for the side of democracy and change in the young people 
so those others came in but i certainly dont want to speculate 
on something that i dont have i cant reach that conclusion put 
it that way 
q there were some news reports that some of the soldiers units 
had burned their own trucks have you received the same type of 
intelligence reports 
bush i think i just saw a speculation i havent got it on 
any i dont believe the intelligence said that but there are 
reports that it is very difficult for some of these for some of 
the military who are much more sympathetic to the openness to the 
demonstrators 
and i again go back to the original question here that tom 
asked i think with the change thats taken place so far were 
beyond kind of a cultural revolution response i think it i think 
the depth of the feeling towards democracy is so great that you 
cant put the genie back in the bottle and return to total 
repression and i think what were seeing is the manifestation of 
that in the divisions within the pla 
but i i certainly want to stop short of predicting a civil war 
between units of the peoples liberation army thank you all very 
much 
q how about poland 
bush i have a cabinet meeting at 1000 
q what about poland what did you think of the elections 
bush i think they were very interesting we dont havent 
seen the final results but communist bureaucrats beware in poland 
it looks to me like theres quite a move moving towards this 
freedom and democracy

the supreme court in a victory for artists 
and authors said today a homelessrights group does not own 
exclusively the copyright to a sculpture it commissioned an artist 
to create 
the 90 decision ordered further lower court hearings to 
determine whether the community for creative nonviolence ccnv 
and its founder mitch snyder may share in the copyright of a work 
entitled third world america that depicts the plight of the 
homeless 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said the 
sculpture is a work made for hire and therefore its creator 
james earl reid of baltimore must at least share in the copyright 
marshall said ccnv did not become the copyright owner just 
because it played an active role in designing the work and may 
control its display reid is a freelance artist not an employee 
of ccnv he said 
transforming a commissioned work into a work by an employee on 
the basis of the hiring partys right to control the work is 
inconsistent with the workforhire provisions of a 1976 
federal copyright law marshall said 
ccnv based in the nations capital decided in 1985 to 
participate in the annual christmas pageant of peace here by having 
reid help create a display dramatizing the plight of the homeless 
reid using a synthetic substance tinted to resemble bronze 
scuplted two adult figures and a child huddled on a streetside 
steam grate 
the lifesized figures were intended as part of an updated 
nativity scene 
ccnv provided a steam grate and pedestal for the work 
reid was paid 15000 for expenses and for his assistants he 
donated his own services without charge 
ccnv sent the entire sculpture back to reid in january 1986 for 
some repairs 
the group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of several 
cities to raise money for the homeless 
but reid objected to the tour because he said the sculpture 
was too fragile he urged ccnv to cast the work in bronze or make a 
master mold that would withstand the tour 
ccnv declined but said reid could do so if he wished 
two months later reid refused to return the sculpture and 
registered it in his own name he also said he planned to take the 
work on a less ambitious exhibition tour 
ccnv then filed a lawsuit claiming exclusive copyright ownership 
of the sculpture 
a federal judged ruled in favor of the organization but the 
us court of appeals here overturned the judges decision 
ordering further hearings in the dispute to determine whether ccnv 
is entitled to share in the copyright 
a group representing more than 100000 artists and authors urged 
the supreme court to uphold the appeals court decision 
the reputation and income of freelance artists depends on their 
ability to own the copyrights of their works the group said 
the case is community for creative nonviolence vs reid 88293

ignored and found strike coordinators marty hudson jackie stump 
and ca phillips in contempt of court about 1500 miners in 
virginia and west virginia have been on strike against pittston

a west german computer hacker 
suspected of providing the soviet kgb with code words to gain 
access to western research and defense computers apparently has 
committed suicide police said today 
the body of a man found burned to death thursday near the city 
of gifhorn about 25 miles east of hanover has been identified as 
that of karl koch police said koch 24 was under investigation 
for his part in a computer scandal that resulted in international 
headlines in march 
wolfsburg police said in a statement that koch apparently doused 
himself with gasoline and set himself on fire 
a melted plastic gasoline canister was found near the body 
and there were no signs of foul play from an outside source 
the statement said 
koch was one of eight west german computer hackers under 
investigation for allegedly supplying soviet agents with code words 
to gain access to western computers those computers included the 
us defense departments general databank known as optimus and a 
nasa star wars research computer 
authorities said at the time that the hackers were believed to 
have been recruited by the kgb the soviet intelligence agency in 
1985 and were paid in cash and drugs to provide the code words 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office in karlsruhe confirmed today that koch was one of the 
hackers under investigation 
we are still investigating the others and expect to file 
charges when the probe is completed foerster said 
officials have said that while the code words allegedly provided 
by the hackers gave the soviets access to various computer 
networks they were not sufficient to gain access to classified 
information

the death of rep claude pepper whose 
largerthanlife national status made his congressional seat 
untouchable has unleashed a frenzy of speculation and backroom 
politicking over his replacement 
florida republicans see an opportunity to bolster their new 
majority in the states congressional delegation by nominating and 
electing the first cubanamerican representative 
democrats have promised to campaign under the banner of pepper 
who had held the 18th district seat since its inception in 1962 
the date of the special election will be set after todays 
funeral for pepper who died tuesday at age 88 
its sort of like a chess game said mayor xavier suarez 
who was busy last week trying to broker his political influence 
with possible candidates in hopes of boosting his political capital 
the alliances are shifting by the hour suarez said in 
between phone calls its like an earthquake a hole opens up and 
then it gets filled in 
state gop chairman van poole and john buckley spokesman for the 
republican congressional campaign committee said the party 
believes it can win the seat which covers most of miami and miami 
beach and some suburban areas 
but dade county democratic chairman simon ferro said as far 
as we are concerned this is going to be the claude pepper memorial 
seat 
the republican party in florida is coming off its most 
successful election since reconstruction 
besides giving george bush his largest margin over michael 
dukakis of any state in the presidential election nearly 1 
million votes florida elected republican connie mack to replace 
retired democrat sen lawton chiles won two congressional seats 
from the democrats and took a 109 lead in the delegation when 
democratic rep bill grant switched parties 
florida is expected to gain at least three congressional seats 
after the 1990 census and democrats see the elections that year as 
a watershed 
were on edge here state rep mike abrams a democrat whose 
district includes north miami beach all the trend lines are 
wrong we need a win 
peppers district reflects the changes in florida politics 
when carved out for pepper who earlier had served 14 years in 
the senate it was filled with retirees from the northeat the 
percentage of voters calling themselves democrats has dropped in a 
decade from 72 percent to 54 percent a little less than 50 percent 
of residents are hispanic many of them cuban exiles solidly behind 
presidents reagan and bush 
pepper won every 1980s election by a landslide and drew no 
opposition last year he was a holdover new deal liberal who 
adopted a tough anticommunist viewpoint 
claude pepper transcended politics said miami beach mayor 
alex daoud he was just unique he was not a politician he 
was a statesman 
daoud coming off a lopsided reelection victory in 1987 is 
among the likely democratic candidates to replace pepper 
another is hialeah mayor raul martinez the cubanborn mayor of 
the 80 percent hispanic city since 1981 said he wouldnt comment on 
his plans until later this week 
other democratic speculation has focused upon state sen jack 
gordon who shares most of peppers constituency and liberalism 
but gordon 67 may be hamstrung because of his opposition to us 
aid to the nicaraguan contras whose cause is popular among local 
hispanics 
the republicans have several promising hispanic politicians to 
field 
state reps lincoln diazbalart and al gutman and state sen 
ileana roslehtinen are among those mentioned most 
roslehtinens husband us attorney dexter lehtinen a vietnam 
war hero and former state legislator had been considered a likely 
candidate but has said lately he is content in his current job

president ibrahim babangida on monday said 
he will not abandon his tough economic policies despite widespread 
rioting caused by price increases 
speaking at the opening of the armed forces consultive assembly 
in nigerias new capital babingida said there was no viable 
alternative to the new economic program 
austerity measures instituted recently by the military 
government were demanded by western creditors and have led to sharp 
price hikes for some basic goods and services 
those price increases touched off a violent student 
demonstration at a university in the midwestern city of benin on 
may 24 and rioting spread to most of nigeria last week 
a lagos newspaper punch reported sunday that 50 people had 
died nationwide in six days of clashes between police and

hungry seals and sea lions are dining on 
salmon off oregon and fish experts say residents are picking up the 
check 
harbor seals and california sea lions have flourished since the 
federal marine mammal protection act was adopted in 1972 but 
oregon fishemen say its time to control the population 
the oregon department of fish and wildlife estimates there are 
5000 to 7000 harbor seals in state waters double the population 
in the mid1970s biologists say the sea lion population has 
increased by onethird since 1972 
the seals and sea lions cruise the river estuaries for salmon 
returning from the ocean to spawn 
a seal eats about 25 pounds of fish a day wildlife 
biologist john johnson says if you multiply the number of seals 
in the bay times 365 days a year thats a staggering figure 
tom robinson manager of the oregon salmon commission says each 
10pound chinook represents 75 to oregons economy and each 
fivepound coho represents 35 
thats a fairly expensive meal he says

archaeologists planned to begin scouring 
parts of northern mississippi on tuesday in search of the 
16thcentury trail of spanish explorer hernando de soto and his 
expeditions 154041 winter campsite 
our ultimate goal is to find the campsite said university 
of mississippi archaeologist jay johnson who will lead the team 
and from that we could figure out a lot more about de sotos 
expedition including the spot where he crossed the tombigbee 
river 
some researchers think the crossing is between aberdeen and the 
site of the old nashville ferry an area that includes columbus 
the campsite was the scene of a march 1541 battle in which 
chickasaw indians destroyed much of the spaniards supply train and 
killed 49 men the indians called the place chicasa 
researchers requested the help of a nasa airplane equipped with 
infrared sensors in an effort to locate the campsite the sensors 
can detect heat differences between normal land and phosphate 
deposits that characterize inhabited sites 
but if were going to do aerial surveys we need to do them 
before september johnson said once crops start coming in 
its hard to see the ground and we want to cover as much ground as 
possible 
johnson spoke friday at the first meeting of the mississippi de 
soto commission at the columbus convention center the state 
commission is one of 10 in the southeast trying to pin down and 
mark the path of de sotos 15391542 explorations which included 
the first european sighting of the mississippi river 
we have the responsibility of erecting markers to signal the 
exploration and then planning events commemorating the 
expedition said elbert hilliard director of the state 
department of archives and history 
we want to promote scholarly archaeological and historical 
research that results in more information on this expedition and 
its impact on the history of our region he said 
the 34member commission is funded by private donations and 
includes a representative from all eight state colleges

michigan hopes to save millions of dollars 
with a new program designed to keep aids victims off the medicaid 
rolls by paying their private insurance premiums 
the twoyear pilot program given final legislative approval 
last week is already being discussed by other states and likely 
will be copied if it proves successful said state rep david 
hollister 
the program is aimed at someone who has a job has insurance 
and at some point they lose their job because of their illness 
said hollister who got the idea for the program while attending a 
workshop of the national academy of science on insurance companies 
and aids 
they can continue their insurance for up to 18 months at their 
own expense after they lose their job but most people dont have 
18 months of reserves to pay that he said so at a certain 
point theyre going to lose their insurance and at that point they 
become impoverished and we pay it out of medicaid 
the cost of treating a person with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome in michigan is about 1600 a month the state share of 
medicaid expenditures usually is about 45 percent or 724 
insurance premiums vary with different policies the average 
cost of a health plan offered to state employees is about 135 a 
month 
if an aids patient becomes too sick to work and continue paying 
insurance premiums medicaid could save about 1465 a month per 
person by paying the private insurance premium 
the state predicts about 180 people will participate in the 
program this year saving the state about 323000 370 in 1990 
saving 26 million and 580 in 1992 saving 41 million 
it is scheduled to start oct 1 as a threecounty experiment in 
the metropolitan detroit counties of wayne oakland and macomb 
which are home to about 70 percent of the states aidsinfected 
population 
the trickiest part is to make sure the state only pays the 
premiums for the people who would have become medicaid eligible 
said scott merwin a senior analyst with the department of social 
services medicaid division who wrote the proposal with hollister 
most people would become eligible for the program after they 
have lost their jobs and their disability insurance has expired 
critics say that the plan takes into account only participants 
incomes not assets and that the largest growing population of 
aids carriers intravenous drug users likely never had insurance 
at all 
robert lundy legislative officer for the michigan organization 
for human rights a homosexuallesbian group based in detroit said 
he was pleased with the program but didnt think it went far 
enough noting it only covered three counties 
the insurance industry which has the most to lose with the 
setup has responded mildly 
an inforce insurance policy is an inforce insurance policy 
if an aids patient borrows the money from uncle harry that policy 
is good said robert waldron director of the new york office of 
the health insurance association of america the trade association 
represents about 85 percent of the commercial health insurers in 
the country 
theyre obliged to pay thats the business theyre in in 
fact our advice has been hang on to that insurance policy beg 
borrow try not to steal but hang on to that insurance policy 
why should we complain waldron asked 
even blue cross and blue shield of michigan which has to take 
all comers regardless of illness backs the idea 
this seems to be a fairly restricted approach and its aimed 
at just those aids patients who have insurance already said 
dennis larson public relations coordinator for the company it 
doesnt lead me down the road to believe the states going to be 
recruiting aids patients to get on insurance 
as of may 8 1120 cases of aids had been reported in michigan 
since 1981 and 650 of those patients had died the centers for 
disease control in atlanta reported that as of april 30 there were 
90280 cases nationwide and 54402 of those people died 
aids weakens the bodys immune system and leaves it susceptible 
to cancers and infections it is transferred through the exchange 
of body fluids most often through sexual intercourse and sharing 
contaminated hypodermic needle or syringes

the supreme court today dealt a blow to 
minorities who say they are victims of onthejob discrimination 
making it easier for employers to refute claims of racial bias 
based on statistical evidence 
by a 54 vote the justices overturned a ruling that favored 
filipinos alaska natives and asians employed at alaska salmon 
canneries 
the justices ordered further lower court hearings in the case 
in a sharply worded dissent justice john paul stevens said the 
ruling retreats from 18 years of court decisions aimed at 
helping minorities who are victimized by discrimination that may be 
unintentional 
he said the court was turning a blind eye to the meaning and 
purpose of the principles underlying the federal civil rights act 
of 1964 outlawing workplace discrimination the changes the 
majority makes today tipping the scales in favor of employers are 
not faithful to those principles he said 
todays ruling said when minorities allege that statistics show 
they are victims of bias employers only have the burden of 
producing evidence that there is a legitimate reaon for apparently 
neutral business practices 
the burden of proving the practice is nondiscriminatory of 
persuading a jury there is no bias does not shift to the 
employer justice byron r white said for the court 
the plaintiff bears the burden of disproving an employers 
assertion that the adverse employment action or practice was based 
solely on a legitimate neutral consideration white said 
furthermore the court limited the statistical evidence that 
minorities can use to prove discrimination 
white said an absence of minority group members in skilled jobs 
is not evidence of bias if the absence reflects a dearth of 
qualified nonwhite applications for reasons that are not the 
employers fault 
also he continued the minority groups must show that any 
underrepresentation in a job category must be caused by specific 
business practices that are under attack 
white said that without such protection for employers their only 
recourse to eliminate racial imbalance intheir work forces would be 
unlawful quotas 
in other actions today the supreme court 
dealt a significant defeat to the church of scientology ruling 
in a 52 decision that contributions called fixed donations 
to the church by its members may not be claimed as federal income 
tax deductions 
the court upheld the internal revenue services contention that 
the donations are not charitable contributions and rejected 
arguments that denying tax deductions for the fixed donations 
violates the religious freedom of scientologists and creates an 
impermissible denominational preference 
upheld the murder conviction and death sentence of texas inmate 
philip tompkins but left unresolved in its 44 decision a key 
question on how difficult it should be for prosecutors to prove 
they did not exclude potential jurors because of their race 
tompkins who is black was convicted by an allwhite jury of 
the 1981 slaying of mary d berry in houston the prosecutor used 
peremptory challenges to reject all 13 prospective jurors who were 
black 
cleared the way for trial of a government lawsuit against junk 
bond specialist michael milken and removed a major obstacle to a 
650 million payment by his former employer to investors and the 
federal treasury 
the court without comment rejected milkens appeal to 
disqualify the federal judge presiding over the cases us 
district judge milton pollack in new york city milken and two 
codefendants contended that pollack has an apparent conflict of 
interest because his wife is receiving 30 million from the sale of 
a corporation in which milkens former employer drexel burnham 
lambert inc helped set up the financing 
left intact a 1986 federal law that generally prohibits 
medicare patients from using their own money to pay for an 
assistant surgeon in eye cataract operations 
a group of medicare patients in new york and california and eye 
doctors and their professional associations in the two states had 
contended that the law violates constitutional privacy and liberty 
protections 
ruled that a homelessrights group the community for creative 
nonviolence does not own exclusively the copyright to a sculpture 
it commissioned an artist to create 
the 90 decision a victory for artists and authors ordered 
further lower court hearings to determine whether ccnv and its 
founder mitch snyder may share in the copyright of a work by 
sculptor james earl reid of baltimore entitled third world 
america that depicts the plight of the homeless 
the bias case stems from discrimination charges against wards 
cove packing co inc of seattle wash and castle amp cooke inc of 
astoria ore 
the companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of alaska 
during the summer salmon run 
nonwhites say that while they hold nearly half the jobs at the 
canneries the jobs are racially stratified with whites dominating 
in higherpaying positions such as machinists carpenters and 
administrative slots 
the cannery companies said any racial divisions are caused by 
legitimate business reasons 
for example they said most higherpaying jobs require skill and 
prior experience that it is difficult for nonwhites to acquire 
because they are seasonal workers from remote regions of alaska 
the companies said statistics showing nonwhites holding most of 
the lowerpaying seasonal cannery worker jobs and fewer better 
positions do not prove discrimination 
the high court today agreed white said the proper comparison is 
between the racial composition of the skilled jobs and the racial 
composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor 
market 
the companies said the pacific northwest labor market that 
provides workers for the higherranking jobs is only 10 percent 
nonwhite the companies say they filled these more desirable jobs 
with more than 20 percent nonwhites 
joining white were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
joining stevens in dissent were justices william j brennan

two of irans bitterest foes iraq and israel today hoped for 
closer ties with the fundamentalist islamic state in their first 
official reaction to the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
president bush said theres a way for irans relationship 
with the united states to improve and thats for the release of the 
american hostages india proclaimed three days of mourning and 
the pope spoke of khomeinis impact on the world iranian exiles in 
the united states danced in the streets 
iraq is looking only for a comprehensive peace with iran based 
on strong relations the iraqi state daily althawra said 
referring to deadlocked peace negotiations since an aug 20 
ceasefire that ended their eightyear war but althawras 
commentary also called khomeini a grudgebearing tyrant and 
described iran as disunited and confused 
irans revolutionary patriarch died sunday after suffering a 
heart attack while recovering from stomach surgery he was 86 
israel said it wants postkhomeini iran to renew formerly 
friendly ties ruptured by the revolution government spokesman avi 
pazner said israel hopes for an ensuing future improvement in 
relations 
but foreign ministry spokesman allon liel called a little 
premature a newspaper report that israel is seeking a dialogue 
with the new regime 
the kuwait times echoed a hope expressed by many of irans arab 
neighbors that the new leadership will bring peace and guarantee 
permanent stability in the region 
in india prime minister rajiv gandhis government declared 
three days of state mourning canceling official entertainment and 
ordering flags flown at halfstaff may the iranian people and 
the bereaved family have courage and fortitude to bear this 
irreparable loss gandhi said in a message 
pope john paul ii speaking in helsinki said it is necessary 
to state with great respect and with deep reflection his impact on 
his country and a considerable part of the world 
governments of most persian gulf states sent polite cables of 
condolence to tehran but refrained from public comment on the death 
of the man many of them held responsible for a decade of regional 
instability 
oman was the only country among the sixnation gulf cooperation 
council to announce it is sending a delegation to the funeral 
tuesday 
the council groups oman with bahrain kuwait qatar saudi 
arabia and the united arab emirates the six countries directly in 
the firing line of khomeinis pledge to export his fundamentalist 
brand of islam 
saudi arabia the country with a particular grudge against 
khomeinis repeated attempts to politicize the annual pilgrimage to 
mecca did not immediately send a cable of condolence 
in lebanon the only country outside iran where khomeinis 
fundamentalism won a beachhead 75000 shiite moslem mourners 
processed through west beirut chanting israel israel is our big 
enemy america america is the great satan death to israel death 
to america 
it is unclear whether khomeinis death will affect the 15 
foreigners held hostage in lebanon most by proiranian extremists 
the hostages include ap correspondent terry a anderson and eight

the writer covered ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
during his fivemonth exile in france in 197879 when the iranian 
clerics islamic revolution was run from a village outside paris 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
every day after lunch the robed turbaned man with eyes like 
nuggets of coal would pick his way across a french village lane and 
address the faithful from the top of a flight of steps 
from the young men mustered at ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
feet would arise a shout that has since become part of the 
international political language 
allahu aqbar allahu aqbar allahu aqbar 
then after the last chant of those arabic words for god is 
great khomeini would shuffle back to his little cottage and the 
war against the shah of iran would continue 
neauphlelechateau a village 20 miles outside paris seemed an 
unlikely place from which to orchestrate a revolution thousands of 
miles away 
khomeini had moved there in september 1978 after 15 years of 
exile in iraq with unrest mounting in his kingdom the shah wanted 
the ayatollah as far away as possible and he had persuaded his 
iraqi neighbors to expel him and the french to give him asylum 
it was a mistake neauphlelechateau meant access to 
international telephones and the world media and these were to 
play a critical role in the revolution 
at first only a handful of supporters gathered at 
neauphlelechateau abolhassan bani sadr future president of the 
islamic republic and sadegh ghotbzadeh and ibrahim yazdi both 
foreign ministersinwaiting 
khomeini lived with his family in the cottage while the 
revolutionaries set up operations across the street in a larger 
house on warm days khomeini would sit under a tree and answer 
questions from his followers 
khomeini was a healthy alert 76 his lifestyle was spartan 
rough blankets to keep out the cold in the unheated cottage an 
apple and a bowl of bean soup for lunch no television 
his most compelling feature was his eyes burning out from under 
glowering black eyebrows that seemed to freeze his face into a 
permanent frown 
his message delivered in a calm low monotone never changed 
the shah must be tried by islamic judges as a mass murderer 
america was corrupt western influence destructive he would soon 
go back to iran and set up an islamic republic governed by islamic 
law it was only a matter of time it was allahs will 
as the uprising in iran spread neauphlelechateau filled up 
with iranian exiles from all over europe they packed the little 
garden outside the operations cottage to overflowing 
everything khomeini said in his daily homily was tape recorded 
and played over the phone to supporters in iran who would rerecord 
the speech and circulate it clandestinely 
a blueandwhite tent was set up for prayers more phones were 
installed and a tapeduplicating machine arrived so that 
khomeinis words could reach iran even faster 
striking iranian telephone operators in iran would take calls 
only from neauphlelechateau 
bearded mullahs manned the phones while westernized iranian 
intellectuals sought out reporters to tell them about the liberal 
islambased constitutional democracy that would arise once the shah 
was gone 
the growing number of reporters churned the garden into mud 
like a hall of mirrors khomeini fed the media and the media fed 
khomeini the french weekly lexpress published a cover photo of 
khomeini above the caption the man who makes the world 
tremble the next day a huge blowup of the cover hung on the 
cottage wall 
on jan 16 the shah left iran and in neauphlelechateau plans 
were made for khomeinis homecoming 
but no airline would carry the party to tehran for fear the 
plane would be shot down so khomeini chartered a boeing it had to 
carry extra fuel in case it was forced to return and only half its 
normal passenger load was permitted 
at a table under a tree scores of journalists and khomeini 
supporters lined up in darkness and freezing rain and paid wads of 
cash for oneway tickets to tehran 
it was the final seal on the surreal often chaotic spectacle 
that had been unfolding in the little french village in the 
preceding weeks 
bani sadr looked elated he would soon become president then be 
brought down and forced to return to paris an exile again 
ghotbzadeh told a reporter he hoped to see him again in tehran 
he would end up slain as khomeinis revolution devoured its own 
children

for judge cynthia hall a vacation is a month 
in malaysia watching birds for judge richard cudahy investments 
earn enough in a year to pay the salaries of all nine supreme court 
justices perhaps twice over 
they are two of the nations several dozen or more millionaire 
federal judges an associated press study of 935 financial 
disclosure reports by federal judges found at least 62 and possibly 
as many as 176 millionaires 
exact numbers cannot be determined because the disclosure forms 
value most assets and income within wide numerical ranges rather 
than in exact dollar amounts 
among the 62 certain millionaires are names familiar to many 
americans 
lewis f powell jr 81 retired supreme court justice with 
investment holdings between 17 million and 32 million powell 
now sits as a senior judge on circuit courts 
circuit judge james l buckley 66 a former new york senator 
and the brother of columnisttalk show host william buckley put 
his holdings between 14 million and 29 million 
circuit judge clement f haynsworth jr 76 nominated 
unsuccessfully by richard nixon to the supreme court in 1969 had 
holdings between 28 million and 46 million 
district judge gerhard a gesell 78 who presided over oliver 
norths irancontra case had holdings between 1 million and 13 
million 
many of the judges made their money in private practice before 
becoming judges others inherited great wealth some such as 
senior circuit judge bailey aldrich of massachusetts did both he 
practiced law for 22 years and is a member of one of americas old 
wealthy families 
aldrich reported an investment portfolio of between 29 million 
and 51 million 
aldrich who at 82 still works full time eight months a year 
believes judges need a pay raise if you want to get good judges 
youve got to pay something not too far below what the judge would 
earn if he was working as a lawyer he said one of the big 
problems is that judges get paid the same whether theyre in 
massachusetts or wyoming a judge in massachusetts is grossly 
underpaid a judge in new york is more than grossly underpaid 
other judges were more reluctant to discuss their wealth or the 
30 percent raise which the federal judges have demanded since 
congress rejected a 51 percent raise for them feb 7 judges 
minimum 89500 salaries already place them in the top 1 percent of 
americans 
i never discuss the economics of being a judge said cudahy 
perhaps the richest judge in america a member of the 7th circuit 
court of appeals in illinois cudahy said i just dont think 
that im terribly representative 
heir to a milwaukee meatpacking concern which he ran for 11 
years the 63yearold cudahy reported holdings worth at least 84 
million and perhaps more than 161 million he has large bond 
holdings as well as an extensive stock portfolio he lists 12 
separate assets as worth over 250000 
cudahys investment income was at least 11 million and 
possibly more than 25 million by comparison the supreme court 
gets an aggregate annual salary of 995000 
judge hall of the 9th circuit court in california is a former 
tax court judge and is the widow of a prominent tax attorney at 
60 she reported holdings of at least 24 million and as much as 
58 million 
fond of travel to asia she said in a 1985 interview that she 
had worried five years earlier when her husband died whether she 
could afford to educate her son and four stepchildren and stay on 
the bench she sent her son to an east coast boarding school and 
decided we could make it financially if we reduced our standard 
of living 
she declined to be interviewed about the pay raise because 
according to a clerk shed prefer not to discuss it with the 
press she just doesnt think its appropriate 
its certain there are more than 62 millionaires because the 
disclosure forms understate wealth the value of the judges homes 
and some other assets are not reported at all 
in addition the ap study did not count the assets and income of 
spouses and dependent children the ap analyzed the forms of the 
935 judges who worked at least 60 days during 1987 the most recent 
year with a complete set of forms 
among the potential millionaires her wealth somewhat obscured 
by the reporting rules is supreme court justice sandra day 
oconnor 59 her holdings were reported between 730000 and 11 
million if her husbands assets were counted those figures would 
be 545000 to 995000 higher even then any equity they have in 
a 660000 suburban home remains unreported 
no other active supreme court justice reported holdings even 
close to 1 million 
among the 62 certain millionaires the average age is 646 years 
all but four are men the women in addition to hall are helen 
w nies of washington dc karen henderson of south carolina and 
maryanne trump barry of new jersey barry who estimated her 
holdings between 18 million and 23 million is the sister of 
new york real estate magnate donald trump 
south carolina with at least six and possibly seven 
millionaires among 13 federal judges has by far the highest 
proportion 
ten states have none of the certain or likely millionaires 
idaho maine montana nebraska new hampshire north dakota south 
dakota utah west virginia and wyoming

a judge today issued a divorce decree for a 
methodist minister who said he wanted to end his marriage to his 
paralyzed wife of 32 years so she could afford nursing care 
our system is such that we must impoverish people so they can 
afford necessary nursing care lawyer virginia johnson said after 
lancaster county judge paul merritt issued the decree for the rev 
lincoln b justice and his wife rose marie 
this is not uncommon said johnson who represented mrs 
justice 56 
after mrs justice was paralyzed from the neck down in an 
automobile accident 10 years ago the couple had a specially 
designed wheelchairaccessible home built and coped using homemaker 
services 
but justice told merritt today that his wifes bout with 
pneumonia in january left her in need of 24hour care 
i cant work and provide that care justice said 
under a property settlement approved by the court mrs justice 
will remain in the lincoln home justice told reporters he expects 
to live in weeping water where he has been transferred and visit 
his exwife about once a week the town is about 35 miles away

johnson said rather than impoverish both husband and wife this 
will allow her to spend down her assets remain in her home and be 
eligible for medicaid

rules would handicap justice to the point he wouldnt be able to 
work the rules also keep mrs justice who wants to live at home

president ali khamenei is irans 
caretaker leader but the true successor to the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini has yet to be chosen 
the transfer of power may be resolved aug 18 when a 
presidential election is scheduled in tandem with a referendum on 
constitutional changes aimed at eliminating a system of competitive 
power centers that has snarled decisionmaking 
khamenei 49 was chosen sunday by the 83member assembly formed 
after khomeinis fundamantalist shiite moslem revolution in 1979 to 
determine the succession and write the new constitution 
khamenei acknowledged his temporary role and said that when the 
constitutional changes have been ratified we should be able to 
fill the vacuum caused by khomeinis death 
reports from tehran indicate iran will have a collective 
leadership of three to five men in the absence of a single figure 
with khomeinis religious and political authority 
in order for that to happen the 20member committee khomeini 
assigned to reform the constitution will have to change the 
religious requirements for leadership to allow lowerranking 
figures to participate 
most analysts believe the power struggle of rival factions and 
leaders will intensify 
here are sketches of the main candidates for a collective 
leadership 
hashemi rafsanjani the 55yearold speaker of parliament a 
middleranking cleric also is military commanderinchief 
rafsanjani is a member of the supreme defense council deputy 
chairman of the assembly of experts and sits on other important 
bodies 
he is a skilled political operator with a wide power base that 
includes parliament and the revolutionary guards corps and leads 
the socalled pragmatists in the hierarchy 
with khameneis support rafsanjani sought to improve relations 
with the west and end irans isolation he was a key figure in 
persuading khomeini to accept the unsponsored ceasefire that 
halted fighting in the 8yearold war with iraq last august 
rafsanjani and his allies were set back by the radical 
resurgence that followed the outcry over salman rushdies novel 
the satanic verses he is the only declared candidate for 
president 
ali akbar mohtashemi the interior minister 43 is among the 
most radical hardliners as ambassador to syria in 19811985 he 
was closely linked to the shiite fundamentalist hezbollah or party 
of god in lebanon and considered by western intelligence to have 
masterminded suicide bombings of american french and israeli 
targets 
he heads much of irans security apparatus and appointed most of 
the 24 provincial governors 
hussein musavi the prime minister 48 is a radical who has 
led the government since 1981 he sits on the 12member council of 
guardians which is dominated by conservatives and oversees all 
legislation and is a member of a special expediency council 
appointed by khomeini in 1988 to resolve differences between the 
parliament and council of guardians 
musavi been criticized mainly for economic policy but survived 
three confidence votes largely through khomeinis support he is 
opposed by conservative clerics and the business class but has the 
support of powerful hard liners 
ayatollah ali meshkini the radical chairman of the assembly of 
experts 66 is a ranking islamic jurist and leader of sabbath 
prayers in the holy city of qom which gives him an important 
platform he is the fatherinlaw of intelligence minister mohammad 
mohammadi reyshahri another major hardliner 
musavi khoeiniha the prosecutorgeneral 47 is antiwestern 
and known as the red mullah because he studied at patrice 
lumumba university in moscow and leipzig university in east germany 
he was removed as head of the pilgrimage bureau for inciting 
pilgrims visiting the shrines of mecca and medina in saudi arabia 
to violence and to spread irans revolution 
khoeiniha was the political leader of student followers of the 
imams line who stormed the us embassy in 1979 he is a leading 
member of the society of combatant clergymen a powerful radical 
group and supports hezbollah which is considered an umbrella for 
shiites holding most of the western hostages in lebanon 
ahmad khomeini the late patriarchs son 43 has wielded 
considerable political influence behind the scenes he holds no 
office but controlled access to his increasingly reclusive father 
and now is making an open bid for power he formerly was allied 
with rafsanjani but now is aligned with mohtashemi and the hard 
liners 
mohammad mohammadi reyshahri the 43yearold intelligence 
minister has emerged as a powerful figure in recent years he is a 
middleranking cleric allied with mohtashemi and the hard liners 
opposed to rafsanjani and formerly served as a judge in the 
military revolutionary tribunals 
ayatollah abdulkarim musavi ardebili the chief justice 63 is 
a centrist and member of the special assembly appointed by khomeini 
in 1988 to resolve differences between the parliament and council 
of guardians

chinese wearing black armbands of mourning are 
streaming to hospitals and university campuses that have been 
turned into makeshift memorial halls in honor of chinas newest 
martyrs 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people are believed to have been 
gunned down during the weekend by chinese troops ordered to clear 
tiananmen square of students demanding a freer society and less 
corruption by their communist rulers 
several dead were taken to fuxing hospital in muxudi site of 
the massacre that began the siege of beijing late saturday night 
by sunday the narrow alley leading to the hospital entrance was 
jammed with people coming to view nearly two dozen victims whose 
bodies were strewn in two hospital rooms for friends or family 
members to identify 
thousands of mourners quietly filed through the rooms quickly 
placing handkerchiefs over their noses against the overpowering 
stench of formaldehyde 
gaping bullet holes were clearly visible on most of the bodies 
some faces were so disfigured that mourners had to pull back the 
bloodsoaked sheets covering the bodies to search for clues to make 
a positive identification 
most of the victims were men in their 20s and 30s one had 
quickly been dressed in a gray suit and red tie while the others 
still had on the torn clothes of the night of the massacre 
i want to cry said a shaken woman as she peered into the 
room from a dirty window 
if we had guns wed get back at them fumed a 40yearold 
worker after viewing the bodies 
by monday many beijing residents were wearing black armbands in 
honor of the students and their supporters who died 
the names of victims were read over the loudspeaker system at 
beijing university large banners and posters honoring the dead 
went up at all major schools 
a generation of brave heroes will go down in the annals of 
history read a blackdraped banner across the main gate at 
beijing normal university one of the major centers of the 
prodemocracy movement 
funeral music blared from loudspeakers in front of the central 
academy of minorities where a black banner with the photograph of 
a fallen student was strung 
across the street an even larger black banner was put up above 
the entrance to the beijing medical university stomatological 
hospital white flowers a traditional chinese sign of mourning 
were draped on trees and the main gate 
students at political science and law university turned the 
foyer of a classroom building into a memorial hall where they 
placed a bloodied and disfigured body of a dead classmate 
a steady stream of students and residents filed through the 
buildings large front doors which were flanked by huge banners 
reading an eternal injustice and tragic beyond compare in 
this human world 
the body lay on a table just to the left of the entrance huge 
chunks of ice were scattered around the body to slow decomposition 
ive come to grieve over the students who died said a 
middleaged worker as he emerged from the building 
after seeing the body a trembling 24yearold woman could only 
berate the government that ordered the murderous attack 
the chinese government is crazy theyve gone way too far

the political fallout from the death of 
irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is likely to prolong the 
captivity of western hostages held by proiranian shiite moslem 
extremists in lebanon 
most of the 15 captives including nine americans are held by 
factions believed controlled by hezbollah or party of god irans 
main lebanese ally 
hezbollahs spiritual guide sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
has tried in vain to keep his party out of the power struggle 
between rival factions in tehran for supremacy in the postkhomeini 
era 
hezbollah militants backed by some 3000 iranian revolutionary 
guards based in the ancient roman city of baalbek in eastern 
lebanon have sided with irans hardliners led by interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi according to shiite sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
yet the partys political leadership in beiruts southern slums 
hezbollahs main power base is aligned with tehrans socalled 
pragmatists led by parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani the 
sources said 
rafsanjani holds hezbollahs purse strings 
no one can tell how badly this split will reflect on the 
hostages but its going to be bad said one source close to 
fadlallah 
theres going to be no way for quite a while to break the 
deadlock shrouding their case said the source 
much will depend on who emerges as the victor in the tehran 
power play but that could take months 
the bush administration will have to sit tight and wait for 
the dust of the tehran power struggle to settle before it can make 
any move on the hostages the source said 
president bush said today in washington he is unsure what will 
happen in iran now that khomeini has died but he added theres 
a way for irans relationship with the united states to improve and 
thats for the release of the american hostages being held in 
lebanon 
there has been no word on the hostages since the latest round of 
fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war broke out march 8 
hezbollah and the rival prosyrian amal militia has stayed out 
of the battles which pit syrian against christian forces many in 
beirut believe the shiites role on the sidelines has minimized the 
risk that the hostages would be hit in shelling that has killed 360 
people and wounded more than 1400 
cardinal john oconnor of new york made a threeday visit to 
lebanon two weeks ago to refocus attention on the hostages 
however he left emptyhanded after his repeated appeals to see the 
american captives drew no reponse 
a week before khomeinis death beiruts ashshiraa magazine 
said the file of the hostages held in lebanon is now in the hands 
of ahmad khomeini the ayatollahs son 
ashshiraa which broke the story of the secret us 
armsforhostages deal that came to be known as the irancontra 
affair also said ahmad khomeini recently summoned several 
hezbollah officials to discuss the hostages 
the magazine said khomeinis son is allied with mohtashemi it 
suggested irans hardliners have taken charge of the hostage issue 
hezbollah publicly contends it has not been involved in the 
waves of kidnapping that have swept lebanon since khomeinis brand 
of fundamentalism swept lebanon in 1983 
but there is little doubt among western and lebanese 
intelligence sources that all four factions holding most of the 
american hostages operate under hezbollahs wing and are controlled 
by the partys militants 
among them is islamic jihad or islamic holy war which claimed 
the abduction of american journalist terry anderson the 
longestheld hostage and us educator thomas sutherland 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 sutherland was grabbed june 9 
of that year 
anglican church envoy terry waite is also believed to be held by 
islamic jihad although no claim has been made he disappeared 
after leaving a west beirut hotel jan 20 1987 for a meeting to 
try to win the americans release

the supreme court today set the stage for an 
important antitrust ruling agreeing to decide whether a major oil 
companys pricecutting plan illegally harmed independent dealers 
the justices said they will review a ruling that revived a 
lawsuit for triple damages against atlantic richfield co arco by 
independent gas stations in california and washington state 
the high court will hear arguments in the case in its next term 
beginning in october with a ruling likely in 1990 
usa petroleum co an independent oil dealer accused arco of 
conspiring with arco gas station dealers to fix prices illegally to 
drive the smaller independents out of business 
arco said its plan lowering gasoline prices to attract more 
customers and discontinuing credit cards to save money is 
legitimate 
arco said its share of the retail gasoline market in california 
and washington was 10 percent to 12 percent in 1981 and increased 
to 14 percent to 16 percent in 1983 as a result of the lower prices 
a federal judge threw out the suit against arco but the 9th 
us circuit court of appeals in a 21 ruling reinstated it last 
october 
the appeals court said that even though there is no proof that 
arco engaged in predatory pricing it still may have injured usa in 
violation of federal antitrust law 
the objective and effect of arcos illegal pricing scheme has 
been to reduce the number of independent gasoline retailers the 
appeals court said this is the type of injury that the antitrust 
rules were meant to prevent 
predatory pricing is defined as setting prices below the level 
necessary to sell a product or below an appropriate measure of the 
cost of producing the product 
in urging the supreme court to hear its appeal arco said the 
7th us circuit court of appeals based in chicago has handed down 
rulings in direct conflict with the 9th circuit court decision 
the case is atlantic richfield vs usa petroleum 881668

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken monday by the supreme court 
 
job bias 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
the court dealt a blow to minorities who contend they are 
victims of onthejob discrimination making it easier for 
employers to refute claims of racial bias based on statistical 
evidence 
the 54 ruling said when minorities allege that statistics show 
they are victims of bias employers do not have to prove their 
practice is nondiscriminatory only that there is a legitimate 
reason for apparently neutral business practices 
in a sharply worded dissent justice john paul stevens said the 
ruling retreats from 18 years of court decisions aimed at 
helping minorities who are victimized by discrimination that may be 
unintentional 
the case is wards cove vs atonio 871387

in a defeat for the church of scientology the justices upheld 
the internal revenue services contention that contributions called 
fixed donations made to the church by its members are not 
charitable contributions that can be counted as federal income tax 
deductions 
the 52 vote rejected the scientologists argument that the irs 
had singled out their church for unfair treatment 
the cases are herandez vs commissioner of internal revenue 
87963 and graham vs commissioner of internal revenue 871616

the justices ordered further lower court hearings to determine 
whether the ccnv and its founder mitch snyder may share in the 
copyright of a work by james earl reid of baltimore entitled 
third world america that depicts the plight of the homeless 
the case is community for creative nonviolence vs reid 88293

the court without comment cleared the way for trial of a 
government lawsuit against junk bond specialist michael milken and 
removed a major obstacle to a 650 million payment by his former 
employer drexel burnham lambert inc to investors and the federal 
treasury 
the justices rejected the appeal by milken and two codefendants 
to disqualify us district judge milton pollack in new york city 
from their case the defendants had contended pollack had an 
apparent conflict of interest because his wife is receiving 30 
million from the sale of a corporation in which drexel burnham 
lambert helped set up the financing 
the case is milken vs sec 881628 
 
cataractsmedicare 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
the court left intact a federal law that generally prohibits 
medicare patients from using their own money to pay for assistant 
surgeons in eye cataract operations 
without comment the court upheld the 1986 law that prevented 
such payments by medicare patients unless the services were 
approved by an insurance carrier or a state committee that reviews 
such medical costs 
the case is new york opthalmological society vs sullivan 
881146 
 
tompkins 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
by a 44 vote the justices upheld the murder conviction and 
death sentence of philip tompkins for a 1981 murder in houston but 
left unresolved the question of how difficult it should be for 
prosecutors to prove they did not exclude potential jurors because 
of their race 
the court in 1986 banned prosecutors from taking race into 
account when picking jurors and tompkins had contended that the 
prosecutor in his case had improperly rejected all 13 black 
potential jurors leaving tompkins a black with an allwhite jury 
justice sandra day oconnor did not participate in the decision 
the case is tompkins vs texas 876405 
 
capital punishment 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

inmate richard boyde who says the states capital punishment law

convenience store clerk dick gibson challeneged the portion of 
the california death penalty law that requires sentencing juries to 
impose death if they find that aggravating factors outweigh 
mitigating ones 
the case is boyde vs california 886613 
 
execution 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
by a 54 vote the court refused to postpone the execution of 
roderick frey in pennsylvania but freys scheduled june 13 
execution had been delayed indefinitely by a lower court last week 
the top court rejected freys bid for a delay even though it has 
agreed to review the constitutionality of pennsylvanias death 
penalty law in an appeal that questions whether the law improperly 
limits the discretion of juries in choosing life or death for 
convicted killers 
frey 52 confessed to hiring charles zehring to murder freys 
wife barbara jean in 1979 
the case is frey vs pennsylvania a914 
 
antitrust 
 
the court set the stage for an important antitrust ruling 
agreeing to decide whether a major oil companys pricecutting plan 
illegally harmed independent dealers 
the justices said they will review a ruling that revived a 
lawsuit for triple damages against atlantic richfield co arco by 
independent gas stations in california and washington state 
the high court will hear arguments in the case in its next term 
beginning in october with a ruling likely in 1990 
the case is atlantic richfield vs usa petroleum 881668

opecs president said today an 
unexpectedly robust oil market could falter and send crude prices 
tumbling as the cartel formally met to set price and production 
levels for the rest of 1989 
there is still considerable inherent weakness in the market 
said rilwanu lukman president of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
lukman said oil prices have surged higher than expected this 
year but he cautioned it was not clear the gains would be 
permanent 
we have yet to ascertain whether they form part of a longterm 
upward trend in pricing levels or whether they merely constitute a 
short or mediumterm cyclical peak he said we therefore urge 
caution against complacency at this stage for these gains have 
yet to be consolidated 
lukman called on the producing nations to hold their output 
levels to the quotas set by the cartel 
potential problems he said could come from increased 
production in areas recently slowed by accidents such as in the 
north sea he also said a pickup in inflation could lead to a 
contraction in industrialized economies 
earlier in the day officials said ministers from nigeria 
venezuela indonesia and algeria met to consider the options after 
a compromise failed to win kuwaiti backing 
theres no deadlock insisted iraqi oil minister issam abdul 
raheem alchalabi 
the cartel is trying to reach a quick agreement on a new pricing 
and production accord in part to let irans oil minister 
gholamreza aqazadeh return home for the funeral of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
the ministers seem in general agreement on lifting their 
julydecember production ceiling to 20 million barrels a day an 
increase of 15 million barrels from the current accord 
an increase along those lines analysts say would likely leave 
oil prices and gasoline prices at the pump unchanged 
an official of one delegation who demanded anonymity said the 
elements of a compromise emerged over the weekend under this plan 
the output cap would be lifted to 20 million barrels a day 
of that sum 500000 would be divided up among five countries 
kuwait the united arab emirates gabon ecuador and qatar those 
countries have been pressing for higher quotas or shares of the 
overall total 
the additional one million barrels would be shared 
proportionately among all 13 
the official said however kuwait has insisted on a still 
higher chunk of the total 
kuwaits oil minister ali khalifa alsabah reportedly wants to 
boost his current quota from 1037 million barrels a day to as much 
as 135 million barrels 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer said he would like to 
see higher crude prices but he declined to say how much the 
market decides the price he said 
nazer the pivotal negotiator in the talks said he expects 
crude oil demand to increase a substantial amount in the 
remainder of the year 
saudi arabia the worlds largest crude exporter pumps nearly a 
quarter of all opec oil giving it powerful leverage over the 
negotiations 
some of the opec countries seeking an advantage at the meeting 
have turned up production in recent weeks total opec output is 
estimated at about 21 million barrels a day 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
has skyrocketed from 1234 a barrel at the end of november to 
nearly 1770 a barrel last week west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude was trading at just under 20 a barrel 
prices have been pushed up not only by opecs output cuts but 
also by accidents in oilproducing areas that have reduced supply 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

the smoot as a unit of measure was 
invented in 1958 at the massachusetts institute of technology when 
freshman fraternity pledges were ordered to measure the length of 
harvard bridge using only chalk and the body of one oliver reed 
smoot jr 
the pranksters manhandled their fellow pledge endtoend like a 
ruler to measure the bridge on the night of the fraternity prank 
the bridge was found to be 3644 smoots plus one ear 
the bridge markings maintained by lambda chi alpha pledges for 
30 years threatened to become extinct when the 1891 bridge 
recently was slated for a 165 million reconstruction 
however the metropolitan district commission and the department 
of public works decided the smoot should stay when the sidewalk was 
replaced 
as a result of the smoot withstanding the test of time it has 
become part of the folklore of the harvard bridge and as such is 
now under the protection of the mdc declared the agencys chief 
bridge engineer david lenhardt at a resmooting ceremony sunday 
out of the 14 pledges i had the distinction of being the 
shortest explained smoot who is 5 feet 7 inches 
and had the best name said peter s miller who was in 
charge of the chalk on that fateful night 
twice a year since freshman pledges have faithfully 
resmooted the bridge that links mit with boston marking each 
10smoot length with a gash of paint on the sidewalk 
the bridges new sidewalk is scored at 5foot 7inch intervals 
instead of the usual 6 feet which will make it easier for future 
pledges to repaint their smoot marks said charles madden senior 
vice president for martin continental construction co the 
contractor rebuilding the bridge 
smoot now an executive with a trade group in washington dc 
lay down to have miller chalk his measure on the new sidewalk 
although the original deed was done in the dark of night 
interrupted once by a patrolling police car that sent the pledges 
scurrying into the shrubs the resmooting was punctuated with 
flash bulbs and applause 
smoot and his son stephen mit class of 90 also posed in front 
of a bronze commemorative plaque that was donated by smoots class 
of 62 at their 25th class reunion

president bush said today he did not want to 
see a total break with china in the wake of the governments 
bloody repression of student demonstrations but he announced a 
series of sanctions in response to the crackdown 
we cannot condone the violent attacks and cannot ignore the 
consequences for our relationship with china bush said in a 
statement in the white house briefing room 
this is not the time for an emotional response bush said in 
explaining to reporters why he had decided not to cut us 
diplomatic ties or to recall ambassador james lilley 
i dont want to see a total break in this relationship and i 
will not encourage a total break in this relationship bush told 
reporters when you see these kids struggling for democracy and 
freedom this would be a bad time for the united states to 
withdraw 
he renewed his call on the government in beijing to avoid force 
and to exercise retraint to signal us displeasure with the 
crackdown which left hundreds of students dead and hundreds of 
others wounded the president said he would suspend all military 
sales and visits of chinese military leaders 
also bush said chinese students wishing to extend their visits 
here would get a sympathetic audience from us officials and he 
said he was encouraging the red cross and other humanitarian 
agencies to speed help to the injured 
the state department later announced all american students in 
beijing were being advised to leave the campuses and gather in 
hotels because of the chaotic situation 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said there had been no threats 
against the americans 
in other actions the state department issued a new travel 
advisory cautioning americans not to visit the country and 
instituted a socalled warden system of asking those already in 
china to make their presence known to us diplomatic offices 
taking the long view bush said he was confident democracy will 
triumph the genie cannot be put back in the bottle again he 
said 
bush who headed the us liaison office in beijing during the 
opening days of modern uschina ties is slated to meet with 
congressional leaders this afternoon 
although the topic is last weeks nato summit white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said he expected the group also would 
discuss the chinese crisis 
bush released a statement saturday after chinese troops opened 
fire on demonstrators in beijing saying the administration 
deplored the violent turn of events and urged restraint 
nonviolence and dialogue 
on sunday sen jesse helms rnc and rep stephen solarz 
dny from the far points of the liberal and conservative 
spectrum joined forces on cbstvs face the nation to demand 
that bush end military aid in retaliation for the bloody 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrators 
solarz said that unless bush took a stronger stand on china 
congress will do it for him 
solarz is chairman of the house foreign affairs asian 
subcommittee and helms is the ranking gop member of the senate 
foreign relations committee 
besides calling for the immediate return of lilley solarz said 
the united states should consider a suspension of trade in 
hightechnology items and a change in immigration regulations to 
allow prodemocracy chinese students to remain in america until it 
is clear they wont be punished 
i think it would be politically unacceptable and morally 
unthinkable for us to continue to sell arms to a country that 
is engaged in the wanton slaughter of its own people solarz said 
helms said he believed there was strong bipartisan support 
for the move 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of foreign relations 
subcommittee on east asian and pacific affairs also called for a 
halt to all military assistance and cooperation with the peoples 
republic of china saying uschinese relations had been dealt a 
bloody blow 
but sen richard lugar rind another member of the senate 
panel advised a cautious approach 
he ought to keep our ambassador there we ought to 
maintain our agreements to supply aid lugar said on nbctvs 
meet the press the senator said the us leverage in the 
matter is always very limited there are some situations we 
really cannot control 
former secretary of state henry kissinger who helped forge the 
first us ties to china during president nixons term also 
advised that the president cant afford emotional outbursts in 
the present situation 
appearing on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
kissinger said he was appalled by the events in beijing but 
cautioned that the united states must be very careful about 
considering cutting ties with the chinese in order not to give the 
soviet union a free ride in influence in asia 
the uschinese relationship has blossomed on economic 
military and political fronts since formal diplomatic relations 
were established in 1979 
since that time the united states has sold more than 748 
million in arms to china most recently a 100 million deal in 
which beijing purchased six chinook ch47d helicopters manufactured 
by boeing co 
china with us approval also reached a 245 million agreement 
with grumman corp in 1987 under which the us company improved 
the avionics of chinas f8 fighter jet

the communist party today said solidarity 
candidates overwhelmingly won the countrys first democratic 
elections since world war ii and that voters apparently removed 
some party officials from parliament 
the party acknowledged the solidarity triumph in a statement at 
the start of the evening newscast by its spokesman jan bisztyga 
who was shown sitting at the elbow of solidarity national spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz 
the results are genuinely unfavorable for the partyled 
coalition he said the elections had a plebiscite nature and 
solidarity got a decided majority however he did not give 
specific results 
final official results from sundays election for a new senate 
and the existing sejm or lower house were not expected until 
wednesday 
bisztyga pledged that the party would not quarrel with the 
results we will not back away from the road of democracy and 
reforms but he called on the opposition to also share 
responsibility for the country 
if feelings of triumph and adventurism cause anarchy in 
poland democracy and social peace will be seriously threatened 
authorities the coalition and the opposition cannot allow such a 
situation he said 
onyszkiewicz spoke briefly after bisztyga and cautioned that 
some returns were still coming in but despite that it is a 
victory he declared 
earlier in the day when partial returns indicated a solidarity 
landslide lech walesa the leader of the newly legalized union 
said its too early for congratulations and we dont have 
complete information yet 
in its first dispatch on results the official pap news agency 
tonight confirmed overwhelming solidarity victories in at least 11 
cities it cautioned that the results were unofficial and might 
vary in other places 
only a few solidarity candidates in the race for the new 
100seat senate appeared unsure of firstround victory said 
onyszkiewicz indicating firm opposition control of the east blocs 
first freely chosen legislative chamber 
under an agreement with solidarity the communist party was to 
receive 65 percent of the sejm to achieve that some communist 
party candidates ran unopposed but the partys results indicated 
that some of them did not get the 50 percent voter approval 
required to be elected 
it was not immediately clear what would happen to any sejm seats 
not filled in the election solidarity argued they should be left 
vacant but the government left open the possibility of another 
election for just those seats 
the economy is a shambles and the communists badly needed the 
oppositions cooperation if it is to be revived 
under the deal struck april 5 by communist authorities and 
solidarity the opposition was given a chance to control the 
senate the opposition gained the rights to field candidates for 
all 100 senate seats and for 161 or 35 percent of those in the 
460member sejm 
the communists were thereby theoretically guaranteed a majority 
when the chambers jointly convene to elect the president but the 
senate would have veto power over all legislation approved by the 
sejm 
no results announced today official or unofficial indicated 
that a communist party candidate won a seat on the 100member 
senate 
unofficial returns issued earlier today showed that with 159 of 
1253 voting stations reporting in warsaw solidarity candidates 
for the three senate seats from warsaw were leading handily the 
solidarity tallies indicated all had obtained more than 70 percent 
of the vote 
the numbers were similar in the races for the sejm 
in the southern city of krakow with about half the precincts 
reporting solidaritys senate candidates led all others for the 
two seats drawing in 83 percent and 74 percent of the vote the 
solidarity campaign there said 
in a district near krakow with 62 percent of precincts 
reporting the solidarity senate hopefuls had 82 percent and 75 
percent of the vote the campaign said 
results from gdansk showed solidarity also well ahead in the 
sejm races and indicated that prominent party figures and their 
allies running for the sejm were failing to get the 50 percent 
approval required 
partial results showed that the highest votegetter on the party 
list of candidates in gdansk poltiburo member wladyslaw baka 
received 44 percent of the votes based on reports of 20 of the 
baltic ports 189 precincts

two million mourners crowded into a tehran 
square monday to glimpse the whiteshrouded body of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini and at least eight were killed and hundreds hurt 
during the huge show of mass grief 
state television showed scores of people being carried from the 
dusty mousalam square the crowd swayed around the glasscovered 
bier in which the revolutionary patriarch lay his trademark black 
turban on his chest 
iranians flowed into the north tehran square under a blazing 
sun drawn by the tightly shrouded body in its airconditioned 
cubicle on a platform hastily assembled from shipping containers 
mourners beat their chests and heads with fists in a traditional 
shiite moslem expression of grief chanting oh khomeini why 
have you left us some scratched their faces until the blood ran 
and threw ashes over their clothes 
imam khomeini was our great leader nothing can ever 
replace him said mohammad mahdi an aircraft technician 
iranians called khomeini their imam or spiritual leader 
the official islamic republic news agency said the dead were 
crushed in a stampede to the bier and many people collapsed in the 
heat which reached a temperature of 104 
khomeini died saturday of a heart attack suffered 11 days after 
surgery for internal bleeding his death created irans most 
serious political crisis since he was swept to power in the 1979 
islamic revolution 
ahmad khomeinis son read a section of his fathers political 
testament over the radio it called for national unity and warned 
of enemy conspiracies and worlddevouring america 
in washington president bush said theres a way for the 
relationship with the united states to improve and thats for the 
release of the american hostages held in lebanon by proiranian 
kidnappers 
lord glenarthur a foreign office minister said in london that 
britain is prepared to resume normal diplomatic relations if iran 
renounces terrorism and violence 
pope john paul ii on a pilgrimage to scandinavia said of 
khomeini it is necessary to state with great respect and with 
deep reflection his impact on his country and a considerable part 
of the world 
israeli leaders expressed hope that former friendly relations 
with iran could be resumed israel can only hope that the future 
leadership in iran will have a more positive attitude toward human 
rights the west and israel said allon liel foreign ministry 
spokesman 
in its first official reaction iraq called for a lasting peace 
with iran the official newspaper althawra daily newspaper said in 
an editorial that iraq wants a comprehensive and just peace 
beased on goodneighborly relations and noninterference in each 
others affairs 
a unmediated ceasefire suspended the 8yearold war aug 20 
but peace negotiations are deadlocked 
the extract of khomeinis poltiical testament read by his son 
said nothing of who would succeed him as leader of the revolution 
president ali khamenei 49 was appointed caretaker leader 
sunday winning 60 of the 74 votes cast the assembly of experts 
chosen by khomeini in 1979 to handle the succession 
a presidential election and a referendum on constitutional 
reforms which are likely to increase the presidents executive 
power are scheduled for aug 18 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani wiping away tears with a 
white handkerchief tried to address the mourners from the mossalla 
mosque overlooking mousalam square but broke down 
beloved imam this nation has shown it will not forget you 
and we beg that you will not forget us either he said 
rafsanjani said on television earlier we are confident we are 
able to follow in the imams path he said the choice of khamenei 
as caretaker is the sign we are moving correctly the people need 
not worry at all 
in a gesture of respect rafsanjani referred to khamenei as 
ayatollah although the president is only a middleranking 
cleric called hojatoleslam 
in the absence of anyone with khomeinis religious and political 
authority it seems likely iran will be ruled by a collective 
leadership 
khamenei a moderate with close ties to the merchant class has 
been president since 1981 but is barred by the constitution from a 
third fouryear term 
the constitutional reforms up for approval aug 18 are expected 
to increase the presidents executive power khamenei has endorsed 
the candidacy of rafsanjani a political ally and the only declared 
candidate so far 
former president abolhassan banisadr said from exile in france 
that khamenei would head a leadership group including rafansajani 
and ahmad khomeini 
a week before khomeinis death there was a compromise between 
rafsanjani ali khamenei and ahmad khomeini banisadr said 
in an american television interview 
they chose khamenei as guide because he is somehow a neutral 
man he said

iraq on monday called for a comprehensive 
peace with iran following the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
at the same time iranian rebels based in iraq shut down their 
propaganda machine in what diplomats suspect was an iraqi move to 
muzzle them in a goodwill gesture to tehran 
in baghdads first official reaction to khomeinis death on 
saturday the althawra daily said iraq once again calls for 
a comprehensive and just peace based on good neighborly relations 
and noninterference in each others internal affairs 
iran and iraq declared a ceasefire in their eightyear war in 
august 1988 but have not concluded a peace treaty 
the newspaper mouthpiece of the ruling baath socialist party 
said in an editorial that the death of khomeini means the passing 
of a vicious despot who spared no effort to fulfill his dream of 
building a persian empire at the expense of iraq and other arab 
nations 
it warned that khomeinis death will trigger a chapter of 
struggle among different factions in tehran 
but it stressed that iraq is looking forward to the new rulers 
working for a peace settlement to the gulf war and new relations 
based on noninterference 
the armyrun aljomhuriya daily noted that khomeinis death has 
opened the gates for peace between the two persian gulf 
neighbors 
iraq has repeatedly charged that peace talks to formally end the 
persian gulf war have deadlocked because political feuding in 
tehran has paralyzed irans decisionmaking 
the editorials clearly reflected baghdads hopes that a more 
flexible leadership will emerge in tehran following khomeinis 
death 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors announced in 
baghdad that in the wake of khomeinis death they have halted 
publication of their magazines shut down their television station 
in iraq that beams propaganda into western iran and called off 
antikhomeini demonstrations in world capitals planned for june 20 
the mujahedeen noted however that their radio station the 
voice of mujahed will continue broadcasting 16 hours a day 
the group the main iranian opposition movement said in a 
statement the actions were part of efforts to make evergreater 
preparations to overthrow the remnants of khomeinis regime 
but diplomats in baghdad said it appeared that the shutdown was 
more likely ordered by the iraqi government to minimize mujahedeen 
propaganda and encourage iranian leaders to respond to iraqs peace 
call 
the diplomats said that was the only explanation for the 
mujahedeen action at a time when they had been expected to 
intensify their propaganda to exploit the political uncertainty in 
iran 
mujahedeen officials said sunday that their military arm the 
national liberation army of iran was ready to return to iran to 
overthrow the tehran government at the appropriate time 
there was no indication that the army with a strength estimated 
at more than 20000 fighters was preparing military action

three out of five newspaper people rate their 
paper as adequate but not outstanding and even most of their 
bosses feel that way according to a survey released monday by the 
american society of newspaper editors 
four editors who presented the study at a news conference said 
that given the selfcritical nature of the business they were not 
surprised that only 34 percent of reporters copy editors 
photographers and news executives rated their papers very high 
five percent put the paper down as poor while 61 percent chose 
to describe them as adequate 
when only executives were counted the ratings were somewhat 
higher fortysix percent gave their papers a very high rating 
54 percent thought they were only adequate and 1 percent ranked 
them as poor 
only on big papers those with circulations over 250000 did a 
bare majority 52 percent rate their papers highly 
asne president loren ghiglione editor of the southbridge 
mass news and past president john seigenthaler editor and 
publisher of the nashville tennessean said so selfcritical an 
attitude was healthy and reflected the idealism of journalists 
seigenthaler recalled that in his career as a reporter he had a 
low regard for his paper on days his stories were cut or not 
prominently displayed 
linda grist cunningham executive editor of the parsippany 
nj daily record said the ratings may demonstrate disagreement 
between editors and reporters over a papers mission if the paper 
sees its job as covering the city council thoroughly but the 
reporter sees it as investigative journalism those results would 
be inevitable and would show the paper needs to communicate 
better with staff and readers alike what were supposed to be 
doing she said 
and barbara a henry editor of the rochester ny timesunion 
and democrat and chronicle said the results reflect a tendency 
among journalists to be more critical than other people of their 
performance 
when we get together we talk about what isnt good she said 
the findings were drawn from 1200 valid responses out of 1345 
sought from 72 newspapers chosen randomly in circulation groups 
to represent a crosssection of the nations nearly 55000 
professionals on nearly 1600 daily papers 
fiftyfour percent of participants said the paper was getting 
better that view was especially prevalent among people on big 
papers and people who had been with their paper 25 years or more 
thirteen percent said the paper was getting worse 33 percent saw 
it as marking time 
a third of participants thought newspapers will be less 
important in american life by the year 2000 than now twelve 
percent said they will be more vital and 55 percent saw no change 
only 42 percent of participants gave their immediate superior a 
high rating 45 percent rated the boss as adequate and 13 percent 
as poor 
other findings 
copy editors who edit reporters stories before they are 
published give their jobs a lower rating than other people in the 
newsroom when asked to compare it to previous work fortythree 
percent thought newspapers will be less important than now in the 
year 2000 and 43 percent said they would be unhappy if still doing 
the same job in five years the study called the copy desk the 
mount everest of newsroom discontent 
members of racial minorities are more pleased with their 
careers than white 85 percent of the minorities would choose 
newspapering again but 49 percent of the blacks aged 26 to 35 
think race is the biggest obstacle to their advancement 
nearly twothirds of those surveyed describe themselves as 
democrats or liberal or leaning that way twentytwo percent call 
themselves republicans or conservative and 17 percent define 
themselves as independent 
a lack of feedback is more important to most participants than 
pay thirtysix percent said they would improve communication if 
they were put in charge while only 25 percent would improve pay and 
benefits three quarters said they got little or only occasional 
feedback on small papers pay was more important however than 
staff communication

the government has sent thousands of troops into 
the southern republic of uzbekistan to quell ethnic rioting that 
has killed two people injured at least 72 and burned thousands of 
homes official media said monday 
eight policemen were reported wounded and 48 people detained in 
the fergana valley region in a rampage sparked by clashes between 
members of the uzbek majority and an ethnic turk minority 
the rioting in the central asian republic about 1500 miles 
southeast of moscow began as the soviet unions latest ethnic 
violence but it was fueled by chronic unemployment in the region 
and soon turned into vicious clashes between thousands of furious 
people soviet television reported 
soviet interior minister vadim bakatin told the nightly 
television news program vremya this outburst has been provoked 
by somebody so far i cant say by whom but its clear that some 
evil forces are involved who think that the worse things are the 
better 
bakatin interviewed in uzbekistan warned that 6000 interior 
ministry troops were brought in sunday night after a curfew was 
imposed on the troubled areas and more were on the way so we 
have enough force to resist hooligans and extremists 
let no one think they can give us ultimatums he said 
ultimatums will not succeed here 
vremya showed smoking hulks of houses and cars the remains of 
sunday nights violence it said armed extremists in cars and on 
motorcycles would appear and disappear unexpectedly injuring 
people and torching buildings 
the soviet congress on monday issued an appeal calling upon 
those involved in ethnic clashes to turn to the voice of reason 
and stop the bloodshed president mikhail s gorbachev read it 
aloud and it was broadcast live to the nation as part of the 
congress proceedings 
think about all the innocents who are threatened women 
children and old people and stop prevent injustice from being 
committed it said 
the spiritual leader of central asias millions of moslems 
mufti mahammadsadyk mamayusupov also appealed for calm 
in margelan one of the towns in the region party leaders 
retreated into their headquarters behind the protection of a ring 
of soldiers instead of trying to hold a dialogue with protesters 
vremya said 
it complimented the interior ministry troops for behaving very 
delicately in a complex situation apparently meaning they had 
caused no injuries 
no units of the red army have been brought in to bolster police 
and internal forces tass said army troops were last used to 
handle soviet ethnic unrest in georgia where their april 9 clash 
with protesters left at least 19 dead 
the last report of fatalities in an ethnic disturbance in 
central asia occurred in december 1986 when the kazakhstan capital 
of alma ata was rocked by rioting touched off when the local 
communist party leader a kazakh was replaced by an ethnic 
russian two people were killed in the first major outbreak of 
ethnic violence since gorbachevs rise to power in march 1985 
gorbachevs policies of greater openness and more tolerance of 
dissent have been followed by outbursts of ethnic and nationalist 
unrest in several of the soviet unions 15 republics and among its 
scores of ethnic groups

taking a tough line president bush on monday 
ruled out any us overtures to the new regime in iran and demanded 
the release of the nine americans held hostage in lebanon 
bush told a white house news conference iran has been a 
terrorist state as soon as we see some move away from oppression 
and extremism of that nature we will review our relationship he 
said 
he described ali khamenei as the apparent successor to the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini indicating the us government may 
expect some jockeying for control the iranian president was chosen 
sunday night by 80 islamic theologians to succeed khomeini 
but bush when asked who was in charge in tehran after the death 
of the 86yearold fundamentalist cleric said were not sure 
yet 
in a society of that nature its hard to predict he said 
bush was positive however about not offering any us 
incentives to iran in an attempt to repair the nineyear break in 
us relations with the persian gulf country 
no absolutely not bush said about any overtures they 
know what they need to do they have been a terrorist state 
referring to his inaugural speech bush said i would simply 
repeat what i said on january 20th that theres a way for the 
relationship with the united states to improve and that is for a 
release of the american hostages 
us relations with iran were broken in april 1980 five months 
after the us embassy was overrun and american diplomats clerical 
workers and marine guards taken hostage 
the action was taken by revolutionaries angered by the support 
the united states had given the toppled shah reza pahlavi the last 
52 hostages were released on president reagans inaugural day in 
january 1981 after 444 days in captivity 
in line with the diplomatic break americans were cautioned not 
to travel to iran and firms were directed not to deal with iran 
two years ago after it was discovered that large quantities of 
iranian oil that had passed through third parties was reaching the 
united states the ban was made virtually airtight 
only humanitarian assistance was permitted to go to iran 
still while urging other countries to join the boycott reagan 
secretly approved us weapons shipments to iran in an effort to 
gain the release of american hostages in lebanon and to moderate 
the tehran regime 
the state departments office for counterterrorism lists nine 
americans as held by iranianinspired shiite lebanese also iran 
is widely suspected of having played a role in the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland last year that killed 270 
people 
on sunday the white house expressed hope that after khomeinis 
death iran would adopt a responsible role in the world 
community 
former president carter who was in the white house when the 
embassy was seized and then suffered politically by being unable to 
free the hostages offered some conciliatory remarks sunday outside 
his church in plains ga 
i know he was a great hero in his own nation carter said of 
khomeini who may have cost the former president any chance of 
reelection in 1980 my hope is that his successor will be more 
inclined toward peace and reconciliation

new york city has more reported aids cases than 
the next four largest cities combined and the epidemic is moving 
swiftly through populations of drug abuses minorities and the 
poor the citys top health official said monday 
the citys experience with the epidemic is in many ways a 
foretelling of the future of aids for many other cities and 
countries of the world said new yorks commissioner of health 
dr stephen joseph 
an examination of this experience will yield i suggest 
useful and important insights for application on the global 
scale he told the fifth international conference on aids 
new york recently recorded its 20000th case of the acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome more than combined totals reported in 
los angeles san francisco houston and washington dc 
more than 10700 new yorkers have died from the disease and 
about 200000 are infected joseph told the montreal meeting 
sixty percent of new yorks intravenous drug abusers already 
have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv that 
causes aids in 1988 for the first time the number of new cases 
in drug abusers equaled the number of new cases in homosexual men 
the increasing role of the drug abuser makes aids more a 
disease of poor families he said 
in 1988 blacks and hispanics made up close to 70 percent of new 
yorkers with aids 
more and more cocaine and crack are the engines driving the 
spread of hiv infection among drug users and their sex partners 
joseph said 
he elicited shouting and boos from activists when he said the 
epidemic is reaching the point where it would be useful to begin 
confidential reporting of the names of people who test positive and 
to begin tracking their sexual contacts more actively 
i think we will see a relative shift from anonymous to 
confidential testing he said citing the increasing possibility 
of preventing or at least forestalling illness in people infected 
with the virus but otherwise healthy 
in other reports the national gay rights advocates a public 
interest law firm in san francisco reported that medicaid coverage 
for aids patients varies widely from state to state 
the brutal fact is that under the present medicaid system a 
recipients ability to survive the aids crisis often hinges upon 
his or her state of residence the groups report said 
dr john phair of northwestern university medical school in 
chicago reported the homosexual men who develop aids soonest are 
those with the most sexual partners during their lifetimes his 
study also showed that most newly infected homosexual men will not 
develop aids for more than 3 years 
researchers at the university of miami reported that of 122 
homeless men and four homeless women who volunteered for aids 
tests 14 or 11 percent were infected the rate of hiv 
infection among homeless persons voluntarily seeking testing is 
relatively high the researchers said 
josephs speech was constantly interrupted by shouts and 
chanting from aids activists many from new york they were 
especially critical of his call for confidential reporting of the 
names of infected people fearing such information could be used to 
discriminate against victims 
joseph estimated the cost of treating aids patients and others 
infected will exceed 7 billion during the next five years 
by the end of 1993 the city will need 4000 to 5000 hospital 
beds daily to care for infected patients he said they now occupy 
1600 beds in new york

with strong words and an even stronger 
gesture president bush lent his moral support monday to the 
students struggling for democracy in china 
the words came in a stern statement read at a hastily called 
white house news conference 
the gesture came a few hours later when four chinese graduate 
students were ushered into the oval office for a meeting with the 
president of the united states 
the white house had rounded up the guests by contacting local 
universities and asking for names of chinese students active in 
support of the prodemocracy demonstrations in their homeland 
like state visitors the four students had their pictures taken 
and their words recorded by a horde of reporters on hand to 
chronicle the opening of the meeting 
when jia hao 38 a doctoral student at george washington 
university began speaking before all the cameras were ready bush 
held up him a moment to make sure none of the media missed the 
words 
the political science student from shanghai then spoke with the 
aplomb of someone accustomed to teteatetes with world leaders 
bushs actions including a suspension on arms sales to china 
will be a great support spiritually and physically to the people 
who are fighting for the freedom and the democracy and after all 
for chinas future he said also it will be a big blow to 
those who are responsible for the massacre those butchers of 
beijing 
bush later praised his eloquence thanked the students for 
coming and added i apologize to you for the short notice then 
he gave the other visitors a turn to speak 
shen zhengfun 34 who is pursuing two doctorates in sociology 
at the university of maryland and economics at american university 
said we are very glad to be here to have the chance to give 
you our views 
normally we dont do questions at these bush explained to 
the visitors but i might tell you what we want to do is to 
continue to find ways to support democracy 
weve got to speak out against the brutality and you just 
did it very eloquently he said to jia hao but somehow make 
clear that our argument like yours is just with those who resort 
to force certainly not to the chinese people 
a white house press aide called out lights thank you that 
is the customary signal for the media to file out leaving the 
president and his guests to talk in privacy 
bush would have none of it he motioned for the students to keep 
talking 
zhao shanyang 31 studying for a phd in sociology at the 
university of maryland said i think all of us are patriotic and 
we want to promote the movement in china we think the popular 
revolution is not something caused or promoted by any foreign 
country 
bush nodded in agreement 
but we as students from china are very concerned and certainly 
want to do anything in our very humble efforts to help said zhao 
shanyang 
as aides again made a move to clear the room bush said no 
no let them make this point 
shi zhengfun then spoke up again praising bushs measured 
response to the crisis the situation in china he said is 
very critical very sensitive we wish the united states could do 
more but we also understand that its very complicated and that 
the response made by this country will certainly affect things that 
are happening in china a measured response i think may help the 
things in china move toward a good direction 
bush smiled for he had made much the same point at his news 
conference 
the fourth student han xiaoxing 35 a phd candidate in 
political science at georgetown university did not speak while 
reporters were in the oval office 
bush met with the four students for 45 minutes 15 minutes 
longer than planned

heralded by an explosion 
i heard a loud sound like thunder and rushed outside my 
home the 27yearold farmer said the next moment the earth 
moved under my feet tossing me aside and my home disappeared under 
mud and rock 
dissanayakes mother and father were trapped in the house and 
killed

the polish election allowing the 
opposition to share power with the communist party is a major part 
of the historic movement for political reform in the east bloc and 
the soviet union 
polands first competitive election in four decades could end 
the communist partys political monopoly at a time when other 
soviet bloc leaders are considering democratic change without 
losing power 
the emergence of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in 1985 and 
his call for openness and economic restructuring gave kremlin 
approval to reforms that leaders in poland and hungary where quick 
to embrace 
leaders of other east bloc countries such as bulgaria romania 
east germany and czechoslovakia still cringe at a possible 
challenge to their power 
the stimulus for change in the soviet union and hungary comes 
from reformminded communists in poland an independent opposition 
strongly influenced by the solidarity independent union movement 
has led the reform drive 
party and opposition reformers in eastern europe hope change can 
be achieved gradually rather than by a revolution that might 
disrupt europes postwar alliances 
a sovietled warsaw pact invasion of czechoslavakia in 1968 
ended a communist party effort to reform socialism 
polands fledgling opposition took a different path in the 
1970s a unique alliance between workers and opposition 
intellectuals was forged that paved the way for solidarity which 
was born in august 1981 and led the fight for political reform 
solidarity directly challenged the communist partys claim to 
rule in the name of the working class and the party tried to crush 
the union in the dec 13 1981 martiallaw crackdown that 
demoralized much of the nation 
but gorbachev revived hope that change was possible 
after a polish political amnesty in 1986 two waves of strikes 
last year and continuing economic crisis the opposition was strong 
enough again in 1988 to press its demands for legalization of 
solidarity 
after two months of talks the two sides reached a historic 
accord april 5 that legalized the union again after a sevenyear 
ban in exchange for opposition support of partially democratic 
elections to parliament 
there is no doubt without gorbachev the situation in poland 
could not have happened said historian bronislaw geremek a 
close adviser to solidarity leader lech walesa 
the march elections in the soviet union to the congress of 
peoples deputies do not go as far as poland in allowing voters to 
freely choose their representatives 
the communist party of the soviet union retained control of 
access to the ballot limiting the number of independent candidates 
and cutting off anyone who challenged its ultimate authority 
but for the first time in 71 years soviet voters were able to 
choose between rival candidates and in rare cases radical 
reformers like boris yeltsin were able to muster enough popular 
support to be seated in the congress 
as a result a soviet parliamentary session going on now has 
been marked by heated debates on such subjects such as the soviet 
invasion of afghanistan the kgb the performance of top officials 
and the sovereignty of individiual republics 
by contrast in poland candidates totally independent of the 
party were allowed to stand for 161 seats of the sejm as the 
existing parliament is called and for all 100 seats of the newly 
created senate the east blocs first democratically elected 
legislative chamber 
some poles criticized solidarity for accepting partially free 
elections with no guarantee that authorities will keep a pledge to 
hold completely democratic elections in four years 
historian geremek said solidarity had no choice 
we decided to accept what was possible because there were 
two dangers he said one was the risk of a social explosion 
that later even political decisions could not solve and we thought 
the international context might not last 
opposition activists in poland meanwhile express hope that the 
hungarian communist partys commitment to a multiparty system may 
influence polish leaders who so far have rejected new political 
parties as such 
parliamentary elections are due in hungary next year and for the 
first time since the communists consolidated power in 1948 other 
parties will be able to take part 
if poland got a contract at too low a level we think the 
hungarians will do better and that will influence our situation 
geremek said

the environmental protection agency has agreed 
to abandon a site off the texas gulf coast designated as the 
countrys only location for ocean incineration of hazardous wastes 
agency officials said monday 
steps to revoke the designation of the site 220 miles east of 
brownsville hinge on resolution of a federal lawsuit in the 
district of columbia the case challenges the epas decision not to 
issue a permit to a connecticut company seaburn inc for 
industrial waste incineration at sea 
epa argued in court it may not issue permits without 
incineration regulations in place and it has decided not to issue 
those regulations also the agency argued congressional action 
last year barring new ocean dumping of industrial waste also bars 
incineration 
although the court in april sided with epas position time has 
not run out for seaburn inc to appeal the decision said tudor 
davies director of epas office of marine and estuarine protection 
once the court case is resolved the epa will officially propose 
to revoke the site designation 
epa will begin proceedings to dedesignate the site and the 
conclusion of the judicial process in that case if the courts 
ultimately uphold the agencys view of the law said a may 24 
letter to sen phil gramm rtexas signed by william a 
whittington acting deputy assistant administrator of the epa water 
office 
epa decided in 1977 to formally designate the gulf of mexico 
site in the event it eventually formulated regulations to permit 
the burning of toxic wastes at sea early last year the agency 
decided not to proceed because of widespread concerns about the 
impact of incineration

trade between china and the united states 
jumped by more than a third last year to a record 134 billion 
the us international trade commission reported monday 
the increase marked a rise from the 1987 total of 97 billion 
in 1978 the figure surpassed the 1 billion mark for the first 
time 
a high rate of industrial growth in china during 1988 was 
accompanied by record high inflation the report noted 
now like many other big us trading partners china sells much 
more than it buys in this country the us deficit with china rose 
to 34 billion from 28 billion the year before 
chinese sales to the united states rose by 22 billion to a 
total of more than 8 billion the increased chinese exports were 
largely manufactured goods such as toys and games but also items 
that take more technical skill to produce electrical sound 
recording and telecommunications equipment 
us exports were largely raw materials they also rose by 15 
billion to more than 5 billion with the increase led by 
chemicals wheat and softwood logs 
the report noted that a new agreement with china on limiting 
us imports of textiles went into effect last year there were 
also new accords on sea transport and on launching americanbuilt 
communications satellites from chinese soil an agreement on 
favorable us tariff rates was renewed 
us trade with the soviet union showed a surplus of 22 
billion twice the 1987 figure thanks to increased sales of corn 
wheat soybeans and fertilizers the soviets increased their 
exports by 155 million largely because of increased fuel oil 
shipments trade with the soviets was up but at 33 billion it 
was less than onefourth the china trade 
the report called attention to improvement in us trade 
relations with the soviets including lifting of the embargo on 
soviet furs extension of the agreemment on us grain sales 
increased interest among us companies in doing business in the 
soviet union 
overall us trade with communist countries reached a record 
192 billion in 1988 up from 138 billion the year before 
increases were registered with all eastern european countries with 
the exception of hungary

mississippi teachers salaries are off the 
bottom thanks to four years of big raises and educators in the 
nations poorest state are starting to see dividends higher scores 
on national achievement tests 
but state education officials say the efforts that moved teacher 
pay from 50th to 45th in the united states must continue 
we have to make a bold commitment to our children that we 
dont want them to be 50th said olon ray education assistant to 
gov ray mabus an important part of that is having a good 
teacher in every classroom 
the 198889 national average teacher salary was 29567 the 
state department of education estimates the average in mississippi 
at 22677 the 198889 average in the southeastern states was 
24863 
education leaders hope the prospect of fatter pay checks will 
attract better teachers and help enhance student performance 
a us department of education report released may 3 showed that 
mississippi students scored worst among those in 28 states where 
the american college testing program or act is the predominant 
college entrance examination 
however state officials noted that performance had improved 
with the average mississippi act score up 07 point to 162 in 1988 
over 1987 nationwide the average score was up 01 point to 188 
and declines were shown in 11 states the test is scored on a scale 
of 1 to 36 
officials credit the 1982 education reform act which made 
sweeping changes in mississippis education system for the 
improvements and mabus has promised to propose an education 
reform ii package this year 
mabus made education improvements in general and teacher 
salaries specifically a cornerstone of his successful 1987 
campaign 
he pushed through the legislatures 1988 session a teacher pay 
raise averaging 3800 over two years the second half takes effect 
in july 
that money added to 3000 in 1986 and 2400 in 1987 helped 
move mississippi teacher salaries from next to last place to 45th 
among the 50 states and the district of columbia as of march 16 
state education officials said they said monday that based on 
national education association figures mississippi now is followed 
by louisiana north dakota oklahoma west virginia arkansas and 
south dakota 
teacher pay is the key issue to being able to both recruit and 
retain good people into the classroom ray said 
mabus wanted in 1988 to raise state teacher salaries to what was 
then the southeastern average but the mississippi association of 
educators the states largest teacher organization wants salaries 
to reach the national average by 1995 
dr joe ross of vicksburg chairman of the state board of 
education said mississippi has made progress but he believes the 
state should continue pressing toward the southeastern average 
theres no question but that weve made great strides in the 
past couple of years but everybody else keeps going up too 
ross said 
i think the fact is that nobody who went into education ever 
went in with the idea that they could get rich state education 
superintendent richard boyd said it was a field where people 
thought they could do some good for humanity but it makes it more 
attractive if they know that they can made a decent living 
ross said students entering college would look more favorably at 
teaching if they knew they could make a reasonable living 
a lot of people like to talk about education being a 
calling said peggy peterson president of the 13000member mae 
yes you have to be dedicated but you cant live on dedication 
and you cant live on chalk dust

new prime minister sousuke uno told lawmakers 
monday that political reform is at the top of his agenda governing 
party leaders were reported ready to show their support by quitting 
party factions 
in a major policy speech his first address to parliament since 
becoming prime minister on saturday uno said restoring the 
nations trust in politics is his administrations most pressing 
task 
restoring the peoples faith in politics will strengthen the 
base of peace and prosperity of our country and is indispensible to 
strengthening our world image he said in separate speeches to 
both houses of parliament 
uno took office more than a month after former prime minister 
noboru takeshita announced he would resign to take responsibility 
for the recruit scandal which has sent support for the governing 
liberal democratic party to alltime lows 
our cure must go to the very roots of this affliction so that 
no similar disgrace will ever again occur he said 
uno said his primary aims are to improve political ethics draw 
a clear line between the public and private use of political funds 
and create an election system that does not require tremendous 
funds 
fundraising was a major factor in the scandal named after the 
recruit co a publishing conglomerate that sold underpriced 
unlisted shares in its real estate subsidiary to more than 150 
politicians bureaucrats and businessmen in 1986 
more than a dozen people have been arrested on bribery and other 
charges two politicians were charged with accepting bribes and 
three takeshitaappointed cabinet ministers were forced to step 
down due to recruit ties 
the reform campaign appeared to make progress monday when 
liberal democratic leaders and all cabinet ministers said they 
would resign from factions within the party according to the kyodo 
news service 
party factions which provide formidable voting blocs increase 
the partys appetite for funds because faction leaders need money 
to support the political activities of their followers 
uno who has resigned from the faction formerly headed by 
exprime minister yasuhiro nakasone has vowed to abolish the 
blocs but he was careful to maintain a balance among factions when 
naming his cabinet 
he may think he has demonstrated his will by placing 
political ideals and reform at the top of his speech and with his 
unprecedented wordiness on the subject said an editorial in the 
liberal asahi shimbun japans secondlargest newspaper but the 
speech sounded hollow 
when you are caught in a whirlpool its difficult to see how 
big it is the editorial said referring to the scandal 
analysts and opposition party members regard uno who served as 
takeshitas foreign minister from 1987 as a weak politician and 
doubt he has the power to change japans money politics 
he hasnt made amends for the scandal at all said iwao 
teramae a japan communist party legislator 
on foreign policy uno said fulfilling japans international 
responsibilities is indispensible he indicated he will support 
takeshitas international cooperation initiative which involves 
peacemaking efforts expanding overseas aid programs and 
strengthening international exchange programs 
uno reaffirmed japans dual committment to the advanced 
industrialized nations and to asia and he promised to support 
continuing domestic demandfueled growth as well as improve access 
to japans markets 
now that japan which received the greatest benefit from the 
postwar free trade system has become strong economically it is 
not proper for her to express her own selfcentered positions he 
said

president bush said monday he hopes a new 
united nations deconfrontation plan for cyprus will be the 
prelude to further progress in settling the dispute that has 
divided the island for 15 years

advising them on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
cyprus question 
bush is required by law to submit a bimonthly report on cyprus 
to the speaker of the house and the chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee 
since the last report bush said the uns deconfrontation 
plan went into effect on may 17 greatly alleviating the 
probability of incidents posed by the dangerously close proximity 
of the two sides military units in the nicosia area 
he said the united states had worked hard for the un effort 
and added we are hopeful that this achievement will prove the 
prelude to further progress 
he said the greekcypriot and turkishcypriot sides have 
continued efforts under the auspices of un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to assemble the basic elements of a 
settlement

it in a meeting with turkish prime minister turgut ozal in tokyo in 
february

canada as commander of the un peacekeeping force in cyprus 
cyprus has been divided since turkish troops invaded the 
northern third of the island in 1974 in a move the ankara

the possibility of a conventional arms treaty 
that would cut us troops in europe creates a greater need for 
fast cargo ships to reinforce them in case of war the chairman of 
a senate subcommittee said monday 
president bush last week proposed ceilings on troops tanks 
combat aircraft and attack helicopters artillery and armored 
personnel as part of a revised nato response to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs planned cuts in warsaw pact forces 
if mutual reductions take place in europe american forces 
will be withdrawn across the atlantic while soviet forces will 
remain at the other end of the european rail network sen edward 
kennedy dmass chairman of the senate armed services 
subcommittee on projection forces and regional defense said at a 
hearing of the panel 
in such an environment a robust fast sealift program would be 
a crucial element of continued conventional deterrence in europe 
kennedy said 
but the massachusetts democrat said the biggest gap to 
reinforce nato europe is in fast sealift a complaint that was 
echoed by a series of former and present pentagon officials 
witnesses told the senate committee that us sealift capability 
has suffered as the nations merchant marine has declined and 
annual spending for research and development in shipbuilding has 
decreased from 44 million to 500000 
our long suit is people and technology and were exploiting 
neither in the world today said gen duane h cassidy 
commanderinchief of the us transportation command 
robert costello the pentagons former undersecretary for 
acquisition expressed dismay over japans 60knot cargo ship two 
or three times as fast as conventional ships we dont have 
anything like that on the agenda he said 
bushs proposal would reduce us deployments in europe from 
about 330000 troops to about 275000 the president proposed the 
same ceiling for soviet deployments in eastern european countries 
outside the soviet union

pol pot whose khmer rouge regime was 
blamed for the deaths of more than a million cambodians has asked 
to resign from his last official post a radio report said monday 
some western diplomats expressed doubt that the cambodian 
guerrilla leader was calling it quits 
the khmer rouges clandestine voice of democratic kampuchea 
radio station said sunday that pol pot in a letter dated march 4 
had asked to step down as head of the guerrilla groups high 
institute for national defense 
the khmer rouge defeated cambodias usbacked government in 
april 1975 his regime is blamed for the deaths of more than a 
million cambodians who were killed in purges or who perished during 
a radical campaign to abandon the cities and establish a rural 
communist society 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 ousted the khmer rouge 
and established another communist government the khmer rouge then 
returned to guerrilla warfare 
the broadcast said pol pot addressed the letter to khieu 
samphan who became the khmer rouge chairman in 1985 after pol pot 
announced he had resigned from all major military and political 
posts 
it said pol pot asked for a decision on his request by the 
beginning of june no reason was given for the request but the 
broadcast said pol pot asked to remain with the research institute 
until all the hanoi vietnamese aggressors are driven out of 
cambodia from then on i will cease all my activities in the organs 
of the future state of cambodia 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
i certainly wouldnt take it at face value that he is no longer 
involved in the leadership of the khmer rouge 
they are moving towards negotiations and pol pot is the no 1 
unacceptable figure 
the vietnameseinstalled government and an opposition coalition 
of the khmer rouge supporters of prince norodom sihanouk and 
noncommunist guerrillas have held negotiations on a peace 
settlement and new government 
all parties except the khmer rouge have insisted that pol pot

american oats and oat products can be sold to 
canada without import licenses because the us price support level 
is below canadas the two countries announced monday 
the us support level for oats is 874 percent while in canada 
it is 1109 percent the agriculture department said 
under the free trade agreement signed between the two countries 
last year canada agreed to remove import licensing requirements if 
us support levels were equal to or below those of canada 
supports are government subsidies that put a floor under prices 
the us mechanism for doing this is a pricesupport loan program 
under which farmers use crops as collateral and are free to forfeit 
and keep the money if that nets them a greater return than selling 
on the market 
import licenses will be required for wheat and barley the 
support comparisons for those commodities are wheat 6162 percent 
in the united states and 4628 percent in canada barley 7249 
percent in the united states and 5023 in canada

a divorcee who was told by the state 
supreme court that she cannot let her boyfriend spend the night 
while her three children are home has appealed to the us supreme 
court her lawyer said monday 
carla j parrillos appeal asserts that the state court deprived 
her of a fundamental right to be free from government influence 
within the confines of her own home said patrica a hurst an 
american civil liberties union lawyer 
hurst said the state decision in a case initiated by ms 
parrillos exhusband has affected her clients rights as a parent 
to organize the care and custody of her children and to 
conduct her life as she deems fit 
the fact that the state of rhode island stepped into her home 
to regulate her conduct is something that we all find very 
offensive hurst said at a news conference 
until someone can prove that im harming my children i will 
continue to live my life as i see fit ms parrillo 33 of 
johnston said monday 
the state supreme court upheld a family court decision in march 
saying we see no great constitutional issue in this controversy 
ms parrillos boyfriend may still visit the marital domicile 
overnight with the exception of those times when the children are 
with their mother the court wrote 
hurst had argued that the 1986 decision by family court judge 
william goldberg now retired was based on the judges personal 
opinions on family life 
a transcript of the conversation between the trial justice and 
the children is devoid of any facts which could support the judges 
inference of harm to the children hurst said she added that 
goldberg rejected her request to have an independent psychologist 
examine the children to determine if the overnight visits were 
harming them 
ms parrillo and her husband justin parrillo jr were divorced 
in may 1986 after seven years of marriage and she was given custody 
of her children aged 9 11 and 13 at the time he was given 
visitation rights 
in june the parrillos returned to family court ms parrillo 
wanted her exhusband to see the children away from her home 
parrillo wanted his exwife restrained from having any unrelated 
males stay overnight at her house 
ms parrillo maintained that overnight visits by her boyfriend 
joseph dipippo once or twice a week caused no harm to her 
children she testified that they liked dipippo but she did not 
plan to marry him in the near future 
parrillo felt his children didnt like the situation and 
noticed a change in their behavior according to his attorney 
thomas desimone 
the children told goldberg in a private meeting that they all 
got along well with dipippo although the eldest said there were 
times he did not like the man 
the judge ruled the overnight visits in the presence of the 
children were not conducive to their general wellbeing at least 
in terms of their psychological welfare the high court noted 
goldberg said if ms parrillo married dipippo the issue would 
become moot 
no one gave carla parrillo credit for knowing what was right 
for her kids as a mother said hurst who maintained ms 
parrillos decision to introduce a man to the family slowly was 
easier on the children than an abrupt marriage

parliament adopted a peace plan 
monday that includes public negotiations with eritrean insurgents 
in the presence of an international observer 
the sixpoint proposal approved in a oneday session called by 
president mengistu haile mariam seeks to end a 28year conflict in 
ethiopias northernmost province that is the longest civil war on 
the continent 
public talks with an observer agreed upon by both sides is a 
departure from previous plans the government and rebels have met 
secretly in the past with no apparent progress 
it appeared unlikely that latest proposal would find favor with 
eritrean rebels who control about threefourths of the province 
shewandagne belete chairman of a legislative committee that 
drafted the plan said it was based on the unity and territorial 
integrity of the country 
that was emphasized in the preamble which described the 
conflict as a challenge to the ethiopian entity and the single 
ethiopian identity 
there was no immediate response from the eritrean peoples 
liberation front which is fighting for the independence of the red 
sea province that provides ethiopias only sea outlet 
the government has offered limited autonomy but demands that 
eritrea remain part of ethiopia 
mengistu called the special session less than than three weeks 
after his government crushed a coup attempt among the coup leaders 
was the commander of the 2nd revolutionary army which has borne 
the brunt of fighting in eritrea 
he was was among about a dozen generals slain in the coup 
attempt which mengistu followed with a thorough shakeup of the 
high command 
in 1988 and early this year the army suffered humiliating 
defeats in eritrea and in neighboring tigre province which has its 
own rebel movement 
one western diplomat said privately the generals have lost 
their stomach for the war mengistu is under both internal and 
external pressure to end it 
the soviet union has urged mengistu to seek peace threatening 
to cut off military supplies when the current aid pact expires next 
year moscow provided an estimated 5 billion in the past decade 
most of it in military assistance 
shewandagne told the legislature the government had held nine 
secret meetings with the rebels he did not say when or where the 
meetings took place or whether they were fruitful 
he also confirmed a meeting was held recently in khartoum 
sudan with the eritrean liberation front the first movement to 
take up arms in 1962 it has been pushed out of most of the region 
by the larger peoples liberation front which boycotted the 
khartoum talks 
neither mengistu nor shewandagne mentioned the tigre peoples 
liberation front rebels in tigre say they want only greater 
autonomy for the province not independence

a mayor who feared that divine retribution 
killed three city managers in less than a month has ordered dozens 
of improper prayer scrolls removed from doorjambs in the city hall 
a spokesman said monday 
mayor maxim levy of lod near tel aviv became suspicious of the 
mezuzahs or parchment scrolls traditionally attached to doorjambs 
after the third death may 18 spokesman jack sheetrit said 
all three deaths were from natural causes doctors said and 
none of the circumstances were unusual 
according to talmudic writings affixing a mezuzah helps protect 
believers from harm 
levy asked ultraorthodox rabbis to examine the buildings 111 
scrolls and they discovered faults in 87 that made them improper 
sheetrit told the associated press 
there were all kinds of problems some were only 
photocopies and in others the words of the prayer were wrong he 
said 
the mayor is religious and he believes in the power of the 
mezuzah so he thought the first thing he had to do was change 
them 
according to jewish law a mezuzah must contain certain verses 
from the book of deuteronomy written in square hebrew characters on 
a piece of parchment made from the skin of a clean animal the word 
almighty must be written on the back of the parchment 
the rolled parchment is inserted in a small case which is 
affixed to the right doorjamb 
sheetrit said levy had changed the mezuzahs at the entrance to 
the city hall and on the doorjamb of his office and had ordered 
new scrolls for the rest of the building

if american companies are to remain 
competitive in the commercial rocket launch business the nation 
needs to build more launch pads a department of transportation 
study concludes 
the study released monday by the office of commercial space 
transportation said that most commercial rocket launches to orbit 
must use one of six launch pads at the cape canaveral in florida 
and that the same pads are also in demand by the department of 
defense and by the national aeronautics and space administration 
the single most significant potential constraint affecting the 
commercial use of government launch ranges is the limited number of 
launch pads available the study said 
directors of the eastern space and missile command have made 
significant progress in adapting to a sharply increased demand 
for commercial launch services that followed policy changes after 
the challenger accident the report said but potential commercial 
launch customers many of whom are foreign companies are still 
concerned about us companies being able to launch satellites on 
schedule 
many payload customers have stated that their misgivings about 
flying american are a direct result of past and current us 
government policies the study found 
the study also noted payload owners have expressed skepticism 
about the ability of us launch firms to meet their needs because 
u s launch firms rely on government facilities that are subject 
to government policies it said the customers worry that the 
launch range must accommodate us national security needs which 
will affect the level of support that can be provided to commercial 
launch operations 
the 1986 challenger accident that destroyed a space shuttle and 
killed seven astronauts delayed american space launches for more 
than two years president reagan ordered that commercial payloads 
would no longer be launched on the shuttle and laws were passed to 
encourage establishment of commercial launch services 
there now are at least seven us commercial rocket launch 
companies competing with french chinese and soviet concerns for 
the commercial launch business of the world the french arianespace 
company now launches about half of all commercial satellites the 
study said 
in addition to a shortage of launch pads the department of 
transportation study also found that policies by the air force 
which controls the florida commercial launch pads are not user 
friendly a factor that affects the ability of us companies to 
compete the report also said that air force safety review 
procedures are time consuming and could cause delays and that 
shared launch range facilities such as propellant storage depots 
create delays in preparing for commercial launches

iraq and kuwait expressed hopes for peace 
after the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini but the united 
states and britain said monday that normalizing relations depends 
on ending the extremism he espoused 
iraq irans archenemy had its first official reaction since 
irans revolutionary patriarch died on saturday 
referring to the ceasefire that began last aug 20 after eight 
years of war and to stalled peace talks since then the 
stateowned daily althawra said iraq is looking only for a 
comprehensive peace with iran based on strong relations 
althawra said khomeini was a grudgebearing tyrant and 
commented that iran now is disunited and confused 
other nations that have clashed with iran also made wary 
soundings for better relations 
in london foreign office minister lord glenarthur said britain 
is ready to resume normal relations with iran if the tehran 
government renounces terrorism and violence 
president bush said the united states will review ruptured 
relations with iran as soon as we see some move away from 
oppresssion and extremism but he said he would not make 
overtures to the new government in iran as he was not sure yet 
about the meaning of changes there following khomeinis death 
bush told a news conference monday there is a way for the 
relationship to improve and thats the release of the american 
hostages 
nine americans are among 18 foreign hostages held in lebanon by 
proiranian shiite moslem groups 
in beirut lebanon an estimated 75000 shiite moslem mourners 
staged a farewell parade for khomeini and chanted death to 
america death to the great satan 
the kuwait times echoed a hope expressed by many of irans arab 
neighbors that irans new leadership ends the deadlock in 
negotiations for a peace that will guarantee permanent stability 
in the region 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi eulogized khomeini as a great 
prophet of islam and revolution and a staunch foe of imperialism 
and israel 
but gadhafi writing in a condolence book at the iranian embassy 
in his capital of tripoli said the iraniraq war made a black 
record in the contemporary history of islam the libyan news 
agency reported 
the government of prime minister rajiv gandhi of india declared 
three days of state mourning for khomeini canceling official 
entertainment and ordering flags flown at halfstaff 
gandhi messaged iranian president ali khamenei may the 
iranian people and the bereaved family have courage and fortitude 
to bear this irreparable loss 
pope john paul ii on a visit to helsinki finland sent a 
polite message of condolence and said it is necessary to state 
with great respect and with deep reflection his impact on his 
country and a considerable part of the world he did not 
elaborate 
hundreds of citizens in predominantly moslem turkey phoned 
newspapers to complain about their governments decision to fly 
flags at halfstaff tuesday for khomeinis funeral 
they expressed rage that the flag would be lowered over the tomb 
of kemal ataturk founder of the turkish republic whose 
westernizing reforms turned turkey into a secular state and who was 
frequently attacked by khomeini 
governments of most conservative persian gulf arab states sent 
polite cables of condolences to tehran but refrained from public 
comment on the demise of the man many held responsible for a decade 
of instability in the region 
oman was the only country among the sixnation gulf cooperation 
council alliance to announce it was sending an official delegation 
to attend the funeral on tuesday and to convey the condolences of 
sultan qaboos 
the council groups oman saudi arabia kuwait qatar bahrain 
and the united arab emirates the six countries who were in the 
direct firing line of khomeinis pledge to export his brand of 
fundamentalist islam 
the leadership in saudi arabia had yet to send even a cable of 
condolences to tehran saudi arabia bore a particular grudge 
against khomeini for the repeated attempts to politicize the annual

president bush in an announcement timed to 
mark world environment day said monday the united states is 
banning the import of elephant ivory from all countries 
we do this out of mounting concern for the rapid decline of 
the wild elephant one of natures most majestic creatures he 
said 
if their populations continue to dimish at current rates the 
wild elephant will soon be lost from this earth we urge the 
nations of the world to join us in this ban 
bush said people around the world have become more and more 
concerned about such environmental problems as global warming 
depletion of the ozone layer and mounting waste disposal problems 
but bush said i am optimistic about the future 
the united states has made remarkable progress in cleaning up 
our air and water we have shown what we can do when the will is 
there and we work together the president said 
if we can probe the depths of space and engineer the genetic 
building blocks of life we can surely protect the quality of our 
environment he said 
the united states already bans the import of ivory outside the 
current system of international regulation last month the bush 
administration said it would press for a complete end to 
international trade in ivory 
the population of the african elephant today is estimated as low 
as 400000 compared with 15 million in 1978 because of the 
inroads of poachers killing the animals for their ivory

a federal appeals court refused to close the 
landmark 1954 brown vs board of education desegregation case 
saying the topeka kan school board has failed to carry out fully 
the us supreme courts mandate 
in an opinion published friday but not made available until 
monday the 10th us circuit court of appeals reversed an october 
1986 ruling that could have closed the case that paved the way for 
nationwide school desegregation 
we are convinced that topeka has not sufficiently countered 
the effects of both the momentum of its prebrown segregation and 
its subsequent segregative acts in the 1960s the appeals court 
said the panel also reversed a lower court ruling that the topeka 
school district had not violated title vi of the civil rights act 
of 1964 
in topeka rich jones an attorney representing the parents of 
17 schoolchildren who reopened the case in 1979 said the group was 
vindicated in its contention that the district had not done enough 
to eliminate segregation 
we won we feel that 10 years of work was not in vain 
said jones included in the group was linda brown buckner whose 
maiden name provided the title for the 1954 ruling 
the court noted that neither the topeka school district nor the 
topeka community are actively resisting desegregation and cited the 
national recognition of the districts innovative curriculum 
this active engagement has largely been directed at concerns 
other than desegregation however the appeals court said adding 
that for the most part the topeka school district has exercised 
a form of benign neglect 
the duty imposed by the constitution and articulated in 
numerous cases by the highest court in this land requires more 
the appeals court said 
the court sent the case back to the kansas us district court 
saying that judge richard rogers of topeka erred in requiring the 
plaintiffs to prove intentional discriminatory conduct 
we are convinced that defendants the topeka school board 
failed to meet their burden of proving that the effects of this 
past intentional discrimination have been dissipated the court 
said 
the 35yearold case springs from the landmark us supreme 
court ruling on a class action lawsuit filed by black topeka 
residents against the school district the lawsuit challenged the 
constitutionality of a kansas law authorizing school segregation 
the supreme court ruled in favor of the lawsuit finding that 
separate but equal schools were unconstitutional 
the topeka school district later submitted an integration plan 
which was approved by the us district court in kansas in 1955 
the court called it a goodfaith effort to bring about full 
desegregation in the topeka schools 
but in 1979 the case was revived again by a group of black 
parents who claimed they were members of the original class in the 
1954 case they claimed topeka had failed to desegregate its 
schools and that the topeka school district operates a racially 
segregated school system 
topeka school board chairman curtis hartenberger said the 
boards attorneys were reviewing the decision 
i have been told the findings relate primarily to student 
faculty and staff assignment and that judge rogers findings of 
equality of education curriculum facilities transporation and 
extracurricular activities were not contested he said at a news 
conference

president bush suspended us arms sales to 
china on monday to protest the militarys bloody weekend crackdown 
and called on people around the world to stand symbolically with 
the young chinese demonstrator who braved a column of tanks 
that image i think is going to be with us a long time bush 
told an evening meeting of business executives in a departure from 
a prepared text on education 
earlier at a news conference the president declared that 
chinese leaders must learn its not going to be business as 
usual and accused the beijing government of brutally 
suppressing popular and peaceful demonstrations 
but while announcing sanctions on military sales bush also 
said he would not withdraw the us ambassador take any other 
steps toward severing diplomatic ties or take abrupt actions 
including economic sanctions that could hurt the chinese 
people 
later bush told an audience of the nations top business 
leaders he was haunted by the bravery of that individual that 
stood alone in front of the tanks rolling down the main avenue 
what is it that gives him the courage to stand up in front of 
a column of tanks right there in front of the world bush asked 
all i can say to him wherever he might be and to the people 
around the world is we are and we must stand with him 
network television news broadcasts showed the remarkable 
confrontation of the young man who held up a column of 18 tanks 
for three minutes arguing with the crew of the lead tank he was 
pushed to safety by the crowd and the tanks moved on 
bush also told members of the business rountable that us 
companies should continue to trade with china that he did not 
support a suspension of trade despite the military brutality in 
beijing 
earlier addressing two other international subjects at his news 
conference bush spoke approvingly of a strong showing by 
solidaritybacked candidates in polish elections and said that if 
the iranian government wants to improve relations after the weekend 
death of the ayatollah khomeini it should use its influence to free 
american hostages from lebanon 
he said the events in china the past few days in which hundreds 
of chinese demonstrators were killed and many more wounded as the 
army moved to clear tiananmen square were being followed in horror 
by people around the world 
bush at a hastily called morning news conference said the 
united states would 
immediately suspend military sales to china by the us 
government as well as commercial exports of weapons 
halt visits between us and chinese military leaders 
give sympathetic review to visa extensions for any of the 
40000 chinese students studying in the united states who were 
afraid of returning home 
offer humanitarian and medical aid through the red cross to 
those injured in the assault 
bush held out the possibility of further steps if the situation 
worsens however he said i dont want to see a total break in 
this relationship and i will not encourage a total break in this 
relationship 
he also said keeping an ambassador in beijing provided a good 
listening post 
bushs steps won praise from democratic and republican leaders 
on capitol hill i think there was a general consensus for the 
presidents position house majority leader thomas s foley 
dwash said after a midafternoon meeting among bush and 
congressional leaders at the white house i think hes done the 
right thing 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said there was a welldone feeling from all 
of us we agreed right around the table that it would be incorrect 
to take any precipitous actions that the president was handling it 
just right and accordingly 
senate leaders said they would introduce a bipartisan 
senseofthesenate resolution on tuesday backing the presidents 
moves and condemning the violence in china 
conservative sen jesse helms rnc said bushs actions were 
fine so far however he said stiffer measures including trade 
sanctions and us opposition to further international loans to 
china might be needed if the violence continues 
those students in beijing have played the real china card 
they are demanding freedom and i think they are going to get it 
helms said 
at the state department a spokeswoman said american students in 
beijing were being advised to leave the campuses and gather in 
hotels because of the chaotic situation however the spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said there had been no threats against the 
americans 
the state department also issued a new travel advisory 
cautioning americans not to visit china and it instituted a 
warden system of asking those already there to make their 
presence known to us diplomatic offices 
later monday at a meeting in the oval office bush told a group 
of visiting chinese students weve got to speak out against the 
brutality but somehow make clear that our argument like yours 
is just with those who resort to force not the chinese people 
one of the students jia hao a doctoral candidate in political 
science at george washington university said suspension of 
military sales would encourage the student demonstrators and be a 
big blow for those who are responsible for the massacre those 
butchers of beijing 
some congressional critics have accused bush of waiting too long 
to act in response to the crackdown 
but the president who served as us envoy to china in 197475 
and said he decided his course of action based on his knowledge of 
chinese history defended his pace i dont feel that weve 
waited long when you have a force of this nature and you have 
events of this nature unfolding he said 
on another subject bush said it was still unclear what the 
death over the weekend of iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini might mean for us relations with that islamic nation 
theres a way for the relationship with the united states to 
improve and thats for the release of the american hostages being 
held in lebanon he said 
on still a third international subject bush said the fact that 
candidates backed by the labor union solidarity appeared to be 
winning in the polish elections suggested this message communist 
bureaucrats beware in poland it looks to me like theres quite a 
move moving towards freedom and democracy 
on developments in china bush said i cant begin to fathom 
exactly what led to the order to use force because even as 
recently as a couple of days ago there was evidence that the 
military were under orders not to use force 
bush said halting arms sales is going to send a strong signal 
im not saying its going to cure the shortrange problem in china 
but i think it is very important the chinese leaders know its 
not going to be business as usual 
white house officials said that over 600 million in continuing 
military sales to china would be affected including a 502 
million program to help the chinese upgrade electronics on their 
f8 fighter jets 
also affected are the final two units in a 625 million sale of 
four artillerylocating radars a 285 million program for 
upgrading largecalibre ammunition production and an 85 million 
sale of torpedoes 
more than 700 million in commercial arms sales to china have 
been made since relations were normalized in 1979 including 85 
million last year 
he said he had not talked to chinese leaders directly since the 
violence but had talked to us ambassador james lilley who had 
been in constant touch with them

solidarity won a landslide victory in 
polands most democratic elections in more than 40 years the 
ruling communist party conceded monday dozens of senior officials 
apparently were turned out of parliament 
the astounding admission of defeat two days before the official 
results of sundays voting were to be released came in a statement 
at the start of the evening newscast by party spokesman jan 
bisztyga who was shown sitting at the elbow of solidarity national 
spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz 
a special slate of prominent government officials apparently was 
overwhelmingly rejected by voters 
the results are genuinely unfavorable for the partyled 
coalition bisztyga said the elections had a plebiscite nature 
and solidarity got a decided majority 
he reminded viewers that gen wojciech jaruzelski the countrys 
leader and head of the communist party offered friday to form a 
grand coalition after the election with the opposition 
the first step of the opposition toward this is joint concern 
about order in the country said bisztyga 
it appeared possible that at least some government ministries 
might be offered to solidarity the free trade union movement 
shunned such offers in the past saying it prefers to remain in 
opposition 
however solidarity was not emphatically ruling it out monday 
solidaritys participation in a grand coalition would require 
more talks said senior union adviser bronislaw geremek 
he said no proposal had been forwarded so far 
despite solidaritys win the communists still are expected to 
retain control of parliament because election rules guarantee it a 
majority of seats 
but the union said solidarity won almost all seats it was 
allowed to compete for indicating the opposition may have veto 
power in the twochamber legislature 
the communist partys immediate concern seemed to be in 
maintaining public calm 
if feelings of triumph and adventurism cause anarchy in 
poland democracy and social peace will be seriously threatened 
authorities the coalition and the opposition cannot allow such a 
situation bisztyga said 
solidarity leader lech walesa said earlier monday in gdansk 
its too early for congratulations and we dont have complete 
information yet 
but the official pap news agency on monday night confirmed 
overwhelming solidarity victories in at least 11 cities 
only a few solidarity candidates to the new 100seat senate 
appeared unsure of firstround victory onyszkiewicz told an 
afternoon news conference indicating firm opposition control of 
the east blocs first freely chosen legislative chamber 
under the historic accords between the solidarityled opposition 
and the communist government all 100 seats in the senate were up 
for grabs in sundays balloting 
the opposition also was allowed to run for 161 seats or 35 
percent in the 460seat sejm the lower chamber the rest of the 
seats were reserved for the ruling communists and their allies 
thirtyfive of those reserved seats are for prominent government 
and party officials who face no challengers 
but those uncontested party candidates must win 50 percent of 
the vote to be seated and there were widespread reports voters 
were overwhelming rejecting those candidates 
if solidarity wins all of its seats in both chambers it would 
have 261 seats and the party would have 299 if all 35 unopposed 
candidates are rejected the party would still have a 264261 edge 
in the legislature 
however under the newly revamped constitution the senate has 
veto power over all legislation passed by parliament the veto can 
only be overridden by a twothirds vote in the sejm 
if solidaritys projections match the final official returns 
the communist party and its allies would be at least 10 votes short 
of being able to override a veto by an oppositiondominated senate 
the 35member national list of prominent candidates includes 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski interior minister czeslaw 
kiszczak no 2 in the politburo jozef czyrek and official unions 
leader alfred miodowicz 
all would retain their regular party posts if defeated in 
parliament 
solidarity leaders were hoping at least some on the list would 
survive 
if the 35 seats were vacant the opposition would be in a 
stronger position when the sejm and senate meet jointly next month 
to elect a president 
solidarity has not determined who if anyone it will support 
for the new office of president which will have control of the 
armed forces and be able to call parliamentary elections the party 
plans to nominate jaruzelski 
walesa on saturday went on national television to announce that 
he was voting for 34 of the 35 people on the national list 
but many voters apparently saw it as a chance to express 
displeasure at the poor economy and the past behavior of the party 
about 16 million poles cast ballots a turnout of about 62 
percent 
a runoff election is to be held june 18 in those contested races 
where no candidate obtained more than 50 percent of the votes but 
it appeared that the runoffs would be mainly for seats in the sejm 
reserved for the party and its allies

the man who introduced pat swindall to an 
undercover agent testified monday that the former congressman knew 
money laundering was involved in an 850000 loan deal involving 
the three men 
mr swindall told me he didnt give a damn where the money 
came from charles lechasney said during swindalls federal 
perjury trial 
swindall is accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his 
1987 dealings with lechasney a political associate and internal 
revenue service agent mike mullaney who was posing as money broker 
mike martinez 
swindall was seeking money to finish building his suburban 
atlanta home 
in his second day on the stand lechasney said that on sept 14 
1987 when the deal was discussed in swindalls presence the 
defendant indicated he understood money laundering was involved 
the prosecution witness said swindall told him the deal was a 
good way for mullaney and his clients purportedly drug kingpins 
to wash the money 
lechasney said he discussed with swindall how he would handle 
the 850000 in such a way that we would not be caught 
violating moneylaundering laws 
lechasney an admitted con man who has been convicted of money 
laundering testified that he became concerned after mullaney 
suggested swindall meet with his boss raul another undercover 
agent 
the witness said he urged swindall to tell mike he could not 
launder his money swindall followed that advice on sept 26 
1987 when the deal fell through lechasney said 
the day before swindall signed papers arranging for a 150000 
advance on the 850000 loan from lechasneys gulf coast mortgage 
corp according to documents entered as evidence monday 
swindalls attorney has called the 150000 a separate loan but 
lechasney said monday the terms were those outlined in his 
discussions with swindall and mullaney 
the 150000 check swindall received from lechasneys attorney 
was backed by a personal check from lechasney to the lawyer with 
the understanding that mullaney would make the check good the 
witness said 
swindall attorney richard hendrix began crossexamining 
lechasney late monday afternoon attacking the witnesss history of 
fraud and deceit 
lechasney said he has never lied under oath in court but 
conceded he was an accomplished liar in attempts to influence 
others he said he told mullaney and a government informant that he 
had extensive political and diplomatic connections and was 
executive producer of the hit films urban cowboy and 
romancing the stone among other falsehoods 
swindalls attorneys have indicated they will seek to prove 
lechasney is a sociopathic liar who deceived the government 
into thinking swindall was a crook and tricked the congressman into 
thinking the money deal was ok 
swindall a twoterm republican lost his 4th congressional 
district seat to democrat ben jones last november 
if convicted of all 10 counts against him swindall faces a 
maximum sentence of 50 years in prison

an airline ticket agent pleaded to be 
reinstated in his job just hours before he opened fire aboard an 
airliner carrying the boss who fired him killing all 43 aboard an 
fbi agent testified monday 
special agent alan hawkins told a superior court jury that 
former usair ticket agent david a burke confessed to his 
supervisor that he had a drug and alcohol problem but wanted the 
airline to rehire him 
but supervisor raymond thomson refused to rehire burke because 
of theft allegations hawkins said shortly thereafter the two 
boarded pacific southwest airlines flight 1771 in los angeles on 
dec 7 1987 bound for san francisco 
investigators believe that after the plane took off burke shot 
thomson with a handgun he had smuggled on board burke then stormed 
the cockpit shot the pilot and copilot and their slumping bodies 
sent the plane into a steep fatal dive 
the testimony came in the second week of a multimilliondollar 
lawsuit focusing on how burke was able to pass through a security 
checkpoint armed with a 44caliber magnum 
the owner of the ranch where the plane went down and the 
survivors of seven passengers and two crew members claim the 
security measures were faulty the defendants psa usair the 
citys department of airports and ogden allied security co hold 
burke alone responsible and have filed a countersuit 
ronald wecht an attorney for the plaintiffs said burke also 
bought a 350000 insurance policy from a vending machine before 
boarding the flight 
burke a 16year employee approached the psa passenger 
screening station at los angeles international airport wearing an 
invalid badge said gerald sterns a member of the legal team 
representing plaintiffs in 35 cases consolidated for the trial 
sterns said security should have checked to see whether the 
badge burke was wearing was current and since burke was not in 
uniform he should have been searched 
but none of this was done sterns said she just says 
have a nice day and he replies ill have a very nice day 
the next thing we know he turns up back on the public side 
of the checkpoint sterns said 
thats when burke talked to his former boss thomson pleading 
for his old job as a usair ticket agent thomson 48 a station 
manager for usair the company that bought psa took six pages of 
notes during the 30minute meeting with burke 
after his unsuccessful attempt to regain his former post the 
35yearold burke stopped by a psa passenger counter where he 
bought a ticket according to court documents 
investigators believe that about 30 minutes after the plane took 
off burke handed thomson a note scribbled on an airsickness bag 
the note said hi ray i think its sort of ironical that we 
ended up like this i asked for some leniency for my family 
remember well i got none and youll get none 
all on board were killed as the fourengine plane slammed nose 
first mph into the rugged coastal backcountry of san luis obispo 
county

the trespass trial of 155 antiabortion 
activists opened under the glare of floodlights monday with 
potential jurors and defendants sitting in a theater because no 
courtroom could hold all of them 
hillsborough county judge james d arnold consolidated the cases 
and rented the 300seat jaeb theater at the tampa performing arts 
complex for what is expected to be a weeklong trial 
arnold sat center stage at a makeshift judges bench while the 
95 prospective jurors occupied the first five rows the defendants 
took up the orchestra mezzanine and balcony seats of the theater 
designed as an intimate hall for nightclub acts and jazz ensembles 
prosecutors say the defendants broke the law april 15 when they 
tried to disrupt operations at the womens health center about 
1200 people organized by operation rescue an antiabortion group 
demonstrated at the clinic 
more than 180 were arrested and charged with trespass after 
warning a misdemeanor that carries a possibile maximum sentence of 
one year in prison and a 1000 fine some pleaded no contest in a 
deal with prosecutors and received six months probation the rest 
opted for trial 
jury candidates were bused to the arts complex attorneys 
expected to take all day to seat a sixmember jury 
outside four demonstrators representing both sides of the issue 
picketed peacefully 
the judge ruled earlier that the defendants wouldnt be allowed 
to argue that any trespass was justified and excusable because they 
were saving lives 
defense attorney gregory boyer had hoped to present what he said 
was evidence that many women arriving at the center on april 15 
were scheduled to have abortions and that most women deterred 
once are less likely to follow through with a second appointment 
he said the defense has been used in jury trials in similar cases 
elsewhere 
but arnold agreed with prosecutors that because abortion is 
legal in florida and a firsttrimester fetus is not considered a 
viable baby the defense is irrevelant and would become an 
emotional plea to jurors

voyager 2 began taking pictures monday 
of neptune the last planet the space probe will encounter since it 
was launched nearly 12 years ago on a spectacular tour of the solar 
system nasa officials said 
the spacecraft still is about 73 million miles from the planet 
about the distance from earth to the planet mercury said ellis 
miner voyager deputy project scientist at the jet propulsion 
laboratory 
but even at such distances miner said the electronic 
picturetaking equipment aboard voyager 2 can provide more detail 
and clarity than anything available on earth 
each new picture gives us new information miner said the 
probe is taking about six images every three hours as it approaches 
the planet at roughly 37200 miles per hour 
were seeing a lot of detail on the atmosphere that we really 
hadnt anticipated miner said 
enthusiastic members of voyagers imaging team already are 
speculating that the findings will be more exciting than the images 
of jupiter where voyager cameras discovered extraterrestrial 
volcanoes on io a moon 
on aug 6th voyager 2 begins its closeencounter phase and the 
probes closest approach is scheduled for aug 24 when it will 
pass within 3000 miles of the planet 
the first images were being recorded by the spacecrafts tape 
recorders and will be played back tuesday at the jpl laboratory 
operated under contract by the california institute of technology 
for the national aeronautics and space administration 
the probe now is so far away more than 26 billion miles that 
data radioed at the speed of light take nearly four hours to reach 
earth jpl officials said 
voyager 2 and its sister space probe voyager 1 were launched 
within weeks of each other in the summer of 1977 in what has proved 
to be one of the most successful data gathering efforts from deep 
space 
they are the two most complex spacecraft missions that we have 
launched to date miner said its been a truly amazing journey 
that the two have had 
voyager 1 was directed to make an extraordinary flyby of 
saturn which threw the space probe above the plane of the planets 
and made it impossible to visit any more of the solar systems 
outer planets 
voyager 2 however sailed on to uranus in 1986 where it 
observed 10 new moons measured the planets rotation and took 
pictures of major portions of the planet and its moons 
in addition to taking images of the planet voyager 2 also will 
be measuring ultraviolet radiation and searching for escaping gases 
and activity similar to earths aurora borealis and australis

us trade with china and stopping us investment in chinas

strong action to ensure the protection of american citizens as well 
as expressing at the highest level our deep concern our anguish 
over further loss of life foley said

the search for ways to predict some of 
natures most unpredictable rampages is examined in a new 
documentary wednesday in the pbs series the infinite voyage 
the special living with disaster looks at hurricanes 
tornadoes volcanoes earthquakes and a recently discovered 
atmospheric phenomenon the microburst which has knocked airliners 
out of the sky 
in central california dr allen lindh a seismologist with the 
us geological survey is working on a program to predict the next 
major earthquake 
in denver dr wayne sand is helping to develop computer 
software for a radar that will warn air traffic controllers and 
pilots of a microburst 
we cant control these natural forces said producer gail 
willumsen but through scientific research we are learning how to 
better predict disasters and live through them 
living with disaster is tied in with the international 
decade for natural disaster reduction which begins in 1990 the 
united nations proclaimed the observance to recognize scientific 
and technological advances that help save lives and lessen property 
damage 
the show the eighth in the infinite voyage series was 
produced by wqedtv pittsburgh it will be shown next week on some 
commercial stations and on cable 
the area around parkfield calif along the san andreas fault 
is one of the most closely monitored earthquake areas in the world 
hundreds of sensors measure earth movement and lasers calculate 
any shift in the fault the seismologists expect an earthquake in 
the parkfield area measuring 60 on the richter scale sometime in 
the next year or two the last five earthquakes there have been in 
that range 
all the data is fed into computers that give us precise 
information on small earthquakes in the area said lindh we 
know that parkfield earthquakes in 1934 and 1966 were preceded by 
foreshock sequences were monitoring the area looking for 
foreshocks our first line of defense is to identify these 
foreshocks as they occur that will give us an indication that the 
main event is about to occur 
lindh said as yet they could not predict the next great 
earthquake were at the stage of learning to crawl before we 
walk he said our focus now is on parkfield after that we 
can evaluate whether gearing up for a major earthquake in southern 
california is justified 
the microburst also known as windshear or divergent wind flow 
has been recognized as a hazard to aviation for only about 10 
years said sand the flows develop beneath thunderstorms they are 
known to have caused airliner crashes in new orleans and dallas and 
are a possible cause of several crashes since the late 1960s 
the microbursts form rapidly but the computer software weve 
developed to detect these events looks for precursors that give us 
a warning said sand deputy manager for the research 
applications program at the national center for atmospheric 
research at denvers stapleton airport you can anticipate them 
to some degree 
sand said the downward flow of air beneath a thunderstorm hits 
the earth and sprays out in all directions like a garden hose 
spraying water on a sidewalk an airplane flying through this would 
hit sudden headwinds followed by a downdraft followed by 
tailwinds 
an event in denver last summer showed a difference of 80 knots 
in the wind speed as it changed direction 180 degrees sand said 
the documentary also looks at sea erosion at ocean city md 
where dr stephen leatherman a coastal geologist with the 
university of maryland says condominium buildings in the resort 
could be under water in less than 11 years 
the death and destruction from the earthquake in soviet armenia 
were due largely to poor building design and construction 
according to dr peter yanev who was a member of the national 
academy of sciences delegation that reached armenia within days of 
the great quake he warns that similar construction is found in 
such earthquakeprone cities in this country as boston and salt 
lake city

when president bush was asked whether his 
journey to the western summit was his greatest political triumph 
he smiled and said no without an instants hesitation 
was it his election to be president now were talking bush 
said relaxed and satisfied as air force one neared the runway 
friday ending his weeklong diplomatic mission he called it a 
triumph for the western alliance and for western values 
it had been his best week since the inauguration now the 
challenge is to make it last the successes that heartened bush and 
his high command are preliminary 
proposals are not achievements and the agenda already has 
changed posting a new challenge what was to have been a series of 
leadership briefings on nato turned instead from last weeks 
success to this weeks crisis the savage chinese crackdown on 
protesters demanding democracy 
still there are points in any political career at which one 
turn can alter the whole plot 
for bush one came in the summer of 1980 when ronald reagan put 
him on the ticket after an improbable miniboom for former 
president gerald r ford as vice president 
there was another in the winter of 1988 when bush his 
presidential candidacy in trouble turned it around with victory in 
the new hampshire presidential primary 
europe 89 could become that kind of landmark in the bush 
presidency theres a lot to be done first but bush did get one 
immediate dividend he came home to altered perceptions of his 
leadership 
he went to the nato summit at brussels under fire at home from 
critics who said he was too slow and too timid in dealing with the 
peace offensive of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
at nato bush launched his own and the allies unanimously 
embraced it he proposed sharp cutbacks in conventional forces and 
he said it ought to be done by 1992 or 1993 
in addition the administration engineered an alliance 
compromise on the timetable for negotiations for cutbacks in 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
all this cast bush as a decisive leader of the alliance he 
said it showed the way he intends to lead the free world in short 
order he seemed to have overcome a springtime of criticism over 
style pace and proposals 
bush had commissioned a foreign policy review that dragged well 
into may and followed it with a series of four foreign policy 
speeches that were intended to describe his vision but were long on 
rhetoric and philosophy short on proposals 
white house chief of staff john sununu said those speeches were 
an essential part of the bush plan he said they were written to 
send signals to europe east and west and to the soviet union 
it was a hard time for us to go through and make sure we did that 
part right and keep hearing that nothing was happening sununu 
said 
brent scowcroft the national security adviser said bush was 
determined to make all his proposals on europe at brussels rather 
than have them disclosed in advance and made into a fait accompli 
fortunately it all came together right sununu said 
at least for openers theres still a long course to cover bush 
said he will press the us and nato bureaucracies to swiftly 
convert the ideas into a package that can be put before the soviet 
union when the conventional weapons talks resume in vienna on sept 
7 
thats a challenge the weapons bush proposals to curb must be 
defined in treaty terms the united states and the soviet union both 
can accept moscow already is talking about including some things 
nato omits there also is likely to be a demand that cutbacks 
include us navy forces 
scowcroft said verification of the proposed cuts will be a 
problem but should be manageable 
so far what has happened is that the president has gained nato 
endorsement of his plan to cut about 30000 us troops in nato if 
the soviets will withdraw ten times that many thats a deal no 
ally would be likely to refuse even if nato were in the habit of 
rebuffing american presidents 
the hard part comes at the bargaining table with soviet 
negotiators nothing goes on the arms control scoreboard unless 
theres a deal there 
nevertheless bush already has scored politically this 
helps sununu said were going to try to take full advantage 
of it 
thats been done before nothing perks up a presidency like a 
successful foreign mission were not going to turn out backs on 
any timehonored successful techniques sununu said

despite a supreme court guarantee that us 
prisoners receive medical care many still clamor for improvement 
they say treatment remains inadequate sometimes slipshod largely 
because good doctors steer clear of their grimly crowded padlocked 
societies the court guarantee has been further dulled by two 
developments no justices could have foreseen the onslaught of aids 
and the graying of the prison population people should not go to 
prison to die for lack of health care were better than that as a 
country says inmates advocate william rold this is the first 
story in a threepart ap extra series medicine behind bars 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
medicine behind bars begins with the fundamental 
paradox of caring for misfits banished by a society that could care 
less about their wellbeing 
add a heap of more specific problems and the provision of health 
care in prisons becomes a constant struggle 
doctors and nurses in great demand in the outside world must 
be recruited to work for civil service wages in steelbar 
surroundings a federal program that helped in this search the 
national health service corps which allowed doctors to pay off 
school loans by working in prisons was dismantled by the reagan 
administration 
the patients are murderers rapists drug dealers and thieves 
who bring a hodgepodge of untreated ailments into prison 
overcrowded cellblocks sizzle with the fear of aids as well as 
tuberculosis and other contagious diseases prisons are being 
forced to open costly geriatric units to treat chronic heart lung 
and other conditions of graying inmates 
and the source of relief for many other societal ills the state 
lawmaker has been more likely to dole out condemnation than 
compassion for criminals who cant vote 
inmates advocates say quality medical care in prisons is 
elusive despite court orders national guidelines and more money 
grudgingly given 
theres a general contradiction in providing health services 
and locking people up in steel cages prisons deform everybody 
said robert cohen former medical director at new york citys 
rikers island prison and an expert medical witness in healthcare 
suits 
added armond start medical director of the wisconsin prison 
system prisons are the most antitherapeutic places there are 
too most americans feel indifferent about prisoners rights 
prisoners are a pariah kind of constituency said edward 
koren of the american civil liberties union we treat them like 
garbage you leave it outside in the trash can and dont want to 
see it again nobody cares unless it comes back again 
said minnesota inmate henry jackson a 69yearold sex offender 
who has diabetes and high blood pressure were just dogs were 
nothing 
medical care however is a legal obligation 
a 1976 supreme court ruling said deliberate indifference to 
serious medical problems of inmates constitutes cruel and unusual 
punishment it made prisoners the only class of us citizen 
guaranteed health care by the government 
but having the right to care doesnt guarantee mayo clinicstyle 
treatment because no federal or state authority has spelled out 
what constitutes adequate medical care quality is a matter of 
court interpretation since 1982 only 10 percent of the nations 
600 prisons have met voluntary guidelines set by health 
professionals 
the following court cases are all based on prison care provided 
since the guidelines were issued 
six inmates died at a pittsburgh prison in the last two years 
after getting appalling shocking and dangerously inadequate 
medical care according to cohen who testified in may in a federal 
case brought by several inmates cohen said an aidsafflicted 
prisoner died of pneumonia a diabetic from lack of insulin the 
other deaths are alleged to have resulted from improper diagnosis 
and treatment of heart attacks and cancer 
at minnesotas stillwater prison onethird of the 1200 
inmates and at least five guards were infected with tuberculosis 
from 1982 through 1986 the first case wasnt diagnosed until six 
months after the inmate went to sick call and officials waited two 
years after inmates filed suit to test the prison for the airborne 
germ 
a 25yearold convict died in may 1987 during an asthma attack 
at deer island house of corrections a precivil war lockup near 
boston according to a current wrongful death suit the man was 
turned away from the infirmary at the 8 pm lockup and the guards 
who dragged him to his cell ignored agony so intense that the 
inmate urinated as he was hauled up three flights of stairs 
hospitalized inmates from rikers island were shackled to bed 
frames and watched by guards until 20 months ago they included 
aids patients pregnant women and inmates on life support systems 
they were too ill to get out of bed much less get out of the 
building said dale wilker of the prisoners rights project which 
sued to have the shackles unlocked 
at new yorks bedford hills correctional facility for women 
several patients had to be hospitalized because dentist donald 
collings drill slipped in their mouths while he was drunk 
according to a 1984 suit filed by the prisoners rights project 
collings resigned and the state paid damages of 650000 
medical care remains a favorite target of lawsuits filed by us 
inmates who totaled a record 627402 in january 
courts have ordered eight states and puerto rico to improve 
prison health care throughout their systems and are demanding 
corrective action at individual prisons in 30 other states 
lawsuits are pending in five states according to the aclu 
still there is unanimous agreement that prison medical care has 
been bettered since courts prescribed legal remedies 
robert brutsche who served 19 years as medical director of the 
federal bureau of prisons before retiring in 1988 said care had 
improved by light years the changes are like night and day 
one indication of progress is funding 
the states spent 80 million on prison health care in 1975 and 
215 million in 1980 according to a 50state survey by the 
associated press the healthcare costs this year will be about 1 
billion or about 8 percent of the 16 billion tab it costs to 
house inmates according to national estimates 
michigan spends the most of any state an average of 758 per 
day for prison health care according to corrections yearbook 
hawaii spends the least 114 the national average is 357 
the tide of reform began 15 years ago when federal judge frank 
johnson found barbarous and shocking conditions in alabama 
and for the first time placed an entire state system under federal 
control 
johnson said unsupervised prisoners without formal training 
regularly pull teeth screen sickcall patients dispense as well 
as administer medication give injections take xrays suture and 
perform minor surgery 
the conditions which inmates attorney matthew myers called 
symptomatic of a national crisis included these atrocities 
a quadriplegics bedsores developed into open wounds and were 
infested with maggots his bandages werent changed in the month 
before his death 
an inmate who was supposed to get intravenous feeding received 
no nourishment for three days before his death 
an inmate whod had a stroke was forced to sit on a bench so he 
wouldnt dirty his bed but he fell so frequently his legs became 
swollen and crippled and he died a day after one leg was amputated

one problem alabama shared with other states was allowing 
doctors to practice on inmates even when not licensed to treat the 
public it was the first state to hire a private company that used 
fully licensed doctors to provide medical care in its prisons now 
all or part of care in 29 states comes from private providers 
the norm 15 years ago was a brokendown doctor with an 
institutional license someone who couldnt practice on the outside 
because he was too old too sick or an alcoholic said dr jay 
anno of the national commission on correctional health care 
about the same time the courts began correcting ills health 
groups were seeking reform reacting to conditions exposed by 
several prison disorders including the 1971 riot at attica ny 
what evolved was the national commission on correctional health 
care which determined 71 minimum things prisons should provide 
about 60 prisons have met the standards since 1982 
the guidelines include medical screening of all incoming 
inmates daily access to sick call 24hour nursing care for 
inpatients and requiring uniform licensing and regulation of 
doctors nurses and other staff 
while most states now assure their prison physicians are 
properly licensed problems with doctors persist 
in the hiring competition many prisons turn to doctors from 
foreign medical schools who struggle with english 
that doesnt necessarily mean theyre quacks their english is 
terrible and they have a hard time communicating said william 
rold of the prisoners rights project in new york 
doctors in prison may also be treating ailments for which they 
have no training in the 1970s a gynecologist did dental exams at 
bedford hills the prisoners rights project said in another new 
york prison a pathologist practiced general medicine and a 
pediatrician served as an internist 
salaries are one of the biggest barriers to attracting doctors 
hawaii for example pays prison doctors 35000 a year about 
half what they could earn outside onethird of the nursing slots 
in hawaiis prisons are unfilled 
what doctor in his right mind would want to practice medicine 
for civilservice pay under harsh conditions for a group of 
patients that doesnt like or trust him said curtis prout 
director of the internship program at harvard medical school 
added dr ronald shansky medical director of the illinois 
prison system no one goes to medical school and says boy when 
i get out im going to go to a prison and make my mark

it was bad enough antti haavisto 
coughed up blood in his prison cell all night he also had to 
listen to death threats from neighboring inmates kept sleepless by 
the diseased mans ceaseless hacking 
hurry up and die convicts snarled through the steel bars 
inside stillwater prison in eastern minnesota shut up or well 
shut you up 
haavistos lungs were being consumed by tuberculosis which 
remained undiagnosed through 11 visits to sick call over six months 
in 1982 prison doctors failed to spot the tb on two xrays 
although haavisto was coughing up sputum with the consistency of 
sludge the doctors told him he had emphysema or pneumonia and gave 
him cough drops to ease the hacking 
i thought i was going to die i couldnt get air in and i 
couldnt cough that mud out i almost drowned twice said the 
wheezing haavisto a finnish immigrant convicted of manslaughter 
before id go to eat i tried to cough up enough stuff so i 
didnt bother anyone i was afraid they would hate me and beat me 
up haavisto 64 said in an interview 
even after haavisto was diagnosed and released from prison in 
may 1983 the airborne germ stalked the stillwater cellblocks 
one year after haavistos diagnosis the prisoner in the next 
cell came down with tb an outbreak occurred in 1984 when inmates 
sued the prison for deficient medical care and another rash of 
infections hit in 1986 when the entire prison was finally tested 
ultimately onethird of the 1200 inmates and at least five 
guards were infected 
tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease once known as 
consumption because it eats away lung tissue scientists estimate 
10 million americans are infected but the vast majority will never 
get the disease 
tb is far worse in crowded prisons lawyers and inmate advocates 
say tb outbreaks show what can happen when a contagious disease 
infects a closed environment with antiquated ventilation systems 
and inattentive medical watchdogs 
the incidence of tb among prisoners is more than triple the rate 
of those not in jail according to a may report by the federal 
centers for disease control in new jersey the rate is 11 times 
higher for inmates in california six times higher new york 
prisons had a sevenfold increase in the disease in the 10year 
period ending in 1986 
the cdc recommended these corrective measures for prisons tb 
tests at least once a year quick xrays for inmates showing 
symptoms and isolation of those infected 
in minnesota federal judge diana murphy said the handling of 
the epidemic by prison officials and the state department of health 
evidenced a lack of care or reckless disregard for the medical 
needs of inmates 
in january five years after the lawsuit was filed she ruled 
that conditions had improved and there was no need to order 
corrective actions 
nevertheless she severely criticized prison administrators 
saying they passed off responsibility to department of health 
which assigned reponsibility to the doctors who denied any role in 
managing the crisis other than providing primary care 
it was a shocking case of negligence said stephen miles of 
the university of chicagos center for clinical medical ethics 
prisoners were not only incarcerated but negligently exposed to a 
contagious disease 
the prison became a pest hole of tuberculosis infection not 
only was there neglect prison officials turned a blind eye to 
known facts there was recklessness said arlo vandevegte 
attorney for the inmates who sued the state 
haavisto apparently brought the tb with him into stillwater on 
his trips to sick call he even suggested the medical staff check 
for tb 
i told them i think i got some real bad problem i couldnt 
talk i couldnt even make a phone call it was so bad haavisto 
said i said i got to get out of this hole or im going to die in 
here 
inmate tony degidio contracted tb during the epidemic his 
father caught it when he came to the prison to visit tony 
youre trapped you dont have a way out degidio said we 
used to tell the guards to do something this guys got a problem 
treat it or were going to treat it our way eliminate him 
prison officials say treatment and tracking have improved 
we dont have those problems now said leroy siegel 
executive assistant to stillwaters warden we responded the way 
the socalled experts told us to

take a population rejected by society for its 
misdeeds then look the other way when a killer virus takes hold 
and the afflicted complain about cruel treatment and deficient 
medical care thats the impact of aids in prison prisoners are 
regarded as people who dont matter its a double stigma for 
inmates with aids said nick fruedenberg a new york expert on 
aids counseling and education the second story in a threepart ap 
extra series medicine behind bars addresses care and 
treatment of inmates with aids 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
carmen harris isolated with other female 
alabama prisoners carrying the aids virus feared she would bleed 
to death in her cell 
stitches from routine uterine surgery had torn open but nurses 
on three shifts failed to answer her pleas for help in november 
1987 she said 
they was afraid of the blood they was afraid of catching the 
virus they had a fear of the word aids said ms harris who 
waited 12 hours before she was taken to a hospital near montgomery 
youre treated like an alien like you had the plague she 
said i got sentenced for manslaughter the judge could have just 
as well sentenced me to death row its like being punished for my 
crime and my diagnosis 
behind prison walls aids is a crackling health issue 
some states isolate inmates who have the virus even if they 
havent developed symptoms those in segregation consider it cruel 
confinement to a new death row prison officials defend it as a way 
to contain the virus and protect those infected from harm 
while arguments can be made for segregation nothing excuses the 
failure to provide medical care inmates advocates say yet 
prisons arent equipped to treat the longterm debilitating 
illnesses wrought by aids 
those on the new death row are not getting appropriate medical 
attention they are being condemned to waste away said benjamin 
schatz director of the aids civil rights project of the national 
gay rights advocates they are treated as if infection indicates 
they have done something wrong 
aids has made the job of providing prison health care more 
difficult more hazardous and more expensive said curtis prout 
director of the internship program at harvard medical school 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most commonly transmitted 
during homosexual acts and the sharing of contaminated needles 
while injecting drugs two behaviors common among prisoners 
in the most recent count last october 3136 aids cases had been 
diagnosed among the us prison population of more than 627000 
according to the national institute of justice aids in prison 
increased 60 percent last year as against a 76 percent jump in the 
general population which can pursue highrisk behaviors more 
freely 
alabama and five other states california georgia nevada 
tennessee and wyoming segregate prisoners who carry the hiv virus 
that causes aids whether or not they have the disease 
prisoners with fullblown aids are segregated in 20 other 
states and 14 states test or will soon start testing all incoming 
inmates for the disease 
federal prisons randomly test 10 percent of incoming inmates and 
all those leaving the system those with aids or the virus are not 
isolated 
mandatory mass screening and segregation of all hivpositive 
inmates is opposed by the national commission on correctional 
health care which sets voluntary standards for health care in 
prisons it favors solutions such as education and changing 
behaviors that cause aids 
alabama inmates who tested positive to the aids virus have 
charged in a class action lawsuit that they receive poor medical 
care and cruel treatment the federal trial began in march 
suits are pending in two other states that segregate inmates 
with aids in connecticut say their medical care is grossly 
inadequate california prisoners assert that the level of their 
medical and psychiatric care is atrocious 
theyre treated like lepers they might as well be wearing a 
scarlet letter theyre shunned ostracized and stigmatized said 
alexa freeman an attorney with the american civil liberties union 
which filed the alabama suit 
there is no logic no rational basis and no medical basis to 
the segregation policy said robert cohen former medical 
director at new york citys rikers island prison and an expert 
medical witness it is only fear and discrimination which gives 
rise to such barbarous actions 
of the 12000 inmates in alabama 138 have tested positive for 
hiv since 1987 all but eight are men 
men are segregated at the limestone correctional facility inside 
dorm 7 where even the exercise yard is cut off from the main yard 
by a 14foothigh chainlink fence topped with razor wire 
the sense of doom is so heavy that inmates call it thunder dorm 
recalling the futuristic city in mad max beyond thunderdome a 
movie about societys collapse after a nuclear holocaust 
inmates eat with wooden ice cream sticks instead of forks and 
spoons meals come on colorcoded trays their dirty laundry goes 
out in red plastic bags so it is washed separately 
they worship apart from other inmates and dont have equal 
access to programs that would allow them to have jobs or earn early 
parole 
one inmate with the virus was forced to mop the halls behind him 
as he walked others were given surgical masks and made to clean 
telephones with bleach or ammonia swabs after making calls 
the same hysteria on the streets is multiplied in prison 
said alvin bronstein of the aclu 
michael marsh 41 a thief said life in thunder dorm features 
fights knifings and highrisk sex among prisoners who figure 
theyre going to die anyway 
guys would rather be killed here than die from aids they 
hunger for death another way any other way something that would 
be honorable marsh said its like living in the valley of the 
shadow of death if aids dont kill you one of the guys might 
some inmates want to keep the hiv prisoners isolated saying 
those infected would be killed as soon as they got into the 
yard 
its either we take them out or they take us out said 
stewart hughey 28 a rapist who testified in favor of segregation 
in the alabama case if one of them gets his semen or blood on an 
open cut they just signed your death warrant 
in new york state where aids is the leading cause of death 
among inmates medical care is deficient according to an 18month 
study released last year by the correctional association of new 
york 
doctors were unfamiliar with aids treatment and detection the 
study said since 1981 more than 500 prisoners have died of aids 
in 25 percent of the cases the disease was not diagnosed until an 
autopsy 
prisoners with aids also have an unusually low survival rate 
the report said 
inmates from new york city who got the disease from dirty 
needles had a mean survival rate of 159 days half that of those in 
the outside community with similar backgrounds 
aids and prison is proving to be a devastating combination 
said cathy potler author of the report imprisonment becomes a 
virtual death sentence

state and federal prisons already straining to 
meet the courtordered medical needs of record numbers of inmates 
face the costly new problem of geriatrics the growing population 
of those graying behind bars requires longterm care special diets 
and treatment for failing eyes and teeth some prisons have 
geriatric units but as one new jersey corrections official says 
we know how to run prisons we dont know how to run oldage 
homes the last of a threepart series medicine behind bars 
looks at elderly care in prisons 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
augustus bass has had seven heart attacks 
and a stroke he has arthritis high blood pressure and recurring 
chest pains the 67yearold man is also locked up in prison 
serving 515 years for manslaughter 
this is a good place to bring you to let you die said bass 
his closecropped beard and thinning hair flecked with gray if 
you have a heart attack in prison youre up the creek without a 
paddle 
its pretty depressing to be old and in prison said bass 
who limps about with a cane every time you get a pain in your 
chest you dont know if its the last time i just dont want to 
die in here youd just be another number gone 
bass is 2 years into his sentence at kansas norton 
correctional facility where prison officials are building a 
geriatric unit to care for the special medical needs of elderly 
inmates 
nationwide the number of graying prisoners is growing due to a 
rising prison population and the introduction of nonparole and 
mandatory sentences in the mid1970s and they are beginning to 
pose costly health care problems 
as of last summer 18801 prisoners were older than 55 a 50 
percent increase in four years according to a tally by the 
american correctional association florida expects its elderly 
population to grow by 129 percent in 11 years 
these elderly inmates still a fraction of the 627402 total 
prisoners may have chronic heart liver lung and kidney 
conditions some suffer from cancer diabetes strokes alzheimers 
disease high blood pressure arthritis and the effects of years of 
alcohol and drug abuse 
they may need foods free of salt and sugar not the starchy fare 
served in mess halls now they require hearing aids eye glasses 
and dentures they may need ramps and elevators for their canes and 
wheelchairs or they may need an extra blanket in winter or a 
firmer mattress for their frail backs 
prisons were not designed for older people said julia hall 
a social psychologist at drexel university specializing in aging 
and criminals nobody is brutalizing them or purposely neglecting 
them but nobody is prepared to care for them and it is costly 
kansas where the elderly prison population doubled in six 
years has 153 inmates over 55 including 31 who are past 65 
a geriatric unit is being built at a former state tuberculosis 
hospital and mental unit surrounded by farm fields four miles 
outside this prairie town of 3400 residents 
the unit will be more like a college dorm than a prison 
cellblock outer doors including one leading to the chapel have 
wheelchair ramps 
cells are converted hospital rooms and close with wooden doors 
rather than steel bars inmates all medium or minimumsecurity 
prisoners will have keys to their rooms 
prison staff will be specially trained to be more sensitive to 
older inmates needs a gym and basketball court would presumably 
get little use so the recreation room will have board games each 
cell has a cable tv hookup to accommodate inmates too infirm to 
work 
its been a neglected population older people have more 
medical problems said louis bruce director of the norton 
prison when you get older you dont see as well you dont hear 
as well and you just cant get around as well 
corrections officials also want to separate them from young 
bullying inmates who might harm them 
they cant fend for themselves they just become easy prey 
theyre pretty fair game said jay shelton assistant prison 
director 
richard baker 66 came to the norton prison to serve his 
1to5year sentence for driving without a license after a drunken 
driving conviction he has emphysema arthritis and a heart 
condition and he was given a cane after twice falling down steps 
at the prison reception center in topeka 
i dont have any trouble getting down steps getting up them 
is a different story the whitehaired baker dressed in prison 
denim said with a laugh 
but he promptly stopped his joking i dont think the public 
or the institution sympathizes with us the attitude is let him 
die if you did the crime do the time he said i stay to 
myself i stay in my room and play solitary i dont mix with 
crowds i stay away from excitement 
ernest smith 57 serving 4 to 20 years for possession of 
marijuana said prison is a place called hell for the elderly 
its even worse everything hurts more in prison every emotion is 
intensified 
the indignities are manifold elderly inmates who need 
painkillers medications and sleeping pills must queue up two or 
three times a day for single doses individual prescriptions in 
bottles might encourage black market trade 
canes are given to lame or unsteady inmates only under special 
conditions for fear they could become weapons or vehicles for 
smuggling contraband even wheelchairs are searched 
we know how to run prisons we dont know how to run oldage 
homes said bud walsh an executive assistant in the new jersey 
department of corrections 
his state where the elderly inmate count is expected to 
increase fivefold in 11 years is considering adding a geriatric 
unit one study projects that 9 of 10 prisoners now in their 30s 
will be older than 50 before they get their first chance at parole 
or release 
the biggest complaint from elderly inmates is their medical 
problems arent being addressed fast enough walsh said we 
really dont do preventive medicine we dont have the staff and 
the facilities the regular prison unit is not equipped to handle 
the kinds of problems geriatric inmates present and the medical 
costs may be astronomical 
the average cost putting someone behind bars for a year is 
23000 but the tab for an elderly inmate triples mainly because 
of health needs according to larry fultz of the maryland parole 
commission 
money goes for such expensive operations as heart bypass 
surgery procedures like kidney dialysis or longterm medications 
for high blood pressure and enphysema 
at the eastern state correctional facility near philadelphia 
inmates formed the concerned seniors group they meet thursday 
evenings to discuss health care and other issues of concern 
its a sad way to end a life said drexels hall who helped 
organize the group they have such a sense of despair and 
depression they feel their lives have been totally wasted

in 1984 thousands of ethiopian jews unable to 
practice their religion as they chose in their own country were 
secretly airlifted to israel to begin a new life this is a report 
on how these people of dark skin and different ways are faring 
today among israelis 
</TEXT>

five years have passed since ayano mamo 
abandoned his farm and began a monthslong odyssey from the forests 
of ethiopia to the holy land where all would be bright and 
wonderful 
now mamo like many of israels 16500 ethiopian jewish 
immigrants feels disillusioned and alienated in a country where 
quiet traditional africans dont quite fit in 
their primitive farming methods are not needed their lack of 
sophistication is a cause for condescension and their skin color 
is sometimes a target of discrimination 
even their jewish faith has been questioned 
the ethiopians disappointment is all the greater because of 
their harsh struggle to emigrate and their dramatic arrival from 
sudan in the secret operation moses airlift for which the 
united states provided planes and pilots the operation was 
overseen by george bush then ronald reagans vice president 
mamos road to israel was harder than most 
after leaving his village in 1984 he was detained by 
antigovernment ethiopian rebels for one month they beat his wife 
and stole his money 
let go the family joined 150 other emigrants in walking to 
sudan it took a month and without adequate food and water their 
2yearold daughter died one of 10 who perished en route 
in sudan 25 more of the group died because of malnutrition and 
disease including mamos aunt uncle and three nephews 
we had faith in the holy one blessed be he that despite the 
suffering he was with us mamo said through an interpreter in 
his native amharic at his apartment in the southern coastal city of 
ashkelon 
as he walked through the desert mamo said he thought about 
the israel of my dreams all would be bright and wonderful even at 
night there would be sunshine after we gathered in from the 
exile 
five years since the exodus almost 30 percent of ethiopians 
still live in dormitorystyle government housing centers the 
national council for ethiopian jews says unemployment among the 
ethiopian immigrants above age 35 is about 45 percent 
mamo 54 lives in a small governmentsupplied apartment with 
his wife and four of his chidren he has no job partly because he 
acquired a blood disease from drinking polluted water on the trek 
to sudan and cannot do heavy work 
the apartment complex where he lives is filled with almost 2000 
ethiopian immigrants and is disparagingly called the ethiopian 
ghetto by unsympathetic neighbors 
israel officials say they are making progress in settling the 
new immigrants the children have proven able to quickly adapt to 
the new culture with more than 400 ethiopians enrolled in israeli 
universities and many others serving in elite army units 
but officials concede the newest immigrants had more 
difficulties than any of the jewish communities that came from 
europe the middle east and north africa as part of the 
ingathering that began after the creation of israel as a nation in 
1948 
most new immigrants spoke french or english and they had some 
skills said uri gordon director of immigration and absorption 
in the jewish agency with the ethiopians we had to start anew 
he said ethiopian immigrants are given intensive hebrew classes 
and provided social workers to help them acclimate 
the threemonth operation moses airlift in 1984 brought more 
than 8000 ethiopian jews to israel joining others who managed to 
flee earlier 
the new ethiopian immigrants many villagers who spoke only 
amharic found themselves shunted aside in a society known for its 
chutzpah a hebrew word meaning audacious to the point of 
rudeness 
we left our culture and came here where they dont speak our 
language or follow our customs and now we find ourselves in poor 
jobs and gaining little respect said mesfin ambau director of 
the jerusalembased organization of ethiopian immigrants there 
is a lot of pain inside 
the ethiopians first confrontation in israel was with the 
nations powerful rabbinate which ruled that the community after 
2000 years of isolation from world jewry had deviated in its 
religious practice and needed to undergo symbolic conversions 
nothing hurt us more than that said ziv sahelev 20 an 
ethiopian immigrant who lives in a government absorption center 
the ethiopians refused any type of conversions and the 
rabbinate was forced to seek a compromise that quieted the dispute 
like more than a third of the ethiopian community sahalev left 
behind close relatives in his case his father and three sisters 
on the expectation that he would return and bring them to the 
promised land 
but ethiopias marxist government which has no diplomatic 
relations with israel and close relations with radical arab states 
halted the airlift shortly after it was disclosed and 15000 jews 
remain stranded in ethiopia 
rahamim elazar director of the national council for ethiopian 
jews said ethiopian youngsters many separated from their parents 
have a suicide rate five times higher than other israeli teenagers 
there are so many who were left behind and the children feel 
terribly guilty he said 
sahalev said that since he came to israel he has given up hope 
of returning to ethiopia to bring the rest of his family 
i write to them every week and after a month or two i get an 
answer he said 
another problem for the ethiopians is that they are virtually 
the only blacks in israel 
sometimes people joke with me and point at me and start 
saying look hes black sahalev said it makes me feel very 
uncomfortable 
in kiryat chaim a residential area of small cottages near haifa 
in northern israel neighbors rose up in protest when the jewish 
agency moved four large ethiopian families into the areas only 
apartment complex in january 
its a quiet area and people came to me and complained that 
the ethiopian children made noise at night they didnt throw their 
garbage away said giora fischer district head of kiryat chaim 
in informal ways they also made it clear to me that they felt 
their property values were declining

editors note some 35 million americans lack health insurance 
and according to some estimates as many as 250000 patients are 
batted from hospital to hospital each year because they cant pay 
the bills here is the story of the first doctor prosecuted under 
the nations patient dumping law and the circumstances surrounding 
his decision to transfer a woman about to give birth 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was dr michael burditts day off when 
rosa rivera showed up at detar hospital late on a friday afternoon 
poor uninsured and about to give birth to her sixth baby 
her blood pressure also was high so high that the obstetrician 
asked the nurse who called him to repeat the figures 
i didnt think id heard what i heard burditt recalls 
there was no mistake rosa riveras blood pressure was 210 over 
130 higher than any burditt had seen in 12 years of delivering 
babies in this south texas city 
in one respect rosa rivera was not unusual at all poor 
pregnant women frequently come to detar to give birth without 
having seen a doctor before 
she sounds like more than i can handle said burditt chief 
of the private hospitals obstetrical department he asked nurse 
tammy kotsur to arrange for an ambulance to transport the woman to 
john sealy hospital in galveston 160 miles away 
kotsur put him on hold turned to her supervisor donna kiening 
and said he wants to transfer her what should i tell him 
tell him youve got to check on a few things said kiening 
a bytherulebook nurse who had recently become the supervisor of 
the obgyn department 
so began a case that eventually would land a doctor in trouble 
with washington and force a new look at an old question when 
should the government secondguess a doctors judgment in treating 
patients 
the nurses were uneasy because of a new federal antipatient 
dumping law that was part of something called cobra the 
consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 
hospitals cannot turn away patients needing emergency care or in 
active labor 
a case could be made that rosa rivera qualified on both counts 
about 2 hours after arriving at detar and after some heated 
words between burditt and the nurses rosa rivera left the hospital 
in an ambulance she had her baby a halfhour later in the 
ambulance by the side of the road 
mrs rivera and her son survived the dec 5 1986 ordeal 
but detar hospital nearly lost its eligibility for medicare 
funding and michael burditt became the first doctor prosecuted 
under the patient dumping law 
detar paid a 5000 fine but burditt refused to pay the 25000 
he was assessed the texas and american medical associations took 
his side and he is now awaiting the verdict of a health and human 
services administrative law judge expected in july 
some 35 million americans lack health insurance according to 
some estimates as many as 250000 patients are batted from 
hospital to hospital each year because they cant pay the bills 
the following account is drawn from interviews with burditt 
mrs rivera and others as well as the 961page transcript of the 
fourday hearing held in late january in the case of the inspector 
general vs michael l burditt 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rosa rivera two days shy of 32 had misgivings about going to 
detar then part of the hospital corporation of america the 
countrys largest forprofit hospital chain 
i had heard that it was a real expensive hospital that people 
had to take money with them mrs rivera said 
but she felt she had no choice citizens memorial the county 
hospital had shut its obstetrical unit a few months earlier 
it had not been an easy year for the riveras rent money was 
always a problem and they had moved at least twice after losing a 
300aweek janitors job her husband adolph rivera could only 
find parttime work 
still mrs rivera knew she should see a doctor early in her 
pregnancy a doctor at citizens had warned her in 1982 after her 
fifth child was born that she had chronic hypertension 
at the county clinic they told her to apply for medicaid she 
was turned down and her family made too much to qualify for a 
texas medically needy program with an income cutoff of 468 a month 
dr pattie dodson head of the victoria county health 
department said that if mrs rivera had been more persistent a 
clinic nurse would have examined her 
but mrs rivera gave up looking for free care 
i called several doctors and they all wanted 900 they all 
told me they needed a lot of money down 400 600 different 
prices we just didnt have it she said 
in october 1986 she called the clinic to ask about a midwife 
she says a clerk told her dont worry about it when its time 
for you to have your baby just go to detar and they have to see 
you

burditt came to victoria in 1974 after training in obstetrics at 
john sealy hospital in galveston 
as a statefunded teaching hospital sealy routinely accepts 
seriously ill transfer patients from hospitals across east texas 
its nursery and neonatologists are capable of caring for preemies 
and other babies clinging to life by the thinnest of strands 
burditt was brought to victoria by two obstetricians who later 
formed the victoria womens clinic after an acrimonious split in 
1982 burditt felt he couldnt call on a womens clinic doctor for 
help even in an emergency 
burditt a broadshouldered man who favors stetsons and boots 
and relishes the hours he spends outdoors on his cattle ranch la 
matrice the womb chose to practice by himself 
for two years burditt was on call around the clock 365 days a 
year 
he also was a single parent kimberly then 13 eldest of three 
girls chose to live with her father after her parents split in 
1983 as best i could i tried to ensure my presence in her 
life burditt said 
so burditt eliminated some of the uncertainties of an 
obstetrical practice 
the sign inside his office door reads we do not accept 
medicare or medicaid 
he screens the patients he does accept providing a lowcost 
ultrasound at 18 weeks that allows him to rule out half the major 
fetal abnormalities and to get a better fix on the mothers due 
date 
burditt who charges the highest price in town refers women 
with highrisk pregnancies to another doctor in town or to 
specialists in houston or galveston

burditt induces labor in most of 12 to 15 women whose babies he 
delivers each month allowing the newborn to enter the world at a 
more convenient time for mother and doctor alike he takes fridays 
and weekends off 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
burditt also was on an emergency rotation list in the hospital 
to handle unaligned patients like rivera who come in without a 
doctor 
in practice unaligned usually also means poor and uninsured 
in an era of soaring malpractice insurance premiums such 
patients pose a special worry for the physicians 
they can be very frightening said dr terry whitehouse a 
womens clinic obstetrician you dont know them youve got no 
rapport whatsoever with them theyve got the same access to the 
lawyers with the 1800 numbers that everybody else has got theyve 
got the best legal care available postevent but theyve got no 
prenatal care before the event 
but attending such patients is part of the price physicians pay 
for the privilege of practicing at detar 
that friday doye bridges was next on the rotation he was out 
of town so the call went to burditt who was covering for him

mrs rivera her water broken was wheeled into the hospital at 
4 pm 
burditt who insists he would never transfer a patient sight 
unseen said he shifted course to the hospital as soon as the nurse 
called him about the rivera case 
you picture this lady and shes a time bomb to blow her head 
off have a heart attack amniotic fluid embolism he said she 
probably has a baby that could be severely growth retardedyou 
dont have any idea where you are or what youre going to be 
dealing with 
kotsur had told him not only riveras blood pressure but other 
essential facts her previous labors lasted 24 hours her largest 
baby was 8 to 9 pounds and breech her cervix was 3 centimeters 
dilated and 70 percent effaced the babys head was not yet in 
position to come through the birth canal 
her contractions were coming every three to five minutes and 
lasting 60 seconds 
in the labor room mrs rivera said i felt safe i thought 
that it would just be a little bit more and the baby would be 
born 
when burditt called back he asked for kotsur but i was 
immediately directed to kiening which i considered very unusual 
kiening told him that the nurses believed the transfer would be 
unsafe because of mrs riveras blood pressure she also told him 
that she had talked to jean herman the associate director of 
nursing and charles sexton the hospital administrator 
here all of a sudden ive got this severely ill patientand 
this incompetent nurse is telling me i cant transfer her thats 
bull burditt said later 
kiening told him hed have to come in to evaluate the patient 
and make arrangements 
he said he was on his way 
kiening then asked if i could have some orders to start an iv 
or if he wanted me to do anything else 
burditts response was so unusual the nurse didnt write it in 
the medical record because she felt that would be damaging to dr 
burditt 
burditt said she could start an iv on rivera but only if the 
woman could be transported by ambulance to galveston 
if she couldnt be transported by ambulance i was not to 
start an iv because she would need to be transported by private 
vehicle the nurse said 
burditt said later his instructions about the iv were meant just 
to aggravate donna 
kiening started the iv without waiting to check on the 
ambulance by the time she returned to the nurses station burditt 
had arrived 
as he heade off to examine mrs rivera another labor and 
delivery nurse dawn burns called out to him 
i have another unaligned patient here shes bleeding 
heavily she said 
burditt next in the alphabetical rotation for unaligned 
patients replied that he would see the new woman sylvia ramirez 
after checking mrs rivera 
for burditt one look at mrs rivera was reassuring 
she didnt look like somebody who had acute hypertension or 
preeclampsia he said she looked like a typical multiparous 
latinamerican female 
burditt estimated that rivera was carrying a 6pound baby 
smaller than any shed had before i felt like we had a 
growthretarded child this confirmed burditts first inclination 
this lady was indeed more than i felt like i could handle 
he recalled 
it was shortly before 5 pm burditt went to the doctors lounge 
to call john sealy hospital 
burditt said he knew hed get nothing but a big runaround if 
he called one of the big hospitals in houston 122 miles away 
but i knew that i could call john sealy labor and delivery and 
i would talk to somebody he said 
that somebody turned out to be dr peggy downing 
burditt told her the ambulance had been called and asked for 
instructions downing now practicing in palmer alaska told him 
to start rivera on magnesium sulfate an anticonvulsant drug 
burditt passed the order on to kiening 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jean herman meanwhile informed burditt it was against the law 
to transfer a woman in labor 
against the law what are you talking about im a doctor through 
the years word got out that money was to be made 
recycling brass shell casings ejected by aircraft on strafing runs 
that led to a may 1974 incident in which five young men hired to 
collect the casings died after being abandoned on the range 
without provisions 
theres little likelihood of a repeat tragedy most of the 
100roundspersecond cannons aboard the f15 f16 and a10 
aircraft used today spit the valuable casings into containers and 
bring them back 
the lead sells for about 25 cents a pound by the time you 
hauled it out it wouldnt be worth it says ray murphy a 
civilian spotter on a gunnery monitoring tower 
more recently a marine helicopter found 22 illegal aliens who 
survived an attempt to march north over the range to reach 
interstate 8 three others died in the ordeal 
roberts said history ought to warn visitors to enter the desert 
prepared carrying food maps and water 
luke home of the 832nd air division is a tactical air command 
base and has no heavy bombers but its fighter pilots must be able 
to hit ground targets with cannon fire bombs or rockets and must 
be able to fight enemy aircraft 
st johns men use an onbase junkyard to fabricate targets 
metal drums laid endtoend and decorated with fins off old aerial 
targets emerge as aircraft on a runway old road machinery turns 
into a train parked on a siding 
pilots are given simulations of every possible target including 
missile emplacements and are trained on both flat and uneven 
terrain 
he said beginners in aircraft rigged to carry bombs drop a 
small tubeshaped object which contains a smoke charge visible for 
miles but before graduation from tactical training each pilot 
also has to drop a live bomb 
theres nothing like the experience says roberts a decorated 
officer who flew 170 combat hours in southeast asia in the 1970s 
it feels different when you drop a 500pound bomb he says 
they need to feel it drop off the plane and also its the 
training involved in telling somebody this is a live weapon 
preflight it and make sure it has no defects

editors note not much has changed on the island of sark in 
the past several centuries except for the nazi occupation during 
world war ii and that suits the islanders just fine they dont 
turn tourists away but they dont court them either and the 
islands leaders pride themselves more on what they dont do rather 
than what they do

trapped in a time warp between 
england and france the tiny island of sark clings to its feudal 
ways resolutely shunning such 20thcentury delights as cars 
planes and income tax 
with high cliffs set in a fickle sea and a perplexing 
constitutional setup to keep the foreigners guessing sark remains 
what the victorian poet algernon charles swinburne called a 
small sweet world of waveencompassed wonder 
its 560 people are ruled by a seigneur whose privileges 
include the sole right to keep pigeons and female dogs and a 
parliament with 40 hereditary members and 12 elected deputies 
land on the 4squaremile island cannot be sold without the 
seigneurs permission and every real estate deal nets him a 75 
percent commission and if he wished he could sell the whole 
island to a new seigneur subject to royal permission 
sark is part of the channel island archipelago in the english 
channel which makes it british but not part of the united kingdom 
so while london takes care of such trivia as defense and foreign 
affairs sarks parliament wrestles with the major issues like 
whether to reroute horseandcarriage traffic to keep horse 
droppings off the main street 
there are no paved roads drugs sex crimes or pollution 
sarks sovereign is queen elizabeth ii but in her capacity as 
duke not duchess of normandy its an anachronism which like 
sarks french place names attests to the ebb and flow of french 
and english conquest over the centuries 
spring sunshine is already brightening the cliffs of sark as the 
morning boat from guernsey finishes its bumpy 7mile voyage and 
jostles gently into place against the limpetencrusted jetty 
islanders and earlyseason tourists disembark and wobble up the 
stone stairs some clamber aboard a tractortowed wagon for a 
oneminute journey into town a lady carrying a potted plant is 
carried grandly away in a horsedrawn carriage a few brave souls 
prefer the footpath up the savagely steep hill walking through 
carpets of blue wildflowers 
a short ride by rented bicycle down the avenue sarks main 
street leads past the islands one pay phone and mailbox to the 
seigneurie the gardened mansion where 61yearold michael beaumont 
exerts benign lordship over sark 
beaumont inherited the title from his grandmother the 
redoubtable dame sybil hathaway who ruled sark for 47 years and 
became worldrenowned as the woman who kept the 20th century at bay 
she it was who fended off every bureaucrat mainland or local 
who tried to tamper with sarks ways it was she wrote a battle 
for existence against men who can take off for the moon but 
cannot be reasonable and leave people in peace in this world 
she refused to flee when the wehrmacht overran sark and when 
world war ii was over the captured german occupiers were made to 
fix the roads their tanks and trucks had damaged 
in 1969 she threatened to abdicate rather than let chief pleas 
the island parliament change the law banning cars 
when she died in 1974 at age 90 many wondered whether sark 
would finally emerge from its time capsule but beaumont has 
faithfully guarded his grandmothers legacy 
the seigneurship was quite a career change he was an engineer 
working on guided missiles in bristol when as eldest son of the 
dames eldest son he inherited sark 
hes an affable softspoken man of 61 who prefers opennecked 
shirts and believes in handsoff government a lot of the power 
of the seigneur he says is in his ability not to do things 
rather than to do things 
does sark have any problems he cant think of any serious ones

does the island want more tourists well we dont want to go 
downmarket just to attract people great leisure camps or 
disneylands anything of that sort 
a marina he looks horrified oh no no no nothing like 
that 
nor will there be an airport concordes occasional sonic booms 
are bad enough the ban on cars holds firm and the only motorized 
vehicle permitted is the tractor there are 61 on the island plus 
73 horses and 1102 bicycles the dame got about in an electric 
wheelchair when arthritis afflicted her but it took special 
legislation in chief pleas to make that possible 
sark was a wild pirateinfested place until 1565 when a 
jerseyman named helier de carteret set out to clean it up he 
parceled out the land to 40 farmers giving each a piece of cliff 
to guard 
sark passed down by sale or inheritance until a 19thcentury 
seigneur mortgaged it to dame sybils greatgrandmother marie 
collings to finance a silvermining venture on the island he went 
broke mrs collings foreclosed and the present seigneurial 
dynasty began 
many of the seigneurial rights have since fallen away the 
seigneurs veto over legislation once absolute is now limited to 
21 days he still gets his cut or treizieme on land sales but 
has had to make ends meet by converting part of the seigneurie into 
vacation cottages for rent 
no longer does each farmer have to render a chicken a year to 
the seigneur hell settle for 85 cents instead 
the seigneur is still entitled to all flotsam and jetsam on 
sarks coast but nothing of value ever turns up a few years 
back an awful lot of wood arrived on the island beaumont 
recalls and they did phone me up and ask me if i wanted it he 
didnt 
queen elizabeth is charter required the seigneur to pay her an 
annual rent totaling onetwentieth part of a knights fee it 
didnt however foresee inflation so the check beaumont mails to 
buckingham palace every michaelmas day is for just 304 
sark has never had income tax welfare schooling and basic 
utilities are financed by the dames charities a 1 landing toll 
on each of its annual 80000 visitors and an annual capital tax 
its collection is thoroughly informal each householder declares 
his wealth to the douzaine or 12member finance committee of chief 
pleas which takes up to 10 percent no audits are needed the 
sarkees say because everyone knows everyone elses worth 
with excise duties nonexistent cigarettes and liquor cost half 
the mainland price 
the channel islands have become prosperous tax havens but sark 
accessible only by small boat is unattractive to tax exiles and 
anyway says beaumont i dont think sark needs any more people 
and were not looking for investment 
things are quiet on sark these days the last serious crime was 
in 1987 when a tireslashing war broke out between two rival 
bikerental firms 
so with the court idle and chief pleas in recess the greffier 
or town clerk is spending his days transcribing the minutes of 
chief pleas from centuries past 
he copies the handsome flowery handwriting onto the backs of 
old calendars and it will then be typed into a computer by his son 
trevor for posterity he started at 1675 and four years later he is 
up to 1928 
the greffier john hamon doubles as sarks blacksmith hes 64 
speaks gallictinged english and can converse in the islands dying 
normanfrench patois and what does he learn from the minutes of 
chief pleas past 
that as things change you adapt he says you only have 
to look back a few hundred years at the minutes of chief pleas to 
see that everything that happens today has happened before so we 
manage very well indeed and long may it stay that way

sark channel islands ap sark is a law unto itself english 
courts have no jurisdiction here so rulings by the seneschal or 
chief magistrate can only be appealed directly to the queen 
a prevot sheriff connetable constable and vingtenier 
deputy keep the peace and lock offenders in a windowless twocell 
jail but only for two days bigger crimes such as a tireslashing 
war between rival bikerental firms are dealt with in guernsey 
the island 7 miles away 
in the 15th century it took a papal threat of eternal damnation 
to deter the french english scots and danes from periodically 
pillaging the channel islands 
today sarks main aggravation is pub rowdiness attributable in 
part to taxfree liquor at half the mainland price one summer 
things were so bad that police had to be called in guernsey 
bits of norman law survive such as the clameur de haro 
whereby a wronged person declares in front of the offender and a 
witness haro haro haro a laide mon prince on me fait tort 
help me my prince i am being wronged followed by the lords 
prayer 
the offender must immediately desist and wait for the court to 
rule it works well in settling trespass cases which are common on 
a tiny island with farmland in short supply 
sybil hathaway for 47 years the dame of sark was sometimes 
accused of being a dictator she showed her mettle in 1969 when she 
threatened to abdicate unless chief pleas the island parliament 
behaved itself 
i feel that it becomes unbearable when the very laws that are 
made by chief pleas are broken by the members themselves she 
declared then i can no longer publicize the island as a haven of 
rest when there are 42 tractors few of which obey the traffic 
lawsi am tired ofthe utter disregard for the pub licensing 
laws 
but she also was fed up with fielding everybodys complaints 
as if i were personally to blame for everything that other people 
dislikeafter all i have only one vote in chief pleas like 
everyone else and contrary to what many imagine i have no power 
to impose any views of my own 
the abdication threat worked the laws were tightened and the 
dame ruled on until her death five years later at age 90

editors note do people love their pets enough to pay for 
their braces a few root canals and crowns or even just some 
dental checkups a growing number of veterinarians are deciding 
that the answer is yes pet dentistry though still in its infancy 
has become a hot topic in the field of animal health care 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
a woman came into dr john saidlas offices 
several years ago and said she just couldnt bear another look at 
her toothless schnauzers gummy grin 
was there anything the veterinarian could do 
most animal doctors would have said no but not saidla a 
pioneer in dental care for pets 
we put in a bridge and it stayed in there for 2 years until 
he died says saidla who has been poking around in animal mouths 
for decades we never had any trouble she used to use a water 
pick to clean it 
dentistry has become a hot topic in the field of pet health 
care a 5 billionayear industry 
and that begs a question for the 90s do people love their pets 
enough to pay for their braces a few root canals and crowns or 
even just some dental checkups 
saidla and a growing group of veterinarians at the top of the charts 
rock has undergone a lot of 
changes since then and dion dimucci who was recently inducted into 
the rock n roll hall of fame became a solo singer years ago 
today he thumbs his nose at those who scoff at geriatric 
rockers and keeps on playing his music his way 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
dion is turning 50 but hes ready to rock n 
roll till hes in a rocking chair 
as a teenager in the bronx dion dimucci put together a group 
of singers and named it for the neighborhoods belmont avenue dion 
and the belmonts became the most popular vocal group of rock n 
rolls doowop era 
at 15 he made his first professional appearance on a paul 
whiteman show and he first saw walking down the street the 
redhead whos still his wife and the mother of his three daughters 
five years later dion and the belmonts had their first top 10 
record a teenager in love 
this year dion who wears a jaunty bronx taxi drivers cap even 
at home in boca raton fla has a new rock n roll album yo 
frankie which is getting good reviews he wrote most of the 
songs 
dion who turns 50 on july 18 was inducted into the rock n 
roll hall of fame in january 
some of his generation became tuxedoed nightclub singers 
im a diehard dion says ive always been a rock n 
roll enthusiast in case i lose my job as a rock n roll singer 
ill drive a cab ive got my cabbie cap but ive been fortunate 
i always paid the rent ive never done another job never 
dion isnt buying any dont trust anybody over 30 stuff or 
pronouncements by mick jagger and peter townshend of the who about 
not wanting to be geriatric rockers 
when i started there was no rock n roll no expectations no 
rules dion says some people got the idea that rock n roll 
was just for the young today we know thats not so you could be 
an old fogey at 19 you can be kicking up your heels at 63 its an 
attitude 
rock at its best lifts your spirit keeps you aware makes you 
feel and think keeps you young 
if you start with the anger and a sound to get the girls and 
keep on you find out its really an artistic expression you can 
share your thoughts this is powerful 
rock n roll may have moved through doowop british invasions 
and disco to postpunk but for dion it hasnt changed much 
the only thing that has changed is the equipment he says 
basically youve got a backbeat electric guitars and its dance 
music 
this new album is an 80s album but it has elements of my 
music its black music filtered through an italian neighborhood 
you come out with an attitude 
i always used a bunch of guys to imitate a horn section 
because i couldnt afford a horn section i became kind of 
identified with that sound ruby baby runaround sue i use it 
all through this album 
when i was growing up we used to bang on cardboard boxes and i 
had a guitar and a bunch of guys would sing you put a drum to that 
and you go with all the technology today it comes out with more 
power and clarity 
after doowop faded and dion conquered a drug problem he became 
a folk singer he had a hit with abraham martin and john 
i wasnt striking lightning in the sky he says that song 
gave me a chance to sit in coffeehouses which were flourishing 
around the country and play acoustic guitar and express myself 
those times were wonderful for me for the first time it 
became a twoway street the audience and me when i started out 
we used to run out at the brooklyn fox and do two songs then fats 
domino would do two songs jerry lee lewis would do two 
in 1980 i got into gospel music it was a way to express what 
was inside me i made five gospel albums i dont call it religious 
music i dont look at myself as religious 
dion a solo singer since 1960 had a reunion concert with the 
belmonts in 1972 but has stayed off rock revival tours i feel 
like i would dry up if i did that 
but i love doing the old songs those songs become more 
valuable to me every year i love to see the joy the wanderer and 
runaround sue bring to people when arista records wanted me to 
do an album i said id do it if i can do a rock n roll album in 
the tradition of those two songs meaning get into some strong 
characters 
dion says he got a lot of help on his new album paul simon 
sings on written on the subway wall and hes in the video we 
did it on a subway platform in the middle of the night dion 
says we had about 15 cops 20 guardian angels it was great we 
had dinner served down there 
i had paul sing one of my favorite doowop songs little 
star done by the elegants in the middle of subway wall 
one of my friends had a bunch of 8mm film of us from the old 
days its woven through the whole video the end shows me in my 
first car which i bought for 75 
personally dion says im kind of an oddball ive got the 
same wife i started off with we grew up together we love each 
other the real thing that kept us going is that we accepted each 
other at our worst we walked through the valley i was with her at 
her lowest and she was with me at my lowest 
weve got three great daughters theyre a joy im blessed 
dion is looking forward to his 50th birthday party 
its going to be a bash he says therell be a lot of 
friends with instruments i probably will get into the mood to 
play

scott bakula in his role as 
timetraveling sam beckett in nbcs quantum leap never knows 
who he will be from week to week 
beckett in fact seldom knows who he is or what he looks like 
until he catches sight of himself in a mirror beckett you see is 
a scientist tapdancing his way through time as the result of a 
timetravel experiment that went haywire 
whenever he leaps in time he becomes a different person the 
audience sees him as beckett but to people in the story he appears 
as the other person he must stay there as that person until he 
solves a problem and leaps again in time 
he has been a teenage hot rodder a black man a professor a 
test pilot and assorted other identities next season hes a woman 
and a ghostbusting parapsychologist 
hes occasionally joined by his mentor albert played by dean 
stockwell albert however appears as a holographic projection 
visible only to beckett and to the audience 
in one show i was a gangster hit man he says i popped in 
with my pants around my ankles and a woman saying frankie you 
were terrific dean popped up a minute later 
its great for me as an actor every show is so totally 
different although we only travel within the lifetime of my 
character which is from 1953 to the present we can do some period 
stories with old cars and props the hairdressers a couple of weeks 
ago had to do 50 beehive hairdos every day 
its a fun show to do it has elements of peggy sue got 
married and back to the future the twist is i get to be in 
somebody elses shoes 
bakula which rhymes with dracula is in pasadena for an episode 
set in a haunted mansion the huge stone house lined inside with 
marble and filled with statuary sits atop a hill across the arroyo 
seco from downtown pasadena 
donald bellisario executive producer and creator of quantum 
leap and his wife deborah pratt the producer are among those 
in the show bellisario is his mirror image and pratt is a woman 
who hires the parapsychologist because she believes her late 
husbands spirit is in the house 
ideally my own character of sam beckett shines through each 
new character every week says bakula don bellisario has 
written sam as a warm human being with a passion for his fellow 
man hopefully thatll come through so ill get involved with 
people 
i come into a situation i dont know whats going on then 
have to get acquainted and solve the problem its whimsical yet 
has an element of sadness sam is lost in time his life seems to 
be ended he lives his life as other people 
bakula says the offer to do the series came out of the blue 
hed just returned from new york where he had appeared in the 
musical romance romance 
i got the script on a wednesday and by friday we had a deal 
he says it was such a good script i didnt know don bellisario 
because somehow id totally missed magnum pi which was his 
show so it was a surprise to get a script that good 
quantum leap which nbc has renewed for next season is 
bakulas third tv series he smiles and says knock on wood the 
third times a charm its awfully nice to be picked up its 
disappointing when a show fails but both were great experiences 
for me 
his first was abcs gung ho in 198687 based on the hit 
movie about the cultural clash when a japanese car company opens a 
factory in pennsylvania he played the intermediary between the 
japanese bosses and the american workers 
next in 1988 was cbs eisenhower amp lutz a comedy created by 
alan burns cocreator with jim brooks of the mary tyler moore 
show he played buddy lutz a slightly shady lawyer who adds the 
name of eisenhower to his struggling oneman law office in an 
attempt to add some class 
his first television appearance in many years was in the pilot 
episode of cbs designing women as annie potts former husband 
i had been working in new york doing mostly theater work he 
says the last television id done was on our own in 1977 
dixie carter was in that and shes also in designing women i 
told her i only work in shows shes in 
after his move here in january 1986 bakula also worked on my 
sister sam and matlock and was in a television movie with 
john ritter he starred in a disney tv movie pilot called 
iman he played a man who breathed radiated gas and became 
indestructible 
i did a few soap opera things when i was in new york he 
says but mostly i worked in the theater 
bakula met his wife krista while on tour in connecticut they 
were both appearing in the bakers wife they now have a 
5yearold daughter and she has taken a leave of absence from 
acting

robert lupone uses his offandon employment in 
a chorus line to help finance his real dream a small theater 
troupe called the manhattan class company 
its my passion says lupone describing his nonprofit 
company which is located in a ramshackle building on 42nd streets 
theater row the whole thing was born out of volunteer labor and 
still is 
supporting this dream is why lupone returns periodically to a 
chorus line broadways longest running musical he was the 
original zach the enigmatic director in the show when it opened on 
broadway 14 years ago 
i dont even play a full week in a chorus line because half 
the time im doing something here he says referring to the 
manhattan class company but i evidently bring something of value 
to the show because they accept me on those terms 
lupone started manhattan class in 1983 with bernard telsey a 
onetime actor the company grew out of an acting class that 
lupone a veteran member of such groups as actors studio and circle 
repertory was teaching telsey who had been been a theater 
administration major was one of his students at new york 
university 
i never found the ensemble that i was looking for so i formed 
my own says the 42yearold lupone 
but i didnt want to form another acting company he 
recalls so bernie and i decided to develop new plays to sell to 
producers it would be a forprofit company and we would present 
staged readings of new american plays 
its guiding principle would be that playwrights would have the 
time here to develop an idea in workshop using professional actors 
and directors their first reading six years ago was optioned for 
broadway the next day 
we thought we were really hot stuff lupone recalls but 
we learned two and a half years later the play still wasnt 
produced 
that first season manhattan class did four readings each of 
three playsinprogress for wouldbe producers a process that 
continued until 1986 
the adventure of collaboration turns me on the director the 
actor and the playwright working together lupone says when 
you have a play thats already written half of the challenge is 
gone 
to survive manhattan class switched in 1986 to nonprofit 
status and became more of a mainstream theater when it began to 
give seasonal oneact productions at its tiny space on theater row 
the following year one of their oneact efforts beirut a 
futuristic aids play by alan bowne was done commercially 
offbroadway 
the reason that a year could pass between festivals is that we 
dont have the money or we are out working the actor says 
this is everybodys second job 
lupone big brother to broadway actress patti lupone has been 
in show business for nearly 30 years the long island native 
started as a dancer at 15 after graduating from juilliard he 
moved on to theater roles working in some broadway shows that were 
hits like jesus christ superstar and the magic show and 
others that never made it to new york like nefertiti 
but its a chorus line that has been lupones annuity over 
the years 
he was a dancer in director michael bennetts original workshop 
productions in 1975 and when the role of the director modeled 
after bennett himself was created lupone knew he could do it 
since then he has had almost a lovehate relationship with the 
part of zach 
its just a facility for the dancers to talk to says 
lupone explaining that the show is built around a series of 
auditions by dancers for a director who almost never is seen on 
stage 
plus i have diametrically opposed experiences in a chorus 
line he recalls i did it 14 years ago when there were yells 
and screams and standing ovations we were the darling of the town 
now you get japanese tourists who dont understand whats going on 
its not a full house and there are no yells 
if a job interests him or the money is good lupone will tear 
himself away from the manhattan class company in 1987 he starred 
on broadway in the infamous late nite comic a fourperformance 
musical flop last fall he traveled to the cleveland play house 
for a chance to appear in budd schulbergs stage adaptation of on 
the waterfront 
running a company has mellowed lupones own intense career 
desires that dominated his early acting days 
i was intense because i was so hungry he says when you 
have your own theater company my approval and acceptance doesnt 
come from acting anymore or whether people like me it comes from 
something of content hopefully thats the difference in me now 
vs me 10 years ago 
lupone and telsey are now planning the companys 198990 season 
if things go according to schedule and the duo can raise the funds 
they will do fulllength new american plays in the fall and spring 
with a oneact festival held in the winter their budget is an 
estimated 250000 most raised from corporate and foundation 
grants 
you start with the hope of what the theater can and should 
be lupone says thats why i get people to work here for 
little or no money thats what we sell not necessarily a superior 
product what we do sell is a community of committed artists

a steady erosion of apartheid 
laws allows people of different races to use the same public 
restrooms libraries and elevators stand in the same line at the 
post offices eat at the same restaurants dance and drink together 
south african whites and blacks also can sit next to each other 
at theaters picnic at the same parks and in some instances share 
trains buses and beaches they worship together at some churches 
compete together on some soccer teams and running clubs they can 
have an interracial love affair or marriage without fear of arrest 
but in many other ways they remain divided by ignorance and 
fear that has developed over decades of forced separation 
the average south african wouldnt know how to mix across 
different groups he wouldnt know what to say after he said 
hello said bernard chalmers a white management consultant who 
conducts crosscultural encounter groups for businesses schools 
and churches 
the phenomenon has been described as an invisible berlin wall 
that keeps blacks and whites from understanding and communicating 
with each other even though many of them now interact in ways that 
once were prohibited 
such encounters have become a fad as more people are working and 
living next to someone whose culture they dont understand 
blacks find out whites are not really as rich as they think 
and whites find out things like the black guy loves his children 
said chalmers its really at that level of finding the other 
human being is there 
the rev nico smith a white minister who was shunned by family 
and friends when he moved into the black township of mamelodi 
outside pretoria belongs to a nationwide religious organization 
that brings blacks and whites together for meals home visits and 
church services 
apartheid has been very successful smith said white 
people tell me we discovered black people are ordinary people 
like we are just that one expression is an indication of the 
total alienation that developed over the years 
the chasm is so wide that black professionals often say they 
feel insulted and patronized usually by wellmeaning white 
colleagues who think they are reaching across the cultural divide 
more dangerous than apartheid are the pseudoliberals who are 
really saying if you do things like me and come to be like me and 
take on my culture i will accept you said gabriel setiloane a 
black professor of religion at the mostly white university of cape 
town all my life i have been among these people who are 
insulting me every day because they can only accept me when i speak 
their language and do things they want to be done 
i tell them at the university how much of the african 
understanding of the being of life of values are coming into your 
curriculum your articles your relationships otherwise it means 
you have black students at the university that you are making 
white 
pearl ntuli a black marketing manager for a black magazine 
africa now said i do make friends with white people especially 
now that people are trying hard to reach out but some people end 
up being too patronizing we blacks are also very suspicious of 
them we think they they dont really mean it but eventually you 
learn to recognize the good people 
more businesses are recognizing they must rely on the growing 
black labor force to fill supervisory professional and technical 
positions and that the black majority population is their primary 
market 
daniel pholo the black manager of social programs for makro 
wholesale stores said his company has a program to promote black 
managers and a multiracial employee soccer team he instructs white 
supervisors about black employees different needs such as more 
time for lengthy mourning rituals after the death of a loved one 
but black and white makro employees seldom visit each other on 
weekends he said because few blacks have transport to white 
suburbs and whites are scared to go into black townships 
the government has moved from a policy of forcing apartheid on 
everyone to proposing the creation of integated residential areas 
for those who prefer them however it is committed to maintaining 
separate voter rolls and providing segregated neighborhoods public 
schools and hospitals for whites who want them 
apartheid laws still deny the black majority of 28 million the 
right to vote on national affairs assign them to underfunded 
schools with unqualified teachers and force most of them to live 
in impoverished rural homelands or underdeveloped overcrowded 
urban townships blacks are tried by white judges for breaking laws 
passed by white legislators all municipal governments have power 
to prohibit blacks from using any public facility 
blacks and whites get to know each other most easily as 
nextdoor neighbors said john kaneberman head of the independent 
south african institute of race relations he said an estimated 
100000 to 200000 black people live illegally in white 
neighborhoods engaged in grassroots civil disobedience on a mass 
scale 
the government seldom enforces the residential segregation law 
in most of the mixed areas kaneberman said whites are either 
apathetic or enthusiastic about their black indian or mixedrace 
neighbors 
there have been a couple of ugly incidents he added but 
because the opposition has in fact been pretty small the 
government has been able to turn a blind eye to it 
social contact across the color line is the rule now rather 
than the exception kaneberman said in the process of 
economic integration people are just discovering that when you 
actually meet people of another race they are not as terrible as 
you were brainwashed into believing

far fewer generations will see the worlds 
ancient monuments than have seen them already fewer still will see 
them if nations dont decide soon which to save and which to let 
die 
changing temperatures and humidities indoor and outdoor air 
pollution artificial light traffic bacteria and other ills are 
causing monuments and antiquities everywhere to fall apart 
the decisions are going to be difficult but if governments 
and officials dont act therell be very little left said luis 
monreal an international conservation specialist 
the next decade is crucial we have the technology wheres 
the courage 
what concerns monreal is a tendency of governments to ignore the 
warnings of archaeologists and conservationists who are spokesmen 
for the monuments and not for powerful political lobbies the 
problem becomes especially acute in countries rich in artifacts but 
poor in finances when antiquities officials try to take stands to 
save artifacts only to be overruled by politicians more interested 
in tourist dollars than in the monuments survival 
but we must decide which monuments can and should be saved 
monreal said whatever we do even if its the right thing man 
is going to lose 60 to 80 percent of his cultural heritage in the 
centuries ahead 
monreal heads the getty conservation institute of marina del 
rey calif the only private institution that researches ways to 
carry out cultural conservation and puts up the money to do it 
bits and pieces of the past from miniscule to gargantuan from 
the americas to china are specimens for gettys experts tombs 
mummies paintings adobe old photographs oriental lacquerware 
tapestries primitive rock drawings english silver 
how to save them 
getty money and expertise are cooperating with local officials 
in four major projects 
restoration and conservation of decaying wall paintings in the 
3500yearold tomb of queen nefertari favorite wife of pharaoh 
ramses ii across the nile river from luxor in southern egypt 
a pilot project to conserve romanera floor mosaics at paplos 
on cyprus in the mediterranean 
preservation of two major buddhist sites in china rock temples 
dating as early as ad 366 in the mogao grottoes at the edge of 
the gobi desert and the yungang grottoes 200 miles west of beijing 
a preservation showcase for organic materials including 27 
royal mummies in cairos egyptian museum and the dead sea scrolls 
in the israel museum in jerusalem 
monreal who recently was in cairo to discuss egypts crumbling 
past with officials said technology must be matched with specific 
needs 
its hard but officials are going to have to decide which 
monuments live and which die 
monreal cites two examples spains medieval castles and the 
4500yearold sphinx near cairo 
spain which is monreals home country wants to preserve its 
heritage but has so many troubled monuments it cant save them all 
there are 2000 medieval castles built during 700 years of 
warfare monreal said even if the entire spanish defense 
budget were turned over to save the castles it wouldnt be 
enough 
the problem is different with the sphinx a stone lion with a 
pharaohs face unique for its size monreal said theres no doubt 
it should be saved 
but the sphinx is terminal its dying what do you do for any 
terminal patient you put him in intensive care on a life support 
system 
he suggests covering the monument while scientists debate what 
to do but egyptian officials are uneasy about isolating one of the 
countrys top tourist attractions 
you can cover it and still allow people to see it as 
scientists decide whats the matter up to three years of study lie 
ahead but once they know officials will have to make a decision 
and that decision might not be popular 
monreal said getting the money for such work is the easiest 
part if its a good project saving the sphinx would be a gold mine 
for public relations companies would fall all over themselves to 
save the sphinx 
but too often he added wasting money a lot of money 
results from wrongheaded priorities 
some monuments will be saved that really dont matter and 
some that should be saved wont be he said what are you 
going to choose to save 30 percent of your monuments for 100 years 
or 10 percent for 1000 
its superficial to spread the batter too thin in some 
cases projects are taken on by corporations not because the relic 
is worthy of being saved but because its the pet of the chairman 
of the board 
we see this in italy and in the united states the situation 
is terrible 
on the other hand is mexico a country with many fragile 
monuments which monreal said is doing the best job of saving the 
artifacts that should be saved despite its economic problems 
years ago those who wanted to preserve the past were given the 
political power to make decisions he said today mexicos past 
is doing well 
monreal 46 has spent his adult life in museums seeking ways 
to preserve treasures coworkers call his life with monuments a 
passion and he admits its a utopian dream 
im perishable theyre perishable but im trying to keep 
whats standing standing he said 
even in 1000 years some monuments will be standing because 
they were so wellbuilt but when its finished its finished you 
cant change history but maybe you can prolong a monuments life

john keating is the kind of teacher of which every student 
dreamed but rarely encountered he tickles the ribs he fires the 
mind he preaches nonconformity he even instructs his pupils to 
rip out the innocuous introduction from a book of poetry 
obviously john keating isnt going to last at a rockribbed new 
england prep school in the 1960s 
robin williams portrays john keating in dead poets society 
with only a trace of adrian cronauer of good morning vietnam 
while trying to rouse his bored students he demonstrates how 
shakespeare could be done by marlon brando and john wayne 
otherwise he plays it straightarrow and he is wonderful 
dead poets society itself is wonderful like a cool oasis 
amid the arid summer of sequels it is that rare comedydrama that 
stimulates the mind as well as the emotions 
the title may be a turnoff for some folks but it shouldnt be 
when keating was a student at the school he and other freethinkers 
formed the society to read poetry and plot against the faculty 
unbeknownst to him his own students revive the custom in an 
obvious collision course with the authorities 
the film focuses more on the boys than on their teacher and 
they are portrayed with true insight the central figure is neil 
perry robert sean leonard who yearns to be an actor despite his 
fathers stern opposition neils roommate is todd anderson ethan 
hawke who is so withdrawn he cant speak up in class 
with their teachers inspiration neil decides to defy his 
father and todd comes out of his shell there is a terrific scene 
in which williams forces todd to recite a poem he had written the 
other boys in the cast are equally well drawn they talk and behave 
as you would expect rich boys of the period to 
australian peter weir who captured the american scene in 
witness does it again in dead poets society his direction 
of the young actors is brilliant and he keeps williams on a tight 
rein tom schulmans script is literate and clever veering to the 
ultimate tragedy the ending may jar some viewers unless they note 
the portents along the way 
robin williams should be applauded not only for his performance 
but for taking a role that is not a star turn in a film that may 
have to hunt for an audience a major factor in the film is john 
seales gorgeous photography of the new england scene actually 
delaware 
a touchstone picture produced by steven haft paul junger witt 
and tony thomas dead poets society is the biggest movie treat 
of the year so far rated pg for language and intensity running 
time 126 minutes

a cry in the dark warner home video vhsbeta 8995 
rated pg13 
 
another movie with meryl streep showing off a foreign accent 
that was the joke last fall when the prodigious actress starred in 
a cry in the dark as an australian mother wrongfully accused of 
murdering her infant daughter 
but this grim tale based on a true story is a lot more than a 
vehicle for streep to astonish with her facility for the cadences 
of an exotic dialect its a gripping account of how press police 
and prosecutors unwittingly conspired to send an innocent woman to 
jail for several years 
streep plays lindy chamberlain wife of a seventhday adventist 
minister and mother of three young children who goes on a camping 
trip with her family to mammoth ayers rock one night a dingo a 
wild dog of the outback steals into the tent where 9weekold 
azaria is sleeping kills the baby and runs off with her into the 
wilderness 
the film leaves no doubt this is what happened and at first 
witnesses police and the media seem sympathetic to the familys 
tragedy but as time goes by and no body is found only some 
bloodstained clothes gossip and speculation begin to arise in the 
tabloid press and on television talk shows that mrs chamberlain 
may have killed the child herself 
various forensic experts add credence to this theory from 
studying the blood and rips on the babys garments and soon mrs 
chamberlain is on trial for murder and her husband as an accessory 
both are convicted and she is sentenced to life imprisonment at 
hard labor while pregnant with her fourth child 
streeps performance is impressive especially her refusal to 
soften the mothers aloof at times hardbitten personality which 
prevents the jury from sympathizing with her sam neill does well 
in the lessinteresting role of her husband who suffers a crisis 
of faith and even turns on his wife when the pressure becomes too 
much for him 
director fred schepisi maintains a claustrophobic atmosphere 
that keeps our attention riveted on the seemingly unbelievable 
nightmare into which the chamberlains are dragged he and robert 
caswell adapted their screenplay from john brysons book evil 
angels 
the moviemakers timing was better than they could have 
anticipated last september just as the film was about to be 
released mrs chamberlain was formally cleared of all charges 
not a movie for a casual nights light entertainment but a 
strong provocative piece of work that documents with chilling 
realism one of the more amazing criminal justice stories of our 
time

midnight cop vidmark vhs 7995 rated r 
 
midnight cop is not a bad little mystery with its blend of 
blackmail murder and mayhem in the german underworld and to add a 
little spice a little pornography and incest are thrown in 
the movie clearly deserves its r rating with a good bit of 
nudity sexual situations and bloody violence but star morgan 
fairchild doesnt shed very much beyond her undies 
one could ask what shes doing in this movie which also stars 
michael york and frank stallone they just dont fit in with the 
teutonic tone of the flick and the movie is actually carried by 
german actor armin muellerstahl who plays a burnedout woman 
chasing hard drinking detective named alex conrad hes the type 
usually found in the lapd or nypd rather than with the stiff 
discipline styled prussian cops 
the movie also has a continuity problem with some characters 
speaking english while others speak german theres also a bit of 
dubbing these incongruities tend to throw off the pace of the 
story an exploration of the classic outlaw side of society 
while investigating the death of a young dancer alex hooks up 
with lisa fairchild and battles a vicious drug dealer 
stallone york plays a district attorney who is obviously not 
quite what he seems to be 
the video also has some truly comic moments mostly involving 
muellerstahl

rocket gibralter rcacolumbia home video vhsbeta 8998 
rated pg 
 
no one is more fun to watch than burt lancaster as an eccentric 
that gentle face is so forgiveable though his antics in rocket 
gibralter as in atlantic city and local hero can 
annoy those around him 
and lancaster does not disappoint as levi rockwell in daniel 
petries endearing tale of a man who knows he is soon to die 
rockwell is about to turn 77 and his four children and eight 
grandchildren have gathered to celebrate at his gracious spread on 
new yorks long island 
the family is close and caring although perhaps a little too 
pretty welloff and hip to engender complete sympathy their 
problems are sometimes hard to relate to such as a soninlaw who 
is a professional pitcher having trouble with his curve ball 
rockwell a widower who says he has come to live 90 percent in 
the past seems to communicate best with his young grandchildren 
who accept his ideas about the proper way to die without the 
emotional turmoil the adults display and it is the grandchildrens 
acceptance of rockwells wish for a viking funeral that makes for a 
sweet and moving conclusion to the 1988 film 
wellacted and wellwritten rocket gibralter would make a 
good introduction to a discussion with older children about death 
it also has a lovely soundtrack of original billie holiday songs

love season orpheus alex bugnon 
 
the first cut on love season keyboardist alex bugnons 
debut album is fantastic a playful strutting number that jumps 
out from the speakers with a shout of joy 
that the rest of the album fails to live up to going out is 
less the fault of the material than the high standard set by the 
lead song the seven other songs on love season are pretty 
good too 
going out should be required listening for anyone who thinks 
maybe with good reason that most jazz fusion music is too 
sterile and mechanical music for admiring rather than enjoying 
bugnon brings a lot of humanity and feeling to his music and 
avoids allowing his varied influences his background includes 
classical jazz gospel and rock to meld into faceless mush as 
they say this guys got personality 
the album shifts effortlessly from elegant to allout jams with 
high points including a sharp version of the brenda russell hit 
piano in the dark the funky falling for you and magie 
noire a percussion and synthesizer party

conviction blue wave hamell on trial 
 
ed hamell has a chip on his shoulder and a gift for melody two 
things that ought to add up to great rock n roll what he lacks 
and what sinks his group hamell on trials debut album is a sense 
of humor 
with a tight fourpiece band led by hamells brilliant acoustic 
guitar playing conviction attacks such things as liars drugs 
and mtv and muses on the pain of love at 100 words per minute the 
album also sets what must be some sort of record by having two 
songs containing references to boxer mike tyson 
but after opening with the bright pop of looking for you 
hamell on trial overdoes it with the heaviness and its not just 
the lyrics the performances which include talking blues and 
straightout rock with folk overtones have a veinsintheneck 
intensity 
listen to some of the great angry artists of rock lennon 
dylan costello for example and youll get the seriousness 
balanced with some humor and compassion that mix is part of what 
made the songs work but its an approach that has not been grasped 
here 
even when hamells pledging his love things get a bit 
overwrought in when youre alone he sings if i were 
michael tyson standing in the ring knowing that i neednt fear 
another living thing id be standing there shiny black and 
proud id see you in the audience id lift you from the crowd if 
you needed it some night when youre alone 
lighten up ed 
the power displayed on conviction indicates hammell on trial 
has what it takes to make a good record well have to tune in next 
time to see if they actually do it

remember william hurts sister in the 
accidental tourist the one who marries his boss 
or amy irvings friend in crossing delancey the one who has 
the baby 
what about holly hunters fellow beauty contestant in miss 
firecracker the one whose piano recital is ruined by tim robbins 
picture an actress with big brown eyes strawberry blond hair 
and a wide smile specializing in offbeat characters she has 
appeared in john hustons wise blood and woody allens 
stardust memories as well as breaking away the deer 
hunter and the amityville horror 
her name is amy wright and her experiences on film sets are not 
of 18hour days or endless retakes but of finding ways to fill 
free time 
she can relate well to the character in the longrunning 
offbroadway play the fantasticks who pronounces there are 
no small actors only small parts 
on accidental tourist we had two weeks of rehearsal and 
that was wonderful the actress recalled then we started 
shooting and i just sat around i wasnt needed except here and 
there thats the way it goes 
i wanted to be at work i didnt want to be sitting in a hotel 
reading i got a lot of reading done but i thought what am i 
doing my life is passing me by and im just sitting here at 
least in a play youre busy all the time 
for crossing delancey she had to make due with a limited 
role 
i didnt do a whole biography of where she was born and how 
she got to that point in her life wright said of her character 
you have a little baby in your arms you go to a bris you have 
your friends you can just imagine all that some things you can 
just easily identify with 
but wrights career is picking up critics praised her 
performance in the accidental tourist and the actress could 
gain wider recognition this fall when she appears opposite jeff 
daniels in love hurts 
i think that more people know who i am wright said of her 
recent string of hit films now they can connect the name and the 
face i have a good reputation 
her decision to become an actress was a bit of an accident 
itself wright a native of chicago grew up in a house without a 
tv set and had little interest in film or stage but as a senior in 
high school she became inspired 
i had a mad crush on this fellow at the university of chicago 
he was an actor an undergraduate student he had a friend who was 
making 16 mm movies and i used to hang around 
we went to this acting workshop and the teacher told me i was 
really good she said why dont you try out for plays at your 
school or come here and try out 
the crush eventually faded but she caught the acting bug and 
appeared in several high school plays after majoring in theater 
arts at beloit college wright moved to stockbridge mass and 
taught high school 
it served its purpose she said it was a step into the 
real world it was halfway there i was always able to do summer 
stock and get a pretty good workout then i went to rockville 
ill where a friend of mine had started the new american theatre 
which is still going strong 
wright moved to new york in 1974 and appeared on broadway in 
lanford wilsons 5th of july she also became friends with 
director martha coolidge and made her film debut in coolidges 
documentary feature not a pretty picture 
parts in girlfriends breaking away and the deer 
hunter quickly followed in 1980 she had a featured role in 
wise blood playing the sly sabbath lily hawks in hustons 
adaptation of the flannery oconnor story wright considers the 
film her favorite and enjoyed working with the director 
it was very nice she said wed start about 8 in the 
morning and finish about 4 or 5 in the afternoon if you got him 
telling stories that was the best he believed that if you cast 
the right person 90 percent of his job was done as far as the 
performance was concerned he didnt like to tell actors what to 
do 
but wise blood was a boxoffice failure and for the next 
five years wright worked exclusively in theater 
there have been some hard times when i was wondering what 
should i do instead with my life something more fulfilling than 
waiting around for the phone to ring 
she appeared on broadway in michael frayns noises off and 
made a valuable contact with joan micklin silver who directed 
crossing delancey 
it gave me a boost to get that job wright said itd been 
a long time it gave me confidence then reading for director 
larry kasden and accidental tourist i thought oh this is 
great 
she has finally dropped the dreaded status of between parts 
things are better said wright you have to make the 
poeple think youre really sought after or they think well shes 
not getting offers so im not going to offer anything either

thomas dunlays struggle to learn the traditional 
techniques of painting led him to despair 17 years ago and 
thoughts of a career change after all no one was interested in 
classical realism teachers were scarce and collectors even fewer 
but he stuck with traditional painting training in the style of 
the once popular boston school and as cultural tastes turn from 
the unrestrained moods of modernism to the craftsmanship of the 
traditional arts dunlay and other boston school painters now are 
thriving 
the tall husky 37yearold artists earnings have reached six 
figures in recent years and dunlays paintings are selling faster 
than he can paint them 
last year his winter snowfall a familiar scene of bostons 
public garden at dusk sold for 100000 now dunlay has been 
commissioned by a former state department official to paint the 
white house rose garden 
traditional painting has come back very very strong it is 
here to stay dunlay said there is only one major problem 
that is that so much of the craft and the language has been lost 
except for a handful of people in the world it may be lost 
forever 
the boston school considered to be the longest continuing style 
of traditional painting that survives today brings together the 
sharp images of american realism with the bright colors of 
impressionism about 40 painters around the nation and in europe 
consider themselves boston school painters disciples of a 
tradition that developed here in the 19th century 
the aims and values of the boston school are evident in winter 
snowfall a view of pedestrians in winter garb traversing the 
bridge over the public gardens duck pond as the bridges lights 
bob against shadowy images of distant office buildings 
the oftenreproduced painting hung for about a year in the 
exclusive st botolph club before communications mogul david mugar 
paid 100000 for it last year dunlay said he receives calls every 
day from people wishing to purchase it 
it became a kind of popular icon through these christmas cards 
and reproductions and prints that were sold said william coles 
a noted boston art historian 
at the outset of world war i several major boston school 
painters established the guild of boston artists the cooperative 
gallery proved to be one of the most successful in the city and is 
still operating 
boston was a natural source of strong traditional painting 
according to coles john singer sargent and john singleton copley 
noted painters with ties to the european art community made their 
homes here 
boston was always a center for painting from the 18th century 
on major painters like copley and gilbert stewart worked here and 
also worked in england so they had international connections and 
expertise coles said 
at the end of the 18th century the new values of the french 
school began to influence boston painters studying abroad but 
coles said it was the boston museum of fine arts establishment of 
a school in 1876 that entrenched boston painters in european 
training 
the boston school emphasized accurate drawing which combined 
with the impressionists use of color to produce a realism that was 
more pleasing to the eye than the somber tones of other traditional 
styles such as renaissance painting but from the great depression 
to world war ii traditional painting in the united states reached 
its nadir and modernism with its disregard for form and line grew 
in prominence 
it had a very destructive effect because the whole traditional 
curriculum of the schools began to fall apart and the focus was 
really on selfexpression rather than on training coles said 
dunlay was a victim of the art school rebellion the traditional 
training he sought was unavailable when he entered the 
massachusetts college of art in 1969 
at that point there was a real movement to suppress anything 
to do with traditional painting dunlay said the teachers 
tried to ridicule me into leaving quitting painting because i 
wasnt interested in expressing myself in terms of modern 
attitudes 
frustrated by repeated confrontations with his instructors 
dunlay left the mca and searched for a painter with whom to study 
when he had nearly given up he discovered a key figure in the 
transition from the old boston school to todays boston school 
painters rh ives gammell 
gammell set up an atelier in bostons fenway neighborhood when 
he foresaw the potential collapse of accurate drawing and 
traditional painting in the 1930s until his death in 1981 he had 
dozens of pupils many of whom are working today in minneapolis 
ft lauderdale fla and florence italy and other cities 
as paintings began to fetch higher prices so did the works of 
the original boston school painters especially since their works 
can now be evaluated at a distance by collectors and historians 
works by artists such as edmond tarbell that could have been 
purchased for very little in the 1960s today sell for more than 1 
million 
i deal with people who just love the pictures dunlay said 
theyre not buying for snob appeal theyre not buying them 
because theyre fashionable theyre buying them because they just 
plain like them 
coles attributed much of the success todays boston painters are 
enjoying to the new respectability of the old generation and a 
return to traditional values in painting 
i think you find now in art schools a movement back to 
figure drawing forty years ago nobody wanted that discipline 
he said and of course traditional genres like figure painting 
and landscape painting are now much more popular and they appear in 
galleries

rock n roll has always meant the unexpected 
for tom petty even when he was growing up in gainesville fla 
rock n roll came over me like a fever that i never got rid 
of he recalled in a recent interview consumed me like a 
poison completely consumed me to where i can honestly say i 
didnt think of anything else it was all i could do think or 
anything 
it made for a terrible home life my family didnt understand 
my father thought i was mental i understand why because i was very 
obsessed with it it was an alternative to working i had no 
opportunity for anything in my life with where i lived and what i 
was up against 
he was a nonmusical child who discovered a knack for guitar a 
quiet skinny kid who never dreamed of being famous petty was soon 
playing in local bands 
youd go and see some other kid whose hair was long this was 
around 65 and go wow theres one like me youd go over and 
talk and hed say ive got a drum set you do great that was 
my whole life still is im afraid 
the traveling wilburys was a surprise the result of a jam 
session with george harrison jeff lynne the late roy orbison and 
bob dylan that grew into a bestselling album pettys new record 
full moon fever was an accident as well 
late in 1987 he pulled up to a traffic light in los angeles and 
in the next car spotted lynne who had just produced harrisons 
cloud nine lp 
jeff and george both started to come to my house a lot and 
wed just sit around and play petty said one day i was 
showing jeff this song id written and he suggested some changes 
it was really good input we wrote another one and thought wed put 
it on tape while he was in town 
they headed over to the house of mike campbell a guitarist in 
pettys band the heartbreakers and went to work 
we did the first couple and thought it was pretty good that 
maybe we should keep on working cmon jeff do one more now just 
one more 
full moon fever is pettys ninth album and first without 
the heartbreakers although campbell and keyboardist belmont tench 
contributed lynne helped produce the record and cowrote eight of 
the 12 songs 
jeffs brilliant said petty who will tour with the 
heartbreakers this summer hes certainly one of the top two or 
three people ive ever seen in the studio hes growing as an 
artist by leaps and bounds much better than a lot of the people 
that we hold up as great rock heroes 
petty makes no secret of his love for the byrds his vocals and 
12string rickenbacker guitar have made some of his songs notably 
american girl sound almost uncannily like the 1960s folkrock 
group 
on full moon fever he does a notefornote cover of the 
byrds feel a whole lot better the song was recorded 
naturally on a spurofthemoment decision 
we were in the studio and had seen former byrd roger mcguinn 
play the song we started playing it and said lets cut it i 
thought well its my solo album ill put it on i dont care 
i couldnt think of how else to do it he laughed ive 
stolen so much from them already 
petty has had his share of unpleasant surprises when mca bought 
out his first label shelter in 1978 he angrily filed suit for 
artistic control and eventually settled out of court after a 
lengthy battle in 1981 he fought to lower the list price on his 
hard promises album forcing mca to release the record at 898 
instead of 998 while recording southern accents which came 
out in 1985 he punched a wall and broke his hand an injury that 
took a year and a half to heal 
then pettys house in los angeles burned down destroying 
everything he owned 
im very cynical he admitted i try to temper that 
somewhat because its no fun to be cynical all the time and also 
not very productive you try to be as positive as you can in the 
world of these days 
but along came the wilburys 
i felt maybe in a way some cosmic way that was given to me 
to compensate for the house petty said the nice thing about 
the wilburys other than it being a great album was i made some 
very good friends people that are very much a big part of my life 
if jeff and george didnt play a guitar or anything id still love 
them very much 
it was very refreshing one of the nicest things thats ever 
happened to me 
much of full moon fever was recorded before the wilburys 
album and features pettys familiar contrast of upbeat music and 
wary sometimes bleak lyrics 
i wont back down the first single follows the pattern of 
pettys aor standard refugee maintaining hope in an unhappy 
world 
its sort of the classic theme of a lot of the work ive done 
i think faith is very important just to get through life i think 
its really important that you believe in yourself first of all 
its a very hard to thing to come by but when you get it its 
invaluable 
more often pettys lyrics are about betrayal you gotta be 
careful what you dream he warns on a thing about you a 
track off hard promises in depending on you another song 
from full moon fever he pleads with his girlfriend to trust 
him not to let him down 
when you love somebody you become very dependent on them 
whether you like it or not sometimes its a very scary thing 
ive been an independent person in a lot of ways but you 
realize how dependent you are on the people you love on your 
friends your pals youre dependent on them i dont believe i can 
make it all alone

even with sales of over 30 million books 
frederick forsyth the author of the day of the jackal and 
the fourth protocol insists he does not like to write 
its partly because im not a compulsive writer like some of 
my colleagues explained the 50yearold british author i try 
and take a period off between books and do something that has 
nothing do do with books 
when forsyth does force himself to the typewriter he maintains 
a strict schedule rise around 7 am at his desk by 8 reread the 
previous chapters start writing at 9 continue until his daily 
ration of 12 pages is completed 
the books usually take 45 months to research 67 weeks to 
write and arrive faithfully every 5 years the results are just as 
predictable tightly constructed easytoread spy thrillers that 
blend historical figures and fictional characters 
its the story that identifies what i have to research 
forsyth said i work out the story first beginning middle and 
end chapter and verse right down to almost the smallest 
details 
originally a journalist forsyth chooses an international topic 
of interest and carefully works out every plot twist making sure 
to establish a logical motivation for each of his characters 
the devils alternative published in 1979 anticipated the 
fall of the shah of iran and the rise of a female prime minister in 
great britain for his latest novel the negotiator 1995 
bantam forsyth imagines the world shaken by a major energy 
crisis the idea came while forsyth was lunching with a friend 
he said theres a feasibility of our running out of oil 
forsyth said the saudis are going to own us out of 41 producer 
nations 31 are scheduled to run out within 20 years six of the 10 
remaining are from the middle east thats power 
i saw that russia is due to run out in nine years that 
started my thought processes what the hell are they going to do 
theyre in more dire straights then we were 
the plot centers on the kidnapping of college student simon 
cormack the son of john cormack the president of the united 
states who has agreed to a sweeping arms reduction deal with soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev 
desperate us officials turn to an embittered former hostage 
negotiator quinn to attain the young cormacks release 
in a book filled with presidents prime ministers and 
millionaire businessmen forsyth considered it essential to 
structure the story around quinn 
its difficult for the public to identify with a big 
organization or a big government ministry he said we prefer 
to empathize with one individual the guy who stands up to the 
establishment 
the only way a man would have that capacity to act as a loner 
would be that role if hes for the fbi hes going to be on strings 
to superior officers if hes cia its the same thing 
he used the same approach for his first book the day of the 
jackal which came out in 1971 
french president charles de gaulle had been under harsh 
criticism in the early 1960s for favoring the independence of 
algeria and several assassination attempts were made by the oas 
organisation de larmee secrete 
it just occurred to me that they werent getting anywhere near 
him because they were infiltrated recalled forsyth a french 
correspondent for reuters at the time french counterintelligence 
got so many people in oas they were being blown away 
he decided to write a book about a hired assassins attempt 
code name the jackal to kill de gaulle 
i just dashed it off in a break between journalistic 
assignments thinking i might make a quick 1000 even my 
publishers huntington viking they decided they were going to 
print 5000 copies thinking that was a very good print run 
the novel sold millions of copies was translated into 11 
languages and won the mystery writers of america edgar allan poe 
award he was immediately comissioned to write two more books 
leaving behind his career in journalism 
i thought it was like playing football said forsyth who 
followed up jackal with the odessa file and the dogs of 
war 
if the ball suddenly arrives in your hands dont just stand 
there staring at the stadium run you may crash but go for it

little casey schlitz whose dad is a 
songwriter had just learned the lords prayer and got into the 
habit of saying forever and ever amen at the end of everything 
he said 
schlitz and a hot singersongwriter named paul overstreet 
started tinkering with what the 4yearold said and turned it into 
the 1988 grammywinner forever and ever amen which was 
recorded by country star randy travis and became one of the biggest 
hits in recent years 
we started monkeying around with it and before you knew it 
it started being fun overstreet recalled it was done in an 
hour and a half or so and we had an idea who should sing it 
it was a unique way to say something at that time but it 
didnt give me chills the first time i heard it a lot of the 
success was due to randy travis popularity at the time 
overstreet was surprised to win a grammy for the song 
i dont think its sunk in yet to be recognized with the big 
boys thats the big leagues there being a country boy from down 
in mississippi and going to new york for the grammy show it was 
pretty neat it was an opportunity you dont get every day 
sixteen years ago overstreet who was born in newton miss 
and raised in vancleave arrived in nashville without a job and 
homeless he slept in an empty church until he could find work as a 
welder then he finally broke into the music business writing and 
singing in the past three years hes probably been the top 
songwriter in country music 
he wrote on the other hand also recorded by travis which 
was voted song of the year in 1987 by both the country music 
association and the academy of country music and he wrote or 
cowrote a string of other country hits diggin up bones and 
deeper than the holler both recorded by travis when you say 
nothing at all recorded by the late keith whitley same ole 
me by george jones youre still new to me by marie osmond 
and paul davis one love at a time by tanya tucker and i 
fell in love last night by the forester sisters 
as a recording artist his debut rca album sowin love has 
produced two hit singles this year the title cut plus love helps 
those 
the 34yearold overstreet has also tackled an alcohol and drug 
problem and says hes found an inner peace after quitting 
substances four years ago thats when his songwriting career also 
blossomed 
im in a real peaceful place with myself right now he said 
i still expect quite a bit from myself but i feel im in the 
right place on the right road and ill progress as time goes on 
this is the first time in my life i can actually say im on the 
right road i feel im building in the right direction 
he used cocaine and developed a reputation as one of the biggest 
boozers in music industry hangouts i drank til it was over 
he recalled it was a miserable time 
i definitely was wasting my talent i didnt finish songs i 
didnt have the energy to work i was operating at 25 to 50 percent 
of my capabilities on an average 
in his songwriting he tries to convey positive messages and 
talk about lifes potentials 
ive tried to say things in songs to encourage people rather 
than take advantage of weaknesses overstreet said i try to 
see things that would help people see how things could be 
i try to sew a lot of that into the songs its a real 
complicated process ill think of something in a way ive never 
looked at it before then i can formulate the two ends together 
with the chorus in the middle 
i try to paint the picture set the story im developing 
around the idea at that point the lyrics and music kind of come 
together 
and thats how forever and ever amen happened 
a memorable line from the song is as long as old men sit and 
talk about the weather as long as old women sit and talk about old 
men 
thats pretty plain overstreet said its real it hit 
the heart of a lot of people

elvy musikka begins most days like she 
ends them smoking a legal joint and hoping others like her can do 
the same some day 
either rolled like a cigarette or baked into brownies marijuana 
has been in musikkas life for more than 12 years as she tried to 
lessen the effects of glaucoma which has left her with only 10 
percent of her sight 
yet she clearly sees herself as a crusader for the thousands of 
glaucoma victims around the united states denied legal use of the 
drug that reduces the high eye pressure caused by the disease 
i think people have every right to sue the government for 
keeping them from what could be their one hope left of keeping 
their sight said musikka 44 one of three people given 
governmentgrown marijuana for medical reasons 
i am constantly haunted by the idea there are others who will 
never see the stars again or look upon their children because they 
were denied a simple plant 
musikkas application for legal marijuana was approved by the 
us food and drug administration in october two months after a 
broward circuit court judge was persuaded to clear her of 
marijuanagrowing charges 
each month musikka receives 300 marijuana cigarettes shipped to 
bascom palmer eye institute in miami 
if she smokes its a joint every three hours but actually i 
prefer to eat it said musikka you feel less stoned and it 
lasts longer i can eat some pot brownies and go about 12 hours 
also your throat doesnt get so raspy but thats ok if you want 
to sing some blues 
musikka has turned to music since her limited sight keeps her 
from working she now travels around florida discussing marijuana 
treatment for glaucoma and promoting her newly released foursong 
record partially funded by a 6000 grant from the state division 
of blind services 
the songs two in english and two in spanish are among lyrics 
and melodies she began after her glaucoma worsened in 1976 i was 
scared to death of going totally blind the music was a way to keep 
my mind off my problems 
musikka has a scrapbook with the cover photograph showing her 
beside a bushy marijuana plant in 1984 the pages are covered with 
clippings about her legal fight and her clandestine days growing 
her own marijuana 
in 1976 she conducted an interview under a pseudonym for a 
newspaper in her hometown of hollywood about 15 miles north of 
miami when friends realized musikka was the subject of the story 
they began bringing her marijuana 
it was great because i was raising two kids and couldnt 
afford to keep a supply on my own but i decided to grow my own to 
save some money and at least have some always on hand the 
problem was keeping out animals birds cats and dogs they seem 
to love it one time my puppy ate a whole plant he slept for a 
couple hours but otherwise he was alright 
for nearly 10 years musikka grew several marijuana plants on 
the deck of her screenenclosed pool a roommate in february 1988 
tipped police and musikka spent a night in jail before being bailed 
out her case drew wide publicity and support from two others 
allowed legal marijuana glaucoma sufferer bob randall and south 
florida stockbroker irvin rosenfeld who has a rare disease that 
causes tumors in his bones 
randall president of the alliance for cannabis therapeutics in 
washington said musikka is only the third person to be guaranteed 
a supply of marijuana 
i cant explain why the government is withholding marijuana 
while people are going blind said musikka 
fda spokeswoman susan cruzan said no figures are available on 
the number of people given marijuana under medical experiments 
including cancer patients who use it to counteract the nausea from 
chemotherapy

fifty years after commercial television made 
its flickering debut at the new york worlds fair the passion of a 
gangly teenager who made it possible is finally being requited 
its high time said elma pem farnsworth who for 44 
years was sounding board sweetheart lab assistant and wife to 
philo taylor farnsworth 
but she wasnt his first love television was 
farnsworth who died in 1971 was 15 years old in 1922 when he 
diagrammed his idea for an electronic tv system on a high school 
blackboard in this eastern idaho farming town 
chemistry teacher justin tolmans memory of that drawing 
including the first description of an electronic image 
dissector tv camera tube helped farnsworth win the first in a 
series of patent battles with rca over early tv technology in the 
1930s 
but if farnsworth won the battles rca won the war outside 
idaho and his native utah most history and reference books place 
him on the sidelines among other pioneers who contributed to 
televisions development 
most of the glory went to vladimir zworykin the 
russianamerican inventor who developed the iconoscope and 
kinescope during a career primarily with rca farnsworth who 
received some 160 patents finally was inducted into the national 
inventors hall of fame in 1984 seven years after zworykin 
were going to set the record straight across the country 
said kent farnsworth the inventors son 
utah gov norm bangerter proclaimed may 2 philo t farnsworth 
day kicking off a fundraising effort for a bronze statue of 
farnsworth in national statuary hall it is scheduled for placement 
may 2 1990 in the us capitol 
farnsworth who was born in the southwestern utah town of 
beaver was picked for the honor by the utah legislature at the 
urging of a salt lake city elementary school class that researched 
a number of famous utahns 
people kind of like a guy whos an underdog said bruce 
barnson principal at ridgecrest elementary heres a guy who was 
brilliant came up with television and really got nothing out of 
it 
in rigby the farnsworth television group is raising money for a 
tv museum to highlight his achievements there already are signs on 
us 20 leading into the town of 2600 proclaiming rigby the 
birthplace of television 
the community center in a former bank building has a 
collection of farnsworth memorabilia in what used to be a vault 
last year it featured the emmy he won posthumously in 1978 for his 
contributions to tv technology 
mrs farnsworth now 81 recently wrote an essay about her 
husband for people magazine criticizing rca chief david sarnoffs 
effort to control the television industry just like hed 
controlled radio 
that theme is explored further in a book mrs farnsworth hopes 
to publish titled distant vision romance and discovery on an 
invisible frontier 
she recounts how the financial strain of legal disputes with rca 
forced the farnsworth television amp radio corp to the verge of 
bankruptcy and finally to sell out to international telephone amp 
telegraph in 1949 
but edward w herold a former rca researcher and retired 
director of the electronics research laboratory at the david 
sarnoff research center in princeton nj said jabs at sarnoff 
zworykin or rca are misplaced 
i think farnsworth got plenty of credit from the historians 
more than he deserves he was really a genius a really bright 
guy herold said 
farnsworth was a competitor and a good competitor but i 
would say he was eventually overwhelmed by the number of brilliant 
people we had at rca 
farnsworth who continued research in physics after selling the 
business developed an early electron microscope to study the 
uniformity of the phosphor coating on tubes in the image dissector 
his work also helped in development of nightvision scopes radar 
and an incubator for premature babies 
he was at brigham young university at the time of his death 
working on an area of physics that science has yet to conquer 
nuclear fusion 
mrs farnsworth said new attention to his life should be an 
example to a new generation of discoverers phil was told 
television was impossible by everyone he talked to about it im 
hoping this will encourage young people to stick by their guns and 
not be dissuaded by anyone

healthconscious consumers are demanding 
foods that are low in salt but taking it out of cheese does more 
than change the taste it can allow some bacteria to flourish 
making the food unsafe 
fermentation in cheese is tolerant of salt but the bacteria 
that makes us sick dont tolerate salt said steve taylor 
director of the university of nebraskalincoln food processing 
center 
under a grant from the wisconsin milk marketing board through 
the university of wisconsin taylor and assistant professor robert 
hutkins will study bacteria growth in lowsalt cheddar cheese 
produced by food chemist bob lindsay at the madison wis school 
wisconsin researcher eric johnson will test the cheese for 
clostridium botulinum the toxin that causes botulism poisoning 
which can be fatal in humans 
no ones ever got botulism from cheese for two reasons 
taylor said one is salt and the second is moisture content 
there is not much likelihood that it would grow but the industry 
will say prove it then we will consider this product and 
thats basically the reason for the study

idaho falls idaho thousands of pounds of radioactive waste 
buried beneath the idaho national engineering laboratory will be 
melted into glass and chemical vapors sucked from the ground in 
tests starting in august 
for in situ vitrification electrodes will be buried and 5 
megawatts of electricity will heat the soil to more than 3600 
degrees fahrenheit trapping the hazardous waste in an inert 
glassy substance like pyrex pans 
the department of energy has used vitrification at its savannah 
river nuclear site in south carolina and the environmental 
protection agency uses it at a nonradioactive waste site in ohio 
the estimated 350 million it would cost to vitrify wastes 
buried here from 1954 to 1970 compares with an estimated 1 billion 
to 2 billion for removal shipment and storage said project 
manager janice landon 
in 1987 the doe found organic vapors in the ground below the 
waste complex and determined there wer thousands of gallons of 
carbon tetrachloride a cleaning solvent and other materials 
workers will drill about 260 feet through basalt this summer and 
install a ground vapor extraction system to suck out up to 500 
cubic feet a minute of the vapors the gases will be passed through 
a filter to remove radioactive particles and through a charcoal bed 
to remove organic components 
tests will run for four months beginning aug 1 at a cost of 
630000 
the process has been used elsewhere to clean up gasoline leaks 
but this is the first time it would be tested that deep in the 
ground officials said the state and the epa must approve the use 
of the vapor system

the current strategy for vaccinating against 
hepatitis b has not significantly curbed the disease and it may 
make sense to inoculate every infant and 12yearold instead a 
federal expert says 
that would cost up to 150 million a year just for publicly 
funded programs said miriam alter head of hepatitis surveillance 
at the centers for disease control in atlanta hepatitis b 
infections cost the nation more than 700 million a year in 
treatment and lost worktime 
no costeffectiveness analysis of the massive vaccination 
approach has been done but thats what we think is the ideal 
strategy alter said 
cdc is not now recommending it because no money is available 
and much organizing among pediatricians parents and local health 
departments would be required before it could begin she said in an 
interview adding she hoped it could be put in place someday 
soon 
an estimated 300000 new hepatitis b infections occur every year 
in the united states said alter the annual number of new cases 
rose 67 percent from 1978 to 1985 although a vaccine became 
available in 1982 some 5000 to 6000 americans a year die from 
resulting liver disease including chronic hepatitis cirrhosis and 
cancer 
vaccination is now recommended for people in highrisk groups 
because the virus can be spread by sexual contact or infected 
hypodermic needles those at risk include homosexually active men 
heterosexuals with multiple sex partners health care workers drug 
abusers and those who have sex with infected people 
although about 25 million americans have been vaccinated alter 
said the effort has done little to stem the disease at least 30 
percent of the infected people dont come from any of the highrisk 
groups and most inoculations have been given to health care 
workers who comprised no more than 5 percent of hepatitis b cases 
even before the vaccine was available she said

paul gabriel bailey holc is a big name for a little boy but it 
honors those who gave him a big gift life 
paul holc was known to the world simply as baby paul when he was 
born 1 years ago with an underdeveloped heart that was replaced by 
dr leonard bailey with the walnutsized heart of baby gabriel 
born with virtually no brain 
to leave such a legacy you cant be anything but proud to 
know theres another little child alive even though theres no hope 
for your own child i swell up i just feel so good said karen 
schouten whose daughter was named after the archangel gabriel the 
herald of good news 
bailey too is proud of being part of pauls life i feel 
hes touched down in all of our lives in different kinds of ways 
theres no dark side to this story that i can perceive 
others do see a dark side however and because of the 
controversy surrounding the use of the doomed anencephalic infants 
as organ donors pauls transplant was the last 
some experts contend the babies should be used because they will 
die within days and many infant organs are needed critics say 
keeping them on respirators just for their organs is inhumane and a 
frightening precedent 
karen schouten and alice holc have never met or even talked to 
one another but the two mothers react similarly in the face of 
such condemnation 
it doesnt bother me because i understand you cant please 
everybody all the time theres always a group of people who are 
going to disagree and want to play the devils advocate on any 
issue mrs holc said from her home near vancouver british 
columbia what bothers me is when a group of ethicists delve 
into it and they dont really seem to know all the facts 
they dont even know what an anencephalic baby looks like 
there is no hope for these infants who are born dying and there 
can be no mistake doctors say in identifying them 
victims of anencephaly are born with a brain stem which 
controls breathing and neurological reflexes but no cerebral 
hemispheres and only a partial skull because there is brainstem 
activity they are not brain dead legally a necessary condition 
before organs can be removed for transplantation 
anencephaly is believed to result from failure of the neural 
tube to fuse in the uppermost portion of the brain during the first 
month of pregnancy like other neural tube defects the overall 
incidence is decreasing mainly because of prenatal diagnosis that 
often leads to abortion 
about half the 1000 to 2000 anencephalic babies born each year 
in the united states are stillborn said dr muin khoury of the 
centers for disease controls birth defects branch the rest die 
within a few days or a week at most and so receive only comfort 
care food water and warmth 
without lifesupport systems their hearts and livers 
deteriorate because of insufficient oxygen and are useless for 
transplantation kidneys though damaged still might be viable 
meanwhile 243 children under age 5 were awaiting organs in 
early may 24 of them under age 1 according to the united network 
for organ sharing which administers the national organ procurement 
and transplantation network 
experts estimate as many as half of those under age 2 die 
waiting 
the problem is you cannot find baby donors because children 
routinely dont die under the circumstances of brain death you 
dont get a child who goes out on friday night has a few beers and 
gets in a car accident said brian broznick executive director 
of the pittsburgh transplant foundation 
the shortage prompted bailey of loma linda university medical 
center to transplant a baboon heart into a 12dayold girl known 
as baby fae in 1984 she died 20 days later amid public uproar the 
operation was never repeated 
experts disagree on whether anencephalic babies feel pain and 
whether artificially prolonging life might pressure parents into 
continuing a pregnancy solely for organ donation critics fear who 
else could become targets 
once you start defining one set of human beings as being 
somehow less human than the rest of us where the heck are you 
going to draw the line asked leslie bond associate editor of 
the national right to life news 
jen molnar of cincinnati whose anencephalic son jeremy lived 
three days in 1985 also worries about this slippery slope 
that respirator serves no purpose for that child to live the 
only purpose it serves is to promote them as an organ farm she 
said 
the notion of anencephalics as organ donors has gotten so 
bound up in philosophical notions that weve kind of lost the 
central focus that is salvaging organs bailey said we 
certainly cant salvage anencephalics were very likely to 
structure the use of the salvage of organs in such a way that all 
the other baggage isnt of vital concern 
i dont see it as being such a huge issue that human beings 
cant come to grips with it in realistic terms and pragmatic terms 
in ways that would enrich us as a society 
loma linda had no official policy on anencephalic newborns when 
alice holc learned in 1987 that the left ventricle of her babys 
heart was underdeveloped a condition that would kill him soon 
after birth in an unprecedented move the unborn child was placed 
on a transplant waiting list 
meanwhile mrs schouten and her husband fred of barrie 
ontario had approached canadian doctors about donating the organs 
of their unborn daughter diagnosed in the womb as anencephalic 
we wanted to have some good come from this mrs schouten 
explained 
paul born by caesarean section was just three hours old on 
oct 16 1987 when baileys surgical team made him the worlds 
youngest organ recipient

fred schouten died two months later of a heart attack at age 36 
and his wife said donating gabriels heart gives me the ability 
to smile when i think about her and him instead of cry 
also in december 1987 loma linda established a procedure for 
accepting anencephalic infants as prospective organ donors the 
babies would be placed on respirators for up to seven days awaiting 
cessation of brain stem function 
the california medical centers program was established at the 
urging of many parents of anencephalic infants most notably brenda 
and michael winner of arcadia calif who were determined to share 
their unborn daughters organs 
but jarren winner was stillborn on dec 22 1987 dashing their 
hopes she was cremated and her ashes placed in a silver urn 
decorated with turquoise her birthstone the urn is prominently 
displayed on a living room shelf 
i was very proud of her from the neck down she was 
perfect said mrs winner 33 who is writing a book titled ten 
perfect fingers 
above the neck though jarren was fatally flawed 
if you go right above the forehead and saw off the back of her 
head thats what it looks like mrs winner said it was all 
open it looked like liver in a butcher market with the brain 
stem protruding 
loma linda suspended its program last july after only two of 12 
babies met brain death standards neither became a donor one 
because the organs were no longer viable and the other because no 
suitable recipient was found 
twelve infants were sufficient to show us this is not a 
feasible technique or solution to the infant organ shortage said 
dr joyce peabody loma lindas chief of neonatology 
childrens hospital of western ontario where gabriel was born 
put its program on hold in march two of the next three 
respiratorsustained infants were not brain dead within the 
required week a 5dayold girls liver was sent to the united 
states but the recipient needed another transplant said dr 
timothy frewen director of pediatric critical care 
with such a low incidence of brain death frewen and other 
doctors wonder if the issue is worth pursuing the canadian 
pediatric society plans to make a recommendation at its annual 
meeting this month a task force of five us medical societies 
expects to publish a report this year 
the united network for organ sharings directors in february 
declined to impose a moratorium but adopted a policy discouraging 
use of anencephalic organs at least until further study 
society and the medical profession to some extent have learned 
following baby gabriels experience frewen said without 
accumulating experience one cant say one way or another 
worldwide 80 anencephalic infants have been accepted as 
prospective donors since the 1960s said dr david stumpf 
professor of pediatrics and neurology at northwestern university 
and coordinator of the us task force fortyone became donors 
providing 37 kidneys two livers and three hearts transplants were 
successful in 11 kidney cases and one heart case pauls 
of six such kidney transplants at childrens hospital medical 
center in cincinnati only one recipient still has the original 
anencephalic organs said dr paul mcenery head of the kidney 
transplant program 
that patient brian bourgraf now 25 and an assistant credit 
manager for a wilmington ohio hardware manufacturer received new 
kidneys in 1968 
if that person was here as hes looking down hes probably 
saying im glad i did it he said his parents are more than 
glad because theyve seen whats come out of it 
bourgraf frequently is cited by supporters of proposed ohio 
legislation to establish braindeath category solely for 
anencephalic infants that is based on their ability to breathe 
without lifesupport systems similar measures have been considered 
in new jersey and california 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota suspects a significant number of 
parents would donate their anencephalic babies organs if they 
could 
karen schouten agrees when you see a little baby like paul it 
makes it all worthwhile

the italian telecommunications equipment maker 
italtel on monday signed an agreement with american telephone amp 
telegraph co for a farreaching partnership in manufacturing and 
sales of equipment 
under the accord atampt will acquire 20 percent of italtel in 
exchange italtels parent the italian state holding company stet 
will take a 20 percent share of atamptnetwork systems international 
attnsi a joint venture between atampt and nv philips of the 
netherlands 
in addition atampt has agreed to make a direct investment of 
almost 150 million in italtel said an official involved in the 
deal who requested anonymity 
the accord which was widely expected was an important victory 
for atampt it allows the us giant access to the ripe italian 
telecommunications market which is dominated by italtel and 
improves atampts position for the post1992 unified european market 
stet and italtel hope to gain advanced technology investment 
and increased credibility through the alliance 
both atampt and italtel have only limited access to foreign 
markets at present 
although the value of the share swap wasnt disclosed at a news 
conference announcing the deal atampt chairman robert e allen said 
they balanced out in terms of value 
the cooperation agreement was signed following four months of 
detailed negotiations between atampt and stetitaltel 
atampt was selected as italtels partner over siemens ag of west 
germany alcatel nv of france and swedens telefon ab lm ericsson 
after a politically charged decisionmaking process that took more 
than a year 
allen said it was premature to estimate the value of the 
orders atampt expected to receive through the partnership 
but atampt is expected to win a big chunk of the nearly 26 
billion in orders for equipment and technology that the italian 
phone company sip has planned as part of a fiveyear investment 
plan 
the atamptitaltel agreement involves cooperation in research and 
development production the purchase of components sales 
installation and servicing in the fields of public switching 
transmission support systems and private telecommunications 
part of the accord provides for establishment of an 
equallyowned company to market a common catalogue of 
atamptitaltel telecommunications equipment to european and asian 
markets

grain and soybeans futures prices turned mixed 
after opening lower today on the chicago board of trade 
pressure came early on two fronts the first being the plentiful 
rain over the weekend in key growing areas for beans and corn the 
second reason was that the chinese thought to be in the market for 
as much as a million tons of grain would be postponing their buy 
political upheaval was generally regarded as the cause for the 
chinese decision not to come to the market at this time 
both the grains and beans however made a comeback within the 
first hour and turned mixed as new crop months gained at the 
expense of old crop months 
on the open wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 386 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to 1 cents lower with july 260 a bushel oats were 
cents higher to 1 cents higher with july at 171 a bushel and 
soybeans 1 were cent lower to 4 cents lower with july at 702 a 
bushel 
livestock and pork futures were mostly higher at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
live cattle were unchanged to 40 cent higher with june at 
6860 cents a pound feeder cattle were 50 cent to 93 cent higher 
with august at 7845 cents a pound live hogs were 07 cent lower 
to 40 cent higher with june at 4825 cents a pound and frozen 
pork bellies were 65 cent to 125 cents higher with july at 3155

a fish industry spokesman said today its 
ludicrous to claim deficiencies in seafood inspection make eating 
seafood more dangerous than eating fat 
but lee weddig executive vice president of the national 
fisheries institute said he favors improved seafood inspection as 
much as do consumer groups who made the claim 
when american try to improve their eating habits by cutting down 
on fat they often turn to fish 
unless legislation establishing a comprehensive mandatory 
seafood inspection program is enacted and signed in this congress 
those same healthconscious consumers will be putting themselves at 
increasing risk for serious illness even death said ellen haas 
spokeswoman for the consumer group public voice 
currently the food and drug administration has a shellfish 
sanitation program and a canned salmon control program which are 
both voluntary haas said 
the national marine fisheries service in the department of 
commerce has a voluntary inspection and grading program but it 
emphasizes uniformity of size flavor and freedom from blemishes 
it is not a public health program she said 
weddig and haas were among the witnesses who testified today 
before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations which is gathering information for possible fish 
inspection legislation 
while the agriculture department is in charge of most food 
inspection including livestock and poultry it does not inspect 
seafood haas said in an interview friday she said it would make 
sense to put such an inspection under the usda because it already 
has the structure 
weddig said he also favors usda inspection of seafood 
he said his organization went to congress in 1985 seeking an 
inspection program he said the national marine fisheries service 
has been working for two years on the best approach and will be 
making recommendations to congress 
these hearings are running parallel to that said weddig 
we hope they will come together 
but weddig said its ludicrous to make a claim such as that 
made by public voice he said the fish sold commercially is safe 
waters that are polluted mostly in the inland lakes have 
been closed to commercial fishing for years he said 
as for the salmon affected by the oil spill in alaska weddig 
said public officials were monitoring the catch carefully and would 
not allow anything to be sold that was not safe 
the subcommittee hearing chaired by rep john dingell dmich 
was the first congressional hearing on seafood since 1974 
haas said it came at a critical time 
annual consumption of seafood in the united states increased 
by over 20 percent between 1980 and 1987 and is now well over 3 
billion pounds she said 
haas said seafood has certain characteristics that increase 
health risks namely it comes from uncontrolled environments where 
bacteria and parasites dwell 
the waters from which fish are taken may be polluted with 
sewage industrial chemicals or pesticides she said in 
addition certain types of seafood such as shellfish actually 
concentrate contaminants in their tissue 
though cooking kills many causes of food poisoning fish often 
is eaten raw 
haas said that according to the federal centers for disease 
control statistics from 1973 to 1984 more people got sick from 
fish and shellfish than from beef and poultry combined 
she said the figures attain added significance when its 
realized that americans eat more than four times as much beef and 
three times as much poultry as they do of seafood 
public voice has been working with dingells subcommittee on the 
issue dingell said in march he hoped to have legislation prepared 
soon

several major banks lowered their prime lending 
rates half a percentage point to 11 percent today responding to 
the decline of interest rates on financial markets 
citibank the nations largest bank was the first to announce 
it had lowered its prime lending rate several other big banks 
including chase manhattan bank morgan guaranty trust co chemical 
bank manufacturers hanover trust co and bankers trust co 
quickly followed suit 
todays decline was the first drop in the prime rate used as a 
base for a variety of other interest rates including those on 
consumer loans since feb 2 1988 on that day the prime fell 
025 percentage points to 85 percent but then began a climb that 
ended today 
the latest decline places the prime rate back at the level it 
reached on feb 10 of this year when it rose to 11 percent from 
105 percent two weeks later on feb 24 it rose another 05 
percentage points to 115 percent and remained at that level until 
today 
economists said todays decline came in response to market 
interest rate trends 
the banks have finally acknowledged the drop in rates that has 
occurred in recent weeks said ward mccarthy a managing director 
of stone amp mccarthy research associates inc a money market 
research firm based in princeton nj 
the federal reserve pushed interest rates higher early this year 
to keep the economy from overheating but rates have fallen 
recently primarily because the economy has clearly lost a lot of 
steam mccarthy said 
on feb 24 the interest rate on the treasurys 30year bond was 
918 percent while today the yield was quoted at 843 percent 
mccarthy said it was somewhat surprising that the banks decided 
to act although the fed has not yet eased its stand on interest 
rates 
i think its pretty much a foregone conclusion that the fed 
will ease policy he said 
but economists also did not foresee the fed allowing rates to 
plunge 
they have not yet been convinced that the inflation dragon has 
been tamed said donald ratajczk director of economic 
forecasting at georgia state university in atlanta 
the prime rate reflects a banks costs of borrowing money 
including interest it pays on customer accounts shortterm 
certificates of deposit and bonds and as such mirrors rather than 
forecasts rate trends

a 13000gallon oil spill that fouled the 
yampa river in northwestern colorado has been contained said an 
environmental official who criticized the weekend cleanup effort by 
the oil company 
the spill occurred friday when a pipeline carrying light crude 
oil running beneath the river burst amoco pipeline co shut off 
the line after craig police reported the pipe break 
amoco crews tried to contain the spill saturday but werent 
successful until sunday 
they didnt really put up the booms correctly which was a 
factor in causing the oil trap anchor cable to snap said jeff 
knoy a spokesman in denver for the environmental protection 
agency they havent had a lot of experience or they put it up 
incorrectly 
basically amocos not done the best job and weve had to 
jump on them some he said part of the problem was high water 
i dont think theyve had to do this in a while but they didnt do 
a very good job 
but amoco spokesman jack rigg said today the company did 
everything we reasonably could 
he said the pipeline was shut off within 45 minutes of the time 
the leak was reported and said amoco had 40 people and several 
thousand feet of booms at the river within two hours but the 
rivers roughness and remoteness foiled those early cleanup 
efforts he said 
rigg said amoco managed to get the oil contained and diverted 
within 50 miles of the spill by sunday and crews with shovels and 
plastic buckets were cleaning up the 50mile stretch today 
the yampa river is a breeding ground for three endangered 
species of fish humpback and bonytail chubs and colorado squawfish 
the environmental impact was minimal considering what it 
would have been knoy said sunday the fish and wildlife 
service went up and down the river quite a bit the last few days 
as of last night there were no dead fish no fish in distress and 
no dead birds 
the spill was not expected affect drinking water in this town of 
8000 because it occurred downstream of the point where water is 
taken from the river

may by the conference board said they anticipate that business 
conditions will improve in the next six months that was up from 17 
percent a month earlier 
thirty percent of those surveyed said they believe current 
business conditions are good a slight rise from the april 
survey despite an increase in unemployment 345 percent of 
respondents said they believe jobs are plentiful the same as 
in april 
the number of people expecting more jobs to become available 
increased to 19 percent from 154 percent but there was also an 
increase in the number of people who expect the reverse to happen 
to 15 percent from 13 percent 
the fact that consumer confidence has remained strong despite 
signs of a slowing economy is reassuring fabian linden 
executive director of the boards consumer research center said in 
a statement 
consumers who are evidently in the first instance wage 
earners have always been quick to sense oncoming recession he 
said but there are none of the indications in recent survey 
readings that generally signal troubles ahead 
the boards monthly consumer confidence index gained one point 
to 1178 with 1985 as 100 that was down from 1202 a year ago 
the conference board is a nonprofit business network that 
provides information and management and economic research for 
business leaders worldwide

share prices on londons stock exchange ended 
significantly lower monday for the fifth session in a row as the 
market remained unsettled by weakness in sterling and the outlook 
for british interest rates 
trading activity was dull however as many players stuck to the 
sidelines waiting for further evidence of britains economic 
performance 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed 141 
points lower at 20885 just 06 point below its best level 
reached at midafternoon at its lowest the index was down 261 
points in morning business 
volume slowed sharply to 3592 million shares from 6359 million 
shares on friday 
the major factor worrying the london market was the weakness in 
sterling which continued to lose ground despite reported 
intervention by the bank of england to bolster the currency 
players were concerned the pounds weakness could trigger yet 
another rise in interest rates which were pushed up 1 percentage 
point to 14 percent last month 
theres been no real underpinning of sterling from the 14 
percent interest rates said bill smith a market analyst at 
prudential bache securities in london the danger of 15 percent 
is that much higher so the danger of a hard landing for the 
british economy is that much higher

the latest consumer survey report suggests that 
economic expansion will slow unemployment and interest rates might 
rise and inflation will dig in at a rate of at least 5 percent 
this isnt an especially negative forecast because the economy 
is expected to continue expanding but it is a downturn consumers 
remain comfortable according to one interpreter but they expect 
things to get worse 
that information from the university of michigans survey 
research center is being distributed to clients and is destined to 
become part of the commerce departments index of leading economic 
indicators 
as part of that index it then will be used by investors 
economists bankers regulators business people and others who 
seek to get a peak into the future and if possible take some 
action about events to come 
but can consumers forecast 
you bet they can says richard t curtin director of the 
michigan institute they can that is if they are questioned 
professionally and their responses recorded and analyzed 
scientifically 
to demonstrate their accuracy curtin measured expectations with 
what followed in several areas including interest rates jobless 
rates and inflation rates and found a remarkable accuracy rate 
he found for instance that consumers anticipated changes in 
interest rates two quarters or six months in advance of changes 
in the prime interest rate that beats many a professionals record 
for unemployment curtin found their anticipation time span even 
longer at three quarters or nine months in advance regarding 
inflation the foresight was only one quarter in advance but the 
accuracy rating was especially high 
the same general levels of accuracy also pertain to some of the 
more specific money items that are measured changes in consumer 
expectations for example accurately foretell housing and vehicle 
markets six months in advance 
there is little mystery to why consumers en masse can 
forecast to some extent in sales for example they are not 
forecasting so much as foretelling they are that is telling the 
markets what they intend to do 
measured accurately their own economic condition becomes a 
projection of the whole economy of which consumers are the biggest 
segment bigger than business or government 
in each area of the michigan survey consumers are asked to give 
their overall opinions and to describe in their own words reasons 
for holding these views of course their financial condition and 
hopes enter the picture 
according to curtin when many people change from an optimistic 
to a pessimistic view at the same time it has been found that a 
widespread shift toward postponement of expenditures follows 
it is in this manner he says that the economic optimism and 
confidence of individual families exert their influence on the 
course of the aggregate economy 
of particular interest in the latest monthly survey based on 
500 interviews in which about 25 core questions were asked is the 
attitude toward inflation and interest rates 
many professional forecasters in financial and economic circles 
are expecting a decline in interest rates reasoning that the 
latest economic measurements show the inflation threat is ebbing 
consumers however see worsening inflation and higher interest 
rates

the supreme court on monday agreed to decide 
whether florida may block an illinoisbased bank holding company 
from establishing an industrial savings bank in miami 
the justices said they will review the dispute even though bush 
administration lawyers asked for their views said a change in 
federal banking law may have made the case moot 
continental bank corporation based in illinois filed an 
application with the florida department of banking an finance in 
1981 to establish and run an industrial savings bank in miami 
the proposed bank would not accept demand deposits or make 
commercial loans making it a socalled nonbank bank that 
fell outside the federal laws definition of banks 
but deposits in the proposed bank would be insured by the 
federal deposit insurance corporation 
the application was denied and continental subsequently sued in 
federal court the suit alleged that floridas denial of the 
application was unconstitutional 
under federal banking law a bank holding company based in one 
state may not establish a bank in another state unless the latter 
states laws specifically authorize it to do so 
but because nonbank banks fall outside the scope of federal 
banking law state regulation of such institutions is subject to 
the constitutions requirement that states not unduly interfere 
with or discriminate against interstate commerce 
while the continental case was pending before a federal appeals 
court in 1987 federal banking law was amended to include in the 
definition of bank any institution the deposits of which are 
insured by the fdic 
because the proposed industrial savings bank in miami was to be 
fdicinsured it fell within the scope of federal banking law and 
subject to floridas legally authorized discrimination 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals however refused to 
declare the case moot 
it instead ruled that the florida law banning the industrial 
savings bank was unconstitutional the appeals court said it could 
say that the change in federal law would make continentals 
operation of the florida institution banking activity in 
every instance 
gerald a lewis who heads the state department of banking and 
finance then sought supreme court review 
the case is lewis vs continental bank corp 871955

us treasury secretary nicholas brady 
called on international bankers monday to help impove third world 
economies by forgiving some of their outstanding debt 
brady told the international monetary conference whose 
membership includes 99 major commercial banks in 22 countries that 
bankers could enhance their claims if they offered countries the 
types of debt reductions proposed in the socalled brady plan 
the plan stresses cutting debt principal and interest payments 
over continued lending to heavily indebted countries 
i ask you to compare the risks of inaction with the benefits 
of concluding transactions that meet the tests of realism and 
reasonableness brady said 
if banks follow the brady plan bank claims will be somewhat 
lower but they will be better claims and they will be better 
serviced he said 
but brady added that third world debtor nations which owe about 
half their 12 trillion debt to commercial banks would only be 
eligible for the plan if they reformed their troubled economies 
some bankers however were skeptical of the propposal 
its a bit onesided to state that debt reduction by the 
commercial banks is the answer to the problem fop hoogendijk 
managing director of the amsterdamrotterdam bank nv told 
reporters people should pay their interest 
the two main international lending agencies the international 
monetary fund and the world bank have backed the debt reduction 
strategy known as the brady plan as have the major industrialized 
creditor nations 
in other developments at mondays conference bankers and 
industrialists discussed the european economic communitys plan to 
drop internal trade and capital barriers in 1992 
helmut sihler the chief executive officer of the west german 
chemical company henkel kgaa said companies based outside the eec 
will reap early benefits from the plan but he said eecbased 
companies face more obstacles to taking advantage of the single 
market because they are oriented toward their own national markets 
percy barnevik the head of swiss engineering firm abb asea 
brown boveri ltd said twothirds of the eecbased companies would 
be hurt as a result of the market integration proposed in the 
single european act 
barnevik said politicians stressed the positive aspects of 
economic unification but ignored the hardships reduction of 
plants reduction of people inherent to industrial progress 
other imc panelists underlined their belief that eec companies 
faced their principal challenge from everstronger japanese and 
american companies regardless of the creation of the single market 
its not a question of europe 92 the problem is the 
cutthroat outside competition jeanlouis beffa the chief 
executive officer of the french glassmaker saint gobain said 
europe 1992 is not a problem its an answer

grain and soybeans futures prices closed mostly 
higher monday on the chicago board of trade 
pressure came early on two fronts the first being considerable 
rainfall over the weekend in key growing areas of the midwest 
the second reason was that china thought to be in the market 
for as much as a million tons of grain apparently have decided to 
postpone such purchases in the wake of civil unrest 
both the grains and beans however bounced back from early 
session lows as buyers came into the markets to cover short 
positions volume was light in all the pits 
on the close wheat was 3 cents higher to 6 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 395 a bushel corn was 
cent higher to 3 cents higher with july 265 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to cent higher with july at 169 a bushel and 
soybeans were cent lower to 12 cents higher with july at 706 a

analysts said the us market registered no strong overall 
response to the strife in beijing although stocks in hong kong 
took a severe drop 
however several individual stocks of companies with operations 
or investments in china and nearby asian nations ran into selling 
pressure 
windmere corp fell 3 to 15 in active trading the company

hong kong telecommunications dropped 1 to 17 taiwan fund 3

cashing in on the markets recent gains believing it was due for 
at least a pause after its steady advance in recent months 
the domestic business and financial news background was 
generally positive brokers noted several large banks lowered 
their prime lending rates from 115 percent to 11 percent 
and a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives gave 
further support to the belief that the economy was slowing and 
thus presumably giving the federal reserve added incentive to relax 
its credit policy

the supreme court on monday cleared the way 
for drexel burnham lambert inc plead guilty to six felonies and 
pay 650 million in a longdelayed settlement of a landmark 
securities fraud case 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by drexel junk 
bond financier michael milken to have the federal judge presiding 
over the case disqualified on grounds of a conflict of interest 
milken his brother lowell and a former colleague pamela 
monzert sought to have us district judge milton pollack in 
manhattan removed from their case 
pollack must approve a settlement announced in may between the 
new york investment firm and the securities and exchange 
commission the settlement resolves charges including insider 
trading in more than 20 alleged fraud schemes 
approval of that settlement is a precondition for drexel to 
plead guilty to six felony counts and pay a record 650 million in 
fines and restitution in a separate criminal settlement with the 
justice department 
martin flumenbaum an attorney for michael milken declined to 
discuss the supreme court ruling 
the milkens had argued that pollack has an apparent conflict of 
interest because his wife is receiving 30 million from the sale of 
a corporation in which drexel helped set up the financing 
the acquisition of the corporation owned by mrs pollack is 
unrelated to the financial dealings that landed drexel and milken 
in trouble with the government 
pollack refused to disqualify himself from the drexelmilken 
cases and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last year said the 
judge acted properly 
we believea reasonable person would not conclude that the 
judges impartiality could reasonably be questioned the appeals 
court said judge pollacks connection to drexel is too remote 
to mandate recusal because drexel has no obligation direct or 
indirect to mrs pollack 
the challenge to the judges role in the case has held up 
resolution of the secs lawsuit against drexel which was filed 
last september the sec also named milken in the civil suit and 
mondays supreme court ruling clears the way for a civil fraud 
trial of milken 
the 2nd circuit court refused to assign the case to a different 
judge but barred pollack from approving the settlement until the 
supreme court acted on milkens appeal 
once settlement of the secs civil suit against drexel is 
concluded drexel formally will plead guilty to the felonies and 
pay 300 million to the government and 350 million for 
compensation of investors victimized by alleged insider trading 
drexel originally tried to get pollack to disqualify himself 
from the sec suit but later dropped its objections 
the ruling does not affect a separate 98count criminal fraud 
and racketeering indictment against michael and lowell milken that 
contains charges similar to ones filed by the sec a trial in new 
york in that case is scheduled for march 1990

the nations big three automakers said monday 
that late may car and light truck sales fell 56 percent from last 
year ending the twomonth spring buying season that saw a flurry 
of incentives to spark sales 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
they sold vehicles at a daily rate of 47359 during from may 2131 
compared with a daily rate of 50181 in the same 1988 period 
car sales were down 42 percent and truck sales were off 79 
percent 
the 10day period last year was one of the strongest of 1988 
which proved to be the secondbest sales year in automobile history 
through the first five months of this year the car and 
truckselling pace is lagging 53 percent behind the rate last 
year with cars running 74 percent behind last years rate and 
trucks off by 16 percent 
typically april and may are among the hottest selling times in 
the automobile industry as americans prepare for summer vacations 
and weekend road trips 
sales through march of this year ran below expectations 
resulting in largerthananticipated inventories the big three 
offered incentive packages in early april that boosted cash 
rebates lowered finance rates and extended the deal to more models 
the strategy appears to have worked somewhat 
combined april and may car and truck sales by the big three 
automakers ran 07 percent ahead of vehicle sales during those two 
months last year this years daily sales rate was 38944 vehicles 
in april and may compared with a rate of 38654 last year 
but inventories remained swollen and companies have been 
temporarily idling plants to reduce them speculation has continued 
that summer shutdowns during which factories are retooled for next 
years models may be longer than normal 
ford sustained the largest decline in car sales among the big 
three in late may its cars sold at daily rate of 9121 during 
down 84 percent from 9956 last year light trucks made by ford 
sold at a rate 2 percent below last year

nwa incs board of directors rejected all 
offers to buy the company monday and invited suitors to revise 
their bids but the parent of northwest airlines indicated there 
was no assurance it would get an offer it deemed acceptable 
nwa inc has received a number of acquisition proposals in 
response to its request for offers the board said in a 
statement none of the proposals is acceptable in its present 
form further none of the proposals is sufficiently more 
attractive than the others 
the statement said each of the bids is subject to unacceptable 
material conditions but did not elaborate however in letters 
to bidders the company said interested buyers needed to address 
concerns raised by federal regulators and the issue of compensating 
nwa in the event it accepted an offer that later collapsed 
nwa stock tumbled 2 to 10675 a share in late trading on the 
new york stock exchange following the companys announcement 
the company declined to identify bidders who met last weeks 
deadline for submitting offers or to outline the proposals 
known bidders included oil billionaire marvin davis who earlier 
this year made a 27 billion buyout proposal new yorkbased pan 
am corp which has made a proposal valued at 33 billion 
northwests 20000member machinists union and an investment 
group led by former hotel executive alfred checchi which includes 
klm royal dutch airlines and the australian holding company elders 
ixl ltd 
a fivemember committee of the nwa board reviewed offers from at 
least four groups the board said monday that suitors had until 
june 16 to submit revisions so as to enhance the attractiveness 
of their proposals 
a letter to the bidders directed them to be specific about their 
ability to finalize a deal in light of financing concerns and 
scrutiny by the us department of transportation which regulates 
the airline industry 
accepting a proposal that later might fall through would hurt 
nwa and in revising proposals the bidders should consider means of 
compensating nwa for such damage the letter said 
there can be no assurance that a sale of nwa or any other 
transaction will result from nwas review of alternatives the 
letter said 
pan am was the only bidder to disclose details of its financial 
package which could support a bid of 110 a share 
the takeover firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co has been rumored 
as a possible bidder but has declined comment

pilot fatigue and disorientation may have been 
a factor in fatal crashes of two secret stealth fighters in 
california and nevada according to heavily censored air force 
accident reports 
the 1986 and 1987 crashes involved aircraft stationed at nellis 
air force base north of las vegas 
the reports released by nellis indicate the pilots fought 
fatigue brought on by a rigorous flight schedules with many pilots 
working 12 to 14hour shifts 
the secret jets flew only at night until nov 10 when the air 
force acknowledged the existence of the radareluding jets and said 
they would begin daytime operations 
fiftytwo stealth fighters are assigned to the 4450th tactical 
fighter group at nellis with the program operating out of the 
tonopah test range 150 miles northwest of las vegas

environment or certain aircraft features may have contributed to 
the crashes they did not specify the causes of the crashes but 
outlined circumstances surrounding the accidents 
the first crash occurred july 11 1986 about 17 miles northeast 
of bakersfield calif killing the pilot the report indicates 
there was no precrash fire or attempt by the pilot to eject and no 
indication of mechanical failure 
in a memo dated the day before the crash lt col john miller 
a squadron commander wrote i believe that these extended hours 
are taking their toll on overall pilot performance i have detected 
more and more instances of poor judgment that werent evident 
twothree months ago 
the pilots flew a7 aircraft for proficiency during the day 
then flew the stealth flights at night 
the second crash occurred oct 14 1987 about 61 miles east of 
alamo also killing the pilot again there was no indication of a 
precrash fire or of attempts to eject 
there are only three known crashes of the stealth jet a crash 
occurred when lockheed corp the manufacturer was testing the jet 
in washington on monday the air force announced the a7 jets 
assigned to the 4450th tactical group were being transferred to the 
air national guard the service said the 18 a7s would be replaced

toy manufactuer hasbro inc said monday 
it has adopted measures to stave off potentially hostile takeover 
bids after rumors the company might become a target 
the measures do not prohibit sale of the company but 
effectively give shareholders the right to buy hasbro stock at a 
discount in the event of a hostile takeover bid 
the move follows the hospitalization of hasbro chairman stephen 
d hassenfeld 47 for treatment of pneumonia which has stirred 
rumors the company might be sold if he does not return to work 
hasbro which was the second most actively traded company on the 
american stock exchange last week closed monday down 375 cents at 
2125 
the shareholder rights plan is intended to assure that 
shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in connection with 
any effort to gain control of the company without paying all 
shareholders a premium value hasbro president alan g hassenfeld 
said in a statement 
the plan approved by the companys board meet the boards 
desire to provide protection against abusive takeover tactics such 
as partial tender offers and open market purchases he said 
under the plan hasbro shareholders of record june 15 will get 
one preference share for each common share they now hold 
if a person or group buys or annouces a tender offer to buy 20 
percent or more of hasbro common stock preference shares will

publisher robert maxwell suspended publication 
of chinas official englishlanguage newspaper monday in europe 
saying he wouldnt honor the joint venture because of revulsion 
over the massacre in beijing 
chinas economic reforms have greatly improved the prospects 
of prosperity for its people the british newspaper magnate said 
in a statement released in new york but all that progress has 
been disfigured and nullified by the events of last weekend 
maxwell said it will be a standing disgrace to the name of 
china that the guns of the peoples army should have been turned so 
brutally upon the people themselves patience has always been one 
of the greatest chinese virtues patience was called for in 
beijing not bloody murder 
maxwell communication corp plc has been publishing and 
distributing the china daily in europe as part of an agreement with 
the chinese government which began the englishlanguage paper 
several years ago to broaden foreign awareness of the economic 
changes taking place in the country 
it is impossible for friends of china to say and do nothing in 
these circumstances maxwell said for my part i am suspending 
immediately the publication of china daily in europe i hope it 
will not be long before i can resume but that depends on a drastic 
reversal of the course upon which the chinese leadership has 
embarked

economists said major banks reduction of their 
prime interest rates by a halfpoint to 11 percent did not 
necessarily signal a fullscale plunge in interest rates for the 
near future 
experts said mondays cut in the prime was more an attempt by 
the banks to attract business than an indication they expect the 
federal reserve to push market rates sharply lower to forestall an 
economic recession 
the prime is a benchmark used to set interest rates on a variety 
of bank credit ranging from corporate loans to adjustable home 
mortgages

a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction 
monday to keep mcorps bankruptcy case in the courts and out of 
regulators control a decision analysts said will benefit holders 
of more than 400 million of the bank holding companys debt 
us district judge lynn n hughes forbid the federal reserve 
system which regulates bank holding companies from using its 
authority to effect directly or indirectly a reorganization of 
the mcorp group or its components or to interfere except through 
participation in the bankruptcy proceedings with the restructuring 
being developed in the bankruptcy proceeding 
the order sides with mcorp which has been fighting fed efforts 
to make it use an estimated 400 million in assets to prop up its 
weak subsidiary banks 
the fed has maintained that bank holding companies should be a 
source of strength for their member banks if a holding company 
files for bankruptcy protection the fed says the need to provide 
capital for a subsidiary bank should take precedent over the 
obligation to pay off creditors 
mcorp was texas secondlargest bank holding company until 
regulators seized 20 of the 25 mbanks in march combining them 
under one bank which has been operating since as deposit insurance 
bridge bank with 154 billion in assets and 116 billion in 
deposits 
mcorp which retained five banks and a trust operation 
subsequently filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code 
in his order monday hughes said the waste and confusion 
attendant upon parallel bankruptcy and administrative proceedings 
increases costs and conflict and protects no interests that could 
not be addressed solely in the bankruptcy proceeding 
from our reading of the order were pleased mcorp said 
don dorsey a spokesman for the federal reserve bank in dallas 
said he was aware of the ruling but declined to comment 
robert rieke a banking analyst with rauscher pierce refsnes 
inc in dallas said the decision leaves the reorganization plan in 
mcorps hands 
if the fed had been successful on this issue it would have 
pushed some of the questions about mcorp into an administrative 
forum rieke said 
rieke said bondholders should feel gratified that the court 
retains jurisdiction over the reorganization of the company

both congress and the white house are 
expressing outrage at the violence in china but neither is 
suggesting that the millions of tons of us commodities sold to 
that country each year be stopped 
i dont believe in using food as a weapon sen patrick 
leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee said 
monday with all that the chinese people are suffering we should 
not deprive them of food as well 
however the chinese government must not use our food as a 
weapon against its own people i know the world community would 
object to any attempt of the chinese government to restrict the 
flow of food to its people 
the agriculture department announced monday that china has 
bought another 18 metric tons of soft red winter wheat from us 
farmers according to exporters that makes 265 million metric 
tons of the commodity bought for delivery in the marketing year 
that began june 1 
most of it has been purchased in the last two weeks according 
to the agriculture department 
during the marketing year that ended may 31 exporters sold 83 
million metric tons of us grain to china 
china also buys poultry to breed livestock semen hogs and seed 
to plant for animal feed according to the agriculture departments 
foreign agricultural service 
by far the largest commodity is grain said a spokeswoman in 
the department china gets other products from canada australia 
new zealand and europe she said 
since former president carters grain embargo against the soviet 
union for the invasion of afghanistan caused controversy the 
federal government has opposed using agricultural products as 
foreign policy weapons but that doesnt mean it wont refuse to 
extend the export enhancement program to china 
the first 300000 metric tons of wheat purchased this year by 
china were under that discount program but all the rest has been 
bought at market prices 
we must be absolutely clear that chinas brutality against its 
own people is unacceptable said sen richard lugar rind 
ranking republican on the agriculture committee 
at the same time its important that us actions be moderate 
and targeted against the government rather than the people of 
china 
president bush said monday that weapons sales would be suspended 
and other aspects of bilateral relationship would be reviewed 
on the commercial side i dont want to hurt the chinese 
people bush said during a news conference i happen to believe 
that commercial contacts have led in essence to this quest for 
more freedom 
rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee said the united states should be committed 
never to use food embargoes as a weapon because they are 
ineffective and hurt both sides 
food embargoes are never the answer and particularly in this 
case it could worsen the pain and suffering of the chinese 
people he said

the us dollar opened sharply higher against the 
japanese yen tuesday morning while share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange plunged 
the dollar started at 14250 yen a sharp 185yen gain from 
mondays close of 14065 yen 
a trader with the bank of tokyo attributed the dollars higher 
opening in tokyo to its overnight upswing in new york where 
investors bought the currency following a federal reserve bank 
selling operation conducted to increase the amount of money in the 
market by selling bonds without manipulating the discount rate 
investors took the action as indicating the feds would not 
ease the monetary policy by lowering the federal fund rate 
although it was expected and began buying the dollar the trader 
said 
japanese investors followed the trend on wall street and also 
bought the us currency he said 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which shed 
21034 points monday quickly lost 20993 points or 063 percent 
to fall further to 3325515 points within the first 15 minutes of 
morning trading 
dealers said the nikkei declined after a 3716point loss in the 
dow jones industrial average in new york overnight 
the yens decline against the dollar on the foreign exchange and 
the deteriorating studentmilitary dispute in china also 
discouraged trading said a dealer with a major securities firm in

regulators are sifting through thousands of 
financial documents to decide which insurers may be exempt from 
rate rollbacks approved by california voters insurance 
commissioner roxani gillespie said monday 
if the 850 boxes filled with exemption applications from 
insurers doing business in california are any indication it could 
be some time before policyholders see a change in their insurance 
bills 
our intent is to have them all out of here by november 
gillespie said some people will do what we tell them others 
will appeal and go to court it will depend upon the extent 
litigation ensues from our decision 
in may the state supreme court upheld most of proposition 103 
the insurance ratereduction ballot measure approved by voters last 
november setting the stage for the insurance department to decide 
how the law is enforced 
insurers will be allowed to increase rates without prior state 
approval until november however any amount that the insurance 
commissioner rules to be excessive when measured against a 
standard of a fair rate of return will have to be refunded to 
customers with interest 
gillespie predicted few insurers will raise their rates during 
the next six months 
she spoke to reporters at a news conference at the new rate 
rollback office where about 35 financial examiners will look at 
thousands of documents submitted by insurers another 35 examiners 
will work at an office in los angeles 
many companies may have gone overboard in submitting documents 
in order to play it safe turning in dozens of boxes gillespie 
said 
most of the more than 700 insurers doing business in california 
have filed for some kind exemption she said 
while all types of insurance may be subject to rollbacks under 
the new law much of the attention has focused on auto insurance 
under the measure people with clean driving records will be 
entitled to a 20 percent rate discount starting in november
