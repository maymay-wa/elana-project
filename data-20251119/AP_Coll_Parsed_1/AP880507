a regent at the university of oklahoma has 
joined a group of students who are pleading with school officials 
to change the name of a building named after a former leader of the 
ku klux klan 
the time is right for a change the regent sylvia lewis 
said friday we shouldnt be perpetuating discrimination at one 
of our flagship universities 
faculty and student organizations at the university have asked 
the regents to change the name of the chemistry building which was 
dedicated in 1917 as debarr hall after edwin debarr one of the 
first four professors at oklahoma 
debarr established the school of pharmacy in 1894 and later the 
first school of petroleum engineering he was a vice president of 
the university from 1909 to 1923 
debarr was an oklahoma grand dragon of the kkk and in 1924 he 
was a national chaplain of the klan 
in 1922 the universitys regents censured debarr for his 
involvement with the klan and he was dismissed from the university 
in 1923 
the name is inappropriate said roland lehr acting chairman 
of the chemistry department in recent weeks students have staged 
a protest in front of the building 
oklahoma president frank horton declined comment on the issue on

donald t regan often at odds with first lady 
nancy reagan when he was white house chief of staff now apparently 
has alienated president reagan with his forthcoming book 
the book for the record from wall street to washington 
makes assertions about mrs reagans interest in astrology that the 
president appears to view as a personal attack on his wife 
during a photo session at the start of a cabinet meeting friday 
reporters asked reagan whether he felt betrayed or angered by the 
book 
well i will say this that i would have preferred it if hed 
decided to attack me and apparently from what we hear hes chosen 
to attack my wife and i dont look kindly upon that at all the 
president replied 
tom dawson a regan spokesman said regan has had and will 
have no comments regarding his book until it is published he 
said the book is expected to be in stores beginning monday 
but strobe talbott washington bureau chief of time magazine 
which will publish excerpts of the book said friday that regans 
book paints an absolutely devastating picture of the reagan 
administration 
it characterizes the kind of inside scene there to be a little 
bit like the court of the medicis with a little bit of lady 
macbeth and maybe the keystone cops 
talbott in comments on the syndicated discussion show inside 
washington scheduled for broadcast today said the book portrays 
an unidentified san francisco astrologer friend of mrs reagan as 
a kind of absentee presence almost at the cabinet table or at 
least right outside the oval office working first through mrs 
reagan 
an excerpt from talbotts appearance on the show was aired 
friday by wusatv in washington 
the president in the past has reacted sharply to criticism of 
his wife or suggestions that she interferes or has too great a role 
in administration decisionmaking 
regan the presidents former top staff aide and treasury 
secretary had an uneasy relationship with mrs reagan whose 
opposition is widely believed to have been behind his ouster as 
chief of staff early last year 
the president in the past has praised regans contribution to 
his administration and the former wall street executive was one of 
the most enthusiastic and loyal defenders of reagan policies 
during the aftermath of the irancontra scandal in which money 
from arms sales to iran was diverted to the nicaragua contra 
rebels regan and the first lady had telephone arguments over how 
to handle the matter reportedly ending with her hanging up on him 
in his book regan is said to reveal that mrs reagan used 
astrology to determine the timing of the presidents speeches and 
travel 
the president has denied that any of his decisions have been 
influenced by astrology in which the position of the sun moon and 
stars are studied in the belief that they influence human affairs 
the white house says mrs reagan has followed astrology since 
before the reagans came to the white house her interest was 
heightened by the march 30 1981 assassination attempt against her 
husband spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier this week 
fitzwater said that as far as he knows reagans interest in 
astrology is limited to reading his horoscope 
reagan said friday he did not expect regan to send him a copy of 
his book which is being published by harcourt brace jovanovich 
unless im prepared to send a check in return 
the president previously has made disparaging comments about 
socalled kissandtell books by former aides 
last month for example he was asked his opinion of a book by 
former white house spokesman larry speakes in which speakes 
revealed that on two occasions he made up quotes and attributed 
them to the president 
reagan said last month he was not aware of speakes actions at 
the time and added i can tell you right now that i have no 
affection for these kissandtell books that are being written and 
i find it entirely fiction 
asked friday what his bookwriting advice would be for members 
of his cabinet and current aides the president gestured around the 
table and said i trust all these people the room erupted in 
laughter

transportation secretary jim burnley misled 
the public by asserting a study showed the new 65 mph speed limit 
had no discernible effect on the traffic death rate a former 
carter administration official said 
i think that burnley is just trying to make a political case 
for doing what he wants to do and that the statistics in fact 
contradict his position and hes trying to maneuver the 
statistics said joan claybrook who headed the national highway 
traffic safety administration under president carter 
ms claybrook now is president of public citizen a policy group 
often critical of the reagan administration 
it is totally absurd but expected from joan claybrook said 
transportation department spokesman ron defore joan has 
consistently been a critic of nhtsa under this administration and 
this study this interim report does not support her point of 
view 
the department in a report presented to congress on friday 
said raw data showed only a 1 percentage point difference in 
traffic fatality increases on rural interstate highways having the 
higher speed limit and those retaining the 55 mph national speed 
limit adopted in 1974 
were just not finding any distinction burnley said after a 
speech this week to the society of automotive engineers 
the study however analyzed the traffic data in several ways 
and some of the results suggest the higher speed limit results in a 
higher fatality rate said the insurance institute for highway 
safety an insurance industry organization 
institute president brian oneill said the most reliable finding 
in the report used a mathematical model to examine traffic fatality 
data since 1975 
that method concluded that fatalities on rural interstate 
highways increased by 20 percent in the first four or five full 
months following adoption of the higher speed limit compared with 
the fatalities that would otherwise have been expected 
most of the states raised their speed limits on rural highways 
in april and may of last year 
i think there is no question that these numbers are 
confirming unfortunately what all the prior evidence suggested 
was going to happen that the higher speed limits would translate 
into higher speeds oneill said 
using other methods the study found 
during the first nine months of 1987 traffic fatalities on 
highways with the 65 mph limit rose 18 percent from a year earlier 
in 37 states that had adopted the higher speed compared with a 17 
percent increase in 11 states that had not 
from jan 1 1987 to the time of the speed limit change 
fatalities had increased 10 percent from the corresponding period a 
year earlier after the speed limit was raised through sept 30 
1987 fatalities were 23 percent higher than a year earlier the 
study said 
the 23 percent increase in fatalities on rural interstates 
after the speed limit was changed compared with a 13 percent 
decline in fatalities on urban interstates during the same period 
and a 5 percent decline in fatalities on noninterstate roads 
individual states also showed a great variety in 
trafficfatality patterns on rural interstates from june 1987 
through september 1987 the study said 
ten states that increased the speed limit had fewer fatalities 
than in the corresponding period a year earlier they were 
arkansas colorado illinois missouri montana new hampshire 
north dakota texas washington and west virginia georgia which 
did not raise speed limits also showed a decline 
nine states that kept the lower speed limit during the period 
had more fatalities they were connecticut hawaii massachusetts 
michigan new jersey new york pennsylvania rhode island and 
virginia 
oneill said that data could be misinterpreted as meaning speed 
limits contributed to increased deaths in some areas but not in 
others the fact is that fatality figures are small enough in 
each state for wide fluctuations to be expected he said 
on all highways the number of fatalities increased in 1987 but 
the number of miles traveled by vehicles on the nations highways 
was substantially higher than in 1986 burnley said in a speech 
this week

the reagan administration says it is looking 
at ways to help thousands of nicaraguan rebels facing acute food 
shortages during stalled negotiations between the contras and the 
sandinista government 
state department spokesman charles redman said friday the 
alternatives include direct deliveries of food to rebel forces or 
cash payments to be used for food purchases 
any such move would almost certainly touch off a vigorous 
sandinista protest that the terms of the temporary ceasefire 
agreed to by the contras and the government on march 23 was being 
violated 
the nicaraguan government maintains that us humanitarian aid 
can be delivered only after the rebels have been resettled in seven 
designated ceasefire zones and if a verification commission 
confirms the contents 
no contras have been resettled because there has been no 
agreement on ground rules governing activities in the ceasefire 
zones both the administration and the contras have accused the 
sandinistas of resorting to delaying tactics to deny the rebels 
access to food 
although redman provided no specifics the aid whether food or 
cash apparently would be sent into nicaragua by rebel forces 
based in contra camps in honduras near the nicaraguan border 
the aid program is being managed by the us agency for 
international development which began deliveries to honduranbased 
contras two weeks ago 
aid has denied charges by nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
that the deliveries contained weapons and are illegal because there 
was no prior inspection by an officially designated verification 
commission 
the 48 million aid package approved by congress five weeks 
ago includes 10 million for the commission which includes 
nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y bravo and organization of 
american states secretary general joao baena soares 
redman said the administration has reached tentative agreement 
on funds for the commission but no plan has been received from the 
oas that meets minimum accountability standards

the united states has told the afghan 
guerrillas they must control territory and create an effective 
administrative structure if they want to establish an 
internationally recognized provisional government 
in the first public airing of its views on a provisional regime 
to rival the sovietbacked government in kabul the state 
department said friday the afghan resistance must meet certain 
criteria before receiving us recognition as a government 
the possibility of such a provisional government has been 
heightened since a soviet agreement last month to withdraw its 
estimated 115000 troops from afghanistan within nine months the 
agreement envisions the return of millions of afghan refugees and 
the establishment of an independent government 
a provisional regime presumably would give the afghan resistance 
forces a head start in their drive to replace the weakened marxist 
government in kabul once the soviet forces leave the country 
us officials have predicted the kabul government headed by 
afghan leader najibullah will collapse once the soviets withdraw 
state department spokesman charles e redman said the first 
essential step is for the soviets to pull their forces out 
which will create an evironment more conducive to a genuine 
process of selfdetermination and establish a more broadly based 
government 
zalmay khalilzad an adviser to undersecretary of state michael 
armacost met with resistance leaders recently and reportedly 
outlined the criteria under which a provisional government would be 
acceptable to the united states 
the resistance is well aware of our views redman said 
there are a number of important criteria for any government to 
have international acceptability 
the test is whether a government controls territory has an 
effective government structure possesses the capacity to exercise 
the valid international obligations and enjoys broad support he 
said 
redman cautioned that it would be premature to disclose 
when or under exactly what conditions we would be prepared to 
establish relations with any government in afghanistan he would 
not for example define how much territory a government must 
control or how strongly its grip must be 
the united states is not involved in any efforts to form a 
provisional government with the resistance or anyone else 
the spokesman belittled the significance of reports by indian 
officials that najibullah expressed an interest during talks in new 
delhi in sharing power with the guerrilla groups 
its clear that pdpa najibullahs party lacks popular 
support among the afghan people redman said hes made these 
professions of interest in powersharing before and his 
formulations have always lacked credibility and still do theyve 
never addressed the issue of genuine powersharing but rather 
amount to pdpa domination of the government

a strong earthquake rocked northern japan on 
saturday morning the central meteorological agency said national 
police said there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties 
the agency said the quake centered off the coast of the 
northernmost island of hokkaido occurred at 1059 am 959 pm 
friday edt and measured a preliminary reading of 64 on the 
richter scale 
cma officials said the quake registered a four on the japanese 
scale of seven in kushiro 560 miles northwest of tokyo three in 
aomori 360 miles away and one in tokyo 
a tremor measuring five on the japanese scale can crack walls 
overturn gravestones and damage chimneys a four will shake houses 
and topple vases 
the openended richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake 
at its epicenter according to ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs 
an earthquake of five on the scale is considered very strong 
and a six severe capable of widespread damage near the 
epicenter 
every increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase in 
magnitude thus a reading of 75 would be 10 times stronger than 
one of 65 
the japanese scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a 
particular location and is not convertible to the richter scale

an arabamerican lobbying group is praising a 
california companys decision to stop selling tear gas to israel 
saying the move is a symbolic victory for palestinians 
we hope the decision will send a signal to israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir that he can no longer count on corporate 
americas cooperation in denying the palestinians their most basic 
human rights the americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
said in a statement friday 
the statement came after an official of transtechnology corp 
of sherman oaks calif said the board of directors had agreed to 
the companys new policy under which the firm will no longer sell 
tear gas to israel 
we want some breathing room said burl alison 
transtechnologys vice president describing the companys decision 
the company which makes tear gas at its federal laboratories in 
saltsburg pa had been under tremendous pressure from 
arabamerican groups and human rights activists to stop the sales 
she said 
the groups claimed the israelis have misused the tear gas in 
quelling palestinian demonstrations in the west bank and gaza 
strip causing deaths and injuries 
yossi gal a spokesman at the israeli embassy disputed 
allegations that his government deliberately has misused tear gas 
and pointed out that tear gas is routinely used by police and 
military forces around the world 
he described as wildly exaggerated the allegations that as many 
as 40 people in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip had 
been killed by improper use of tear gas 
mrs alison did not rule out the possibility that tear gas sales 
would resume but she said that would happen only if the company 
can determine the chemical crowdcontrol agent is being handled 
properly 
there are no outstanding contracts to ship tear gas to israel 
but mrs alison said the israelis wanted to buy more gas from 
transtechnology 
israel has bought 120000 tear gas grenades or projectiles from 
us companies under the us governments military sales program 
since december 
state department officials have defended the sale of tear gas to 
israel on the grounds that it is an effective way of curbing 
violent demonstrations alternative methods of controlling crowds 
could be much more lethal they say 
physicians for human rights a bostonbased group has expressed 
concern that the israelis may not be following proper handling 
directions for tear gas which overcomes victims by causing severe 
irritation to the eyes skin and respiratory tract the group has 
called for more study into the effects of tear gas 
if used correctly the effects of tear gas are shortlived but 
the chemical agent can cause death particularly to infants and the 
elderly if it is fired into enclosed spaces there have been 
reports the israelis fired tear gas into a mosque and a hospital

the reagan administration is expressing 
skepticism about frances claim that no reward was given to iran 
for its help in the freeing of three french hostages from lebanon 
state department spokesman charles redman said that providing 
rewards to hostage takers could prolong the ordeal of the remaining 
18 hostages in lebanon nine of those hostages are americans 
redman also called on iran on friday to use its influence 
newly demonstrated this week over kidnappers in lebanon to help 
secure the release of the 18 captives 
both the french and iranian governments acknowledged the iranian 
role in the releases of the three french hostages jeanpaul 
kauffmann marcel carton and marcel fontaine 
once again this demonstrates the substantial influence iran 
holds over terrorist kidnappers redman said adding that it is 
not yet clear what prompted iran to take the action it did 
in any case he said we again call on iran to exercise its 
proven influence immediately to secure the release of the other 
hostages still held in lebanon 
france has denied that any money was paid for the hostages 
freedom but prime minister jacques chirac has made vague 
references to a bargain with iran 
expressing doubts about the propriety of french actions redman 
said weve noted the french statements on the subject we will 
closely monitor future developments and we will be especially 
sensitive to any actions which could be seen as rewarding the 
taking of hostages 
redman reaffirmed the longstanding us view that the taking of 
hostages should not be rewarded 
such behavior serves only to encourage more terrorism and 
prolong the ordeal of other hostages including the nine innocent 
americans 
redman also disputed the contention of peggy say sister of us 
hostage terry anderson who said it almost appears that france 
placed a higher priority on the lives of the french hostages than 
the american government does on the lives of us hostages 
i would reject the notion that our government is less 
concerned than any other government redman said 
anderson 40 is the chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press he was abducted on march 16 1985 and has been 
held longer than any other hostage in lebanon

a little more than 3 percent of the 105000 
employees of the agriculture department nationwide will be checked 
in the governments opening round of random drug testing among 
federal workers 
but gerald oakley of the departments office of finance and 
management said the 3354 employees working at designated 
positions in usda will represent only the absolute minimum to be 
tested initially 
under rules cleared by the department of health and human 
services the usda program includes provisions that will allow 
supervisors to request testing of workers under reasonable 
suspicion of using drugs also employees may voluntarily undergo 
testing 
the drugs listed by usda in its testing program include 
marijuana cocaine pcp opiates and amphetamines officials 
estimated the cost of the testing program at 16 million the first 
year 
oakley and others said in interviews this week following the 
unveiling of random drug testing plans by dozens of federal 
agencies that no serious objections have been raised so far by 
usda employee unions 
generally the positions to be tested are highlevel 
employees or people with topsecret clearances or people who have 
special exposure at the us borders or in security work he 
said these people will be tested 
oakley added there might be others who might be tested too 
we have no way of knowing but i would think it would not be a very 
large number 
would a lone forest service employee in a fire tower be a 
candidate for drug testing or a chicken inspector working in a 
plant 
probably not but its possible depending on whether the 
forest service or appropriate agency selected the position as one 
designated for testing oakley said there was no intent to 
pick a particular agency and focus on them 
highlevel political appointees will not be exempt not even 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng and his aides if it is 
determined those jobs should be checked out 
drug testing in some federal agencies will involve a much larger 
percentage of their employees at the defense department for 
example as many as 20 percent may be tested eventually 
the initial usda testing of around 3 percent of its employees is 
relatively low because the department has so few highly sensitive 
jobs at least not in the same league with the pentagon state or 
the white house 
but oakley said usda deals with certain economic security 
factors such as massive crop reports that could have an impact on 
the nations economy if leaked prematurely details of new farm 
programs are other examples

659 million tons of cane sugar up 1 percent from 198788 and 
382 million tons from sugar beets down 1 percent 
tonnage was expressed in raw sugar equivalents a metric ton is 
about 2205 pounds 
according to the departments foreign agricultural service 
which released the forecast production in the european economic 
community which accounts for 13 percent of the global output may 
decline 2 percent in 198889 to about 138 million tons because of 
a return to more normal yields and a 1 percent decline in area to 
be harvested 
sugar production in the soviet union the largest producer was 
forecast at 97 million tons down 1 percent from last years 
revised output of 98 million tons

the environmental protection agency has given 
a qualified endorsement to a planned sale of offshore oil and gas 
leases in the north atlantic despite a top agency officials belief 
that the 1989 sale should be scuttled 
michael r deland the epas regional administrator for new 
england said in a memo released friday by a leasing opponent that 
the plan is environmentally unacceptable and that epa should 
urge the interior department to cancel or defer it 
but epa superiors in washington overruled deland and sent the 
interior department a qualified endorsement of the planned february 
sale for exploration only of 55 million acres off the 
northeast coast from maine to new jersey 
deland wrote in the may 3 memo we find that the proposed 
lease sale 96 is environmentally unacceptable because it places at 
unnecessary risk a proven renewable fishery resource of national 
and global biological and commercial value 
deland echoed many of the same arguments stressed by 
environmentalists and local new england officials who oppose 
drilling on georges bank a major fishing area off the new england 
coast 
he said the risks of a major oil spill or blowout from 
exploration and production activities are much greater than 
interior department officials have stated 
the regional chief also noted the importance of georges banks 
180 millionayear fishing industry that accounts for about 
onefifth of the dollar value of all fish caught in the united 
states 
congress has placed a leasing ban on the most fragile areas of 
georges bank but deland warned that many highly sensitive areas 
remain available for lease and thus exposed to the risks associated 
with offshore oil and gas exploration and production 
deland also quoted government estimates which say there is an 86 
percent chance that no oil or gas would be found a figure repeated 
by environmentalists and illustrated by the limited industry 
interest in the area in past years 
rep gerry e studds dmass author of the congressional 
moratorium released the memo friday he said he hopes to use 
delands comments to convince congress to expand the current 
leasing ban to all of georges bank a move he proposed for the 
first time last week 
richard e sanderson director of epas office of federal 
activities who sent the agencys final recommendation to interior 
officials this week said the current lease plan poses almost no 
environmental risk and he pointed to new englands growing 
energy needs 
i just couldnt find a rationale to agree with him deland 
based on the mathematical evaluations sanderson said in a 
telephone interview the best technical data said there was 
minimal to zero risk for exploration 
sanderson added that the revised sale proposal is limited to 
leases for exploration only more risky fullscale production 
which the agency has concerns about would require another level of 
bureaucratic approval he said 
studds a leading opponent of georges bank drilling said the 
most knowledgeable senior official has been overruled by the 
ideologues

workers wearing protective clothing and 
carrying oxygen tanks found three bodies in the hot twisted ruins 
of a refinery friday night raising the death toll from the 
explosion to six one person was missing 
the area is very much in disarray said plant manager fred 
foster there are large pieces of equipment off of foundations 
and down around the cat cracker were inching along as time goes 
on its going to slow down 
the catalytic cracking unit used to break crude oil down into 
usable products such as gasoline was at the center of the blast 
early thursday at the shell oil co refinery fortytwo people were 
injured 
the three bodies found friday night were so badly burned they 
could not immediately be identified officials said two bodies 
were found earlier friday and one was recovered shortly after the 
blast 
foster said the air is still heavy with fumes and small fires 
continued to burn fed by oil and gas residue in the tangle of 
pipes and equipment 
dean perniciaro president of the oil workers union local at the 
plant said friday that he got a look at the blast area and could 
barely recognize the site 
there was an impact to virtually every building in the 
facility the area around the cat cracker is really tore up the 
fire continues around the cat cracker itself he said 
some of the equipment is still recognizable but an awful lot 
of it has just collapsed into charred remains 
shell spokesman bill gibson said friday the plant manager 
visited the families of the missing last night afterward he 
said there wasnt much hope but were still hopeful of course 
the occupational safety and health administration and the 
environmental protection agency sent investigators to the plant 
friday to help in the search for the cause of the explosion 
chemical engineers said they could find no record of an 
explosion by a catalytic cracker there is no historical trend 
for this event said norman marsolan professor of chemical 
engineering at louisiana tech university 
houston huckabay chairman of techs chemical engineering 
department said he checked a list of 100 refinery fires dating 
back to 1955 and found none of them involved a catalytic cracker 
the 25yearold 16story catalytic cracking unit produced 
336000 gallons of gasoline a day 
catalytic crackers were developed to support the nations need 
for high octane fuel after world war ii 
after gasoline is distilled from crude oil the cracker provides 
a second chance to get usable products from the remainder a 
chemical is mixed with the petroleum under heat to produce butane 
propane more gasoline heating oil and diesel fuel 
shell officials refused to speculate on how long the plant might 
be idle although shells adjacent chemical plant was expected to 
resume operations quickly nor would they estimate the cost of the 
damage 
it could take as little as 18 months or as long as 27 months to 
build a new one at a cost as high as 100 million said joseph 
vasilj chief estimator at a long beach calif company which 
builds catalytic crackers 
the bodies of joey poierrer 28 of reserve and ernie carrillo 
44 of kenner were found friday in the control room for the 
gasolineprocessing unit the body of 20year shell employee lloyd 
gregoire 39 of paulina was found shortly after the explosion

shes a grande dame who came from new 
york to witness the last days of the historic comstock lode gold 
rush that helped build the west 
the crowned lady justice arrived in 1877 barefoot robed 
scales in hand and serene eyes unobscured by the traditional 
blindfold to oversee a new 117000 courthouse where miners came 
to answer charges of trespassing claim jumping thieving and 
murder 
now for the first time in 111 years the 7foot symbol of 
justice has left her secondfloor perch overlooking virginia city 
the historic mining town that attracts thousands of tourists each 
year 
shes getting a face and body lift to restore the goldenbronze 
color and luster lost after her nevada arrival which coincided 
with the last rich and glorious days of the comstock lode 
were not going to put a blindfold on her though thats the 
best thing about her said sculptor greg melton who is doing the 
restoration i think im even starting to fall in love with her 
ill have a hard time giving her back to virginia city 
but lady justice wasnt always the object of affection says ron 
james a state historian 
underneath she was made of zinc which is just about the 
ugliest of metals james said recently then she got to looking 
really bad in the 1940s 
they painted her with silver skin and a rustcolored robe 
soon it was flaking off and she looked like a leper one of her 
scales even fell off it was a shame because she really is 
beautiful 
the statue is scheduled to be rededicated on may 15 taking her 
place once again above the town that mark twain helped make famous 
with his blend of fact and fiction as a reporter for the 
territorial enterprise in the early 1860s 
melton whose bronze statue of comstock mining and engineering 
pioneer adolph sutro stands beside the state capitol in carson 
city will paint the lady justice an almost golden bronze color 
just as she was originally 
she had a lot of cracks and shed been beat up because of 
weather conditions the 41yearold sculptor said shes in 
pretty bad shape but not bad enough that i cant fix her 
i give the restoration a 100year guarantee if after 100 
years it collapses ill come back and fix it i guarantee all my 
work 
the virginia city justice is one of only about 20 statues in the 
us without a blindfold according to james who is deputy state 
historic preservation officer 
she was ordered from a catalog for 203 and she could be 
picked with or without the blindfold it was just a matter of 
taste james said i guess the people in virginia city thought 
justice might be intrinsically better if she could see both sides 
it seems to make sense 
the lady justice was brought to virginia city as part of an 
ambitious rebuilding project after threequarters of the town 25 
miles southeast of reno was destroyed in the great fire of 1875 
the city fathers were faced with the question of what to do 
with the community after the fire james said they chose to 
rebuild it in grand style 
the state comstock historic district commission which james 
oversees is paying 2800 for the restoration the hollow statue 
will be filled with letters to the future as a sort of time 
capsule 
james said people will be charged 25 to have a singlepage 
letter placed inside the lady justice the money will go toward the 
restoration of another historic project the 111yearold fourth 
ward school in virginia city 
i hope shell turn out just like when she was first put up 
james said shell look at the sunrise each day and shine like 
she used to she deserves it

john polfreyman expected to die in 1980 when 
he tucked the muzzle of a rifle under his chin and pulled the 
trigger but the bullet he hoped would obliterate his life instead 
gave it new meaning 
lifes now a challenge for me i find happiness in a 
challenge said polfreyman who was blinded and disfigured by the 
suicide attempt 
the bullet severed his optic nerve tore his lips and facial 
cartilage ripped his cheeks away and destroyed his sinuses and 
palate that it did not hit his brain before exiting between his 
eyes he attributes to a higher power 
today polfreyman 25 is working on a history teaching degree 
at weber state college here where his lanky figure is a familiar 
sight as he strides across campus with handy his seeingeye dog 
and kris porter his girlfriend polfreyman hopes to work with 
handicapped students after he graduates 
im in a world that to me is so much nicer he said i see 
people for who they are not for what they have on i see their 
heart a person is so much nicer when seen from the heart 
the world polfreyman saw while growing up was not so nice his 
parents separated when he was in 10th grade and living with his 
father didnt work out 
handsome artistic and aboveaverage in intelligence he was 
bored rambunctious and rebellious if i was told by an authority 
figure to do something id do the opposite he said 
jean elmer polfreymans mother has remarried and lives in 
knightstown ind she remembers that when she complained about her 
sons grades he vowed to make the honor roll he did but the 
challenge was gone and he lapsed back to cs and ds and he drank 
i dont remember a lot of high school from being drunk he 
said 
polfreyman the eldest of four boys said his family was unaware 
of his inner turmoil 
polfreyman lived in denver for a time and in a foster home back 
in utah during his senior year in high school he fought often 
hurting three students pretty bad and eventually dropped out 
he said 
one morning i woke up and decided i had lost complete control 
of my life and there was no way i could go back he said i 
didnt have a challenge in life or a goal that was not achievable 
it was too easy 
deciding suicide was his only option he left home to spend his 
last week with friends in denver a note left for his mother said 
simply mom ive got something important to do i love you 
when he ran out of money he drove to a field outside the city 
he wrote another note 
im sorry for what im about to do he wrote but i 
didnt die sad i was quite happy 
a former vietnam war medic just happened to be in the same field 
trying out a new jeep he administered first aid and used his cb 
radio to call for help 
polfreyman survived his first conscious thought was that he was 
blind it was a peaceful feeling he said 
after i got out of the hospital i tried to find god to thank 
him said polfreyman who first became active in the mormon 
church of his youth and later became a seventhday adventist i 
am very much into what i call a higher power 
adjusting to life without sight was difficult but emotional 
adjustments took even longer 
the boy i used to call johnny died mrs elmer said the 
boy who lives now i call jt theyre nothing alike jt is more 
independent and selfmotivated johnny was more loving he needed 
love and gave more 
polfreyman endured some 20 operations to restore his face 
several of which failed bone from his ankle was used to rebuild 
his nose but a fourinch depression in the left side of his 
forehead remains and now is covered by curly brown hair infection 
forced doctors to remove a plate they had implanted over the spot 
his cheeks however defied doctors expectations and grew back 
mother and son attribute divine intervention to his survival and 
the little miracles that have shaped his recovery 
he has so much to give now that he didnt before said mrs 
elmer only because he didnt know he had it

here are some comments friday from the 
presidential campaign trail 
 
george bush on whether attorney general edwin meese is a 
campaign liability i know him well favorably but i must say i 
am troubled by some of the allegations i think fair play dictates 
that the system go forward and make the determination 
 
bush speaking at a republican dinner in nebraska about 
democrats jesse jackson and michael dukakis its a pleasure to 
be here and ill be back and im not going to be outhustled by 
the hustler from chicago or from that traditional liberal democrat 
from massachusetts 
 
marlin fitzwater white house spokesman saying it was 
courageous for bush to refrain from making recommendations to 
president reagan during cabinet meetingshe has for the first 
time in history defined the vice presidency in a way that is 
meaningful to the president and has made it the confidential 
adviser that i think is very important and i suspect future vice 
presidents will want to follow that mold 
 
bill clinton governor of arkansas coalescing with five 
governors of mostly western states in endorsing michael dukakis for 
the democratic presidential nomination gov dukakis has emerged 
as the voters choice the clear leader in the democratic 
nomination process it is time for the party leadership to unite 
behind his candidacy 
 
jesse jackson on frontrunner dukakis and other obstacles that 
he says stand between himself and the democratic nominationthe 
press the pundits the party the candidate its not just me and

as the death toll from three industrial disasters rose to nine 
friday company and union leaders and government officials debated 
the safety of the refinery skyscraper and chemical plant damaged 
or destroyed by flames or explosions 
an explosion with earthquake force wednesday flattened the 
pacific engineering production co a maker of ammonium perchlorate 
for rocket fuel and a neighboring marshmallow plant in henderson 
nev killing two people and injuring more than 300 people 
that night fire broke out at the 62story first interstate bank 
building in downtown los angeles and quickly enveloped four floors 
of the states tallest skyscraper one worker died when he was 
trapped in an elevator and 40 people were injured authorities 
said 
early thursday explosions set off fires at a shell oil co 
refinery in norco la six people were found dead and one was 
still missing friday according to shell fortytwo people were 
injured as windows shattered and doors and roofs were torn off 
throughout norco 
the accidents triggered talk about fire prevention and 
firefighting in highrise towers handling volatile chemicals and 
how to protect neighbors of potentially hazardous operations 
the united steelworkers of america entered the debate in nevada 
releasing a 1982 letter from a union safety and health technician 
who called pacific engineering plant one of the worst i have ever 
been into usw local 4856 represents workers at the plant 
on friday usw president lynn williams issued a statement 
denouncing the company and the federal occupational safety and 
health administration for not acting on the unions complaints 
but the companys chairman fred gibson maintained it had a 
good record and state officials generally supported him 
jim barnes state industrial relations director said pacific 
engineering underwent 11 inspections by the state occupational 
safety and health division over five years the inspections 
resulted in 10 citations and four fines for incidents he termed 
serious 
there have been problems from time to time mostly minor he 
said our opinion is that overall their record has been a good 
moderate record 
the disaster raised worries about a kerrmcgee corp plant a 
mile away which is the only other facility in the united states to 
manufacture ammonium perchlorate the plant shut down voluntarily 
after the blast until more is known about what caused it 
we will not resume until were absolutely certain its safe 
kerrmcgee spokesman paul reed said friday but weve been 
operating 35 years without any sort of accident we think our plant 
safety record is exemplary 
on friday kerrmcgee executives met with city officials amid 
calls from frightened residents to shut the facility down 
permanently 
weve created a monster of fear said henderson city 
councilman michael harris i dont think anybody other than maybe 
some of those that really knew the plants knew the potential hazard 
inside 
but he said its too early to say were going to run 
kerrmcgee out of town we have to wait and find out what caused 
this it may create a tremendous war out here 
in los angeles there was talk of extending the citys 
requirement that highrises built after 1974 have sprinkler systems 
to older buildings like the 1973 first interstate tower as well 
as many as twothirds of the citys 765 skyscrapers lack 
sprinklers according to fire officials and city councilman nate 
holden said he will propose a law requiring the systems in all 
highrises buildings taller than 75 feet or six or seven stories 
managers of most of the 521 highrises built before 1974 havent 
opted for expensive retrofitting with sprinklers and other 
safety gear said assistant fire chief david parsons first 
interstate was installing a 35 million sprinkler system but it 
wasnt quite completed 
fire officials friday called in investigators of the federal 
bureau alcohol tobacco and firearms to assist in determining the 
cause of the blaze estimated to have done 450 million damage 
their help was requested because of the severity and scale of the 
blaze said assistant fire chief peter lucarelli not necessarily 
because arson is suspected 
bob campbell a spokesman for first interstate bancorp 
discounted arson speculation prompted by news that 100 workers on 
the floor where the fire reportedly broke out might lose their jobs 
because their division was just sold 
in louisiana osha sent investigators to the damaged shell 
refinery friday to help determine the cause of the explosion at the 
catalytic cracker which chemical engineers called highly unusual 
houston huckabay chairman of techs chemical engineering 
department said he checked a list of 100 refinery fires dating 
back to 1955 and found none of them involved a catalytic cracker 
used to break down crude oil into usable products such as gasoline 
and there had never been a fatal accident at the sprawling shell 
refinery which had prided itself on its safety record 
until the accident yesterday the plant had gone 55 million 
work hours without a losttime accident said fred foster plant 
manager 
a fire in april 1985 caused some injuries and shut the plant 
down until it was extinguished but nobody was evacuated from 
norco and the plant was back in business quickly he said 
dean perniciaro president of local 4750 oil chemical and 
atomic workers union said friday that the safety record made 
thursdays explosion hard to believe 
i guess it shows were just not immune to disasters he said

mayor richard s caliguiri the citys chief 
executive for more than a decade died of heart failure at age 56 
on the day he was scheduled to meet with doctors to discuss a 
possible heart transplant 
he was the kindest of men and always thought the best of 
others said city council president sophie masloff 70 who was 
sworn in as mayor friday about seven hours after caliguiris death 
mrs masloff a democrat becomes the citys first woman mayor 
she will complete caliguiris term which expires in january 1990 
and retain her council seat she said she would carry out 
caliguiris policies 
meanwhile friends associates and even former political foes of 
the late mayor praised him friday 
gov robert casey ordered flags on state property flown at 
halfstaff friday and called the late mayor a vibrant force for 
the good of our people our state and our nation 
his death is a tragic loss not only to the family he loved so 
deeply but to the city that has been his lifes work said us 
sen john heinz rpa 
lynn williams president of the united steelworkers which is 
based in pittsburgh described caliguiri as a man of vision and 
compassion who was committed to efforts to revitalize the many 
communities in this region that have been buffeted by economic 
turmoil 
one of caliguiris frequent adversaries councilwoman michelle 
madoff said she remained a friend of the mayor despite their 
disagreements and added he didnt have a mean bone in his body 
the mayors wife jeanne called for an ambulance just after 
midnight friday when she noticed her husband was pale and she could 
not awaken him said dr james otoole caliguiris cardiologist 
paramedics worked for 1 hours to resuscitate him but the mayor 
never regained consciousness and was declared dead at shadyside 
hospital at 136 am officials said 
caliguiri a popular democrat suffered from amyloidosis a rare 
disorder that deposits protein in the heart kidneys and other 
major organs the deposits stiffened his heart doctors inserted a 
pacemaker to stabilize an irregular heart beat in december and were 
considering a transplant 
a meeting had been planned friday to discuss the timing of a 
possible transplant said dr joel weinberg one of the mayors 
physicians

helping shift pittsburgh from its dependence on the steel industry 
to a progressive technically oriented city of 365000 people the

business leaders bought the team in 1985 ensuring it would remain 
for at least five years

on the eve of sundays presidential runoff 
socialist leaders claimed politics had a role in the freeing this 
week of frenchmen held captive in lebanon and new caledonia still 
the releases brought joy 
campaigning is prohibited today 
socialist president francois mitterrand and conservative premier 
jacques chirac staged final rallies friday in the south 
chirac basked in the release in beirut wednesday after three 
years in captivity of marcel fontaine 45 marcel carton 62 and 
jeanpaul kauffmann 44 and in the freeing thursday of 23 french 
lawmen held by melanesian separatists in new caledonia 
the release from exile friday of a french spy convicted in the 
1985 sinking of the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior was another 
dose of good news for chirac supporters 
it wasnt clear how the hostage releases would affect chiracs 
chances in the runoff because polls are forbidden in the final 
week of the campaign most political analysts felt any benefits 
would be insufficient to overcome the wide lead held by mitterrand 
in the final opinion surveys last week 
mitterrand seeking a second sevenyear term said he welcomed 
the hostage releases and made no insinuations about his opponent 
but lionel jospin first secretary of the socialist party 
claimed friday that chirac and his team is working public opinion 
with force in a formidable attempt to manipulate the end of the 
campaign 
chirac rejected allegations that his actions were motivated by 
the elections he said it was my duty to do everything possible 
even if it could lead to critical comments to get the last 
french hostages out of lebanon 
jacques toubon secretarygeneral of chiracs rally for the 
republic party denounced what he called the wet blankets the 
grumblers who split hairs when they should simply be happy 
the last polls indicated mitterrand was favored by 53 percent to 
57 percent of voters compared to chiracs 43 percent to 47 percent 
rating 
the men advanced to the runoff by being the top two votegetters 
in the first round of voting april 24 in that vote mitterrand won 
341 percent of the vote and chirac received 199 percent 
mitterrand named chirac premier in 1986 after the conservatives 
and an allied party won a slim majority in the national assembly 
in paris central place de la concorde 40000 chirac backers 
gathered friday for a final outpouring of support 
france needs a president who decides interior minister 
charles pasqua told the crowd when it was necessary to decide 
for the liberation of hostages in lebanon chirac knew how to 
decide when it was necessary to decide to free the hostages in new 
caledonia chirac knew how to decide 
on thursday morning french security forces stormed a cave in 
the french island territory of new caledonia freeing 23 hostages 
two assault team members and 19 melanesian separatist kidnappers 
were killed 
on friday the government announced that capt dominique prieur 
one of two french agents convicted in new zealand of the 1985 
bombing of an antinuclear greenpeace ship had been allowed to 
leave her island exile for france 
chirac said she was freed because she is pregnant 
ms prieur and the other agent who has already returned to 
france were convicted of manslaughter in the bombing which killed 
a photographer aboard the rainbow warrior 
tenyear new zealand prison terms for the two were suspended 
under a unsponsored agreement provided the two remained in exile 
on a french pacific atoll 
new zealand complained that the return to france violated 
international law 
the leftleaning newspaper le monde said it was difficult to 
believe that mrs prieurs condition required that she be brought 
back to france just 48 hours before the election

sen alfonse damato says his intercession with 
the pentagon on behalf of wedtech corp had nothing to do with rep 
mario biaggi although the congressman had asked him to lobby for 
the company 
damato called as a prosecution witness at the federal 
racketeering trial of biaggi and six others friday conceded that 
he or his staff wrote and called army and small business 
administration officials on behalf of wedtech a nowbankrupt 
defense contractor in the south bronx 
damato who has not been accused of any wrongdoing also said 
biaggi dny had contacted him as many as eight times on 
wedtechs behalf 
but under questioning by biaggis defense lawyer the new york 
republican said he felt wedtech was being treated unfairly and at 
the time thought he was helping a local business in an 
economically deprived area 
and you would have done that if you never met mario biaggi 
asked the lawyer james larossa 
that is correct said damato 
prosecutors charge that biaggi a bronx democrat extorted cash 
and stock from wedtech in return for his influence on capitol hill 
the government contends that biaggi working through his former law 
partner bernard ehrlich enlisted damato and the late rep joseph 
addabbo a powerful queens democrat to help wedtech obtain nobid 
defense contracts 
asked if he would have helped wedtech if he knew biaggi held 
stock in the company damato replied i dont know i think it 
wouldve given me pause to reflect i just dont know 
damato said he appointed ehrlich formerly a general in the new 
york national guard as his unpaid military consultant and hired 
ehrlichs daughter as a press aide 
damato also testified that he arranged a white house meeting 
through a top aide of thenpresidential counselor edwin meese among 
army sba and wedtech officials to help wedtech obtain a 
multimillion dollar small engine contract the army had been 
opposed to giving wedtech the contract 
asked by assistant us attorney edward jm little if wedtech 
got the army contract after that meeting damato replied 
essentially yes 
on cross examination by larossa damato said that his office 
prided itself on helping constituent companies cut through red 
tape he also said he assisted wedtech because he believed the 
company was not being treated fairly by the army 
later damato said under questioning by little that the only 
other time biaggi had sought his assistance on behalf of a military 
contractor was for a brooklyn ship repair company coastal dry dock 
and repair corp 
biaggis involvement with coastal dry dock led to his conviction 
last year for taking an unlawful gratuity biaggi who was 
sentenced to 30 months is free pending appeal 
prosecutors contend biaggi ehrlich and some of the other 
defendants helped wedtech illegally obtain sba approval to 
participate in a program that set aside nobid government contracts 
for minoritycontrolled businesses 
there are no allegations of wrongdoing by addabbo

a british air force helicopter 
taxiing at an air show hit a loading ramp and burst into flames 
killing two people and seriously injuring at least seven officials 
said 
air show visitors ran for cover friday after the rear rotor of a 
usmade chinook helicopter crashed into the ramp about 15 feet 
above the ground 
it was like a bad dream like a bomb went off said a woman 
who identified herself as caren niewisch 27 of los angeles 
panic broke out people fell and tried to get away 
the crash set off several explosions aboard the helicopter 
officials said 
one explosion blew off one of the legs of a british soldier 
guiding the helicopter to its parking position the royal air force 
said 
the two who died and three of the injured were aboard the 
helicopter airport officials said 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
numerous others on the ground had slighter injuries from flying 
debris 
british military officials were investigating the accident the 
helicopter was based in an air base at guetersloh about 65 miles

fontaine who said he was a pilot said he believed the accident 
was not caused by pilot error 
it wasnt the pilots fault he said the man on the 
ground underestimated the radius of the rotor blades in the turn 
officials said flames shot up more than 25 feet in the air and 
it took fire crews more than 30 minutes to extinguish the blaze

four out of five married women in beijing want 
two or more children despite the government policy limiting each 
couple to only one child according to a survey released today 
the official xinhua news agency said a survey of 7539 married 
women in the beijing area found that twothirds wanted two children 
and 138 percent wanted three or more it said just 199 percent 
were satisfied with one child 
the survey was conducted by the beijing statistics bureau 
of those women who already have a child 585 percent surveyed 
said they had agreed to respect the one coupleone child policy 
while 244 percent have not decided and 121 percent do not want to 
comply 
china adopted its onechild policy at the beginning of the 1980s 
in an attempt to limit its population now at 107 billion to 12 
billion by the year 2000 
the policy has been generally successful in urban areas where 
there are housing shortages and most women have jobs 
but the onechild concept has made little headway in the more 
conservative countryside where couples want boys to take care of 
them in their old age and children to help out on the farm 
many rural couples enriched by economic reforms that have 
brought back family farming have little difficulty in paying off 
fines imposed for having more than one child 
population experts now say relaxed attitudes toward family 
planning and the fact that couples from the babyboom generation of 
the 1960s are now starting their own families have pushed 
population growth beyond acceptable levels and made the target for 
the year 2000 impossible to achieve

an educator withdrew his name from 
consideration for president of north dakota state university on 
friday night after admitting he lifted part of a presentation for 
the job from a magazine article 
richard sauer acting president of the university of minnesota 
conceded he failed to credit the article in the speech given at 
ndsu in fargo nd on monday but said he had not been trying to 
claim authorship 
he called william c nelson chairman of the ndsu presidential 
search committee to say he was withdrawing from consideration 
nelson said 
i think he felt the controversy had gotten to the point that 
it would make it difficult for him to be an effective president at 
ndsu nelson said i urged him to stay to keep his name in for 
the running for the presidency but i was unsuccessful in changing 
his mind 
the 48yearold sauer vice president of agriculture forestry 
and home economics at university of minnesota before becoming 
interim president in march did not immediately return a telephone 
call friday night 
at issue was a speech to several hundred professors faculty and 
students at an open forum for the ndsu presidential candidate 
ndsu history professor larry r peterson said he recognized part 
of the speech as being nearly identical to points made by cornell 
university president frank rhodes in a guest column in the may 22 
1985 edition of the chronicle of higher education he said he had 
saved a copy because he was impressed with rhodes list of what 
graduates should get out of a college education 
at first i just couldnt believe it peterson said its 
insulting i guess its like heres someone trying to put 
something over on us 
he said he forwarded the information to the presidential search 
committee 
but the committee on thursday recommended sauer and three other 
to the north dakota board of higher education after accepting 
sauers explanation that he accidentally omitted the credit in 
trying to shorten his speech nelson said 
there wasnt any question that he did use a small portion of 
that speech nelson said but the other factor is the intent 
the majority of the committee felt there was no intent on his 
behalf 
i dont normally make citations in oral presentations of that 
nature because they interrupt the flow of the talk but i wasnt 
trying to claim any credit for authorship sauer said earlier in 
explaining the speech 
it was probably very close to verbatim he said 
university of minnesota regents chairman david lebedoff said 
friday night he could not comment because he knew nothing about the 
situation sauer became acting president after kenneth keller 
resigned in a controversy over spending 
nelson said the north dakota board of higher education plans to 
meet may 2223 to make its decision the schools former president 
laurel loftsgard died last year

king baudouin has asked outgoing prime 
minister wilfried martens to form a new centerleft coalition 
government to help ease the nations linguistic squabbles and 
economic problems 
martens 52 a dutchspeaking christian democrat met friday 
with the king and later with leaders of the coalitions five 
parties in hopes of this weekend forming belgiums 35th government 
since world war ii 
the next governments key task will be to change the 
constitution to make this nation of 55 million dutch and 45 
million frenchspeakers a federated state with more autonomy for 
its diverse regions 
other difficulties facing the nation include an 11 percent 
jobless rate among the highest in the european economic community 
it was expected that martens would head the fiveparty alliance 
which is comprised of christian democrats and socialists each 
split into dutch and frenchspeaking camps and the flemish 
nationalist party volksunie 
the five political leaders agreed this week on a government 
program after months of negotiations it was endorsed thursday by 
the congresses of their parties 
the parties will command 150 of the 212 legislative seats more 
than the twothirds majority needed to amend the constitution and 
grant more powers of autonomy to flanders belgiums dutchspeaking 
northern half and frenchspeaking wallonia 
constitutional reforms would give flanders and wallonia direct 
elections for their parliaments and make brussels which officially 
is bilingual a separate region 
martens centerright coalition his sixth government since 
1979 fell in a linguistic dispute oct 19 
that was followed by inconclusive dec 13 elections martens 
government has since served in a caretaker capacity

a 120000 fire in the office of house speaker 
jim wright has sparked a debate over the safety of congresssional 
buildings 
elliott carroll executive assistant to capitol architect george 
m white said friday that the congressional buildings are made of 
stone and brick and are as safe as any place in the world 
but rep curt weldon rpa a former fire chief whose office is 
next to wrights says there should be stricter fire safety 
standards for all federal buildings 
the issue came up after a small electrical fire thursday evening 
damaged a kitchenette in the office of wright dtexas in the 
longworth house office building 
the fire broke out about 6 pm on the secondfloor suite that 
houses wrights district staff in a building across the street from 
the capitol carroll said the fire started in a copying machine in 
the kitchenette 
weldon complained thursday night and friday morning that the 
fire which lasted 10 minutes could have been contained more 
quickly had there been fire hoses in hall cabinets and alarms in 
the offices 
weldon said the fire points to the need for congress and the 
federal government to come under the national fire standards that 
govern the buildings of private industry 
we need one set of standards all over weldon told 
reporters the federal government should accept no federal 
standards less than they require of private businesses downtown 
he said the longworth building lacks closed stairways fire 
alarms and smoke detectors in addition to fire hoses 
carroll denied that congress had once again exempted itself from 
legislation it has passed for everyone else in the nation such as 
the civil rights occupational safety and health and minimum wage 
laws 
he said the congressional complex is exempt from district of 
columbia fire regulations not by a law but because all federal 
buildings are exempt from local fire codes 
however he said the capitol hill buildings would meet the dc 
code and they meet and exceed the national standard 
carroll also said the architects office has begun a 475 
million modernization program to make the buildings safer against 
fire especially with the installation of voice fire alarms and 
smoke detectors 
all these buildings are fireproof said carroll the 
modernization program will make them safer 
weldon remained unconvinced saying he would move as quickly as 
possible to enact legislation to require that fire safety standards 
apply to all federal buildings 
it should come quickly he said its a wonder the 
government hasnt been caught with its pants down previously

vice president george bush wound up three days of campaigning in 
the west by referring to democrat jesse jackson as a hustler from 
chicago and saying he was troubled by some of the allegations 
against attorney general edwin meesee iii 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis meanwhile added to his 
super delegate totals by picking up the endorsement of six 
democratic governors jackson was crisscrossing california in 
pursuit of the 314 delegates at stake in the seasonending primary 
june 7 
im not going to be outhustled by the hustler from chicago or 
from that traditional liberal democrat from massachusetts bush 
told a group of republicans during a stop in lincoln neb on 
friday 
the allbutcertain republican nominee making a clear reference 
to jackson who has a home in chicago and the massachusetts 
governor also promised hed be back 
bush spokesman stephen hart said there was nothing 
derogatory in bushs comments the vice president was talking 
about how hard he jackson has hustled said hart 
bush is just trying to sound tough said jackson as he left 
a fundraiser in san francisco hes petrified at the thought of 
having to face me in a series of debates so hes already whining 
i do not know the context of his statement but that type of 
namecalling is beneath the dignity of the vice president of this 
country 
in an effort to head off the controversy that plagued him during 
the new york primary the first in a recent series of 21 dukakis 
primary victories jackson has set a may 18 meeting with about 100 
jewish leaders in los angeles 
dukakis gained the endorsements of the six governors while he 
took a break from campaigning to handle some statehouse business in 
boston and have a private weekend with his wife kitty 
the endorsement was announced by arkansas gov bill clinton who 
has been mentioned as a possible running mate for dukakis 
clinton said he and the other five governors cecil andrus of 
idaho steve cowper of alaska ted schwinden of montana george 
sinner of north dakota and michael sullivan of wyoming had 
withheld their endorsements until now to avoid the appearance of a 
stopjackson movement 
dukakis also got signals from from sen john glenn of ohio a 
former astronaut and himself a 1984 presidential candidate that he 
was available as a running mate if dukakis wanted him glenn said 
he was not campaigning for the job but that he would be glad to 
sit down and discuss it 
earlier in the day bush trying to counteract comments by aides 
depicting meese as a liability told reporters in iowa he hadnt 
authorized anything 
i know him well favorably but i must say i am troubled by 
some of the allegations bush said of meese i think fair play 
dictates that the system go forward and make the determination 
meese who denies any wrongdoing has been the subject of 
several investigations by an independent counsel for almost a year 
the attorney general has said he doesnt intend to resign and bush 
has never urged him to do so 
but recent comments by bush aides reported in the detroit news 
have provided democrats with campaign ammunition and turned meese 
into a political embarrassment in the eyes of some republican 
strategists 
meese is a liability peter teeley bushs communications 
director told the newspaper 
what a guy like meese does is take away the opportunity to 
discuss the issues that you really want to discuss teeley said 
i mean you are consistently asked about meeses problems how 
you deal with it how you stand one thing or another and that 
just totally diverts attention from the message that you are trying 
to get across 
and senior campaign adviser robert teeter said in interviews in 
washington this week all things considered you would rather not 
have that problem going on right now

the nation must be saved he said 
jackson focused his speech to the more than 1000 dinnergoers on 
the need to expand the democratic party to include the downtrodden 
and those abandoned by law 
california has the power to determine the next nominee of our 
party he said in los angeles where he made a series of 
appearances friday before flying to northern california 
he urged his supporters not to be discouraged by reports that 
the large delegate lead held by dukakis means the massachusetts 
governor will get the democratic nomination 
we can win this campaign we come to california the press 
the pundits and the party all writing off the jackson candidacy 
he told a rally at east los angeles college dont be deceived 
were coming on the last lap now its a long ways but i kept 
the faith 
in search of california votes for the biggest remaining hurdle 
in the primary season jackson on friday crisscrossed the 
metropolitan los angeles area from sunny beachfront santa monica to 
the heavily hispanic east side of town 
in one of the more dramatic events of a campaign known for its 
flair jackson delivered a stern lecture against gang violence and 
drugs to high school students in an area known for heavy gang 
activity 
he then got about 300 of the students voluntarily to come on 
down from the bleachers and admit to drug use and promise to do 
better 
i challenge you because i love you because i care because 
im not scared of you he said at fremont high school in san 
pedro some of the 3000 youths listening to him wore gang colors 
you know and i know its wrong to bring guns to school he 
said you dont need them no civilized caring person leaves 
home looking for somebody to hurt maim and destroy 
he then got the youths to pledge they would quit using drugs 
jackson also appealed to hispanic voters with a pledge to fight 
the movement to make english the official language in the united 
states 
englishonly limits our culture he said our future is in 
expanding our language base expanding our culture expanding our 
economy 
he also called for an extension of this weeks deadline for 
undocumented foreigners to apply for amnesty and stressed his 
proposal for a hemispheric energy plan and economic cooperation 
between the united states and latin american nations 
jackson continued calling for fairness in the democratic 
presidential delegate selection system to make the delegate count 
proportionate to the popular vote in each congressional district 
he told reporters he was not trying to provoke a party fight or 
mount a rules challenge as he had in 1984 but he clearly laid down 
a gauntlet when he said party leaders should make sure that the 
delegate count comes out to correspond with the popular vote even 
though the party rules to not require that 
jackson trails dukakis in the popular vote by 28 percent to 37 
percent but because not all delegates are chosen by popular vote 
dukakis leads jackson in delegates by 1505 to 927 according to 
the associated press tallies 
addressing an issue important to people dependent on 
californias large defense contracting industry jackson also 
proposed nonmilitary development of space as a way to recover 
defense industry jobs that would be lost under his proposed 
military budget freeze 
jackson declined to give specifics when asked by reporters to 
elaborate on how many jobs could be created in space development or 
how much spending he proposed

sandinista soldiers said rebels shot 
and wounded four government troops in what appeared to be the 
second violation of a ceasefire in as many days 
two government soldiers said friday that the shootings came late 
thursday after they tried to speak with the rebels 
on thursday the defense ministry charged that hondurasbased 
contras used speedboats to attack a nicaraguan military position 
wednesday the rebels did not comment on this 
offensive military operations between the leftist sandinista 
government and the usbacked rebels known as contras were 
suspended on march 21 
leaders of the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement two days 
later and a 60day truce went into effect april 1 during which 
they are attempting to negotiate a lasting peace 
luis noel solano jarquin a sandinista peoples army soldier 
told the associated press he was among a group of government troops 
who approached 40 contras in the town of el colorado 140 miles 
southeast of managua 
the contras told the soldiers that only top rebel and government 
leaders could conduct conversations between the two sides 
solano jarquin said from a hospital room in juigalpa about 65 
miles east of the capital 
suddenly we heard shots and had to disband he said 
solano jarquin was wounded in his left arm another sandinista 
soldier trinidad bermudez received fractured ribs and a broken 
forearm 
they said two other sandinista soldiers were wounded and being 
treated at a hospital in ciudad rama about 140 miles east of 
managua 
a defense ministry official said he had no information on the 
incident 
solano jarquin and bermudez said several armed confrontations 
have occurred between sandinista and rebel forces since the 
ceasefire was declared 
adan artola a commander for the indian rebel group known as 
yatama said friday that government troops recently attacked rebel 
positions in auyapinhi 270 miles northeast of managua 
in a telephone interview from miami artola said yatama fighters 
killed seven sandinista soldiers and wounded 23 in the incident 
yatama claims to have more than 4000 guerrillas whose objective 
is autonomy for nicaraguas indian populations on the caribbean

a column of police vehicles moved to the 
lenin shipyards main gate directing powerful beams of light at 
strikers manning it 
over a loudspeaker police said good evening gentlemen 
they revved the engines and came to a screeching halt about 35 
feet from the gate columns of riot police on both sides of the 
vehicles started beating the sides of the vehicles with their 
truncheons 
a few minutes later police withdrew 
again about three hours later police directed a powerful 
spotlight at the main gate a phalanx of police in full riot gear 
marched toward the gate banging their shields with truncheons 
the strikers instructed not to resist if the yard were stormed 
emptied the dining hall and rushed to the gate 
there was no panic they were very disciplined they just 
stood there silently said a reporter who was on hand but they 
were visibly shaken 
most of the strikers are young in their teens or early 20s 
later friday the tension apparently got to a young striker 
the man suddenly rushed to a window of the big secondfloor 
cafeteria where most of the strikers have been gathering smashed 
the glass and tried to jump out according to western reporters at 
the scene 
he was caught by his friends pulled in and taken to the nearby 
shipyard infirmary bleeding from his hands and face no one could 
say what prompted the action 
lech walesa immediately raced to the dining hall and climbed on 
a chair 
i have a personal request the solidarity leader began 
you know that solidarity is also taking care of the person next 
to you 
everyone has a thousand problems because he loves his wife 
and he must stay here another left 500 zlotys 125 to his wife 
when he left suddenly he realizes she has nothing to live on 
walesa told the crowd 
solidarity must be big here 
reporters said tension eased immediately after walesas 
impromptu speech 
the stoppage that began monday in the yard where the 
nowoutlawed solidarity free trade union movement was born in 1980 
was the only major strike remaining in a wave of labor unrest that 
began nearly two weeks ago 
early thursday riot police violently crushed a 10day 
occupation strike at the huge nowa huta steelworks outside the 
southern city of krakow 
at about the same time hundreds of riot police threw a security 
cordon around the gdansk shipyard 
on friday the yard was under virtual siege with police turning 
away food shipments 
walesa has clearly emerged as the man in charge of the strike 
although it is being coordinated by a 12man committee he gives 
advice and pep talks chats and jokes with strikers and tries to 
organize entertainment 
he sleeps on the floor on a styrofoam mat with the rest of the 
strikers using his tweed jacket as a pillow 
walesa helped found of solidarity the only officialy recognized 
independent labor federation in the soviet bloc before it was 
outlawed after a 1981 military crackdown 
after fridays attempted leap and walesas speech the strike 
committee quickly organized a song festival strikers played 
guitars and banjos and sang folk tunes and solidarity songs 
a member of the strike committee invited workers to come up and 
tell jokes 
strikers also undertook some chores such as cleaning the gate 
area 
the food situation was noticeably worse on friday after having 
soup loaves of bread sausage and spreads for their main meal 
thursday the strikers had only sauerkraut soup for lunch friday 
there were 800 to 1000 strikers left inside the plant 
according to reporters most of the strikers spend their time in

eastern airlines and labor leaders traded 
recriminations after the financially troubled carrier sued two of 
its unions for 15 billion accusing pilots and machinists of 
easternbashing 
the miamibased airline and its parent company texas air corp 
of houston charged the unions friday with trying to drive down the 
carriers value so the unions could buy it cheaply 
the smear campaign is one of a number of tactics to facilitate 
a takeover texas air attorney parker folse iii said of the suit 
filed in us district court in miami 
but henry duffy national chairman of the air line pilots 
association called the suit a desperate attempt to draw 
attention away from texas airs and easterns growing problems 
easterns alpa chairman john bavis said the suit is like the 
lions suing the christians for animal abuse he also dismissed it 
as a tactic to divert attention from a federal probe of the 
finances and safety of eastern and continental airlines also owned 
by texas air 
its clear evidence of a lastditch effort by a very desperate 
man and that mans texas air chairman frank lorenzo added 
machinists local president charles bryan in atlanta he accused 
eastern of attempting to shift public opinion which he claimed was 
leaning toward the employees 
bavis and bryan are named in the suit as are 11 other officers 
of the machinists union and the entire 26member governing council 
of the pilots union some 3500 members of easterns work force 
belong to the pilots union 12000 mechanics and other ground 
workers belong to the machinists 
the machinists contract dispute with eastern which seeks wage 
cuts of up to 50 percent is in federal mediation the pilots 
contract comes open for amendment july 1 
alpa the machinists and easterns transport worker union tried 
to buy eastern before texas air bought it in 1986 for 676 million 
a sale they then tried to block 
when the unions failed to block easterns sale to texas air 
they fought in court to overturn it and lost since then there 
have been several other suits and countersuits 
the eastern suit says the two unions still hope to obtain 
eastern which lost 900 million in the past 10 years 
they seek this by an allout effort to injure easterns 
business to make it a financial millstone for texas air by 
means of mail fraud wire fraud extortion further they 
have set out to destroy easterns good will and reputation the 
suit says 
the suit also claims that by promoting deceitful accusations 
about the safety of eastern defendants have induced the news media 
to join in an eastern bashing effort and have led the 
department of transportation and the federal aviation 
administration to conduct costly investigations of the airline 
all of which have further damaged easterns business 
the house public works and transportation committee approved a 
nonbinding resolution thursday urging the transportation 
department parent of the faa to widen the probe of eastern and 
texas air to include how the public and workers might be affected 
by company policies 
last month the faa announced it was seeking 823000 in 
penalties from eastern for past safety violations it then began a 
planebyplane inspection of the carrier last year eastern paid a 
95 million fine for violations 
also friday texas air spokesmen partly blamed unions for 
firstquarter losses of 1243 million on revenues of 21 billion 
eastern lost 645 million on revenues of 11 billion but the 
sale of 335 million in assets reduced that carriers net loss to 
31 million

david channell could be forgiven if he 
thought someone was giving him a load of bull at 630 in the 
morning when a caller said one of channells steers had fallen into 
a basement 
but when the 17yearold peered into his neighbors cellar 
friday i just started laughing its something you dont see 
very often 
there staring up at him was 1100 pounds of beef 
channell said the steer one of three hes raising for a 4h 
project had smashed through a gate to take an early morning 
stroll but its wanderings ended abruptly when it fell through a 
board covering the entrance to the basement of the neighbors 
trailer home 
while the bull story was making the rounds of the rural area 
the trailers owner channels father and several others worked for 
almost two hours to free the animal david channell said 
the steer was spooked by the cellar steps so they built a 
wooden ramp and covered it with dirt so the animal wouldnt slip 
channell said 
through it all the steer was unfazed 
he was real calm i just walked up right to him and put a 
halter on him he was just staring up at us channell said

i was immobilized i couldnt move and i didnt 
think to speak i just watched 
so begins joann bertes account of the night of dec 10 1979 
when she claims she was awakened on a friends porch in rhode 
island and carried in a paralyzed state aboard an alien spacecraft 
bertes story should be repeated in dozens of variations this 
weekend at a national conference expected to draw more than 250 ufo 
experts and people who claim to have been abducted by 
extraterrestrials 
it makes you very angry said berte who said she recalled 
the abduction under hypnosis years later they dont ask your 
permission they just take you away 
arthur myers a coordinator of the conference said the waltham 
gathering is one of the first public meetings of people who claim 
to have been held hostage by aliens 
it reminds me a lot of alcoholism or homosexuals coming out of 
the closet said myers theres a stigma attached to the 
abductees but once someone comes forward with their story others 
are willing to speak 
myers a member of a unitarian universalist church group 
interested in the study of the paranormal decided to sponsor the 
conference after attending a private ufo seminar in november in 
connecticut 
at first people thought it was too sensational a topic 
said myers but it is something the public should hear 
author ray fowler said about 80 percent of the ufo sightings can 
be explained 
but there are those instances that defy any explanation 
said fowler a former us air force intelligence officer scheduled 
as a keynote conference speaker its imperative that we study 
these things with an open mind not gullibly accept them or reject 
them out of hand 
from 1951 to 1955 fowler studied ufo reports for the us air 
force security service he currently heads the mutual ufo network 
an international group that documents ufo sightings

gen manuel antonio noriega says the 
reagan administration has has misinformed the us public about 
reported talks on conditions for his resignation as panamas 
military chief 
in an interview with the associated press on friday noriega 
said he is willing to talk with us officials about efforts to 
resolve the countrys political crisis but ruled out negotiating an 
end to his rule 
he also disclosed that president vinicio cerezo of guatemala had 
offered what noriega called a positive proposal he declined to 
provide details 
noriega said elliott abrams an assistant us secretary of 
state was bent on misinforming the people of the united states 
about conversations with panama because abrams previous advice 
to reagan on the crisis here has been a failure 
he said policy alternatives advocated by abrams were only 
damaging the reagan administration 
reports originating in washington last week said an agreement 
had been reached between noriega and a us envoy that would have 
noriega resign as chief of the 15000member defense forces but 
remain in panama 
the general denied any such agreements had been reached 
he said he has held conversations with southern and 
northern leaders on the crisis but there are no negotiations 
we do not negotiate the dignity of a country and do not negotiate 
the dignity of a man 
noriega is under indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges he denies he is guilty of the charges 
the us government imposed economic sanctions in an attempt to 
force noriega into exile after the general engineered the ouster of 
president eric arturo delvalle feb 26 the previous day delvalle 
had tried to fire noriega 
noriega said friday that panamanians wanted a democracy in the 
image and likeness of panama and not of the united states 
leave us alone let them not interfere with our tamoborito 
panamas folklore dance and we will not interfere with their 
political rock n roll he said 
noriega said the reagan administration wants docile 
governments in latin america instead of friendly ones that can be 
treated as equals 
the general agreed to the interview after he inaugurated a water 
line to the community of sajalices 45 miles southwest of panama 
city

the food and drug adminsitration is urging 
parents of small children to return any bottles of humco brand 
syrup of ipecac that remain in their home because they may contain 
a deadly poison 
as many as 400000 1ounce bottles have been mislabeled ipecac 
a product normally used to induce vomiting in children who are 
suspected of having eaten some dangerous product the agency said 
friday 
the mislabeled bottles may actually contain oil of eucalyptus 
which could prove fatal if given to children the agency said 
eucaluptus oil is used in minute amounts in vaporizers but if 
taken internally it can cause convulsions and coma officials said 
as little as a teaspoonful could prove fatal fda reported 
the fda initially announced a recall of the humco brand ipecac 
april 29 after the label mixup was discovered however since 
then it has learned that thousands of bottles of the product have 
been distributed to consumers across the country as part of poison

other electronic equipment or notice a display of lights in the 
northern sky this weekend it may not be your imagination 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration reported 
friday a geomagnetic storm sweeping over the earth may interfere 
with satellite radio and telephone communications

from the sun resulting in a display of northern lights known as 
the aurora borealis said joe hirman of the space environment 
services center in boulder colo they should be visible for a few 
nights he said

peaked on friday he said

scientists from several countries say the 
benefits of synthetic growth hormones received by some children 
outweigh the possibly slightly higher risk of developing leukemia 
those children face 
the cancer and growth experts who met to review 15 cases of 
leukemia worldwide in patients treated with synthetic growth 
hormones said an increased risk had not been proven but even if it 
had it is not great enough to warrant withholding treatment 
there is no therapy that is riskfree said a statement by 
the lawson wilkins pediatric endocrine society which represents 
doctors and scientists working in the field because gh therapy 
is essential for optimal growth and development in gh deficient 
children it would be inappropriate and unwise to withhold such 
treatment from needy patients 
the incidence of leukemia among patients taking growth hormone 
worldwide is estimated at 1 in 21000 patientyears of treatment 
the society said while a reasonable estimate of the risk among 
nonpatients in the same age range is 1 in 42000 
the meetings were prompted by reports of leukemia in five 
japanese children who had received the treatment 
the society said that if there is a relationship between growth 
hormone treatment and leukemia the cause could be the effect of the 
hormone on bone marrow cells

jurors hearing the nations first 
deathbyproducttampering case will return monday to try to break 
their stalemate in the trial of a woman charged with poisoning two 
people with cyanidelaced headache capsules 
us district judge william dwyer refused to declare a mistrial 
friday in the case against stella nickell despite a note from the 
jury foreman saying the panel appeared deadlocked during the fourth 
day of deliberations 
after three votes taken over the last three days we have been 
unable to reach a unanimous decision no juror has changed hisher 
vote during this time we await your instructions said the note 
from foreman murray m andrews 
before the jury returned dwyer told attorneys in open court he 
wanted to avoid a retrial in the case against mrs nickell who is 
accused of poisoning her husband and another woman 
i dont think we should give up on this jury yet a 
retrial is quite lengthy dwyer said 
at the request of the sevenwoman fiveman panel dwyer later 
read jurors a supplemental instruction on the legal term 
reasonable doubt 
on thursday dwyer refused to let the jury review testimony on 
whether the governments star witness cindy hamilton who is mrs 
nickells daughter first went to the fbi on her own with 
information against her mother or was approached by agents but the 
judge relented friday and directed the court reporter to read that 
testimony to the panel monday 
mrs nickell 44 of suburban auburn is charged with two counts 
of causing death by tampering with a product involved in interstate 
commerce and three counts of tampering 
the death counts carry maximum sentences of life in prison 
while the maximum for tampering is 10 years on each count 
the case is the first involving death by product tampering to go 
to trial a case concerning seven deaths from tainted tylenol 
capsules in chicago remains unsolved 
the federal charges stem from the deaths of mrs nickells 
husband bruce nickell 52 and sue katherine snow 40 also of 
auburn after they swallowed cyanidelaced extrastrength excedrin 
capsules in june 1986 
during the ensuing scare three bottles containing tainted pain 
relief capsules also were found on store shelves in and near 
auburn and excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers recalled all its 
overthecounter drug capsules 
assistant us attorney joanne maida charged in closing 
arguments that mrs nickell decided to end her marriage and money 
woes by killing her husband and collecting as much as 176000 in 
lifeinsurance benefits then tried to cover up the crime by 
placing tainted capsules in stores to give the appearance of random 
tampering 
ms snow was an innocent stranger caught in the scheme ms 
maida said 
federal public defender thomas hillier accused ms hamilton of 
lying when she said her mother talked of killing her stepfather 
with a drug overdose or by hiring a hit man before the tampering 
hillier also said there was no proof mrs nickell purchased any 
cyanide

an official of a panamanian opposition party who 
was expelled from his homeland said gen manuel antonio noriegas 
supporters are growing more and more desperate in their efforts 
to stay in power 
ivan romero secretary general of the christian democratic

being arrested beaten with a rock and held overnight in prison 
romero was detained thursday when he flew back to panama after a 
weeklong visit to the united states said perry rivkind local

unflattering to gen noriega rivkind said 
noriega is under indictment for drug trafficking in florida and 
the united states has called for his ouster from power 
romero told reporters he was taken to a military barracks 
immediately upon his arrival in panama stripped to his underwear 
and interrogated his interrogator held a sock containing a round 
stone which he swung in circles and twice used to hit romero on his 
feet he said 
he was asked a barrage of questions including what orders he 
received from the us ambassador what his partys plans were for 
the month of may and what his activities were with the opposition 
umbrella group national civic crusade 
at one point he said he hesitated and they reached down and 
hit me hard on the ankles said romero 
i thought they were going to tear my foot off said romero 
he said he refused to answer more questions and they stopped 
hitting him telling him later such methods were normal for getting 
answers 
romero said he was kept standing for seven hours and was 
initially told he was going to chile 
but friday morning his captors drove him to the airport stopped 
a pan american flight already on the runway and put him on it 
bound for miami

condor keepers hobbled the legs of a newly 
hatched california condor by wrapping them with a tiny gauze 
bandage in an effort to straighten out the chicks limbs the san 
diego wild animal park said 
the bandage was applied to molloko on thursday six days after 
the hatching of the first captivebred condor to correct a leg 
development problem known as splayed legs park spokesman tom 
hanscom said friday 
hanscom said the condition is not serious but it could become a 
hindrance to the bird if allowed to become permanent 
the same problem occurred in an andean condor chick born at the 
park and was successfully corrected by use of a gauze strip andean 
condors are closely related to california condors 
what we do is hobble the chicks legs this simply entails 
tying the leg above the feet with a strand of gauze that prevents 
the legs from spreading out to the side hanscom said 
the gauze was expected to remain in place through today 
molloko the first of the endangered species to be conceived in 
captivity is otherwise in excellent health hanscom said 
keepers are using a hand puppet built to resemble an adult 
condor to feed the chick molloko consumes some 15 diced baby mice 
during each feeding 
the splayedleg condition occurs in chicks that are raised on a 
hard surface or as with molloko on a towel hanscom said they 
are unable to gain traction as they attempt to stand unlike condor 
chicks in the wild that move on sandy surfaces 
because the chicks bones are still soft and the joints have yet 
to set the condition would become permanent if not attended to he 
said 
keepers could correct the problem by placing the bird on sand 
instead of a towel but that approach would be dangerous 
many birds raised on sand die of sand impaction hanscom 
said in which sand ingested by the bird creates a fatal blockage 
in the intestine 
the hatching april 29 of molloko raised the known california 
condor population to 28 all of the rare condors north americas 
largest land birds are in captivity with 15 at the wild animal 
park and 13 at the los angeles zoo

a strong earthquake shook northern japan today 
disrupting local transportation briefly but causing no serious 
damage or injuries officials said 
central meteorological agency officials said the quake which 
struck at 1059 am 959 pm edt friday measured a preliminary 
64 on the richter scale and was centered off the coast of 
hokkaido japans northernmost main island 
earthquakes registering six on the richter scale are considered 
severe and capable of causing widespread damage but the officials 
said little damage occurred because of the depth of the quakes 
epicenter an earthquake registering seven on the scale is 
considered a major earthquake 
a hokkaido prefectural police official said there were no 
reports of serious damage or injuries but trains on two local 
lines were halted briefly while tracks were inspected 
there have been two major earthquakes in hokkaido in the past 35 
years in 1968 the tokachioki earthquake killed 52 people 
the earthquake registered four on the japanese scale of seven in 
kushiro 560 miles northwest of tokyo three in aomori 360 miles 
away and one in tokyo the agency said 
a tremor measuring four on the japanese scale which measures 
ground motion at particular locations can shake houses 
the openended richter scale measures the total magnitude of a 
quake at its epicenter every increase of one digit represents a 
tenfold increase in magnitude thus a reading of 74 would be 10 
times stronger than one of 64 
the japanese and richter scales are not convertible

secretary of state george p shultz is 
planning a third shuttle trip to the middle east in june in a fresh 
attempt to promote arabisraeli peace talks 
a us official said friday a final decision is likely next 
week shultz would make stops in israel egypt jordan and syria 
seeking approval for a mideast conference that would sponsor two 
stages of negotiations 
the first would aim for three years of selfrule but not 
statehood for palestinian arabs in the israelioccupied 
territories the second would grapple with an overall settlement of 
the arabisraeli dispute 
shultz would fly to the middle east at the windup of the moscow 
summit meeting june 2 and then attend a meeting of the north 
atlantic treaty organizations foreign ministers in madrid june 
910 said the us official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
two trips by shultz to the middle east this year failed to 
produce peace talks but he refuses to give up whos afraid to 
struggle against odds he said at the end of the last venture in 
april what am i saving myself for anyway 
he also suggested that arabs and israelis despite their public 
lack of enthusiasm for negotiations had privately urged him to 
keep trying 
shultz told a senate appropriations subcommittee last week that 
under the right circumstances king hussein of jordan would be 
agreeable to the us proposal for a peace conference 
however shultz also testified that israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir had made the conference the centerpiece of his 
objections to shultzs plan 
shultz also was unsuccessful last month in moscow in trying to 
persuade the soviet union to accept a limited role in the 
negotiations 
shamir and shultz are opposed to giving the soviets a chance 
to shape the outline of a mideast settlement but hussein is 
insisting on soviet involvement 
on the other hand jordan is reluctant to negotiate with israel 
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost 
during the 1967 mideast war shultz has advised hussein that was 
not in the cards but he backs the idea of israel trading some 
territory on the west bank for peace and said the future of 
jerusalem should be decided in negotiations 
despite the long odds shultz said he did not think his plan was 
fated to failure 
shultzs plan called for a peace conference in midapril the 
opening of negotiations on the palestinians on may 1 and a second 
stage of talks on an overall settlement beginning dec 1 
the first two deadlines have passed still shultz has said he 
will keep trying to get negotiations started in the 8 months that 
remain to the reagan administration to give the next president a 
head start

the murder case against a former smalltown 
police chief ended with a grand jury refusing to indict him for the 
death of his wifes first husband who was found buried in the 
former officers yard 
i feel real fine robert chambers 36 said by telephone 
from a friends home friday night after the grand jury declined to 
return a seconddegree murder charge the former marlow police 
chief refused to answer any other questions 
assistant attorney general gregory swope said the case is closed 
without further evidence the prosecutor gave no explanation for 
the action 
in march state police dug up the body of russell bean in 
chambers yard in marlow a town of about 600 people in southwest 
new hampshire bean was the first husband of chambers wife sylvia

relatives said chambers father clifton told them shortly before 
his death march 9 that he helped robert bury the body using a 
backhoe 
police arrested chambers on april 15 and charged him with 
killing bean in 1978 shortly before sylvia moved in with chambers 
the two married a year later after chambers divorced his first 
wife deborah wentworth 
melissa chambers roberts sister told state police in an 
affidavit that bean then 25 died when he fell and hit his head 
during a fight with chambers 
after the skeleton was recovered pathologists determined bean 
had been beaten on the head and chest 
according to court papers the relatives said the elder chambers 
had told them not to say anything until after his death 
assistant attorney general gregory swope presented the case to 
the grand jury friday afternoon it returned its decision that 
night swope declined to say who testified before the panel 
swope said new charges against chambers would only be 
warranted if there were some developments in the case 
mark sisti chambers lawyer would not speculate whether the 
case was over but said i told chambers to stay in touch with me 
constantly 
after beans body was recovered chambers took leave and later 
resigned as parttime marlow police chief 
chambers also was parttime chief in gilsum william hasbrouck 
chairman of the selectmen said friday that chambers is on leave 
from the job 
the affidavits from chambers relatives also alleged that bean 
and chambers swapped spouses something sylvia chambers recently 
denied since beans body was discovered she has filed for divorce

the murder conviction of a teenager charged in 
the 1984 death of high school basketball star ben wilson has been 
overturned by a threejudge state appellate court panel 
in a unanimous ruling friday the appeals court said circuit 
judge james m bailey had violated the constitutional rights of 
omar dixon by refusing to try him separately from another 
defendant william moore 
the court ordered a retrial for dixon 
the 17yearold wilson one of the countrys leading prep 
basketball players was gunned down near chicagos simeon high 
school during the school lunch hour on nov 20 1984 
dixon then 16 and moore 17 were convicted of murder and 
attempted armed robbery in october 1985 dixon was sentenced to 
concurrent terms of 30 years for murder and 10 years for attempted 
armed robbery and moore was sentenced to 40 years for murder and 
10 for attempted armed robbery 
the defendants did not face the death penalty because of their 
age bailey said then that he levied a lighter sentence on dixon 
because he had done well in his jailroom classes 
what we have to do now is decide what to do said terry 
levin a spokesman for the cook county states attorneys office 
prosecutors are reviewing the appeals court decision he said 
friday 
before the trial attorneys for dixon had filed a motion to 
separate his trial from moores arguing that a joint trial would 
prevent dixon from challenging incriminating statements made by 
moore 
by denying that motion the appeals court said bailey denied 
dixon his constitutional right to challenge his accuser

archbishop desmond tutu denounced the 
united states britain and west germany for voting to block un 
resolutions calling for sanctions against south africa because it 
refuses to end apartheid 
the black anglican prelate told a un committee friday that 
south africa is able to cock a snoot thumb its nose to the 
world because the south african government knows that when it 
comes to the crunch president reagan british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and west german chancellor helmut kohl will 
use their veto to protect the south african government from the 
consequences of its actions 
we dont suggest that these worthies are racists he said in 
obvious sarcasm but it is an academic distinction 
the western countries say they deplore apartheid but think 
sanctions hurt the black population and do not help end the system 
of racial separation 
the united states and britain have veto power as permanent 
members of the un security council west germany does not have a 
veto 
tutu addressed a meeting of the un special committee against 
apartheid on the 25th anniversary of the committees founding 
south africa has defied all united nations resolutions 
condemning apartheid and calling for independence for namibia or 
southwest africa the south african ambassador recently stalked 
out of the security council and said it could do its damndest 
to impose sanctions on his country 
tutu who won the nobel peace prize in 1984 for his nonviolent 
efforts to end apartheid called the system as evil as immoral 
as nazism ever was 
is it too much to ask that in the land of our birth we walk 
tall as human beings made in the image of god to say we want 
to be free 
joining him were the rev allan boesak also an antiapartheid 
leader in south africa and almost 20 speakers who called for 
renewed dedication to the peaceful abolition of apartheid 
help us the archbishop appealed because we want the 
emergence of a new south africa where black and white people would 
live amicably together 
is it too much to ask to exert pressure to persuade the south 
african government to come to the conference table he asked 
apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
he condemned the ban on 17 organizations and individuals opposed 
to apartheid and also said the south african news media is severely 
restricted and collaborates in selfcensorship

dont offer 80yearold bernita boggs a 
penny for her thoughts about state tax collectors 
her life has been complicated by the bureaucratic hassle over a 
onecent error the agency said she made on her 1987 illinois income 
tax return 
i always thought if it was less than a dollar they just let it 
go but maybe mr gov james thompson is hardup for money 
mrs boggs said friday 
ed miller the womans lawyer said he cannot believe the turn 
of events 
ive never seen anything like it in my 20 years in the 
practice of law miller said ive never had a client who got 
billed for 1 cent that is absolutely ludicrous 
i wonder if she had overpaid by 1 cent if they would have sent 
her a check for one penny probably they would have which is even 
more ludicrous said miller 
it all started when miller caught an error on boggs state tax 
form shortly after the return was mailed to springfield 
the attorney discovered that due to a change in the tax law this 
year the havana woman was no longer entitled to the tax exemption 
formerly granted to people older than 65 
on feb 5 miller filed an amended tax return for her he 
determined she actually owed 382 more than had been previously 
paid the additional payment was sent along with the amended return 
for a couple of months boggs thought all was fine but it 
wasnt so 
here last week i got a letter from the state and i started to 
read it of course im 80 years old and dont understand all these 
things she explained 
miller said he didnt really understand it either but he 
believed it involved a problem with a decimal point he said that 
when he did the computation for the tax return he carried it out 
to the second decimal place 
you dont normally carry it out to the 10th decimal place to 
find out theres an additional penny due he said 
but thats what the state of illinois did 
the letter from the state acknowledged receipt of boggs 382 
but stated she really owed 383 
please pay 001 it stated 
the errant taxpayer wrote a check for one cent to the illinois 
department of revenue 
even writing the check posed a problem because mrs boggs had 
never written a check for such a sum 
she didnt know how to write it out how do you write 1 
cent miller asked 
postage to send the check to springfield was 25 cents on top of 
the 45cent stamp the revenue department used to send its letter to 
havana 
so all totaled the postage on both letters was 70 cents for a 
tax due of one penny now that just doesnt make sense miller 
said 
verenda smith an agency spokeswoman said she was unaware of 
the case but suggested a computer may be to blame 
we dont typically bill a person for a penny she said i 
dont think a human would have done that 
god bless computers eh ms smith added

rescuers found three more bodies in the rubble of a louisiana 
oil refinery blast bringing the death toll to six with one worker 
still missing in all nine people were confirmed dead this week in 
three fiery disasters nationwide 
late friday an explosion at a fourth site a pulp and paper 
mill in roaring spring pa spewed chemical fumes that prompted 
the evacuation of the towns 2600 residents authorities said 
forty people were treated for respiratory problems but no serious 
injuries were reported 
the pennsylvania blaze erupted about 10 pm in the boiler room 
of appleton papers inc authorities said it was brought under 
control by midnight and residents began returning to their homes 
early today police said 
in henderson nev site of a rocket fuel plant leveled by 
explosions residents were alarmed friday by news that the plant 
had been cited four times in the last five years for serious safety 
violations 
we dont have a facility big enough here to hold all the 
protesters if they try and rebuild there said city manager gary 
bloomquist id be totally amazed if that was allowed to happen 
the thunderous blasts wednesday which registered earthquake 
force on seismographs killed two workers and injured several 
hundred residents 
in los angeles where a fire devastated the citys tallest 
skyscraper fire officials legislators and politicians called for 
a law requiring sprinklers in highrise buildings the blaze which 
began late wednesday killed one person and injured 40 
in louisiana the three bodies found friday night at the shell 
oil co refinery in norco were so badly burned they could not be 
identified immediately company officials said 
rescuers planned to search again today for the last missing 
victim of the explosion and fire which injured 42 early thursday 
the search was hampered by several small fires thick smoke and 
huge pieces of mangled equipment 
workers with protective clothing and oxygen tanks found the 
bodies of two men early friday in the control room of the 
gasolinerefining unit that exploded the body of another was found 
near the flaming catalytic cracker shortly after the blast 
the occupational safety and health administration and the 
environmental protection agency sent investigators to assist in 
determining the cause of the blast in the 25yearold catalytic 
cracking unit 
you have to see the devastation to believe it the area around 
the cat cracker is really tore up said dean perniciaro 
president of the oil chemical and atomic workers union local 
chemical engineers said they could find no record of an 
explosion by a catalytic cracker 
in henderson worried residents sought to keep another henderson 
rocket fuel plant shut demanding assurances there is no danger of 
a repeat of wednesdays explosions 
weve created a monster of fear said henderson city 
councilman michael harris i dont think anybody other than maybe 
some of those that really knew the plants knew the potential hazard 
inside 
harris said he received numerous calls from residents voicing 
opposition to rebuilding the plant which pacific engineering and 
production co said it would do within six months 
state officials released information friday showing pacific 
engineering received four citations for serious violations that 
resulted in fines since 1983 but jim barnes the state industrial 
relations director refused to say what the violations were 
our opinion is that overall their record has been a good 
moderate record barnes said 
henderson officials met with executives from kerrmcgee corp 
which also manufactures ammonium perchlorate and voluntarily halted 
production thursday but kerrmcgee said its plant has operated 35 
years without an accident 
two pacific engineering executives were killed and 326 people 
were treated for injuries after the four powerful blasts which 
severely damaged scores of henderson buildings city manager gary 
bloomquist said initial damage estimates exceeded 100 million 
six people remained hospitalized including a 5dayold baby cut 
by flying glass 
in los angeles the cause of the fire that killed a janitor 
injured 40 other people and destroyed 4 floors of the 62story 
first interstate bank tower remained under investigation 
the tower built in 1973 lacked sprinklers which fire 
officials said would have minimized the disaster the citys fire 
code was changed in 1974 to require the safety devices 
fire officials said the initial damage estimate of 450 million 
was thought to be too high and was being recalculated

thennew selfdefense law after he was charged with shooting a

moslem guerrillas attacked 
afghanistans second largest city with rockets and grenades 
killing eight communist party officials it was reported today 
agency afghan press a private pakistani newsletter said the 
strike occurred last saturday in the provincial capital of 
kandahar 280 miles south of kabul 
it said the officials of the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan were meeting at the party office protected by an 
armored vehicle outside aap said the vehicle was destroyed after 
its afghan crew escaped 
the statement said five other officials were captured when 
they were fleeing away it said all five were taken to rebelheld 
areas for trial 
there was no independent confirmation of the report 
guerrillas fighting afghanistans sovietbacked government are 
known to control most of the mountains and desert plains 
surrounding kandahar whose population of 200000 reportedly has 
dwindled to 20000 since the war began nearly 10 years ago 
the guerrillas have captured a series of important posts 
recently in eastern afghanistan as soviet forces have turned them 
over to government troops in preparation for the scheduled may 15 
start of the soviet withdrawal 
about 115000 soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in 
december 1979 to back the government the soviets have agreed to 
pull out under an april 14 agreement in geneva 
the fall of kandahar would be a serious blow to the marxist 
government of president najib it would reinforce widespread fears 
that the afghan army will be no match for the heavilyarmed 
guerrillas once the soviets leave

a west german company said a 
chemical used in nuclear weapons had gone to switzerland instead of 
west germany but a prosecutor said the transaction is not illegal 
there does not appear to be a violation of the law said 
jochen ruhland a spokesman for the duesseldorf prosecutors 
office he said west german law does not consider the nuclear 
material heavy water to be radioactive 
the norwegian government on wednesday said 15 tons of norwegian 
heavy water were illegally diverted in 1983 to an unknown 
destination by the duesseldorfbased rohstoff einfuhr firm 
the norwegian foreign ministry said rohstoff einfuhr stated that 
the heavy water was for scientific use in west germany and that its 
transport to another destination violated its licensing codes 
a official for rohstoff einfuhr denied the allegations 
we never left anyone in the dark that the shipment was 
intended for switzerland said a company official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the oslo newspaper verdens gang reported april 21 that the heavy 
water was flown on a liberianregistered west african airlines 
plane via basel switzerland to dubai then probably to a nuclear 
reactor in bombay india 
norway does not allow the export of heavy water to countries 
that have not signed the international nuclear nonproliferation 
agreement including india 
the ministry said it had so far determined only that the heavy 
water was sent by air freight to basel 
norwegian officials have asked west german officials to 
investigate 
heavy water or deuterium oxide is used as a coolant in some 
nuclear reactors but it can also be used to produce plutonium for 
use in nuclear arms india has several nuclear reactors that use 
heavy water

rival shiite moslem militias battled with 
tanks rockets and howitzers today for control of the slums of 
south beirut police said at least 40 people were killed and 61 
wounded 
explosions echoed across the capital and smoke billowed from 
fires in apartment blocks in several parts of the denselypopulated 
district hospitals issued urgent appeals for blood 
most of south beiruts estimated 250000 residents spent the 
night in basements and bomb shelters as gunmen fought in the narrow 
alleyways 
police said firefighters could not enter the area to quell 
blazes set by the rival groups 
according to police count 56 people have been killed and 111 
have been wounded in two days of fighting between the prosyrian 
amal militia and the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
as the shiites battled calm prevailed in two nearby palestinian 
refugee camps after heavy clashes friday between rival guerrilla 
factions in which police said 14 fighters were killed and 46 
wounded 
a police official speaking on condition of anonymity said amal 
deployed dozens of sovietmade t54 tanks early today in a bid to 
storm hezbollahs three main strongholds in south beirut 
hezbollah made up of shiite zealots loyal to irans ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini is believed to be an umbrella for proiranian 
factions holding most of 18 foreign hostages including nine 
americans in lebanon 
most of the captives are believed to be held in the southern 
slums 
amal also shelled key intersections in an effort to block 
hezbollahs supply lines the police spokesman said 
the fighting broke out before dawn friday when four amal 
militiamen were killed in a south beirut ambush amal blamed 
hezbollah 
the lebanese red cross and civil defense said their teams 
evacuated dozens of casualties from the battle zones 
dozens of other casualties remain in the streets in areas 
subjected to shelling and automatic weapons fire we havent been 
able to evacuate them a civil defense spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
machinegun fire closed the main highway leading to beirut 
airport on the southwestern edge of the disputed area but 
travelers managed to reach the airport through side streets and 
flight schedules were not affected police said 
the clashes were the heaviest between the two factions since 
amal cracked down on hezbollah in shiitedominated south lebanon 
last month sixtytwo people were killed and 150 wounded in that 
fourday battle 
syria is irans main arab ally in the 7yearold war against 
iraq but the syrians have become increasingly alarmed at the 
iranbacked hezbollahs drive to dominate lebanons 12 million 
shiites the biggest single sect in the country 
the fundamentalists seek to create an iranianstyle islamic 
republic in lebanon considered by neighboring syria to be its zone 
of influence 
police said it could not be determined if the feuding 
palestinian factions had agreed on a ceasefire 
fridays fighting was the latest in a series of confrontations 
in the battered camps between guerrillas loyal to palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafat and the radical 
fatahuprising group 
syria the main power broker in lebanon sent 7500 troops into 
moslem west beirut feb 22 1987 in a bid to end three years of 
militia anarchy 
but the syrians have not moved into the shiite stronghold of 
south beirut apparently to avoid a headon collision with irans 
allies 
syria also maintains 25000 troops in eastern and norther 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate linked to the 
13yearold civil war between lebanons christians and moslems

a large 
convoy of oil tankers and merchant vessels escorted by us and 
british warships sailed through the tense strait of hormuz without 
hearing so much as a peep from iran 
it was as though iran did not exist this guided missile 
frigates captain edward mann told a pentagon media pool of 
fridays remarkably quiet voyage into the gulf of oman 
he said that no iranian gunboats or warships were sighted nor 
was there even any routine radio or radar conyact during the 
cruise which reached the open waters off oman near midnight 6 
pm edt 
they either learned a lesson or are planning something new 
one crewman said on the darkened bridge as the convoy left behind 
the strait 
the williams and a british destroyer hms gloucester made their 
way through the strait riding shotgun for a herd of tankers and 
merchant vessels 
about 10 ships traveled along with the warships in the largest 
convoy through the waterway since fierce usiranian naval clashes 
april 18 
other convoys are waiting for escort service at the mouth of the 
strait 
president reagan last week gave permission to the navy to aid 
ships flying other than american flags if they come under attack 
but cmdr mann said that when the british convoy moved alongside 
dubai it was little more than coincidence 
its a small ocean out here he said earlier on his 
sunbaked bridge as british and american helicopters crossed in the 
sky ahead of the convoy the deck temperature on the williams was 
measured at 126 degrees friday afternoon 
diplomatically i guess it has been difficult to get all these 
countries to agree to coordinate their polices he said but we 
keep in touch out here and i certainly would not sit by and watch 
if any aircraft attacked the gloucester 
the 3700ton guided missile frigate williams protected two 
kuwaitiowned but americanflagged oil tankers it was flanked by 
four tankers escorted by the 4000ton glouchester 
iraq on thursday said it hit an iranian naval target this has 
in the past provoked quick iranian retaliation on ships in the gulf 
and tehran has also vowed revenge for its losing battle with the 
us navy on april 18th 
this was the fourth usled convoy that passed unchallenged 
through the strait within range of irans silkworm missile 
batteries since the april 18 clashes

surgeons completed a rare doublelung 
transplant operation on us rep floyd spence of south carolina 
early today officials at the university of mississippi medical 
center said 
spence 60 was in critical but stable condition following the 
5hour surgery which ended at 3 am said hospital spokeswoman 
barbara austin 
spence suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease flew to 
mississippi friday afternoon from columbia sc after being 
notified of a possible set of donor lungs in texas 
the transplant team said the surgery proceeded as 
anticipated austin said hell remain in the hospital probably 
four or five weeks to recuperate 
members of the transplant team flew to texas friday afternoon 
and returned late friday night with the organs after determining 
the lungs were in good enough shape to transplant hospital 
spokeswoman janice quinn said 
surgeons opened spences chest about an hour before the lungs 
arrived at about 1045 pm hospital officials said 
spence appeared alert and in good spirits as he was wheeled into 
the hospital the legislators son david spence said the family 
was confident about the outcome of the operation 
the surgeons are very optimistic about the condition of the 
donors lungs with floyds physical condition and with his 
tolerance to the operation said randy mashburn spences 
district administrator they are very upbeat 
at one point last october spence was put under intensive care 
at bethesda naval hospital in maryland in critical condition 
afterward the congressman went on the list of potential organ 
transplant recipients 
doublelung transplants have been performed 30 times worldwide 
and only 12 times in north america three times at jackson and 
nine times at toronto general hospital under the auspices of the 
toronto university school of medicine 
eight of the toronto patients are still living but only one of 
the three from jackson remains alive university medical center 
officials attributed one of the two deaths to factors unrelated to 
either the surgery or respiratory ailments that led to the 
operations 
dr sesshadri raju professor of surgery and director of the 
transplant program at jackson said last month that with a normal 
recovery spence would be able to resume a normal schedule after 
six months with surprisingly few physical restrictions 
confined at times to a wheelchair and occasionally in need of 
oxygen spence has made few public appearances since his october 
hospitalization 
however he has filed for reelection the nineterm republican 
will face democrat jim leventis in the november election

israels sweep into south lebanon last 
week broke longstanding taboos against risking confrontation with 
syria and on attacking proiranian guerrillas holding us hostages 
the twoday operation law and order signaled a new israeli 
willingness to get involved in lebanon despite the national trauma 
suffered by a threeyear occupation of lebanon that cost nearly 700 
lives and deeply divided the jewish state 
as in israels 1982 invasion the incursion triggered a debate 
on the defense ministers failure to notify the cabinet of his 
plans to launch a largescale military action near syrian army 
lines 
it also risked reprisals against foreign hostages held by 
proiranian groups in lebanon although comment on this issue was 
muted in israel 
in a twopronged thrust a force of about 1500 israeli soldiers 
and allied south lebanon army militiamen pushed beyond the six to 
10mile border security zone for the first time since february 1986 
they came up emptyhanded in a sweep of sunni moslem villages 
near the western slopes of mount hermon limiting their action to 
distributing leaflets warning residents not to cooperate with 
palestinian guerrillas 
a second column of israeli tanks and infantry backed up by 
helicopter gunships fought a short but fierce gunbattle with 
hezbollah guerrillas dug into the abandoned village of maydoun 12 
miles north of israels border israeli officials said 40 
guerrillas and three israeli soldiers were killed 
uri lubrani the defense ministrys coordinator for lebanon 
policy said the army was prodded into action by 12 palestinian 
guerrilla raids that disrupted life in northern israel and cost the 
lives of 11 israeli soldiers since november 
he and other israeli officials suggested that if such raids 
failed to keep the border safe israel might have to adopt the 
dreadful option of invading lebanon as it did in 1982 
whatever we are doing along the border and this operation was 
just one facet of a whole mesh of activities is all designed to 
one purpose to avoid the possibility that we will have to move 
into lebanon in force with divisions and stay there lubrani 
said in an interview 
the searchanddestroy mission came within a few miles of syrian 
army lines in lebanon raising fears of a confrontation with the 
sovietbacked government in damascus 
the liberal daily haaretz suggested rabin changed targets in 
midcourse and attacked a hezbollah base near syrian lines after 
failing to find palestinian guerrillas in villages near mount 
hermon 
there is reason to ask whether it was necessary to take such a 
risk by increasing the penetration range to the point of proximity 
to the syrian military positions in order to prove that the 
incursion was not launched in vain said haaretz 
defense ministry officials insisted the hezbollah base at 
maydoun was targeted from the onset 
we are facing syrian influenced areas from which terrorist 
activity against israel is being initiated therefore the syrians 
must know that something is bound to happen if this continues 
said lubrani 
rabin was also attacked for failing to notify the 25member 
israeli cabinet of his plans to launch a major operation in south 
lebanon that risked confrontation with syria 
abba eban chairman of parliaments foreign affairs and defense 
committee rejected rabins explanation that the operation was 
routine and did not need government approval 
such an operation on such a scale and with the possibility of 
entangling results because of the closeness to the syrians i dont 
think it may be called routine he said on israel tv 
among those israel radio reported to be critical of rabins 
failure to notify the cabinet was former defense minister ariel 
sharon who was himself attacked for failing to keep the government 
informed about his 1982 invaision 
rabin said actions to protect the northern border did not 
require advance cabinet approval and his spokesman eitan haber 
noted rabin informed prime minister yitzhak shamir but shamir was 
quoted by the daily maariv newspaper as saying he was not aware it 
would be on such a wide scale 
the operation also broke a previous reluctance reportedly based 
on a us government request for restraint not to attack shiite 
moslem guerrillas in lebanon for fear of endangering us and other 
foreign hostages including two israeli soldiers captured by 
hezbollah guerrillas in february 1986 
lt gen dan shomron armed forces chief of staff was quoted in 
an interview with the daily yediot ahronot newspaper as saying 
israel had been avoiding certain areas but said there had been no 
american veto on such attacks 
there never was a general veto there were certain places 
regarding which we didnt know if there were prisoners or not and 
therefore we had to be careful shomron said 
critics also said the proiraninan hezbollah or party of god 
would quickly rebuild destroyed bases and might attack israel 
proper instead of limiting its actions to south lebanon 
why hezbollah uzi mahanaimi asked in a frontpage 
commentary in the mass circulation yediot ahronot daily 
hezbollah is not the israeli armys main enemy in south lebanon 
and hasnt tried to penetrate into northern israel 
other analysts suggested it was futile to try to wipe out 
guerrilla bases because they would only reappear elsewhere they 
argued such military action only threatened to escalate violence 
and drag israels army back into lebanon 
yossi olmert a middle east expert at tel aviv university 
predicted a long hot summer on the northern border 
there is no doubt that the hezbollah absorbed a heavy blow 
but it was not a death blow said olmert this battle may give 
them additional motivation we can expect them to enlarge their 
operations

far from the glare and hoopla of the 
presidential campaign 12 men will set to work tuesday on a problem 
that could spell the difference between success or failure for the 
next administration 
the group is the national economic commission created by 
congress to find solutions to the huge federal budget deficits 
many believe the commission headed two savvy political 
insiders democrat robert strauss and republican drew lewis offers 
the best hope of finally breaking the impasse that has nearly 
paralyzed the budget process for most of president reagans tenure 
the presidents stand against tax increases and congress 
refusal to slash social programs has given the country a flood of 
red ink the national debt will be approaching 3 trillion when 
reagan leaves office three times what it was when he campaigned in 
1980 on a pledge to balance the budget by 1984 
but with unemployment falling to levels not seen since 1974 and 
the country into a record sixth year of peacetime prosperity the 
high budget deficits have remained a distant abstraction little 
noted in the presidential debate 
for one thing mention of the deficits opens a candidate to 
pesky questions about how he intends to solve the problem 
while experts believe tax increases will be an inevitable part 
of any solution walter mondale mentioned the tword in 1984 and 
lost 49 states a fact not lost on this years crop of presidential 
candidates 
that is where the national commission comes in if things go 
according to script the blue ribbon panel which holds its first 
public hearing in washington on tuesday will quietly go about the 
business of crafting a workable menu of budget cuts and tax 
increases far out of the limelight of the presidential campaign 
after nov 8 the presidentelect will add two representatives 
to the commission for the final round of dealmaking the completed 
package will form the basis of his grand budget plan which he will 
present to congress soon after taking office during the honeymoon 
period when his influence is highest 
protected by the political cover from the prestigious 
commission congress will swallow the bad medicine of cutting 
popular programs and raising taxes and the deficit dragon will be 
slain 
the script sounds wonderful but many observers give it only a 
5050 chance of working partly because solutions to the deficit 
problem have proven so elusive in the past 
every time we make a serious attempt at tackling the deficit 
problem we run into roadblocks because there is no solution that 
doesnt end up hurting somebody said nigel gault an economist 
at data resources inc either a favorite government program gets 
cut or taxes get raised 
another reason for the pessimism is the fact that vice president 
george bush has taken pot shots at the commission mainly because 
one of its main supporters was sen robert dole of kansas his 
chief rival for the republican nomination 
in a campaign ad in new hampshire bush charged that the 
commission was created to provide political cover for a tax hike 
if it doesnt recommend a tax increase ill eat not only my hat 
ill eat bob doles hat 
the idea for the bipartisan commission to deal with the deficit 
problem was advanced by new york gov mario cuomo and sponsored in 
congress by dole and sen patrick moynihan dny 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the democratic frontrunner 
hasnt attacked the commission but the panels supporters still 
worry that without the active participation of the next president 
the recommendations are doomed to gather dust alongside the reports 
of countless other government task forces 
the commission whose members were appointed by reagan and house 
and senate leaders must report back to congress by march 1 but 
both strauss and lewis mindful of the importance of getting 
recommendations to a new president early have said they expect to 
beat that deadline 
commission advocates are betting that strauss a washington 
attorney and former us trade representative and lewis former 
transportation secretary and now head of union pacific corp will 
have the negotiating skills to bring success 
many economic forecasters are already telling clients that they 
expect tax increases next year regardless of who is elected 
president 
the wefa group of bala cynwyd pa said likely targets for more 
revenue include increases in the top personal income tax rate 
further scaling back of deductions and a boost in energy taxes 
possibly by combining an oil import fee with higher gasoline taxes 
wefa president lawrence chimerine said he believed a national 
consensus was growing that would support strong measures to shrink 
the deficit 
maybe people dont completely understand the significance of 
the deficit but they are beginning to have an uneasy feeling about 
the future chimerine said the deficit is a longterm problem 
which saps the vitality out of the economy on a longterm basis 
in addition to strauss other democratic members of the 
commission are moynihan who was also on the social security 
commission rep william gray chairman of the house budget 
committee chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca aflcio president 
lane kirkland and felix rohatyn partner with the new york 
investment firm lazard freres 
along with lewis republican members are caspar weinberger 
former defense secretary in the reagan administration donald 
rumsfeld former defense secretary in the ford administration sen 
pete domenici ranking republican on the senate budget committee 
rep bill frenzel rminn a member of the house ways and means 
committee and dean kleckner a rudd iowa farmer and president of 
the american farm bureau federation

members of the strike committee at the 
lenin shipyard held their first meeting with management today an 
opposition source said a communique said the strikers were cold 
and hungry but wouldnt give up the fight 
three members of the strike committee churchappointed mediator 
tadeusz mazowiecki and an unspecified number of management 
officials were there said the source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the source spoke at st brygidas church a stronghold of the 
banned solidarity trade union federation that is near shipyard he 
said no other details were available 
it was the first such meeting since the strike for higher pay 
and legalization of solidarity began monday in the worst wave of 
labor upheaval in poland since the 1981 military crackdown 
riot police surrounded the yard thursday prompting fears that 
they would storm the shipyard like they did the nowa huta steel 
mill in krakow three days ago 
today those fears diminished according to a strikers 
communique issued from the shipyard 
 
the shipyard is still isolated from the city but there is no 
feeling of siege the communique said and the zomos riot 
police are in fact invisible except for the third gate and the 
railway gate where police vehicles are parked nearby 
veteran dissident adam michnik said the government would 
probably not raid the gdansk shipyard where the solidarity trade 
union federation was started in 1980 
it seems they are going to use a different scenario than in 
nowa huta he said they probably want to take the shipyard by 
hunger 
food has been choked off since thursday and the strikers were 
able to share only sauerkraut soup friday it was not known what 
they would eat today 
the polish government continued to crack down hard on union 
activists sentencing several to prison terms 
janusz onyszkiewicz the national spokesman for the solidarity 
trade union federation was sentenced to six weeks in prison in 
connection with interviews he gave to western media according to 
warsaw opposition spokesman ewa milewicz 
in gdansk czeslaw nowak a solidarity dockworker activist was 
sentenced to three months on friday bogdan lis regional head of 
solidarity in gdansk was given a threemonth term for calling an 
illegal strike 
the sentences were the harshest imposed on solidarity activists 
for union activities since a 1986 political amnesty 
at least seven other activists were reported detained 
in addition a draft of a bill obtained by western news 
agencies in warsaw indicated the polish government might toughen 
antistrike laws as a means of countering labor unrest 
polish authorities say the strikes are undermining plans to 
reform the economy 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski told a bankers group 
that certain groups were using the nations economic difficulties 
as an excuse to fight socialism but he acknowledged that some 
elements of the economic reform hadnt been effective enough 
the strikers communique said three members of the strike 
committee met with the bishop of gdansk tadeusz goclowski at 8 
pm friday and again with a church representative this morning 
the communique said a priest from goclowskis curia was allowed 
into the shipyard and celebrated mass for the strikers friday 
evening a source said one topic of the talks with goclowski was to 
arrange a big shipyard mass on sunday 
the strikers main problem was lack of food cigarettes 
hygiene and bad weather the communique said 
the communique made no mention of a suicide attempt friday by 
one young striker after the attempt solidarity leader lech walesa 
gave a moralebuilding talk and the strikers took steps to organize 
themselves more effectively 
strike sources said walesa told an unidentified deputy manager 
that the workers given the opportunity to run the yards 
themselves could save the shipyards economic situation 
the deputy manager echoed government concern that the shipyards 
were on the verge of bankruptcy 
strikers reportedly laughed down a suggestion by the deputy 
manager that they accept a small raise the sources said strikers 
also are demanding legalization of the local chapter of the 
independent trade union solidarity freedom for political prisoners 
and reinstatement of fired workers 
the recent wave of labor unrest began april 25 with a successful 
oneday stoppage by transit workers in the northwestern city of 
bydgoszcz the workers won a 60 percent raise 
prices in poland have risen 42 percent price so far this year as 
part of the governments austerity program 
no disturbances were reported friday in the southern city of 
krakow where riot police on thursday crushed a 10day strike at 
the nowa huta steel mill 
polands roman catholic bishops denounced the police action 
solidarity the only independent union federation ever 
officially recognized in the soviet bloc was chartered by the 
government in the fall of 1980 during strikes across the country 
it was suspended in december 1981

associated press writer 
washington ap how many states are in the union who was the 
first president must the president be a citizen 
officials at the immigration and naturalization service say 
these are the types of questions that ins examiners will ask people 
granted amnesty who want to seek permanent us residency 
a person is eligible to seek permanent resident status 18 months 
after applying for amnesty the oneyear amnesty program expired at 
midnight wednesday so some legalized aliens will become eligible 
for permanent residency starting in november 
immigration commissioner alan nelson was put on the spot at a 
news conference thursday when a reporter told him critics of the 
ins say that the civics test questions are not as simple as nelson 
suggests 
what right is provided in the 15th amendment to the 
constitution the reporter asked nelson 
i dont know about the 15th amendment responded nelson 
ive seen a list of questions and i havent seen that one on 
there 
when the reporter asked nelson the date of the start of the 
american revolution nelson answered im not here to go through 
testing 
the 15th amendment passed during reconstruction gave blacks the 
right to vote the revolutionary war began on april 19 1775 when 
british redcoats clashed with massachusetts militiamen at lexington 
on friday ins spokesman verne jervis said the questions asked 
by the reporter arent on the current list and that the questions 
asked of nelson mischaracterized the whole testing process its 
misleading to an alien who may fear that hes going to have to 
answer a question like this 
abc correspondent bill greenwood who asked nelson the 
questions said he was reading from one of four versions of the ins 
test supplied by the federal agency at the networks request 
jervis said the questions sent to abc were assembled for school 
children nationally as part of the bicentennial observance of the 
writing of the constitution 
ins officials clearly upset by any impression that immigrants 
are being asked questions that even us citizens cannot answer 
made the following points 
applicants dont have to answer the questions but if they 
dont they must enroll in a course teaching history civics and 
english in order to get a permanent residency card 
the inscertified courses currently available to more than 
250000 people a year who seek to become naturalized citizens are 
given through local school districts and nonprofit organizations 
the test itself is an oral exam not a written one and we 
only ask each applicant half a dozen to a dozen questions out of 
a list of 15 or 20 enough to satisfy the examiner that you know 
something about this country and can speak some english said 
jervis were not going to ask you about the 15th amendment 
other questions on the current list include the number of 
houses in congress the name of a member of congress representing 
your state and the name of the highest court in the country the 
harder questions on the current test include naming two of the 
first 13 states 
testing for those granted amnesty and who are seeking permanent 
residency is required under a provision of the 1986 immigration 
reform and control act

leontina albina doesnt expect much special 
attention from her children on mothers day she didnt raise the 
53 of them to be like that 
children grow up and they go away she says thats a 
mothers life 
according to the guinness book of world records she is the most 
prolific woman alive the book records 55 registered births before 
1981 and she says shes had four since then six died at birth or 
shortly afterward 
mrs albina says she raises her children to be independent 
i tell them dont worry about taking care of me ive still 
got my own good hands to work with she said in an interview at 
her home i tell them try to end up better than me 
besides can you imagine if they were all still here what a 
problem that would be she added her tanned and weathered face 
crinkling in a big smile 
a problem indeed mrs albina her husband gerardo and the 18 
children who remain at home share a cramped tworoom wooden shack 
on the edge of a slum in colina a rural community 20 miles north 
of santiago 
the rickety house has electricity but no running water the 
children bathe in a small battered enamel washbowl in the dusty 
backyard next to the outhouse 
why in such poverty would a woman have so many children 
mrs albina says she and two brothers were abandoned as infants 
in neighboring argentina to the care of a churchrun orphanage 
when she was 5 years old her brothers were adopted she remained 
behind heartsick and made a vow i told myself when i become a 
mother ill always keep my children and never give them away 
she kept the pledge 
at 12 years of age she left the orphanage to marry gerardo then 
a 30yearold mule driver she said the children came quickly in 
threes and twos 
i was a triplet myself i think thats why i always had 
triplets or twins she said 
the first 21 children were boys earning her an award from the 
argentine government but leaving her dissatisfied i cried you 
know i really wanted a girl 
she would have them during the familys emigration from 
argentina to chile in 1953 they crossed the andes mountains on 
mule and she gave birth during the rugged twoweek journey in a 
snowstorm two girls and a boy the boy didnt survive the trip 
in all she would give birth to 18 girls including twins now 15 
months old 
will there be more 
mrs albina shrugs if god sends them to me yes but id like 
god to also consider me now that im approaching old age 
she says she is 59 although guinness puts her age at 62 her 
husband admits to 73 but mrs albina said hes really pushing 
80 
she said she tried birth control with an intrauterine device 
but i got pregnant anyway and nearly died i think it was a 
punishment from god for doing something i shouldnt 
many of the children are scattered around the world two are in 
japan two are in the united states one is in switzerland another 
is in sweden and a dozen or more live in argentina 
she has trouble keeping track not only of locations but of 
names there are three susanas three miriams two estrellas and 
two soledades 
those still at home keep her and her husband struggling to make 
ends meet 
according to mrs albina the family goes through 2 pounds of 
sugar a day and 20 pounds of potatoes every two days about 2 
gallons of cooking oil and 160 pounds of flour last a month 
although the family sometimes cant make ends meet she says 
the smallest always eat first the smallest and then the bigger 
ones weve always done that 
the government family allowance and pension benefits bring in 
about 120 a month nowhere near enough so they use the money to 
buy woolen yarn wholesale in santiago then comb the countryside in 
a horsecart selling it doortodoor on a good day they can make 
about 10 
their fame also sometimes brings a little extra journalists who 
visit often bring along a little gift and occasionally a big one 
in december a japanese tv station paid for the couple and six of 
their children to visit tokyo for a week 
but the publicity sometimes hurts she said it gives us 
illusions mrs albina said in the end we have to come back 
to reality

less than a month before the summit in moscow 
washington has been hit by a deluge of kremlin advisers who have 
been issuing reports shaking hands and posing for pictures with 
american politicians academics and journalists 
the soviets have been refining their techniques for wooing 
americans since the first meeting between president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in november 1985 in geneva 
in geneva articulate soviet spokesmen appeared before american 
television cameras explaining gorbachevs policies and opening up 
some previously taboo topics to debate 
at the iceland summit in october 1986 the soviets put on an 
even better show gennady gerasimov the smoothtalking foreign 
ministry spokesman got officials who usually operate behind the 
scenes to dutifully field questions 
for the washington summit last december the soviets trotted out 
even more bigwigs including arms control expert gen nikolai 
chervov economist abel aganbegyan and others thought to have the 
ear of kremlin decisionmakers 
the us advisory commission on public diplomacy a government 
board said the washington summit was as much of a worldwide 
media event as it was a bilateral encounter 
and it said to combat the proliferation of soviet officials 
made available to the media the american government should send 
its officials and spokesmen to moscow before the summit begins 
there on may 29 to explain and advocate us summit objectives 
hundreds of american journalists are expected to travel to 
moscow for the may 29june 2 summit and valentin falin head of 
the semiofficial novosti news agency said in an interview they 
would have priority access to soviet officials during the

government newspaper izvestia and others of only slightly lesser 
prominence 
the parade continued on april 25 with the arrival of yevgeny 
velikhov who is president of the soviet academy of sciences and is 
thought to be a close adviser to gorbachev on star wars nuclear 
and other technical issues 
during his stay velikhov signed an agreement with the us 
nuclear regulatory commission to exchange safety information met 
with department of energy officials and attended a series of 
seismological tests near the nevada test site to prove the 
feasibility of monitoring lowlevel nuclear tests 
another kremlin insider space scientist roald sagdeyev was hot 
on velikhovs heels delivering an address before the national 
academy of sciences on the possibility of a joint expedition to the 
martian moon phobos

before george bush could savor his decisive 
triumph in the battle for the republican presidential nomination 
conservatives and moderates launched intensive drives to set the 
vice presidents ideological compass in advance of the fall 
campaign 
conservatives drew up their short list of acceptable running 
mates and demanded bush reassure them he will adhere to their 
version of the ronald reagan agenda 
but while the right has been most vocal in pressuring the vice 
president gop moderates also are bombarding him with arguments as 
to why he should shift to the left 
the vice president accedes to the right at the risk of his own 
independence and election prospects said rep jim leach of iowa 
an early supporter of bush in the state where the vice president 
suffered his most humiliating defeat of the nomination campaign 
the advice comes from a dazzling range of republican thinking 
from richard m nixon rep newt gingrich of georgia a leader of 
young house conservatives and a group of reaganites calling 
themselves the western states political caucus to that vanishing 
breed of gop liberals like leach and gov thomas h kean of new 
jersey 
the tugowar over bush reflects widespread uncertainty over 
his true views 
seven years of unswervingly loyal service as reagans vice 
president earned bush valuable conservative support in the race for 
the gop presidential nomination but to many conservatives he 
remains suspect the man who battled reagan a little too hard and a 
little too long for the 1980 nomination the man who coined the 
phrase voodoo economics supported the equal rights amendment 
and was perceived as prochoice on abortion 
those who are struggling to move bush to the left or the right 
may exaggerate the vice presidents problems unifying his 
republican base 
george bushs problem uniting the party is considerably less 
than it was for ronald reagan in 1980 said richard wirthlin 
reagans pollster 
his big challenge is not in uniting a republican base said 
wirthlin but rather in beginning to reach out to the very large 
number of republicans who will split their tickets and people who 
dont have any anchor in either party 
said gingrich it is clear that bush is a man who was not 
intrinsically part of the goldwaterreagan movement 
at the same time the congressman who supported rep jack kemp 
of new york for the gop presidential nomination described bush as 
broadly conservative and added that he demonstrated he could 
campaign on reagankemp issues better than kemp could 
gingrich is making his peace with bush and has his own advice to 
offer including suggestions that the vice president adopt an 
agenda the congressman describes as humanitarian conservatism 
and portray democrat michael dukakis as party of the looney 
left 
he dismissed gop moderates by saying the socalled mainstream 
republicans are a small trickle 
nixon is quoted as advising bush that he cant win the 
presidency with conservatives alone but you cant win the 
election without these people 
bush campaign manager lee atwater would turn the vice 
presidents fuzziness on issues into an asset 
he is the umbrella candidate for the republican party said 
atwater he is the single best candidate to represent all the 
varying groups inside the republican party 
atwater contended that polls of republicans found bush has a 
lions share of support of moderates he had a lions share of 
support of the conservatives a lions share of support of the 
evangelicals and a lions share of support of those who call 
themselves very conservative 
the vice presidential nomination is the focus of many 
conservatives who view it as a test of bushs commitment to their 
agenda 
western republicans want bush to select one of their own 
interior secretary donald hodel sens james mcclure of idaho 
orrin hatch of utah or john mccain of arizona or gov george 
deukmejian of california 
more intriguing are the lists drawn up by conservatives of 
running mates who would be unacceptable to them people such as 
kean treasury secretary james a baker iii or former senate gop 
leader howard h baker jr also high on such lists would be 
republican mavericks like sens lowell weicker jr of connecticut 
and bob packwood of oregon 
leach who thinks howard baker would be the ideal bush running 
mate calls such demands the height of mischief 
its wrong said kean the choice ought to be by the vice 
president 
party moderates dont expect to have the influence to outgun the 
conservatives on a matter like the vice presidential choice but 
they harbor hopes of getting some of their views into the platform 
i have modest hopes but not great expectations said leach 
he cited education the environment and arms control as areas 
where he would like to see changes from the very conservative 
platform adopted at the 1984 republican convention 
weicker plans to hold alternative platform hearings to hear 
views on domestic issues views that will have little chance of 
turning up in the official party platform 
kean said he disagreed with much of what was in the 1984 
platform but to me the platform is not very important it never 
has been to me whats very very important is not what the 
platform says but what the candidate says 
consultant roger stone whose clients run the ideological range 
from kemp on the right to kean on the left said he would expect 
a little fireworks over the platform but that republicans 
arent that very far apart on issues any more 
no longer he said does the party have a goldwater wing and a 
rockefeller wing that waged bitter ideological battles two decades 
ago the triumph of reagan meant that for the immediate future at 
least all the power is in the hands of the conservative wing

the nations roman catholic bishops have told 
young people to avoid schoolbased clinics that offer 
contraceptives and to accept instead that the only 100 percent 
safe way to avoid pregnancy is to reserve sexual activity for 
marriage 
in a 1000word message addressed to the youth of our 
country the national conference of catholic bishops asserted 
this past week that clinic operators believe that the only way to 
help you cope with your sexuality is to provide you with 
contraceptives 
they assume that young people will be involved in sexual 
activity and cannot achieve selfcontrol that will lead to healthy 
physical and spiritual growth we know that there are better 
solutions the bishops said 
the bishops message contained in brochures available for 
widespread distribution said that unlike clinics schools 
parents and churches teach you honesty moral responsibility 
promisekeeping selfcontrol commitment and respect for other 
persons to help you reserve sexual activity for marriage 
the bishops rejected the argument that schoolbased clinics 
which dispense contraceptives help decrease the number of unwanted 
pregnancies among teenagers they said we believe that the wide 
availability of contraceptives confirms teenagers in their harmful 
sexual behavior

horoscopes arent as popular as comic strips and 
obituaries and surveys find few people willing to admit they are 
guided by the stars but astrology is firmly rooted in american 
culture 
part of it is amusing and a parlor game but unfortunately 
some people take it seriously says paul kurtz chairman of the 
committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the 
paranormal 
if it is the case that the us delayed the inf signing due to 
astrological predictions that is serious kurtz said 
what he was talking about of course was the disclosure by 
former white house chief of staff donald regan that nancy reagan 
consulted astrologers about her husbands schedule including the 
signing of a nuclear arms limitation treaty with the soviet union 
her spokeswoman later confirmed that mrs reagan did indeed 
consult astrologers but the president said he had never based a 
policy decision on a horoscope 
if true thats just a darn shame according to joelle mahoney 
president of the 140member astrologers guild of america 
using an astrologer to me is just one more piece of input 
for the president to make a decision she said friday 
to determined skeptics such as kurtz astrology is just another 
instance of what hl mencken once called the virulence of the 
national appetite for bogus revelation 
a survey of 2000 adults conducted last year by the public 
opinion laboratory of northern illinois university found that 
twothirds were regular or occasional readers of horoscopes and 36 
percent thought astrology was scientific however only 7 percent 
said they ever adjusted their plans based on their horoscopes 
new york telephone gets a million calls a month at 28 cents a 
call for its dialahoroscope lines however according to 
company spokesman steve marcus three to four times more callers 
dial for weather forecasts 
the gallup poll hasnt asked adults about astrology since 1978 
when it found that 29 percent of the respondents said they believed 
in it more people expressed belief in such things as extrasensory 
perception and deja vu said colleen mcmurray of the gallup 
organization but astrology ranked higher than the loch ness 
monster and bigfoot with only 13 percent believing in them 
barry karr who works with kurtzs committee said gallup polls 
of children aged 1317 found that belief in astrology increased 
from 40 percent in 1978 to 52 percent in 1986 in contrast the 
number of those who believed in esp fell from 67 percent to 46 
percent and belief in the loch ness monster dropped from 31 percent 
to 13 percent 
in newspaper readership surveys anywhere from onefifth to 
onehalf of those surveyed say they read the daily horoscope said 
deanne termini executive vice president of belden associates of 
dallas a newspaper marketing research firm it averages out to 
about one out of three readers she said 
by comparison obituaries editorials comic strips and the 
dear abby or ann landers columns are followed by about 50 
percent of newspaper readers she said while 20 percent do the 
crossword and only 5 percent bother with the bridge column 
as far as mrs mahoney of the astrology guild is concerned 
newspaper horoscopes are about the worst press that astrology 
has 
the true science of astrology is quite complex and there are 
no two astrological profiles that are the same she said 
robert w cooper executivesecretary of the american federation 
of astrologers in tempe ariz takes a kindlier view of newspaper 
horoscopes saying they at least serve to interest people in the 
art 
the federation has between 4000 and 5000 members cooper said 
adding that not all are astrologers he estimated that the number 
of americans involved in serious astrology is no more than 
50000 astrologers and clients included 
all in all cooper said the publicity generated by the white 
house connection made it a good week for astrologers and he didnt 
seem at all surprised that it came on the same week the federation 
was observing the 50th anniversary of its founding on may 4 
1938 in washington dc 
cooper and mrs mahoney say astrology cant predict anything 
even with the help of computers which have cut the time for 
casting a horoscope from six hours to 20 seconds mrs mahoney 
said we dont promise anything we simply view ourselves as 
mapreaders 
we can advise you for instance that the aspects in effect 
make you accidentprone for the coming period said cooper 
however he said astrology cant predict whether an accident will 
happen 
the risk of making predictions was demonstrated last week by 
ostaro the hindu astrologer who volunteered to peer into 
president reagans future for the associated press 
in addition to predicting tuesday that reagan might have some 
foot and knee injuries next year ostaro volunteered a prediction 
that the chicago white sox would beat the new york yankees that 
night the yankees won 
despite skepticism astrology has even had its moments in court 
in 1985 the california supreme court overturned an azusa city 
ordinance which banned fortunetelling astrology palmistry 
tealeaf reading and other occult arts 
the only dissenting justice malcolm lucas argued that a 
municipality has the right to protect its citizens from their own 
gullibility 
but justice stanley mosk wrote for the majority when such 
persons communicate their beliefs to others they are not acting 
fraudulently they are communicating opinions which however 
dubious are unquestionably protected by the constitution 
mosk noted that many other people purport to predict the 
future including economists investment counselors political 
pollsters and clergymen who describe the concept of a 
hereafter

alligators once were threatened with 
extinction in florida but now theyre all over the place and will 
be subject to legal hunting this fall for the first time in 26 
years a state agency has decided 
the florida game and fresh water fish commission agreed friday 
to hunting in 28 selected areas after the florida audubon society 
challenged rules that would have permitted a countybycounty or 
statewide hunt 
audubon officials said the larger hunt would have killed too 
many alligators and wasnt what the legislature intended when it 
passed a law that lifted gatorhunting restrictions 
we did what they asked said scott ball a spokesman for the 
commission the designations were approved without debate 
the next step is to go to those areas and decide how many 
alligators can be taken from each ball said 
the commission is scheduled to make that decision in july after 
staffers conduct an alligator census in the swamps and lakes 
the commission plans to permit 15 percent of the adult gators 
in each area to be harvested 
alligator hunting and trapping was banned in the early 1960s 
when the reptiles were threatened with extinction and they were 
given national endangered species status in 1973 they have since 
made a comeback and have been removed from endangered and 
threatened species lists 
biologists say there is no way to make a firm estimate of the 
statewide population but rough guesses have ranged from 1 million 
to 6 million biologists say they have evidence the gators are 
outgrowing their habitat and some may starve if the population 
isnt reduced

businessman guy smith met jesse jackson across a 
negotiating table in 1981 when smith was a vice president for 7up 
corp and jackson was pressuring corporations to expand 
opportunities for blacks 
they met several times with subordinates and alone coming up 
with a covenant under which 7up agreed to spend 61 million to 
improve its minority hiring and spending program 
today smith says i am a republican but if jesse is the 
democratic nominee i will vote for him 
he never one time wanted us to give something to somebody he 
wanted us to give opportunity for blacks which ultimately was 
great for the 7up business recalled smith now a phillip morris 
vice president 
it was a different side of jesse jackson that smith and other 
corporate executives saw different from the man the public had 
come to know as a fiery spokesman for black concerns who led 
street demonstrations railed against city hall blasted the 
administration in washington and spouted militant rhetoric 
the public jackson as head of his civil rights organization 
operation push people united to serve humanity was honing his 
skills as a champion headline grabber always able to seize on an 
issue or tactic that would put push in the news 
during those years he began to develop a less flamboyant side 
with the tactics of conciliatory persuasion that he is showcasing 
in his campaign for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination 
for instance he was given credit for successful mediation of 
the devastating 1980 chicago firefighters strike 22 people died 
in fires during the strike after marathon sessions with blacks 
who were insisting on affirmative action before they would unite 
with white unionists and with white firefighters and city 
officials 
that side of jackson has become more dominant in the years since 
his 1984 presidential bid 
gone are the dashikis blue jeans and leather vests that were 
the uniform of jacksons youthful protest days 
also gone is much of the confrontational rhetoric typified by 
his remarks on the day he launched push in 1971 power must not 
be blind it must be used to picket vote and if necessary to 
engage in civil disobedience we will be as nonviolent as we can 
be and as violent as we must be 
in chicago it is difficult to find many associates who dont 
offer the observation that jackson has grown and matured since 
those days 
today in impeccable business suits and silk ties jackson 
projects himself as a conciliator and mediator holding himself 
above the fray of campaign attacks and holding out the promise of 
understanding to all constituencies 
even in the heat of the new york primary when mayor ed koch 
called jackson a liar jackson brushed it off 
one former critic chicago radio commentator lu palmer says he 
set aside his misgivings about jackson after determining his ego 
wasnt as big as it used to be 
i was one of jesses greatest critics in the 70s i was not 
convinced he was as serious about the movement as he was about 
himself palmer said i had quit attending push because i was 
convinced jesse was not for real now im one of his biggest 
supporters 
but some say its the old jackson in a new package 
jesse is for jesse everything else is no 2 said marshall 
field former owner of the suntimes newspaper he declined further 
comment 
many who have been critical in the past seem reluctant to say 
anything negative about jackson today as he glows in the successes 
of his presidential campaign 
former chicago mayor jane byrne contends jackson was always 
capable of both protesting and trying to bring people together i 
dont see him any different today she said 
but jackson backers point out that times have changed since the 
south carolina native arrived in chicago as a semininary student in 
the early 1960s and jackson has changed with them 
those were the days when he was absolutely confrontational 
said bishop hh brookins of the african methodist episcopal 
church a longtime ally that was the only way he got coverage 
was to be confrontational hes much more thoughtful now than he 
once was i attribute that to maturing at the public level 
in the push days when jackson was fighting to improve the 
economic and political clout of blacks he achieved many of his 
goals through boycotts or the threat of boycotts public attacks on 
adversaries during revivalstyle push meetings and an ability to 
mobilize black followers 
recognized today as a master at using the news media jackson 
made every effort to cultivate reporters especially those from the 
black press said nate clay a former push spokesman and now editor 
of the weekly chicago metro news 
a workaholic who has skimmed several newspapers by 6 am 
jackson knew how to make headlines clay said he gave his staff 
tips on how to give reporters short snappy quotations 
he did not hesitate to call up editors and make his views 
known on editorials and stories and before long jackson was the 
one who was called by reporters for comment on the various civil 
rights stories of the day 
if i was critical of him hed almost always call and try to 
talk it out said chicago tribune columnist mike royko even if 
i was 100 percent right id spend the next three days walking 
around with my liberal guilt throbbing 
royko said jackson tried to persuade rather than intimidate him 
but a former chicago suntimes official said that jackson would 
make threatening calls unless the suntimes did exactly what he 
wanted 
he would say it was antiblack and threaten to make a 
public uproar over the matter said the newspaper official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity

on one occasion jackson saw a new black reporter on tv clay 
recalled 
he started asking around the room who is that a week or so 
later this reporter was at jesses house jesse told him he had an 
exclusive for him 
that was typical of the way jackson would cultivate anybody 
who could do him a favor clay said jesse has a knack of going 
around picking up people like some people pick up stray dogs 
he certainly was very fiery in those days said chicago 
political consultant don rose who now says his previously reported 
description of jackson conniving to grab the mantle of the slain 
dr martin luther king has been overblown 
rose said in a recent interview that the day after kings 1968 
assassination in memphis jackson asked rose to set up a couple of 
tv interviews for him in chicago 
in general conversation according to rose the two subsequently 
fell to discussing how jackson had terrific potential to become 
the leader of the movement 
but rose said there was no concerted plan as he had been quoted 
saying to engineer that eventuality 
in any event jackson for two days wore a turtleneck even in a 
king memorial service of the chicago city council stained with 
what he said was kings blood 
he told the council i come here with a heavy heart because on 
my chest is the stain of blood from dr kings head 
jacksons biographer barbara reynolds said that more than 100 
articles in the year after kings assassination reported that 
kings blood was on jacksons shirt and that jackson had cradled 
the dying leader or that he was the last person king had spoken to 
all these details are disputed by some king associates who were 
present on the balcony of the lorraine motel in memphis tenn 
where king was shot 
jackson has been vague in more resent interviews on the events 
in memphis he said in an interview on televisions phil donahue 
show in april that it was not true he had not touched the dying 
king he said he ran up to the balcony after a sheet had been put 
over the body i then got up from a very bloody scene he said 
blood was everywhere 
mistrust of jackson lingers from those days kings widow 
coretta scott king and some other civil rights colleagues refuse 
to endorse jackson 
in his campaign jackson frequently cites his ties to king but 
the rev hosea williams an atlanta city councilman said jackson 
could never work as a team person with king or other members 
of the southern christian leadership conference 
williams recalled a staff meeting where jackson stubbornly 
challenged kings ideas 
it got so ridiculous that dr king got up and walked out as 
he got to the door he turned around and he said jesse if you 
want to start your own national orgnization you can do so but you 
dont have to destroy me 
ultimately jackson split with sclc leaders over finances and 
the leadership of the operation breadbasket arm of sclc which he 
headed 
jacksons longtime friend and pastor the rev clay evans 
contended some were jealous of jackson because of his stature and 
support 
in chicago he was the movement evans said without him 
there wouldnt have been any movement 
jacksons fame grew as he took on everything from housing 
discrimination and youth problems and signed minority opportunity 
pacts with such companies as anheuser busch burger king heublein 
and coca cola 
one day he would be launching boycott against coca cola telling 
blacks dont choke on coke the next day he might be pledging 
to defeat a proposed police chief or school board member 
nobody wants to be on pushs socalled list said heublein 
spokesman erik pierce he wasnt just a ragtag individual he was 
head of a significant organization 
push had 32 chapters nationwide and jacksons weekly sermons 
were carried on live radio every saturday 
i think anybody that was in business knew about jesse 
jackson said frank sellinger former head of schlitz brewery 
the schlitzpush pact was signed before sellinger arrived in the 
late 1970s but he said he heard from jackson later when jackson 
fought the brewerys efforts to force out an unprofitable black 
distributor 
if push decided to get on your case about something you got a 
real fight on your hands said evans push became the eyes the 
ears and the feet of the black community 
those who dealt with jackson say he was as canny and in control 
behind closed corporate doors as he was firing up his followers 
it wasnt a lot of yelling but it was youre going to do 
this said pierce of heublein 
he was very businesslike i found him to be tough but fair 
said former schlitz spokesman ben barkin he said jackson made it 
clear his demands were either or else 
former heublein spokesman john cox said he never dreaded going 
to the push negotiations jackson was electric and charismatic 
and a sharp negotiator

liberal and conservative wings of the united 
methodist church often in conflict over issues such as 
homosexuality seemed to find a middle ground and reached a 
surprising reconciliation at their justconcluded governing 
conference 
weve seen here a real coming together said the rev dennis 
m campbell of duke university divinity school in north carolina 
there has been a great spirit of inclusiveness and openness 
bishop earl g hunt of lakeland fla outgoing president of the 
council of bishops said we moved back to our moorings 
the 96millionmember united methodist church the second 
largest in american protestantism next to the southern baptist 
convention wound up its 11day conference friday night 
the conferences centerpiece achievement was a new doctrinal 
summary adopted overwhelmingly by the nearly 1000 delegates after 
keen differences between liberals and conservatives were amicably 
resolved in committee 
that 10000word document covers basic beliefs emphasizing the 
primacy of scripture but also affirming the value of theological 
exploration 
as the churchs compass for the years ahead it drew accolades 
from all sides conservative liberal and inbetween 
terming it a miracle the rev donald messer a denver 
theologian who had objected to an earlier draft as suppressive 
applauded the modified and approved version as a win for everyone 
it also was hailed by conservatives the rev james heidinger of 
wilmore ky head of an evangelical caucus called good news said 
it provided a good distinction between doctrinal norms and 
theological process 
both wings also indicated that same sort of satisfaction with 
other major decisions by the conference including its adoption of 
a new hymnal and stands on homosexuality 
while the church traditionally has been socially activist 
conservatives had charged that it had swung too far in that 
direction 
righteousness prevailed said the rev edmond robb an 
evangelist from marshall texas liberals listened to the grass 
roots there has been a mellowing on both sides 
from the other camp the rev james a wall of chicago 
influential methodist editor of the ecumenical weekly christian 
century said what impressed me was the more conciliatory mood 
as a liberal i was not bothered to see a clear shift to 
accommodate conservatives in the church 
he said national church leadership previously had gotten out 
of step with the constituency and called the new position more 
centrist 
the high level of consensus was indicated by overwhelming 
concurrence in the key votes usually more than 80 or 90 percent of 
the delegates only on subsidiary matters did any wide divisions 
show up and these were rare 
the lengthiest debate nearly four hours came on the issue of 
homosexuality the debate ended with the church reaffirming its ban 
on active homosexuals in the ministry and condemning such activity 
generally 
but the vote on that also showed strong support 80 percent 
in affirming this stand although we do not condone the practice 
of homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible with 
christian teaching we affirm that gods grace is available to 
all 
that phrase was added to point up inclusion of everyone 
whatever their sins within the churchs caring so were several 
confessions of the churchs insufficient understandings of sexual 
complexities 
the church ordered a comprehensive scientifictheological 
inquiry into homosexuality as well biblicalethical analysis 
homosexuality has proved to be particularly troubling to 
conscientious christians of differing opinions the church said 
with important questions remaining in dispute 
its a tacit recognition that there is some legitimacy to 
various points of view said the rev george mcclain of new 
yorks staten island executive of the methodist federation for 
social action 
a big conference step was adoption of an updated 960page book 
of ritual psalms and hymns sticking to masculine imagery in the 
lyrics about god but using sexually inclusive language about 
people 
there also are three new hymns allegorically portraying the 
feminine aspects of god and added hispanic black korean and 
other ethnic songs and spirituals 
delegates stiffened their stand on abortion condemning it as 
means of birth control or for selecting a babys sex 
summing up the conference the rev spurgeon dunnam of dallas 
said 
traditional categories of right and left just dont fit this 
conference the pronounced effort has been to come together to 
build consensus ive sensed a lot of moving toward each other

a federal judge was moved by a swiss familys 
problems with immigration officials so he had his clerk draw up 
the paperwork and made them citizens on the spot 
you come off the bench thinking this is what they hired you to 
do said us district judge carl rubin its called justice 
pietro and birgitte semadeni and their sons reto and fortunat 
have been in the united states since 1975 and in the cincinnati 
area for six years 
they thought the immigration and naturalization service had 
granted their request for permanent residence in 1981 so they 
applied for citizenship 
nothing happened 
they hired an attorney hope levitt frye who asked rubin on 
friday to order the ins to act on the citizenship request she said 
ins agents in new york repeatedly lost the familys request for 
residency and that unusual paperwork delays occurred after their 
residency hearing took place 
ms frye said that despite the delays ins officers assured 
semadeni that his permanent residency had been approved and told 
him he could switch jobs 
semadeni came to the united states with a swiss company and left 
to join borden chemical co in cincinnati he now runs his own 
importexport chemical company 
ins attorney russell a elzot admitted the agency made mistakes 
but argued that the semadenis were in this country illegally 
because the head of the family switched jobs before winning 
permanent residence 
rubin ordered the ins to include the semadenis in a june 
naturalization ceremony but ms frye jumped up and urged rubin 
do it today 
she explained that the ins could initiate deportation 
proceedings before the naturalization ceremony and that the 
semadenis could be ineligible for naturalization if immediate 
action were not taken

voters got 24 hours of calm saturday to decide who 
will be their next president after a tumultuous week during which 
hostages were freed in lebanon and new caledonia and the candidates 
ended their campaigns 
president francois mitterrand 71 a socialist seeking a second 
sevenyear term remained the favorite in sundays runoff against 
55yearold conservative premier jacques chirac 
still chirac was expected to benefit from the release wednesday 
of the last three french hostages in lebanon and the assault 
thursday on melanesian separatists in new caledonia that freed 22 
policemen and a prosecutor 
under french law no polls can be published the week before an 
election so it was impossible to determine how much chirac may 
have gained 
the official campaign ended friday night with the last political 
rallies the final radio and television appeals to frances 383 
million registered voters the law prohibits campaigning on the day 
before an election 
in the first round of the election april 24 mitterrand won 341 
percent of the vote in the field of nine candidates chirac was 
second with 199 percent the last polls published a week ago 
predicted mitterrand would win from 53 to 57 percent of the vote 
speaking before an estimated 50000 people at a final rally 
friday night in the southwestern city of toulouse the president 
said he was waging his ultimate political battle noting that 
he needed more than just socialist votes to win a new term 
we are not sufficiently numerous ourselves he said we 
need frenchmen beyond our ranks to surpass our own borders 
mitterrand flew to the netherlands on saturday to address the 
closing session of the european international movement a private 
organization formed in 1948 to promote the idea of europewide 
cooperation 
chirac in an interview saturday in the rightwing newspaper le 
figaro asked voters to think carefully 
who between mr mitterrand and myself allowed unemployment 
and insecurity to grow he asked who has started to reduce 
them who encouraged clandestine immigration who to the contrary 
put an end to laxism 
he said that when the french compare the results of five years 
of socialist government from 1981 to 1986 and two years of 
centerright government following the conservative victory in the 
1986 legislative elections they will see who has succeeded 
chirac said the incidents in lebanon and new caledonia were not 
timed to coincide with the election he also said the return to 
france of a secret agent who was convicted in new zealand of 
sinking a greenpeace ship was not related to the campaign 
the conditions of the release of the hostages in lebanon 
conformed with honor and dignity without a shadow of a deal with 
terrorist groups without the shadow of reciprocity he said 
nonetheless the events became an element in the last hours of 
the campaign 
france has recovered one by one its children held far from 
here said culture minister francois leotard it would not be 
appropriate if the real author of this french success jacques 
chirac is unrewarded on sunday 
despite the fact that the releases were the work of the chirac 
government mitterrand said he contributed to the success 
there is no distinction between the government and me in such 
a sensitive matter he said 
attention also was focused on what would happen immediately 
after the election results are known sunday night 
for the past two years mitterrand and chirac have been living 
in an uneasy marriage known as cohabitation created when the 
right ousted the socialists from control of the national assembly 
chiracs conservatives still have a majority in the assembly 
whose term does not end until 1991 
if chirac wins the matter is simple he will continue his 
present policies with a government similar to the one now in place 
but mitterrand has the power to dissolve the assembly and call 
new elections but he has said that if he wins he will try to work 
with the present parliament and attempt to form a centerleft 
coalition with wavering centerright deputies 
if that does not succeed he will call new elections 
most analysts believe that the man mitterrand names as his 
premier will depend on his margin of victory two former socialist 
finance ministers pierre beregovoy and jacques delors are 
frequently mentioned as are jeanlouis bianco his chief of staff 
and popular former agriculture minister michel rocard 
if the margin is narrow he could opt for a centrist outside the 
ranks of the socialist party 
the surprising strength of extreme right leader jeanmarie le 
pen who won 144 percent of the firstround vote has increased 
speculation that some centrists who backed chirac would join a 
mitterrand coalition

hundreds of teenagers decked out in colorful gym 
shoes glittering shirts and black leather gloves gyrated to the 
sound of pulsating american rock n roll saturday in beijings 
first breakdance contest 
the twoday competition at the chongwen district culture center 
drew 420 dancers mostly teenage boys 
disco dancing and breakdancing have been critized by chinese 
officials as decadent and dance halls in some cities have been 
closed down only recently have authorities given reluctant 
approval to the dancing 
the government originally took a policy of banning rock music 
and disco but that was not correct said li chunqing an 
official of the culture center if we properly direct the 
enthusiasm for breakdancing it is very healthy 
breakdancing became popular in china last year after the release 
of the american film breakdance 
there have been reports in the official media of youngsters 
skipping school so they can practice their moves 
i hide my breakdancing from my parents said xie maojie 19 
a computer company employee xie wearing a sailor cap large round 
glasses and a thin tie said he had entered the contest just for 
the fun of it 
my parents told me i could breakdance as long as i dont 
become crazy about it said 15yearold lu si a student of opera 
and one of the few girls in the competition 
most of the dancers wore baggy pants and sweatshirts red gym 
shoes with military camouflage pants were a popular combination 
some sported sunglasses glittering shirts leg warmers and black 
gloves 
colored lights flashed from the floor and ceiling of the hall as 
the dancers performed in groups of seven and eight for seven 
judges chen ailian a wellknown classical dancer led the judges 
panel 
the port city of tianjin sponsored what might have been chinas 
first breakdance contest in january and several cities have opened 
breakdance classes to try to channel the dancing craze 
earlier reports said the far north city of harbin had started a 
dozen breakdance classes and that beijing has 10 privately run 
classes the official xinhua news agency said 200 signed up for one 
class of 40 in beijing

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is certain 
to succeed in revamping soviet society but it could take some 
tough years predicts janos kadar who has led communist hungary 
for more than three decades 
kadar in a us television interview being broadcast sunday 
also said there is no internal need for the 64000 soviet soldiers 
still in hungary only international reasons hopefully in the 
coming decade he said relations in europe will develop in such 
a manner that there will be no need for them 
the process of perestroika or restructuring launched by 
gorbachev will be victorious in spite of all the difficulties 
because it means progress for the soviet people and because the 
situation is ripe for it kadar said 
but there are differences over the pace of change and it will 
take years before serious results can be seen some tough 
years said the 75yearold hungarian communist party chief whose 
reputation as an eastern block reformer predates that of gorbachev 
kadar talked in budapest on april 25 with washingtonbased 
journalist john mclaughlin the taped interview was scheduled for 
broadcast on mclaughlins one on one program 
kadar became head of the hungarian socialist workers communist 
party after soviet forces invaded in 1956 to crush a popular 
uprising 
if american forces had intervened in the 1956 upheaval a 
ussoviet clash would have been inevitable kadar said the west 
did not intervene 
i wish that soviet and american troops never meet anywhere as 
enemies in battle he said but as a hungarian i desired least 
of all that they come into conflict on hungarian soil he added 
kadar who in western eyes a villain of the 1956 hungarian 
tragedy gained a new image in the next three decades as a 
dedicated architect of political and economic liberalization aimed 
at improving hungarian life 
today hungary is one of the more prosperous of the soviet bloc 
countries one of the easiest to visit for westerners including 
refugees of 1956 and its citizens have the easiest time leaving 
hungarian reform does not serve as a model for moscow but 
gorbachev admits the kremlin can learn from hungary and soviet 
changes make it easier for us now kadar said 
he acknowledged that the hungarian economy after some dynamic 
growth slowed down and started having serious problems seven or 
eight years ago but said the path continues to be that of 
reform 
on the political side kadar said hungarys rulers recognize 
today that if we cannot convince people about the necessity of 
certain steps it is possible to decree but in reality it 
cannot be carried out 
a western multiparty system cannot be constructed in 
hungary kadar said but in june at the first general party 
conference since 1957 efforts will be made to create socialist 
pluralism reducing party control improving consultation and 
giving more responsibility to nonparty bodies he continued 
the line however will be drawn against anarchy and groups 
working against the system will not be legalized he said

after nursery school on a warm spring day 
jenifer joyces children charged into the house carrying octopus 
characters with dangling arms made of pink construction paper 
the 32yearold woman can relate to lots of arms she deals with 
10 of them every day the arms of her 4yearold quintuplets 
full of afterschool energy christopher kevin lauren megan 
and ryan race to the kitchen to find a box of cheese crackers while 
mrs joyce patiently hangs the windbreakers that were peeled off 
and left in the front hall 
families with five children are not unusual but circumstances 
are different when the five all have the same growing experiences 
at the same time the first tricycle ride the first trip to the 
store 
does mrs joyce really pile all five preschoolers into the 
family van and take them to the supermarket or the mall 
i try everything at least once she said im a great 
believer in that theyre not going to learn how to behave unless 
you try it 
i can sense their moods there are certain days when i start 
out with all five and i end up turning around and coming home 
before i even get there i cant take a chance with them 
especially when im alone 
theyre more tiring now because they have all this energy and 
they feed off each other normal children will die at 8 oclock at 
night and be ready to go to sleep but all of a sudden one sparks 
up and theyre all running around the house wanting to play 
superman 
most of what i do is no different from other people who have 
five kids i dont consider myself a supermom i assume most 
mothers do the same things 
about 40 people turned out to help the joyce family during the 
critical first year the volunteers and a loving husband jerry 
and livein motherinlaw actually enabled mrs joyce to complete 
her college education last year and get a degree in computer 
science 
but instinct has become her strongest talent 
i can spot a glass fall before they even push it or a flying 
pancake even before they throw it she said 
shes doing something right her quintuplets are full of energy 
but wellmannered and respectful and especially obedient to their 
mothers wishes especially when her voice raises 
if theyre really bad i separate them she said 
an example came immediately to hand the three boys got into a 
squirt fight in the bathroom and mrs joyce calmly took 
christopher the unlucky target upstairs to change into clean 
clothes 
mrs joyce said her husband helps a great deal doing the 
laundry every morning before he goes to work as a high school 
teacher 
the worst stage was when the children were born on aug 18 
1983 two months premature and weighing from 1 pound 12 ounces to 
about three pounds mrs joyce had taken a fertility drug often 
associated with multiple births 
nothing was harder than when they were so tiny that you were 
saying your prayers every day she said 
now mrs joyce gets some relief while the quints go to nursery 
school but she tries to keep one or two home every day for some 
time alone on a recent day christopher was allowed to play with a 
toy that had many small parts a toy that gets packed away when 
the children are together 
when i have just one home like this they talk nonstop 
mrs joyce said that oneonone is important 
despite the push for individuality mrs joyce does dress the 
quintuplets alike sometimes if only for safety reasons if its 
a crowded place you can spot them in a minute and they can spot 
each other 
mothers day will be like any other day she said tending to 
the needs of the quintuplets 
the quints do draw attention mrs joyce said but thats not 
a problem most people love children and its usually a very 
amiable response 
i dont mind sharing the joy we were blessed and the 
children are healthy and happy

a poster of vladimir i lenin peers 
out from behind heaps of dusty rubble onto a main street choked 
with thousands of afghan army uniforms 
the greenandwhite flag of the moslem resistance hung atop the 
old local headquarters of the soviet army flaps in the mountain 
wind 
below moslem insurgents pick through the remains of their 
prize the former sovietafghan garrison of barikot 
on april 20 anticommunist guerrillas launched a furious rocket 
and grenade attack on this strategic post about a mile west of the 
pakistan border 
the town soon fell but not before soviet and afghan forces fled 
in a series of helicopter airlifts 
barikot was the first of at least six outposts in eastern 
afghanistan that have fallen to the guerrillas since the soviets 
began pulling away from the region in preparation for their 
withdrawal from afghanistan set to begin may 15 
it also opened an important new supply route in the insurgents 
fight to oust the communist government in kabul 
the fall of barikot opens the transportation route to the 
provinces of badakshan kunduz baghlan laghman and parwan said 
commander lalgul of the hezbiislami yunis khalis faction 
those afghanistan provinces lie to the east north and west of 
kabul and include the main route which the soviets are expected to 
take as they head home to the soviet union 
the soviet army entered afghaninstan eight years ago to replace 
one communist administration with another and fight afghan 
guerrillas who opposed the sovietbacked government in kabul 
on april 14 the soviet union agreed to withdraw its estimated 
115000 troops from afghanistan under a plan it signed in geneva 
with pakistan afghanistan and the united states the guerrillas do 
not recognize the agreement and have vowed to keep fighting until 
they smash the kabul government 
the victory at barikot did much for their cause 
about 60 percent of this sunbaked town was destroyed in massive 
sovietafghan bombings following the evacuation 
but plenty remains huge stashes of arms artillery ammunition 
armored and conventional military vehicles and deadly booby traps 
guerrillas say as many as 10 returning afghan refugees were 
killed by land mines as they returned to the garrison town from 
pakistan 
but as the death toll mounted guerrillas pushed the refugees 
back across the precarious woodplank suspension bridge that spans 
the kunar river to pakistan and only guerrillas were allowed near 
the town 
traveling on narrow footpaths the insurgents keep their eyes on 
the ground searching for booby traps and mines 
in the grassy rockstrewn fields around barikot remnants of 
helicopters rust in the sun the guerrillas say they were downed 
with ussupplied stinger antiaircraft missiles 
commander shahafullah is the stinger commander he shot down a 
soviet mig27 boasted zahir khan a member of the khalis 
faction 
lalgul said an old man left behind in the village told him many 
villagers were forced to board waiting helicopters at gunpoint 
when the army served notice that every man woman and child 
would be flown out of barikot lalgul said the old man told him 
women kissed the wall and asked why do we want to go 
the commander said afghan militia and army officers were taken 
to mazaresharif about 45 miles south of the soviet border in 
order to fortify the north 
he did not elaborate 
guerrillas and western diplomats have said they believe the 
soviets and afghanistans marxist leaders will create a security 
zone in the north in case kabul falls some have even suggested 
that the soviets want to create a communist zone in the north 
despite fears that the seven main guerrilla factions would begin 
fighting each other once they defeat the communists the flags of 
four insurgent groups fly in barikot 
while members of khalis party show off some heavy artillery 
fighters of gulbaddin hekmatyars hezbiislami crowd into an 
abandoned truck to pose for pictures 
on the road into town khalis commanders stop to greet 
guerriilas of burhanuddin rabbanis jamiatiislami 
on the outskirts zahir khan points out the office of abdul 
sayyafs ittihadiislami 
he dismissed charges that the guerrillas will turn their weapons 
on each other 
we are all brothers like one hand he said

siamese twin girls who were 
joined at the head until an operation four days ago are out of 
intensive care and recovering well hospital officials said 
saturday 
mpho and mphonyana mathibela aged 17 months were separated in 
a 7hour operation tuesday by a 40member medical team at 
baragwanath hospital in a black township outside johannesburg 
mphonyana the smaller and weaker of the two required brief 
followup surgery wednesday her condition has since improved 
steadily and she was taken from the intensive care ward friday to 
join her sister in the neurosurgical ward hospital officials said 
mpho has been eating solid food and taking milk from a bottle 
they said 
doctors said that if all goes well the girls will need only one 
more operation sometime before they reach age 6 
baragwanath doctors said they took a different approach to 
separating the girls than a medical team used at johns hopkins 
university in baltimore 
in september the johns hopkins doctors separated west german 
siamese twins also joined at the head in a 22hour operation since 
then benjamin and patrick binder have required a dozen followup 
operations 
both survived and returned to west germany last month 
the baragwanath team led by dr robert lipschitz instead 
performed two preliminary operations in october on the mathibela 
twins they partially clamped a shared blood vein in hopes that 
smaller vessels would take over in each child 
the preliminary operations allowed the baragwanath doctors to 
separate the girls in a shorter final operation 
we could have used the same technique they did but decided to 
do diametrically the opposite because of the problems they hit 
lipschitz said 
sophie mathibela the mother of the twins is a 33yearold 
unmarried domestic worker who earns about 60 a month she was 
asked to make a 5 contribution to the costs of the operations 
estimated at 700000 
the costs are being covered by the hospital and the university 
of the witwatersrand medical school

catoctin mountains of maryland 
it is my hope that in recognition of the important role they 
play in this process the 100 members of the united states senate 
will now proceed expeditiously in their debate he said senate 
appoval of the treaty will enable us to get on with the job of 
eliminating these nuclear missiles 
reviewing the history of the pact the president said we held 
fast to what we wanted and we got it and this is what comes from 
negoitiating from strength its the same successful formula 
dealing from strength that were applying to our other 
negotiations with the soviet union as well 
i can assure you if we dont get what we want in these other 
areas if we dont get good treaties there will be no treaties 
he said 
now that the treaty is moving to floor debate in the senate

chirac and use the proceeds for a minumum guaranteed income

caledonia and the popular return of a french spy from exile in the

the nationalist kanaks never wanted to kill the hostages they 
had all the means they had all the time to do so had they wished

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address delivered saturday from camp david md 
my fellow americans next week the full united states senate is 
expected to begin floor debate on the treaty on intermediaterange 
nuclear forces known as the inf treaty youll recall that soviet 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev and i signed this treaty 
at our summit meeting in washington last december the treaty 
represents a landmark accomplishment an historic accomplishment 
because once implemented it will bring about the elimination of an 
entire class of american and soviet nuclear missiles 
before our nation can commit itself to a treaty our 
constitution provides that the senate must give its advice and 
consent and therefore last january i formally submitted the inf 
treaty to the senate for its consideration the duty of the senate 
in giving its advice and consent to treaties is vital to 
maintaining our separation of powers and the role of the senate in 
considering the inf treaty is essential 
senior officials of the administration have been working closely 
with the senate officials from our state and defense departments 
our intelligence community and our arms control agency have 
provided many hours of testimony before three separate senate 
committees painstakingly responding to the detailed questions 
posed to them by the senators on these committees 
in addition senators have addressed to the administration 
numerous letters about the treaty and more than 1200 written 
questions we have provided full written responses so youll see 
that weve worked very hard to meet any senate concerns over the 
treaty and as ive assured the senate well continue to do so 
now that the senate foreign relations committee has approved the 
inf treaty the entire senate will be called on to discharge its 
constitutional responsibility to provide its advice and consent to 
the inf treaty as this debate is about to begin in the historic 
senate chamber permit me to take a moment to review you through 
the treatys background 
the inf treaty is the result of years of hard work by american 
officials officials who in representing you in our negotiations 
with the soviet union held fast to the key security objectives 
that had been set out for the united states and our nato allies at 
one point the soviet union actually walked away from the table and 
stayed away from the talks for almost a year and a half 
when in early 1985 the soviets finally returned we repeated our 
call for the elimination of this entire class of us and soviet 
missiles my zero option proposal first put forward all the way 
back in 1981 and in 1987 it was the soviet union that finally 
after two and a half more years of negotiating came around to the 
american position 
to sum up in the inf negotiations we held fast to what we 
wanted and we got it and this is what comes when negotiating from 
strength its the same successful formula dealing from strength 
that were applying to our other negotiations with the soviet union 
as well and i assure you if we dont get what we want in these 
other areas in other words if we do not get good treaties 
there will be no treaties 
its my hope that in recognition of the important role they play 
in this process the 100 members of the united states senate will 
now proceed expeditiously in their debate on the inf treaty it is 
after all a solid treaty carefully negotiated a treaty that 
stands on its own substantive merits a treaty that will enhance 
the security of our country and that of our european and asian 
allies now threatened by the various soviet missiles that will be 
removed once the treaty is implemented 
senate approval of the treaty will enable us to get on with the 
job of eliminating these nuclear missiles it will also allow us to 
put into action the elaborate verification regime that we achieved 
in the inf treaty the most stringent in arms control history it 
will enable us to verify effectively that the soviets are indeed 
complying with all of the treatys provisions 
i know that you the american people strongly support this inf 
treaty and on capitol hill the house of representatives has 
already given the treaty its endorsement by an overwhelming vote of 
393 to 7 now that the treaty is moving to floor debate in the 
senate let the debate be vigorous and full and let it proceed 
without delay for im confident that the final vote will indeed 
give advice and consent to this historic treaty the historic step 
toward a safer peace 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

if the 120yearold west virginia 
penitentiary is ever put up for sale the hare krishna community 
might want to buy it raze it and then raise elephants the sects 
newsletter says 
the krishnas also could use the prison kitchen to feed the 
homeless and take blocks from its sandstone walls for new 
buildings according to the april issue of new vrindaban worldwide 
the state supreme court has found conditions at the prison 
unconstitutional and appointed a special master to make periodic 
reports one of the special masters suggestions was that the 
prison be sold and another one built 
the prison was the scene of a new years day 1986 riot in which 
three convicts were killed three other inmates also were killed 
later during 1986 
if the penitentiary did go up for sale what do the devotees 
propose to do with it well it has a modern kitchen it could be 
turned into a center for the homeless to expand our food for life 
program said the krishna newsletter portions of which appeared 
in the moundsville daily echo last week 
maybe well tear down the walls to use for building keep the 
kitchen for the homeless and use the land for an elephant reserve 
if you have any ideas wed be glad to hear them how about the 
moundsville castle of understanding 
the krishnas are based in nearby new vrindaban the newspaper 
noted that their presence has caused some distress among other 
marshall county residents and a sale of the prison might draw 
opposition from those who oppose expanded krishna holdings

the first flight of the soviet unions space 
shuttle which officials previously have said would be unmanned 
probably will carry two crew members the official tass news agency 
said saturday 
the soviet reusable spaceship will probably be carrying two 
persons on its maiden flight just as the us space shuttle did on 
its test mission tass quoted vladimir shatalov chief of 
cosmonaut training as saying 
on march 18 alexander dunayev head of the soviet space agency 
glavkosmos told a news conference that scientists were working 
around the clock to prepare for the first launch of the space 
shuttle before june 
he said at the time that the initial flight would be unmanned 
and implied that the soviet union was more concerned about the 
safety of its space crews than the united states 
we pursue the fundamental objective whether man is alive or 
dead after the flight on the basis of that we regard the 
fundamental differences between the soviet direction of development 
and the us part of development he said 
the us space shuttle program was grounded after the explosion 
of the space shuttle challenger in january 1986 that killed all 
seven crewmembers 
western experts say the soviets also have lost crews on space 
missions and in training the soviet space effort traditionally has 
been shrouded in secrecy and little information has been released 
tass quoted shatalov as saying the shape of the soviet space 
shuttle is similar to that of the us craft since both must 
perform like a supersonic airplane when returning to earth 
but shatalov was quoted as saying that while the united states 
has a booster rocket specifically designed to launch its shuttle 
the soviets are launching theirs with the more powerful energia 
booster which also can be used to send other payloads into space 
tass did not say when the shuttle would be launched

rival shiite moslem militias fought 
fierce street battles saturday for control of south beiruts slums 
where extremists are believed to hold most of the 18 foreign 
hostages 
police said 51 people were killed and 70 wounded 
using tanks howitzers and mortars prosyrian amal militia 
squads battled bands from the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of 
god for the second day they also made grenadethrowing forays 
into each others territory police said 
ambulances evacuated some casualties as the thud of exploding 
shells echoed across beirut thick smoke billowed from burning 
apartment blocks in several parts of the densely populated district 
but the intensity of the battle in the labyrinthine slums a 
traditional hezbollah stronghold prevented lebanese red cross and 
civil defense teams from evacuating many of the wounded who lay 
bleeding on the streets 
saturdays victims raised the casualty toll to 67 killed and 120 
injured the violence began before dawn friday and appeared part of 
an amal drive to crush its main rival 
hospitals packed with wounded issued urgent appeals for blood 
civilians caught in the cross fire who have huddled in 
basements and bomb shelters since friday tried to flee when food 
and water began running out 
syrian soldiers deployed in neighboring west beirut in february 
last year to end three years of anarchy watched from sandbagged 
positions as refugees scampered from their undergound hiding places 
reporters saw a dozen women children and old men carrying 
mattresses and clothes duck sniper fire to dart across the main 
street in the ghobeiri neighborhood to safety 
weve been in the basement since before dawn friday said 
azzam abdallah as he shepherded his twin daughters and wife ilham 
all clad in nightgowns into the syrian position on the western 
edge of the battle zone 
we ran out of food we ran out of milk for the children 
said adballah who works as a taxi driver at beirut airport 
abdallahs 7yearold daughters joumana and zaynab were too 
scared to say anything they rushed into a black mercedes stopped 
by a syrian soldier who ordered the driver to take the family to 
any safe area 
a police spokesman said amal gunners pounded intersections 
linking the neighborhoods of haret heik bir elabed and hay madi 
hezbollahs three main strongholds to try to block hezbollahs 
supply lines 
the ferocity of the fighting forced the senior shiite cleric in 
lebanon sheik mmohammed mahdi shamseddine to evacuate his 
residence in haret hreik police said 
the fighting raged despite ceasefire calls from shamseddine and 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah hezbollahs reputed spiritual 
guide 
my sons i call upon you to stop this war in which there is no 
victor fadlallah said in an appeal broadcast throughout south 
beirut over loudspeaker systems in mosques 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for shiite 
factions holding foreign hostages in lebanon and many of those 
released in the past three years have said they were held in south 
beirut at one time or another there was no word as to whether the 
latest fighting endangered the captives 
syria the main power broker in lebanon sent 7500 troops into 
moslem west beirut on feb 22 1987 in a bid to end three years of 
war 
but the syrians have not moved into the shiite stronghold of 
south beirut apparently to avoid a headon collision with irans 
allies 
the amalhezbollah clashes were the heaviest between the two 
sides since amal cracked down on hezbollah forces last month 
sixtytwo people were killed and 150 wounded in that fourday 
confrontation in south lebanon 
the latest confrontation began friday when four amal militiamen 
were killed in an ambush in south beirut amal blamed hezbollah for 
the deaths 
police said incendiary shells scored direct hits on several 
apartments in south beirut starting dozens of fires firefighters 
could not approach because of the violence 
police said most of the estimated 250000 residents of south 
beirut spent the night in basements and bomb shelters as gunmen 
fought it out in the narrow alleys 
machine gun fire blocked the main highway leading to beirut 
international airport on the southwestern edge of the disputed 
region however passengers managed to reach the facility through 
side streets and flight schedules were not affected police said 
also in beirut us state department emissary april glaspie 
briefed lebanons moslem leaders on efforts exerted by the reagan 
administration to end the lebanese crisis 
we as americans are always hopeful we can do something to 
assist all the lebanese to put an end to their tragedy glaspie 
told reporters after meeting with sunni moslem acting prime 
minister salim hoss 
in south lebanon two israelibacked militiamen were killed 
saturday when a roadside bomb exploded knocking out their armored 
personnel carrier un sources said 
they said gunners of the israelibacked south lebanon army 
militia responded by shelling three nearby villages but a casualty

ecuadorean voters on sunday choose between 
two leftleaning candidates to replace conservative president leon 
febres cordero washingtons closest ally in south america 
the election pits rodrigo borja a law professor and leader of 
the democratic left party against abdala bucaram a fiery 
foulmouthed campaigner from the tough port city of guayaquil 
borja and bucaram leader of the populist roldosista party 
qualified for the presidential runoff by coming in first and second 
respectively in a field of 10 candidates in jan 31 elections 
borja received 20 percent of the vote to bucarams 15 percent 
newspapers have criticized the candidates for conducting a 
campaign of personal insults rather than debating the issues and 
campaign violence has left three men dead and more than a dozen 
wounded in clashes between armed bands of supporters 
for the love of god stop insulting one another monsignor 
bernardino echeverria a roman catholic leader said in an appeal 
to bucaram and borja 
bucaram the 36yearold heir to a political dynasty of lebanese 
immigrants who settled in guayaquil set the tone for the campaign 
by calling his foe a drunkard drug addict and atheist he also 
used street language to question borjas virility 
borja a 52yearold urbane politician from quito the highland 
capital responded with insults of his own he has accused bucaram 
of having a whorehouse vocabulary and being a fascist 
ignoramus 
borjas party which espouses a social democratic ideology is 
the countrys largest and he is favored to win in most public 
opinion polls but political analysts say bucaram cannot be counted 
out noting that 25 percent of the voters were still undecided in 
the final week of the campaign 
borja has pledged to reverse febres corderos freemarket 
economic policies and seek close ties to the nonaligned movement 
bucaram couching his campaign in appeals to the countrys 
millions of poor has vowed to raise taxes on the rich and punish 
the oligarchy he has promised to provide free shoes to all poor 
children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum wage 
to 55 
bucaram is a former mayor of guayaquil who gained a huge 
following among slum dwellers by paving streets and providing 
drinking water and other essential services to shantytowns 
a vote for me is the same as throwing excrement in the face of 
the oligarchy he said throughout his campaign 
his opponents have accused him of making demagogic inflammatory 
appeals to the poor and strong rumors have circulated for months 
that he will be ousted in a military coup if elected 
this coloradosized nation of 10 million people returned to 
democratic rule in 1979 after a decade of civilian and military 
dictatorships 
febres cordero whose fouryear term ends in august has had a 
stormy relationship with the leftist and populist parties that 
controlled congress he had to put down a rebellion by an air force 
commander halfway through his presidency 
the candidate of his social christian party fared poorly in the 
january elections coming in third the poor showing was viewed as 
a sign of the low popularity of the government 
the economy shrank in 1987 by 35 percent and inflation is 
expected to climb to at least 50 percent this year the highest 
level since 1983 
febres corderos supporters blame the decline on the sharp drop 
in the price of oil ecuadors main source of income and economic 
damage from a devastating earthquake in march 1987

a trade bill veto would play into the hands of 
foreign governments who conducted massive lobbying against the 
measure a democratic lawmaker said saturday in response to 
president reagans weekly radio address 
sen donald riegle dmich said the bill would stop trade 
cheating by foreign nations and urged reagan to sign the 
legislation 
reagan has said he plans to veto the bill because of a plant 
closing notification provision 
the bill would overhaul the nations system for imposing import 
curbs to retaliate against international trade violations and aid 
american industries threatened by steppedup foreign competition 
supporters say the revised rules would force other nations 
particularly japan korea and taiwan to open their markets to us 
goods 
every citizen should urge president reagan to sign the trade 
bill said riegle an author of some of the bills provisions 
he cited an estimate by the new york federal reserve board that 
the united states within three years will owe the rest of the world 
1 trillion and noted that the trade deficit was building each 
year 
we must reverse the trade deficit now we must stop this 
massive debt accumulation and keep our jobs and our money from 
hemorrhaging overseas he said 
riegle urged reagan to reject the massive lobbying power of 
foreign governments and companies who have gotten rich on unfair 
trade and who worked day and night to kill this trade bill 
many nations will not let us products be sold in their 
countries yes they sell to us but they refuse to buy from us 
riegle said 
he cited the failure last week of negotiations between the 
united states and japan over japanese restrictions on imports of 
beef and oranges 
just this week they said no again to us beef and citrus 
products thats wrong and it must be changed riegle said 
riegle said the trade crisis threatens every job in america 
he said the plantclosing provision that prompted reagans veto 
promise is necessary to help workers prepare for the shock of a 
major job loss 
the provision would require all but the smallest employers to 
provide 60day notice of closings and largescale layoffs the 
administration opposes the provision saying it would cramp us 
economic growth and encourage companies to locate elsewhere by 
adding new federal regulation

rep floyd spence rsc should fully 
recover from saturdays rare doublelung transplant before 
november when voters have to decide whether to give him a 10th 
term in office his doctor said 
i think the congressman has tremendous spirit he wants to do 
things i suspect his recovery period should be very short said 
the leader of the university of mississippi medical center 
transplant team dr seshadri raju 
raju said the 60yearold spence was on a respirator in critical 
but stable condition after five hours of surgery concluded about 3 
am saturday 
spence suffered from chronic obstructive lung disease a 
hereditary and debilitating illness that doctors say would have 
taken his life without the transplant 
if everything goes satisfactorily i think he will be 
recovered much much earlier than that november raju said the 
congressman should be able to take calls from his bed within a 
week a two im sure maybe sooner 
prior to the surgery raju had said spence would be able to 
resume a normal schedule within six months with surprisingly 
little in the way of physical restrictions

here is the text of the democratic response 
saturday to president reagans weekly radio address 
this is senator don riegle from michigan if you work for a 
living or have children or other family members who work for a 
living then you have a vital stake in the trade bill just passed 
by congress 
america today faces a trade crisis that trade crisis threatens 
every job in america theres an urgent need to change our trade 
laws in order to save and create american jobs 
congress has passed a strong trade bill that will strengthen 
america and stop other nations from cheating us in world trade we 
need this law and every citizen should urge president reagan to 
sign the trade bill 
listen to these figures our trade deficit as a nation is 
running at the rate of 166 billion a year the most recent monthly 
trade deficit was so bad it knocked the stock market down over 100 
points in a single day we have become the largest debtor nation 
and are adding new international debt at the rate of 1 billion 
every two and a half days thats right 1 billion of new foreign 
debt every two and a half days this poses great dangers to our 
future 
the new york federal reserve board says that within three years 
we will owe the rest of the world 1 trillion a trillion dollars 
is a thousand billion its incredible 
we must reverse the trade deficit now we must stop this massive 
debt accumulation and keep our jobs and our money from 
hemorrhagging overseas 
now heres what the trade bill will do first it will stop 
trade cheating by foreign nations many nations will not let us 
products be sold in their countries they sell to us but refuse 
to buy from us japan alone is running a 60 billion trade surplus 
with the united states and draining 5 billion of capital a month 
from our economic system 
yet japan will not allow many us products to be sold in japan 
just this week they said no again to us beef and citrus 
products thats wrong and it must be changed 
this trade bill requires fair open twoway trade we must 
insist on fair trade if were going to preserve americas 
economic strength and our leadership in the world 
the trade bill also provides needed help and retraining for us 
workers who lose their jobs because of the trade invasion now that 
makes good sense no american worker should be thrown on the scrap 
heap we should help every citizen remain productive and 
selfsufficient it is a responsibility we have to each other 
another key provision of the trade bill requires 60 days advance 
notice when large plant closings or layoffs are going to take 
place thats only fair workers and communities need this advance 
warning to prepare for the shock of a major job loss maybe a way 
can be found to prevent the closing 
companies that cannot foresee the closing ahead of time are 
exempt from this new law advance notice makes good sense 
management workers and communities should share this information 
for the good of all we must care about each other and really 
work as a team if were going to increase productivity lift our 
living standard and fight off foreign competition if management 
knows ahead of time that a plant will close why shouldnt workers 
and the community 
overall then the trade bill insists on fair trading rules and 
helps our country adjust to the tough new demands of world 
competition 
mr president we urge you to listen to the american people and 
to the large bipartisan majority in congress that wrote this vital 
trade bill our economic future is at stake 
we ask you to sign the bill lets give america the tools it 
needs to sell overseas and stop the massive mortgage of foreign 
debt being strapped on every person in america lets act while 
theres still time 
we ask you to stand up for our country to stand up for trade 
fairness to stand up for the job future of every young person in 
america we can win if the trade rules are fair 
we ask you to reject the massive lobbying power of foreign 
governments and companies who have gotten rich on unfair trade 
and who are working day and night to kill this trade bill with a 
presidential veto 
mr president sign the trade bill into law and give us all the 
chance to build a strong economic future the oldfashioned american 
way top notch individual effort teamwork and fair rules american 
can win if we have a fair chance

the state departments no 2 officer on 
saturday denounced polands crackdown on strikers and said us 
backing for that governments economic recovery plan will remain 
frozen until the program wins popular support 
we have to condemn the violence imprisonments the beatings 
that are reported to be taking place deputy secretary of state 
john c whitehead said the situation there is very sad 
whitehead also said that during a trip to algeria this week he 
will urge leaders to see that the hijackers of a kuwaiti airliner 
who might still be in algeria are brought to justice 
us officials disclosed earlier last week that us support for 
polands economic programs would flag unless the polish government 
resumes a dialogue with labor groups but in an interview with 
three reporters whitehead defined the us position with greater 
detail and clarity 
since lifting sanctions in 1986 the united states has been 
cautiously encouraging economic recovery in poland and has pledged 
to support warsaws plea for assistance from international 
financial institutions 
whitehead said the polish program which includes wage and 
price austerity would never be effective without popular support 
he said that must be achieved through consultations with workers 
notably the solidarity free trade movement that is leading the 
current strikes 
we are urging the government to establish a dialogue with the 
workers of poland including members of solidarity to create an 
enthusiasm for the program he said 
we believe until that happens that the economic program of the 
government which strikes us as being a basically sensible program 
will not be able to become effective he said as a result the 
ability of the united states to support that program will be 
ruined 
he said the united states had been planning to back polands 
applications for loans from the world bank and to work with the 
socalled paris club of lender nations to restructure polands 
massive foreign debt 
there also is a possibility of direct us assistance whitehead 
said 
but all of those things are now in jeopardy because of the 
lack of a kind of national reconciliation whitehead said 
asked why poland acted so strenuously against the strikers 
knowing the united states would react strongly whitehead said 
the polish government evidently feels that it can impose an 
economic program on the country without any kind of participation 
of the people in developing the program 
we have felt all along it is not possible to do it that way 
and now the evidence begins to appear that it is not possible he 
said 
whiteheads visit to poland last year was the highestranking 
state department mission to that country since the martial law 
crackdown against solidarity in 1981 and he has been to other 
eastern european countries as the reagan administration official 
with special responsibility for relations with the soviet bloc 
nations 
during his visits he has told leaders that improved performance 
on human rights and moves toward freer economic life will lead to 
the closer commercial ties they have been seeking with the united 
states 
whitehead is scheduled on monday to begin a 12day trip to 
morocco tunisia algeria and france 
in algeria he said he would seek more information from the 
government on its role in the ending of last months kuwaiti air 
lines hijacking the plane captured by gunmen seeking the release 
of shiite moslems imprisoned on terrorism charges in kuwait ended 
up in algiers where authorities talked the hijackers into freeing 
the passengers 
there have been unconfirmed published reports that the hijackers 
are still in algeria but whitehead said we dont know for sure 
he repeated us pleas to algeria and any other country where 
the hijackers might be to arrest them 
we will set forth our views strongly that hijackers should 
not be allowed to get away with their criminal acts and must be 
brought to justice whitehead said

a pan american boeing 737 airliner 
made a precautionary landing at long beach airport on saturday 
because smoke entered the cabin shortly after it took off from los 
angeles international airport officials said 
flight 280 to san diego with 34 passengers and crew aboard 
landed safely at 738 am said alan loflin a pan am spokesman in 
dallas 
there were no injuries and no damage to the plane loflin said 
a small amount of smoke in the cabin was determined to come from 
the ventilation system and was likely caused by some detergent that 
may have gotten into a fan motor when the plane was cleaned friday 
loflin said 
there was a presence of smoke in the cabin it was definitely 
not a smokefilled cabin loflin said 
the plane was scheduled to resume its flight to san diego he 
said 
a federal aviation administration duty officer described the 
landing as precautionary rather than an emergency loflin said 
there was no emergency evacuation of the jet

the tailors of savile row britains worldfamous 
custom tailoring district took to the street with their needles 
thread and scissors saturday for a fitting centennial celebration 
to kick off events marking the federation of merchant tailors 
100th anniversary a team of 20 cutters tailors and finishers 
assembled a gray striped woolen suit in just nine hours 
the cornerstone of a gentlemans wardrobe normally would take 
eight weeks to complete require one or two fittings and cost 
1400 to 2250 said federation president robert bright 
im taking the opportunity of the centenary to remove the 
metaphoric frosted windows and curtained windows that were a 
feature of tailor shops for far too long said bright also 
chairman of the 159yearold wells of mayfair firm 
savile row a short narrow street in central london was sealed 
off to traffic and tents were erected where passersby could watch 
the 90 separate steps involved in fashioning a threepiece suit 
the marathon pinning basting and sewing session began at 9 am 
with the cutting of the fabric and the last button was in place by 
612 pm 
martyn lewis a british broadcasting corp tv anchorman with a 
34inch waist and 41inch chest was the guinea pig he requested 
only that the garment be made for sitting down in so he could 
read the news without any inelegant wrinkling of the lapel of his 
bespoke suit a term derived from customers bespeaking 
their individual requirements 
one of the aspects of a bespoke suit is that it is only right 
for the person for whom its made bright said adding that lewis 
was getting the suit for free the whole styling and the cutting 
needs to embrace his personality and coloring as well as his 
figuration 
savile row has been synonymous with conservative mens fashions 
since the mid1800s when henry poole and co opened its back door 
onto the street 
other tailors followed and the influx of tradesmen so upset 
wealthy doctors living in the fashionable residential neighborhood 
that they fled to harley street 
now savile row is threatened by new planning laws bright said 
until last summer light industry and offices were separate 
planning categories and permission was required to change from one 
to the other both now fall into a new general business category 
the government said it was trying to revitalize inner cities by 
loosening planning laws but bright said that means tailors 
workshops in savile row and adjoining soho can be redeveloped into 
more lucrative office space without official permission 
he expects rents to quadruple followed by tax increases some 
landlords already are asking about 95 a square foot he said 
it is an enormous threat there is no way the french would 
just pass up their haute couture industry and yet this government 
is quite prepared to write off the top of the british clothing 
industry as if it didnt matter 
bright said its difficult to find words to describe the 
pleasures of bespoke tailoring 
its an experience it is a feeling of confidence that you 
know that you are projecting just the image that you want to 
project the part of your personality that you want to speak we 
are in fact creating a portrait in cloth he said 
with a readymade suit you have to conform not only to a given 
set of measures but also to what the designer wants you to look 
like when he hasnt even seen you bright said 
a bespoke suit should last a decade providing it hangs in the 
closet for six days between wearings so the wool can recover its 
bounce hence the advice that a proper english gentleman owns 
seven suits one for each day of the week 
bright said savile row does 48 million annual business 
including 32 million overseas 
anderson and sheppard are known as the royal tailors although 
several windows on the row prominently display royal warrants 
proving they do business with buckingham palace 
pooles received it first royal warrant from napoleon and later 
outfitted ethiopias emperor haile selassie 
huntsman and sons which keeps saddles in each of its five 
fitting rooms made riding breeches for king edward viii who 
abdicated to marry the american wallis simpson

the idea of plunking down money for the 
privilege of quaffing some ritzy imported bubbly stuff water 
that is apparently doesnt go over as well in georgia as it does 
in california 
owners of a water bar restaurant decided to close down after 
demand for their nonalcoholic healthrelated beverages dried up 
club soda opened in this atlanta suburb in october as an 
alternative to atlantas innumerable bars and nightclubs in 
addition to a regular menu and alcoholic drinks it offered as many 
as 75 kinds of water and seltzer for up to 6 for a large bottle of 
the deluxe stuff 
but it didnt catch on said owner jim killeen despite the 
success of similar establishments in california 
we felt it was strong enough to warrant investing a 
halfmillion dollars into the concept killeen said but it 
never materialized people just werent interested in coming into 
that type of establishment for healthrelated beverages

the sandinista government faces 
increasing economic and social pressures as talks drag on to work 
out a lasting peace in its almost 7yearold war with usbacked 
rebels 
ceasefire talks under a march 23 agreement with the contra 
rebels remained snagged on security issues with deep mistrust on 
both sides a fragile temporary truce was generally holding but 
the future remained uncertain 
seven weeks after historic meetings in the border town of sapoa 
brought an unexpected hope of peace deep differences still divide 
the two sides two more rounds of talks in managua have left them 
without even an agreement on where and when to continue 
negotiations 
meanwhile internal problems grew for the leftist government 
last week with a hunger strike by more than 30 workers demanding 
higher wages the workers ended their 10day fast in managua after 
the government agreed to begin salary negotiations on monday union 
leaders said 
the construction workers and car mechanics held their hunger 
strike at the socialist general workers federation headquarters 
while they were holed up inside sandinista special forces police 
broke up demonstrations outside with rubber truncheons and detained 
more than 70 supporters 
the sandinistas also barred civilian movement around the union 
hall detained nicaraguans without charge and suspended several 
radio news shows accused of broadcasting false information about 
the strike 
it was the most blatant show of government repression since a 
regional peace plan was signed aug 7 by the presidents of 
nicaragua el salvador costa rica guatemala and honduras the 
plan to end fighting in nicaragua el salvador and guatemala also 
called for democratic reforms 
the governments handling of the hunger strike stood in sharp 
contrast to its openly conciliatory statements toward the contras 
and prompted criticism from both rightists and far leftists 
talk with the workers not with contras said a poster from 
the marxistleninist popular action movement 
erick ramirez president of the social christian party charged 
the government with restricting liberties without using the laws 
the hunger strikers joined workers claiming to number 4500 
who walked off their jobs feb 25 to demand more pay and protest 
economic measures enacted feb 15 
the steps designed to end the black market and cut inflation 
included issuing a new currency and setting new wage scales and 
price structures inflation is officially placed at an annual rate 
of 1800 percent unofficially at 7000 percent 
the sandinistas say the war with the rebels has caused more than 
3 billion in damage 
prices set by the government in february jumped in the open 
markets because staterun supermarket shelves were bare as usual 
black marketeers also returned the official rate of the cordoba 
is 11 for 1 yet the illegal market puts the exchange at 85 to 1 
according to the sandinistas the price of a pound of rice is 4 
cordobas but it sells for 25 cooking oil scarce for years sells 
for 100 cordobas instead of the governmentmandated 12 
the soviet bloc continues to help with more than 500 million in 
economic aid yearly the total of east bloc military aid is a state 
secret 
the united states cut off all aid to nicaragua in 1981 
president reagan recently renewed us trade sanctions in effect 
since 1985 
the us embassy said the effect of the sanctions has been to 
increase nicaraguas costs of trade although alternative markets 
have been found for everything the country can produce and many 
usmade goods are still obtainable at higher prices 
to further bolster the crippled economy the government began 
cutbacks that will eliminate 20000 state jobs mostly among lower 
level staunch sandinista supporters 
the economic difficulties are of such a magnitude that we 
dont have any alternative interior minister tomas borge said 
recently we have to put these people into the production 
sector 
thousands of rural peasants who would otherwise be sowing crops 
have fled to the capital where a third of the countrys population 
of 3 million lives to escape fighting 
the battles started in november 1981 less than a 1 years after 
the sandinistas came to power in a revolutionary war that overthrew 
the distatorship of late president anastasio somoza 
the general mood is the government doesnt know what to do and 
the economic situation doesnt have any way out until there is 
peace and a new acceptable government said ramiro gurdian vice 
president of the antigovernment private enterprise council 
the 60day ceasefire signed in sapoa and begun april 1 had 
largely held until this past week when two violations were 
reported 
sandinista army troops said rebels attacked government soldiers 
140 miles southeast of managua on thursday wounding four the 
defense ministry also said contras based at a honduran naval base 
in the gulf of fonseca used speedboats to raid a government 
military position on wednesday 
a commander for the indian rebel group yatama in the caribbean 
coast region said government troops recently attacked rebel 
positions 270 miles northeast of managua

a rare exhibition of american impressionist 
painter childe hassams flag pictures explodes into view sunday at 
the national gallery of art with all the brilliant optimism of a 
fourth of july fireworks display 
it is the first time since 1922 before the artists death that 
his patriotic canvases from world war i have been drawn from widely 
scattered public museums and private collections and shown 
together the lenders include ibm frank sinatra and the white 
house 
hassam the most important american impressionist at the turn of 
the century was enthralled by the majesty and symbolic power of 
the us and allied flags banners and bunting that festooned new 
york city streets mostly along fifth avenue for wartime parades 
and fundraising rallies 
his 31 flag pictures painted from 1916 until the war ended in 
1919 are preeminent examples of how art could serve 
patriotism says ilene susan fort associate curator of american 
art at the los angeles county museum of art which organized the 
exhibition 
hassams flags frequently are framed by manhattan churches and 
skyscrapers as symbols of the moral force of the allied cause and 
americas emergence as a world power she said 
the national gallery exhibition includes 23 of the flag 
paintings which were sold individually after 1922 after failure of 
a plan to purchase a group of them as a war memorial for new york 
city 
ms fort said five of the flag paintings sold in the 1920s 
including three depicting women watching parades from flagdraped 
windows have since vanished and their whereabouts if they still 
exist are unknown she said she hoped that word of the exhibition 
might encourage the owners to step forward 
when the show closes at the national gallery on july 18 it will 
travel to the los angeles museum aug 21 through oct 30 the amon 
carter museum at fort worth texas jan 7 through march 12 and 
the new york historical society april 20 through june 25 
the national gallery show is the second in a threepart series 
devoted to american impressionist artists and underwritten by bell 
atlantic the first was an exhibition of paintings by william 
merritt chase last year the series will end in the fall of 1989 
with the works of john twachtman

neither 
side blinked when us and iranian ships glided silently past each 
other saturday in their closest encounter since a naval battle 
three weeks ago 
the 3700ton guided missile frigate jack williams spotted the 
booshehr a 354foot iranian supply boat on early morning patrol 
after the williams crossed the tense strait of hormuz twice in less 
than 24 hours 
the two ships sailed within about 2500 yards of each other on 
opposite courses in the rolling blue seas about 20 miles east of 
abu musa a heavily fortified island where iran maintains a gunboat 
base and air field 
the ships passed without any radio or other routine 
acknowledgement in an area almost within range of irans landbased 
chinesemade silkworm missiles the us navy calls the area the 
silkworm envelope but the crew uses the nickname the 
wormhole 
they are probably on patrol like us tracking ship movement 
gathering information said lt cmdr mark van dyke 
the booshehrs presence attracted curious crewmembers and their 
cameras 
a minespotting crewman stood at the bow of the iranian boat a 
sign of an apparent split between the regular iranian navy and the 
countrys revolutionary guards who seem to lay mines with autonomy 
thats nice a lookout on the williams told reporters when 
he saw his counterpart on the drab gray iranian ship even they 
dont know where the mines are 
american officers said the booshehr is one of only a few 
sightings of iranian warships that have crept out of port since the 
april 18 fighting 
the williams was at the center of those clashes which took 
place near where the ships passed saturday the us navy said 
after the april 18 clashes that it sank an iranian frigate 
disabled a second and hit four other ships a major loss for 
irans small navy 
a calm has settled over the persian gulf since then despite 
iranian threats of retaliation 
its nice to see their entire navy passing joked a chief 
petty officer on the bridge 
however iran still has its fleet of gunboats and other vessels 
as well as the ability to lay mines and the us navy has tried to 
remain vigilant 
before meeting the iranian boat the williams had completed 
escorting two tankers through the strait and into the gulf of oman 
a british destroyer hms gloucester rode shotgun for four tankers 
in the same convoy 
it was as though iran did not exist cmdr edward mann 
captain of the williams said of the quiet trip

the french found a way to win the release of their 
last three hostages in lebanon while denying with clear consciences 
they paid ransom according to iranian and french sources 
french commentators have shied away from the subject in the 
jubilant homecoming of jeanpaul kauffmann marcel carton and 
marcel fontaine the last of 10 hostages welcomed by premier 
jacques chirac in two years 
authorities have refused to discuss negotiations and if history 
is a guide they never will chirac facing presidential elections 
sunday denies there was a deal 
but sources with no stake in the negotiations describe the 
following accord with iran which then pressured the hezbollah and 
its terrorist wing islamic jihad to free the hostages 
france agreed to restore diplomatic relations with iran vital 
because of tehrans growing isolation falling oil receipts 
setbacks in the war with iraq and losses to the united states in 
the persian gulf 
france paid 400 million the last segment of a billiondollar 
dispute over a nuclearenergy project iran still demands 1 
billion in interest that is for next time one iranian source 
said only half in jest 
two terrorist groups in lebanon received 10 million from a 
mysterious iranian businessman likely to win lucrative favors from 
both countries 
france will reconsider the case of anis naccache in prison 
for trying to assassinate former prime minister shahpour bakhtiar 
of iran but he is not likely to be freed immediately 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity included 
iranian emigres western diplomats and french officials 
frances sudden release last month of suspected terrorist 
mohammed mohajer also was involved in the deal iranian sources 
said adding that mohajer is related to sheik ibrahim amin 
hezbollahs official spokesman 
after the hostages returned home an iranian journalist said a 
switchboard operator had begun answering embassy instead of 
interest section at irans paris headquarters 
algeria apparently guaranteed the arrangement in the name of 
friendship with france and islamic solidarity france made no 
commitment to cut back its arms sales to iraq to sell more to 
iran or to alter its middle east policy 
the release was planned for just after april 25 the first round 
of presidential elections but was delayed when syria tried to gain 
partial credit iranian sources said 
amir taheri former editor of the influential daily khayyan in 
iran and now a political analyst agreed with the sources version 
he said the deal clearly would encourage more terrorism 
we have reached a point where the taking of hostages is an 
accepted international practice he said iran sees it that 
way and so do others it is a sad fact but it is true 
the negotiations brought muted scorn in washington where the 
reagan administration has been shaken by revelations of its own 
secret deal with iran in britain however outrage was vehement 
under a headline reading shame of the craven french the 
daily sun wrote 
we have always warned that you cant trust the french they 
care only for themselves but even by french standards of 
chicanery the deal has a nasty odor about it unlike the 
french we do not crawl at the feet of scum 
contempt was heightened by the sudden appearance in paris of 
dominique prieur remanded on trust by new zealand after she was 
convicted of helping blow up the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior 
in which one person died 
chirac ended her confinement on a south pacific island two days 
before the election because she was pregnant and her father was 
ill her husband an army captain had been assigned to be with her 
adding that to the hostage deal londons telegraph observed 
the french government seems determined to plumb the depths of 
dishonor this is the country that calls us perfidious albion 
thats unmitigated gaul for you 
french interior minister charles pasqua retorted 
we have not ceded to any claim we have not accorded any funds 
of any sort to anyone not a franc not a dollar not a 
deutschmark not a yen 
the final arrangements were made by ayatollah janati kermani and 
jeancharles marchiani pasquas special envoy who confounded 
eavesdroppers by talking to paris in corsican patois french 
sources said marchiani had direct contacts with representatives of 
hezbollah 
the trickiest part apparently was paying off what is now called 
a loan in the eurodif project a consortium of france west 
germany spain and gabon to produce enriched african uranium for 
nuclear power plants 
shah mohammed reza pahlevi of iran joined eurodif in 1975 
investing 1 billion for 1175 percent of the shares and access to 
uranium from a plant in southern france 
after its revolution in 1979 iran renounced the deal and wanted 
its money back france arguing that the money was in shares said 
the capital had to be sold 
as a gesture to iran in 1986 chirac paid back a third after 
french negotiators agreed to convert irans particiption into a 
loan he paid another third in november as part of a previous 
hostage deal 
the latest payment clears the original amount but in a legal 
battle that has already reached 50000 pages of documents iran 
wants back interest because france has called the money a loan 
relations were broken in precipitous events leading up to the 
last hostage release 
iranian embassy officials in paris refused to let french 
authorities question wahid gordji an embassy official suspected of 
involvement with terrorism police surrounded the embassy 
in turn iranian troops sealed off the french embassy in tehran 
france said iran had effectively severed relations 
four months later both sieges were lifted gordji was allowed 
to slip out of france unquestioned the eurodif money was paid 
and french hostages roger auque and jeanlouis normandin came home

deportation 
many west bank arabs also have stopped paying some of their 
taxes israel television reported saturday that the government 
warned arab leaders it would cut off water and electricity to 10 
west bank villages unless residents paid what they owed

racial and sexual harassment and 
discrimination have been pervasive at the agency which handles most 
of the waste treatment in the minneapolisst paul area the state 
human rights department says 
the extent of it was large human rights commissioner 
stephen cooper said friday when the report about the metropolitan 
waste control commission was released 
there was a very lax effort to do anything about known 
problems cooper added 
women and minority workers faced hostile work environments and 
at times have been subject to different discipline than white male 
workers the report said 
the waste control commission which has an annual budget of 108 
million operates waste treatment plants that process 80 percent of 
the sewage in the metropolitan area it has about 980 employees 
and recent figures showed there were more than 140 women and almost 
100 minority group members 
commission officials said friday they will work with the human 
rights department in making changes recommended in the report they 
are to meet with cooper may 16 to discuss the recommendations 
we cant control how people think but we can say what is not 
tolerated said peter meintsma commission chairman the 
metropolitan waste control commission does and will continue to 
provide a fair and equitable work place 
meintsma said anyone who discriminates or harasses faces 
dismissal he said he did not expect major turnovers while the 
recommendations are carried out 
human rights department recommendations have the authority of 
law if the commission rejects them the department can sue the 
commission 
investigators found that racial discrimination sometimes 
included remarks or acts condoned by supervisors until recently 
the report said employees have been unclear about what sex 
discrimination is 
the report said the commissions disabilityleave policy also is 
discriminatory in addition the agency does not have an 
affirmative action staff to investigate discrimination complaints 
the report said 
the commission needs to set up training on racial and sexual 
harassment as well as disciplinary measures the report said 
meintsma said the commission already has enacted some of the 
recommendations sexual harassment training will be finished for 
all employees by the end of june and training on racial 
discrimination will follow he said 
the commission also is forming a 15member affirmative action 
committee and a staff member is examining the affirmative action 
office 
however a black former employee said he doubts the commissions 
commitment to change 
people cause this problem and problem people cannot be 
expected to straighten this out said makolle williams a former 
machinist at the commission who has filed suit against the 
commission alleging racial discrimination and harassment

some illinois shoppers are getting a 
new message at the checkout counter pregnant women need medical 
attention before their babies are born 
the message distributed in conjunction with mothers day is 
printed on shopping bags and is designed to reduce infant mortality 
illinois infant death rate has been above the national average 
for 22 consecutive years 
independent grocers throughout the state and some big chains 
have agreed to use the bags said us rep richard durbin dill 
they began appearing friday and soon up to 600 grocers will be 
helping to pass the message along durbin said 
the message under a headline a healthy mother means a healthy 
baby tells women that a babys life depends on early health 
care and provides a tollfree number at the illinois department 
of public health 
the states public health chief dr bernard j turnock said 
his agency would provide information for pregnant woman who have no 
insurance cannot afford a doctor or have other questions or 
problems 
he said women calling the hotline can be referred to local 
agencies and may be eligible for financial help 
durbin said he thought of the grocery bag idea after similar 
campaigns were used to help search for missing children he posed 
the idea to lobbyists representing grocery stores and they agreed 
i have young kids myself its a good way of communicating 
mark niederkorn manager of kennedys market in decatur said 
saturday 
turnock said infant mortality is one of the major problems 
facing the state particularly in central and southern illinois 
illinois ranks among the top 10 states in infant death rates and 
is the worst among northern industrial states 
last year more than 2000 illinois babies died before reaching 
their first birthday the infant mortality rate equalled 115 
deaths per 1000 live births 
turnock said poverty in cities and the decreasing numbers of 
hospitals and doctors who provide obstetric care in rural areas are 
two of the biggest reasons for infant mortality 
durbin a member of the house select committee on children 
represents the 20th congressional district which stretches from 
central illinois west to the mississippi river 
his goal is to circulate 5 million of the bags each week but 
about 180000 a week are being circulated for starters he said

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev went before top 
journalists and artists on saturday and asked them to back his 
program of reforms tass said 
also on saturday the communist party newspaper pravda called on 
representatives who will attend an important party conference next 
month to blunt those conservatives who doubt gorbachevs reforms 
tass said gorbachev addressed a meeting in the communist party 
central committee of editors of top staterun newspapers and 
literary journals and heads of artistic unions 
he called on editors and artists to all the more energetically 
help in the renewal of all sides of our life said the brief tass 
report it said a full report on the meeting would be published 
later 
pravdas frontpage article contained more criticism of a march 
13 article in another organ of the official press that questioned 
whether gorbachevs reforms had gone too far that article has 
caused an ideological controversy in the soviet press 
soviet officials rarely given any definitive word about 
ideological disputes in the party hierarchy but clues often appear 
in newspaper articles 
unconfirmed reports in moscow have said the article that started 
the dispute a letter by leningrad teacher nina andreyeva praising 
dictator josef v stalins role in soviet history had the backing 
of kremlin no 2 man yegor k ligachev and led to a showdown 
between him and gorbachev 
ligachev who is responsible for the partys ideology has 
struck a more conservative note than gorbachev especially on the 
soviet party chiefs call for glasnost or greater openness in 
discussing social issues 
tass said ligachev attended the meeting in the central 
committee as would be expected of the partys chief ideologist 
at several such meetings in recent months gorbachev has sought 
to define the limits of what is permissible in the soviet press 
under his more open policies 
delegates to the party conference scheduled for late june will 
not only have to defend the revolutionary way of thinking and 
acting but should the need arise give a courageous rebuff to 
conservative aspirations pravda said 
a lot will depend on their firm and principled stand most 
important the destiny of perestroika will depend on it pravda 
said perestroika is the term gorbachev uses for his economic 
and social reforms 
the party conference gives gorbachev a chance in between 
congresses held every five years to change the makeup of the 
policymaking central committee thereby strengthening his support 
in the top levels of the communist party 
the conference could be a major test of gorbachevs strength and 
determine how forcefully he can pursue reform 
two days after pravda printed its original response attacking 
the andreyeva letter on april 4 sovietskaya rossiya was forced to 
recant by publishing the pravda article in full without commentary 
pravda said in april that ms andreyevas letter should not have 
been printed 
but the debate in the press has not died out in the past week 
three papers have defend the right of gorbachevs opponents to 
speak out even if the party judges them to be wrong 
pravda said saturday that gorbachevs opponents had been 
underestimated but that they betrayed their true values through 
ms andreyevas letter 
the newspaper also tried to tie opponents of gorbachevs reforms 
to the ethnic disputes in the southern soviet republics of 
azerbaijan and armenia where at least 32 people died in late 
february and early march 
it said that party members were among the officials who either 
shirked their responsibilties or were afraid to act to stop rioting 
in the azerbaijani city of sumgait such people must be ready to 
take initiative and if they cannot must step aside for leaders 
who will pravda said

in jail and he died six days later in prison at hradec kralove 
rude pravo said an autopsy showed that wonka 35 died of 
pulmonary embolism a blockage of blood vessels 
the newspaper added that despite the finding the death was used 
by western anticommunist centers as a pretext for an 
attack on the communist state

statement by rep steny h hoyer dmd who is deputy chairman 
of the us delegation to the helsinki human rights conference in 
vienna

treatment in prison and us ambassador warren zimmermann made

amid piles of dirt dug up on the statehouse lawn 
during a renovation project archaeologists say they may have found 
traces of patriot john hancocks home 
the foundations of the granite mansion itself may be lost 
forever beneath the remains of later buildings but an 
archaeological company hired by the state reports that a 
5foothigh granite garden wall remains intact 
what we do have appears to be the back wall of the terrace 
gardens growing up the hill said michael roberts a partner in 
the groton mass firm time lines inc 
roberts said he and fellow archaeologists plan to recommend 
preserving the excavated site around the wall the firm is due to 
release a study of its findings later this month 
officials have halted work around the site while they study 
whether a nearby foundation could also be from the hancock mansion 
which was torn down in 1863 but roberts said he thinks that the 
foundation is part of a later building 
our analysis seems to indicate that the hancock house 
foundation itself was severly destroyed disturbed and removed when 
mansions in the 1860s were put in place on top of that property 
he said 
hancock the first signer of the declaration of independence in 
1776 lived in the beacon hill mansion most of his life one of 
bostons wealthiest men and later governor of massachusetts 
hancock received many a dignitary at the home including president 
george washington 
the mansion which had been built in 1733 for hancocks uncle 
was torn down 130 years later after the state failed to appropriate 
money to buy and preserve it the site now lies in front of a later 
west wing of the statehouse 
the state is spending 32 million on a renovation project in and 
around the statehouse due to be completed this summer excavation 
related to improvements in drainage on the grounds led to the 
discovery of the hancock wall the top of which lay 2 feet below 
ground 
when excavators discovered the wall and a nearby foundation 
city archaeologist stephen pendery called for a work stoppage 
arguing that the foundation was likely the hancock house like 
roberts state officials contended that the foundation was the 
remains of later townhouses but they finally agreed to stop work 
for the short term roberts said the wall will be preserved 
in place the way it is it will be covered over kept intact and 
well documented 
exposing the wall will require an excavation of some seven feet 
he said 
judging from descriptions of those who saw them the house and 
garden must have been splendid one 19th century account at the 
state library tells of a vast entrance hall that divided the 
mansion in the center and extended through to the rear where it 
gave upon a group of the loveliest gardens in boston laid out on 
the hillside against which the house nestled 
the wealthy merchant thomas hancock the houses original owner 
and johns uncle insisted on the finest fruit trees flowers and 
shrubbery for the garden 
when british soldiers occupied boston during the revolutionary 
war the home and ancillary buildings were a garrison and hospital 
for british soldiers surprisingly despite the hatred of the 
redcoats for john hancock the house was spared the destruction 
wrought on other boston homes 
a letter from a hancock relative tells of a backgammon table 
that was missing and how hancock insisted that the british replace 
it

swarms of locusts have been seen in 
saudi arabias agriculturally important northern regions but 
officials said saturday they were confident there would be no crop 
damage 
farther south on the arabian peninsula fears of a locust 
invasion were dispelled after agriculture officials took a closer 
look and found them to be grasshoppers 
a mjeni plant protection expert with the omani government 
said there were no locust sightings in the sultanate so far and he 
saw a minimal threat to the rest of the arabian peninsula 
a path of locusts has been moving recently through parts of 
north africa consuming large amounts of vegetation 
salem bomofleh directorgeneral of the agricultural research 
center in the saudi red sea port city of jiddah said some swarms 
sighted in northern regions of the kingdom covered an area of 36 
square miles 
two swarms were cited in tabuk where wheat is grown but 
bamofleh said those swarms were completely controlled before 
egglaying by both ground teams and aerial spraying 
six swarms in the aljouf area also a wheatproducing region 
have laid eggs that are expected to hatch in midmay 
equipped and qualified teams are controlling the locusts 
now bamofleh said by telephone they are also surveying the 
area to find out if more swarms have invaded 
but he said he did not expect the kingdom to experience any crop 
damage from the invasion 
the sightings have been confined to the countrys northern 
regions and there have been no reports of locusts in riyadh the 
capital 
in oman where locusts invaded a 14mile stretch in the eastern 
sharqiya region two years ago and stripped the area of vegetation 
worried farmers raised the alarm when when they spotted a massive 
swarm north of the capital muscat last month 
but when the investigating officials tracked it down to the 
village of bahla the intruders were revealed to be grasshoppers 
it was a case of mistaken identity almjeni said 
grasshoppers are attracted to light and not surprisingly they 
congregated near the governors office which is well illuminated at 
night people often mistake grasshoppers for locusts

the inflight breakup of a 19yearold aloha 
airlines boeing 737 has heightened concern about the safety of 
older jetliners but the problem has been known for years 
nearly a decade ago the industry and its regulators agreed to 
develop new safeguards against potentially catastrophic cracks and 
corrosion with a large portion of the nations commercial fleet 
already approaching old age a program begun in 1983 covers nearly 
1000 planes now flying 
but some aviation safety experts remained worried that while the 
monitoring program looked good on paper it might not always be 
carried through and that federal regulators werent able to 
backstop all cases 
according to the national transportation safety board the 
agency has investigated more than 80 incidents and accidents 
involving aircraft fatigue cracks or corrosion since 1975 though 
many were isolated to landing gear or engine problems at least 15 
cases involved cracks or corrosion on an aircrafts outer skin or 
on control devices 
on april 28 a 20foot section of the upper cabin of an aloha 
boeing 737 ripped away at 24000 feet exposing passengers to the 
open air and sweeping a flight attendant to her death before the 
pilot managed an emergency landing 
since then the federal aviation administration has ordered 
renewed inspections of older boeing 737s including mandatory 
highfrequency electronic testing of those that have more than 
50000 landings but safety experts note that special visual 
inspections of those planes including the aloha craft already 
were required at the time of the accident 
the cause of the aloha accident is yet to be determined 
precisely but the episode demonstrates a need to reevaluate the 
issues surrounding the aging fleet question especially as it 
relates to fatigue and corrosion cracking suggests joseph nall 
the ntsb member who headed the initial investigation at aloha last 
week 
investigators are certain the accident stemmed from a structural 
failure the unanswered question is why did such a structural 
problem on the 19yearold airplane which had nearly 90000 
landings go undetected 
where did the system of warnings inspections and preventative 
maintenance go awry 
its one thing to issue a piece of paper its something else 
to know with confidence that this stuff is being done the way you 
know it can be done says co miller a veteran aviation safety 
consultant and former government investigator it isnt just a 
simple issue of putting out an faa directive or a service 
bulletin 
aloha officials have maintained all along that they complied 
with all faa directives in connection with the plane 
according to the faa there are about 1000 commercial jets 
boeing 727s 737s 747s mcdonnell douglas dc9s and dc8s that 
are subject to the program designed in 1983 to monitor older 
aircraft more closely for structural defects 
the only reason there is the focus on the 737 is because it 
had the accident declares ben cosgrove vice president for 
engineering at the boeing airplane co 
the program was established after the airlines made it clear 
they plan to keep their jets longer because declining fuel costs 
lessened the attraction for investing in new more fuelefficient 
planes whatever new jets are bought are usually flown to expand 
service rather than as replacements 
as a result since 1979 the average age of the aircraft fleet 
belonging to the major airlines has increased from 1028 years to 
1253 years according to avmark inc an arlington va aircraft 
consulting and appraisal firm 
there are probably about 2300 airplanes now in service that 
are fundamentally over 20 years old built before 1968 says 
boeings cosgrove while these planes are capable of flying years 
longer after the 20year mark you should start expecting to see 
some more damage occur through fatigue and corrosion he 
acknowledges 
but both boeing and competitor mcdonnell douglas maintain that 
with close inspections and prompt maintenance these jetliners 
should have no problem flying well beyond their design life 
mcdonnell douglas a few years ago tested an old dc9 to an 
equivalent of 208000 landing cycles to see how it would hold up 
as a result of the test were very confident we have a dc9 life 
of at least 104000 landing cycles says jj mcgrew the 
manufacturers director of aircraft design 
different parts of the plane are affected differently but the 
strength of its fuselage and outer skin is most affected by the 
number of takeoff and landings each time a plane is pressurized 
the cabin wall expands slightly and then when depressurized it 
retracts that cycle can take its toll and can lead to a 
potentially dangerous failure if critical parts such as metal 
joints are weakened by corrosion according to technical experts 
the aloha aircraft had nearly 90000 such cycles in only 33000 
hours of flying since most flights shuttled among the hawaiian 
islands 
ironically it is such shorthaul flights that often are served 
by the older jets perhaps the most heavily traveled shorthaul 
system is eastern airlines washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle 
where 17 older boeing 727s are in use 
each of the eastern planes falls under the special faa 
inspection and maintenance program begun for older jets five years 
ago according to roger ferguson easterns vice president for 
maintenance and engineering although none approach the number of 
landings experienced by the aloha aircraft 
while maintenance costs for the older planes are higher as 
much as 1 times more for a 20 yearold plane as a 5yearold craft 
the older boeing jets continue to perform economically ferguson 
said the planes including the top of the fuselage are visually 
inspected for cracks every 1100 landings said ferguson 
john obrien safety and engineering specialist at the air line 
pilots association says there is an inadequate number of faa 
inspectors and complains that airlines occasionally ignore 
maintenance bulletins from the manufacturers because they are not 
mandatory he says the faa often is under pressure from the 
industry not to issue mandatory directives except as a last 
resort

illinois democrats divided the last of 
their delegates between favorite sons paul simon and jesse jackson 
on saturday although a party leader said simons delegates might 
vote for someone else at the democratic national convention 
supporters of jackson who initially complained about simon 
receiving the delegates said they were satisfied with the deal 
struck saturday and expected to pick up some those who defect from 
the illinois senator 
if paul is not there as a choice i would suspect that many of 
the people on the unity slate would vote for reverand jackson 
said leon finney jr jacksons illinois campaign director 
simon received 47 delegates and jackson 13 based on the results 
of the states march 15 primary the individuals to serve in those 
statewide slots were picked saturday by the state party central 
committee 
overall simon has 148 delegates from illinois and jackson has 
41 most of whom were elected directly from the primary ballot by 
congressional district 
simon was eligible for atlarge delegates because he suspended 
his campaign but did not formally drop out of the race that tactic 
angered supporters of jackson who ran second in illinois and would 
have collected all of the states atlarge delegates had simon 
dropped out 
some jackson allies accused simon of playing an unwitting role 
in a stopjackson movement and hinted that simon might face a 
black voter backlash should he seek reelection to the us senate 
in 1990 
state democratic chairman vince demuzio said he approached both 
camps about a negotiated solution to the delegate disputes in hopes 
of avoiding a split in the state party 
it became clear that they were interested as we were in doing 
this in a unified manner and in a manner that was peaceful and 
harmonious he said 
demuzio said he could not dispute suggestions that democratic 
heavyweights pledged to simon might feel free to cut their own 
deals at the party convention in atlanta 
they have a moral obligation to vote for the candidate to 
which they were pledged but i think for the most part they will 
likely be free agents demuzio said 
simons operatives also acknowledged that some of their choices 
for atlarge delegates were dumped from the slate during 
negotiations with the jackson campaign 
we both left a lot of blood on the streets as well as some 
good and deserving people said jerry sinclair simons illinois 
campaign director

the government on saturday banned half of 
the citys taxis and cars from the athens area in an emergency move 
to improve air quality 
athens has been covered by a thick brown haze for three days 
aided by strong northerly breezes the measures seemed to be 
working 
there has been a significant reduction in atmospheric 
pollution because of the measures and improved weather 
conditions said constantine bourkas director of the staterun 
program for pollution control 
bourkas said the wind coming after two days of calm weather 
blew some of the pollution out of the mountainringed athens basin 
a brown smog hangs over athens most of the year it is formed 
when a strip of cold air moves on top of a strip of warm air and 
traps it over the city 
the measures banned half of the citys 730000 automobiles and 
15000 taxis from a 115squaremile zone around the city center 
only vehicles with license plates ending in odd numbers were 
allowed in the area 
they also ordered the citys 120 largest industries to reduce 
output by 30 percent 
the traffic measures lasted only until saturday afternoon while 
the industrial restriction was ordered to last until 6 am sunday 
the citys automobiles dieselpowered taxis and aging buses are 
mainly responsible for the pollution

the national transportation safety board is 
preparing to issue its findings this week on the probable cause of 
the crash last august of northwest flight 255 the seconddeadliest 
air disaster in us history 
the airplane an md80 or stretch version of the dc9 crashed 
aug 16 just outside detroit metropolitan airport while trying to 
take off on a flight to phoenix ariz 
just one person aboard the plane a 4yearold girl survived 
the crash her mother father brother and 153 other people were 
killed 
the girl cecelia cichan attracted gifts and letters from 
around the nation while she was hospitalized 
she is living with an aunt and uncle in birmingham ala and 
relatives have pledged to make every effort to let the girl now 5 
live as normal a life as possible 
the ntsb scheduled a hearing tuesday in washington to issue its 
finding of the probable cause of the crash second only to the may 
25 1979 crash of a dc10 at chicagos ohare airport that killed 
275 people 
the northwest airlines plane never got more than 50 feet off the 
ground before it clipped a light pole in a parking lot sliced a 
chunk from the roof of a building and crashed onto a fourlane 
highway 
the plane broke apart while it skidded down the road slamming 
into a railroad trestle and two overpasses carrying traffic on 
interstate 94 
the ntsb final report is expected to focus on the setting of the 
airplanes flaps and slats panels on the leading and trailing 
edges of the wings that are extended to give aircraft extra lift 
during takeoffs 
federal investigators have said the flaps on the doomed airplane 
were not extended as they should have been for takeoff from the 
airports shortest runway 
at an ntsb public hearing last november several theories 
emerged about why the flaps werent set or why the crew wasnt 
warned 
the pilot and copilot forgot an ntsb transcript of a cockpit 
voice recording during the halfhour before the crash has no 
reference to a checklist procedure to check the setting of the 
flaps and slats but northwest had an independent analysis done on 
a copy of the tape and concluded that it contained flaps and 
flaps set command and response 
an alarm system designed to signal when flaps were set 
improperly failed there was testimony questioning the reliability 
of a key circuit breaker within the system 
a crew member disabled the alarm system when the airplane 
landed at metro airport after a flight from saginaw the cockpit 
voice recorders tape is a 30minute loop which did not go back far 
enough to catch the sound of the circuit breaker being pulled 
more than a dozen court actions have been filed by survivors of 
crash victims and all have been moved to federal court in detroit 
the fbi and the wayne county sheriffs department are still 
looking for the mysterious father john irish a man who posed as a 
roman catholic priest and comforted the victims families while 
referring them to a florida lawyer 
a federal warrant has been issued for the man who was charged 
last october with fraud in wayne county for accumulating about 
1000 worth of hotel food and telephone expenses paid for by 
northwest

the communist party newspaper pravda said saturday 
that soviet troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan under battle 
conditions and indicated more may be killed 
the soviet news media has provided little coverage of the soviet 
military involvement in afghanisan but the pravda article reported 
comments of red army soldiers about the withdrawal and their slain 
comrades it apparently was designed to prepare soviet citizens for 
more deaths as the soldiers pull out 
under an april 14 agreement between pakistan and afghanistan 
the soviet union will begin on may 15 to withdraw its estimated 
115000 military personnel in afghanistan they entered afghanistan 
in december 1979 to help the marxist government fight 
anticommunist guerrillas 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has called the war a 
bleeding wound for the soviet union but soviet casualties have 
never been revealed 
the pravda article headlined the last summer said soviet 
troops were preparing to come home it was accompanied by a picture 
of three smiling soldiers 
however the daily newspaper said the withdrawal of soviet 
units for home is a complicated operation it will be carried out 
in war conditions 
pravda said rebels were continuing to fight soviet and afghan 
government soldiers trying to spoil the process of 
reconciliation and working to pile up weapons inside 
afghanistan to create there stockpiles and bases 
it said the rebels were attacking cities intimidating citizens 
and committing sabotage 
pravda quoted one soldier v malashkin as telling about the 
death of a friend who was captain of a helicopter shot down by 
rebels on april 18 it said the pilot capt sergei gusev had left 
a wife son and daughter in minsk he had served in afghanistan 
eight months and had been decorated twice according to the report 
the soviets have pledged to withdraw all their soldiers from 
afghanistan in nine months

the state department said on saturday it was 
forced to withdraw a diplomat from the us embassy in singapore 
but denied that asian nations charge the envoy meddled in internal 
affairs 
the first secretary in the us mission in singapore e mason 
hendrickson was withdrawn with deep regret at singapores 
request even though he did nothing wrong said ben justesen a 
state department spokesman 
according to the singapore home affairs ministry hendrickson 
urged a group of lawyers to contest the elections against the 
government and had involved himself in singapores domestic 
politics 
it is perfectly legitimate for hendrickson to keep in touch 
with leaders of the constitutional opposition in order to 
analyze and understand singapore politics the ministry said 
but it said the diplomat had met with the lawyers in order to 
attack the singapore government and instigate them to stand for 
election against the government 
justesen said singapore asked the united states to withdraw 
hendrickson who left the country saturday in keeping with 
established international law that gives a government the right 
without having to explain its decision to order a diplomat out 
we do not accept the basis for the singapore governments 
request that mr hendrickson be withdrawn that he acted in any 
way improperly justesen said 
he said the diplomats activities were entirely in keeping 
with normal diplomatic practice and his responsibilities as a 
foreign service officer 
in meeting with members of political opposition which appears 
to be the basis of the singapore governments protest mr 
hendrickson was doing what american diplomats are expected to do in 
any country namely to be in touch with a broad spectrum of 
individuals in order to report accurately developments in the 
country 
justesen said the united states rejected singapores additional 
request that two senior us officials be reprimanded the 
officials were not named 
the spokesman also said he could not provide biographical 
information about hendrickson 
in the elections to be held sometime before the end of next 
year prime minister lee kuan yews peoples action party is 
overwhelmingly favored to retain control 
the ministry statement said a lawyer patrick seong was 
arrested april 19 and disclosed that hendrickson had made appeals 
to him 
on friday the ministry said francis seow tiang siew a 
prominent lawyer had been arrested under the internal security act 
for questioning into possible foreign interference in singapores 
internal affairs 
earlier in the week the ministry said foreigners were behind a 
recent joint statement by dissident singaporeans that they were 
illtreated while in jail and forced to confess to subversion 
singapore considers the us to be a good friend it values 
the friendly and cordial ties it enjoys with the us it wants to 
maintain and build upon that longterm relationship the ministry 
said 
the reagan administration has had good relations with singapore 
a prosperous former british colony in southeast asia though 
american officials have occasionally said they disagree with 
singapores restrictions on dissent and the press us expressions 
of concern have been muted 
there have been some economic disputes between the two 
countries singapore has accused the united states of trade 
protectionism and has joined in foreign denunciations of the trade 
bill president reagan says he will veto

a moneystarved project to study 
dolphin deaths along the east coast is receiving a cash infusion 
from the navy and the national marine fisheries service 
the office of naval research has handed over 50000 for the 
dolphin study and tom mcintyre of the fisheries service said his 
agency soon will chip in another 50000 
the animals are still dying the navy felt it was appropriate 
that the investigation continue they did a review of his proposal 
and it was accepted we are in the process of moving our money 
mcintyre said friday 
the beneficiary is a task force headed by canadian researcher 
dr joseph geraci who has anxiously awaited more money since the 
studys funding ran out earlier this year 
geraci professor of veterinary medicine in the pathology 
department at the university of guelph near toronto is a member of 
the us marine mammal commission the us goverment asked him to 
head the research begun last july when hundreds of dead dolphins 
began washing ashore in new jersey and virginia the deaths spread 
down the coast reaching florida in november 
fisheries service statistics put the official east coast dolphin 
death toll at 742 but the actual number is probably much higher 
because mammals that didnt wash ashore couldnt be counted 
the cause of the deaths is unknown although scientists believe 
something is sapping the dolphins immune systems leaving them to 
languish and die from common infections 
the fisheries service fears that as much as 40 percent of the 
east coasts dolphin population has been wiped out 
it could take decades to recover said lesley scheele a 
dolphin project coordinator for the environmental group greenpeace

william j bennett a magnet for controversy 
throughout his 3 years as secretary of education is getting ready 
to take an early fall departure from the cabinet 
bennett told education writers in new orleans last month that he 
probably would resign then his spokesman loye miller denied 
rumors of a more imminent departure 
what lies ahead for the brash combative bennett who has 
clashed repeatedly with teacher unions quarreled with the surgeon 
general over aids education accused college presidents of being 
greedy and upbraided harvard and stanford for changes in their 
curriculum 
bennett who delivered the commencement address saturday at the 
university of southern mississippi in hattiesburg was asked 
following his speech whether he would resign this fall and said he 
hadnt made any definite plans asked about future employment 
bennett quipped usm hasnt offered me a position here 
he is expected to hit the lecture circuit and to write a book 
capsulizing his critiques of the quality of americas schools and 
colleges 
bennett who converted from the democratic to the republican 
party on may day in 1986 has already proven a big draw on the gop 
fundraising circuit where he has been much in demand as an 
afterdinner speaker 
one speculated post is apparently not in the cards the 
vicepresidency on george bushs tickets 
although bennett is widely believed to have had his eye on that 
spot bush has been conspicuously silent about bennett during all 
his talk about being the education president aids to bennett 
who asked not to be identified said they have had virtually no 
contacts with the bush camp in recent months and bennett is not

gen manuel antonio noriega said he 
rejected a us ultimatum to resign and leave panama but was 
considering a guatemalan proposal to end his countrys political 
and economic crisis 
guatemala said saturday it has offered its help as mediator 
noriega head of the countrys 15000member defense forces and 
de facto national leader also said assistant secretary of state 
elliott abrams is damaging the reagan administration 
misinforming it and the us public about the panamanian reality 
noriega was interviewed in sajalices friday after he inaugurated 
a water line to the small community 
the general said william g walker deputy assistant secretary 
of state for interamerican affairs came in with an ultimatum 
in midmarch to leave in 48 hours noriega said he rejected it 
walker was in panama at the time to discuss terms under which 
noriega might step down 
noriega was indicted in florida last february on drug 
trafficking charges he calls the indictments politically motivated 
noriega said friday he had received what he called a 
positive proposal for a possible solution to the dispute that 
was submitted by guatemalan president vinicio cerezo 
he did not elaborate on the proposal but said had had listened 
to it with interest because it comes from the region it is more 
in tune with panamanian reality 
in guatemala presidential spokesman julio santos said saturday 
that cerezo offered his mediation so that the panamanian problem 
is resolved by the peaceful and diplomatic route 
the government of guatemala ratifies its offer to mediate the 
panamanian problem he said he gave no details of the offer 
guatemalas ambassador to panama retired gen rodolfo lobos 
zamora has been called home twice for consultations about the 
3monthold crisis santos said 
sources close to noriega who had access to the meetings with the 
us envoys in march said the general was offered an undisclosed 
amount of money and immunity from extradition if he and 25 of his 
closest military collaborators left the country 
asked if he had been offered money noriega laughed and declined 
comment saying i do not want to make anyones life difficult 
the general has offered to resign before panamanian elections 
scheduled for may 1989 subject to what he called a national 
dialogue and a panamanian solution he has denied washington 
reports of a deal with the us state department under which he 
would but remain in panama 
there are no negotiations he said in the interview we do 
not negotiate the dignity of a country and do not negotiate the 
dignity of a man 
he said he has talked with us officials but not negotiated 
abrams he said has a specific plan of misinformation 
because all his previous advice to president reagan has been 
a failure 
it the united states does not want friendly governments it 
wants docile governments he said it does not want to win 
friends it wants to buy them 
us economic sanctions including freezing of panamas national 
bank assets in the united states and the refusal to pay tolls for 
panama canal use have caused a shortage of cash in a country that 
uses the dollar as its national currency 
the sanctions were ordered after president eric arturo delvalle 
tried to fire noriega in late february but delvalle was voted out 
of office the following day by noriega supporters in parliament 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as the countrys 
president

minutes of one another and about one block apart saturday

away it started in a twostory apartment building and spread to 
the building next door

damage in 30 minutes sweeping through a maintenance garage and 
trailer house and exploding at least three tanks of acetylene and 
oxygen used for welding st john the baptist parish sheriffs

pope john paul ii on saturday 
expressed approval of strikes by polish workers and declared that 
only fundamental political changes leading to democracy can resolve 
the crisis in his homeland 
speaking with reporters aboard the special boeing 747 alitalia 
plane at the start of a 12day tour of four south american 
countries john paul called a lack of democracy the central 
problem of poland 
the pope expressed moral support for the strikes that began in 
communist poland last month and said neither superficial 
reforms nor resorting to force by the government were the answer to 
polands problems 
the statements were his strongest since the labor unrest began 
certainly strikes are a justified method to defend justice in 
the socioeconomic and sociopolitical fields and this is part 
of the churchs social doctrine the pope said 
he stressed the need for a dialogue and said here we are 
touching the heart of the problem the problem of the lack of true 
democracy that i think is the crucial problem the central problem 
of poland 
the roman catholic church which traditionally has played a 
major role in predominantly catholic poland supported solidarity 
the first free labor union in the soviet bloc when it was created 
in 1980 solidarity was suspended by the government in december 
1981 and subsequently outlawed 
john paul said he had no reason to doubt soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs declared intentions for reforms but said it is not 
easy to democratize a system that is by definition dictatorial and 
totalitarian 
john paul also took issue with moves in the us congress that 
would single out bolivia peru and paraguay three of the four 
countries on his itinerary for economic aid sanctions on grounds 
they are failing to cooperate with the united states in the war on 
drugs 
well are there only these countries he asked raising his 
voice are only these countries responsible and guilty or 
are there others that collaborate that profit from this and are 
not punished if not whole countries then groups 
the three countries need help not a punishment or a 
sanction he added 
a vatican official traveling with the pope who briefed reporters 
on grounds of anonymity said john paul was referring to the 
responsibility of drug consumers in the united states and other 
countries as well as international traffickers 
drug trafficking and its international implications is expected 
to be one of the popes major themes as he travels to 
cocaineproducing centers in bolivia after ending his 46hour visit 
to uruguay on monday

popular former gov reubin askew gave up 
his bid for a us senate seat on saturday even though he was 
leading the race saying its just not right that candidates 
must spend 75 percent of their time raising money 
askew said he also was motivated by a desire to spend more time 
with his family he said he would support a fellow democrat us 
rep buddy mackay of ocala for the senate 
i found myself increasingly concerned about the extraordinary 
cost of running a statewide campaign in florida today askew said 
in a statement released by his campaign headquarters 
of course i knew that before i announced my candidacy in 
december but frankly i underestimated the time and effort it 
would take and how it would limit my ability to have more direct 
contact with the voters 
the announcement stunned democrats who were losing a second 
wellknown candidate for the seat incumbent sen lawton chiles 
announced in december that he would not seek election this fall to 
a fourth term 
that is a very devastating thing to have happen a 
frontrunner withdraw from the race said state democratic party 
chairman charles whitehead early saturday after published reports 
in the tallahasee democrat and the orlando sentinel broke the story 
askews war chest had reached 1 million but a 1986 senate race 
in which former gov bob graham ousted republican paula hawkins 
cost both sides a total of 15 million 
as ive said during this campaign something is seriously 
wrong with our system when many candidates for the senate need to 
spend 75 percent of their time raising money askew said its 
just not right 
i hope the senate will start bringing some reason to the 
question of raising this much money askew said later at a news 
conference at his orlando law office 
he said he originally believed he could get by with a 32 
million budget then he thought of limiting contributions but 
realized he would still need 43 million then it got to be 57 
million 
askew said the amount of time he would have to spend away from 
his family was also at the forefront of his decision to qut the 
race 
the demands of the campaign reminded me forcefully of the 
demands on my family said askew with his wife donna at his 
side they have two adult children 
askew 59 was governor from 1971 to 1979 then served in the 
carter administration as a trade ambassador he made a brief run 
for the presidency in 1984 dropping out after finishing last in 
the new hampshire democratic primary 
he had held a commanding lead in published polls for the 
democratic nomination over his only official democratic challenger 
us rep dan mica the primary is set for september polls also 
showed askew with a lead over the likely republican challenger 
us rep connie mack 
i came to realize that im not prepared to reassume all the 
demands of elective office askews statement said 
in recent weeks i have found myself treasuring a onceaweek 
lunch break with wife donna lou at an orlando lakeside restaurant 
the only respite from the consuming demands of the campaign and 
we both know that those demands dont end on election day askew 
said 
askew said he had informed mackay of his decision early 
saturday mackay immediately said he would enter the senate race 
and askew said he would support and campaign for him 
buddy mackay is running for the us senate we will have an 
offical announcement monday said greg farmer mackays press 
secretary 
mackay 55 ran unsuccessfully for the us senate in 1980 
losing the primary to another democrat who then lost the general 
election to hawkins 
farmer said askews decision was a stunning surprise especially 
following chiles withdrawal 
welcome to the twilight zone of politics if you dont like 
floridas politics wait five minutes and theyll change said 
farmer

tangled wreckage hampered the search for a worker still missing 
saturday in the wake of an explosion and fire at a louisiana oil 
refinery while fire officials said californias tallest building 
would remain closed indefinitely following a deadly fire 
an official of a rocket fuel company whose plant exploded on the 
edge of a nevada town said a replacement plant would be built at a 
more remote location 
six bodies had been recovered at the refinery two people died 
in the nevada blast and the california disaster killed one person 
two crews worked through a maze of wrecked equipment saturday at 
the refinery at norco la skirting small fires in the search for 
the missing man 
shell oil co spokesman bill gibson said company engineers and 
safety and environmental experts were trying to find out what 
caused the explosion 
theyve gotten out right out into the area as close as they 
safely could he said saturday 
the causes of the three conflagrations all of which began 
during a 14hour period wednesday and thursday have not been 
determined 
in los angeles fire officials were joined by state legislators 
and local politicians in calling for a tough new law requiring 
sprinklers in hundreds of older highrises in the wake of the fire 
late wednesday and early thursday that destroyed 4 floors of the 
62story first interstate bank tower 
the building was built in 1973 one year before a law was passed 
requiring sprinklers in all new buildings over 75 feet tall 
the building was ordered closed indefinitely friday said 
russell e lane the citys chief building inspector he said 
repair work cannot begin until the steel superstructure is 
extensively tested 
in advance of that testing we had the original architects and 
engineers go in and they were very pleased with the shape of the 
building said bank vice president simon barkerbenfield he said 
a few people had been allowed into the building to begin the 
process of salvaging files and that kind of thing 
operators of the demolished pacific engineering amp production co 
rocket fuel plant at henderson nev were fined four times in the 
last five years for safety violations but state officials defended 
the plant friday as having a good moderate record overall 
company officials have also consulted with the fbi about the 
possibility of sabotage but do not consider it likely said keith 
rooker pacific engineerings executive vice president at a news 
conference saturday 
rooker said locations in more remote regions of nevada texas 
and utah were being considered for a replacement for the plant 
destroyed wednesday 
the plant had been given 10 citations from 11 state inspections 
since 1983 but the problems were mostly minor said jim barnes 
state industrial relations director 
the company produced ammonium perchlorate a component of the 
solid rocket fuel used in some military missiles and the space 
shuttles booster rockets 
kerrmcgee corp makes the same chemical in a plant about a mile 
closer to most of hendersons residential area that plant was shut 
down voluntarily thursday and some worried residents want to keep 
it closed 
the blast damaged homes and businesses in henderson and 326 
people were treated for injuries 
the explosion at a shell oil co refinery at norco la 
shattered hundreds of windows in homes and stores in the area and 
shook buildings in new orleans 30 miles to the east 
the area is very much in disarray plant manager fred foster 
said friday there are large pieces of equipment off of 
foundations and down around the cat cracker 
the catalytic cracker is used to break crude oil into usable 
products 
we still have a few small flames burning and so we have not 
gotten into the unit company spokeswoman wendy jacobs said 
saturday 
the body of one shell employee was found shortly after the blast 
and five others were found friday one person was missing 
the cause of the los angeles highrise fire may never be known 
because of the extreme heat of the blaze said fire department 
battalion chief gary r bowie 
the chief spokesman for first interstate bancorp discounted 
arson speculation prompted by news that the companys capital 
markets group which employs 100 people on the floor where the fire 
apparently broke out was sold in a deal that closed wednesday 
night 
i firmly belive that at this stage its random chance said 
spokesman john popovich if the idea is that there is a 
disgruntled employee that would have been six months ago when 
the decision to sell was announced 
a sprinkler system was being installed in the building but was 
not yet complete los angeles city councilman nate holden 
introduced a motion friday to require owners of all highrises to 
install sprinkler systems 
about 200 members of the california fire chiefs association 
attending an annual convention urged that sprinklers be required 
in all buildings more than 75 feet tall 
state sen art torres said friday he will introduce a bill in 
the state legislature this week to require sprinklers in all 
commercial highrise structures in california

an opposition group calling itself the democratic 
union held an organizational meeting saturday to establish a 
political party as an alternative to the communist party a leading 
dissident said 
police including some ranking officers gathered outside the 
downtown apartment building where the meeting was held sergei 
grigoryants said sunday he said he knew of no arrests 
grigoryants who has been active among moscows dissidents said 
he went by the building but did not participate in the meeting 
the soviet communist party has ruled as the only official 
political party since the 1917 bolshevik revolution and has given 
no indication it is willing to accept any organized opposition 
attempts in the past to organize opposition parties have led to 
arrests imprisonment or exile 
grigoryants said the goal of the democratic union is creation of 
a democratic pluralistic society without a central role for the 
communist party 
he said as many as 250 people from moscow leningrad 
novosibirsk and the ukraine gathered saturday to discuss the goals 
of the group and prepare documents declaring their principles 
there was no confirmation of that figure and few apartments in the 
capital could accommodate such a large crowd 
the talks are expected to continue for two or three days 
according to grigoryants 
the group gathered in the krasnaya presnaya neighborhood in an 
apartment building near the modern office building housing the 
government of the russian federation the largest of the 15 
republics that make up the soviet union 
also meeting in moscow this weekend were representatives of some 
30 independent publications that have been established in defiance 
of the governments monopoly on published information 
the newspapers and journals concerned primarily with political 
and religious affairs have limited circulation because the 
government controls all printing presses some are only typewritten 
sheets passed among friends 
it was the second meeting of independent publishers a similar 
session was held in leningrad last fall 
such open gatherings are an indication of the increased official 
tolerance of dissent since mikhail gorbachev came to power three 
years ago as communist party chief 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness encourages greater 
discussion of some issues and debate within the party apparatus 
but he and other officials have said glasnost has its limits and 
it is not clear how much opposition the government and party are 
willing to tolerate 
democratization is one of the key words of gorbachevs program 
for reforming the soviet system but he has used it to mean greater 
participation in the affairs of the government party and staterun 
enterprises 
he has promoted democratization as a means of shaking up the 
entrenched bureaucracy and installing a more aggressive leadership 
he has not however suggested the process should go so far as to 
permit a direct challenge to the communist partys monopoly on 
power

rocket manufacturer morton thiokol is 
considering importing a fuel component used in space shuttle 
boosters following the destruction of a nevada fuel plant a 
company spokesman said saturday 
tremendous explosions that flattened pacific engineering amp 
production co killing two people and injuring 300 others halted 
production of the powerful oxidizer ammonium perchlorate used in 
the solid fuel that powers the booster rockets 
the unexplained blast at henderson nev on wednesday also 
prompted the closure of a nearby kerrmcgee chemical inc plant 
the only other domestic source of the oxidizer 
buying the oxidizer from european sources is an alternative 
being considered by morton thiokol and its customers including the 
defense department and the national aeronautics and space 
administration said company spokesman rocky raab 
were considering all our options he said in the meantime 
the government and morton thiokol were assessing their fuel 
inventories 
pacific engineering lost nearly 3 million pounds of the oxidizer 
that was to be delivered to the air force in june for use in the 
titan rocket program said keith rooker a company spokesman the 
company also provided oxidizer for the mx and minuteman missiles 
key parts of the nations nuclear defense 
the loss of the manufacturing capability of the plant if not 
replaced represents a serious threat to the national defense and a 
crippling blow to the nations space program rooker said at a 
news conference saturday in las vegas nev 
morton thiokol representatives were in nevada to discuss the 
situation with pacific engineering and kerrmcgee but the 
companies spokesmen did not know the outcome of the talks 
a spokesman for kerrmcgee corp headquarters in oklahoma city 
said the company still had to determine when its operation could 
resume and whether it should plan for increased production 
if the government and its subcontractors say they are going 
to need enhanced production kerrmcgee will do everything possible 
to comply said the spokesman paul reed 
manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate in europe include the 
national society of powders and chemical in france and chemische 
fabrik uetikon in switzerland 
morton thiokol mixes the oxidizer with other materials at its 
wasatch operations in northern utah making the solid fuel in 
rocket casings which are shipped to customers 
the shuttles motors are assembled with the rocket booster 
segments at kennedy space center nasa officials have said that 
since the rocket motors for the space shuttle discovery arrived

pope john paul ii on saturday began a 
12day fourcountry mission to south america and told nominally 
roman catholic uruguayans to pay attention to the christian 
message 
set your eyes on jesus this country was born christian the 
pope said in this country where church and state are rigorously 
divided even to the point of calling christmas families day 
smiling and appearing relaxed after a 13hour flight from rome 
john paul his white robes blown by a chilly fall wind shook hands 
with president julio maria sanguinetti a selfprofessed agnostic 
the president wearing a dark business suit did not bow or kiss 
the popes ring as latin american leaders often do he welcomed the 
pontiff in a spirit of tolerance beyond religious beliefs and 
emphasized uruguays defense of civilian and religious freedom in 
all its imaginable extensions 
uruguays 3 million people of whom 80 percent say they are 
catholic seemed lukewarm at best about the papal visit the white 
and yellow vatican flags and the huge papal billboards that usually 
herald the pontiffs arrival in latin america were not in evidence 
the pope did make page 1 of the saturday edition of the 
montevideo newspaper la manana but the main headline read 
measures approved for meat sector a reference to uruguays 
important beef trade 
when john paul visited uruguay for the first time last year 
there was public enthusiasm but this time as taxi driver arturo 
branco put it perhaps the novelty is gone 
the pontiff received cheers and applause however from an 
estimated 82000 young people when he arrived at the centenary 
soccer stadium to address the nations youth 
the people cheered and shouted viva long life as john 
paul told them to meditate on the message of jesus and build 
a more just and fraternal society 
they also applauded when the pope standing on an outdoor stage 
urged them to be aware of abortion and divorce 
dont fear children who may come dont let civilian authority 
put obstacles in the path of fecundity the pontiff said 
abortion was legal in uruguay from 1934 to 1938 but now is illegal 
marital fidelity has not gome out of style the pope said 
uruguay legalized divorce in 1907 becoming one of the first 
catholic countries to do so 
later saturday the pope addressed about 500 religious leaders 
and students at the catholic university and told them to continue 
working together to form a friendlier and more humane world a 
culture more truthful and more beautiful 
he then retired to the papal envoys residence for the night 
reports from the vatican said the pope would try to persuade 
uruguayans to think twice about their independent securalism on 
grounds that this is a country that does not reflect on its 
destiny 
uruguay which is the size of washington state and lies between 
south american giants brazil and argentina was a pioneer in 
legalizing divorce ousting catholic church doctrine from public 
schools and even removing crucifixes from taxsupported hospitals 
it changed the names of major holidays to take out religious 
references and until 1984 resisted establishment of a catholic 
university 
the churchs only significatnt victory came in 1938 when it 
successfully pressed for the repeal of a law legalizing abortion 
president sanguinetti a civilian lawyer and journalist says he 
believes in god but not in formal religion 
in the capital montevideo john paul planned to say an outdoor 
mass in a 82000capacity soccer stadium meet with the nations 
bishops and address students and representatives of the local 
protestant and jewish communities 
the popes threeday stay in uruguay also includes trips to 
three interior towns he plans five days in bolivia a major source 
of the worlds cocaine where government austerity measures to 
eliminate 20000 percent inflation have caused serious labor unrest 
john paul then heads for a 1day stay in lima the capital of 
peru another major cocaine source and the scene of violence by 
antigovernment marxist insurgents 
the journey the popes 37th foreign mission in his nearly 10 
years in the vatican ends with three days in paraguay which has 
a reputation as an international center of smuggling the pope 
returns to rome on may 18 his 68th birthday

downpour in californias capital saturday while hundreds more 
participated in rallies in washington dc albany ny and

in rosemont ill 10 people were arrested in a protest of what 
they said was a 500 percent price increase for a drug to treat aids 
by a company under federal scrutiny for qualitycontrol measures 
the demonstrations were part of a nationwide effort by gay 
activists to call attention to the aids epidemic and discrimination 
against homosexuals 
the sacramento march was one of the largest ever at the 
california capital state police estimated the crowd at 6000 to 
10000 marchers and organizers who had hoped for up to 50000 
people blamed the rain for lowering the turnout 
carrying signs that read ignorance is the real disease and 
placards from counties throughout the state marchers chanted 
cheered and sang their way through the streets of downtown 
sacramento 
a ballooncarrying delegation from politically conservative 
orange county chanted orange county aint so straight other 
marchers some wrapped in plastic trash bags to stay dry chanted 
fight aids fight back 
part of a makeshift stage on the capitol steps was set aside for 
people with aids 
i wouldve come even if i was very very sick because this 
means something said bobby kennedy an aids patient from san 
francisco who sat bundled in blankets in a wheelchair were 
living proof that what theyre doing is not ok 
marchers also rallied at the capitol steps in albany handing 
out leaflets and displaying a quilt whose patches portrayed the 
names of new yorkers who have died of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
we are demanding that gov mario cuomo and the state 
legislature intensify their efforts to develop a comprehensive 
range of services for people with aids libby post of the new 
york state lesbian and gay lobby told the crowd of about 400 
she said a state policy on aids should include quality health 
care and housing for aids victims an end to discrimination access 
to promising experimental treatment and an aids prevention program 
for all new yorkers 
in the nations capital shouting handclapping demonstrators 
gathered across pennsylvania avenue from the white house although 
president reagan was away for the weekend at his camp david retreat 
the demonstrators chanted reagan reagan you cant hide we 
charge you with genocide 
across the street another group held up signs urging reagan to 
move more vigorously against the regime of panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega together the two groups had about 200 
protesters 
in ohio about 100 people gathered in downtown cincinnati for a

corporate headquarters of lyphomed inc maker of pentamidine a 
medication used to fight a form of pneumonia that frequently kills 
people with aids 
lyphomed has been under investigation by the federal food and 
drug administration which in a routine check last year found 
underfilled vials of drugs and indications of contamination the 
company said it appointed a new director of quality control and 
vowed to correct the problems 
the protesters contend that lyphomed has raised the price of 
pentamidine 500 percent in the past three years no one answered 
the telephone at lyphomed headquarters saturday pharmaceutical 
companies have said that the rapid expansion of knowledge about 
aids makes research and development of drugs expensive and 
speculative 
a single bottle of this drug about 300 milligrams costs 
129 said paul adams a spokesman for the protesters members of 
a group called chicago for aids rights or cfar which numbers its 
group at about 100 
organizers of the other demonstrations said they were affiliated 
with various local gay rights groups and with national coalitions 
going by the names actnow for aids coalition to network organize 
and win and actup for aids coalition to unleash power

the university of minnesotas interim 
president apologized saturday to the head of the schools board of 
regents after withdrawing as a candidate for president at another 
university amid plagiarism allegations 
board of regents chairman david lebedoff said interim president 
richard sauer called him to apologize for the incident in which 
sauer admitted lifting part of a presentation for the north dakota 
state university job from a magazine article without crediting it 
sauer has acknowledged that in a speech he has given several 
times in the past six weeks he failed to credit the article 
i got a phone call from mr sauer and he apologized in a very 
heartfelt manner for what he described as a bad mistake on his 
part lebedoff said 
sauer called the lack of attribution a dumb thing to do 
i made a mistake of poor judgment in retrospect and i 
apologize for that he said i dont think i explicitly said 
they were my words but i used them as an example of points to 
consider and i didnt cite the authors name 
asked if the incident could possibly lead to a call for sauer to 
step down as interim president lebedoff said i dont want to 
speculate on that 
regents and lawmakers interviewed by the associated press 
saturday said they had heard no calls for sauers resignation and 
expressed support for him 
the 48yearold sauer was vice president of agriculture 
forestry and home economics at the university before becoming 
interim president in march to replace kenneth keller keller 
resigned amid controversy over cost overruns to renovate the 
official residence of the university president and over a 200000 
renovation of his office suite 
sauer conceded friday night that he had failed to credit the 
article in the speech given at ndsu in fargo nd on monday but 
said he had not been trying to claim authorship 
he called william c nelson chairman of north dakota state 
universitys presidential search committee to say he was 
withdrawing from consideration according to nelson who said he 
unsuccessfully tried to get sauer to remain a candidate 
sauers speech was presented to several hundred professors 
faculty and students at a forum for the candidates history 
professor larry r peterson said he recognized part of the speech 
as being nearly identical to points made by cornell university 
president frank rhodes in the may 22 1985 edition of the 
chronicle of higher education 
he said he forwarded the information to the presidential search 
committee 
however the committee on thursday recommended sauer and three 
others to the north dakota board of higher education after 
accepting sauers explanation that he accidentally omitted the 
credit in trying to shorten his speech nelson said

jurors spent a fourth day deliberating 
whether wayne carl coleman should be executed for killing six 
family members but adjourned saturday without reaching a decision 
a rare sunday session was ordered by superior judge hugh lawson 
with some participants in the case predicting deliberations could 
continue into next week 
earlier saturday lawson issued a partial recharge to the 
jurors telling them they should each listen to the views of the 
others the jury room is no place for the championship of causes 
on either side of the issue a juror should not be an advocate 
the retrial jury which found coleman guilty of six counts of 
murder on monday began deliberating his sentence wednesday 
afternoon 
lawson has given no indication when he might halt the 
deliberations if the jury does not decide unanimously for his 
execution coleman whose original death sentence for the 1973 
slayings was overturned on appeal will be sentenced to life in 
prison 
legal experts are divided on whether coleman who has served 15 
years from his original conviction would be immediately eligible 
for parole consideration 
indications that the sequestered jurors were having difficulty 
reaching a verdict surfaced wednesday evening when they reported 
they were not close to completing their task on thursday a female 
juror sent lawson a note telling him she had made up her mind and 
wouldnt change it that juror nodded repeatedly friday as lawson 
reviewed the law regarding mitigating circumstances that might 
justify a decision to spare his life 
coleman carl isaacs and george elder dungee were convicted of 
murder and sentenced to death in 1974 for the may 14 1973 
killings of ned alday his brother aubrey neds sons jimmy jerry 
and chester and jerrys wife mary the five men were shot one by 
one in jerry aldays mobile home in rural seminole county mary 
alday was killed in a nearby field after she was repeatedly raped 
the convictions were overturned by a federal appeals court in 
1985 because of excessive pretrial publicity isaacs was convicted 
a second time and sentenced to death in january dungee is to be 
retried later in columbus

former gov reubin askews decision to 
pull out of the us senate race saturday sent several politicians 
scrambling because of the likely impact on senate gubernatorial 
and congressional races 
its a whole new ballgame state democratic chairman charles 
whitehead said saturday after askew made public a decision he had 
revealed to other politicians the night before everybody was 
burning up the phones last night 
following the equally surprising december decision of threeterm 
democratic sen lawton chiles not to run for reelection askew 
again deprived the the party of what it felt was a sure winner 
if there ever was a gimmie it was there whitehead said 
it was his race to lose 
the democratic nominee will likely face us rep connie mack 
iii the republican from cape coral is doing well raising money and 
can count on substantial help from the national republican party as 
it tries to regain a senate seat from florida after republican sen 
paula hawkins lost to thengov bob graham in 1986 
dan miller state president of the aflcio and active among 
state democrats called askews decision a real shame 
but its still a long season we have enough time miller 
said 
miller suggested that macks boost from the askew withdrawal may 
be shortlived 
i think paula hawkins and rep bill mccollum who both had 
considered running this year for the republican nomination stayed 
out because of reubin askew they may change their minds now 
miller said 
us rep kenneth buddy mackay of ocala was poised to jump 
into the democratic race which he had stayed out because of 
askews candidacy mackay who was endorsed by askew saturday 
scheduled a news conference for monday and was expected to pick up 
the support of askew backers he spent much of saturday telephoning 
askew supporters 
rep dan mica was the only announced democratic candidate 
remaining he spent saturday telephoning florida democrats from his 
washington office hoping to take advantage of his headstart in the 
democratic race 
mica has a strong southeastern florida base but some democrats 
here saturday speculated that another south florida congressman 
larry smith of hollywood or other candidates might consider 
joining the race 
other speculation as florida state party officials and activists 
met saturday to name atlarge delegates to the national 
presidential convention centered on the domino effect 
mackay was among leading democrats lining up for the right to 
challenge republican gov bob martinez in 1990 so his switch to 
the senate race could prompt others to join state sen george 
stuart of orlando the only announced candidate for governor 
the opening of mackays seat could make an opportunity for state 
house speaker jon mills to go to washington 
there also was speculation that the republicans improved 
chances of winning the senate seat in november would probably make 
national democrats reluctant to open up another senate seat by 
pushing for graham as a vice presidential nominee

a sevenyearold docudrama narrated by the 
late orson welles has many california residents panicked that an 
earthquake could reduce the city to rubble this week 
the hotselling 1981 videotape the man who saw tomorrow 
dramatically interprets a vague prediction in verse by the 
16thcentury seer nostradamus as proof that a planetary alignment 
will cause an earthquake to level los angeles sometime in may 
to make matters worse astrologers have further narrowed the 
prediction to say the quake is most likely to strike sometime this 
week possibly between sunday and thursday 
callers have clogged earthquake hotlines psychologists report 
an increase in patients anxieties moving companies have even 
transported a few desperate souls completely out of quakeprone 
california 
although many experts have called the film bunk and said there 
is no planetary alignment during may anxiety seems to be gaining 
momentum 
the phones are ringing pretty steadily said brenda searcy 
a nurse answering crisis line phones at charter hospital in long 
beach friday night 
theyre really panicking some of them are shaky and crying 
ms searcy said ive had a lot of parents call and say their 
children cant sleep at night because of the predictions 
ms searcy said she tells the callers the way i feel i dont 
believe there is going to be an earthquake 
the griffith observatory also established a hotline after 
workers found themselves fielding dozens of calls a day said 
program supervisor john e mosley 
the most common question when will the planets line up 
the answer there are no planetary alignments whatsoever in 
the month of may and even if there were such alignments have 
never been found to correspond to an earthquake mosley said 
people dont need to worry said stewart robb an anaheim 
calif author who has studied nostradamus prophesies for 48 years 
and has written five books on the french seer 
its not nostradamus its an orson welles movie i would 
go so far as to say that even if there were a big quake in may it 
would still not give credit to nostradamus 
nevertheless elaine young a beverly hills real estate agent 
said her company has gotten calls from those who want to lease 
their homes for the month 
we had some inquiries in april from people asking if they 
could be moved at the end of the month said office manager linda 
chavez of western mayflower moving company in suburban montebello 
they indicated they wanted to move because they feared the coming 
quake 
the fears have been a boon to some 
ron burke marketing manager for the sparkletts drinking water 
company said sales of containers designed to be stored for 
earthquakes increased 500 percent during april 
and extendalife a pasadena disaster supply company reported a 
10fold increase in sales last week of such things as purified 
water survival cookie bars firstaid kits and thermal blankets

about 6000 cuban exiles marched through the little 
havana section of miami on saturday to protest the possibility of 
normalized relations between the us government and fidel castros 
communist regime 
exiles waved the cuban flag sang their homelands national 
anthem and spoke out against any formal relations with castros 
government 
for 30 years the policy of the united states has been not to 
send its people to cuba because of the human rights position 
there said rafael penalver leader of the task force of cuban 
civic organizations nothing has changed and opening up 
relations will not change cuba 
cubanamerican leaders longtime supporters of the reagan 
administration say they feel betrayed by secret meetings of us 
and cuban officials last year that resulted in a renewed 
immigration pact 
the leaders say such discussions legitimize the castro regime 
and could be a move toward formal ties between the two countries 
organizers of the march said more protests will be held unless 
the us government changes its position

the leader of a sixday strike at the 
lenin shipyard said saturday that management generally agreed to 
pay increases reinstate fired activists and grant an amnesty for 
strikers sources said 
strike committee chairman alojzy szablewski emerged from three 
hours of talks saturday evening smiling broadly and calling the 
negotiations a big step forward 
according to witnesses he told the strikers that management in 
principle accepted the committees demands to increase pay at least 
38 a month reinstate fired solidarity activists and grant amnesty 
for the approximately 1000 strikers occupying the plant 
three deputy directors of the shipyard taking part in the talks 
refused to discuss demands for legalization of a solidarity local 
at the shipyard and freedom for political prisoners saying those 
issues were outside their competence szablewski said 
a 15minute audio broadcast by solidarity the illegal trade 
federation broke into the communist governments television news 
at 930 pm in gdansk solidarity founder lech walesa could be 
heard telling strikers you are to decide whether we accept or 
fight for solidarity its your decision in the case of a 
pacification raid ill be the last to leave the shipyard 
the speech was taped at a rally in the shipyard after the talks 
and broadcast a short time later solidarity sources said 
management already had expressed willingness in talks with the 
official union to raise wages by about 38 a month but it is the 
first time management has engaged in talks with the unofficial 
strike committee and according to the sources made the promise 
directly to the strikers 
the staterun news agency pap filed a report saying no agreement 
was reached but that talks were to continue sunday 
it said the shipyard was planning to raise pay by an unspecified 
amount june 1 and quoted a prosecutor as saying strikers who give 
up peacefully would not be arrested and that management said 
strikers would not be fired 
the pap account made no mention of agreement to reinstate 
solidarity activists 
polishborn pope john paul ii on a visit of south america said 
saturday that his countrymen are justified in striking he said the 
heart of polands crisis is the lack of true democracy 
representatives of the roman catholic church mediated the talks 
at the shipyards main office building sources said 
walesa did not participate in the talks 
piotr konopka an aide to walesa said the meeting was important 
because it meant the authorities had recognized that the strike 
committee represented shipyard workers 
saturdays meeting was the first of its kind since the shipyard 
strike began monday in two weeks of labor upheaval that has been 
the worst in poland since the 1981 military crackdown 
riot police surrounded the yard thursday prompting fears that 
they would storm the shipyard like they did the nowa huta steel 
mill in krakow on thursday 
those fears diminished on saturday according to a strikers 
communique issued from the shipyard 
the shipyard is still isolated from the city but there is no 
feeling of siege the communique said 
bishop tadeusz goclowski of gdansk who was instrumental in 
arranging the talks said he was convinced that a solution 
without use of force is possible 
indeed konopka said the chief of security forces for gdansk 
internal affairs gen jerzy andrzejewski had guaranteed the 
strikers safety for the time being 
in addition a church source in warsaw said the church had 
received a promise that the strikers remaining in the shipyard who 
have not received food supplies since thursday would get food 
there also were attempts under way to allow strikers to see their 
families 
inside the shipyard the atmosphere is very good they feel 
they are on a piece of free polish land konopka said 
adam michnik a senior opposition activist said the talks 
proved the road of dialogue is possible 
earlier michnik had said he believed polish authorities would 
force the strike to end by starving the workers 
solidarity contends the trade federation outlawed following the 
december 1981 martial law crackdown should be legalized and 
allowed to join in a dialogue to solve polands pressing economic 
and social problems 
also on saturday two solidarity members were sentenced to jail 
for union activities 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz was sentenced 
to six weeks in prison in connection with interviews he gave to 
western media 
onyszkiewicz was sentenced in warsaw on a charge of 
disseminating false information aimed at sparking arrest in 
gdansk czeslaw nowak a solidarity dockworker activist was 
sentenced to three months 
the sentences followed fridays sentencing of bogdan lis 
regional head of solidarity for gdansk to three months in prison 
they were the harshest imposed on solidarity members for union 
activities since a 1986 political amnesty 
official pressure on solidarity has stepped up since a wave of 
at least five strikes hit the country beginning april 25 
besides the lenin shipyard strike there was a 10day strike by 
steelworkers in southern poland oneday bus driver strikes in 
bydgoszcz and szczecin and a twoday strike by workers at the heavy 
machinery plant in stalowa wola in southwest poland 
a communique issued saturday by the shipyard strikers before the 
talks described their mood as calm although not joyful 
strikers main problem was lack of food cigarettes hygiene 
and bad weather it said skies were overcast and cool friday 
but improved somewhat saturday 
the communique made no mention of a suicide attempt friday by 
one young striker after the attempt walesa gave a moralebuilding 
talk and the strikers took steps to organize themselves more 
effectively 
prices in poland have risen 42 percent price so far this year as 
part of the governments austerity program 
in washington deputy secretary of state john c whitehead 
denounced the crackdown on strikers and said us backing for 
polands economic recovery plan will remain frozen until the 
program wins popular support

the freighter struck the span 
there were no injuries among the 27member crew 
the coast guard is investigating the whole collision said 
ensign glena hermes once they find out the who and the what 
they will be able to tell the how and the why until then the cause 
is pure speculation 
in the worst case 20 to 30 ships that travel lake michigan and 
make deliveries via the calumet river could be barred while the 
steel mess is sorted out said coast guard lt chris boegel 
the cleanup could take only two days or as long as a month he 
said 
this is discouraging for them boegel added referring to 
shippers this bridge is blocking the entrance of the harbor from 
lake michigan thats where they drop off their steel 
the illinois international port district also known as the port 
of chicago is near the illinoisindiana border in an gritty 
industrial area with both shuttered and thriving steel plants 
the baltimore amp ohio railroad bridge is tangled with the 
pondokratis a ship registered in cyprus as the freighter was 
heading through the river channel to lake michigan the ship 
traveled a few more yards pulling the massive span with it 
the ship had just unloaded steel and was bound for duluth minn

a federal judge has frozen the assets of an 
illinoisbased group of art galleries accused of selling 50 
posters at prices up to 5000 and calling them handsigned 
limitededition prints by wellknown artists 
us district judge prentice marshall has ordered austin 
galleries not to represent the posters as handsigned works by 
pablo picasso salvador dali marc chagall and other painters 
marshall issued the order after receiving a complaint from the 
federal trade commission the ftc said austin galleries sold the 
posters as original lithographs when in fact the artist was not 
involved in the production of the works 
donald austin president of the galleries denied the accusation 
in a statement saying his businesses have sold the prints based on 
information from suppliers 
we believe that everything we have is authentic until proven 
different stanley j adelman a lawyer for the galleries said 
saturday even art experts differ on how much control an artist 
must have of a print before it is considered a limitededition 
issue he said 
the frames are worth more than the prints said san 
francisco district attorney arlo smith who is assisting with the 
investigation 
the ftc also asked the court to issue a permanent order against 
any misrepresentations in the sale of the artwork and to order the 
company to make restitution to customers the order freezes the 
companys assets and allows ftc attorneys to inspect gallery 
records 
austin galleries headquartered in suburban palatine has about 
eight outlets in illinois and california adelman said 
the prints were sold at prices ranging from 200 to 5000 
we rely upon our suppliers to authenticate these works and 
im more interested than anyone that what we buy and sell is 
authentic said austin 
he said that in more than 20 years in the art field neither 
austin galleries nor he has ever been involved in any lawsuit 
even remotely suggesting that the works of art sold by us are 
anything other than what they are represented to be 
it is company policy to give a refund if a customer secures a 
written opinion from a recognized art expert that a print is 
not authentic said austin 
adelman said the business would cooperate fully with the 
government

a 25 million luxury yacht was seized saturday 
after a us coast guard search turned up bits of marijuana on 
board 
less than onetenth of an ounce of marijuana was found in a 
trash can dresser and in the state room of the 133foot ark royal 
boarded in the yucatan channel between mexico and cuba said coast 
guard spokesman luis diaz 
the seizure was the most extreme example yet of the reagan 
administrations new zero tolerance policy in applying laws 
permitting confiscation of ships and vehicles used to transport 
illegal drugs 
its the largest in terms of size and by far the most 
expensive and luxurious vessel weve seized under this policy 
diaz said adding that 12 boats have been seized since april 11 
tractortrailers have been seized along the canadian border under a 
similar program 
the coast guard cutter tampa stopped the yacht saturday morning 
to check paperwork and safety equipment diaz said 
just by accident one of the officers spotted the marijuana in 
the trash can and that prompted a thorough search of every corner 
of the vessel he said 
the seized yacht was being brought to key west saturday night 
along with the six people on board who will probably not be 
charged diaz said 
we have been focusing all our efforts in recent years on just 
the big smugglers but drugs are a twoway street diaz said 
this is the time were making the users pay it really has to 
hurt to see a luxury yacht taken away for what basically amounts to 
one joint 
under the tougher reagan administration policy a seized boat 
must be returned to its owners only if allegations of illegal drugs 
on board are proved to be false otherwise the boat is turned over 
to us customs which can sell it at auction

raleigh nc ap veteran newsman and grammarian edwin newman 
told graduates of north carolina state university saturday that 
inflated language and poor grammar are dragging down the united 
states 
speaking at a football stadium where three days earlier the rock 
group pink floyd sang we dont need no education newman said 
americans have become addicted to mush to smog to dull 
pompous boneless gassy language 
its a grave handicap since there is a direct connection 
between the skill and the efficiency with which a nation uses its 
language and its ability to compete in the modern world said 
newman 
meanwhile mary hatwood futrell president of the national 
education association gave the reagan administration an fplus 
for its efforts on behalf of education children and young people 
and the only reason they get the plus is because congress 
time after time voted against the administration and said 
the children of america are too important for us to do what you 
want us to do she told the 630 graduates of north carolina 
central university in durham

all the material goods it buys wont necessarily make one feel

the united states is moving towards the 
announcement of a multibilliondollar international aid program to 
help the beleaguered government of philippines president corazon 
aquino a us official said saturday 
the program which has been likened by congressional proponents 
to the 1947 marshall plan that rescued west europe after world war 
ii could lead to an international appeal for 10 billion over the 
next five years said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
president reagan also plans to send a highlevel special 
emissary to the philippines to dramatize his concern about 
conditions in that nation the washington post reported in its 
sunday editions 
the newspaper said the emissary perhaps accompanied by senior 
members of congress would be sent to manila to deliver a signal of 
toplevel support and to consult with aquino and her government on 
details of the program 
an american with international standing also may be picked to 
coordinate the program according to the post the newspaper quoted 
sources as saying neither the special emissary nor the coordinator 
has been chosen 
the major elements of the program the post said are us 
grants beginning in fiscal 1990 loans for development purposes 
debt relief in the form of reductions in scheduled payments and 
debtequity swaps trade preferences to encourage philippine 
exports and investments from international financial institutions 
and private business 
the post citing unidentified sources said 10 billion in new 
aid over a fiveyear period has been discussed as the working 
target within the administration and congress 
assistant secretary of defense richard l armitage in march said 
japan south korea australia and possibly the major european 
allies would be asked to help finance the plan he said secretary 
of state george p shultz had met with congressional members to 
discuss the plan but that no total sum or concrete initiative 
emerged 
last november four lawmakers proposed that the united states 
create a marshall plan for the philippines to assist the nation in 
overcoming its severe economic problems 
the proposal to reagan from sens alan cranston dcalif and 
richard lugar rind and reps stephen solarz dny and jack 
kemp rny was for worldwide assistance to the philippines of 1 
billion yearly for five years over the amounts already being spent 
us assistance to the philippines is about 400 million a year 
currently of which 180 million is paid for clark air base and the 
subic bay navy base the two largest american military bases 
outside the united states

democratic candidate jesse jackson 
appealing for the support of californias large hispanic 
population on saturday proposed extending the immigrant amnesty 
law for a year and moving the eligibility deadline from 1982 to 
january 1987 
the presidential contender also said the employer sanctions in 
the new immigration legislation should be repealed as 
discriminatory against workers and a burden to employers 
meanwhile jacksons chief rival for the party nomination 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis took a break from campaigning 
to work on gubernatorial business and have a private weekend with 
his wife kitty 
vice president george bush who has sewn up the republican 
nomination also spent the weekend at home in the nations capital 
bush continued to come under fire from jackson for calling the 
preacherturnedpolitician a hustler from chicago despite 
assurances from the vice presidents campaign staff that there was 
nothing derogatory in his comments 
i do not know why he would lash out at me jackson said 
prior to marching in the cinco de mayo parade as the events grand 
marshal he has a tendency when he panics to reach out and 
attack 
asked if this indicated how bush as president would act under 
stress jackson responded we would be at national risk if he 
were in that position this tendency to be meanspirited to curse 
at and to name call is a habit a behavior pattern one who has 
this office must have a sense of stability and security 
bush told a group of republicans in lincoln neb on friday 
im not going to be outhustled by the hustler from chicago or 
from that traditional liberal democrat from massachusetts 
stephen hart a spokesman for bush said the vice president 
was talking about how hard he jackson has hustled 
in california where about onesixth of the voting age 
population is hispanic jackson spoke to a breakfast meeting of the 
latino issues forum telling about 150 hispanic leaders that the 
phrase illegal aliens should apply to et the extraterrestial 
but not to human beings 
people fleeing war or fleeing poverty should not be locked up 
for the crime of wanting to be part of us he said 
under the new federal immigration legislation the deadline 
passed last week for undocumented workers who have been in the 
united states since 1982 to apply for legal resident status 
employers who hire workers who do not have legal status are subject 
to sanctions 
the jackson campaign cited steve teichner poll figures from may 
2 showing jackson and frontrunner dukakis neckandneck in the 
race for hispanic votes in california hich holds its primary june 
7 with 314 delegates at stake 
but dukakis has proven popular among the nations hispanics 
because of his fluency in spanish he has targeted the latin 
population by speaking spanish in television ads 
jackson is strongest among urban hispanics in the los angeles 
and san francisco bay areas and weakest among those in orange 
county and the laborers of the san joaquin agricultural valley of 
central california 
jackson later saturday addressed a gay rights rally of about 
4000 people outside the state capitol in sacramento and lashed out 
at a california ballot measure that calls for a quarantine of aids 
victims 
he called it a hatebased measure backed by supporters of 
political extremist lyndon larouche and said shame on us for 
entertaining such an idea 
jackson flew back to southern california for a fundraiser in 
san dimas before heading to greensboro nc to speak sunday at 
the college graduation of his two sons 
in illinois backers of jackson and paul simon called a truce in 
their squabble over the states atlarge delegates to the national 
convention as party leaders elected a unity slate of 47 
delegates for the illinois senator and 13 for jackson 
simon who received the bulk of the states atlarge delegates 
with his victory in illinois march 15 primary suspended his 
presidential campaign last month that tactic angered supporters of 
jackson who finished second in illinois and would have collected 
all of the states atlarge delegates had simon dropped out 
overall simon has 148 of illinois 187 democratic delegates 
while jackson has 41 
in wyoming dukakis gained two delegates at the state democratic 
convention for a total of seven delegates while tennessee sen 
albert gore jr held on to his six delegates despite the suspension 
of his campaign 
jackson picked up three delegates and two delegates remain 
uncommitted 
at the state convention in nevada dukakis gained three 
delegates for a total of 12 jackson gained one delegate for a 
total of four and gore lost one delegate leaving him with six one 
delegate remained uncommitted 
in alabama democrats held an executive committee meeting to 
finalize delegates to the national convention in atlanta july 
1821

glittering fairmont hotel voter registration dinner attended by 
about 1000 prominent state democrats financial supporters and 
celebrities including actor martin sheen and actress jane fonda 
and her husband assemblyman tom hayden of santa monica 
jackson attacking reagan administration economic policies 
urged party expansion to the common people on whose shoulders our 
victories always come 
jackson on the one hand made a plea for party unity but also 
warned that his constituency among these common people might 
abandon the democrats if their concerns are not addressed when 
they withdraw no one can win he said 
i really want to win in november but the party must win and 
the nation must be saved jackson said

a judge ruled friday that a special election 
should be held next year to choose a successor to the late mayor 
harold washington a decision that drew cheers from courtroom 
spectators 
cook county circuit judge eugene wachowski had to call for order 
to quell the jubilant reaction but a spokesman for the losing 
side which backs a 1991 election date vowed to appeal to the 
illinois supreme court 
alderman timothy evans an opponent of mayor eugene sawyer 
called the ruling a victory for the people of chicago asked 
whether hell be a candidate in the next election evans said 
youll have to tune in to see 
there was no immediate comment from sawyer who was not directly 
involved in the case mayoral spokesman monroe anderson was not in 
his office 
the city council chose sawyer over evans at a raucous allnight 
meeting a week after washington the citys first black mayor died 
of a heart attack nov 25 
though both evans and sawyer are black sawyer was elected 
primarily through the backing of the city councils oldguard white 
aldermen hundreds of washington and evans loyalists had thronged 
city hall protesting that backroom deals were cutting voters 
out of the decisionmaking process 
its a marvelous marvelous victory for all of those citizens 
who came down to la salle street and stood in the city hall 
rotunda imploring their aldermen to listen to them said a 
smiling evans as he emerged from fridays hearing 
in his ruling wachowski said he believed state law clearly 
granted the city board of elections commissioners authority to call 
a special election in the spring of 1989 as the board did earlier 
this week 
attorney russ stewart representing a group called united 
citizens of chicago and illinois had argued that sawyer was 
properly elected by the city council and should be allowed to serve 
until 1991 when washingtons second term would have ended the 
group denied any ties to sawyer 
but attorneys for a group calling itself the coalition to let 
the people decide in 1989 argued successfully that illinois law 
clearly requires a special election if a municipal officer dies or 
resigns with more than 28 months remaining in his or her term 
the question before you attorney tom johnson told the 
judge is whether the voters the people in the neighborhoods 
will have a chance to participate in deciding who will govern the 
city of chicago for the remainder of washingtons 48month term 
former gop mayoral candidate kenneth hurst president of the 
united citizens said he would appeal wachowskis decision he 
described his group as a nonpartisan watchdog organization seeking 
fair government 
alderman david orr who served briefly as interim mayor after 
washingtons death called the ruling a defeat for mayor sawyer 
in that he mistakenly let his followers say they favored 1991 
he let the public believe he preferred 1991 and i think that 
was a mistake because you never want to tell the public they dont 
have the right to choose who their leader will be orr said

a man who successfully used a 
makemyday defense in the killing of a neighbor was sentenced 
friday to life in prison for the murder of his estranged wife 
david guenther 35 who shot to death his wife pamela and 
wounded her boyfriend outside a restaurant last year cannot be 
considered for parole for 40 years district judge harlan bockman 
ruled 
guenther also was given a consecutive eightyear term for 
wounding stanley stinson 
as he left court and got into a police car guenther told 
reporters ill have another trial someday hopefully in about a 
year his lawyers have already planned an appeal 
stinson who attended the sentencing said he was angry that the 
parole restriction was not stiffer saying it should have been for 
at least 80 years 
in april 1986 guenther fatally shot one neighbor and wounded 
two other people in the climax to a neighborhood feud a judge 
ruled he acted lawfully under the states new make my day law 
which allows residents to use deadly force in their homes against 
intruders 
the name comes from a clint eastwood movie in which he plays a 
police officer who urges a criminal to shoot at him so hell have a 
reason to fire back eastwoods character says go ahead make my 
day 
however the colorado supreme court overturned that ruling and 
made guenther stand trial a jury acquitted him last october 
finding he acted in selfdefense 
but by then guenther was charged with killing his 30yearold 
wife and injuring stinson 
the guenthers children christopher 13 and jennifer 11 
witnessed the march 1 1987 shootings and were key prosecution 
witnesses 
disagreement at the trial was not over whether guenther fired 
the shots however the prosecution contended guenther acted with 
deliberation while the defense claimed guenther fired eights shots 
from his pistol in the heat of passion as he saw his wife 
kissing stinson 
prosecutors said the attack followed a sequence of threats and 
violence by guenther against mrs guenther who had taken the 
children and left him a month before she was killed

secretary of state george p shultz attacking 
two congressional actions on friday denounced a new south african 
sanctions proposal and called the trade bill one of those 
1000page monstrosities 
at a luncheon honoring former members of the foreign service 
shultz said the two measures were examples of what he called a 
disturbing new american trend toward insularity 
theres an instinct coming out in this country of stop the 
world i want to get off but we cant get off shultz said 
he said an omnibus trade bill passed by congress that president 
reagan has vowed to veto would protect american markets at a time 
when the us trade deficit is narrowing and the united states does 
not need to be shielded from foreign goods 
its ironic because we are the biggest exporters in the 
world shultz said 
its one of those 1000page monstrosities and you hardly dare 
say what is in it and whats not in it shultz said of the bill 
united states competitiveness is asserting itself and all the 
moonshine about how were flat on our backs and not able to do 
anything is shown to be just that he said 
in a slap at rep richard gephardt dmo a dropout in the race 
for the presidential nomination shultz said i was interested to 
see what happened to the candidate for president in the primaries 
who made protection his shining light he didnt get very far 
we cant let voices of discouragement and special interests 
lead us away from ideas that have worked in the past toward the 
ideas that have failed in the past shultz said 
the secretary repeated administration assertions that a bill to 
increase sanctions to pressure south africa to end its restrictive 
racial policies would be counterproductive because it would cut the 
united states ability to influence that government constructively 
shultz said if we see something we dont like we have a 
tendency to say lets get out of there 
the instinct of it is to say we dont like apartheid 
therefore lets throw up our hands and leave thats not the 
american instinct of the old days he said 
legislation to toughen sanctions against south africa was 
approved tuesday by the house foreign affairs committee and appears 
to have widespread support in the democraticcontrolled house it 
faces strong republican opposition and could undergo changes in the 
gopdominated senate 
shultz also railed against foreign aid and operations budget 
cuts instituted by congress over his objections one of the 
programs to be hurt will be us aid to afghan refugees 
where were going to find funds for that is beyond me 
shultz said were broke the countrys going great but the 
governments broke and our foreign affairs picture is broke

the marine corps under orders to allow women 
to work as embassy security guards has accepted its first group of 
women into a training school after failing to generate much 
immediate interest 
according to a spokesman for the corps only six female marines 
applied by the deadline to enter the next class at the marine 
security guard school at quantico va which begins on may 17 
of those six applicants five have been accepted lt col 
john shotwell the spokesman said friday 
shotwell said the five female marines would join 150 enlisted 
men in the next class 
he declined to say whether the corps was surprised or 
disappointed with the low turnout of female applicants but noted 
there had been little advance notice of the change in policy 
regarding security guards 
the announcement was made during the first week of april and 
the deadline for applications was may 1 shotwell said 
the marine corps has maintained a strict menonly policy 
regarding embassy security guards ever since it ended an experiment 
with female guards in 1979 fifteen women were assigned to foreign 
posts during that brief pilot program which was discontinued after 
attacks on embassies in pakistan and iran 
the commandant of the marines gen alfred m gray has made it 
plain in recent months he would prefer to maintain the maleonly 
policy because he wants combatready marines serving in the jobs 
and combat jobs arent open to women 
grays objections were overridden three months ago however by 
defense secretary frank c carlucci who heeded the recommendation 
of an advisory panel and ordered the positions opened that move 
was part of a campaign by civilian officials at the pentagon to 
counter criticism that the military services are discriminating 
against women in job opportunities and doing too little to stop 
sexual harassment 
there are currently about 1400 marines serving in the embassy 
security force guarding 140 posts in 127 countries the guard 
force became the object of unwanted publicity a year ago because of 
a spyandsex scandal involving marines in moscow 
gray and the marine corps leadership so far have refused to say 
how many of the embassy guard positions will be opened to women 
citing the need to study everything from available housing to the 
threat of terrorism and cultural considerations 
there was no quota for female applicants in the first 
class shotwell said each applicant was judged on his or her 
own merits as to whether well see more applications in the 
future i wont speculate

a federal judge rejecting a legal challenge by 
gov michael s dukakis ruled friday that congress and the 
president can order national guard troops to go on training 
missions over a governors objections 
the ruling the second by a us district court answering recent 
challenges to federal authority apparently will force the 
frontrunner for the democratic presidential nomination to send a 
massachusetts contingent of 13 public relations officers to 
honduras and panama later this month 
dukakis a critic of reagan administration policy in central 
america had filed suit trying to block the twoweek assignment 
he said in a statement that he would appeal the decision 
contending the reagan administration is using national guard 
training in central america as part of its illadvised and illegal 
strategy to overthrow the nicaraguan government 
however the governor is not seeking a stay of the ruling 
pending appeal 
the real issue here is not the sending of public relations 
people to honduras press secretary james dorsey said the much 
larger issue is the overridinig constitutional issue and sending 
troops down there as a destabilizing policy what you need to 
obtain a stay is to demonstrate that irreparable harm would occur 
no one is going to be foolish enough to say this would cause 
irreparable harm 
us district judge robert keeton in the opinion upholding the 
federal department of defense said federal authorities have the 
power to give orders to national guard members because the troops 
are sworn to federal duty as well as state duty 
lawyers for the justice department had argued that the army 
clause in the constitution gives congress the ultimate say over 
the nations entire military apparatus 
the massachusetts attorney generals office representing 
dukakis had contended the militia clause reserved power to the 
governors over training the militia 
under the militia act of 1792 keeton wrote virtually 
every ablebodied man between 18 and 45 was enrolled in the militia 
and required to arm himself at his own expense this statute was 
the only permanent legislation organizing the militia for over 100 
years 
but in the 20th century that status changed he said with the 
key step being a 1933 law that made the national guard a permanent 
part of the us army through the device of dual enlistment 
citing previous federal court rulings from the vietnam era 
keeton said congress had the power under the constitution to pass 
the 1933 law

key witnesses in a suit accusing contras and us 
officials of running a gunsfordrugs smuggling ring have been 
threatened with prosecution to block damaging revelations about 
vice president george bush attorneys charged friday 
bush head of the cia in 1976 allegedly allowed some of the 
suits defendants including his covert operations chief theodore 
shackley to set up an underground secret team to hide their 
activities from the incoming carter administration said 
plaintiffs attorney daniel sheehan 
they were running covert operations for bush sheehan told 
us district judge james king then they set up an offtheshelf 
operation 
sheehan said an effort to intimidate witnesses and cripple the 
suit has prevented revelations that could hurt bush in his 
presidential campaign 
but defense attorney theodore klein who represents three of the 
29 defendants dismissed the bushcia conection as a ploy by 
sheehan saying sheehan cannot provide a single witness to 
prove the case 
i dont know where george bush comes in all of a sudden 
klein told the judge i think it bears witness to their political 
motivation 
the arguments came up during a hearing on the case which has a 
june 29 trial date the plaintiffs made a number of requests which 
the judge took under advisement and is expected to rule on next 
week 
the 24 million damage and racketeering suit charges that the 
defendants including indicted irancontra figures richard secord 
and albert hakim supplied the contras with weapons in trade for 
cocaine through a secret illegal network the suit also accuses the 
group of planning the may 1984 bombing that injured maverick rebel 
leader eden pastora in nicaragua 
sheehan works for the liberal washingtonbased christic 
institute which represents the plaintiffs journalists tony 
avirgan and martha honey avirgan was slightly injured in the 1984 
bombing 
sheehans assistant lewis pitts said that when he tried to 
interview mercenary jack terrell and others about the smuggling 
operation they told him they had been threatened with indictment 
if they gave any statements 
fbi agents and a miami grand jury were used to silence these 
little people to interfere with the investigation pitts told 
the judge we have concerns about political factors affecting 
judicial decisions 
thomas spencer attorney for former maj gen john k singlaub 
attacked the plaintiffs for failing to stick to the point of the 
suit damages to avirgan and honey 
they are attempting to use this forum to launch their 
political arguments said spencer 
pitts argued that the judge could grant immunity to the 
plaintiffs witnesses usually only a prerogative of prosecutors 
but klein said such an order violated the constitutional separation 
of powers 
sheehan sought the right to depose witnesses going back for a 
10year period including the time bush was head of the cia 
instead of the four years as king initially granted the judge 
warned that the trial was unlikely to be delayed 
king denied discussing the suit with us district judge gerhard 
gesell who is handling the irancontra criminal cases in 
washington gesell had said in court he would not allow the civil 
suit to interfere with the criminal cases against oliver north and 
the other irancontra defendants

hundreds of thousands of bottles of humco 
brand syrup of ipecac possibly containing a deadly poison remain 
in american homes the food and drug administration said friday 
as many as 400000 1ounce bottles labeled ipecac may actually 
contain oil of eucalyptus which could prove fatal if given to 
children the fda said 
ipecac normally is used to induce vomiting in children who are 
suspected of having eaten some dangerous product 
larry copeland general manager at humco laboratory inc in 
texarkana texas said friday evening that the fda was overstating 
the case by indicating that 400000 bottles are at risk 
we have sold close to 400000 bottles since february of 1987 
but there was only one lot in which five bottles of eucalyptus oil 
were mislabeled as ipecac syrup copeland said in a telephone 
interview thats all thats been found and thats all that were 
aware of at this time 
copeland who identified that lot number is 2804 said the 
company is recalling all lot numbers of the 1ounce containers of 
ipecac syrup only to make everybody feel safer about it 
the fda initially announced a recall of the humco brand ipecac 
april 29 after the label mixup was discovered however since 
then it has learned that thousands of bottles of the product have 
been distributed to consumers across the country as part of poison 
prevention week activities 
finding and returning those bottles is vital the fda says so 
that parents will not forget and accidentally give some of the 
eucalyptus oil to a child 
eucalyptus oil is used in minute amounts in vaporizers but if 
taken internally it can cause convulsions and coma officials said 
as little as a teaspoonful could prove fatal fda reported

the owner of a boat service catering to 
disabled and elderly people is battling federal officials who say 
motorized craft arent allowed in a popular wilderness recreation 
area 
im going to win because i have the law on my side said 
dave kromer who owns and operates dawn to dusk pontoon services 
he says his motorized pontoon boat is the only way that the 
handicapped would be able to see the boundary waters canoe area 
kromer 39 took his 18foot boat onto fall lake on thursday and 
intentionally crossed the line where the millionacre wilderness 
area begins setting up a legal battle over its use 
the federally protected wilderness area on the canadian border 
is popular with canoeists and other aficionados of outdoor 
recreation 
when kromer entered the area us forest service officials 
tagged him with a citation requiring that he either pay a 100 fine 
or go to court in which case he faces a maximum fine of 500 and 
six months in jail if he loses kromer said he will go to court 
nonetheless 
the seniors and the disabled have the right to visit this 
area kromer said the forest service is cutting down on that 
theyre saying the disabled cant go in there if theyre not 
physically able thats really sad 
but a us forest service official said he believes few people 
want kromers boat in the wilderness and that special provisions 
shouldnt be made for the handicapped 
we believe the law is very very clear said jack blackwell 
recreational staff officer for the us forest service in duluth 
the handicapped do not get a special exemption they are to take 
the wilderness as it is 
use of pontoon boats within the wilderness area is not an 
acceptable form of transportation up there blackwell said 
we dont feel any animosity toward mr kromer if he wants to 
test us thats fine and dandy we believe that the overwhelming 
majority of people here dont want to see pontoon boats up here 
while federal law allows only canoes and other paddleonly 
watercraft on about 90 percent of the water in the wilderness area 
fall and basswood are part of a chain of lakes where certain 
motorized watercraft are allowed 
the law does not specifically list pontoon boats though 
blackwell said 
last summer kromer got to make 25 trips to the basswood lake 
while his request for a permit to use the pontoon boat was pending 
but the forest service eventually rejected the request saying 
the companys motorized pontoon boat is incompatible with the 
surrounding wilderness and is bigger than most boats in the area

250 ufo experts and people who claim to have been abducted by 
extraterrestrials 
i was immobilized i couldnt move and i didnt think to 
speak i just watched said berte of a warm night on dec 10 
1979 when she says she was awakened on a friends porch in rhode 
island and carried in a paralyzed state aboard an alien spacecraft 
berte tells of observing a small threefingered alien in an 
incubator and being brought to a glassenclosed platform 
overlooking a table where her friend lay with a tube extending from 
her navel 
it makes you very angry said berte they dont ask your 
permission they just take you away 
arthur myers a conference coordinator and member of a church 
group interested in the paranormal said the gathering is one of 
the first public meetings of people claiming to have had close 
encounters of the third kind 
it reminds me a lot of alcholism or homosexuals coming out of 
the closet said myers theres a stigma attached to the 
abductees but once someone comes forward with their story others 
are willing to speak 
marianne shenefield of agawam is one of those yearning to let 
people know about her two experiences thirtyfive years ago she 
was an 11yearold girl building a tree house in agawam on a july 
afternoon 
then i turned around and there was what i thought was a little 
boy in a scuba outfit said shenefield then i felt this 
floating sensation and the next thing i knew i was in this round 
craft 
shenefield said the aliens put her under an xray device and she 
was observed by several aliens who tried to communicate with her 
by a soundmaking unit 
in 1972 shenefield said a femalelike alien captured her 
outside her home and brought her into a small compartment 
shenefield said she was released hours later dazed but unharmed 
a degenerative eye disorder has reduced her sight to dim shadows 
and bold streaks of light but the ailment enables her to see 
auras she said 
i can immediately detect someone who has been abducted she 
said they are surrounded by an indescribable color believe me 
i can tell 
author ray fowler said about 80 percent of all ufo sightings can 
be explained 
but there are those instances that defy any explanation 
said the former air force intelligence officer a keynote speaker 
at the conference saturday 
its imperative that we study these things with an open mind 
not gullibly accept them or reject them out of hand there are too 
many people who come forward with nothing to gain and everything to 
lose 
fowler whose book the andreasson affair describes a 
familys encounter with aliens said he became interested in ufos 
after seeing flying discs in 1947 
he is director of the mutual ufo network an international group 
that documents ufo sightings

the crew of a jumbo jet that landed monday in 
japan with only one of four engines operating could have used a 
backup system for correcting such failures united airlines said 
friday 
pending completion of an investigation by the airline and the 
national transportation safety board the planes cockpit crew has 
been grounded in what united described as a routine action in such 
cases 
flight 97 carrying 258 people from los angeles to japan landed 
safety at tokyos narita airport with three engines empty of fuel 
said united spokesman rob doughty 
the fourth engine had 24700 pounds of fuel considerably more 
than the federal landing requirement of 18400 pounds on such 
flights he said 
the chicagobased carrier said it had completed tests on the 
boeing 747 and discovered that failure of a valve on one fuel tank 
would have prevented the crew from using normal procedures to fuel 
the engines but found no mechanical problem with the backup system 
the alternate method was tested and there was no problem 
doughty said there are always two parts of the investigation of 
this type first the mechanical part which weve concluded and 
secondly the human part which will now be looked into 
air line pilots association spokesman hank krakowski said we 
usually dont comment until the investigation is complete 
ntsb spokesman allan pollock also said he would not comment 
while the investigation was under way 
the pilot had reported losing power in the first engine over the 
pacific about 1 hour 15 minutes from tokyo a second engine 30 
minutes later and a third engine just before landing

the wife of the black official 
slain in the sharpeville six case died last month after her 
release from a mental hospital said a government statement issued 
friday 
the statement regarding the death of councilor jacob dhlaminis 
wife alice appeared aimed at countering a wave of criticism of 
south africa that followed the conviction of the sharpeville six on 
charges of complicity in dhlaminis slaying they were sentenced to 
hang 
there has been an international campaign appealing for clemency 
the statement attributed to concerned residents said mrs 
dhlamini became unstable after the 1984 killing and was placed in a 
mental hospital in june 1987 she was released several weeks later 
and died in april it said leaving behind three children who 
once had a bright future in a happy and talented parental home 
the bureau for information said the statement was written by 
local officials and based on remarks by elderly residents of 
sharpeville the black township where dhlamini was killed by a mob 
during riots in 1984 
the executions of the sharpeville six five men and a woman 
have been stayed while defense lawyers apply to reopen the trial to 
consider claims that a state witness was coerced by police 
the six were not accused of contributing physically to 
dhlaminis death they were convicted under the doctrine of 
common purpose which holds them responsible because they were 
part of the mob 
the government has argued the sharpeville six are being 
misrepresented abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law 
authorities say evidence at the trial showed each contributed to 
the killing through such alleged actions as making firebombs to 
burn dhlaminis house and slapping a woman who pleaded for his life 
dlhaminis brother sello has been threatened by people 
demanding that he sign a statement asking that the sharpeville six 
not be hanged the statement said 
the statement also described jacob dhlamini as having an 
absolute sense of justice and said he had tried to resolve 
grievances over the rent increases that triggered the 1984 riots

a superior court judge friday refused a

of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
defense attorney michael scott had asked judge michael d ryan 
for the delay to give him more time to prepare and to allow an 
appeals court to rule on a request for a dismissal of the charges 
on grounds of selective prosecution 
scott has argued that gov rose mofford and former school 
superintendent carolyn warner mechams democratic opponent in 
1986 had made similar omissions from their financial disclosure 
statements and had not been charged 
assistant attorney general barnett lotstein said that both women 
are under investigation and he opposed any delay

statistics said joan claybrook who headed the national highway

view 
the department in a report presented to congress on friday

traffic fatality increases on rural interstate highways having the 
higher speed limit and those retaining the 55 mph national speed 
limit adopted in 1974

for berlin philharmonic fans legendary conductor 
herbert von karajan may have called in sick once too often 
the orchestras conductor for life said he had an intestinal 
flu and couldnt conduct a heavily advertised berlin concert on 
april 24 
a day later he flew off to japan for a 10day tour with the 
orchestra raising cries of protest sparking letters to the editor 
and infuriating west berlin officials who help bankroll the famed 
musicians 
leading the charge against the 80yearold maestro was city 
culture affairs chief volker hassemer who vowed to probe the 
incident 
gerhard heldt orchestra spokesman declined comment on the 
dispute adding that there would be nothing to say until after the 
orchestra returns from japan 
as for obtaining comment from karajan heldt said in a telephone 
interview you can say it is impossible to reach him now 
starting in the fall of 1986 a severe viral infection kept 
karajan off the berlin philharmonic podium for four months and 
also forced him to stay home when the orchestra toured the united 
states and japan 
karajan has suffered many medical problems in recent years 
including severe back pains that have forced him to cancel 
conducting appearances 
however michael dieterici a spokesman for the citys culture 
affairs chief said karajan also had called off appearances with 
the berlin philharmonic two or three times in the past under 
questionable circumstances 
he noted for example that during a tour of west germany last 
november karajan announced he couldnt mount the podium in 
duesseldorf because he said he had food poisoning from eating 
tainted fish karajan later changed his mind and performed but 
called off his appearance in stuttgart during the same tour 
dieterici said officials plan to discuss the matter with karajan 
we want to point out to him that there is a contract calling 
for a certain number of concerts each year dieterici said in an 
interview we want to make sure that he sticks to that contract 
as much as his health allows 
dieterici says the berlin contract calls for karajan to conduct 
about a dozen concerts a year 
the west berlin city administration gives the berlin 
philharmonic 25 million a year in subsidies for its various 
activities however dieterici said he didnt know how much goes 
directly to karajan 
both der spiegel magazine of hamburg and berlins tagespiegel 
newspaper recently have carried lengthy reports about enormous sums 
of money karajans agents allegedly demanded last year for a 
concert tour to taiwan the taiwanese later withdrew the idea 
reportedly because of the money involved 
berlins leftistleaning taz newspaper said recently karajan 
loves the japanese they gladly buy up his cds compact discs and 
his music videos 
but the berliners also love herbert they dont always want to 
drive to salzburg for him the newspaper added karajan is also 
renowned for the annual summer musical festival he leads in 
salzburg austria 
the april 24 concert opened the citys turn at being the 
european culture city of the year

the idea has a nice ring to 
it tokyo in two hours zooming over the earth at 25 times the

revolutionary the space shuttle and the concorde become old hat

that airplane or something like it is taking shape at this and 
other nasa centers in bits and pieces a model is assaulted in a 
wind tunnel by 4800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degrees 
below zero an electron beam illuminates air flow around a 
scaleddown plane a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough

standard airplane circles over chesapeake bay piloted not from the

the little a in nasa the aeronautics part of national 
aeronautics and space administration is not as flashy as the 
big s and gets only 7 percent of the agencys budget but its 
accomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways 
a poultry plant in marietta ga is quieter because of nasa 
aeronautics water quality in many places is improved because of 
aeronautics technology firemen wear better protective clothing 
we are called the space agency by many probably including 
yourself jeremiah f creedon the director for flight systems at 
the langley research center tells a visitor a bit of resignation 
in his voice many of us here think the a is a large one 
langleys work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics 40 
percent space with a hefty dose of military work in both with 
other nasa research centers ames and dryden in california and 
lewis in ohio its business is to develop technology and pass it 
on without cost to aircraft companies the federal government has 
played that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago 
the agency has never built an airplane but few planes fly today 
without engines designs materials and structures conceived at 
nasa we are doing research that benefits the country says 
creedon it is available to boeing lockheed and mcdonnell 
douglas whoever wants to build transport or high performance 
aircraft no single company alone could afford nasas 2 billion 
investment in wind tunnels 
here at langley they dont talk about the orient express 
its either the nasp the national aerospace plane or better yet 
the x30 next in a string of experimental planes that began with 
chuck yeagers x1 breaker of the sound barrier 
when president reagan made his rosy prediction about the orient 
express a week after the challenger space shuttle disaster 
engineers had already taken years to decide the x30 was possible 
reagans one paragraph announcement signaled the start of phase 2 
perfecting the technology which will last until the summer of 
1990 when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand and 
decide whether to build the x30 phase 3 in the mid90s would 
see the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the 
21st century begins 
thats the timetable for the largest experimental aircraft 
project ever undertaken by the united states it will cost 33 
billion clearly nasa and the air force which is sharing the cost 
have something more practical in mind than building one or two 
prototype planes merely to prove it can be done 
the military and packagedelivery firms such as federal express 
and ups are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25 
times the speed of sound fast enough to get into orbit but the 
aerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slower 
but far more useful aircraft of the future

comics impresario stan lee says the secret of 
transferring a character from comic book to television successfully 
is to avoid making the show a carbon copy 
lee transformed marvel comics into a publishing phenomenon 20 
years ago and made spiderman the fantastic four and the 
incredible hulk as popular on college campuses as lord of the 
flies a separate peace and catcher in the rye 
as editor art director and head writer he wrote at least two 
and sometimes five comic books a week for 25 years he now writes 
the spiderman newspaper comic strip 
the incredible hulk was a popular series on cbs from 1978 to 
1982 it won three emmy awards and inspired a saturday morning 
animated series that ran on nbc from 1982 to 1985 
it comes back sunday may 22 in a special movie for nbc the 
incredible hulk returns lou ferrigno and bill bixby return in 
their roles as the hulk and as david banner the hulks alter ego 
joining them are eric kramer as thor and steve levitt as dr donald 
blake 
when spiderman started in the newspapers you had 
superman and star trek and star wars said lee now 
spiderman is in 500 papers and the others are gone you have to 
realize that each medium has its own style so what i did with 
spiderman was make it more like mary worth 
the trouble when people try to bring comic book characters to 
television or the movies is that they try to do it exactly as the 
original when we brought the hulk to television we changed it 
in the comics he could talk a little on tv he doesnt talk at all 
in the comics thor is a doctor who can change into the god of 
thunder we can put a thought balloon over his head but in the 
movie hes two separate characters that way they can talk to each 
other and move the story along 
spiderman failed as a television series it was 
terrible said lee they didnt understand what spiderman was 
supposed to be i was a consultant i learned that being a 
consultant means you give your opinion but nobody listens to you 
the amazing spiderman and the incredible hulk were on 
the air in a period when television was enamored of comic booktype 
superheroes other shows included the greatest american hero 
the new adventures of wonder woman buck rogers in the 25th 
century the sixmillion dollar man and the bionic woman 
lee moved from new york to los angeles 10 years ago when marvel 
began licensing its comic characters for animated series 
i write at home he said i cant write at the office 
when i started writing all the books i asked for wednesdays off to 
stay home and write then i asked for tuesdays and thursdays it 
finally ended up with me going to the office two days a week and 
writing at home the rest of the week here i take off wednesdays 
to stay home and write the spiderman newspaper strip 
asked why the hulk is popular lee said no matter how 
powerful we are or how competent we are we always wish we were 
more so there are things in life that frustrate us when banner 
becomes angry he turns into this character of raw strength and 
power he can overcome things that upset him i think we all have 
that fantasy 
when hes the hulk hes not very bright were glad to see 
someone that powerful isnt too smart 
he laughed its funny how you get all the theories after the 
fact when i created the series i was thinking of a frankensteins 
monster a good guy whos misunderstood then i thought of dr 
jekyll and mr hyde i told artist jack kirby lets make a hero 
out of a monster 
lee who joined marvel comics when he was 16 said 
superheroes arent a tough sell people love fantasies look at 
king solomons mines or robin hood the trouble is most people 
dont know how to do fantasy they either make it too silly and 
adults wont accept it or they make it too dull 
you have to walk a fine line you have to be realistic and 
believable then people will accept something fantastic the 
incredible hulk asks you to believe that a man can turn into 
another creature everything else is very real

it was a typical postcrash day on wall street 
a slow nervous market when suddenly the demand for bigname 
stocks jumped and started an apparent rally just as abruptly 
prices tumbled and the dow jones industrial average ended the 
session with a loss 
at integrated resources asset management a firm that manages 5 
billion in investment money executives knew the telephone calls 
would be coming in from irate clients demanding to know why the 
market had seesawed for no apparent reason the executives also 
knew how they would answer computerized program trading done by a 
few big brokerages 
its just a horrendous negative for public confidence the 
public has had it with this bottom line said harvey eisen 
president of the firm this stuff is just nonsense its like a 
casino 
eisens anger reflects a deepening resentment among many wall 
street professionals over what they see as the profoundly 
destructive effects of program trading a strategy for selling and 
buying massive amounts of stocks instantaneously through the use of 
highspeed computer systems 
it has been widely blamed for injecting volatility into the 
stock market frightening millions of ordinary investors and 
contributing to a malaise that has afflicted the securities 
business since the crash nearly seven months ago 
my view is that individuals feel its a big negative for the 
market and has driven some people out of the market said john 
markese vice president and research director for the american 
association of individual investors a chicagobased group 
the new york stock exchange has attempted to limit the effects 
of program trading since the crash by restricting the use of its 
computers for the technique when the dow average swings more than 
50 points in one day 
nevertheless program trading still is considered a powerful 
influence partly because it remains profitable in an otherwise 
bleak market and because there are ways to sidestep the nyse 
limitations 
some brokers say program trading has become an even more potent 
force since the crash because its volatile sideeffects are 
magnified by an overall decline in trading volume 
clearly worried about the longterm implications nyse officials 
this past week took an additional step to constrict program 
trading by requiring member firms to submit daily logs of all 
program trades they have executed 
the big boards move received a mixed reaction some critics of 
program trading said it might take federal legislation to ban the 
technique and restore market confidence 
when you start destroying peoples basic wealth because of 
some trading scheme or gambling scheme it obviously causes bitter 
resentments said david johnson president of johnson lane 
space smith amp co a regional brokerage in savannah ga if 
something isnt done youll find a political movement for it i 
think were going to start seeing that 
the most commonly criticized form of program trading is index 
arbitrage a method for selling stocks in new york and buying 
stockindex futures contracts in chicago or vice versa to profit 
from price disparities 
critics contend the strategy is based on mathematics that have 
no relation to economic fundamentals moreover they say it 
involves little risk because of the relatively low margins or down 
payments needed to trade index futures 
defenders say program trading has been unfairly singled out as a 
disruptive force on the contrary they contend it helps stabilize 
the market by keeping the price of stocks and stockindex futures 
from varying too widely 
i think too much blame has been placed on program trading 
said daniel siegel a business professor who teaches futures and 
options at northwestern universitys jl kellogg graduate school 
of management 
i dont see anyone complaining that interest rates are to 
blame interest rates have been very volatile siegel said the 
new york stock exchange frankly is looking for a scapegoat 
robert gordon president of twentyfirst securities corp a new 
york firm that utilizes program trading said he welcomed the 
latest nyse requirement because it will show that the strategys 
influence is extremely limited this will nail it down he said 
the most significant program traders however are highly 
sensitive to the criticism and have declined to talk to the press 
about it executives at salomon brothers inc and kidder peabody amp 
co considered among the biggest users of the technique did not 
return telephone calls for comment 
whatever the prognosis for program trading some securities 
professionals say an outright ban would only hurt their business in 
the long run by driving customers to less restrictive markets 
overseas 
the strength of our capital markets and derivative securities 
attract capital to this country to the point where many countries 
are working on mimicking our capability said kelly haughton 
senior vice president of frank russell amp co a tacoma washbased 
investment consulting firm

implicit in arguments upholding a manufacturers 
right to deny discount retailers access to its products is the 
concept of service a promise built into the price of most hardware 
sold today 
the notion of service was inherent in a recent supreme court 
decision upholding a manufacturers right to pick its retailers it 
is forever promised by manufacturers retailers advertise that it 
comes with a smile 
but does it 
surveys made ever since the 1960s show service to be the most 
elusive of quests the lack of it a source of continued gripes and 
the promise of it continually ignored or unfulfilled 
in concept at least retailers who charge full price also incur 
the expense of servicing the product their relationship with the 
customer is viewed as a continuing one that might involve repairs 
or replacement 
in contrast the assumption is made that the discounter is able 
to sell at a lower price because it offers little service the 
relationship is considered closed at the time of sale for service 
the customer goes elsewhere 
but if the service isnt forthcoming how can the higher price 
of the fullprice retailer be justified if the promised service 
isnt delivered doesnt the agreement to maintain higher prices 
simply become pricefixing 
while the supreme court sought to cut through the issue 
declaring that a manufacturers denial of access to a discounter 
isnt automatically illegal unless accompanied by an effort to fix 
retail prices it probably didnt 
there need not be a specific price published or even mentioned 
for a pricefixing deal to be accomplished that end can be 
produced automatically simply by choosing as outlets the retail 
establishments that charge higher prices 
but the issue isnt a simple one either 
manufacturers spend great sums developing and promoting their 
products and winning the confidence of consumers understandably 
they dislike the idea of any retailer trashing their good name by 
irritating customers 
moreover their understanding with retailers assumes their 
fortunes are entertwined and dependent on each other the retailer 
wants advertising support from the manufacturer the latter expects 
the retailer to live up to the ads 
but it doesnt always work that way or if it does much of 
america isnt convinced of it surveys repeatedly show that poor 
service or the lack of it is one of the major consumer complaints 
of our age 
many believe the difference between the discounters price and 
that of the fullprice dealer cannot be measured in service some 
suspect the higher price merely supports the heavier advertising 
and promotional costs 
an even larger issue is presented by the increasing complexity 
of products that simply cannot be sold without service in this 
instance service means not just repairs but as with computers 
education in the use of the product 
but that presents another tricky matter why should the 
individual without need of education and without any intention of 
applying for it have to pay the full price 
there are economic consequences too one being the possible 
inflationary impact isnt competitive pricing the very essence of 
free enterprise isnt needlessly high pricing the route to 
competitive failure 
but the biggest question of all is one that has been asked over 
and over since the word consumer as opposed to customer 
became popular back in the 1960s 
in a society that produces more services than manufactured 
goods and which is forever promising to deliver service with a 
smile whatever has happened to the good oldfashioned notion of 
making every customer a satisfied one

an authoritative forecast for growing supplies and slack demand 
has many experts turning bearish on gold but others say the gold 
markets jaded reaction to recent economic indicators casts a cloud 
over any longrange predictions 
a new report gold crash risk or reality from the 
respected wefa group and metalsandmining consultant resource 
strategies inc lays out the case for sharply lower gold prices 
the researchers said steadily rising mine production and weak 
investor demand will force prices down from current levels of 
around 450 a troy ounce to 300 or 350 by the early 1990s and as 
low as 250 a troy ounce within five years 
investors and portfolio managers should not have long 
positions in gold at this time the study warns 
chicagobased gnp commodities is also forecasting a sharp drop 
in gold prices beginning next year to as low as 350 a troy ounce 
critics of the wefa report point out that gold prices have 
traditionally responded more to economic factors especially 
inflation fears than to supply factors but even some of those 
analysts foresee sharply lower gold prices 
peter cardillo commodity trading adviser for new yorkbased 
josephthal amp co predicts a rapid decline in gold prices to under 
400 a troy ounce within the next month 
cardillo said he disagreed with the wefa groups reasoning and 
based his forecast on golds high price relative to crude oil 
he said a troy ounce of gold on new yorks commodity exchange 
traditionally costs about 18 times the price of a barrel of west 
texas intermediate crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange 
he said he expected crude oil prices to average 20 a barrel 
over the next two years using cardillos simple rule of thumb 
that would put gold at 360 a troy ounce 
at the current price near 450 gold is somewhat overpriced 
cardillo said 
he said the inflated gold price stemmed from overdone fears of 
inflation 
i think we will have an uptick in inflation but certainly not 
anything to worry about he said i dont think were headed 
for a runaway inflation 
inflation is the main engine of the gold market because gold 
tends to hold its value during inflationary times 
the wefa group took the gold markets reluctance to rally on 
recent inflationary indicators as a signal that investor enthusiasm 
for gold is not as strong as it used to be 
that may be true many analysts have noted a drop in investor 
activity in all the financial markets since the stock markets 
plunge in october 
but gold prices also have refused to fall very far on 
deflationary signals making it difficult to mke any prediction 
about future price movement said david syphen vice president of 
metals and foreign exchange trading for merrill lynch capital 
markets inc 
gold has traded within a range of 440 to 460 a troy ounce 
since february 
we seem to have a high degree of stability to the market right 
now syphen said its just maintaining equilibrium for the 
time being 
reduced investor participation has left the gold market thin and 
listless and it could remain that way for some time said bette 
raptopoulos metals analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
what i see is not a sharp decline nor a sharp move to the 
upside but rather buying at any lows and some producer selling 
when you get to the higher levels she said

no sooner did the edgy bond market get a dose of 
good news this past week about the governments borrowing plans 
than it got cold water splashed in its face by a new report on us 
unemployment 
and analysts say the jobless data for april which were widely 
interpreted as showing underlying strength in the economy could 
cast a wide shadow over the treasurys quarterly refunding in the 
coming week by keeping bond prices depressed the government plans 
to sell 26 billion in new debt at three days of auctions for the 
second quarter and bond investors are looking ahead anxiously to 
the sales 
i dont like the prospects for the refunding following the 
release of these unemployment data said robert brusca chief 
economist and senior vice president of the fixedincome division at 
nikko securities co international inc 
the treasury announced wednesday its plans for auctioning the 
26 billion in debt which is down 37 percent from the refunding 
auction in the first quarter the reduction in public borrowing 
cheered the bond market since it means less downward pressure on 
bond prices 
fridays unemployment report however was bad news for bond 
prices and propelled interest rates higher 
the labor department said the nations jobless rate fell to 54 
percent in april the lowest since june 1974 a separate survey of 
business payrolls showed a gain of 175000 jobs more than 
onefourth of them on factory assembly lines in industries that 
have increased their exports in recent months 
the economic robustness portrayed by the figures rekindled fears 
that inflation could pick up possibly spurring the federal reserve 
to tighten interest rates in a bid to rein in growth 
the price of the treasurys closely watched 30year bond tumbled 
716 point friday or 438 for every 1000 in face value its 
yield which moves in the opposite direction from its price jumped 
to 913 percent from 909 percent late thursday 
the unemployment report does nothing to allay the markets 
concerns about a buildup in inflationary pressures said william 
sullivan director of moneymarket research for dean witter 
reynolds inc it all points toward higher yields 
the bond market is fearful that investors especially the 
japanese could shy away from the treasury auctions if they smell 
a trend toward higher interest rates in the air japanese investors 
are traditionally big buyers of us government securities 
a poor showing at the auctions of new government securities 
would tend to depress prices of existing bonds that is why some 
analysts are viewing the sales as acid tests of bond supply 
that could be difficult to digest 
the treasury plans to sell 875 billion in new threeyear notes 
on tuesday another 875 billion in 10year notes on wednesday and 
850 billion in 30year bonds on thursday 
the 26 billion to be raised includes 95 billion in new cash 
and 165 billion to pay off maturing debt

the echoes of the stockmarket crash have given 
way to an uneasy silence on wall street 
it seems traders and analysts say as though just about 
everybody who wanted to get out of stocks after the collapse of the 
198287 bull market has already done so 
at the same time they add hardly anyone is ready to buy except 
for a quick trade or in some gimmick transaction involving a 
dividend payment or a takeover rumor 
to the casual observer it may look as though a sense of calm 
and order has been restored to a marketplace that was badly shaken 
up not so long ago 
but it is hardly a welcome development to professionals in the 
business who find themselves with time on their hands and in a 
good many cases wondering and worrying about the future of their 
jobs 
as unhappy as they may be about the situation many market 
participants say they can readily understand it 
it is not surprising investors are reluctant to take a stand 
at this current juncture said joanne hill a vice president who 
specializes in financial futures at kidder peabody amp co 
recent economic developments with respect to the deficit 
dollar and interest rate environment have given little cause for 
enthusiasm however there is also little conviction for further 
reducing equity exposures that for many institutions are already at 
the end of their typical ranges 
this dilemma produces a stalemate in which the market is left 
to draw its order flow from takeover and dividendcapture plays and 
from shortterm traders 
assuming this condition wont persist indefinitely the natural 
question arises is it the calm before another storm or a 
breather during which confidence in stocks can gradually be 
restored 
in times like this analysts often cite a longstanding 
investment maxim never sell a dull market short but edward 
nicoski at piper jaffray amp hopwood inc says he is not so sure 
that applies right now 
were not recommending aggressive short selling a wholesale 
bailout of equities or anything of the sort nicoski said in a 
recent commentary 
but were darn right uncomfortable the aggressive desire to 
own real stocks just is not there 
it was notably absent in the past week as the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials slumped 2487 to 200746 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 245 to 
14588 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
edged up 18 to 37942 and the american stock exchange market 
value index lost 133 to 30181 
volume on the big board averaged 15113 million shares a day 
against 14147 million the week before 
the general view of the economic outlook on the street fits 
right in with the subdued mood in the markets 
the federal reserve may soon feel compelled to tighten credit to 
combat increasing inflationary pressures but if it is going to 
keep inflation in check it may be forced to slow the economy to 
the point where the outlook for corporate profits worsens 
significantly 
some optimists however say that kind of thinking is misguided 
we think we are in a period of slow growth neither a recession 
nor an inflationtriggering boom said william lefevre at advest 
inc 
we think interest rates have risen on false fears of inflation 
and will soon turn downward leading to higher bond and stock 
prices

the sevenmonth cliffhanger for control of 
irving bank corp has reached a climax with both irving and its 
hostile suitor bank of new york co hinting at victory 
but the final results of the shareholder vote completed at 
irvings annual meeting friday wont be known until later this 
month 
irving stockowners had to choose between a slate of 16 incumbent 
directors that back a restructuring and friendly merger with banca 
commerciale italiana spa italys secondlargest bank and nominees 
from rival bank of new york 
irving chairman joseph a rice wearing a v for victory pin 
on his lapel said friday that he was optimistic about the vote 
why shouldnt i say we have this wrapped he told a news 
conference 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady also said we are very 
optimistic 
although the results are not expected to be released before a 
reconvened meeting may 24 both sides said they were confident 
based on preliminary proxy counts and conversations with 
institutional investors which hold about twothirds of irvings 
185 million common shares outstanding 
irving spokesman david santos said early counts showed about 
half of the 20 million voting shares which included preferred 
stock were in favor of irvings board but he cautioned that it 
was possible a number of those shares also were sent in duplicate 
to bank of new york 
banking analysts generally have given bank of new york an edge 
in the proxy battle mostly because it already has secured the 
necessary regulatory approvals from the federal reserve and new 
york state banking boards banca commerciale which is controlled 
by the government agency instituto per la recostruzione 
industriale has just begun the lengthy regulatory review process 
bank of new york which owns a nearly 5 percent stake in irving 
is offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its stock for each of 
irvings common shares the offer is valued at about 63 a share or 
108 billion 
earlier this week the company said that it held about 59 
percent of irvings common shares including its own stake and 
shares tendered to it the bid expired on friday but brady said 
the company may decide to extend it on monday 
banca commerciale is offering 75 a share for 95 million irving 
shares or about 51 percent valued at 707 million in addition 
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price 
from may 31 until the deal closes 
the banca commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring 
plan that includes asset sales such as irvings 50story wall 
street headquarters costcutting measures and a 10ashare 
special cash dividend irving said the offer has a blended value of 
between 6520 and 7255 a share 
irving shares fell 375 cents to 60 while bank of new york 
rose 125 cents to 3025 in new york stock exchange trading friday 
some of the approximately 1200 shareholders that packed the 
annual meeting friday expressed mixed feelings about either offer 
and many said they were angered that irving had not obtained a 
better deal 
theres no question in my mind that the bank of new york is 
trying to steal your bank said robert strougo a new york 
attorney representing 1600 voting shares theres no reason why 
this bank couldnt be sold for in excess of 100 a share 
bank of new york offered irving a cashandstock deal valued at 
around 14 billion when it first made its rare hostile bid seven 
months ago but it lowered its offer twice following the oct 19 
stock market crash 
irving has staunchly resisted bank of new yorks advances among 
its many defenses was to activate its poison pill antitakeover 
defense which is intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively 
expensive 
rice said representatives from his bank and the bank of new york 
met as recently as two weeks ago but had no plans to resume talks 
in the meantime he said the company would continue to welcome 
offers from other potential suitors 
we are in discussion with anyone who will talk with us he 
told reporters were willing to consider the best proposition 
from anybody because we are dealing with a situation that was 
thrust upon us

oil prices have risen in reaction to an expected 
rise in demand and fears of a us supply squeeze caused by a major 
refinery fire 
the rise on friday was magnified by shortcovering a 
priceboosting occurrence caused by traders who repurchase borrowed 
oil they had sold earlier on the hunch that prices would fall 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate crude oil rose 35 cents per 42gallon barrel to 
close at 1774 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale 
unleaded gasoline rose 91 cent a gallon to 5152 cents and 
wholesale heating oil rose 85 cent a gallon to 4742 cents 
traders said predictions of a rising demand for petroleum 
caused partly by the impending summer driving season and a growing 
domestic economy was one reason for the rise in prices 
they also said an explosion at a shell oil co refinery in 
norco la which helped boost prices thursday continued to buoy 
the market friday although the facility produces a miniscule 
fraction of total consumption some traders said the explosion 
could disrupt the flow of supplies from the gulf coast 
as with most oneday price moves no trend emerged for the oil 
market which has been volatile largely because of failed efforts 
by the organization of petroleum exporting countries to restrict 
output and stabilize prices

the stock market lost ground for the week ending with its third 
consecutive daily loss as traders worried that the strength evident 
in the april unemployment report could lead to higher interest 
rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1277 points on 
friday to close at 200746 bringing its loss for the week to 
2487 points 
before trading opened the government said the unemployment rate 
fell to 54 percent in april later in the day it reported 
consumer installment debt grew by 446 billion in march 
the drop in the unemployment rate down from 56 percent in 
march left it at the lowest level since june 1974 
the number of americans at work rose by 606000 last month while 
those listed as unemployed fell by 191000 to 66 million the 
labor department said 
it said the average hourly wage nationwide in april rose a 
nickel to 922 for an average annual increase of 56 percent 
some private analysts said the tighter labor market is bound to 
push wages up soon and exert inflationary pressures on prices as 
well 
donald ratajczak head of the georgia state university economic 
forecasting project said 606000 new jobs is far above what 
anyone expected 
at other times we would be happy about that kind of decrease 
in unemployment but at this stage in the cycles we are nervous 
it may be too strong for the economy ratajczak said at a meeting 
in atlanta 
but other economists said the wage gains are still not big 
enough to trigger a tightening of credit by the federal reserve 
board through higher interest rates in an effort to cool off the 
economy 
the fears of an inflationary boom are overstated said 
lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group of bala cynwyd 
pa an economic consulting firm 
in the report on consumer credit the federal reserve board said 
consumer installment debt grew by 446 billion in march a strong 
annual rate of growth of 86 percent 
the fed said consumer debt grew a 103 percent annual rate for 
the first three months of the year compared with 72 percent for 
all of 1987 
seprately a business information group reportyed that 
businesses placed slightly more helpwanted advertisements in march 
than they did in february 
the conference board said its seasonally adjusted help wanted 
advertising index rose 3 points in march to 159 the index measures

allied stores corp president robert h morosky 
who was expected to become chairman of federated department stores 
inc after its merger with campeau corp has agreed to resign 
campeau said in a surprise announcement 
campeau said late friday its chairman robert campeau would 
serve as chairman of both allied and federated for the foreseeable 
future 
the statement said robert campeau would hold both positions in 
light of the size and importance to campeau corp of its 
acquisition of federated 
however the suddenness of the announcement raised the question 
of a dispute between the two men 
morosky was not at home when a reporter called for comment late 
friday 
it has been widely assumed the morosky would be named chairman 
of federated and allied at a news conference last month several 
days after robert campeau won a twomonthlong takeover battle for 
federated he introduced morosky as the president and chief 
executive of federated 
both men talked then about their plans for federated and 
morosky has visited federateds headquarters and divisions 
the statement from the torontobased campeau said robert campeau 
and morosky were discussing the possibility of moroskys remaining 
a consultant on distribution expansion and overseas office 
those areas have been moroskys strong suit before being hired 
by campeau last november he had spent 15 years at limited inc 
the apparel retailer as limiteds vice chairman morosky 46 
developed the distribution and inventory system that helped that 
companys rapid expansion 
he left limited in the summer of 1987 reportedly because of a 
dispute with company chairman leslie wexner 
during campeaus battle with rh macy amp co inc for federated 
many wall street analysts looking back at moroskys tenure at 
limited said they feared he would transform federateds diverse 
divisions into a group of lookalike stores 
the campeau corp statement said robert campeau expected to name 
a new chief executive officer for federated and allied within 30 
days 
control of federated passed to campeau earlier this week when 
the canadian developer announced it had accepted more than 87 
million shares tendered by the retailers stockholders 
the merger between federated and campeau is expected to be 
completed in about a month 
several federated divisions have been sold to finance the 
campeau acquisition and others are expected to go on the block 
campeau is retaining the bloomingdales lazarus burdines 
abraham amp straus richs and goldsmiths department store divisions 
and ralphs supermarkets 
allied stores which campeau took over in 1986 now comprises 
sterns ann taylor maas brothers and jordan marsh and bon stores 
most of allieds store divisions also have been sold
