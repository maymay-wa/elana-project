organizers of a rodeo for homosexuals on 
friday accused officials of the university of nevadareno officials 
of bowing to public pressure and using a contract dispute to cancel 
the contest 
in august the universitys lawlor events center canceled the 
contract to rent out its stadium oct 2123 for the international 
championship gay rodeo in which top riders from regional gay 
rodeos compete 
i think it is just an excuse on the part of lawlor to prevent 
these types of events from coming to the facility attorney rod 
sumpter told a washoe district court judge 
don klasic general counsel for the university and lawlor 
denied the charge telling the judge it has always been a 
contract action this is not a civil rights action 
on sept 1 the international gay rodeo and the silver state gay 
rodeo associations sued unr which oversees the events center on 
its campus 
the associations are seeking an injuction from judge william 
forman to force lawlor to rent its stadium for the gay rodeo which 
has been advertised for several months throughout the world 
forman said he would rule on the injuction monday 
klasic told the court the contract was cancelled by lawlor after 
aug 15 when the gay organization failed to come up with 9000 in 
prepayments to cover expenses for security parking cleanup and 
other operation costs 
he said lawlor became concerned about the organizations ability 
to pay expenses so a prepayment schedule was orally agreed to in 
june 
les krambeal president of the international association said 
he only agreed to the demands because he feared lawlor otherwise 
would cancel the event his organization paid 2263 in prepayments 
before running out of money 
during initial contract talks in october 1987 and when the 
document was signed in february 1988 krambeal said he was told 
expenses would not be due until oct 23 
sumpter said the written contract did not call for any 
prepayments instead it only required that 7300 be paid up front 
to rent out the stadium which was done he said 
sumpter said lawlor used the financial concern as a way to cause 
the association to violate its contract because of negative 
complaints from area residents who protested similar events held in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s 
the prepayment plan was decided only after news leaked that a 
gay rodeo was returning to reno and two local business groups told 
lawlor officials that previous gay rodeo organizations didnt pay 
all their bills he said

the reagan administration is reacting coolly 
to new soviet proposals aimed at removing us objections to a 
large radar facility in siberia 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday the 
administration continues to insist that the kremlin dismantle the 
huge installation at krasnoyarsk us officials say the facility 
violates the antiballistic missile treaty 
there is little administration interest in a soviet offer to 
allow us officials to inspect the facility or a separate proposal 
to convert it into an international space center fitzwater 
indicated 
us officials took a mostly cautious stance in response to 
several initiatives that soviet general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachev announced friday in moscow steps that gorbachev said 
would improve world security 
among gorbachevs proposals was an offer to dismantle a large 
soviet naval base at cam ranh bay in vietnam in exchange for us 
willingness to close military installations in the philippines 
president reagan told reporters he had not had time to study the 
gorbachev proposal fully saying i look forward to doing that 
because we certainly want to do anything we can to help bring about 
a better relationship between our two countries 
but in a reference to the pitfalls of cardplaying he said 
as i have frequently said to him gorbachev trust everybody 
but cut the cards 
fitzwater voiced skepticism earlier saying were somewhat 
pessimistic 
it just doesnt seem to make sense on the face of it the 
spokesman said when asked about gorbachevs baseclosing proposal 
but on the other hand he said we want to give a full 
analysis to the speech to that proposal and the context of what 
was said i dont want to elaborate well wait for a more 
detailed analysis 
gorbachev also proposed creation of an international center on 
the peaceful use of outer space at the siberian radar station 
according to the soviet news agency tass it appeared he was 
proposing the elimination or conversion of the krasnoyarsk radar 
installation which the us government claims violates the 1972 
abm treaty 
fitzwater said there was some mention of allowing us 
inspectors into krasnoyarsk during a recent superpower review of 
the abm treaty in geneva and he said we essentially reject that 
idea 
our demand has always been that krasnoyarsk be dismantled as a 
violation of the abm treaty and we still believe that to be the 
case he said 
to allow inspections or personnel to view their equipment and 
so forth or to turn it into a space station or a drivein movie 
theater or anything else simply does not respond to the need to 
dismantle what is a violation of the treaty the spokesman said 
the united states maintains that the krasnoyarsk facility 
violates provisions of the abm treaty prohibiting the deployment of 
large radar stations capable of giving early missile attack 
warnings unless such facilities are stationed on the periphery of 
us or soviet territory 
the soviets have argued that the facilitys function is to 
follow objects in outer space 
reagan got some support from capitol hill as the senate voted 
810 to support the administrations contention that the giant 
soviet radar system violates the treaty 
these violations are a threat to the security of the united 
states said sen malcolm wallop rwyo author of the 
resolution 
the nonbinding resolution said the radar station question 
should be settled before there are any new ussoviet agreements 
on limiting strategic or longrange atomic weapons the two sides 
are now negotiating toward a 50 percent reduction in such arms 
the resolution also urged reagan to develop appropriate 
proportionate response options to the soviet radar station 
fitzwater told reporters at the daily white house news briefing 
that the administration was not yet prepared to declare krasnoyarsk 
a material breach of the treaty a step that effectively would 
serve notice of american withdrawal from the abm pact 
i frankly think its unlikely that there would be any change 
in our present position against a breakout from the treaty he 
said

the muchdelayed launch of the shuttle 
discovery for the first manned space mission since the 1986 
challenger disaster has been set by nasa for sept 29 
a three hour launch window from the kennedy space center in 
florida opens at 959 am edt 
im delighted to have reached this point said richard 
truly national aeronautics and space administration flight chief 
in making the announcement friday my hat is off to all members 
of the shuttle team whose tireless efforts have brought us here to 
the brink of americas return to manned space 
the date was set after truly decided that hurricane gilbert 
would not disrupt operations at the johnson space center in 
houston home of mission control for shuttle flights 
no threat to jsc facilities is projected if gilbert continues 
on its current path the announcement said 
the first flight in 32 months will be a fourday one hour 
mission to deploy a huge nasa communications satellite discovery 
is to land at edwards air force base in the mojave desert on oct 
3 if the launch goes as scheduled 
navy capt frederick hauck will command the fiveman flight all 
of whom have been on previous missions the crewmen are air force 
col richard o covey the pilot and mission specialists george d 
nelson john m lounge and marine lt col david c hilmers 
the shuttle was cleared for flight wednesday after a twoday 
review of the shuttles systems and the readiness of launch and 
flight control teams at the launch site 
the 100 million tracking and data relay satellite that the 
astronauts will carry into orbit is a twin of one lost in the 
challenger explosion jan 28 1986 it is needed to complete a 
communications system that eventually will replace all 
groundtoair links with the space shuttle and a number of 
satellites 
they will also conduct 11 science and technology experiments and 
check out hundreds of design changes made to the shuttle 
nasa had hoped to return to manned space flight sooner with the 
26th shuttle mission designated as sts26 but five announced 
launch dates had to be scrubbed because of technical problems 
involved in the 12 billion redesign there were 56 major changes 
and more than 400 lesser ones the orbiter alone received 210 fixes 
the most extensive changes were made to solid fuel rockets that 
provide more than 70 percent of the power to propel the shuttle 
into orbit 
the challenger explosion which claimed the lives of seven 
astronauts including schoolteacher christa mcauliffe was caused by 
a leak in one booster that allowed a plume of flame to reach the 
fuel tank 
nasa grounded the shuttles following the explosion 
one major change implemented is an escape system designed for 
use if the shuttle has to ditch in the ocean it has been installed 
in discovery and will be put into the two other shuttles remaining 
in the fleet a replacement for challenger is being built and 
should be ready for flight in 1990

a joint usvietnamese team soon will begin 
an onsite investigation into the fate of missing american 
servicemen focussing on seven cases in which there is evidence the 
victims were alive when they disappeared 
state department spokesman charles redman said friday the seven 
are part of the 70 most compelling cases which us officials 
raised with vietnamese authorities last year 
other officials said that although the 70 were presumed to be 
alive when they became separated from their units all have long 
since been presumed dead because there is no evidence to prove 
otherwise 
this is the first time the united states and vietnam have agreed 
on a joint investigation involving more than one site officials 
from the two countries participated in the excavation of a crash 
site in search of missing servicemen in november 1985 
lt col joe harvey commander of the us joint casualty 
resolution center said in a telephone interview friday from 
honolulu were going to do joint investigations of incidents 
not just crash sites but places where people were last thought to 
be but we dont know exactly what happened to them 
i think its a very significant development he said we 
think this will be the first of many such joint activities the 
inspections will be concentrated in an area north of hanoi 
on friday house republican leader robert michel of illinois 
urged the families of missing servicemen to ignore the rumors that 
will be inevitable during the pending search 
we have to continue to press for an accounting of each and 
every one even though the prospects of finding anyone alive 
diminish with the passing of time michel told a crowd of several 
hundred at a national powmia recognition day ceremony on the steps 
of the capitol 
all told more than 1700 americans remain unaccounted for in 
vietnam since us military involvement in the country ended 15 
years ago there is no firm evidence that any are alive although 
officials routinely check out reports of live sightings 
the two countries reached agreement on an onsite inspection 
procedure during a meeting in hanoi that ended wednesday redman 
said the investigation will involve interviews with villagers and 
other activities 
a 90day period beginning sept 1 was set aside for carrying 
out the investigations redman said with each one limited to 10 
days 
after suspending cooperation with the united states on the mia 
issue in august vietnam recently agreed to resume discussions on 
the issue 
the suspension was precipitated by hanois unhappiness with the 
administrations policy of keeping vietnam isolated diplomatically 
and economically until that country withdraws its troops from 
cambodia 
vietnam is one of the few countries with which the united states 
does not have diplomatic relations 
while restoring cooperation on the mia question vietnam has not 
lifted a ban on discussions about a program to permit thousands of 
former political prisoners to emigrate to the united states

the reagan administration has approved in 
principle its first change in persian gulf convoy procedures as a 
result of the iraniraq ceasefire defense officials say 
assuming the changes are finalized usflag tankers in the 
waterway will be kept within a defensive zone by american 
warships and always under surveillance but wont be accompanied 
every step of the way as is now the case the sources said 
the best way to describe it is in basketball terms by saying 
youre going from a mantoman defense to a zone defense said 
one official 
the change will allow only a slight reduction in the number of 
warships deployed to the persian gulf probably one fewer ship 
but will increase the flexibility of the task force commander and 
allow the navys ships to operate at a lesser alert level the 
officials added 
the sources who agreed to discuss the matter only if not 
identified said the change in procedure had been tentatively 
approved by the pentagon and white house but would not be ordered 
until allies with warships in the region and certain mideast 
countries were consulted 
the defense department declined to discuss details of the plan 
on friday but acknowledged in a statement 
the administration is considering additional steps which 
could be described as modest modifications of our present method 
of providing protection to usflagged shipping in the gulf 
the modifications currently under consideration do not involve 
any significant reduction in force levels we are continuing to 
consult with our friends and allies 
the united states has 26 navy ships assigned to its joint task 
force middle east including 17 inside the persian gulf itself as 
of friday the navy had conducted 85 convoy operations since the 
summer of 1987 when the escorts began 
with the exception of the departure of one cruiser the uss 
vincennes the naval force has not changed in size despite last 
months end to hostilities between iran and iraq 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has said repeatedly the 
united states will not reduce its military presence in the region 
until it is absolutely convinced the ceasefire will hold and that 
american merchant ships arent threatened 
according to the sources carlucci has approved the idea of 
providing flexibility to the navy on convoys 
you keep your warships nearby always close enough to act but 
drop the continuous sidebyside presence explained one source 
the navy vessels deploy in what amounts to a picket line up 
and down the gulf ready to pick up a merchant as it moves within a 
particular range said another 
the sources said the plan called for the navy to directly escort 
merchants through the narrow strait of hormuz the sole entrance to 
the persian gulf but to use the picketline approach for the 
remainder of the trip 
this is the first important response to the ceasefire said 
one source if this works out ok then we can consider additional 
steps 
the united states mounted its escort operations in 1987 after 
president reagan approved a request by kuwait to reflag 11 of its 
tankers under the american flag kuwait a key ally of iraq in the 
8yearold war had seen its ships become a special target of 
iranian forces and wanted to obtain us military protection 
for more than 40 years before the escorts the navys normal 
persian gulf presence consisted of four to six ships

airlines have been ordered by the federal 
aviation administration to check takeoff warning alarms on all 
boeing 727 jetliners because of questions raised in the 
investigation of a delta air lines crash last month 
faa officials said friday the directive to the airlines for a 
onetime check of the estimated 1200 727 jets in domestic 
operation was purely precautionary 
there is no evidence that the alarm which warns of a false flap 
setting malfunctioned in the delta plane that crashed aug 31 at 
the dallasfort worth airport killing 14 of the 108 people aboard 
the officials said 
anthony broderick the faas associate administrator for 
regulation and certification said checking the alarms on all 
boeing 727s was not anything other than our own effort to gather 
data 
it shouldnt be read that we have any indication that the 
flaps were involved in the delta accident he said 
in seattle boeing co spokeswoman liz reese said the company 
was unaware of the faa order she added that the order is not an 
unusual action 
broderick said the action was taken because there have been a 
lot of questions asked in connection with the crash and the 
positioning of the flaps during the takeoff 
investigators have uncovered conflicting evidence as to whether 
the flaps were positioned properly prior to the delta crash the 
federal investigation has not yet determined the cause of the 
accident 
national transportation safety board investigators have said 
that among the areas being examined is whether the flight crew 
extended the flap setting as required if the flaps were not 
extended for takeoff as required an alarm should have sounded in 
the deltas cockpit but no such alarm could be heard on the 
cockpit voice recorder tape 
an aircrafts wing flaps help the plane gain lift and should 
have been extended 15 degrees when the delta jet took off 
the lever that controls the flaps in the delta jet was found in 
a retracted position and the flaps on the wing also were found 
retracted however the copilot was heard on the cockpit voice 
recorder tape to acknowledge that the flaps had been set at the 15 
degree position 
one theory being examined is that the flap setting might have 
been called out but not set properly another theory has been that 
a crew member might have extended the flaps properly prior to 
takeoff but at the last second retracted them in a desperate 
attempt to reduce drag and keep the plane aloft 
the ntsb announced thursday that an inspection of the three 
engines of the boeing 727 found no mechanical failure that could be 
blamed for the accident

former navy secretary john lehman says the 
changes during his controversial tenure didnt lead to the current 
pentagon investigation of bribery in navy contracts 
i am very proud of the achievements made in rebuilding the 
navy during my tenure i do not believe the changes that led to 
that success made the system by its nature more susceptible to 
waste fraud and abuse he said friday 
lehmans appearance before the house armed services committee 
was his first major public comment since the ongoing investigation 
became public three months ago 
the investigation concerns allegations of bribes from 
consultants many of them former pentagon employees to current 
defense department employees to obtain inside information about 
contracts those details could be crucial to winning multimillion 
dollar contracts no charges have yet been filed 
a key figure of the investigation is melvyn paisley the former 
assistant navy secretary for research and engineering and a close 
associate of lehman during their navy tenure 
paisley resigned and became a highpriced consultant shortly 
after lehman quit to take a wall street job in april 1987 
lehman was a controversial figure during his sixyear tenure 
often clashing with lawmakers and other critics of reagans naval 
buildup that buildup was the key component of reagans program of 
large increases in the pentagon budget 
lehman didnt talk about specifics of the investigation and 
committee members didnt seek those details because they didnt 
want to harm the probe but he noted the navy has more consultants 
than the other services chiefly because the service has fewer 
officers some navy tasks are performed by consultants that in the 
army and air force would be done by officers he said 
consultants are essential but we do have too many he 
added the navy could substantially reduce its reliance on 
consultants 
i was never comfortable with the dependence on consultants 
lehman said adding that his efforts to reduce that dependence were 
thwarted by unidentified bureaucrats 
lehman did endorse a pair of reforms proposed after the 
investigation became public one would require consultants to 
register and the other would direct them to disclose all their 
contracts to prevent conflicts of interest 
lehman strongly defended his running of the navy disputing 
critics who have said the changes he ordered may have fostered a 
climate which led to the investigation those changes include more 
centralized management and elimination of some layers of 
bureaucracy 
with regard to strong centralized policymaking and 
decentralized execution i see no way that either principle 
increases the opportunity for waste fraud and abuse he said 
overall said lehman the pentagon should be reorganized to give 
much more authority for daily decisions to lowerlevel personnel 
rather than top officials he opposed the creation of a single 
purchasing czar a change proposed by some lawmakers 
he proposed that the secretary of defense simply make policy 
and turn all other major decisions over to the three services 
the staff also should be reduced by half he said

electionyear mass mailings by lawmakers have 
risen dramatically and prompted leaders of a house committee to 
call for new restrictions on how much mail can be sent at taxpayer 
expense 
four members of the house administration committee including 
its democratic chairman and senior republican member said in a 
letter friday that increased numbers of taxpayerpaid mailings this 
year have caused a backlog in their processing and delivery that 
could cause some of the mail to arrive at voters homes during the 
height of the campaign season in late october they said 
critics contend that some mailings particularly newsletters 
are little more than governmentpaid campaign literature intended 
to promote the reelection of officeholders 
under house rules members cannot send a mass mailing less than 
60 days before the date of a primary or general election in which 
their name appears on the ballot mailings must be delivered to the 
house folding room by that deadline for processing 
the lawmakers said that after the cutoff period this month 
there were 58 million pieces of mail awaiting processing by the 
publications distribution service 
there were 354 million pieces of mail ready for processing at 
the same point in 1986 367 million in 1984 and 333 million in 
1982 
a temporary second shift of workers was added to the house 
folding room earlier this year at a cost of nearly 500000 and 
their employment has been extended through midoctober to help 
handle the larger volume of mail the lawmakers said 
it is essential that additional limitations be considered to 
prevent this situation from repeating itself to the detriment of 
the house and its members the lawmakers said in their letter 
generally members are limited to six mass mailings for their 
districts during a year but that does not include town meeting 
notices

a federal judge is expected to decide soon 
whether the reagan administration has considered the needs of the 
homeless before auctioning off about 47000 foreclosed homes that 
are owned by the government 
us district judge oliver gasch declined friday to decide 
several challenges by the homeless to the federal governments 
policies but said he would make his decision as soon as possible 
after taking the arguments under advisement 
william bradford an attorney for homeless advocates reminded 
gasch that two temporary restraining orders barring the department 
of housing and urban development from selling houses in the greater 
washington area and in michigan expired friday 
gasch replied i would hope they would maintain the status 
quo 
government attorneys told gasch they would have to consult with 
their clients but hud general counsel j michael dorsey said later 
through a spokesman that the housing agency would follow the terms 
of the restraining order through the end of business next wednesday 
the coalition of advocates for the homeless argued the hud has 
violated the law by selling its stock of foreclosed singlefamily 
homes to the highest bidder without determining whether they could 
be beneficial to the homeless and lowincome people 
bradford told gasch that hud receives 70000 houses each year 
about 7000 a month but the agency cannot proceed as if it is 
simply in the real estate business they must consider the 
homeless 
in a related case the national coalition for the homeless also 
argued that the reagan administration has defied a congressional 
mandate to release underused federal property as housing for the 
nations homeless 
ms maria foscarinis a coalition attorney said there are 
thousands of properties underutilized which could be used for the 
homeless she said that of the 12 facilities that have been 
officially identified as underutilized only two have been made 
available to the homeless 
its unconscionable as well as illegal that federal 
buildings stand vacant while homeless men women and children sleep 
on the streets she said 
the suits want the court to order the government agencies to 
survey their property determine which is underutilized or no 
longer needed and make those properties available for the homeless 
government attorney w robert irwin argued that the 1987 
homeless act does not apply to single family dwellings they want 
to shut down a program that has been going on for 50 years he 
said they want to tie up the program 
arthur goldberg another government lawyer said all the 
agencies have complied with the requirements of the provisions of 
the homeless act

republicans are planning to whittle away at 
democraticproposed increases in the 335 minimum wage for the 
first time in eight years through a subminimum training wage 
but not until next week 
with many senators taking friday off to campaign for reelection 
in their home states sen orrin hatch rutah was unwilling to 
risk a vote on a democratic measure aimed at killing his proposal 
for a 80 percent subminimum wage 
under the hatch proposal employers could pay the training 
wage during the first 90 days a worker is on their payroll 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the chief author of the mininum 
wage bill was ready to vote friday on his proposal to double the 
number of student exemptions that employers can now use to pay 
parttime workers 15 percent below the wage floor or 285 an 
hour presently 
hatch called kennedys proposal a mock training wage saying 
it would would not give employers any incentive to open the door 
to those who have nothing who are undereducated and unskilled 
he said his subminimum training wage advocated by the reagan 
administration vice president george bush and bushs running mate 
sen dan quayle rind could create hundreds of thousands of 
new jobs 
with presidential and congressional elections just eight weeks 
away president reagan bush and other republicans have softened 
their opposition to any increase but have not said how large it 
should be 
in june quayle offered before the senate labor committee a 
proposed raise to 4 an hour over two years but coupled it with a 
subminimum training wage the measure was never voted on 
bush campaigning in ohio said friday that a lower training 
wage the administrations euphemism for a subminimum rate that it 
has advocated since 1981 must accompany any increase for him to 
support it 
kennedy called the republican proposals a trojan horse saying 
quayles proposal for a 4 minimum wage amounts to a 10 percent cut 
in buying power after taking inflation into account from when 
reagan and bush took office 
and from that miserly floor he proposes a further cut for all 
new hires kennedy said can this be what george bush means 
when he talks about a kinder gentler america 
kennedys bill would raise the minimum wage 40 cents an hour in 
each of the next three years to 375 in 1989 450 in 1990 and 
455 in 1991 directly benefitting about 15 million workers now 
paid less than 450 an hour 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva said he hoped to get a 
vote on kennedys and hatchs different subminimum proposals next 
tuesday and a vote on final passage by the end of next week 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the house will take up 
and likely pass it as soon as the senate acts

syndicated columnist carl t rowan received a 
setback when a judge refused to dismiss weapons charges against 
him ruling that rowan was not authorized to own a handgun he used 
to wound a teenager trespassing in his backyard 
district of columbia superior court judge arthur l burnett sr 
on friday also directed that rowans case be heard before a jury in 
a trial scheduled for sept 22 
the columnist an outspoken opponent of ownership and use of 
handguns faces one count each of possession of an unregistered 
weapon and ammunition for the gun if convicted of both misdemeanor 
charges he would face a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a 
2000 fine 
rowan 63 had argued in a pretrial hearing that the charges 
should be dismissed because the weapon used in the june 14 shooting 
had been given to him by his son carl jr a former fbi agent who 
had been told it was not necessary to register the weapon because 
he was a law enforcement officer 
although rowan concentrated on whether his son was misled by 
city officials in his efforts to register the weapon burnett gave 
greater weight to the question of whether the elder rowan was 
authorized to possess the gun 
the citys farreaching 1976 handgun ordinance makes clear that 
a valid holder of a registration certificate for a firearm could 
not lend or give it to another person whether that person be a 
relative or a friend and whether the purpose was for protection or 
some other worthy objective burnett concluded 
burnett also rejected rowans claim of exemption from the gun 
control law on the grounds that he uses his home as a business not 
just a residence 
benjamin n smith 19 of suburban chevy chase md was wounded 
in the wrist when rowan caught him and three others taking a swim 
in his backyard pool 
rowan says he shot smith when the teenager lunged at him but 
smith said he was shot while trying to flee

fbi director william sessions has acknowledged 
contact between between a bureau intelligence source and the 
salvadoran national guard 
but in comments to a house subcommittee friday sessions said it 
will be impossible to determine whether the source gave the guard 
sensitive information from fbi files 
critics of the salvadoran government claim links between the 
national guard and rightwing death squad killings in the central 
american country salvadoran political leaders reject the 
allegations 
sessions told the subcommittee hearing on the fbis 
investigation of the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador that there were communications between former bureau 
intelligence source frank varelli and the guard 
i do not know specifically what he gave to the el salvador 
national guard sessions said we have no way of establishing 
that he said it was possible varelli passed along sensitive 
information 
it was disclosed last year that varelli who is suing the fbi 
for back pay had given congressional investigators a list of 13 
salvadorans facing deportation from the united states he told 
congress in february 1987 that he had gotten the list from fbi 
agent daniel flanagan of dallas and he passed it along to the 
salvadoran national guard flanagan subsequently resigned from the 
fbi 
rep don edwards dcalif suggested varelli may have had 
access to other such lists as well 
it is quite possible sessions responded in testimony before 
the house subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights which 
edwards chairs sessions noted that the bureau took action to 
ensure that the 13 salvadorans were in fact informed their 
names had turned up on the list 
the fbi early in 1987 rejected a suggestion by edwards based on 
information from varelli that the bureau was trading information 
with the national guard in el salvador oliver revell executive 
assistant director of the fbi said at the time that such a 
suggestion is not true 
based on information supplied by varelli the fbi launched a 
terrorism probe of cispes in march 1983 
sessions disciplined half a dozen bureau personnel wednesday for 
negligence in the investigation he said the bureau failed 
initially to check out varellis unreliable background and that the 
bureau broadened the probe unnecessarily in october 1983 to cover 
rankandfile cispes members who had nothing to do with 
international terrorism the fbi closed the probe in june 1985 
after failing to establish any substantial link between cispes and 
international terrorism 
sessions said the fbi in the cispes probe committed no illegal 
acts and no violations of constitutional rights

vice president george bush is steeping 
himself in the symbols and rhetoric of patriotism while stepping up 
accusations that michael dukakis is an outoftouch liberal who 
acts like a chameleon on the campaign trail 
in campaign appearances on friday the republican presidential 
candidate ridiculed dukakis campaign trip this week to plants and 
other facilities run by defense contractors in one appearance 
dukakis rode in an m1 tank 
i cant say hes not trying the opponent from masachusetts 
bush told a rally in findlay ohio honoring the us flag he 
drove a tank this week but after he drove it the tank kept veering 
left 
in a news conference earlier friday bush accused the democratic 
massachusetts governor of being a made over candidate who is 
trying to hide a liberal record from american voters 
after opposing the mx missile the midgetman and the b1 
bomber now suddenly he rides around in a tank jumps out of the 
tank takes off the helmet and comes on with different positions 
bush charged 
dukakis has since modified his opposition on the b1 
the tank did not fit he said its time to take another 
message to michael you cannot fool the soviet leadership by 
knocking americas defense for 10 years and then riding around in a 
tank for 10 minutes you cant fool the american people 
bush made the comments in columbus ohio after a tour of the 
buckeye steel plant where his grandfather samuel prescott bush 
was president in the early part of the centry 
later the visual setting was all redwhiteandblue as bush 
spoke against a colorful backdrop of flags on his visit to findlay 
in northwest ohio his appearance in the city which was formally 
designated flag city usa in 1974 was to help kick off the towns 
threeday festival honoring the flag 
he said the findlay townspeople got congress to designate their 
city flag city in 1974 because the time had come to stand up for 
the american flag and the values it represented and that is good 
oldfashioned patriotism 
a crowd of a few thousand crowded the town intersection where 
bush spoke from the steps of the stately old elks club building 
of the flag he said it is the symbol of these united states 
of america and to the liberty for which it stands one nation under 
god with freedom and justice for all 
bush has made a campaign target of dukakis gubernatorial veto 
of a massachusetts measure to require teachers to lead their 
students in the pledge of allegiance to the flag 
bush also said dukakis is trying to hide his liberalism 
he refuses to repeat the positions that he took in wrapping up 
that democratic primary bush said he ran way out on the left 
and now hes trying to move over and id say make the american 
people forget the positions that he ran on and the positions that 
hes lived on since hes been the liberal governor of the state of 
massachusetts 
later bush continued to emphasize his own prodefense themes 
when he helped unveil a monument to the airmen who died in vietnam 
at the air force museum at wrightpatterson air force base in 
dayton 
bush has planned a quiet weekend with only one public event 
attending a naturalization ceremony today for a group of immigrants

republican vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle has a new campaign battle cry endive 
quayle got a lot of mileage in farm states friday out of the 
leafy vegetable and some pithy oneliners as he accused democrat 
michael dukakis of being out of touch with the nations 
heartland 
we need people who will listen to agriculture not talk down 
to it quayle said in speeches in omaha neb and in des moines 
i reviewed the farm program of the governor of massachusetts his 
idea of farm production is growing flowers in harvard yard 
in his fiveday campaign swing through the midwest and plains 
states quayle increasingly turned to ridicule and hyperbole to 
make his points 
quayle is spending the weekend at home in mclean va he attends 
a picnic today at the virginia home of sen john warner the 
ranking republican on the senate armed services committee on which 
quayle also serves 
on friday quayle ridiculed dukakis the democratic presidential 
nominee for suggestions that livestock and grain farmers consider 
growing belgian endive 
during the primary season last winter our opponent responded 
that one of the answers to helping farmers was for them to grow 
different crops quayle said he suggested blueberries and 
belgian endive to pull farmers out of their economic doldrums 
republicans have been making hay of dukakis endive remark 
which he made in iowa since the republican national convention 
quayle said the entire national market for belgian endive is 
worth less than 10 million per year 
so if you start growing these little things dont count on 
paying off the farm debt quayle said 
he got laughs from the crowds when he held up a head of endive 
to show them just how the man from massachusetts thinks he can 
rebuild the farm economy 
in des moines quayle joined in after the audience started 
chanting endive endive 
dukakis he said doesnt understand the heartland of 
america and is out of touch with the people across america 
he said dukakis also had switched back and forth so much on 
defense issues in recent days that i decided to sum it up this 
way his farm policy is the belgian endive and his defense policy 
is the belgian waffle 
quayle said a george bush administration would open more markets 
abroad for us agricultural products support development of 
alternative fuels such as ethanol which is made from grain and 
focus more on rural economic development 
well get that capital gains tax down to 15 percent and that 
will help small businesses which means more jobs here in the 
heartland quayle said i can also assure you that with us you 
get folks who are experienced in lowering interest rates lowering 
inflation creating jobs increasing productivity and keeping the 
peace

democrat michael dukakis laid part of the blame 
for southern californias growing drug problem on george bush as he 
pledged more agents and prosecutors in a stepped up fight against 
drug kingpins 
george bush was supposed to be in charge of that war and we 
all know what happened the democratic presidential nominee told 
students at roosevelt high school in the latino section of east los 
angeles on friday 
you know if you dont show up at school you fail and if you 
dont show up at your job as chief officer of the war on drugs you 
fail the american people lose and the drug lords take over he 
said 
dukakis trying to reverse a slide in california polls was 
campaigning for a second day in the state today 
he was meeting with campaign workers in anaheim in orange 
county a conservative republican area where the campaign hopes to 
cut into bushs expected support from there dukakis was flying 
back to washington to meet with members of the congressional black 
caucus at a dinner jesse jackson was expected to attend 
the massachusetts governor planned to resume campaigning monday 
with stops in texas possibly to visit hurricanedamaged areas 
while devoting much of the rest of his week to preparations for 
meeting his republican rival in their first debate 
dukakis made drugs the focus of his california foray and he 
suggested the reagan administration had slighted california in 
favor of florida in allocating antidrug resources 
today you have less than half the number of dea drug 
enforcement admininstration agents they have in miami dukakis 
told rookies at the los angeles police academy thats going to 
change 
california the largest state with 47 electoral votes is 
considered a crucial battleground along with texas for the dukakis 
campaign while florida remains virtually out of reach and has 
been the object of little personal campaigning by the candidate 
however his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas visited 
florida on friday and today 
dukakis pledged to double the 2800 dea agents nationally over 
five years beginning with 600 next year and to add 800 new 
federal prosecutors in an effort to speed up handling of drug cases 
dukakis promised to send the first 100 drug agents to southern 
california where he said cocaine seizures have risen 3500 percent 
during the reagan years and there have been massive increases 
in drugrelated deaths 
campaign aides said the prosecutors would cost 40 million and 
the new drug agents would cost 50 million the first year dukakis 
asserted that the agents would pay for themselves however through 
seizure and forefeiture of assets 
its really a nocost step he told police officers in chula 
vista just south of san diego 
outside the chula vista police station dukakis was greeted by 
demonstrators needling him for his prison furlough policy which 
was changed in the face of public opposition 
several demonstrators wore mock prisoners stripes they 
chanted let me out ill kill again one carried a sign saying 
hey mike thanks for the weekend

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen stood in a downtown ballroom on courthouse steps and 
at a shuffleboard court in three different cities to deliver 
the same message 
im looking for old friends who wandered away in recent 
years he said im talking to the reagan democrats im urging 
them to come home and theyre responding 
bentsen the texas senator who michael dukakis picked as running 
mate to help woo the south spoke friday morning in a memphis hotel 
and in the afternoon at the pitt county nc courthouse in 
greenville 
there he spiced his stump speech with a rebuke of vice 
president george bushs attempts to denigrate dukakis performance 
as massachusetts governor 
under mike dukakis massachusetts unemployment is the lowest 
rate of any major industrial state in this union he said 
wages are growing twice as fast as the national average personal 
income growing faster than any other state and he submitted ten 
balanced budgets in a row 
when george bush speaks out against mike dukakis we should 
all remember that when it came to speaking out against arms to 
iran when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with gen 
manuel antonio noriega of panama when it came to speaking out 
against economic policies that have almost tripled the national 
debt geoge bush didnt speak he just voted present 
ill tell you when it comes to strong leadership george bush 
has got himself a bad case of laryngitis 
by evening bentsen was in palm beach fla in a trailer parks 
shuffleboard area next to a coast guard cutter where he tailored 
his speech with an attack on the reagan administration and bush for 
failure in the fight against drug imports 
they asked him to lead the fight against drugs he said 
and he blew it badly bentsen was joined by sen lawton chiles 
dfla an old friend from washington who also accompanied him to 
panama city 
the palm beach stop also included a ritzy closeddoor 
fundraiser at the home of a prominent attorney about 50000 was 
raised for bentsens senate reelection campaign 
under an unusual texas law bentsen is running both for the vice 
presidency and a fourth term in the us senate 
the vice presidential campaign which had been bogged down by 
scheduling difficulties the day before appeared to be picking up 
the pace weve had a helluva good day bentsen told reporters 
on his campaign plane 
bentsen was returning to washington this afternoon and heading 
back on monday to his home state of texas to resume campaigning 
bentsen expressed relief that hurricane gilbert appeared to be 
going ashore in a sparselypopulated area of mexico in addition to

michael dukakis pledged in california to fight the nations drug 
problem with more spending and more hiring while george bush 
questioned his rivals sincerity on defense issues as both 
candidates planned for the first presidential debate of the 
campaign 
in a speech friday at the los angeles police academy the 
democratic presidential nominee told recruits he would double the 
number of drug enforcement administration agents over the next five 
years paying for the increase with cash and other assets seized in 
drug busts dukakis also pledged to hire 800 more federal 
prosecutors 
were going to send a message to drug kingpins he said 
as far as mike dukakis is concerned theres nowhere you can run 
theres nowhere you can sail theres nowhere you can hide there 
will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere 
on this earth 
but dukakis in a later appearance mistakenly said that dea 
agents at one point had to hold a bake sale to raise stakeout 
money aides explained that the book that was the source of that 
anecdote said the bake sale was held to raise money for drug 
education 
bush the republican nominee spent much of the day in ohio 
where he derided what he called dukakis shifting positions on 
defense 
you cannot fool the soviet leadership by knocking americas 
defense for 10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10 
minutes bush said friday in columbus ohio making light of 
dukakis wellfilmed visit to a tank design facility you cant 
fool the american people 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle of indiana combined that 
criticism with a jab at dukakis farm policy by referring to his 
statement that cash grain and livestock farmers should consider 
alternative crops such as belgian endive and blueberries 
contending that dukakis is out of touch with middle america 
quayle told an audience in omaha neb i decided to sum it up 
this way his farm policy is the belgian endive and his defense 
policy is the belgian waffle 
quayle was finishing a fiveday swing of midwest and plains 
states 
quayles democratic counterpart sen lloyd bentsen took 
special aim during an appearance in greenville nc at bushs 
claim thursday that dukakis mismanaged massachusetts fiscal 
affairs 
when george bush speaks out against mike dukakis he said 
we should all remember that when it came to speaking out against 
arms to iran when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with 
gen noriega of panama when it came to speaking out against 
economic policies that have almost tripled the national debt

hey mike thanks for the weekend 
in findlay ohio where the annual flag celebration was held 
friday some residents complained bush had turned it into a 
political photo opportunity 
what was intended to be a nonpartisan promotion of fun and 
patriotism has turned into a partisan use of the flag for private 
gain by a candidate said local businessman neil scott 
the vice president returned to washington where dukakis also 
was headed to meet with members of the congressional black caucus 
at a dinner that jesse jackson was also expected to attend

the judge who will sentence michael k deaver 
for perjury is pondering sharply conflicting testimony about 
whether alcoholism impaired the former presidential aides memory 
when he gave sworn testimony 
dr william flynn deavers doctor during two hospital visits 
for alcoholism in 1985 and 1986 said the former white house aide 
likely suffered memory impairment from tranquilizers he took for 
alcohol withdrawal 
but ralph tarter an alcoholism expert testifying for the 
prosecution said motivational reasons rather than neurological 
reasons best explained deavers failures of recollection under 
oath 
attorneys for deaver offered two days of medical testimony to 
show that alcoholism should be considered a mitigating factor when 
the former presidential aide is sentenced for lying when his 
lobbying was investigated for possible ethicslaw violations 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson is scheduled to 
sentence deaver on sept 23 the former deputy white house chief of 
staff faces a possible fiveyear sentence and a 6800 fine for 
each of three perjury counts 
deaver was found guilty last year of lying when he said he 
couldnt recall contacting former reagan administration colleagues 
on behalf of major corporations who paid him sixfigure fees for 
his services 
flynn head of the alcoholism and drug abuse clinic at 
georgetown university hospital testified that deaver 
definitely suffered memory and judgment impairments during two 
hospital stays for detoxification 
but on crossexamination flynn admitted to independent counsel 
whitney north seymour jr that he never tested deaver for memory 
loss during the hospital stays and meant to say that people in 
that situation have impaired memory and judgment 
flynn also provided another piece of circumstantial evidence 
that deaver telephoned thensecretary elizabeth dole on behalf of 
trans word airlines 
deaver was talking on the phone at 5 pm june 3 1985 when he 
first entered the former presidential aides room at the hospital 
flynn said a log kept by mrs doles secretary that was produced 
at the trial showed deaver had called the cabinet official at 
precisely that hour 
among other things deaver was convicted of lying when he told a 
federal grand jury on june 20 1986 that i dont recall any 
government contact i made on behalf of twa 
the defense is trying to show that deaver honestly couldnt 
recall the telephone contact because he was drugged and suffering 
from alcoholic withdrawal 
but flynn who testified that deaver later took heavy doses of 
the tranquilizer valium to counteract alcohol withdrawal said the 
former white house aide was neither drunk nor sedated by a dose of 
librium he took 30 minutes earlier 
the defense countered with dr dolores morgan a miami physician 
who treats alcoholics 
she said medical records showed that by 1985 when deaver had 
resigned from president reagans staff his alcoholism had reached 
an advanced stage 
kidney failure that kept deaver from attending reagans second 
inaugural in january 1985 was a classic example of the medical 
complications of alcoholism she said it was misdiagnosed as an 
allergic reaction to bloodpressure medicine because deaver didnt 
tell doctors he was drinking heavily 
morgan said deaver probably understated his problem when he told 
flynn and other doctors six months later that he had only recently 
started drinking more than a fifth of scotch whisky a day 
on appeal the defense is expected to repeat arguments that 
improper trial rulings by the judge put deaver at a strategic 
disadvantage that prevented him from testifying 
the defense confronted with these rulings from the bench chose 
to rest its case without calling deaver or any of the medical 
experts who were prepared to testify

the chairman of the nuclear regulatory 
commission says the idled seabrook nh reactor will not get a 
lowpower operating license until regulators are convinced the 
plants owners are financially stable 
but seabrook officials buoyed by a commission vote friday that 
removed the only other regulatory obstacle to gaining the license 
said they will begin immediately preparing the reactor for 
lowpower testing in anticipation of a license 
the nrc voted 40 for a rules clarification that will allow 
nuclear plants to receive lowpower permits without an emergency 
siren system in place to alert neighbors within 10 miles of the 
reactors of an atomic emergency 
commission regulations say financial qualification should not be 
a consideration for a lowpower license but nrc chairman lando w 
zech jr said there are extenuating circumstances in the seabrook 
case for the first time he said seabrooks finances would be a 
factor in consideration of a lowpower license 
its a serious issue zech told reporters after the hearing 
well be watching closely to see the financial qualification 
situation at seabrook 
zechs concerns focused on public service company of new 
hampshire a partial seabrook owner which filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization last january 
in my judgment bankruptcy is a special case the chairman 
said we should be satisfied that bankruptcy will not prevent 
safe lowpower operation 
massachusetts communities within seabrooks 10mile zone fought 
successfully to have the emergency sirens removed state officials 
led by gov michael dukakis the democratic presidential nominee 
believe those coastal towns with their narrow roads and bulging 
summer populations would not be able to evacuate quickly the new 
rule takes effect in 30 days 
edward brown president of the reactors owner new hampshire 
yankee hailed the commission vote as another major step forward 
for seabrook 
dukakis blasted the ruling saying it defies logic and brings 
new meaning to the word irresponsible he derided the commission 
as the not responsible commission and said it is experiencing 
a meltdown in its thinking process 
the lone regulatory obstacle remaining for seabrooks lowpower 
license is a petition filed by plant opponents charging that the 
reactors owners are financially unfit to operate the plant 
that question was tentatively scheduled for a vote following the 
siren issue but was postponed 
the idle 56 billion reactor is losing 50 million each month 
in maintenance and finance costs 
martin malsch nrc deputy general counsel said he hoped the 
commission would have the issue resolved within a month 
seabrook officials said they were optimistic of a favorable 
ruling 
we feel we have proved to the commission that we are 
financially qualified said ronald a sher spokesman for new 
hampshire yankee 
if the nrc rules that the seabrook owners are financially fit 
the plant would be eligible for a lowpower license which allows

the pentagon has slightly relaxed the 
truthincontracting regulations it imposed after this summers 
disclosure of a massive fraud investigation but it refused to drop 
the rules altogether as industry asked 
the pentagon on friday said its defense department task force on 
procurement has determined that both the certificate of 
contractor business ethics and integrity and the profit recapture 
clause remain necessary to protect the governments interests 
the certification and profit recapture regulations were imposed 
july 15 against defense contractors named in search warrants 
obtained by the justice department fifteen companies are currently 
subject to the special requirements 
the investigation which became public in june concerns 
allegations that defense contractors hired outside consultants to 
obtain proprietary information on the bids of competing defense 
companies and that the consultants may have paid bribes to 
pentagon employees to get such information 
the certification clause requires any of the contractors who 
receive a contract worth at least 100000 to certify that they 
have not obtained any inside information the profit recapture 
regulation specifies the pentagon can reclaim profits from any 
company that has obtained sensitive information improperly 
the pentagon said it was narrowing the application of the 
certification rule by specifying the written pledge would be 
required only when a contractor is competing with other firms to 
start a new project 
under the initial version of the rule if a contractor was on 
the pentagons list the requirement was imposed regardless of 
whether the contract was solesource or competitive and regardless 
of whether it was for the start of a project or to expand work 
awarded to the company earlier 
a pentagon official who asked not to be named said the change 
was designed to lighten somewhat industry fears that firms could be 
held accountable now for actions that dated back several years

the federal communications commission is 
loosening the regulatory reins on american telephone amp telegraph 
co by allowing the longdistance leader to offer special discounts 
to business customers 
the fcc said in a written order friday that atampt will be able to 
offer special pricing plans for telecommunications services to 
respond to individual customers who have been offered lower prices 
by competing longdistance companies 
the commission action recognizes the intense level of 
competition in the business longdistance market and it allows atampt 
to respond competitively as conditions warrant atampt said 
atampt said the decision was good news for all 
telecommunications customers because it would enable the company 
to attract more largebusiness customers to its networks with 
cost savings flowing to all 
but atampts competitors including mci communications corp had 
objected to atampts pricing plan saying that if discount pricing 
were allowed atampt would be able to undercut the competition with 
predatory pricing 
atampt had proposed the discount pricing plan after holiday corp 
told the company it planned to switch its chain of holiday inn 
hotels to mci longdistance services unless atampt could offer a plan 
that was priced competitively 
atampt which serves about 70 percent of the longdistance market 
is the only longdistance carrier whose rates are subject to 
federal regulation and which must file with the fcc the prices it 
charges for its services other carriers can set their prices below 
atampts and offer customers special discounted packages of services 
to individual customers 
the agencys action allows atampt to offer a pricing plan for 
holiday corp that will provide longdistance services to holiday 
inns at rates 5 percent to 10 percent below atampts pro america ii 
service which is offered to other business cutomers 
the holiday plan will be allowed to go into effect today but 
the fcc will conduct an investigation and is requiring the company 
to keep separate accounts of the costs and revenues generated by 
the account to assure that other atampt ratepayers will not be 
subsidizing the discounts for holiday the fcc said 
as part of the investigation the fcc said it would consider 
whether the pricing plan can be justified under the 1934 
communications act which prohibits telephone companies from 
offering rates that are unreasonably or unduly discriminatory among 
its customers 
the commission said it would conclude the investigation promptly 
but set no deadline 
commissioner patricia dennis one of the three sitting fcc 
commissioners dissented from the decision saying she objected to 
allowing atampt to put its holiday pricing plan into effect until the 
investigation was completed 
she said she questioned whether the holiday pricing plan was 
legal there is a strong likelihood that the commission is 
allowing an unreasonably discriminatory and unlawful tariff to take 
effect she said

a mixup between the national park service a 
ukrainian group and organizers of a massive quilt memorializing 
people who have died of aids is causing logistical problems in the 
nations capital 
organizers of the names project a 16ton quilt bearing 10000 
names of aids victims thought everything was set for the site of 
their oct 8 ceremony in which the quilt is to be displayed and 
the names read 
but the park service instead promised use of the ellipse a 
circular lawn behind the white house to a group of ukrainians who 
plan to hold a rally and march to celebrate 1000 years of 
christianity the same day 
the ukrainians say moving would cause them too many logistical 
problems and the park service says it cant order a group to 
relocate without a compelling reason involving public safety 
the problem is that we cant force any group to move even 
though that would be the simple solution in this case but wed 
never have suggested it to the ukrainians if we knew the names 
project wanted it said sandra alley assistant regional director 
for public affairs of the park service she said she the ukrainians 
are considering moving to another location 
weve put together our program based on the site weve 
advertised it in our community and were expecting 15000 people 
and to move now would be a real problem said eugene iwanciw 
organizer of the ukrainian millenium celebration

secretary of state george p shultz said an 
arabisraeli peace depends on the palestinians dropping their 
demand for an independent state and israel ending its military 
control of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
speaking friday on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the camp 
david accords shultz rejected a proposal by yasser arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization that israel be 
forced to withdraw to the lines of partition approved by the united 
nations before the jewish state was established in 1948 
israel will never negotiate from or return to the lines of 
partition shultz said in remarks prepared for a mideast 
conference at the wye plantation near queenstown md 
but it must be prepared to withdraw as resolution 242 says 
from territories occupied in the recent conflict shultz said 
peace and security for all sides are at stake 
he quoted from the resolution approved by the un security 
council at the end of the 1967 mideast war it does not 
specifically call on israel to give up all the territory the arabs 
lost and nor did shultz 
but he also did not call for israels retention of any of the 
land which includes the eastern half of jerusalem that has become 
part of israels capital 
the speech had the earmarks of a valedictory shultz spoke of 
fundamental constants that he suggested the next administration 
consider in seeking an arabisraeli settlement 
the first point was that the status quo serves the interest of 
no party and that peace in the region depends on an agreement 
between palestinians and israelis 
on the arab side shultz gave high priority to the palestinians 
and referred almost in passing to jordan whose king hussein this 
summer abandoned any claim to represent the 14 million 
palestinians who live on the west bank and in gaza 
palestinians need to achieve rapid control over political and 
economic decisions that affect their lives shultz said 
israelis need time to adjust to a new situation one in which 
palestinians not israeli military government officials 
administer the west bank and gaza 
he rejected the position taken by some israelis that since 
palestinians form a clear majority of jordans population the 
country should become their state while israel retains the west 
bank 
jordan is a vibrant and heterogenous society with a strong 
national identity of its own shultz said it is not a 
palestinian state 
he said palestinians have a right to participate actively in 
every stage of negotiations and must approve the outcome 
at the same time shultz called on palestinians to pursue 
credible goals 
the status of the west bank and gaza cannot be determined by 
unilateral acts of either side but only through a process of 
negotiations shultz said 
a declaration of independent palestinian statehood or 
governmentinexile would be such a unilateral act he said 
in four trips to the middle east this year shultz was unable to 
set up mideast peace talks palestinians under arafats 
instructions boycotted his attempts to meet with them 
hussein demanded a commitment from israel that it would give up 
the west bank and gaza while israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
opposed the peace conference shultz proposed because it might give 
an influential role to the soviet union 
in the speech shultz backed off he said a peace conference 
may be necessary and stressed a need for direct negotiations 
among the parties 
asked if shultz would return to the middle east before leaving 
office in january a state department official who insisted on 
anonymity said i dont see that right now

jane fondas exercise videotapes were 
pulled from the shelves of the naval submarine base retail store 
because of complaints over her antivietnam war activities a base 
spokesman said 
it reflects the consumer concern and nothing more said lt 
cmdr jack ward only two or three copies of several different 
titles were removed he said 
one of the two complaints came from gaetano a russo a retired 
major general of the connecticut national guard who organized 
antifonda protests of a movie she filmed in waterbury 
russo said he walked into the store and saw a fonda tape being 
played on a video recorder 
i told them it was an insult to every american that ever 
lived russo said friday 
john w pillar a member of the groton representative town 
meeting said he also complained to navy authorities about the 
tapes 
during a 1972 visit to hanoi fonda broadcast a radio message in 
which she said some american weapons were illegal she also was 
photographed next to a north vietnamese antiaircraft gun 
fonda apologized this summer on national television to veterans 
who may have been hurt by her actions but her effort at 
reconciliation was rejected by both the american legion and the 
veterans of foreign wars 
stephen m rivers a spokesman for the actress in los angeles 
said he was surprised that the tapes were removed because of only 
two complaints particularly because the militarys job is to 
defend and protect our freedoms 
we have all the right to opinions to express them and 
should respect the rights of those who dont agree with us

final preelection polls indicated 
swedens social democratic party stands a good chance to stay in 
office but the environmentalist greens may win seats and a role as 
a legislative power broker 
swedens high taxes and welfare system and the nonsocialist 
oppositions ability to govern were chief issues in a television 
and radio debate friday that analysts said could tip the balance in 
sundays election 
ten percent of voters questioned this week said they were still 
undecided 
young greens supporters demonstrated outside the television 
studio hall because their party was excluded from the broadcast 
debate swedish public television said it was open only to 
incumbent parties 
the greens failed to clear the 4 percent minimum for legislative 
representation in the two previous elections they contested but 
this summers ecological disasters and general discontent among 
young voters have boosted their chances for seats and perhaps a 
role in a coalition government 
the five parliamentary party leaders all stressed the 
environment in opening statements but in the ensuing debate 
concentrated on calls for more housing and improved retiree health 
and childcare benefits 
a poll by the swedish institute of public research or sipo 
forecast that prime minister ingvar carlssons social democrats and 
the small communist party would win a combined 462 percent of the 
vote 
the three nonsocialist parties polled a total 446 percent in 
the survey of 1094 people taken from monday through thursday the 
balance between the two blocs was taken by the environment party 
or greens with 71 percent the margin of error was about 2 
percent said institute director bert levin 
another poll of 1500 people by the imu institute forecast a 
492 percent total for the social democrats and communists enough 
to make the governing bloc independent of the greens 
a third poll by the semka institute forecast a more even 
situation outcome with 456 percent for the socialist bloc and 
441 for the nonsocialists the greens polled 69 percent 
carlsson repeatedly questioned what he called the nonsocialist 
oppositions lack of a joint platform referring to internal 
quarrels that split their coalition governments in 197682 
voters alas have not received an answer about the 
nonsocialist socalled government alternative carlsson said 
you may wake up monday morning and have a policy you do not have 
a clue about 
conservative party leader carl bildt said the conservatives 
liberals and center parties had presented their aims 
in the only reference to foreign policy bildt called for a 
swedish entry into the european market while carlsson said sweden 
should cooperate with the eec except on foreign and defense 
policy citing swedens neutrality 
also absent were references to the carlsson affair the 
social democrats attempt with the help of publisher turned private 
detective ebbe carlsson to investigate leads in the 1986 
assassination of former prime minister olof palme 
the private investigation undertaken without the knowledge of 
swedish authorities forced minister of justice anna greta leijon 
to resign last june 
the socialist bloc won a majority of 501 percent in the 1985 
election to the 349seat riksdag or parliament social democratic 
leaders have said the party would stay in office as a minority 
government if it could 
their ability to govern would be in doubt if the communists fail 
to pass the 4 percent barrier and drop out of the legislature the 
sifo poll gave the communists 42 percent an edge that could be 
wiped out by the margin of error 
both blocs have said they would not rely on the greens to form a 
government 
the social democrats have governed sweden for 50 of the last 56 
years with the support of smaller parties 
normal voter turnout is about 90 percent of swedens 63 million 
eligible voters

iraq has rejected a un bid to send a 
team of experts to investigate allegations it used poison gas 
against kurdish rebels many of whom have fled to neighboring 
turkey 
the response was negative iraqs acting un ambassador 
ali mahmoud sumaida told reporters friday after meeting with 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar we declined to receive 
such a mission because there is no basis for evidence for such a 
mission 
at least a dozen nations including the united states and 
britain have urged perez de cuellar to send a team to look into 
charges that iraq was using chemical warfare against its kurdish 
minority 
sumaida said reports by a turkish team of experts and the 
turkish red crescent turkeys equivalent of the red cross did 
not provide sufficient evidence to warrant dispatching a team of 
investigators 
perez de cuellar did not issue an immediate response to the

here are some comments friday from the 
presidential campaign trail 
 
george bush mocking dukakis for trying to show his national 
security prowess by riding in a tank the tank did not fit you 
cannot fool the soviet leadership by knocking americas defense for 
10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10 minutes 
 
michael dukakis criticizing bushs lack of leadership in the 
war against drugs george bush was supposed to be in charge of 
that war and we all know what happened you know if you dont 
show up at school you fail and if you dont show up at your job 
as chief officer of the war on drugs you fail the american people 
lose and the drug lords take over 
 
lloyd bentsen saying that bush has failed to speak out against 
questionable reagan administration policies and when george bush 
speaks out against mike dukakis we should all remember that when 
it came to speaking out against arms to iran when it came to 
speaking out against cozy deals with gen manuel antonio noriega 
of panama when it came to speaking out against economic policies 
that have almost tripled the national debt george bush didnt 
speak he just voted present 
 
dan quayle chiding dukakis for waffling on defense issues and 
harkening back to the massachusetts governors earlier suggestion 
that farmers solve their economic woes by growing belgian endive 
i decided to sum it up this way his farm policy is the belgian 
endive and his defense policy is the belgian waffle

people from a 70foot fishing boat and found the crew of its sister 
boat beached near port isabel 
the coast guard also rescued a third missing boat and crew in 
matagorda bay were just full of happy endings today which is 
great with a storm like this said petty officer bob morehead 
at 11 pm cdt the center of the storm was near latitude 246 
north and longitude 986 west or about 115 miles southwest of 
brownsville its highest sustained winds had slackened to 105 mph 
gilbert which for a time earlier this week was the most 
powerful storm on record in the western hemisphere weakened 
somewhat but remained a dangerous storm responsible for at least 
70 deaths and billions of dollars in damage as it roared across the 
caribbean and through the gulf of mexico 
the calm eye at the heart of the hurricane made landfall about 
120 miles south of brownsville at 435 pm cdt in tamaulipas 
state said mark zimmer meteorologist at the national hurricane 
center in coral gables fla 
it was moving westnorthwest at about 12 mph and was expected 
to follow that track through midday saturday before turning 
gradually to the northwest forecasters said 
the rain was blowing sideways said ruth wooddell who chose 
to ride out the storm in her home saturday 
by 11 pm hurricane warnings for the texas coast from port 
oconnor to brownsville were downgraded to a high wind warning but 
coastal flood warnings were posted for the entire texas coast 
the danger of flash flooding in texas is very great rainfall 
as high as 10 to 15 inches maybe even 20 inches is expected 
zimmer said 
remnants of gilbert should bring very heavy rains this weekend 
to rio grande valley of texas before heading north up the 
mississippi river valley as a huge rainmaking machine zimmer 
said 
hurricaneforce winds should end by early saturday by midweek 
the storm should be in lower ohio river valley gilbert will last 
be heard of as a rain storm somewhere in the great lakes he said 
the eye passed over santa rosa and santa cruz two small mexican 
villages a few miles north of la pesca which has a population of 
about 500 said mark zimmer meteorologist at the national 
hurricane center 
the mayor of soto la marina 20 miles inland from la pesca was 
contacted by the associated press as the storm struck his town of 
8000 residents 
mayor hinojosa cortina said the towns situation marina was 
getting worse with every passing minute there are very strong 
winds its all dark there is no electricity and no water trees 
have been uprooted 
cortina said some residents had fled the town in advance of the 
hurricane but many remained other town officials said 3000 people 
from fishing villages along the coast were given shelter in soto la 
marina 
monterrey an industrial city with a population of about 3 
million is the closest major city that could be affected it is 
210 miles northwest of la pesca but protected by the small 
mountain range of the sierra de tamaulipas 
zimmer said the range should break up circulation of hurricane 
winds and accelerate drop in wind speed which naturally occurs 
when storm moves over land but he also said very heavy rains could 
cause flash floods and mudslides 
thousands of people also evacuated in neighboring areas of 
northeastern mexico including the entire beach area of matamoros 
a city of 280000 just across the border which includes posh 
vacation homes restaurants and small fishing villages officials 
said 
many streets in matamoros were flooded and officials said about 
5000 people fled their homes in lowlying coastal areas winds of 
35 mph gusting as high as 57 mph knocked out power to the city 
up to now the damages are not considered very grave said 
jose inez gonzalez a city spokesman he said officials distributed 
crackers and water to thousands of people in shelters and urged 
them to stay until the storm ended 
to the south about 300000 people were homeless in yucatan 
state and 10000 more were homeless in campeche on the west coast 
of the peninsula the government news agency notimex said 
violent weather surrounding the hurricane spun off more than a 
halfdozen tornadoes over the brownsville area friday blowing over 
at least two homes and slightly injuring one person gilberts 
influence extended far across the gulf and thunderstorms that were 
part of its circulation spawned tornadoes in alabama 
the roof was ripped from a brownsville apartment complex and 
windows were blown out police in nearby harlingen said the windows 
of 2030 cars in a parking lot were shattered by high wind or a 
tornado 
despite the danger of flying debris robert rios 16 was 
skateboarding down brownsvilles international boulevard when the 
storm neared its peak 
theres a lot of movement and its fun rios said i know 
its dangerous ive fallen down a couple of times but its just a 
thrill 
some 125 shelters holding 50000 people were open in a 
fourcounty area of southern texas around brownsville american red 
cross spokeswoman barbara lohman said 
an estimated 25000 people evacuated as a precaution in southern 
louisiana as did about 40 percent of the 65000 residents of the 
island city of galveston but most people in those two areas were 
allowed to return home friday when the storms track seemed certain 
to avoid them 
brownsville resembled a ghost town friday with many of its 
100000 residents having fled to schools auditoriums and churches 
electrical power was out in some areas and sporadic in others 
but city spokeswoman pam downing estimated at least 50 percent 
of brownsvilles residents live at or below the poverty line and 
could not afford to leave 
obviously we have those that live in substandard housing and 
they have no way of getting out of here she said and if they 
do get out of town the cost of supplies would be too much and 
their finances basically force them to stay here 
police fanned out in colonias where people live in 
metalroofed plywood shacks to make certain residents had left 
we dont want to panic anybody but we wanted to tell them that 
if they did not get out now it would be very difficult to get out 
later police sgt dean poos said as officers went through a 
floodprone area of town known as southmost about 20 miles from 
the gulf along the rio grande 
mayor ygnacio garza at midday halted police from warning people 
to leave 
tornadoes and flooding by then made travel too dangerous said 
hidalgo county sheriffs department spokesman rene torres people 
are being advised to just stay where theyre at and ride the storm 
through he said 
downing estimated only 20 percent of the residents had left town 
we didnt want to go anywhere but here anyway ramon 
cardenas 78 said while he and his invalid wife maria waited out 
the storm at a public shelter our house is pretty old we left 
everything in there if it falls we know it doesnt have to go 
very far but i dont know what well do if it is damaged 
one texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane a 
3yearold boy fell from his familys shrimp boat when they moved 
the vessel for safe mooring said calhoun county sheriffs 
spokesman rick prush 
the coast guard rescued 16 people from three fishing boats two 
near port isabel and one in matagorda bay 
gov bill clements sent national guard units to mcallen alice

thousands of residents from their homes after killing at least 21 
people on the yucatan peninsula 
heavy rains from the storm also drowned eight people in 
honduras where officials said about 6000 people were homeless and 
27000 acres of crops were destroyed 
the eye of the hurricane crossed onto land at 535 pm edt 
435 pm cdt sweeping ashore 120 miles south of brownsville 
texas the national hurricane center in coral gables fla said in 
a statement brownsville is just across the rio grande from 
matamoros a city of 280000 people 
gilbert a 450milewide hurricane with winds of 120 mph made 
landfall just north of la pesca a fishing village on the gulf of 
mexico the coastal plain in that zone is sparsely populated 
the confirmed mexico death toll rose to 21 jorge galicia of the 
national civil defense system told the associated press early 
saturday all occurred in the three yucatan peninsula states of 
campeche yucatan and quintana roo

southwest of brownsville the national hurricane center said 
it said gilbert was moving toward the westnorthwest at 12 mph 
the report said flash floods and tides of 7 to 11 feet above normal 
were expected near and to the north of where the storm came ashore 
monterrey an industrial city with a population of about three 
million is the closest major city that could be affected it is 
210 miles northwest of la pesca but sierra de tamaulipas a small 
mountain range between monterrey and the coast should blunt the 
hurricanes strentth said mark zimmer a meterologist at national 
hurricane center 
he said the range should break up circulation of hurricane and 
accelerate drop in wind speed which naturally occurs when storm 
moves over land but zimmer said he expects very heavy rains as 
warm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air this could 
cause flash floods and mudslides he said 
the hurricane struck the mexican coast first wednesday morning 
roaring into the yucatan peninsula 
about 300000 people were homeless in yucatan state and 10000 
more were homeless in campeche on the west coast of the peninsula 
the government news agency notimex said 
the mayor of cancun on the east coast of the peninsula said 
11000 tourists and residents were evacuated from beachfront areas 
before the storm hit 
power and communications were still out in much of yucatan 
thousands of people remained in shelters many areas were flooded 
and transportation was only partially restored 
the cancun and cozumel airports opened friday allowing 8000 
tourists to begin leaving the popular caribbean resorts 
the damage looks awesome and spectacular tourism secretary 
antonio enriquez savignac said during an appearance on the private 
televisa network friday after returning from a flight over the area 
matamoros only 25 feet above sea level and 12 miles from shore 
lacks natural wind breaks such as hills or high buildings 
authorities said their main worry was flooding which already 
affected some streets 
officials said about 5000 people spent thursday night in 
shelters countless others already have fled the city for towns 
farther inland while thousands waited out the hurricane behind 
boarded or taped doors and windows 
our house started flooding so we called the police and they 
brought us here said maria crecencia vazquez a 45yearold 
mother of 10 who sought shelter in a church meeting hall one of 
126 shelters set up in matamoros 
the refugees mostly poor families said they spent all night 
thursday in the shelters without food or blankets 
they closed a lot of stores because too many people were 
packing in said jose padilla 29 most of us didnt get any 
food 
the matamoros airport was closed at midmorning 
about 100 miles south of la pesca heavy winds and rains pounded 
the oil port of tampico where 30 ships were anchored power was cut 
in some areas and the airport and coastal highway were closed 
according to el sol de tampico the local paper 
nearly 1000 miles away from matamoros across the gulf of 
mexico much of the yucatan peninsula was in tatters 
glbert caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages as it 
rolled across three states of the peninsula destroying 90 per cent 
of the corn and fruit crops 
but tourism officials were optimistic they could put cancun and 
cozumel back in working order in six weeks in time for the height 
of the fall and winter season

a sixth human body part has been 
found in the ohio river and medical examiners say it appears the 
victim a young woman was shot before her body was cut into 
segments with a power saw 
the latest grisly discovery made late thursday came near east 
liverpool where four other parts have been discovered said tracy 
dulaney a spokeswoman for the hancock county wva sheriffs 
department which is handling the investigation 
hancock county coroner dr reynaldo vista identified the latest 
part as a right hip he said friday he believes a puncture on the 
left side of the torso was caused by a smallcaliber bullet 
on wednesday barge workers found a fifth part the victims 
right arm wedged between two coal barges when they stopped near 
kenova wva the limb could have been picked up by the barge as 
far upstream as pittsburgh said west virginia medical examiner 
irwin sopher 
the gruesome search began sunday when a fisherman between 
chester wva and east liverpool snagged his hook on a garbage 
bag reeled it in and found a left human arm inside 
the next day hancock county officials searching the river 
downstream from where west virginia ohio and pennsylvana borders 
meet found more bags containing a thigh part of a torso and a 
section of buttocks 
the parts appear to have been severed with a type of power saw 
and had been in the water up to 10 or 12 days sopher said 
the victim was a short white woman in her early 20s he said 
authorities are matching her with the descriptions of about five 
women reported missing recently from pennsylvania and ohio 
the main focus now is getting an id on the body sopher said 
medical authorities earlier this week said they would attempt to 
make an identification through the fbi from fingerprints of a left 
hand

sam donovan ace billboard painter 
is juggling paint brushes and cans on a narrow board that dangles 
high above a swampy bog 
you wont believe this but im scared to death of heights 
said donovan 36 who has acquired a reputation for creating 
portraits that loom many times larger than life 
donovans life work is art usually seen at a great distance in a 
fleeting glance from a car window instead of an appreciative 
museum audience he can hope to impress only the myriad of passing 
travelers such as casino tourists and truckers 
his labors may last only a few days before being covered by the 
next advertisement but the affable artist says he doesnt mind 
i enjoy looking at it for a couple of weeks if i really like 
it ill deliberately pass it every day on my way to work just to 
see it donovan said 
billboard painting requires a combination of the agility to 
climb rickety planks leading to the billboard the talent to 
translate a tiny photograph into a mural hundreds of times larger 
and the pluck to endure rain snow sleet and heavy winds 
donovan says he will paint almost anything on a billboard but 
he especially enjoys assignments involving portraits 
one day recently he spent six hours painting frank sinatras 
face right down to the famous blue eyes 
with an older person like him you have a lot more wrinkles 
and thats more timeconsuming he said wiping the paint off his 
hands and onto his splattered flannel shirt and jeans 
when i painted miss new jersey last week her face was a lot 
easier because its smooth he said but she had all that red 
hair 
the job started on a whim after majoring in biology in college 
donovan grew restless and took a job painting small signs 10 years 
ago eventually he started painting billboards for the rc 
maxwell co 
he began doing portraits slowly reading art books and 
practicing with watercolors at home 
now an independent billboard painter donovan is considered 
the best said george harvey general manager of rc maxwells 
office here 
he showed great promise early on harvey said he expanded 
his talents so well and so quickly he soon was thirsting for more 
intricate layouts 
donovan acknowledges that good billboard painters are hard to 
find 
very few people set out to say im going to be a billboard 
painter he said there arent that many of us because you 
have to be good to get a job and theres no place to learn this 
a job begins with donovan charting out the photograph on a sheet 
of graph paper which he then copies in pencil onto his giant 
canvas he next fills in the colors a tricky process that 
involves compensating for the changing light at different times of 
the day 
during the process hell climb down the narrow planks quite 
frequently to walk several hundred yards away and evaluate the 
billboard through binoculars 
unlike billboards that are simply made of paper pasted onto the 
wood a handpainted billboard can last several years if varnished 
donovan said 
donovan recalls only one instance in which he almost fell off a 
billboard the pulleys gave way and he scrambled for a line to 
catch 
sheepishly donovan also admitted that a few paint cans have 
escaped his grip 
ive dropped paint on the boardwalk on a brand new awning and 
ive even hit a few mink stoles but they probably never knew where 
it came from

leapfrogging questions over the morality of 
abortion an advisory panel has concluded that federal researchers 
should be allowed to use fetal tissue in their quest for effective 
treatment for parkinsons and other diseases 
the leaders of a national institutes of health special panel 
convened to consider the topic complimented their colleagues friday 
for focusing on questions put to them by top officials of the 
department of health and human services 
left unresolved was whether a proposed white house ban on using 
the remains of fetuses intentionally and legally aborted in such 
experimental treatments will be upheld during the waning months of 
the reagan administration 
also unanswered was whether president reagan is throwing his 
personal political weight behind the proposal which was circulated 
for private review by administration health officials 
the nih panel voted late friday 190 with two abstentions 
to recommend that research proceed 
retired federal appellate judge arlin m adams of philadelphia 
the special committees chairman indicated at a news conference 
that he and some other panel members personally were opposed to 
abortion but did not let that enter into their decision to 
recommend that the government not stand in the way of using legally 
obtained fetal remains for research 
defending the panel against allegations from antiabortionists 
that the makeup of the panel was stacked in favor of allowing the 
research adams told reporters that an examination of his opinions 
as a judge would show that he was very concerned about abortion 
himself 
i didnt know how i was going to vote until i had heard the 
testimony said adams who was one of the 19 
dr kenneth j ryan head of the department of obstetrics and 
gynecology at brigham and womens hospital in boston acknowledged 
that the fundamental question of the morality of abortion was a 
factor 
it seemed to me that the abortion question was in the 
background hovering over us all the time said ryan chairman of 
the scientific issues portion of the committee deliberations but 
i thought the panelists were so intellectually honest with 
themselves that they made every effort to divorce the abortion 
question wherever possible from the question of whether you 
could use the product of abortion 
i think that was really the key of the entire threeday 
discussion could you divorce the two some people think you cannot 
i suspect that most of the people on the panel believed 
honestly that you could with necessary safeguards make a 
cleavage between the two questions 
sensitive to those concerns the committee extensively discussed 
what type of safeguards should be recommended indeed the 
discussion ran so long the panel will meet again before completing 
its work and forwarding its formal written recommendations to a 
standing nih advisory committee by dec 1 
it did agree that a pregnant woman should not be induced to 
terminate pregnancy in order to furnish fetal tissue for 
transplantation or medical research 
it said the mothers decision to have an abortion should be kept 
separate from her decision to allow the fetus to be used for 
research and that guidelines must be drawn to avoid 
commercialization of fetal tissue 
as part of those fundamental safeguards it said anonymity 
should be maintained between the donor and recipient so there would 
not be a temptation for a woman to have what was referred to in 
discussions as a custom pregnancy and abortion in an effort to 
provide tissue that might be implanted in a relative with 
parkinsons or some other disease 
the committee members responded cautiously to reports that white 
house adviser gary bauer a staunch opponent of abortion and 
distributor of the draft executive order that would ban fetal 
tissue research has suggested that reagan might make a decision 
that runs counter to the committees recommendations perhaps even 
before they are finalized 
because its an election year i think its very difficult to 
comment on why people do what they do said ryan 
nonetheless he said it would fly in the face of the 
usefulness of appointing the committee in the first place if a 
decision was to be made before it made its recommendations

five days after hurricane gilbert 
pounded this caribbean island life for hundreds of thousands of 
residents has been reduced to finding clean water something to eat 
and a dry place to sleep 
a state of emergency was in effect today in disaster areas 
where nearly half the nations 23 million people live 
at least 26 people died on this island as the storm which 
forecasters called the most intense on record swept across the 
caribbean and mexicos yucatan peninsula this week before heading 
for the northern mexican coast 
a half million jamaicans were left homeless by gilbert after it 
hit the islands east coast and 80 percent of the countrys 
500000 homes were severely damaged or destroyed 
prime minister edward seaga told a news conference friday that 
food stamps would soon be distributed to those most in need 
the stateowned jamaica press reported that to prevent the 
spread of disease the government was trying to move people out of 
refugee shelters and back to their homes if the homes had not been 
destroyed 
on friday work crews covered roofless government buildings with 
plastic sheets replaced snapped utility poles and cleared streets 
of debris 
the jamaica broadcasting corp broadcast health bulletins urging 
people to boil their water 
children bathed with soap at an open water hydrant in downtown 
kingston and people filled plastic jugs at a burst water main 
many people stood in long lines to get into grocery stores 
guarded by helmeted soldiers and dogs 
women and children balanced large water containers on their 
heads or waited patiently in line to fill cans of cooking kerosene 
gilbert devastated what was already a weak economy with one out 
of four workers unemployed the banana and poultry industries were 
destroyed and tourism the no 1 foreign exchange earner faced an 
uncertain future 
one bright spot was a report by minister of mining and tourism 
hugh hart that the main aluminum and bauxite plants received little 
or no damage the minerals are among jamaicas major exports 
seaga who estimated total damage from the storm at 8 billion 
said reconstruction would require the largestscale international 
assistance we have ever mobilized from 300 million to 400 
million worth 
on friday emergency relief supplies had already arrived from 
the united states canada britain france west germany and other 
countries and nearly all of jamaicas caribbean neighbors pledged 
assistance 
the stateowned jamaica press said american airlines air 
jamaica and other carriers agreed to airlift supplies from new york 
free of charge 
seaga invoked emergency powers by declaring much of the island a 
disaster area thursday night he ordered the immediate reopening of 
gasoline stations and stores that sell vital supplies 
seaga also imposed a dusktodawn curfew to prevent looting 
president reagan sent a letter to seaga expressing his and 
americas deepest sympathy for the tragic loss of life from the 
storm said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater in washington 
the united states will play an active role in helping jamaica 
rebuild for a bright and prosperous future said the letter 
jamaica canceled its come back to jamaica television 
commercials thursday but travel agents in new york reported that 
many people who had booked tours to the island were still planning 
to go 
seaga was quoted by jamaica press as saying that damage to 
four or five hotels had been reported and they had closed 
temporarily others were operating with limited services he said 
in haiti military ruler lt gen henri namphy issued a brief 
statement friday night expressing sympathy with haitian victims of 
gilbert 
ten people drowned when their boat sank sunday night off the 
southern coast of haiti the government declared a state of 
emergency in three southern departments 
in the dominican republic where the storm caused flooding and 
widespread damage to crops five had been reported dead 
the cayman islands which also was in the hurricanes path 
reported very minor damage with 51 homeless out of total 
population of 23000 phones in some areas still out of order 
friday and thousands of trees were blown down but no significant 
damage was done to buildings

seabrook nuclear plant officials say 
preparations for lowpower testing will begin immediately following 
a vote by the nuclear regulatory commission to clear a major 
obstacle toward a longdelayed license 
but seabrook foes including massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
declared friday that the fight to stop the 56 billion reactor 
from operating is far from over 
the nrc the not responsible commission is experiencing a 
meltdown in its thinking process said dukakis the democratic 
presidential nominee who has played an important role in stalling 
seabrook 
the ruling dukakis said in a prepared statement defies logic 
and brings new meaning to the word irresponsible 
the nrc on friday voted 40 for a rules clarification that 
will allow nuclear plants to receive lowpower permits without an 
emergency siren system in place to alert neighbors within 10 miles 
of the reactors of an atomic emergency 
but the commission left open the question of whether seabrooks 
owners are financially qualified to conduct the tests public 
service company of new hampshire the main owner of seabrook filed 
for bankruptcy reorganization last january 
edward brown president of new hampshire yankee the utilitys 
seabrook division hailed the nrc action on the rule change as 
another major step forward for seabrook 
he said seabrook will require about five weeks of preparation 
before the plant would be ready to begin testing at up to 5 percent 
power he estimated that the license could take another four weeks 
and that tests could begin two weeks after that 
asked whether seabrook was rushing to start testing before the 
november election since dukakis is one of the plants key 
opponents he said the timing is pure coincidence 
the lone regulatory obstacle remaining for seabrooks lowpower 
license is a petition filed by plant opponents charging that the 
reactors owners are financially unfit to operate the plant 
that question was tentatively scheduled for an nrc vote 
following the siren issue but was postponed 
brown predicted that a final agreement will be in place within 
several weeks to cover payments being skipped by the owner of the 
fourth largest seabrook share massachusetts municipal wholesale 
electric co 
he described that agreement as a permanent arrangement but 
under questioning acknowledged that it would provide funding only 
sometime into 1990 asked what would happen then brown said if 
were not in commercial operation at that point well have to face 
up to it at that point 
the idle 56 billion reactor is losing 50 million each month 
in maintenance and finance costs 
to critics who complain that lowpower operation could be 
allowed without warning sirens in place brown said there is no 
hazard to public safety from lowpower testing absolutely none 
but opponents denounced the nrc vote as weakening protections to 
the public 
the decision again shows the reaganbush administration is so 
blindly committed to getting seabrook on line that public 
protection doesnt matter said us rep edward j markey 
dmass in a statement

insurance disaster teams armed with a 
truckload of computer equipment claim forms and blank checks left 
for texas as state farm insurance braced for heavy losses from 
hurricane gilbert 
the nations largest home insurer sent about 60000 blank 
checks 88 personal computers 50 rooms of office furniture 20 
copy machines 12 generators and enough paper folders and claim 
forms to handle 100000 claims to south texas in anticipation of 
extensive storm damage 
its a sizable operation and its something weve done before 
so were ready said dave hurst spokesman for state farm at 
company headquarters in bloomington 
we have 500 people around the country on standby duty ready 
to move in as soon as possible after the storm to handle claims 
an office in san antonio will serve as the staging area for 
state farms disaster team and 37 people were setting up earlier 
this week as the hurricane ripped across the caribbean the storm 
however weakened considerably after it hit the texasmexico 
coastline and headed north today 
the staff at the nerve center will mushroom to 260 by the middle 
of next week as state farm agents claim adjusters and managers 
begin settling claims 
most insurance companies including state farm and allstate 
stopped writing stormdamage coverage by wednesday morning and 
homeowners gave up the idea of buying new flood insurance after 
learning that a new policy would not take effect for five days 
hurst said space has been rented in seven coastal hotels for 
emergency offices and phone lines already have been installed in 
some locations 
weve got some office furniture and phones in place but most 
of its is being held back in san antonio until after the storm 
passes hurst said as soon as possible after the storm well 
move in start processing claims 
generators are sent because power often is knocked out for long 
periods of time due to large storms the company sent a handfull of 
cellular phones to ensure communication lines remain open and even 
25 floor fans were sent to keep computer equipment ventilated 
losses were expected to be heavy in texas where state farm is 
the largest single insurer of homes hurst said in the brownsville 
area the most heavily hit state farm insures about 8 percent of 
all homes 
we think this storm will not be as bad hurricane alicia in 
1983 which hit houston and galveston hurst said in that 
storm we paid 150 million in claims it was the worst storm we 
ever had but well still have quite a few claims this time

president corazon aquino said today 
it was up to the united states and the soviet union to decide 
whether to maintain or pull out their bases in southeast asia 
mrs aquino was responding to an offer friday by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev to abandon a strategic naval base in vietnam 
if the united states would abandon its bases in the philippines 
that is for the two superpowers to discuss and to talk 
about mrs aquino told reporters at the presidential palace 
gorbachev made the offer in a speech in which he outlined a 
sevenpoint plan for defusing tension in asia his call came 
against a backdrop of growing opposition to the us bases in the 
philippines 
earlier today sen leticia shahani belittled gorbachevs 
pullout offer saying the soviet and us military facilities were 
not comparable 
ms shahani chairwoman of the senates foreign relations 
committee said the usrun clark air base and the subic bay naval 
base were far bigger complexes than the kremlins base at cam 
ranh bay vietnam 
ramon mitra speaker of the house of representatives said it 
is us filipinos who will chart our own foreign policy but his 
deputy antonio cuenco said gorbachevs offer was a sound 
proposal 
mrs aquino said friday said she hoped the philippines and the 
united states could resolve their differences in talks over the 
us bases despite a deadlock over compensation and other issues 
she said filipino foreign secretary raul manglapus who is in 
the united states and secretary of state george shultz were trying 
to narrow differences so im hoping they will 
on thursday shultz said in washington that the united states 
wanted to keep clark subic and four other installations in the 
philippines but that manilas demands for more money were too high 
there are alternatives which we are having now to examine 
shultz said shortly after meeting with manglapus chief of the 
philippine panel in the stalled bases talks that began in april 
us officials say washington is considering moving the bases to 
guam or other sites 
the united states pays about 180 million a year for use of the 
six bases 
manglapus has said the americans have offered about 502 million 
in compensation but added the 12 billion annual phillipine demand 
is reasonable 
cam ranh bay is the soviets major naval deployment base abroad 
while clark and subic are the united statess largest foreign bases 
the united states says its bases are essential to prevent soviet 
military expansion in the far east 
about 40000 troops military dependents and defense department 
civilians are stationed at the six bases in the philippines which 
employ about 42000 filipinos annual salaries to filipino 
civilians total more than 83 million the second largest payroll 
after the philippine government

worried soviet space officials are considering 
changes in training for their cosmonauts after a capsule stranded 
in orbit last week the director of the program said 
we altogether including the mission control center the 
cosmonauts and engineers were a bit complacent about our life and 
maybe our preparedness got a bit lower our preparedness for 
functions in unexpected situations that can always emerge in any 
flight vladimir a shatalov told reporters friday 
but shatalov told reporters that nothing teaches us more than 
the difficulties we encounter in life 
cosmonauts abdul ahad mohmand of afghanistan and veteran soviet 
spaceman vladimir lyakhov were stranded in orbit for 26 tense hours 
on sept 6 because of equipment and crew problems on their soyuz 
tm5 capsule after two unsuccessful attempts to reenter the 
atmosphere the capsule landed safely in soviet central asia as 
food and oxygen ran dangerously low 
the two cosmonauts shatalov and other space scientists faced a 
moscow news conference friday to assess the problems of the flight 
i think that after this flight all the experts in space 
technology the mission control center and training center will 
make many useful conclusions that will be realized in changes in 
the design logic of management documentation and equipment of the 
center in the organizational structure and probably in the methods 
of cosmonauts training said shatalov 
before the capsule was stranded in space it docked with the mir 
orbiting space station where it left off a doctor who is to 
monitor the health of two cosmonauts conducting experiments there 
since december 
after the capsule undocked from the mir and was preparing to 
return to earth a sensor in the soyuzs guidance system failed to 
fire an engine that slows down the capsule so it can safely enter 
the atmosphere on a second attempt the braking engine fired under 
automatic control but shut itself down 
lyakhov admitted to reporters last week that he had made 
mistakes such as improperly restarting the engine after the second 
failed attempt but he did not refer to the mistake at fridays 
briefing 
alexander dunayev chief of the space agency glavkosmos said 
mission control also erred when it did not make a necessary 
adjustment to control the speed of the descent the problem was 
diagnosed and resolved he said but you can see we made a 
certain mistake in control and those mistakes should be 
liquidated 
shatalov said friday that the stranded capsule could have made 
an emergency landing at various sites in the soviet union and in 
the united states canada and france but he said the return to 
earth was postponed to give mission control and the cosmonauts time 
to set up the landing at the planned soviet site where ground 
crews were waiting to assist the cosmonauts after touchdown 
dunayev said the soviets hope to launch an unmanned space 
shuttle this year but want to be completely certain of a successful 
mission before a launch is scheduled

this partially evacuated city 
spared the worst of hurricane gilbert became a windsurfers 
paradise as crowds turned out to ride the blustery skirts of the 
giant storm 
boardedup buildings and empty streets made much of corpus 
christi seem abandoned but ocean drive was jammed with traffic jam 
friday as residents and tourists flocked to the seawall after word 
that gilbert would hit farther to the south than expected 
scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road as 
bicyclists joggers and windsurfers were joined by crowds of 
residents complaining of cabin fever in their boardedup homes 
this is definitely the advanced class said nancy clark a 
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35mph winds here 
after fleeing port isabel 
her biggest danger was the parking lot beside the beach 
i was so excited when i got here and saw the waves that i 
slipped down on the pavement she said rolling up her wetsuit to 
display a small gash on her shin this is what we wait all year 
for 
this definitely rates a 10 but its also a good day for 
conservative positive sailing said corpus christi architect 
robert jones one of about a halfdozen windsurfers who rode high 
tides at 4 feet above normal levels 
i was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up 
getting kind of bored said jones i decided id just get out 
here and see what the winds were like 
many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay had heard 
repeated warnings that gilbert would likely turn toward the north 
striking land near brownsville and bashing corpus christi with 
heavy wind and rain 
but when the hurricane stayed on its course toward mexico the 
seawall swelled with confident crowds despite warnings of flash 
floods 
most people probably wouldnt expect to see this many people 
down here in a hurricane but once youve lived in corpus christi 
for a while you come to expect the unusual out of the residents 
said russ roland who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the 
seawall 
for a lot of the natives here its seen as kind of a sign of 
bravado roland said 
we dont have this many people out here on an average day 
during the summer he said 
families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the 
concrete steps and children danced along the edge of the churning 
water mugging for cameras 
many including doug reiter said they just grew tired of 
sitting inside a house darkened by plywoodcovered windows 
i think everybody is just bored and this is kind of a release 
from being cooped up he said you can only take that sort of 
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy

the late al donahue a native texan who later 
lived in arizona was 18 in september 1900 when a hurricane struck 
galveston island just before midnight killing 6000 people it was 
the worst natural disaster in us history heres his account of 
that storm as written from his journal of some years later 
it was on a saturday and the wind was blowing from the south 
coming in from the gulf and gradually increasing its velocity as 
the day wore on 
i and one or two of my brothers were cutting redtop cane by 
hand and standing it in large round shocks 
the clouds come up about the middle of the morning and got 
thicker as the hours passed and about 330 in the afternoon i 
could head a deep low sound of thunder in the southeast and as it 
slowly come close and closer the very ground that i stood on would 
vibrate for long periods and the wind was increasing and the 
clouds looked nearly as black as bellows of coal smoke and were 
down close to the tree tops 
all birds stopped their singing and no cricket or frog made any 
sound just the wind and the continued sound of heavy thunder is 
all that you could hear 
there is a helpless feeling that accompanies any real storm 
cloud for all of natures life of low or high cast one has 
no idea just how unimportant and small and helpless a storm can 
make anyone feel and this storm on that september day is the 
darkest of my memory 
the waves come over the 50foot seawalls and all was 
confusion you could hear screams for help and the prayers and 
cries of the drowning above the sound of the thunders and rolling 
billows of the deep as they come in and over the entire town 
in one of the higher buildings the third floor held the 
central telephone switchboard and the girls on duty stayed until 
the water come through the windows and then all soon was washed out 
into the tempest of surging water 
timbers trees logs houses people horses cattle hogs dogs 
and chickens turkeys and other animals and fowls was all mixed in 
those waves as they come in and swept back out to sea carrying in 
their undercurrent everything that was caught as they boiled up 
over and down and under then back to repeat the same action over 
and over for 12 to 14 hours 
there was a society ball held on the third floor of a brick 
building they danced and sang and prayed cried and screamed but 
the music continued until the waves come through the windows and 
all were taken 
when daylight finally came a deathshrouded dawn he was 
in the water 
there was a young woman bobbed up right near holding to a heavy 
timber with one hand and under the other arm she held a baby or a 
small child and soon as she could she cried for help i was near 
on a timber or timbers that seemed to be the wood ceiling of a 
large room i could almost reach out and catch them but as i 
was about to get a good hold the bottom fell out of where we was 
and everything went down and down but i still stayed with my 
timbers and when i come to the surface again and got the salt water 
out of my face and eyes i looked in every direction and by the 
flashes of lightning i saw my young lady again but she was not 
close and she did not have that child very soon there was a 
mountain of water between she was and me and i never seen her 
any more to know it

for six couples the memories of a 
jamaican vacation will include flying debris quivering buildings 
water sloshing in toilet bowls and ocean foam splashing at their 
hotel windows 
the couples from fernandina beach whose fourday holiday began 
as a lark were among thousands of travelers trapped on the island 
by hurricane gilbert one of the centurys most violent storms 
you couldnt see the ground from our room three stories 
above jan nabors one of the group recalled thursday you 
couldnt see three or four feet in front of you on the balcony 
in jamaica where winds reached 175 mph an estimated 500000 
people were left homeless and at least 26 were reported dead from 
gilbert which passed directly over the island monday 
the fernandina beach couples attempted to leave jamaica on 
sunday from montego bay but high winds had already canceled the 
flights 
the tourists were told they would be evacuated from sandals 
royal caribbean hotel to a more secure structure the next day the 
group was taken by bus to join about 1500 tourists taking refuge 
at the wyndham hotel a sevenstory structure about 300 feet from 
the ocean 
the air was white with foam blown from the sea tourist john 
burbank said 
on the ocean side windows were being blown out said mrs 
nabors husband donald 
some of the group began to move out into the hotel hallways to 
hide from flying glass if their windows burst they said 
at one point the windows in another room burst the door was 
blown off the hinges and the hallway walls began to lean inward 
from the force of the wind nabors said 
we saw the wall buckling in and when it started doing that we 
moved on down to the end of the hallway we were getting away from 
the ocean side of the hotel and going to the inland side 
once it blew out the windows you could feel the whole 
corridor vibrating he said 
under the assault of the winds the entire hotel shook mrs 
nabors said 
the water was sloshing out of the toilets she said 
thats shaking 
the couples arrived at jacksonville international airport on 
thursday 
were just glad to be alive nabors said as he walked off 
the plane it was a hell of a storm

federal officials have overcome major legal 
obstacles in their case against ferdinand marcos and it is now 
likely they will ask a federal grand jury to indict the former 
philippine president for fraud the los angeles times reported 
today 
however the indictment is expected to deal only with 
accusations of wrongdoing after marcos left office in february 
1986 the newspaper said 
the case was narrowed to overcome doubts about whether us law 
could apply to the deposed presidents alleged efforts to 
misappropriate billions of dollars in philippine taxpayers funds 
according to anonymous sources cited by the newspaper 
the indictment anticipated for months has been delayed by a 
number of circumstances 
acting associate attorney general francis a keating ii 
expressed reservations at one point about the quality of the case 
when draft charges were brought before him 
the investigation is now focusing on allegations that marcos and 
his wife imelda conspired with saudi arabian financier adnan 
khashoggi and others to violate us district court injunctions 
they allegedly secretly transferred ownership of hundreds of 
millions of dollars in stolen art and manhattan real estate bought 
with philippine government funds 
court records in related civil lawsuits allege that marcos took 
control of the funds while he was still in power but used elaborate 
schemes involving front companies and agents to hide his ownership 
and liquidate properties after he went into exile in hawaii 
the interagency police review group which became more 
prominent in the wake of the diplomatically embarrassing attempt to 
prosecute panamanian strongman manuel a noriega on federal drug 
charges in florida helped settle problems with the legal case 
early in the week the times said 
us attorney rudolph w giuliani in new york along with his 
staff outlined details of proposed criminal charges against marcos 
at a white house meeting of the review group tuesday the times 
said president reagan did not attend 
intelligence advisers are expected next week to offer their 
opinions on how the case could affect foreign relations 
in a statement issued from the philippine embassy in washington 
dc severina rivera general counsel for his governments 
presidential commission on good government said 
there has been considerable skepticism in manila about 
president reagans willingness to approve the indictment of mr 
marcos if he approves it filipinos everywhere will applaud 
mr reagan and the american system of justice that applies the full 
force of the law to corrupt dictators who violate us laws 
however some concern has been expressed that marcos may flee to 
mexico or another country because the indictment is imminent a 
source told the times

mayor carl peve and two members of the 
village board have quit in a pigheaded dispute over pork 
sandwiches and control of a town festival 
a third village board member is threatening to resign after a 
board meeting this week failed to resolve questions about who 
should monitor the annual lafayette reunion days 
im done im through being called names and having people 
wave their fists in my face said mayor peve 
the dispute concerns an ordinance empowering the village board 
to oversee the activities of a committee that organizes summer 
festivals 
gene scott president of this years organizing group the 
reunion committee said the threeday festival in august was a 
success and drew more than 1500 visitors to the town of 277 
but peve insists the committee needs to be monitored and some 
of the loudest squealing concerned the mayors allegation that the 
committee slaughtered several hogs and sold pork sandwiches without 
having the meat properly inspected 
dennis lovins of the illinois department of agriculture said 
meat products must be inspected before being sold scott who noted 
communities commonly slaughter hogs for fairs said his only 
mistake was in not asking people to make a donation for the 
sandwiches instead of buying them 
this town is supposed to be a community of little helpers but 
some members of the board got pigheaded and decided to play god and 
butt into our business scott said

firefighters looked 
forward to another wet and cool weekend in yellowstone national 
park but elsewhere across the west forest fires continued to rage 
under the whip of shifting winds 
the fires that have affected half of the parks 22 million 
acres stayed within containment lines although flames shot through 
the park on friday with temperatures increasing to the mid60s and 
steady winds approaching 35 mph authorities said 
todays forecast called for a chance of light snowshowers this 
afternoon and temperatures in the 50s heavy winds also were 
expected but park spokeswoman sonya capek said the high humidity 
and cool temperatures would keep the fires down 
firefighters in glacier national park in montana were not as 
lucky friday about 200 firefighters were forced to retreat from a 
blaze after winds gusting to 40 mph pushed a wall of fire past 
containment lines 
it was just an incredible show fire information officer kim 
berns said of the 300feet high flames 
shifting winds pushed the 34500acre fire up a drainage along 
the northeast flank where crews were reconstructing lines that blew 
out thursday berns said 
in idaho officials were throwing all available manpower and 
equipment at a wilderness fire in the northcentral gospel hump 
wilderness as wildfires continued to burn in most of the states 
national forests 
i dont know if were over the hump as far as the fire season 
goes but weve been saying were guardedly optimistic said 
sandi sacher an information officer at the boise interagency fire 
center 
fires that have consumed more than 190000 acres remained out of 
control and outside wilderness boundaries in the nez perce 
challis panhandle and salmon national forests she said 
firefighters in washington state meanwhile contained three 
large fires that have charred more than 70000 acres 
in yellowstone 30 canadian firefighters arrived friday to help 
battle the flames burning within nearly 12 million acres of the 
22 millionacre park the helitak group was the first canadian 
crew to arrive on scene since the us forest service accepted that 
countrys offer to help 
the experienced firefighters are a firstattack group which 
fights flames from a helicopter capek said 
this past week firefighters took advantage of the wet cold 
weather to strengthen existing lines around fires and extend the 
lines by friday 50 percent of the 335500acre north fork fire 
the most troublesome of the blazes in the park had been contained 
officials believe the rain and snow that fell in the park had 
dampened fuels sufficiently so that only seven days of continued 
dry weather would bring back the tinderdry conditions that allowed 
fires to grow by thousands of acres daily said denny bungarz 
north fork fire incident commander officials predicted they would 
contain that blaze by midoctober 
military personnel were stationed on either side of us highway 
191 the fires western edge to keep it from jumping the road 
if you put two hot shot crews in competition with each other 
its a situation of two plus two equals five bungarz said i 
think the army and the marines will react the same way 
about 700 marines from camp pendleton in california arrived 
friday bringing the military force in the park up to 4100 
fire information officer marvin crocker said the marines 
probably would be out on the fire lines today 
in oakridge ore a 5000 reward was offered for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for 
starting a forest fire burning in the willamette national forest 
a fire patrol plane crew and witnesses have given fire 
investigators solid leads about vehicles seen in the area when the 
blaze was only about an acre in size forest officials said 
the fire had grown to 7300 acres friday but forest service 
officials predicted it would be contained by next week and 
controlled by the end of the month

iraq trying to counter charges it used 
poison gas against its kurdish minority brought foreign 
correspondents to the heart of kurdistan and paraded kurds who 
denounced the rebels and praised iraq 
the local kurds denied the government used poison gas against 
them and scorned the rebels who fled to turkey last month 
if one of them comes i would drink his blood like water they 
are the traitors of our country naima khader hussein told 
reporters friday in sulaymaniyah 
she said her husband died fighting the rebels in 1985 around 
her were dozens of other relatives of kurds killed by insurgents 
many holding pictures of their loved ones 
the iraqi government infuriated by mounting western charges 
that it used poison gas to crush kurdish insurgents arranged the 
oneday trip for journalists to show the accusations were baseless 
journalists from the around the world were flown by jetliner 
friday from baghdad to the oil center of kirkuk there they boarded 
soviet mi8 helicopters and flew to sulaymaniyah then on to mosul 
by dusk there was also a side trip by bus to meet kurdish refugees 
who had accepted an amnesty program in arbat near sulaymaniyah 
government officials in green uniforms hovered over each 
interview and helped translate some kurdish to arabic and then to 
english they often cut off talks after a few minutes to rush 
reporters on to the next engagement 
at a new cinder block village a group of kurds greeted the 
journalists chanting with blood and soul we sacrifice ourselves 
for you saddam referring to president saddam hussein 
officials said the group came from dirty villages but 
several of them said they had moved from the city of sulaymaniyeh 
to take advantage of free houses 
the towns themselves were busy full of kurdish men in sashed 
baggy trousers and distinctive head scarves 
but the view during the helicopter flight from sulaymaniyah 
appeared to confirm reports that the government is relocating many 
kurds from remote villages into new concrete housing complexes and 
destroying old settlements 
reporters saw several new housing complexes laid out in 
geometric order near highways on the kurdish plain 
there were few if any villages of the traditional style visible 
from the air and dozens appeared demolished a few were scorched 
with fire 
on thursday defense minister adnan khairallah said villagers 
were being relocated away from the border for security reasons and 
also to provide them with improved services 
none of the kurds brought forward by the government accused 
iraqi officials of knocking down villages 
the rebels used to burn the villages and take the families 
away said majid karim sharif in arbat 
camp officials said more than 4200 kurds had returned to the 
arbat center about 56 miles from the border with iran to take 
advantage of the amnesty announced by the iraqi government last 
week 
the government has said previously that more than 11500 kurds 
have sought amnesty 
in a separate development a spokesman for the kurdish rebels 
claimed that 2400 kurdish civilians trapped in a mountain ravine 
were killed in a poison gas attack aug 30 by iraqi warplanes 
word of the alleged slaughter was delayed because it took the 
handful of kurds who survived the attack 10 days to reach southern 
turkey and contact rebel officials the spokesman for the kurdistan 
democratic party reported in a telephone interview with the 
associated press in cyprus 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
victims were fleeing an iraqi military offensive by trekking to 
turkey 
he claimed the casualties raised the number of kurds killed by 
iraqi chemical weapons since early august to around 4300 
the official also said that kurdistan democratic party 
guerrillas battling an estimated 60000 iraqi troops pushing into 
rebelheld mountains in northern iraq killed 140 in a major clash 
several days ago

actress valerie harper was awarded 185 
million and a share of the profits from the show valerie by a 
jury that found the lorimar production company acted in bad faith 
in firing her 
the jury foreman said the message of fridays verdict was you 
just have to treat people fairly 
miss harper said she felt vindicated gratified thrilled 
with the verdict which her lawyer said could earn the actress up 
to 15 million 
the truth did prevail she told reporters we won 
financially we won morally i dont see any loss of any kind 
the superior court jury spent nearly a month hearing evidence 
and took 4 days to reach a complex verdict that required them to 
answer more than 30 questions 
lorimar telepictures corp which produces the nbc series 
originally sued miss harper claiming she breached her contract by 
quitting the show a countersuit by the actress and her husband 
contended she was wrongfully fired in august 1987 nbc and 
individual producers were dropped from that suit during trial 
the jury found that miss harper her husband tony cacciotti 
and their company av productions had lived up to their contracts 
with lorimar 
but they said lorimar acted in bad faith without a reasonable 
basis or probable cause by firing the actress 
jurors believed that lorimar witnesses lied when they said miss 
harper was out to submarine the show said the jury foreman 
postal worker archie mcdaniels 
the firm should not have held a crucial meeting in miss harpers 
absence before firing her he said 
the television business is just like any other business 
mcdaniels said you have good and bad this verdict doesnt 
condemn the tv industry you just have to treat people fairly 
the panel awarded the 185 million in general damages for lost 
wages but declined to award punitive damages to miss harper and 
her husband who was a supervising producer on the nbc series 
miss harper also was granted a 12 percent share of adjusted 
gross profits for the 198788 season including fees for 
syndication of the show her contract would have run through 1991 
her attorney barry langberg said the share of the gross 
profits could bring the actress 10 million to 15 million in the 
long run 
lorimars attorney donald engel expressed relief that punitive 
damages were not awarded 
it could have been worse he said adding that an appeal was 
unlikely because the verdict is so small 
but lorimar spokeswoman barbara brogliatti disagreed were 
disappointed in the verdict she said and our attorney has 
advised us there are grounds for an appeal and we are considering 
it 
some of the jurors lined up in the hallway after delivering 
their verdict to get miss harpers autograph 
at the trial the company claimed that miss harper was 
emotionally unstable and menopausal a position she denounced 
friday as sexist 
sandy duncan replaced miss harper on the show which was 
retitled the hogan family

several hundred thousand antigovernment 
protesters took to the streets of the capital today to demand 
democracy and troops opened fire on a crowd surrounding government 
buildings wounding at least three 
most of the protesters today marched peacefully in lines through 
the streets of the capital some carrying placards that read if 
we dont get it we will hit out 
but a violent scene developed around the trade ministry 
building where troops opened fire to disperse an angry crowd at 
least three people were wounded 
the sound of gunfire attracted a much larger crowd and many 
threatened to burn down the building buddhist monks intervened 
before the threats could be carried out 
soon after a group of students clambered over adjacent rooftops 
to break into the ministry building it was not immediately clear 
whether the students remained in the building or had been persuaded 
to leave 
protesters also surrounded two other nearby government 
buildings city hall and the central bank shooting was heard in 
the area but it could not immediately be determined who was 
involved 
troops had not been reported to fire on antigovernment 
protesters since midaugust 
about 100 soldiers were posted at both the central bank and city 
hall but only a few were at the trade ministry 
todays protests indicated that the population of rangoon the 
nations capital was unsatisfied with yet another concession by 
the government 
state radio announced friday that all military personnel and 
civil servants must resign from the ruling burma socialist program 
party and refrain from membership in all future political parties 
the decision the radio said was made at the recommendation of 
a recently formed election commission which is to supervise 
multiparty elections in about three months the opposition has 
rejected this move saying an interim government must be formed 
before elections take place 
about twothirds of the 25 million members of the ruling party 
come from military and civil service ranks 
some opposition leaders who are believed to be negotiating with 
president maung maungs government have been attempting to stop 
mob violence from escalating 
on friday prominent dissident aung gyi defused a potentially 
bloody confrontation between soldiers and more than 100000 
demonstrators moving on the ministry of defense armed with spears 
swords and knives 
aung gyi a former brigadier general asked the crowd to fight 
without bloodshed 
we cannot blame these soldiers for the faults of some of their 
commanders he told the crowd soldiers are born of the people 
they are the peoples army 
one burmese intellectual who watched the confrontation said of 
the protesters they dont seem to be afraid of the guns they 
are angry and frustrated 
interviews with a number of burmese government employees today 
also indicated that a government warning that all civil servants 
return to work by sept 26 or face official action would go 
unheeded 
virtually all government employees including some police and 
military personnel have been on strike since aug 8 causing an 
almost total administrative breakdown 
massive protests began after strongman ne win who seized power 
in 1962 resigned last july his replacement hardliner sein lwin 
attempted to restore order by ordering the military to fire at the 
swelling number of protestors but resigned 17 days later 
on aug 19 the relatively moderate maung maung became burmas 
first civilian leader in a quarter century but he has also been 
unable to stop the nationwide uprising

citys streets today in an antiolympic protest on the games 
opening day and police arrested about a dozen of them witnesses 
said 
the students marched from a shopping center toward myongdong

the witnesses said 
no tear gas was fired and no injuries reported they said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
it was the first known antiolympic street demonstration in 
seoul in recent weeks most student protests have been carried out 
on university campuses 
radical students who form a small minority in south korea are 
demanding that the olympics be shared with north korea to help 
unify the korean peninsula which was divided at the end of world 
war ii in 1945 
north korea boycotted the olympics after its demand to cohost

the biggest athletic show on earth 
opened today with a record number of nearly 10000 olympic athletes 
from 160 countries marching under a massive security blanket and 
the jealous glare of communist north korea 
a colorful 3hour spectacle mixing ancient korean rituals with 
spaceage technology kicked off 16 days of athletic competition at 
the seoul summer games the games will provide a showcase for south 
korea and produce the first allout eastwest gold rush since the 
1976 montreal games 
im glad the sky is so high and so blue yuk heejin a 
17yearold korean high school student said on entering the 
stadium i believe god is blessing my country for its years of 
hard work and preparations for the olympic games 
after mutual boycotts of the 1980 moscow and 1984 los angeles 
games soviet bloc and western athletes strode into seouls 
sunwashed olympic stadium in closed ranks to the tumultuous roar 
of a sellout crowd of 70000 
on the streets of downtown seoul meanwhile police arrested 
about a dozen radical students today for mounting an antiolympic 
protest witnesses said but no tear gas was fired to quell the 
protest and no injuries were reported 
at least a billion others watched the olympics via a 115nation 
worldwide television hookup nbc alone paid 300 million for 
television rights to the games which cost the south korean hosts 
31 billion for stadiums arenas and various support facilities 
all of which were in place well before the start of the games 
by decree of the international olympic committee north korean 
television was blacked out the communist nation had demanded to 
cohost the games but olympic officials said only one nation can 
do so 
superlatives of the seoul games included the most athletes 
9633 the most countries 20 more than at los angeles the most 
gold medals 237 and the most venues 34 for 23 official sports 
and three demonstration sports 
communist north korea sparked a miniboycott that failed to sway 
its biggest political allies including the soviet union and china 
of the countries following north koreas boycott only cuba 
ranked as a sports power while ethiopia had hopes in the marathon 
both also boycotted the los angeles games 
the other noshows albania the seychelles madagascar and 
nicaragua are not regarded as major sports nations 
on the eve of the opening ceremonies north korea again 
displayed its wrath saying in an official communist party 
statement that south korean president roh taewoos call for a 
successful opening of the olympics will help intensify the 
fascist rule increase the danger of war and mean tolerating the 
schemes to perpetuate the division of the nation 
similar criticism of the games has come from student radicals in 
the south hundreds of whom staged scattered antiolympic 
antigovernment and antius demonstrations in seoul as the 
olympic torch arrived in the capital friday but none of the 
demonstrations came near the heavily guarded olympic facilities or 
the torch procession they also failed to arouse popular support 
in one protest at the kookmin university about 300 students 
burned an effigy of president reagan as well as a us flag 
but the antiamericanism of the radical students found no echo 
in the olympic stadium where the crowd gave one of its loudest 
accolades to the us team 
for south korea the games offered a worldwide showcase for its 
emergence from a developing country to an asian industrial power 
whose exports include computers automobiles and super tankers 
to guard against internal or external threats to the games 
south korea has marshalled a 120000man security force and placed 
its 650000member armed forces on heightened alert although not 
directly involved in olympic security the 40000member us 
ground forces were placed on increased alert and a us navy 
carrier task force patrolled off the coast 
south korea has stressed the games theme of reconciliation and 
of harmony and progress a theme symbolized in the omnipresent 
south korean flag at the center of which is a sunlike disc 
combining the opposing forces the red yin and the blue yang 
the strains of beethovens choral symphony lauding the 
brotherhood of man resounded through the stadium as the procession 
of olympic athletes got underway 
from his box which appeared to be enclosed in bulletproof 
glass roh rose to declare the games of the 24th olympiad 
officially open 
iran in line with its fundamental islamic beliefs was the only 
country in the procession to have a korean man not a woman carry 
the signboard bearing its name 
the first competitions scheduled for after the ceremony today 
were womens platform diving soccer mens volleyball mens 
basketball boxing and taekwondo a demonstration sport at these 
games 
the first gold medal was to be awarded sunday morning in the 
womens airrifle competition 
the united states soviet union and east germany were expected 
to garner the most medals 
as a prelude to the stadium ceremony today a flotilla of nearly 
400 boats sailed majestically on the nearby han river led by a 
dragon drum ship 
the stadium extravaganza involving 1500 performers blended 
taekwondo demonstrations ageold korean folk dances electronic 
synthesizers rock music and sky divers 
it also provided the first suspense of the games in the form of 
some white doves who perched on the unlit olympic torch basin as a 
platform carrying flamebearers rose upwards 
when the torch was lit exploding into an inferno the doves 
scattered and it could not be determined if any were killed

an attorney may seek a courtordered 
genetic test to determine if a 9yearold florida girl is the 
daughter of a pennsylvania couple who filed suit claiming a 
babyswitch conspiracy in 1978 
marvin ellin a baltimore malpractice lawyer said he will first 
ask the girls father to allow his daughter to be tested but will 
ask a court to mandate the test if he refuses the baltimore sun 
reported today 
the girls father said he would not allow her to be tested and 
that they had the wrong child 
the test would compare inherited factors in the girls blood 
with the blood chemistry of ernest and regina twigg of langhorne 
pa the twiggs are plaintiffs in a 100 million suit alleging 
three doctors and a nurse at hardee memorial hospital in wauchula 
fla switched their healthy baby girl with a child suffering from 
a congenital heart defect 
the small hospital also was named as a defendant in the federal 
suit 
mrs twigg said friday she will seek custody of the girl if she 
turns out to be her daughter and if she is not happy and safe the 
girl whose mother died of cancer seven years ago now lives with 
her father 
arlena the child mrs twigg brought home from the hospital 10 
years ago died aug 23 at the deborah heart and lung center in 
browns mills nj 
the twiggs discovered that arlenas type b blood made it 
unlikely she was their daughter since they have type o blood 
sophisticated proteinmatching tests at the johns hopkins 
immunogenetics laboratory in baltimore also concluded the child was 
unrelated to the twiggs 
a third test known as genetic fingerprinting is scheduled to 
begin next week 
the twiggs who have seven surviving children moved from 
central florida two years ago 
using public records the st petersburg times said friday it 
had located a blond blueeyed girl the only other white girl 
reported born at hardee memorial at the time regina twigg gave 
birth in a southwest florida city 
to protect the child the paper did not identify her 
relatives of the girl discount the notion that she was part of a 
babyswapping scheme 
my sympathy goes out to those people the girls father said 
thursday evening they have every right to pursue their real 
child my daughter is not their child she will never be 
their child 
the father told the newspaper he knew nothing of any baby swap 
he would not disclose his daughters blood type and said he would 
resist any attempts to draw the girl into the twiggs battle the 
girl knows nothing of the search for her 
until they get an indictment or a conviction i have 
nothing to say he said im an innocent bystander

clashes between the two nations 
officials of heihe in china and blagoveshchensk in the soviet 
union agreed daylong tours will be organized with the first group 
of 40 chinese crossing the river later this month the newspaper 
said two exchanges a month are planned between the two river towns 
in 1969 the two communist powers engaged in border fighting

premier li peng said today that a chinesesoviet 
summit can be held if lowerlevel meetings bring the two sides 
closer together on issues such as cambodia 
he also denied that the leadership is split over how to proceed 
with troubled economic reforms and said that reports of major 
resistance to reform are groundless 
the premier meeting with the associated press board of 
directors and executives said improved relations with moscow were 
in the interests of china and world peace and would not threaten 
chinas ties with japan and the west 
it was the most favorable chinese response yet to the soviet 
unions repeated invitations for a summit meeting to end a 
quartercentury of estrangement between the communist neighbors 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev renewed the invitation in a 
speech friday in siberia in which he said he was ready to begin 
summit preparations without delay 
the peoples daily and the official englishlanguage china daily 
reported gorbachevs offer without comment 
although li noted chinas longstanding three obstacles to a 
chinesesoviet summit he seemed to play down the differences while 
emphasizing that china would like very much to normalize 
relations 
the three obstacles are the soviet troop presence in 
afghanistan the nineyear occupation of cambodia by sovietallied 
vietnam and the heavy soviet troop presence on its border with 
china 
progress recently has been made in all three areas 
li speaking through an official interpreter at beijings 
diaoyutai state guesthouse said the most important issue was for 
vietnam to pull out of cambodia hanoi has already begun a partial 
troop withdrawal from the embattled country 
chinese and soviet negotiations who met last month to discuss 
cambodia were relatively close on the need for a vietnamese 
withdrawal he said 
it still takes a series of negotiations between the two sides 
to bring their views closer together li said once there is 
further agreement the subject of a summit meeting will be placed on 
the agenda 
china has consistently used the leverage of a potential summit 
meeting to try to resolve one of its primary security concerns the 
fear of an expansionist vietnam on its southern border 
li said chinesesoviet relations could not return to the 
comraderie of the 1950s when the two nations were close allies and 
the soviet union sent thousands of technicians to help develop 
industry in china which was devastated by a civil war 
the two countries split bitterly in the early 1960s over 
strategic and ideological differences 
li also sought to reassure japan and the west with whom china 
has developed friendly ties and trade in the past decade that they 
have nothing to fear from a sovietchinese rapproachment 
improvement of chinesesoviet relations will not impair 
relations between china and the united states and it will be in 
the interests of world peace li said 
in his 40minute interview li stressed that rumors going 
around the world of a serious rift in the chinese leadership were 
untrue all this is groundless he said 
li who heads the government claimed in particular that there 
is no political division between himself and zhao ziyang general 
secretary of the communist party 
li is regarded as more cautious toward reforms that will reduce 
the role of central planning in running the economy while zhao is 
thought to be chinas strongest advocate for bold steps to 
introduce marketoriented principles 
reports in the hong kong and western press have speculated that 
zhaos powers have declined as a result of the 20 percent inflation 
rate outofcontrol public spending panic buying and corruption 
that now plague the economy 
in the past month the government has taken several measures to 
calm consumers and cool off the economy including pegging bank 
interest rates to inflation to end runs on banks and pledging there 
will be no more price hikes this year 
li said these decisions were made by top party and government 
leaders under the directorship of general secretary zhao ziyang 
and some were proposed by him himself

a solidarity leader today said interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak told members of the independent labor 
movement that he sees a future for the banned group but refused to 
promise legalization 
wladyslaw frasyniuk described the sixhour meeting he attended 
friday and said the opposition side emerged with a feeling of 
victory 
at the meeting solidarity chairman lech walesa and government 
officials agreed to hold broadbased talks in midoctober to focus 
on national problems and the future of solidarity 
our positions got closer i am satisfied a tiredlooking 
walesa said after the meeting at a government guest house outside 
warsaw 
walesa last month persuaded striking workers to end a wave of 
walkouts after obtaining the governments agreement to hold talks 
he had not met with the government for six years 
for the first time friday other solidarity members and 
representatives of the official trade union alliance opzz were 
brought into talks to prepare for octobers discussions 
according to frasyniuk the leader of a solidarity chapter in 
the southwestern city of wroclaw gen kiszczak told opposition 
representatives that he sees a place for solidarity in polands 
future but could not take a decision now because his hands are tied 
alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek told the meeting 
there was strong resistance to the idea of legalizating solidarity 
among the police and army who fear this symbol according to 
frasyniuk 
they clearly said give us time frasyniuk said 
there was no immediate government confirmation of frasyniuks 
account 
frasyniuk told reporters that the union decided to continue 
talks even without a firm commitment because it did not want to be 
seen as being the first to break off the process of negotiation 
after the meeting participants had a feeling of victory he 
said you could see that the problem of solidarity was the 
dominant one and nobody directly attacked solidarity 
the trade union movement the first ever permitted in the soviet 
bloc was broken up in 1981 under martial law and later banned 
the meeting the second between walesa and communist authorities 
in two days was called to set terms for a roundtable meeting of 
groups including solidarity that represent various sectors of 
polish society they are to address major polish problems 
including the future of the outlawed solidarity and of trade union 
pluralism 
some bitter things were traded said mediator andrzej 
stelmachowski 
the recent labor unrest posed the most serious threat to 
solidarity since it was crushed in 1981 
stelmachowski a law professor who has been the gobetween in 
arranging the meetings reported that no decisions were taken but 
there was some progress 
in the soviet union meanwhile the staterun media softened 
their hardline support of the polish government saying both 
officials and protesters are to blame for many of polands problems 
and that the two should compromise 
the daily newspapers sovietskaya rossiya and izvestia carried 
commentaries friday suggesting that workers were driven to strike 
by the governments mishandling of sharp price increases in the 
spring 
sovietskaya rossiya said trust in polands government has eroded 
so badly that the leadership may not survive 
will the incumbent government stay in power or will it resign 
this issue has become a political reality and will be discussed by 
the polish parliament wrote v runov warsaw correspondent for 
the official tass news agency the dispatch appeared in sovietskaya 
rossiya

pope john paul ii today preached peace 
and reconciliation in northern mozambique where a 13year civil 
conflict has forced 1 million to flee and left 6 million at the 
edge of famine 
the roman catholic leader traveled from maputo the capital to 
this indian ocean port city in the devastated north where he 
celebrated mass before thousands of people including many refugees 
the pope lamented the prevailing situation of insecurity due 
to violence which generates violence anxiety and distress 
leaving limited space for freedom 
beira which has port and rail facilities that reach into 
landlocked african nations has been a frequent target of attacks 
by rebels of the mozambique national resistance known by their 
portuguese acronyn as renamo 
the rebels in a statement today from portugal claimed their 
troops killed 46 soldiers from mozambique and zimbabwe in the last 
30 days including one near vila de mungari southwest of beira 
rebel leader alfonso dhlakama also said he hoped the papal visit 
would contribute to peace in mozambique 
some mozambican bishops have been urging president joaquim 
chissanos marxist government to start talks with the rebels john 
paul told chissano friday night that the efforts of my brother 
bishops in mozambique have always received my backing 
the marxist government however has refused to negotiate and 
has criticized the bishops for advocating talk with armed 
bandits 
the weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively 
to defend our countrys freedom and our nation chissano told the 
pope 
the mozambican army assisted by zimbabwean forces has been 
able to keep the rail lines running for the past year 
renamo guerrillas also have been extremely active in nampula 
province where the pope will stop this afternoon for a meeting 
with local roman catholic clergy 
the conflict that started in 1975 between the government and the 
guerrillas has forced about 1 million mozambicans to flee into 
neighboring countries and left an estimated 6 million of 
mozambiques 145 million people in need of food aid according to 
relief organizations 
the antimarxist guerrillas believed to number between 
1200022000 are able to roam the countryside almost at will 
no government acknowledges assisting the rebels who have caused 
tremendous economic damage and have been accused of widespread 
civilian atrocities renamo denies the charges 
the us state department in a report released in april 
estimated the rebels had killed 100000 civilians in the past two 
to three years 
earlier this week renamo announced a unilateral ceasefire 
during the popes visit and wished the pontiff a good stay 
nonetheless mozambique announced extensive security measures for 
the pope and the pilgrims traveling to see him 
mozambique is the final stop on the popes 10day tour of 
southern africa he has visited zimbabwe botswana swaziland and 
lesotho and made a brief unscheduled stop in south africa after 
his plane was diverted in bad weather 
mozambique which also has been ravaged by drought in recent 
years receives most of its military assistance from the soviet 
union but increasingly has been making overtures to western 
nations 
the united states is the largest donor of food aid to 
mozambique and britain has been providing military training 
mozambique also has been working to improve relations with 
neighboring south africa which has backed renamo in the past 
south africa says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms 
of a 1984 mutual nonaggression pact but mozambique has continued 
to charge south africa with providing assistance

republicans are planning to whittle away at 
democraticproposed increases in the 335 minimum wage for the 
first time in eight years through a subminimum training wage 
but not until next week 
with many senators taking friday off to campaign for reelection 
in their home states sen orrin hatch rutah was unwilling to 
risk a vote on a democratic measure aimed at killing his proposal 
for a 80 percent subminimum wage 
under the hatch proposal employers could pay the training 
wage during the first 90 days a worker is on their payroll 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the chief author of the mininum 
wage bill was ready to vote friday on his proposal to double the 
number of student exemptions that employers can now use to pay 
parttime workers 15 percent below the wage floor or 285 an 
hour presently 
hatch called kennedys proposal a mock training wage saying 
it would would not give employers any incentive to open the door 
to those who have nothing who are undereducated and unskilled 
he said his subminimum training wage advocated by the reagan 
administration vice president george bush and bushs running mate 
sen dan quayle rind could create hundreds of thousands of 
new jobs 
with presidential and congressional elections just eight weeks 
away president reagan bush and other republicans have softened 
their opposition to any increase but have not said how large it 
should be 
in june quayle offered before the senate labor committee a 
proposed raise to 4 an hour over two years but coupled it with a 
subminimum training wage the measure was never voted on 
bush campaigning in ohio said friday that a lower training 
wage the administrations euphemism for a subminimum rate that it 
has advocated since 1981 must accompany any increase for him to 
support it 
kennedy called the republican proposals a trojan horse saying 
quayles proposal for a 4 minimum wage amounts to a 10 percent cut 
in buying power after taking inflation into account from when 
reagan and bush took office 
and from that miserly floor he proposes a further cut for all 
new hires kennedy said can this be what george bush means 
when he talks about a kinder gentler america 
kennedys bill would raise the minimum wage 40 cents an hour in 
each of the next three years to 375 in 1989 415 in 1990 and 
455 in 1991 directly benefitting about 15 million workers now 
paid less than 450 an hour 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva said he hoped to get a 
vote on kennedys and hatchs different subminimum proposals next 
tuesday and a vote on final passage by the end of next week 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the house will take up 
and likely pass it as soon as the senate acts

a state appeals court that upheld the fraud 
conviction of salvatore bill bonnano rejected a claim by the 
son of reputed mafia boss joseph bonnano that he was the victim of 
discriminatory prosecution 
a 30 decision of the 1st district court of appeal on friday 
upheld the 1985 conviction and fouryear prison sentence of the 
younger bonnano for cheating elderly residents out of 45000 in a 
home improvement scheme 
although another man anthony insana committed most of the acts 
in the scheme and was given immunity from prosecution for his 
testimony the jury could well have concluded that bonnano was 
often the motivating force behind insanas ripoffs said the 
opinion by justice william newsom 
the ruling also said bonnano had failed to prove that 
authorities were out to get him because of his notorious family 
background 
prosecutors said bonnano and insana cooperated in a scheme to 
cheat customers of insanas contracting company the victims were 
homeowners most of them elderly who bought home improvement 
contracts 
largely through the testimony of insana bonnano was convicted 
of eight grand theft charges involving 45700 taken from four 
people between october 1977 and january 1978 and of conspiracy to 
commit grand theft he was acquitted of 10 other grand theft 
charges 
the appeals judges rejected bonnanos argument that the 
convictions were improperly based on the uncorroborated testimony 
of an accomplice insana they also rejected bonnanos claim that 
insana should have been declared incompetent to testify because he 
was allegedly an alcoholic

radical students demonstrating against 
the olympic games and the government have seen their support 
dwindle to a handful of diehards and most koreans have rejected 
their violent extremism 
the radical movement has lost ground as hope grows in south 
korea that political reforms will end the nations long tradition 
of authoritarian rule and produce an enduring democratic system 
many koreans including a growing number of students say 
violent antigovernment protests are no longer necessary people 
are increasingly critical of the radicals 
students know the people are against these demonstrations a 
student leader said 
demonstrations against the olympics which began saturday have 
been small by korean standards with the turnout dropping each day 
protests have been confined to campuses away from the olympic 
venues and many have been peaceful 
the government helped to defuse the protests by ordering riot 
police to avoid clashes if possible and not to use tear gas during 
the olympics radicals marching out of colleges for violent 
protests several times found no police waiting to confront them and 
ended up dispersing in confusion 
but violence has not disappeared completely protesting radicals 
hurled firebombs at runners escorting the olympic torch to seoul 
last week but failed to stop it on saturday riot police beat 
radical students who staged an antiolympic protest in the heart of 
seoul about 20 protesters were arrested 
student leaders say the olympics should have been shared with 
communist north korea to help reunite the korean peninsula they 
claimed the games were being used to keep the two koreas divided 
we must oppose singlehost olympics which prolong dictatorship 
and perpetuate nation division said a student leader who like 
other radicals spoke on condition of anonymity 
north korea boycotted the olympics after its demand to cohost 
the games was rejected the peninsula was divided in 1945 
the radicals hoped to use the games to continue antigovernment 
protests by claiming they were being used to cement authoritarian 
rule radicals say president roh taewoos government is a front 
for military rule and insist there have been no political reforms 
the olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime 
one student leader told a recent demonstration 
roh a former general who took office in february introduced 
broad reforms and most forms of political activity are now legal 
after years of repression even the main opposition parties agree 
that roh is making an effort to build democracy 
the changing political climate began to erode support for the 
radical movement this year once the spearhead for political change 
in south korea the movement began losing many students because 
they no longer saw the need for violent protests 
the departure of moderate students enabled leftist hardliners to 
take control of the student groups the hardliners have attempted 
to compensate for their smaller numbers with more violent tactics 
but the call for antiolympic protests has attracted little 
support 
top opposition leader kim daejung said even the radical leaders 
realize that the great majority of south koreans want the games to 
be a success koreans see the olympics as a way to put the country 
in the front rank of nations 
the students know they will not be supported by our people 
kim said in an interview 
onlookers have jeered protesting radicals at several 
demonstrations criticizing them for ruining south koreas image at 
a time when world attention was focused on the country 
go home you are shaming our nation screamed an angry old 
man at protesters at one demonstration 
while the radicals have lost support political observers say 
they cannot be ignored because of their willingness to use 
violence a change in the political situation or loss of confidence 
in the government could revive the radicals support they add 
radicals form less than 10 percent of about 1 million college 
students other students may like some of the radicals ideas but 
reject their violent tactics 
the radicals come from all social and economic backgrounds 
children of senior officials and military officers join children of 
workers and poor farmers in campus groups united by a common 
idealism and anger over years of oppressive rule 
the radicals say they are fighting for creation of an idealistic 
society of the masses with students workers and peasants 
uniting to end oppression poverty and exploitation but the 
radicals often are vague about their goals 
we feel in our hearts that something must be done now people 
just talk and the government uses that to continue its rule we 
must act to force change said one leader

subscribers to index on censorship got a surprise 
this month instead of the usual reports of suppression of free 
speech by dictatorships the entire issue of the small but 
respected journal was devoted to britain 
it reflected growing alarm among editors broadcasters and civil 
libertarians that prime minister margaret thatchers government is 
adding censorship to britains already extensive official secrecy 
from repeated attempts to suppress news about northern ireland 
to a worldwide government campaign to ban the publication of an 
intelligence veterans memoirs the list of recent controversies 
over media freedom has grown dramatically 
if freedom is diminished in the united kingdom where 
historically it has deep roots it is potentially diminished 
everywhere wrote matthew hoffman an assistant editor of the 
independent newspaper hoffman edited the special issue of the 
index of censorship a monthly journal on freedom of speech and 
censorship 
mrs thatcher insists she is trying to bolster national 
security deny terrorists a platform and restore discipline to a 
leaky civil service but during her nineyear tenure britain has 
gained a reputation as the most secretive of the western 
democracies 
secrecy from the top of our society to the bottom is 
preventing newspapers from telling the public what is really 
happening the guild of british newspaper editors charged in a 
recent report officially secret 
the problem was underscored when mrs thatcher ignored calls to 
explain a mysterious incident in which a cuban diplomat was 
expelled last week after firing a gun on a london street 
those who felt the public was entitled to know why lives were 
put in danger received a stock response the government never 
makes statements on matters relating to national security 
the march shooting of three irish republican army members on a 
bombing mission in gibraltar also stirred the secrecy debate 
when two british television companies turned up witness 
accounts suggesting soldiers deliberately shot to death the three 
men instead of trying to arrest them the government pressured the 
networks to suppress the films arguing they would prejudice the 
inquest 
the networks refused and the films were screened on schedule 
other incidents have raised concern over official secrecy 
a police raid on british broadcasting corp studios to seize 
tapes of a documentary about a secret spy satellite 
a legal bid this year to stop bbc radio broadcasting from 
interviews with current and former members of the intelligence 
services 
the confiscation of unscreened tv film of street violence in 
belfast a court order delaying screening of a film about an 
irarelated trial 
the banning of a bbc film about an ira sympathizer that 
provoked a oneday protest strike at the bbc 
overshadowing all for sheer cost and persistence is the thatcher 
administrations worldwide twoyear court battle to suppress 
spycatcher the memoirs of retired intelligence operative peter 
wright 
mrs thatcher says she is defending a principle the lifelong 
oath of secrecy taken by secret agents she has lost her battle in 
foreign courts but in britain it drags on the guardian and 
observer newspapers are still fighting in court to publish extracts 
of spycatcher 
in bath southern england bookseller peter marsh this month 
received a summons for contempt of court for selling copies of 
spycatcher that had been imported from ireland 
marsh works alone and said he could be bankrupted by legal 
costs but added in a telephone interview i sell books its my 
living and i dont see why i should be deprived of that right 
because of some overweening authority 
since coming to office in 1979 mrs thatchers government has 
used the allembracing 1911 official secrets act in at least 24 
prosecutions compared with 34 the previous 68 years the act makes 
it an offense for a civil servant to disclose any information 
however trivial without authorization 
the government has unveiled a proposed reform confining the act 
mainly to defense intelligence and foreign relations matters 
saying this would dispel any notion it was being used to protect 
the government from embarrassment 
but the proposals reinforce the lifetime gag on intelligence 
officers and shield the intelligence services from any 
parliamentary scrutiny 
some newspapers have responded by printing sensitive stories 
under headlines pointing out that under the new law such stories 
will be unpublishable 
novelist john mortimer wrote in index of censorship in 
healthier days most newspapers attacked the government of the 
day whichever government it might be now however too many 
journalists censor themselves 
maurice frankel chairman of the campaign for freedom of 
information which is pressing for a usstyle law said press 
freedom is deteriorating and its notable how relatively little 
opposition theres been from the press itself 
ronald dworkin professor of jurisprudence at oxford university 
concluded in index on censorship censorship is no longer an 
isolated exception the sad truth is that the very concept of 
liberty is being challenged and corroded by the thatcher 
government

attending a school where the ratio of 
women to men is 63to1 may seem like heaven to some young men but 
for the first seven fulltime male students admitted to centenary 
college in 78 years it can be a little strange 
ken strauss a 21yearold junior from mount olive acknowledged 
that he was a little uncomfortable with all girls in class but 
said he was able to adjust by the time he attended his second class 
after school opened sept 7 
strauss a psychology and elementary education major recalls 
how a female student saw him standing outside a classroom and 
mistook him for the professor 
most of the girls are friendly it seems like they know me 
more than i know them said richard west 21 a freshman business 
major 
west said his decision to attend the school was supported by all 
his friends except his girlfriend who is a sophomore 
shes not too happy about my going here west said 
west doesnt expect to be distracted by his female counterparts 
or at least not so much on my part but on the girls part because 
im the new element 
centenary college was founded in this northwestern new jersey 
town as a coeducational preparatory school in 1867 admission was 
limited to girls in 1910 and centenary became a womens junior 
college in 1940 the fouryear college was formed in 1976 and men 
were allowed to enroll only in the continuing education division 
consisting mainly of night classes in april the trustees decided 
to admit male students full time 
dorothy prisco vice president for academic affairs and dean of 
the college said the board decided it was the right time and the 
right circumstances to admit men full time 
she said the school responded to the success of the continuing 
education division and the fact that male students were requesting 
admission to fulltime programs 
we felt very strongly that we were operating from a foundation 
of constraints and that it was the time to go coeducational she 
said 
it certainly broadens the perspective of the classes ms 
prisco said the teaching challenge i think becomes greater 
the richness of discussion in class becomes greater it brings a 
whole new perspective 
however it doesnt mean that we are going to forsake our 
mission of providing a strong education for women i dont think we 
have to give up one for the other 
total enrollment is about 450 students there were 192 incoming 
students in 1987 down from 235 in 1986 and 261 in 1985 according 
to admissions department statistics 
adding male minds to the campus will not precipitate changes in 
the curriculum ms prisco said 
i think we have strong academic programs and i think thats 
why we have the seven male students because theyve realized 
our programs are strong she said 
all seven are commuters but dormitory space for men will be 
available in 1989 ms prisco said 
john stowe 23 a transfer student who lives within walking 
distance said he decided to attend centenary because it is a 
small private school 
i enjoy the campus and its terribly convenient for me he 
said its been a really neat experience for me but it is a 
little strange walking into a room full of girls and not seeing 
another guy there 
stowes girlfriend also is not too happy with his choice of 
academic institutions 
shes not pleased a bit but shes getting over that he said

president corazon aquino said 
saturday the united states must decide whether to accept a soviet 
offer and close its bases here in return for a soviet pullout from 
a strategic garrison in vietnam 
on friday soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev offered to abandon 
its naval facilities in cam ranh bay if the united states removed 
its six military installations from the philippines 
that is for the two superpowers to discuss and to talk 
about mrs aquino told reporters she gave no indication whether 
her government will make any recommendation to washington over the 
soviet offer 
other filipino officials also reacted cautiously to gorbachevs 
offer which was part of a sevenpoint plan for reducing tensions 
in asia 
gorbachevs proposal came during growing opposition to the bases 
here and against the backdrop of deadlocked usphilippine talks 
over the future of the installations which include clark air base 
subic bay naval base and four smaller installations 
talks between the united states and the philippines over the 
final two years of the 1947 military bases agreement have stalled 
over compensation and other issues 
on thursday us secretary of state george shultz said in 
washington that the united states wanted to keep clark subic and 
four other installations in the philippines but that manilas 
demands for more money were too high 
shultz met this week in washington with filipino foreign 
secretary raul manglapus to discuss the impasse but neither side 
announced any progress 
the united states pays about 180 million a year for use of the 
six bases manglapus has said the americans have offered about 502 
million in compensation but he said the philippine demand for 12 
billion a year would be a reasonable figure 
the agreement expires in 1991 and mrs aquino has refused to 
say whether she will allow the bases to remain after that 
in a statement to reporters sen leticia shahani chairman of 
the senate foreign relations committee said soviet and us 
military facilities were not comparable and that the clark and 
subic bases were far bigger complexes than cam ranh bay 
two other senators heherson alvarez and rene saguisag welcomed 
the gorbachev proposal but warned that the issue would require 
careful study 
in other developments the government announced saturday that 
mrs aquino ordered the cancellation of the passport of the founder 
of the outlawed communist party of the philippines after the 
military claimed he had resumed leadership of the rebel movement 
the statement released by the presidential palace said mrs 
aquino issued the order friday against jose maria sison whom she 
freed from prison in 1986 sison left the country six months later 
and is believed to be in western europe 
the military said sison has been soliciting funds for the rebels 
abroad 
sison founded the maoist party in 1968 and was arrested in 1977 
he was among about 500 political prisoners released by mrs aquino 
in march 1986 one month after a civilianmilitary uprising toppled 
ferdinand marcos and propelled her to power 
the party and its armed wing the new peoples army have been 
waging a 19year insurgency to establish a marxist state in the 
philippines 
elsewhere the military said suspected rebels led by a fugitive 
roman catholic priest ambushed a government jeep in the southern 
philippines killing five people 
col rogelio villanueva regional army commander said the 
attack occurred friday in the coastal town of cortes in surigao del 
sur province about 510 miles southeast of manila 
villanueva said about 30 guerrillas opened fire on the national 
irrigation administration jeep as it passed by on an isolated strip 
of the national highway 
villanueva quoted the survivors as saying the rebel band was led 
by renegade priest frank navarro one of the best known clerics who 
have joined the rebellion

george bush has dropped a line from his stock 
campaign speech the one about being the underdog and liking it 
little more than a month ago the vice president was trailing 
democrat michael dukakis in national public opinion polls by double 
digits now most polls show bush has seized the agenda and is 
either leading dukakis or is even with him 
political professionals offer differing explanations for bushs 
rapid rise but most suggest a combination of factors his 
wellreceived convention address a series of speeches that put 
dukakis on the defensive and the failure of questions over running 
mate dan quayles military record to stick as a major liability 
some analysts also cite quick damage control on the part of 
bushs campaign team led by campaign chairman james a baker iii 
in minimizing possible embarrassments such as the quick 
resignations last week of bush operative frederic malek and six 
members of an ethnic coalition after allegations of antisemitic 
activities surfaced 
bush himself says hes doing a better job now in getting 
through to the american people both in terms of personality and 
message and that theres a good sense the campaign is on the 
move 
the speed of the vice presidents rally was welcomed by campaign 
officials 
all of us had a lot of confidence in him and a lot of 
confidence the campaign would start moving in the right direction 
but all of us were surprised how fast it did campaign manager 
lee atwater said 
atwater credits bushs convention acceptance speech in which 
he appealed for a kinder gentler nation and moved out from the 
shadow of president reagan as decisive in bushs surge 
private analysts agree the speech was important but suggest 
other factors for bushs rise including a major miscalculation on 
the part of dukakis strategists on the impact of the quayle 
controversy 
there is an old political axiom never murder anyone when 
theyre committing suicide said norman ornstein a political 
analyst with the american enterprise institute there was a 
tactical judgment in the dukakis campaign to lay low for a few 
weeks or play presidential 
but that didnt work very well since the quayle episode 
hasnt done the damage to george bush that one might have 
imagined ornstein said then they dukakis campaign were 
flatfooted when bush went aggressively on attack 
quayle aside bush roared out of new orleans with a series of 
speeches that depicted dukakis as a liberal who is soft on crime 
and quick to raise taxes the dukakis campaign did little to 
respond 
some republicans said the furor over reports that quayle used 
family influence to join the indiana national guard during the 
vietnam war era may have actually worked to the tickets advantage 
republican consultant david carmen said people were very 
sympathetic to quayle and didnt understand what all the fuss was 
they were getting no news about dukakis and there was a lot of 
sympathy for this guy 
democratic consultant david garth disagreed and said the 
selection of quayle was without doubt the dumbest move the bush 
campaign has made it was dumb to pick him and dumb to stick with 
him 
my feeling is that had bush picked anybody else but quayle 
the election would be over today with dukakis the loser garth 
said 
he said bushs rise in the polls reflected a very good speech 
at the convention and what he contended were misleading polls 
that showed dukakis ahead of bush earlier in the summer 
dukakis appeared to be ahead only because of a false bump he 
got from public attention to his lengthy primary battle against 
jesse jackson then the only question left was whether jackson 
would cause trouble at the democratic convention and when he 
didnt it gave another spurt to dukakis garth said 
other analysts suggested that dukakis lack of movement in the 
polls reflects a common political phenomenon a problem that in 
fact affected bush in his 1980 presidential bid a relatively 
unknown candidate gets a big surge in the polls from winning 
primaries then sees it evaporate as voters get to know more about 
the candidate and lose their initial curiosity

robert bud mcfarlane who was white house 
national security adviser in 1983 when president reagan launched 
the star wars initiative says the administration engaged in 
romantic and hyperbolic hyperbole to exaggerate the potential 
of spacebased defenses 
truly impressive gains have been made in the technologies 
associated with ballistic missile defense since the late 1960s 
mcfarlane wrote in the fall issue of foreign affairs magazine 
yet there is no basis for saying that any of these systems 
will be adaptable as effective weapons systems before the turn of 
the century except for two traditional groundbased 
interceptors said mcfarlane who was reagans national security 
adviser 198385 
mcfarlane said that he was among the white house advisers who 
urged reagan to outline the star wars plan formally known as the 
strategic defense initiative during a march 1983 speech on defense 
issues 
the presidents speech provoked a firestorm of debate and in 
the five years since then have been marked by bitter passionate 
advocacy and criticism he said 
initially mcfarlane said the debate was polarized by on the 
one hand the romantic and manipulative hyperbole of the 
administration and on the other by the flatly dismissive rhetoric 
of scientists who should have known better 
in answer to the question can defensive technologies provide 
the means to defend us against ballistic missile attack said 
mcfarlane we do not know and cannot know for the next 10 to 15 
years 
despite the sometimes misguided political debate that followed 
reagans star wars speech in 1983 said mcfarlane the initiative 
helped force the soviets back to the negotiating table nudged them 
toward 50 percent cuts in strategic arms and may have prompted them 
to into economic reforms 
mcfarlane wrote that those of us in the white house who 
proposed the strategic defense initiative believe that a 
reorientation of our investment strategy to emphasize an area of 
our comparative advantage excellence in high technology could 
persuade the soviets that we could outstrip an entire generation of 
soviet military investment 
if we could do so we could remove their only claim to 
superpower status and perhaps lead them to deal more constructively 
with our concerns about their strategic rocket forces he said 
the soviets commitment to a 50percent reduction in their 
heavy missile launchers and warheads a possibility they would not 
discuss seriously until after sdi was proposed represents a 
vindication of that strategy wrote mcfarlane 
mcfarlane a former marine corps officer resigned from the 
national security council staff in december 1985 and is now a 
counselor at the center for strategic and international studies in 
washington 
he pleaded guilty in march to four counts of misleading congress 
about the irancontra affair in which the administration sent arms 
to iran in hopes of winning freedom for american hostages in 
lebanon

troops opened fire on antigovernment 
protesters who surrounded the ministry of trade today but later 
surrendered to the students and buddhist monks who occupied the 
downtown building witnesses said 
after the soldiers surrendered they were disguised as 
protesters so they could escape witnesses said elsewhere three 
people accused of offering poisoned water to demonstrators two 
weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and beheaded after the 
monks released them from their custody witnesses said 
three people were slightly wounded in the shooting at the 
ministry the witnesses said the first known by troops in rangoon 
against antigovernment protestors since a bloody but ineffective 
military crackdown last month 
the incident at the ministry occurred while as many as half a 
million students striking government employees monks and 
policemen took to the streets to demand the end to 26 years of 
authoritarian rule 
two other government buildings nearby city hall and the central 
bank were ringed by demonstrators but there was apparently no 
bloodshed although some reported hearing shots fired about 100 
soldiers stood guard at each building 
a small number of soldiers guarding the trade ministry opened 
fire on a surging crowd which surrounded the building and 
threatened to set it afire 
clambering over adjacent rooftops students entered the top 
floor of the fourstory structure according to eyewitness 
accounts 24 soldiers inside the building surrendered to monks and 
were disguised as students wearing red headbands to get them past 
the mob outside 
the soldiers were driven away possibly to a nearby monastery 
and the monks seized one machine gun and several semiautomatic 
weapons 
today was not the first time soldiers sided with the 
demonstrators on sept 9 500 servicemen marched with protesters 
in rangoon in the first major military defection smaller 
defections also occurred in the provinces 
 
three people alleged to have offered poisoned water to 
demonstrators two weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and 
beheaded after being released from the custody of monks witnesses 
said 
some opposition leaders who are believed to be negotiating with 
president maung maungs government were attempting to stop mob 
violence from escalating on friday one key opposition figure 
aung gyi defused a potentially bloody confrontation between 
soldiers and demonstrators moving on the ministry of defense armed 
with spears swords and knives 
they dont seem to be afraid of the guns they are angry and 
frustrated said one burmese intellectual watching the 
demonstrators facing off against riflearmed troops friday 
the renewed protests indicated the general rangoon population 
was unsatisfied with the reforms offered by the government 
the stateowned radio rangoon announced friday that all military 
personnel and civil servants had to resign from the ruling burma 
socialist program party and refrain from membership in all future 
political parties 
the decision the radio said was made at the recommendation of 
a recently formed election commission which is to suprevise 
multiparty elections in about three months the opposition has 
rejected this move saying an interim government must be formed 
before elections can take place 
about twothirds of the 25 million members of the burma 
socialist program party come from military and civil service ranks 
several burmese government employees said today they would defy 
a government order that they return to work by sept 26 or face 
dismissal 
virtually all government employees including some police and 
military personnel have been on strike since aug 8 
earlier today the demonstrators marched in welldisciplined 
peaceful lines and carried placards with antigovernment slogans 
such as if we dont get it democracy we will hit out 
when smaller numbers of protesters confronted troops at the 
three government buildings messages were quickly sent out and 
shortly the demonstrators were reinforced by others from nearby 
areas 
massive protests began after authoritarian leader ne win who 
seized power in 1962 resigned in july his replacement hardliner 
sein lwin attempted to restore calm by ordering the military to 
fire on protesters but he resigned 17 days later on aug 19 the 
relatively moderate maung maung became burmas first civilian 
leader in a quartercentury

israeli troops killed one palestinian and 
wounded 24 in the occupied lands today arab sources said as 
residents observed a general strike to mark a massacre of 
palestinians in lebanon six years ago 
today also was the 10th anniversary of the signing of the camp 
david accords which called for palestinian selfrule in the 
occupied lands and paved the way for the israeliegyptian peace 
treaty of march 1979 
prime minister yitzhak shamir issued a statement on the accords 
saying 
these agreements created a turning point in the history of the 
middle east they proved that its possible to achieve peace 
between israel and its neighbors that the hatred which prevailed 
is not eternal 
egypt marked the anniversary by once again blaming israeli 
intransigence for the accords failure to give the palestinians 
in the occupied lands a voice in ruling themselves 
but except for the bitterly worded statement by butros ghali 
minister of state for foreign affairs the anniversary passed 
largely unnoticed in cairo 
underground leaders of the palestinian uprising called for the 
general strike to mark the massacre of hundreds of palestinians in 
beiruts sabra and chatilla refugee camps by israelibacked 
christian militiamen in september 1982 the strike turned violent 
in several towns and villages 
in jenin dozens of palestinians blocked the road with stones 
and burning tires and threw rocks at passing military vehicles an 
arab reporter said 
troops opened fire with rubber bullets and tear gas when the 
rioters failed to disperse the soldiers opened fire with real 
bullets killing 18yearold emad arkawi a military spokesman 
confirmed a dead palestinian was brought to the hospital but said 
the army was investigating the circumstances 
arkawi was the 267th palestinian to die since the intefadeh 
arabic for uprising began nine months ago six israelis have also 
been killed 
arab reporters said three palestinians between the ages of 17 
and 20 including one woman were wounded in the incident 
another 21 palestinians were wounded at least one critically 
in clashes with troops in other parts of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
the army said it was investigating the reports 
the general strike was fully observed throughout the occupied 
territories 
in jenin palestinians painted graffiti in arabic and hebrew 
saying death to the jews and the end is near it was the 
first time arab insurgents have painted graffiti in hebrew 
palestinian flags outlawed by israel flew from the homes of many 
jenin residents 
in all the cities of the occupied territories workers stayed 
away from their jobs transportation ground to a halt and the 
streets were deserted 
in gaza city palestinian flags were hoisted on electricity 
wires and protesters burned tires protesters littered the highway 
linking gaza and khan yunis with nails to prevent cars from 
travelling

the organization of american states facing 
the worst financial crisis of its history may be forced to lay off 
as many as 300 of its 1000 employees over the next few months 
according to oas sources 
the crisis is based largely on the reagan administrations 
decision to reduce its 1988 contribution to the oas by 10 million 
and by the same amount next year compounding the problem is the 
failure of several other major contributors including chile and 
venezuela to keep their payments current the sources said 
the impending layoffs have generated gloom and uncertainty among 
oas employees most of whom are latin americans who are faced with 
the prospect of the immediate loss of their us visas if their 
jobs are eliminated 
the staff is terribly worried said arturo garzon a mexican 
who is president of the oas staff association 
he noted that many of the employees are longtime residents of 
the washington area and would have to start from scratch if forced 
to return with their families to their native lands 
they are facing a terrible family situation garzon said 
the oas whose origins date back 99 years is designed to 
enhance cooperation among the united states and more than 30 other 
countries in latin america and the caribbean 
in its heyday the oas was seen by successive us 
administrations as a vital tool for combatting communism in the 
hemisphere but the united states has largely ignored the 
organization in recent years this is partly because the 
anticommunist consensus among member states has eroded over the 
years 
president reagan bypassed the oas in october 1983 when he 
decided to join forces with several other caribbean countries in 
toppling the leftist government of grenada 
neither the united states nor nicaragua has looked to the oas as 
an appropriate forum for achieving a settlement to their 
longrunning dispute 
the united states with 85 per cent of the combined gross 
national product of oas member states has a quota of about 40 
million or 66 per cent of the organizations annual budget of 
about 65 million 
the money is used to pay for programs in such fields as human 
rights education and drug abuse among others 
but the reagan administration faced with its own budgetary 
woes informed the oas last may that it was reneging on 10 million 
of its 1988 quota the money was reallocated to cover a foreign 
exchange shortfall that us diplomatic missions in europe had 
experienced as a result of the declining value of the dollar 
the oas sources said the second blow came more recently when the 
united states decided to cut 10 million from its 1989 quota 
we have to decide every month which bills well pay said 
one oas official insisting on anonymity he predicted the layoffs 
would be announced around january 1 after decisions are made on 
which programs should receive priority 
joao baena soares a brazilian who has served as oas secretary 
general since 1984 was unavailable for comment on the crisis but 
he told one interviewer recently that the situation is so serious 
the essence of the organization is in danger 
said garzon we have dedicated our lives to the benefit of the 
hemisphere but we are disposable

tourists are flying out and medicine 
plastic tents and food are pouring in at jamaicas two 
international airports as this island nation struggles to recover 
from the fury of hurricane gilbert 
little by little jamaica home to 23 million people is 
struggling back from the worst disaster in its history but its 
going to be a slow and painful process 
the confirmed death toll of 26 was low in comparison with 
hurricane charlie which hit jamaica in 1951 and killed more than 
150 people but charlie caused less physical damage prime minister 
edward seaga has estimated losses at 8 billion and called gilbert 
the worst disaster in the nations history 
the government say 500000 people or twofifths of the 
population have been left homeless after the hurricane roared down 
the spine of the 144milelong island on monday four out of every 
five houses were either damaged or destroyed as gilberts 145 mph 
winds tore away zinc roofs as if they were plastic sheets 
ninetythree percent of the island still had no electricity 
saturday although power was restored in the northern coast city of 
montego bay the main tourist area 
the power failure cut off fresh water supplies to most of the 
island including kingston a city of 750000 people because the 
pumping and filtration plants run on electricity power was not 
expected to be fully restored to the capital for at least two weeks 
crowds gathered around water hydrants and burst mains in 
90degree heat filling plastic buckets and old milk containers 
reports from the countryside said people were taking water from 
muddy streams despite the hazard of contamination 
radio stations carried a taped message every half hour from the 
health minister dr kenneth baugh warning people to boil drinking 
water and millions of water purification tablets were being 
airlifted in from around the world 
looting of stores warehouses and supermarkets in the first days 
after the hurricane forced the government to impose a night curfew 
which was still in effect at the end of the week people who failed 
to stock up before the storm rushed supermarkets and gasoline 
stations forming long lines outside both armed soldiers were seen 
regulating the flow of shoppers in and out of a supermarket outside 
kingston 
on thursday seaga declared a 30day state of public emergency 
ordering stores and gasoline stations to reopen and giving security 
forces full but unspecified power to ensure that they did 
the emergency order also gave the government the right to seize 
transportation and heavy equipment to distribute supplies arriving 
from around the world 
the loss to agriculture is severe government officials said the 
poultry industry and this yearss crop of bananas and coffee were 
wiped out 
seaga told reporters friday that he would discuss the disaster 
with world bank officials next week but had no plan to ask for a 
rescheduling of jamaicas 4 billion foreign debt 
the disaster hit just as jamaica was showing signs of recovery 
from economic distress brought on by a worldwide slump in the value 
of bauxite sugar and other commodities 
in addition tourism now the nations biggest foreign exchange 
earner at 550 million a year had staged a remarkable recovery as 
a result of an intense campaign to rid the island of its reputation 
for political violence

seaga said the area was making a quick recovery and the tourist 
industry was generally in good shape

a 100000 reward is on the table and 
nearly 1 million has been paid in ransom but authorities say they 
still havent gotten a break in the kidnapping of the ailing wife 
of a jackson multimillionaire 
earlier this month fbi officials released a statement by robert 
m hearin offering the reward and asking for the safe return of his 
wife 72yearold annie laurie hearin who was abducted from their 
home july 26 
mrs hearin suffers from intestinal ileitis a disease that can 
result in lifethreatening complications without medication 
nothing is new said police department spokesman sgt chip 
pippen to my knowledge at least in the police department weve 
had no response to the reward 
fbi agent wayne taylor said federal authorities had nothing new 
to report 
the investigation is ongoing at this time he said the 
community is concerned but we just have nothing to report 
since mrs hearins disappearance the only word from her has 
been a letter which the fbi said was in her handwriting with an 
atlanta postmark 
hearin could not be reached for comment calls to his home were 
not answered 
a typed ransom note was left at the house when mrs hearin was 
abducted small spots of blood were found inside and outside the 
front door of the twostory house 
the crudely phrased note the only direct word from the 
kidnappers instructed hearin to pay an unspecified amount of money 
to 12 people he had allegedly wronged 
the people named in the letter are current or former franchisers 
with school pictures of mississippi inc which handles portraits 
of school children of which hearin was once the largest 
stockholder the company filed suit against the 12 in the early 
1980s claiming they owed money from operating loans materials and 
film processing fees 
hearin researched the monetary amounts involved in the lawsuits 
to decide how much to pay each of the 12 although neither the fbi 
nor hearin has said exactly how much was paid the payments 
totaled nearly one million dollars according to hearins aug 
23 statement 
the story of the kidnapping was voluntarily embargoed by the 
news media for about 30 hours because officials believed publicity 
might endanger the victim the kidnapping was disclosed at a news 
conference july 28 after family members decided to go public 
because of the vagueness of the demands in the ransom note 
on aug 23 fbi officials announced that hearin had followed the 
instructions and that payment had been mailed to the 12 named in 
the letter or their survivors on aug 16 the day after hearin 
received the letter from his wife 
the letter promised that mrs hearin would be returned if the 
payments were made 
taylor said he could not comment on whether any of the 12 people 
had returned the money at least one lawyer n alfred winn of st 
petersburg fla reportedly did send back a check he received 
from hearin 
hearins worth reportedly exceeds 100 million in addition to 
being coowner of mississippi valley gas co he and his partner 
new jersey oil man leon hess own controlling interest in lamar 
life corp a life insurance company which is the largest 
stockholder in trustmark national bank mississippis 
secondlargest financial institution 
mark dale lead researcher for unsolved mysteries nbctvs 
series on unsolved crimes said producers plan to broadcast a 
segment about the kidnapping this fall if mrs hearin is not found 
last year the segments produced tips that led to the capture of 
nine fugitives and solving of eight cases

rep ken gray says that in his southern 
illinois district support for the national rifle association is 
almost as strong as for the pledge of allegiance 
so when the nra told grays constituents to make sure he voted 
against a waiting period for handgun purchases they responded 
a week ago they surrounded his car in the district and 
virtually kept him prisoner inside until he promised to help strip 
the waiting period from an antidrug bill 
they repeated verbatim all the nra arguments especially the 
fear that this was the beginning of the end of gun ownership 
last thursday the illinois democrat was part of the 228182 
majority that voted to eliminate from an antidrug bill a sevenday 
waiting period for handgun purchases and an optional background 
check of the buyer the house substituted a requirement that the 
justice department develop a system for gun dealers to check 
whether buyers are convicted felons 
grays case more than almost any other shows just how powerful 
the tug of the nra can be 
he has no fear of defeat because hes not running for 
reelection due to health reasons 
he said he personally supports a waiting period and believes his 
constituents were brainwashed by the nra 
and he had an emotional reason to support the waiting period 
since two of his longtime friends and former constituents are jim 
and sarah brady 
the waiting period is symbolically named after jim brady the 
presidential press secretary who was shot along with president 
reagan in the march 30 1981 attempt on reagans life sarah brady 
is the vice chair of handgun control inc which joined the 
nations major law enforcement organizations to lobby hard for the 
waiting period 
so why did gray vote with the nra 
in his district gray said after the pledge of allegiance 
the nra comes next if im their spokesman im not going to pull a 
holier than thou routine im sitting here as a hired hand 
the tug of the nra wasnt as direct on all house members but it 
was there nonetheless 
rep helen delich bentley rmd is a strongwilled lawmaker 
who would never be called a wimp by her colleagues a cosponsor of 
the drug bill that contained the brady language she said she told 
nra backers i supported brady and leave me alone 
ms bentley said in an interview she was not pressured by the 
nra but when the voting began she watched the nra supporters pile 
up an increasing margin for their substitute language 
when the pronra count reached a majority she decided she 
couldnt be of help to the waitingperiod forces bowing to the 
inevitable she inserted her electronic card into a slot that cast 
her vote for the nras position 
i wanted to see what would happen she said i told sarah 
brady a long time ago i would support her amendment but i made a 
decision to vote depending on what was on the table when i voted 
the brady amendment was gone 
it was not the first time the 3millionmember nra won a gun 
control fight though the opposition this time was more formidable 
the opponents matched the nras zeal but the gun control forces 
could not match the nras financial resources said dewey stokes 
the president of the fraternal order of police 
david conover an nra lobbyist attributed his groups victory 
to hard work good strategy and some lastminute luck 
the gun group as it has many times before mobilized its 21 
field representatives across the country and thousands of activist 
volunteers 
when the brady language appeared ready for a vote two weeks ago 
the nra count estimated only a narrow 10vote victory 
then the vote was postponed for a week 
we got lucky conover said because the postponement allowed 
thousands of nra members to receive their latest issue of either 
american hunter or american rifleman the nra magazines although 
prepared in august the publications contained an ad urging members 
to call members of congress to vote against the waiting period 
people saw in the magazine it still was not resolved 
conover said and apparently turned a steady stream of contacts 
with lawmakers into a lastminute flood 
meanwhile handgun control inc saying law enforcement 
uniformly supported the waiting period brought hundreds of 
uniformed police officers to washington as lobbyists 
but months before the nra had begun compiling names of police 
officers who backed the gun lobbys positions and opposed the 
waiting period 
two weeks ago the nra brought its police backers to washington 
and house members began receiving visits by rankandfile officers 
from both sides 
the probrady police officers were given space in a house office 
building by the judiciary committee whose chairman peter w 
rodino jr dnj supported their cause they turned the hearing 
room into a command center directing the lobbying effort 
the pronra police had breakfast each morning at the nra 
cafeteria and then were bused to capitol hill 
when more than 100 rankandfile police officers came to 
capitol hill and in their own words argued against a waiting 
period that had a big effect conover said 
it showed what we had been saying but had not demonstrated 
that law enforcement was not united on this issue

hurricane gilbert weakened to a 
tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw 
tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees 
along the texasmexico border 
at least 109 people have been killed and more than 800000 left 
homeless since gilbert ripped through the caribbean with 175 mph 
wind earlier this week then crossed the yucatan peninsula and gulf 
of mexico before slamming into northeastern mexico one person died 
today in texas after being injured in a tornado 
but by this morning the once massive storms maximum sustained 
winds had flagged to 65 mph nine less than hurricane strength and 
forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared however they 
warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland 
gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 am edt as it 
proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of monterrey in northern 
mexico said noel rishnychok a meteorologist with the national 
hurricane center in coral gables fla 
winds were still weakening as the storm moved westnorthwest at 
12 mph he said 
gulf coast residents expressed relief that the storm which 
earlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the western 
hemisphere pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering a 
spate of tornadoes 
were thankful said betty turner mayor of corpus christi 
what could have been one of the most deadly storms in history 
appears to have missed us 
corpus christi residents who evacuated were eager to return but 
turner said were saying dont do it because of the flooding 
at least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern texas today 
following 14 on friday killing one woman striking a hospital 
complex military bases and a mobile home park authorities said 
some injuries were reported 
at 6 am cdt the center of the storm was in northern mexico 
near latitude 250 degrees north and longitude 998 west or about 
150 miles southwest of brownsville located at the southernmost tip 
of texas 
gilberts remnants should bring very heavy rains to rio grande 
valley before heading north up the mississippi river valley as a 
huge rainmaking machine said mark zimmer meteorologist at 
the national hurricane center in coral gables fla 
the danger of flash flooding in texas is very great zimmer 
said rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches maybe even 20 inches 
is expected 
by midweek the storm should be in the lower ohio river valley 
and end up in the great lakes as nothing more than foul weather 
forecasters said 
the people in the midwest better dust off their umbrellas 
zimmer said 
gilbert responsible for billions of dollars in damage during a 
weeklong rampage across the caribbean and gulf of mexico barreled 
ashore friday afternoon in tamaulipas state a sparsely populated 
area of mexico about 120 miles south of brownsville 
the eye passed over santa rosa and santa cruz two small 
villages a few miles north of la pesca mexico where ocean tides 
coursed over two miles of flatlands and into the town 
we presume the mexican villages are getting a good pounding 
from 120 mph winds zimmer said friday 
thousands of people evacuated in areas of northeastern mexico 
including the entire beach area of matamoros a city of 280000 
just across the border 
to the south about 300000 people were homeless in yucatan 
state and 10000 more were homeless in campeche on the west coast 
of the peninsula the government news agency notimex said the 
storm had left more than 500000 homeless in jamaica earlier in the 
week 
in texas heavy rains fell on brownsville with gusts up to 82 
mph recorded at nearby padre island but the vulnerable coastal 
area escaped the worst of the storm 
police in nearby harlingen said the windows of 20 to 30 cars in 
a parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado lowlying 
coastal roads were closed by high water 
about 125 shelters holding 50000 people were open in a 
fourcounty area of southern texas around brownsville said 
american red cross spokeswoman barbara lohman when the eye of the 
storm passed to the south evacuees were eager to return to their 
homes 
were going home we think everything is going to be ok 
philip gibbons said friday night leaving a brownsville shelter 
into a downpour we dont think its going to get bad and there 
was no need to stay here anymore 
others however were more cautious 
i wouldnt want to go home and then have my family hurt by a 
tornado said praxedis lindsey 25 of brownsville who was at a 
shelter with his pregnant wife and son 
elsewhere most of the estimated 25000 people evacuated in 
southern louisiana and 20000 in the island city of galveston were 
allowed to return home friday 
in alabama tornadoes were reported in seven counties uprooting 
trees but causing no major damage or injuries 
one texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane a 
3yearold boy fell from his familys shrimp boat when they moved 
the vessel for safe mooring officials said

winds crossed onto land at 535 pm edt sweeping ashore in a 
sparsely populated area 120 miles south of brownsville texas

and mudslides after it barreled into mexico earlier in the week 
gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300000 people homeless in the 
yucatan peninsula 
the hurricane has killed at least 109 people including one in 
texas 39 in mexico 26 in jamaica 30 in haiti five in the 
dominican republic and eight in honduras however the death toll 
is expected to rise 
in matamoros just across the rio grande from brownsville the 
storm felled trees downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin 
shack homes on the evacuated beachfront about 5000 people were 
evacuated inland 
nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around brownsville 
much of the yucatan peninsula remained without communications and 
supplies today 
at 9 am edt today gilberts center was located near latitude 
251 north and longitude 1003 west or 185 miles west southwest of 
brownsville and 40 miles south of monterrey said the national 
hurricane center in florida 
maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the 
storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours 
the center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the 
storm with up to 20 inches locally flash floods were likely it 
said 
the storm was moving westnorthwest at about 12 mph and was 
expected to follow that track through midday today before turning 
gradually to the northwest forecasters said 
in matamoros officials said the worst part of the storm 
appeared to have passed up to now the damages are not considered 
very grave said jose inez gonzalez a matamoros government

press by telephone 
there is considerable material damage to the town it is still 
raining very hard said mayor ruben hinojosa cortina we will 
just have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey the 
situation 
hinojosa cortina said about 3000 refugees from la pesca were 
sheltered in soto la marina but other coastal residents had not 
been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm 
the sierra de tamaulipas a small mountain range between 
monterrey and the coast should blunt the hurricanes strength 
said mark zimmer a meterologist at the national hurricane center 
zimmer expected the last of hurricaneforce winds today but he 
predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler 
mountain air possibly causing flash floods and mudslides 
the mexican armed forces began emergency flights friday of food 
medicines and water to cancun cozumel and other disaster sites in 
the yucatan 
in many locations hurricane victims were without food drinking 
water electrical power gasoline and communications since

ptls bankruptcy trustee says he is 
considering two new bids for the ministrys assets this weekend as 
he prepares to recommend a buyer to a federal bankruptcy judge 
i hope we can finish it up by monday trustee mc red 
benton said friday night 
in a separate development ministry officials said they were 
suspending some service programs at the troubled ministry 
including a home for unwed motherstobe to save money 
benton said one new bidder is a toronto ontario businessman 
but he refused to reveal his name another bid came from a group of 
private investors from the new york and washington areas benton 
said 
the charlotte nc observer quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the private investors offered about 200 million 50 
million in cash 
the canadian man the newspaper reported wants an option on the 
assets until dec 31 if he then bought the property he would pay 
115 million including 50 million in cash 
benton said if he could not make a recommendation on a buyer to 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds by monday he would request another 
deadline extension to accept more bids reynolds has given benton 
until sept 27 to choose a buyer or liquidate ptls assets 
peter thomas the vancouver british columbia businessman who 
had previously offered 113 million remains a possible buyer 
benton said adding i think peter thomas is still right in 
there 
ptl has been in bankruptcy proceedings since june 1987 three 
months after founder jim bakker left amid a sexandmoney scandal 
reynolds has said that if ptl and its large christian theme park 
near here arent sold by oct 1 he will order the ministry closed 
earlier this month benton described bakker as the leading 
bidder for the property but the proposed deal apparently fell 
through when bakker couldnt prove he had the financing to reclaim 
his ministry 
benton and don edwards interim president of heritage ministries 
inc said heritage ministries officials have suspended the 
operations of their home for unwed mothers adoption service and 
home for homeless or drugaddicted men 
the suspension will save the ministry 3000 a day in operating 
costs said edwards the minstry had found homes for the two girls 
still living at the unwed mothers facility and were looking for 
places to send the men

the polish leadership must share the blame with 
strikers and protesters for many of polands problems the 
staterun soviet press said in a rare critique of a moscow ally 
the daily newspapers izvestia and sovietskaya rossiya suggested 
in commentaries friday that polish workers were driven to strike by 
the governments mishandling of sharp price increases in the spring 
trust in polands government has eroded so badly that the 
leadership may not survive sovietskaya rossiya said 
will the incumbent government stay in power or will it resign 
this issue has become a political reality and will be discussed by 
the polish parliament wrote v runov warsaw correspondent for 
the official tass news agency his dispatch appeared in sovietskaya 
rossiya 
izvestia said recent unrest should not cause the polish 
government to back away from reforms 
the country has approached a point in the process of socialist 
renovation and democratic development where it shouldnt stop 
further steps forward are necessary to overcome dogmatic and 
sketchy thinking said correspondent l toporkov one should 
compromise each to the other 
sovietskaya rossiya said the strikes and their aftermath are 
just another step in democratization 
but at the same time economic decline is occurring progress 
in reform over the last two or three years has been small and the 
workers themselves have failed at reform the newspaper said 
when protests swept poland earlier this year the soviet media 
called the strikes groundless and harmful both from the political 
and economic viewpoints commentaries carried by the papers then 
also accused western countries of agitating strikers 
the latest wave of strikes in august posed the most serious 
threat to polands government since it imposed martial law and 
banned solidarity in 1981 lech walesa leader of the independent 
union federation agreed to end the strikes after the government 
agreed to talks on legalizing the movement 
on aug 20 when the strike wave reached its culmination 
point it was clearly determined that the workers protest in major 
cases is resistance to the failed economic policy conducted 
recently sovietskaya rossiya said 
the polish government this year raised prices 42 percent a move 
officials said was necessary to balance goods with the money 
supply thousands of workers struck in protest and another wave of 
strikes began in august 
sovietskaya rossiya said polands council of ministers was given 
extraordinary power to push through economic reforms but it 
hasnt given any tangible results 
runov said the government has responded with immediate measures 
to speed the countrys economic reform program but a problem of 
trust in the government is still an open one

a worldrenowned heart and lung transplant 
surgeon has been ousted from his position as head of the division 
of cardiovascular surgery at the university of minnesota hospital 
dr stuart jamieson was relieved temporarily in early august 
during an investigation into assorted allegations among them a 
neverproven claim that he or one of his assistants left a forceps 
inside a patients chest and then did not inform the patient of the 
fact 
in a brief news release offering no explanations the hospital 
said friday that after considerable thought and external 
consultation a decision has now been made not to reinstate dr 
jamieson to his leadership post it said he continues as a 
professor of surgery and a member of the hospital staff 
the august announcement came after the star tribune reported 
that the university was investigating jamieson in connection with 
two operations the newspaper later said its account of one of the 
operations should not have been published because it was based on 
sources who lacked firsthand knowledge 
the st paul pioneer press dispatch last month quoted sources as 
saying the move for jamieson 40 to temporarily step aside was 
partly the result of a sharp dispute over the surgeons personality 
and aggressive management style 
the announcement friday of surgery department chairman dr john 
najarians decision not to reinstate jamieson capped weeks of 
tension at the hospital over the matter 
hospital spokeswoman sally howard said that because the decision 
involves confidential personnel matters the reasons for jamiesons 
ouster probably will never be discussed in a public forum 
there was no comment from jamieson and najarian both have 
failed to return repeated phone calls from reporters since the aug 
2 announcement 
jamieson was hired by najarian in january 1986 from stanford 
university medical center in palo alto calif where he was a 
protege of famed heart surgeon and university of minnesota alumni 
dr norman shumway shumways daughter a newly trained heart 
surgeon recently joined jamiesons staff 
i thought he was the best cardiac surgeon available in the 
united states he was our no 1 choice najarian said in may 
1986 soon after jamiesons arrival 
at the time jamieson was presidentelect of the international 
society for heart transplantation he is among a handful of 
surgeons in the world trained in combined heartlung transplants 
and has performed seven heartlung transplants at minnesota 
there are two other heart transplant surgeons among the five 
cardiac surgeons on the university staff but jamieson is the most 
experienced and the only one who has done heartlung and singleand 
doublelung transplants 
dr edward humphrey chief of heart surgery at the veterans 
administration medical center at fort snelling will serve as 
interim head of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery until a 
permanent head is appointed the statement said

british boxer frank bruno the no 1 contender to 
mike tysons heavyweight crown shielded his family with his body 
while the 200 mph winds of hurricane gilbert pounded jamaica a 
newspaper reported saturday 
nothing had been heard from the 26yearold boxer on vacation 
in jamaica with his girlfriend laura and their daughters nicola 
6 and rachel 2 since the hurricane struck the island last monday 
but on saturday the london daily mail newspaper which tracked 
them to their hotel at the beachside resort of negril told how 
bruno had shielded his family with his 228pound body while the 
storm battered the holiday complex 
it was worse than anything you can imagine the mail quoted 
bruno as saying there was nothing to do but duck down box 
clever and pray and hope it would go away 
nothing can scare me now tyson will be a breeze after this 
little lot the boxer whose title fight with the american has 
been postponed twice was quoted as saying 
bruno would not have been on vacation at all had his title fight 
with tyson originally scheduled for wembley stadium oct 8 not 
been delayed the champion suffered a concussion in a car crash at 
his new york state home two weeks ago and no new date has been 
fixed 
the daily mail said other guests at brunos hotel talked with 
admiration of the fighters efforts to protect his family and help 
local villagers replace tin roofs on their shattered homes 
they quoted west german engineer frank oesterle vacationing at 
the same hotel as bruno as saying he is a big man in every way 
with a big heart he worked like a trojan to help clear up the mess 
and he was out among the guests cheering them up 
he told me that during the height of the storm his family was 
very frightened crouching on the floor and he used his big arms 
and body to protect them oesterle told the daily mail 
bruno told the newspaper quite frankly we were all shocked 
we did not think it was going to be as serious as it was even 
though we had a warning 
in london brunos manager terry lawless who spent four days 
trying to contact the fighter said thank god hes safe i am 
not surprised hes being dubbed a hero

national resistance killed 46 soldiers from mozambique and zimbabwe 
during clashes in the last month the rebels claimed saturday 
the rebels released the statement in lisbon one day after pope 
john paul ii arrived in mozambique on the last part of a 10day 
tour of southern africa john paul urged mozambiques 
marxistoriented leaders to begin peace talks with the rebels 
in the statement rebel movement leader alfonso dhlakama said he 
hoped john pauls visit would contribute to peace in mozambique 
one of the worlds poorest nations and one that has been wracked by 
internal war since it gained independence from portugal in 1975 
on monday the rebels declared a ceasefire in three areas of 
the country so residents could attend masses celebrated by the pope 
the rebel statement said its forces on sept 1 attacked barracks 
housing mozambique government troops and zimbabwean forces killing 
nine mozambican and seven zimbabwean soldiers

government soldiers and nine zimbabweans in clashes near vila de

neighboring countries and caused famine among an estimated 6 
million of the countrys 145 million inhabitants

fighters formerly received backing from south africa have been

japan operated a secret chemical weapons factory 
during world war ii bombed china with poison gas grenades and 
tested poison on prisoners of war including americans a new 
report charges 
the report in the october issue of the chicagobased bulletin of 
the atomic scientists also contends the us government knew about 
japans use of chemical weapons but failed to prosecute japanese 
officers at the tokyo war crimes tribunal in 1946 
the reports author yuki tanaka speculated the us government 
decided against prosecuting because it wanted to learn from japans 
knowledge of bacteriological warfare 
the use of chemical weapons by the japanese was covered up 
by the us government tanaka said saturday in a telephone 
interview from his home in australia 
tanaka a lecturer in japanese at the university of adelaide in 
australia drew on newly discovered japanese war documents his own 
interviews and previously published material to piece together the 
account said len ackland the bulletins editor 
i think what you have here is the first full story of japans 
poison gas enterprise and its grim results both on the chinese and 
on the japanese workers he said friday 
tanaka said his research was prompted partly by the japanese 
governments longtime insistence that it never used chemical 
weapons in world war ii japan signed the 1925 geneva convention 
that banned use of such weapons 
tanaka said his research showed that japan built a factory for 
chemical weapons on okunoshima one of dozens of tiny islands in 
the inland sea to help keep the factory secret tanaka contends 
the japanese government erased the island from maps in 1939 
the factory operated from 1929 until the end of world war ii 
when it was destroyed at the direction of allied officers the 
plant manufactured a variety of chemicals including mustard gas 
lewisite nausea gas and hydrocyanic acid gas for use against 
china tanakas report said 
neither the japanese nor us governments would respond to the 
report in the bulletin a monthly magazine founded in 1945 and 
supported by scientists concerned about the implications of nuclear 
weapons development 
the japanese foreign ministry would not make an official comment 
despite repeated calls from the associated press but a ministry of 
education official said we have not gathered enough evidence to 
specify it as a historical event 
the us defense and state departments also declined comment on 
the report through several public affairs officers all of whom 
refused to be identified 
atrocities committed during the japanese invasion of china 
which began shortly before world war ii have long been a source of 
controversy between the two countries chinese army records allege 
that at least 2000 chinese were killed and 35000 injured by 
japanese chemical weapons tanakas report said 
tanaka wrote that in 1983 researchers from keio university 
obtained a twovolume report on japans experiments with 
bacteriological and chemical weapons on chinese soviet american 
and polish prisoners in the early 1940s 
the article gave no detail on the tests on americans but said 
chinese were subjected to mustard gas attacks and it quoted 
research notes on the resulting damage to their skin 
in another test chinese prisoners had to drink a liquid form of 
the chemical in a third some of the liquid was dropped in the eye 
of a prisoner tanaka reported documents do not say what happened 
to the prisoners 
in his article tanaka contends that us col thomas morrow a 
law officer assigned to investigate japanese war crimes uncovered 
evidence of japans use of chemical weapons and wrote two reports 
about it 
but tanaka said morrow was summoned home abruptly from tokyo 
in the early stages of the war crimes trials and the issue was 
dropped possibly because the us government was interested in 
keeping information relating to biological and chemical warfare for 
its own use 
my intention was to warn of the danger of chemical weapons 
tanaka said so i hope the us and other major countries which 
are producing chemical weapons will reconsider 
the report also said medical specialists from hiroshima 
university have tracked nearly 5800 former employees of the 
chemical weapons factory who suffered lasting injuries from working 
with the substances 
cancer of the respiratory organs is particularly high 
suggesting a direct link with the inhalation of poison gas the 
report said 
one worker recalled in an interview that the factory was so 
contaminated that workers had to keep an eye on caged parakeets 
which dropped dead when gas leakage rose the report said

lloyd bentsen finishing a fourday southern campaign swing 
declared saturday that democrats who voted for president reagan in 
1980 and 1984 are coming back in droves 
the texas senator told an enthusiastic partisan audience in a 
small college auditorium that his ticket represented the 
difference between performance and promise its a message we 
understand here in the south 
ive spent a lot of time in the last month going around 
visiting democrats that have voted for reagan he said and 
ive gone to them and said come home and theyre coming back 
in droves 
vice president george bush had failed in his role as reagans 
appointee to lead the fight against drug imports in florida 
bentsen said 
and now george bush wants a promotion he said drawing 
laughter from the crowd and he wants to pass the torch of 
failure on to the junior senator from indiana republican vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle 
bentsen spoke in front of a huge american flag behind a 
collection of nautical items including a ships wheel and lobster 
traps 
on the stage with him was sen lawton chiles dfla with whom 
bentsen has gone quail hunting in the past were opening quayle 
season a little early this year bentsen said repeating one of 
his favorite lines 
in this conservative area of the florida panhandle near two 
major military installations bentsen tried to underline what he 
said was a commitment to a strong defense by democratic nominee 
michael dukakis 
our message to the new south our message to america is 
strength and stability for national defense he said 
we support a strong nuclear deterrent we support the triad 
powerful reliable strategic weapons on the land in the air and 
under the sea he said 
he did not mention dukakis opposition to two programs for 
modernizing the landbased leg of the triad the mx and midgetman 
missiles bentsen himself has supported both of those programs 
chiles described bentsen as the third senator from florida 
for all the work hes done for the state 
but even enthusiastic supporters in the audience doubted the 
panhandle would go for the ticket 
youre in the middle of the redneck riviera said kay 
horton who was the areas lone dukakis delegate to the democratic 
national convention 
jerry miller democratic chairman of nearby okaloosa county 
said reagan took the area 65 percent to 35 percent last time

armed buddhist monks and students took 
over a government building saturday forcing 24 soldiers to 
surrender in the latest escalation of unrest threatening to topple 
the authoritarian government 
the occupation of the ministry of trade building in downtown 
rangoon was believed to be the first in which a government office 
in the capital was taken over by protesters fighting to end 26 
years of repression under the burma socialist program party 
the soldiers first opened fire on the protesters and slightly 
wounded three people they later surrendered and were disguised as 
protesters with red headbands and allowed to escape witnesses 
said mobs outside the building had threatened to behead the guards 
the shooting was believed to be the first time soldiers fired on 
demonstrators since the aug 812 rioting that ousted hardline 
president sein lwin and left 112 people dead by the governments 
count they previously shot only at escaping prisoners and mobs of 
looters 
elsewhere three people accused of offering poisoned water to 
protesters two weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and beheaded 
after the monks released them from custody witnesses said 
up to 500000 demonstrators including striking government 
workers and policemen took part in peaceful marches in rangoon 
carying placards that said if we dont get it democracy we 
will hit out 
westerneducated lawyer maung maung took over aug 19 as the 
first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup but protesters 
have rejected his plan for the ruling party to supervise a general 
election under a multiparty system they have demanded an interim 
government be formed to conduct the polling 
witnesses said the troops guarding the ministry building opened 
fire after a surging group of protesters surrounded the building 
and threatened to set it ablaze 
clambering over adjacent rooftops students entered the top 
floor of the fourstory structure twentyfour soldiers inside 
surrendered to monks who drove them away after seizing a 
submachine gun and several semiautomatic weapons 
protesters also ringed the city hall and central bank buildings 
nearby and shots were heard but there apparently was no bloodshed 
after reinforcements arrived about 100 soldiers were posted at 
both buildings 
security forces have sided with protesters in towns including 
victoria point in the southernmost province of mergui on sept 9 
500 servicemen joined protest marches in rangoon in the first major 
military defections 
staterun radio rangoon saturday urged army personnel to return 
to their duties and work toward consolidating sovereignty 
national unity 
opposition leaders who were believed to be negotiating with the 
government on formation of an interim administration have tried to 
prevent violence 
on friday leading dissident aung gyi defused a potentially 
bloody confrontation between soldiers and 100000 demonstrators 
moving on the heavily guarded ministry of defense compound with 
spears swords and knives 
aung gyi a former army brigadier told the crowd we cannot 
blame these soldiers for the faults of some of their commanders 
street protests have persisted despite a series of concessions 
by maung maungs government 
the latest announced by radio rangoon friday said all military 
personnel and civil servants must resign from the ruling party and 
not become members of any future political parties 
it said the decision was made at the recommendation of the 
commission that is to supervise the elections which may occur in 
october twothirds of the 25 million party members come from 
military and civil service ranks 
many government workers said saturday they would not heed a 
government warning to return to work by sept 26 or face 
punishment virtually all the workers have been on strike since 
aug 8 paralyzing the adminstration 
one effect of the strikes has been the price of rice the staple 
food has tripled in recent weeks the us embassy said saturday 
it would donate 500000 to religious organizations to buy rice for 
needy residents 
with the political instability most embassies have evacuated 
dependents of their diplomatic staffs and nonessential personnel 
a number of japanese were evacuated saturday to thailand after 
the embassy in rangoon urged the remaining 108 japanese there to 
leave about 100 americans had left earlier 
security forces killed scores of people in quelling studentled 
protests in march and june that set the stage for the july 23 
resignation of ne win who had ruled since he staged the 1962 coup 
more protests flared after sein lwin succeeded him the 
government said security forces killed 112 people in rangoon before 
sein lwin resigned aug 12 after 17 days in power but western 
diplomats said the death toll may have been much higher

george bush has been noncombatant as the 
reagan administrations point man in the war on drugs and the grim 
toll has climbed with more deaths more wasted lives more 
shattered families a texas democrat said saturday 
while george bush was in charge he himself said the nation is 
losing ground in the war on drugs thats because hes used only 
one weapon in the war hot air rep ron coleman said in the 
democratic response to president reagans weekly radio address 
coleman accused the vice president of supporting funding cuts to 
enforcement and drug treatment programs slashing personnel and 
leading an ineffective border interdiction system that even the 
head of the drug enforcement administration recommended be 
abolished 
coleman pointed to a survey of drug enforcement officials by the 
watchdog general accounting office that showed more than half 
believing that bushs antidrug programs had no effect or had 
somewhat worsened drug interdiction efforts 
he also took aim at a proposal by the republican presidential 
nominee to put his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana in 
charge of the drug fight if the two are elected 
this is the fellow who until last week wasnt even aware his 
boss had been directing the administrations antidrug efforts 
coleman said of quayle 
the medellin cartel colombian drug dealers isnt exactly 
worried at the thought that j danforth quayle might take aim at 
their deadly business with his press releases coleman said 
referring to quayles work as a public relations officer for the 
indiana national guard during the vietnam war 
how can he be put in charge of this war when he wouldnt fight 
in the last one we still havent forgotten the last time he was 
given the opportunity to carry a rifle for his country coleman 
said this is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press 
releases in indiana

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address 
hello im congressman ron coleman from texas 
those of us along the usmexico border live on the front lines 
of the war on drugs you can walk into the desert from my home in 
el paso any night and hear the drone of aircraft flying north with 
their deadly cardo 
the reaganbush administrations point man in the war on drugs 
is the man who would be president george bush 
but the stubborn facts are these 
while george bush was in charge he himself said the nation is 
losing ground in the war on drugs thats because hes used only 
one weapon in the war hot air 
while george bush was in charge he tried to cut 238 million 
from drug enforcement funding for state and local police 
departments 
while george bush was in charge he tried to cut drug treatment 
funding by 50 percent 
while george bush was in charge not once did mr bush demand 
economic sanctions under a law he said he wanted against 
countries that wont cooperate in the war on drugs 
while george bush was in charge 2000 coast guard personnel 
have been cut from the war on drugs 
while george bush was in charge the reaganbush administration 
created the toughsounding national narcotics border interdiction 
system but it worked so badly that the head of the drug 
enforcement administration said it should be abolished 
while george bush was in charge the reaganbush administration 
tried to kill the program that helps state and local governments 
pursue drug traffickers 
while george bush was in charge panamas drugsmuggling 
dictator general noriega was on the us government payroll 
lining his pockets and returning the favor by lining our morgues 
with the bodies of our young people 
while george bush was in charge the cost of cocaine in miami 
plummeted 600 percent 
while george bush was in charge cocaine deaths doubled 
nationwide 
while george bush was in charge the grim drug toll has climbed 
more deaths more wasted lives more shattered families 
the verdict of drug enforcement officials nationwide in a survey 
by the watchdog general accounting office more than half said 
george bushs antidrug program had no effect or had somewhat 
worsened drug interdiction efforts 
and whats george bushs latest proposal putting vice 
presidential hopeful j danforth quayle in charge youll remember 
this is the fellow who until last week wasnt even aware his boss 
had been directing the administrations antidrug efforts 
imagine j danforth quayle in charge of the war on drugs how 
can he be put in charge of this war when he wouldnt fight in the 
last one we still havent forgotten the last time he was given the 
opportunity to carry a rifle for his country 
this is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press releases 
in indiana this is a fellow who voted to drop drug charges against 
panamas indicted dictator 
putting the vice president in charge of the war on drugs isnt a 
new idea president reagan tried it it didnt work then and it 
certainly wont work now under the country club direction of golfer 
j danforth quayle 
the stubborn fact is the george herbert walker bush and j 
danforth quayle have been noncombatants in the war on drugs the 
medellin cartel isnt exactly worried at the thought that j 
danforth quayle might take aim at their deadly business with his 
press releases 
several days ago the nation was shocked by the story of a 
little boy in new orleans named shrimpy shrimpy worked for two 
years for drug dealers and lost a bag of crack he got a bullet in 
his head from pointblank range shrimpy was 11 years old 
the problem isnt just saying no to drugs its getting a new 
president and vice president who will say yes to fighting the war 
this is congressman ron coleman from texas for a drugfree 
america thank you and have a good weekend

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address delivered from camp david md 
my fellow americans let me begin this talk with a special 
message to the people of texas 
last night many of you endured the ravages of hurricane 
gilbert today as you wait for the waters to recede and the 
cleanup to begin nancy and i and all americans hold you in our 
prayers 
we all have one blessing to count warning came early you were 
ready so were we the federal government has spent the last week 
preparing to help during and after the storm 
weve offered help as well to our international friends who felt 
gilberts full force as i told jamaican prime minister edward 
seaga were ready to play an active role in helping them to 
rebuild 
now on a happier note if youre like me you look forward 
every four years to a very special event the summer olympics as 
you know this week and next the olympics are being held in seoul 
south korea 
last night athletes from all over the world marched around the 
olympic stadium there and stood and watched as a single 
torchbearer climbed the steps and lit the olympic flame marking 
the start of the games 
im sure that like me youll be proud of all these young men 
and women and particularly of our own american athletes our 
athletes are a remarkable group not only for their achievements 
but for how they represent so much of what is good and beautiful 
and splendid about this sweet and promised land 
as vice president bush said when representing all of us he saw 
them off two weeks ago they stand for the country of the little 
guy the country where no matter what the circumstances of your 
birth or background you can go anywhere and do anything where the 
millionaire has no more vote than the pauper where the sense of 
possibilities is so palpable you can almost breathe it in the air 
the vice president was right and ive always thought you could 
see the spirit of which he spoke in all our olympic athletes you 
can see it in the way so many of them will pause in their daily 
training in seoul as our athletes have at past olympics to help 
competitors from countries where good coaching is hard if not 
impossible to find you can see it in stories that have been told 
about american olympians over the years like the one about a 
boyhood hero of mine jim thorpe 
in the 1912 olympics in stockholm thorpe took the gold in both 
the pentathlon and the decathlon he was the most talked about 
competitor at those games with his medals won thorpe was 
presented to the king of sweden who said you sir are the 
worlds greatest athlete and what was thorpes reply to this 
august european monarch it was simple straightforward and 
american he said thanks king 
and you can see the american spirit in the lives of every one of 
our team members at these games this team comes from all over our 
nation from the roughandtumble streets of our brawny cities to 
the quiet lanes of our vast countryside from the suburban hills of 
southern california to riverfront towns n the midwest they 
represent every aspect of our countrys life and a shining hope 
too a crystalline beacon of opportunity that we know is the heart 
of america 
one athlete raised in very modest circumstances recalled 
recently that quote we were rich as a family unquote and 
that wealth of love has given her the strength to achieve her 
dream just as throughout our history the wealth of family love has 
given countless millions of americans the strength to pursue their 
dreams in our land of opportunity 
theres so much we have to be proud of in our olympic team this 
year in all teams from all over the world no group of young men 
and women is quite like them theyre filled with optimism for the 
future with faith in the boundless possibilities of humanity with 
zest for a life pursuing excellence pursuing achievement pursuing 
the limits of their godgiven abilities and piercing beyond what 
they thought were those limits 
as an olympic athlete from another nation recently marveled 
about our nation and its people he said in america they 
appreciate achievement and faith in the future in fact he said 
its a prerequisite for getting around and he concluded 
contrasting the energy of the united states to other countries he 
had known for everybody in the street in america every day is a 
competition 
yes our athletes have a love a happiness and an exuberance in 
being american theyre as patriotic as the pledge of allegiance 
as red white and blue as the flag they are filled with the 
spirit of our land and all of its magnificent diversity a 
diversity you can see even in their faces 
when you look at most other teams its easy to tell what 
continent or region theyre from but we americans come from every 
continent and region ours are the faces of all humanity just as 
our nation was built by the hopes of all humanity 
so as you watch these olympics remember win lose or draw 
how much we have to be proud and thankful for after all were 
americans 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

israeli forces and allied lebanese 
militiamen withdrew to the israelioccupied security zone saturday 
after a 24hour search operation for guerrillas in southern 
lebanon police said 
about 250 israeli troops and militiamen of the south lebanon 
army in 29 tanks and armored vehicles pulled back to the security 
zone before dawn after searching a 24squaremile area for 
guerrillas 
a police spokesman said the israelis and their allies did not 
face any resistance during the operation which was carried out 
just south of syrian army lines in the western sector of lebanons 
bekaa valley 
five lebanese citizens were wounded during the sweep and shells 
severely damaged at least 15 houses in the villages of mimess and 
ain ata the spokesman said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity did not say how the five were injured 
the search was launched friday hours after an israeli army 
patrol foiled an infiltration attempt inside the security zone 
killing three guerrillas 
talaat yacoubs prosyrian palestine liberation front claimed 
responsibility for the attack in a communique released in the 
southern port city of sidon 
the attempted infiltration friday was the second abortive 
attempt in six days to cross the sixto10mile security zone 
established by israel 
a week ago israeli soldiers captured four guerrillas after 
seriously wounding one of them in the zone 
israel set up its security zone after withdrawing the bulk of 
its occupation army from southern lebanon in june 1985 after a 
threeyear occupation the zone is intended to serve as a buffer 
against crossborder raids 
the strip is patrolled by about 1000 israeli troops and an 
equal number of militiamen 
also saturday gunmen wounded three ghanaian peacekeepers 
serving with the un interim force in lebanon in the southern town 
of abbasiyeh a un spokesman said 
the un spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the gunmen chased the un jeep and opened fire after it had an 
accident with a civilian car 
the attackers escaped and civilians evacuated the three 
wounded ghanaian soldiers to a hospital in the southern port city 
of tyre the spokesman said 
he said the three ghanians were admitted to unifils field 
hospital at the border town of naqoura their condition was 
satisfactory he said 
the 5800strong unifil with soldiers from nine countries has 
been based in southern lebanon since march 1978

officials predicted disaster and 
talked of fingerprinting those who stayed behind to identify their 
bodies gulf coast residents from grand isle la to this 
tipoftexas town boarded up their windows and fled 
but in the end it was gilbert the storm of the century 
who stayed away turning out to be too big to turn north too 
gracious to blast the us coast 
we were waiting for the storm but it never showed up said 
francisco garcia as he used a crowbar to pry plywood off his 
familys barbecue hut some people are mad a little bit that they 
spent money and the hurricane never showed up 
meteorologists predictions that gilbert like past hurricanes 
would turn north toward texas or louisiana and strengthen after 
battering mexicos yucatan penninsula proved wrong gilbert hardly 
strayed from its westnorthwest course 
he was so large it was too hard to veer said greg flatt of 
the national weather service here it was controlling the weather 
pattern the weather pattern wasnt controlling it 
said neil frank former director of the national hurricane 
center and now weatherman for khou in houston this storm was so 
big it just did its own thing and charged right into mexico 
gilbert dumped up to 6 inches of rain on areas and spun off 
deadly tornadoes that destroyed a few homes damaged roofs and 
shattered windows across the rio grande in mexico as in jamaica 
and haiti the damage was widespread and severe 
i dont think anybodys going to feel this was the wrong thing 
to do corpus christi mayor betty turner said of the evacuation 
in her town where thousands of residents crowded into shelters 
this isnt new to south texas said corpus christi police 
chief robert olson people know what hurricanes can do i think 
that should another one arise theyll respond just as well 
on galveston island near houston several hundred miles from 
where gilbert hit an evacuation order was under fire and some in 
poor neighborhoods of this border town complained about the expense 
of hurricane preparations 
but when the sky cleared most said they held no hard feelings 
over the noshow hurricane 
id rather be safe than sorry said rosbel villarreal who 
boarded up the home he recently bought here and took his family 
including three young children to a motel in mcallen i spent 
probably 150 but i didnt want to take a chance 
sometimes they hit here sometimes they dont you never 
know said jeni hinojosa as she swept up fallen leaves and 
branches from her yard 
guadalupe longoria remembers more brutal storms here like allen 
and beulah but she stayed in her home alone praying all friday 
night 
i was expecting whatever the dear lord sends us she said 
by saturday morning a steady stream of cars and campers 
returned to windwhipped brownsville and the city that had gone 
into hibernation returned to life lines formed at bakeries and 
crews began picking up the fallen palms and branches 
for five days reports on gilberts brute force prompted coastal 
residents to batten down the hatches and prepare for a fierce storm 
that made its mark on history with the lowest recorded barometric 
pressure in the hemisphere 
thousands of residents evacuated but most stayed saying either 
they felt safe in their own homes and would tough it out or they 
feared looters 
plywood shot up to 15 a sheet in some areas there were long 
lines at grocery stores and hotels hundreds of miles away took in 
gilbert escapees 
youve got to do it garcia said the meteorologists made 
a mistake but anybody can make a mistake you never know with 
hurricanes

the government said solidarity has a 
future in poland but refused to lift a 6yearold ban on the east 
blocs first independent union federation a union leader reported 
saturday 
they clearly said give us time said wladyslaw frasyniuk 
describing a meeting friday between solidarity chief lech walesa 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak and 22 other people from the 
government solidarity and the church 
walesa meanwhile traveled to this southern city saturday for an 
annual workers pilgrimage and to report to other solidarity 
leaders about prospects for legalizing the union 
walesa agreed to end a wave of strikes last month after the 
government agreed to talk to solidarity about legalization the 
labor unrest posed the strongest challenge to the communist 
government since it crushed solidarity in the 1981 martial law 
crackdown the union was banned in 1982 
frasyniuk solidarity leader in in the southwestern city of 
wroclaw met with a small group of reporters early saturday 
he said kiszczak informed solidarity members friday that 
solidarity has a future but told union activists that he could not 
take a decision on legalizing it now because his hands are tied 
he said alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek told the 
meeting the police and army are resisting the push to legalize 
solidarity because they fear this symbol 
can we call this a great success i think not success will 
occur when solidarity has the right to return to legal activity 
frasyniuk said 
but he said the union cannot involve itself in interminable 
discussions because the people we represent expect concrete 
effects 
frasyniuk said solidarity decided to continue talks even without 
a firm commitment because it did not want to be seen as being the 
first to break off the process of negotiation 
after the meeting solidarity members had a feeling of 
victory he said you could see that the problem of solidarity 
was the dominant one and nobody directly attacked solidarity 
we now see that the legalization of solidarity isnt one 
single act to grant or not it is a process said zbigniew bujak 
a warsaw solidarity leader 
newspapers on saturday carried a brief government communique 
about the meeting and listed those who attended but there was no 
confirmation of frasyniuks account 
in an unusual move the politburo of the polish united workers 
communist party held a meeting saturday to review the current 
problems of the sociopolitical situation of the country the 
staterun news service pap said it gave no further details the 
politburo normally meets only on tuesdays 
the talks at a government villa outside warsaw marked the first 
time a national delegation of solidarity activists met with 
authorities and the official trade union alliance opzz which was 
set up after solidarity was banned 
although their union remains illegal solidarity members wore 
union pins during the meeting and were treated with respect by the 
officials present frasyniuk said 
but andrzej stelmachowski a prosolidarity law professor who 
served as a mediator to set up the meeting said some bitter 
things were exchanged during the six hours of talks he did not 
elaborate 
the meeting was to discuss terms for largescale talks on 
polands future including the subject of solidarity and trade 
union pluralism the sides agreed that the talks would convene in 
midoctober 
walesa left warsaw on saturday for the jasna gora monastery in 
czestochowa site of the black madonna painting polands most 
revered icon 
he was to attend a workers pilgrimage that annually draws tens 
of thousands of solidarity supporters it was begun by the 
prosolidarity priest the rev jerzy popieluszko before his murder 
by police agents in 1984 
in the soviet union meanwhile the staterun media softened 
their hardline support of the polish government they said 
officials and protesters must share the blame for many of polands 
problems and that the two should compromise 
the daily newspapers sovietskaya rossiya and izvestia carried 
commentaries friday suggesting that workers were driven to strike 
by the governments mishandling of sharp price increases in the 
spring 
sovietskaya rossiya said trust in polands government has eroded 
so badly that the leadership may not survive

marylands top law official pulled two 
saturday night special handguns from underneath his business 
suit to make a point at a breakfast for gun control advocates 
bishop l robinson the secretary of public safety and 
correctional services pulled out the guns to illustrate how easily 
they could be concealed stunning guests invited to gov william 
donald schaefers fundraising breakfast friday morning 
my god it was so dramatic said harold c donofrio an 
advertising executive bishop does not dress in loose clothing 
not a bulge anywhere 
all of a sudden he gets a gun from inside his belt and the 
next thing you know hes got this thing in the palm of his hand he 
passes that one off to someone reaches somewhere else and gets 
another gun donofrio said 
schaefer invited 40 supporters to the private breakfast to raise 
funds to back marylands handgun control bill the first of its 
kind in the nation whose fate will be decided in a referendum on 
the nov 8 ballot 
after robinsons demonstration they came up with onthespot 
pledges of an estimated 75000 to 100000 to help support the 
bill 
schaefer signed the bill which seeks to ban the sale of cheap 
handguns known as saturday night specials in may 
however a group called the maryland committee against the gun 
ban with support from the national rifle association conducted a 
vigorous campaign to repeal the law submitting enough petition 
signatures to bring the issue before state voters 
critics contend the law could lead to a ban on the sale of all 
new handguns defenders say it will only affect cheaply made 
saturday night specials 
bruce c bereano a top state lobbyist and supporter of the gun 
bill said the breakfast was a signal that from the governors 
standpoint the campaign to save the bill is going to be todus

circle k corp has dropped a plan to limit 
medicalcare coverage for employees because of lifestyle 
decisions such as those who contracted aids or suffered from 
drug or alcohol abuse 
effective immediately we have canceled implementation of 
these specific limitations due to the widespread misunderstanding 
of both the intent and the specifics of the changes circle k 
president robert reade said in a memorandum to employees 
the memorandum dated tuesday was made public friday 
in january the phoenixbased chain of convenience stores told 
its 26000 employees that rising medical costs had forced it to 
implement a policy of not paying for the medical care of people 
suffering disease or injury as a result of lifestyles the company 
does not buy health insurance instead paying medical claims out of 
its own budget 
the policy did not receive widespread attention until august 
when it triggered complaints and demonstrations critics said it 
discriminated against victims of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
company officials said the policy was intended to apply only to 
employees hired since jan 1 limiting the number affected to 
about 3000 and claimed circle k never intended to investigate 
how employees became infected with aids which is most often 
transmitted through homosexual sex or sharing of needles by 
intravenous drug abusers 
however the chain temporarily suspended the policy and gave it 
up this month 
reade said company learned from the flap that impressions and 
perceptions many times are more important than intentions its 
such a volatile and sensitive issue that i think no matter how 
carefully we explained it we would have been misconstrued 
im just delighted said kathleen barnes director of the 
arizona aids project 
the biggest danger was always that other companies were going 
to follow their lead she said now this is going to help keep 
everyone else in check 
other companies reportedly had considered similar steps in the 
face of increases of 20 percent to 30 percent a year in the cost of 
employee medical insurance and estimates by the federal government 
that by 1991 the medical bill for aids will top 10 billion a 
year the medical cost of alcoholism already is 13 billion a year

after the main force of hurricane gilbert passed through mexico 
about 100 miles to the south 
im kind of glad to be back home i didnt know what i was 
going to find my house is 80 years old and i thought it was going 
to be blown away but it wasnt said odilon gracia 75 
he said he waited out the storm at an elementary school with a 
leaking roof and wet floors i feel a little better in my house 
than at that school he said 
while the shelters emptied the city grew congested restaurants 
and food stores closed for two days opened their doors again cars 
lined up at gas stations

mopped up water that had leaked in others cut up fallen trees and 
hauled them away 
despite wind still gusting at more that 30 mph saturday work 
crews were out picking up dangling traffic lights and downed power

pneumonia and eye and skin diseases 
have broken out in bangladesh in the aftermath of floods that 
claimed at least 953 lives doctors and officials said saturday 
over 3500 medical teams working in the flooded areas are not 
fully equipped to handle these new diseases said one health 
ministry official most of them are not carrying enough medicines 
for these ailments 
the governments toll of 953 from the flooding which inundated 
about 80 percent of the country is considered low newspapers put 
the toll in excess of 2000 
the governments figures include 211 deaths from diarrhea 
caused by the disruption of pure water supplies when floodwaters 
washed away pumps and inundated wells most of the other deaths 
occurred from drownings and a lesser number from bites by 
poisonous snakes 
flooding is an annual disaster in bangladesh where the 110 
million people earn an average per capita income of 150 per year 
last year floods during the monsoon season killed at least 1500 
people 
one doctor in dhaka said an unusually large number of 
patients from floodaffected areas are suffering from eye ailments 
and skin diseases 
the daily average of such cases has increased four to 
sixfold in the last one week said the doctor abdur rahman a 
week or 10 days back the daily average of such patients was about 
10 now it is between 50 and 60 every day 
at least 51792 cases of diarrhea have been reported from 
flooded areas where victims had little or no way to boil water a 
government effort to bring water purification tablets to the 
countryside has been largely unsuccessful 
the reports of the disease outbreaks come as the levels of major 
rivers in the lowlying country begin to recede 
by next friday most of the water will recede except from the 
lowlying areas close to the rivers said one official at the 
flood control center 
the floods have inundated 53 of the countrys 64 districts but 
government efforts to get relief to an estimated 40 million people 
have been hampered by lack of communications and resources 
many outlying areas remain inaccessible by road and there is 
little dry land for the few helicopters 
but resumption last friday of rail traffic between dhaka the 
capital and chittagong the countrys main port was expected to 
boost relief work 
bangladesh one of the poorest countries in the world relies 
heavily on imports ninety percent of its imports come through 
chittagong

lebanese presidential candidate raymond 
edde said saturday he will not return home even if he wins an 
election scheduled for thursday unless israeli forces withdraw from 
south lebanon 
meanwhile us envoy richard murphy met for more than two hours 
saturday in damascus with syrian president hafez assad to try to 
help lebanon out of a political crisis threatening to reignite 
that countrys civil war 
murphy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs 
was accompanied by washingtons new ambassador to syria edward 
djerejian and david newton head of the syria jordan and lebanon 
desk at the state department 
american and syrian officials would not elaborate on the talks 
although one us source close to the delegation said murphy may 
travel to lebanon this weekend for meetings with lebanese 
officials including president amin gemayel 
the united states and syria have been trying to ensure a 
president is elected in lebanon before friday when gemayels 
sixyear term expires under the constitution he cannot seek a 
second consecutive term 
edde speaking in a telephone interview from paris where he has 
been living since 1976 after three assassination attempts in 
lebanon said the success of thursdays vote was unfortunately 
dependent on the damascus negotiations 
an attempt to convene lebanons parliament aug 18 to elect a 
president collapsed when christian deputies opposed to syrias 
candidate former president suleiman franjieh boycotted the 
session 
lebanons usaided christians oppose syrias efforts to impose 
a settlement to end the 13yearold civil war franjieh was the 
only serious contender until edde announced his candidacy last week 
edde a 75yearold maronite christian said once israel 
withdraws its troops from a socalled security zone in south 
lebanon he can ask syria to withdraw its forces 
without that lebanon is not independent with the presence of 
both the israeli and syrian armies said edde a former interior 
minister 
the governmentrun syrian press after virtually ignoring edde 
quoted him saturday as saying the presence of their army in lebanon 
was legal 
the article was interpreted as a sign edde is emerging as a 
compromise candidate in the discussions between the syrian and us 
sides 
edde confirmed he said syrian troops were in lebanon legally 
because they were invited there in 1976 by the lebanese government 
and had a peacekeeping mandate from the arab league but he said 
there would be no need for them once israel withdrew 
i am convinced there will be no more civil war if there is a 
withdrawal because i am confident in the lebanese people from both 
sides both moslem and christian he said 
edde said if israel did not withdraw he would not return to 
lebanon and would instruct parliament instead to elect another 
president

week the haiti disaster preparedness office reported saturday 
an agronomist said the storm destroyed huge tracts of crops in 
the south and predicted a faminie 
radio stations which earlier reported 10 people died when their 
boat sank during the storm broadcast the new government figures 
saturday 
it seems that 50 to 60 percent of agricultural production in 
the south has been destroyed this means that we can expect a 
famine in that region within two months jacques edouard alexis

the military government has declared a state of emergency in the 
three southern departments where there is extensive damage to 
homes and heavy losses in livestock and fruit trees 
coastal roads were flooded and power lines blown down

the us embassy announced a gift of 25000 to the haitian red 
cross for relief work 
lt gen henri namphy president of the military government 
expressed sympathy for the victims of the hurricane friday night 
the military government is conscious of its responsibilities 
and duties towards the nation and cannot be insensitive and 
indifferent to the misfortune which has befallen us namphy said 
at least one political leader questioned why haiti hadnt better 
spent money it has received in the past for hurricane protection 
measures 
after all this time that haiti has been subject to the 
possible ravages of hurricanes and millions and millions of 
dollars have fallen into the hands of its rulers with what 
structures of protection has the country been endowed gerard 
phillipeauguste asked in a statement distributed to the press 
phillipeauguste was minister of agriculture under president 
leslie manigat who was overthrown by namphy in a military coup in

hurricane gilberts waves washed away 25 
feet of coastline leaving the highway connecting the island to the 
mainland in danger if another storm hits the gulf of mexico an 
official said saturday 
now the state is really going to have to get into the scene 
because there is a threat to the highway said mayor andy 
valence who ordered the 2000 inhabitants to evacuate during the 
storm 
altogether he said the resort community lost 100 feet of land 
from hurricanes gilbert and florence now louisiana highway 1 is 
only 100 feet from shore in some places he said 
grand isles losses are only a small part of the coastal erosion 
in a state which loses more than 50 square miles of coastal 
wetlands each year but its a significant amount for an island 
about a mile wide and eight miles long facing the open gulf of 
mexico due south of new orleans 
other parts of the state apparently escaped gilberts passage 
across the gulf unscathed aside from minor damage from a tornado 
friday in slidell north of new orleans 
gov buddy roemer will join valence next week to survey the 
coastal damage to the states only populated barrier island 
valence has been trying raise money to build two stone jetties 
to stop or at least slow down the erosion 
the jetties were a major campaign platform for the new mayor 
who took office 75 days ago since then hes had to evacuate the 
island four times for hurricanes beryl florence and gilbert and a 
tropical storm 
valence said thats a record for grand isle people are very 
sensitive to weather conditions here he said at the same 
time were equally sensitive to grand isles beauty and charm 
valence and about 12 emergency workers rode out the storm on the 
island at its worst point thursday night the pounding of the surf 
created a salt mist that shorted out and exploded hundreds of power 
company transformer connectors 
valence lifted his evacuation order saturday morning but police 
dispatcher linda blanchard said many residents went home much 
earlier while gilbert was hitting mexico 
we started coming back friday afternoon she said there 
was no water on the roads then

a steady rain fell saturday as a small 
wagon train departed from red clay state historical park for 
tahlequah okla to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 
infamous trail of tears 
its fitting observed ray morris the coordinator of the 
project from what ive read the first bunch of cherokees were 
forced to leave on a day much like this one 
morris of golconda ill drove one of the six covered wagons 
that will make the 1000mile journey scheduled to end in early 
december participants hope to call attention to the federal 
governments forced removal of the cherokees from their eastern 
homelands in 1838 
i think the blackest chapter of our nations history began 
with the indian removal act of 1830 and culminated with the 
relocation of the cherokees in 1838 morris said 
the government called it a treaty but what it really amounted 
to was at gunpoint they were made 
to leave their homes and walk to oklahoma so the white settlers 
could have their land 
according to historical accounts of the trek the first group of 
cherokees numbering about 1000 departed oct 1 1838 from red 
clay their last tribal council ground in the east they were 
accompanied by federal troops and state militia in all 13 groups 
of indians made the trek 
about 4000 of the indians or more than onethird of those 
who started out from tennessee in the fall of 1838 died along the 
way morris said yet there are only two marked graves in 
hopkinsville ky along the entire route of the trail of tears 
its a page of our history thats largely been ignored 
the wagons that left red clay on saturday were pulled by four 
mule teams and two teams of horses a halfdozen riders on 
horseback also joined the first leg of the trek 
among the riders was ricky todd a farmer from woodbury tenn 
who said he first heard of the trail of tears as a little boy when 
he saw it mentioned on a plaque woodbury was one of the towns the 
indians went through 
todd is the projects tennessee coordinator 
this is an educational project and wed like for people to 
come out and walk or ride with us for a while he said in my 
town i know the schoolchildren will be coming down to see the 
wagon train and learn more about what happened on the trail of 
tears 
we want them to know that the cherokees werent savages in 
loincloths that they were a civilized people whose land was stolen 
by the white man 
morris said the wagons represent each of the six states the 
cherokees went through on their way to oklahoma 
the cherokees followed a circuitous route through tennessee 
kentucky illinois missouri arkansas and oklahoma a route that 
later would be known as the trail of tears he said were 
going to stay as close to that route as is possible 
prior to embarking morris read a letter from wilma mankiller 
the principal chief of the cherokee nation at tahlequah 
those of you who are taking part in this commemoration of the 
cherokee trail of tears cannot conceive the human misery of those 
you now honor she wrote 
the cherokee people had lived much like their rural southern 
neighbors they were a settled agricultural people with a 
democratic form of government the effect of the removal was to 
thrust the cherokee people back into the stone age 
morris an agricultural adviser said he expects the trip to 
take 76 days or about half as long as it took the cherokees to get 
to oklahoma participants are financing the trip out of their own 
pockets except for 1000 donated by the state of illinois he 
said 
i know well run into some problems along the way but they 
wont be anything compared with the sacrifices the cherokees had to 
make he said

firstterm mayor ygnacio garza never 
wanted to be in the spotlight but he has had a hectic summer 
dealing with a store roof collapse that killed 14 and coordinating 
efforts to prepare for a hurricane 
by city charter the mayors post is not very powerful but 
garza has taken control of a city where several former top 
officials were accused of wrongdoing 
garza a 35yearold certified public accountant who served as a 
city commissioner in 197983 said he stayed out of politics after 
his first venture because he didnt think it was for him 
he returned last year to help manage his native citys 
administration after it was rocked by scandal 
although the city charter gives the mayor very little power 
the leadership has to be shown regardless of what the charter 
says said garza a 6foot6 man nicknamed nacho you have 
to assume a leadership role if you are going to lead a city through 
a crisis 
on july 7 the roof of the amigo store collapsed under the 
weight of torrential rain trapping dozens and killing 14 people 
garza took control coordinating initial rescue efforts and 
later talking to officials from across the country who offered 
equipment food and medical supplies for the victims and their 
families 
garza learned that the city lacked some heavy equipment and 
communications gear but said he was pleased that numerous private 
companies offered their assistance almost immediately 
this past week while hurricane gilbert moved through the 
caribbean toward the texasmexico border area garza and other city 
officials prepared for the worst although the storm ran inland to 
the south in mexico 
the store roof collapse had one effect on the citys 
preparations for the storm 
what the roof collapse did was give us confidence in our 
rescue procedures that we could deal with a disaster as 
devastating as a hurricane garza said the roof collapse was 
more reactionary and with the hurricane we did have some lead time 
and we knew what we wanted to do

palestinians staged a general strike saturday 
to mark the sixth anniversary of a beirut refugee camp massacre 
israeli soldiers shot and killed two palestinians and wounded 27 
arab reports and hospital officials said 
the army clamped curfews on 250000 palestinians in the occupied 
gaza strip and arrested more than 100 alleged arab ringleaders in 
the occupied west bank in a nighttime raid aimed at heading off the 
disturbances 
the 15 million arabs of the occupied territories obeyed orders 
issued by underground leaders to stage a general strike marking the 
massacre of hundreds of palestinians in beiruts sabra and chatilla 
refugee camps by israelibacked christian militiamen in 1982 
in a related development egypt marked the 10th anniversary of 
the camp david peace accords by again blaming israeli 
intransigence for the usbrokered plans failure to give the 
palestinians a voice in ruling themselves 
butros ghali minister of state for foreign affairs said in 
cairo egypt had hoped that this anniversary would come at a time 
when there was peace in the middle east and palestinians enjoyed 
the right of self determination 
but because of israeli intransigence and the continuation of 
its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and its 
continuation of repressive measures which stand against all 
international laws as well as un principles the palestinian 
people still live under tragic circumstances 
the signing of the two accords which laid down a framework that 
led seven months later to the only peace treaty between israel and 
an arab country followed 13 days of negotiations at the us 
presidential retreat at camp david maryland 
egypt considers that accord frozen since negotiations among 
israel egypt and the united states broke down in 1982 
ghalis statement noted the uprising that began in the occupied 
west bank and gaza last dec 8 he said the palestinians have 
refused and rebelled against iraeli occupation in a huge popular 
uprising 
palestinians saturday stayed away from their jobs and kept 
indoors except for knots of mostly young protesters who took to the 
streets to burn tires and stone israeli forces 
late friday the army bracing for trouble arrested over 100 
palestinians suspected of organizing demonstrations in nablus 
dahariya and tulkarm in the occupied west bank a military 
spokesman said 
but the move did not prevent the most widespread and intense 
violence in several weeks 
in jenin israeli soldiers opened fire after dozens of 
palestinian protesters blocked a main road with burning tires and 
stones and threw rocks at military vehicles arab reporters said 
the troops killed 18yearold emad arkawi palestinian hospital 
officials said 
arab reporters said israeli troops also shot and killed 
25yearold munjed sarhan from the village of lubban sharqiya 
sarhan died immediately his body was draped in a palestinian flag 
and buried the reporters said 
a military spokesman confirmed a dead palestinian was brought to 
jenin hospital but said members of the family took the corpse for 
burial and the army could not investigate the cause of death the 
spokesman said he was investigating the reported death in lubban 
sharqiya 
saturdays fatalities brought the palestinian death toll to 268 
since the intefadeh arabic for uprising broke out nine months 
ago six israelis also have died 
of the 27 palestinian casualties reported saturday the army 
confirmed only the wounding of one boy in gaza 
in jenin insurgents scrawled graffiti in arabic and hebrew that 
said death to the jews and the end is near it was the 
first time protesters have painted graffiti in hebrew

a highway construction site turned into a 
fish grab when part of a bayou was drained leaving a wide muddy 
hole where men with nets buckets and spears sloshed around after 
fish 
but not for long state wildlife and fisheries agents armed with 
ticket books quickly put the brakes on the landlubber fishermen 
friday 
the people who got citations were the ones in the water 
actively chasing the fish said capt burton wiley of the 
wildlife department we didnt write up anyone who was picking up 
dead fish off the bank if they want to scavenge thats their 
business 
agents ticketed only people who caught gamefish such as bass or 
perch from the water letting them keep trash fish such as catfish 
gar and buffalo fish he said 
but men at the construction scene after the incident disputed 
wiley saying the game wardens confiscated all of the fish 
including catfish and buffalo fish and they said nobody was 
allowed to pick up any of the fish at the site 
i dont think it is right for us to have to pay a big fine for 
catching fish that were going to die anyway the alexandria daily 
town talk quoted an unidentified participant as saying the minimum 
penalty for violating state gamefish regulations is 25 
wiley said the best thing for the contractor to have done with 
unharmed fish stranded in the pool have been to dump them into the 
bayou on the other side of the earthen dam 
project engineer raymond boniol of the state department of 
transportation and development said he was not present when the 
tickets were issued and is not familiar with state laws governing 
taking fish at a construciton site 
thats not in the plans and specifications we drew up for this 
project he joked

william l mitchell creator of 
the nowclassic corvette stingray and a former general motors 
executive has died of heart failure at the age of 76 
ranked as one of the top 10 auto designers of all time by car 
and driver magazine mitchell was a winter resident of north palm 
beach fla he died monday in michigan and was buried friday in 
bloomfield hills 
a vice president of design at gm for 19 years mitchell molded 
the appearance of hundreds of car models including the 1963 buick 
riviera and the 1970 camaro his designs were transformed into more 
than 725 million automobiles according to gm 
the stingray was introduced in 1963 when the corvette was about 
10 years old and quickly became the dream of sportscar lovers 
mitchell told the post of west palm beach fla last year of 
the genesis of his idea for a body design that became the 
fiberglassbody stingray 
i bought a corvette chassis for one dollar he said i 
created the stingray i wanted it to look like no other car i 
wanted to race 
gm officials had stipulated that mitchell remove all company 
logos and keep the car off gm property while he tinkered with it 
mitchell said 
he was quick to complain about todays cars 
i dont like the new corvette he told the newspaper i 
think its very bland the emblem looks like a cigar wrapper it 
has no classic look 
and most new cars all look like a bar of soap they lack 
definition he said

pope john paul ii on saturday blessed 
wheelchairbound victims of mozambiques 13year civil war and 
noted improvements in the marxist governments relations with the 
roman catholic church 
on the last portion of a 10day fivenation tour of southern 
africa the pope flew from the capital maputo to beira an indian 
ocean city of 300000 isolated except by air and water because of 
intense guerrilla activity in the region 
beira the countrys secondlargest city after maputo has been 
plagued by almost daily cuts in electricity and water shortages 
caused by sabotage from antimarxist rebels of the mozambique 
national resistance movement 
protected from a blazing sun by a thatched altar shaped like a 
native hut the pope delivered a mass at the edge of a golf course 
where the grass had been cut for the first time in 14 years local 
officials said security surrounding the pope was tight 
the picture frequently described by missionaries who live with 
you is not without shadows due to the prevailing situation of 
insecurity which generates violence anxiety and distress 
leaving limited space for freedom the pope said 
the civil war which began after mozambique gained independence 
from portugal in 1975 has forced about 1 million mozambicans to 
flee to neighboring countries relief agencies estimate 6 million 
of mozambiques 145 million populace require food aid 
at the openair mass before 50000 people the pope blessed a 
tractor driver who lost his legs when his vehicle hit a landmine 
and a young man whose legs were paralyzed after he was hit by 
bazooka fire in a rebel ambush 
port and rail links from beira reach into landlocked african 
nations and have been a frequent target of attack by rebels known 
by their portuguese acronym renamo 
the mozambican government has been openly hostile to churches in 
the past but now is working to improve strained relations 
the government recently returned churchrun schools and 
hospitals that it said were mistakenly confiscated when many such 
institutions were nationalized the rector of beira seminary 
manuel machabo said the government returned two churches in his 
area that were being used as a warehouse and a gymnasium 
in an apparent reference to antichurch government policies the 
pontiff said social ills develop when men begin shutting 
themselves off to god 
but the pope acknowledged the improvements saying i would 
like to recognize also the efforts that are being made at this 
moment for the difficulties to be overcome 
life for beiras residents remains difficult communications are 
poor stores lack many basic foods transportation is difficult and 
residents almost never travel outside the city for fear of rebel 
attacks 
but life is improving says maria do ceu a portuguese nun 
who teaches languages at a local school five years ago a piece 
of meat was an event now we have it from time to time 
later john paul spoke to about 5000 people at the airport in 
the northern city of nampula where he heard more horror stories 
about the civil war the portuguese archbishop of nampula manuel 
vieira pinto said rebels killed 8000 civilians and plundered 
about 600 towns in the past five years 
john paul also met with clergy in nampula before flying back to 
maputo where he was scheduled to speak sunday 
some mozambican bishops have urged the government to talk with 
the rebels but president joaquim chissanos government has refused 
to negotiate and has criticized the bishops for advocating talk 
with armed bandits 
the rebels have been accused of widespread civiian atrocities a 
charge they deny the us state department in an april report 
estimated the rebels have killed 100000 civilians in the last two 
to three years 
the rebels earlier announced a ceasefire during the popes 
visit and wished the pontiff a good stay 
chissano met the pope last may in rome but the vatican appears 
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an 
incentive to advancing the peace process 
mozambique ravaged by drought in recent years receives most of 
its military assistance from the soviet union but increasingly has 
been making overtures to western nations the united states is the 
largest donor of food aid in mozambique and britain has been 
providing military training

the sandinista government and 
usbacked rebels plan to resume talks monday after a threemonth 
stalemate in their search for an end to seven years of war 
both sides called the planned twoday conference in guatemala a 
preliminary step toward reopening the highlevel talks that broke 
off june 9 
the leftwing sandinistas and rebels known as contras signed 
an accord march 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict 
the government says has claimed the lives of 28000 nicaraguans 
the agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in 
exchange for democratic reforms shortly before the talks broke off 
in june the sandinistas proposed a timetable for disarmament and 
political reforms 
but the contras rejected the plan saying it did not go far 
enough they insisted on the immediate release of political 
prisoners disbanding of the supreme court and full democratic 
guarantees 
a march 21 agreement to suspend offensive military operations 
remains in place but both sides accuse the other of violating the 
truce 
the defense ministry issues frequent communiques claiming contra 
ambushes of government forces bosco matamoros spokesman for the 
rebels said recently sandinista troops attacked contra positions 
93 times in august 
earlier this month the sandinistas proposed preliminary talks in 
guatemala to be followed by a conference in managua 
the contras initially rejected the suggestion saying the 
government had restricted their movements during four earlier talks 
in managua and they would not return to the capital they also 
wanted nicaraguas opposition parties to participate in the next 
round of talks 
last weekm the rebels added a new condition they demanded the 
release of more than 40 opposition leaders arrested by police 
during a demonstration on july 10 
matamoros recently proposed sept 26 for the next highlevel 
talks to be held in a stilltobe decided location 
the sandinistas maintain the talks should be held in managua and 
that only the government and the contras take part 
overt us military aid to the rebels ended feb 29 and the 
contras have few bargaining chips left 
over the past four months most of the rebel forces fled from 
nicaragua back to base camps inside honduras where they receive 
nonlethal aid suplied by the united states 
contra sources say only 2000 fighters remain inside nicaragua 
with more than 9000 in base camps near the border in eastern 
honduras 
the rebels saying the sandinistas still get large amounts of 
sovietsupplied war materiel are seeking renewed us military aid 
both sides are anxiously awaiting the us presidential 
elections in november the sandinistas hope for a democratic 
victory by michael dukakis who opposes more contra aid while the 
republican contender vice president george bush has supported aid 
to the rebels

began and a dry summer is coming into focus even as the states 
major apple variety the mcintosh is being harvested in orchards 
across new york this weekend 
its too early to tell any numbers but this years crop is 
definitely down said lee peters a vice president of fowler 
brothers orchards in wolcott 
statewide production this year is estimated to be about 2 
million bushels down from last years 188 million bushels 
according to industry figures its also the smallest apple crop 
since 1972 
raymond lemka a fruit grower in east greenbush said he was 
just beginning his harvest and his crop is looking farily good 
but there is usually a 10day period in which mcintosh apples can 
be picked he said and any extended period of rain would be yet 
another setback 
according to the national weather service in albany a cold 
front was headed into the state and showers are likely 
in washington state the nations leading apple producer 
growers have largely avoided the drought 
a july forecast for the washington fall apple crop calls for 
total production about onethird less than the record 1987 crop 
but thats largely because trees naturally bear less fruit the year 
after a big crop the total would be about the same as the 1986 
crop

democrat michael dukakis declaring 
republican george bush has provided zero protection for the 
environment proposed saturday elevating the environmental 
protection agency to a cabinet department 
and the first secretary of the environment is going to be as 
committed to protecting the environment as george bush has been to 
neglecting it the democratic presidential candidate told a 
cheering crowd of campaign workers 
dukakis drew a roar of approval from several hundred volunteers 
when he referred to rhetorical flubs by the republican ticket 
dan quayle doesnt know what century hes in and george bush 
cant remember the pledge of allegiance he said 
from california dukakis flew to washington dc to share the 
spotlight at the annual congressional black caucus dinner with 
jesse jackson and to plead for high turnout among black voters 
acknowledging blacks will be essential to a democratic victory 
our adversaries are not just george bush and dan quayle 
dukakis said in prepared remarks our adversaries are despair and 
resignation and indifference and complacency 
he struck several themes important to blacks including civil 
rights law enforcement increasing the minimum wage support for 
black colleges and sanctions against south africas repressive 
apartheid regime 
dukakis laid out his plan for a new cabinet department at a 
rally in a union hall at which his campaign was signing up precinct 
workers for the drive to capture californias 47 electoral votes 
the biggest single prize on election day 
with politicians and pollsters agreed that the fight for 
californias critical electoral votes was currently a dead heat 
dukakis was recruiting thousands of precinct workers to his cause 
at a series of meetings across the state similar to the one at 
which dukakis spoke the campaign hoped to sign up 5000 precinct 
captains the process will be repeated on upcoming weekends in an 
effort to have a worker in each of the states 23000 precincts 
the environment is a major issue in california and one of the 
most volatile aspects is the controversy over offshore oil drilling 
following dukakis announcement national wildlife federation 
president jay d hair called it exactly the kind of presidential 
leadership needed to address some of the most complex and important 
human and environmental health issues before our society 
while the reagan administration has advocated pushing ahead with 
drilling off the california coast bush said last spring that he 
favored a delay in approving pending leases to determine if they 
were environmentally sound 
hes done more somersaults than an olympic gymnast on the 
subject of offshore drilling off the california coast said 
dukakis when hes in texas hes for it when hes in 
california he says well maybe not 
my friends we need a president who wont change his position 
with the time zone 
therell be no drilling in santa monica bay he pledged 
and were going to send the administrations fiveyear oil and 
gas leasing plan back to the drawing board 
dukakis ridiculed bushs record on the environment saying he 
calls for zero tolerance against those who poison our water with 
toxic chemicals but for seven and a half years hes provided zero 
protection for the environment of this country 
he said that as chairman of the white house task force on 
regulatory reform bush diluted delayed and destroyed scores of 
regulations to preserve the environment 
in a fact sheet distributed by the dukakis staff it was noted 
that the epa budget already is larger than those for the state and 
commerce departments and that it employs more people than the 
departments of housing and urban development and education 
the cost was described as insignificant perhaps as little 
as a few hundred thousand dollars 
dukakis spoke in front of banner that read orange county 
volunteer victory team the volunteers all received red white 
and blue dukakis for president signs and were told to put them up 
in front of their homes and urge neighbors to do the same 
dont let anybody tell you this campaign is just television 
he told the volunteers 
but the dukakis forces have an uphill fight in orange county a 
republican bastion the best democrats hope for in the area is to 
hold down the gop majority to a level they can overcome with votes 
from heavily democratic areas of the state

iraq has transformed the face of its 
northern kurdish region with battles and bulldozers and an 
official said saturday that residents of hundreds of razed villages 
were moved to new more modern towns 
the government which has accused of attacking kurdish 
separatist rebels with chemical weapons flew foreign reporters by 
helicopter to this devastated village and over much of the region 
friday and saturday 
guides ate grapes growing in one area allegedly attacked by 
chemical weapons to support the governments denial it used poison 
gas during its recent offensive against the kurds 
rebel leaders claim 4300 kurds died in iraqi gas attacks 
many other areas visible from the air have been bulldozed in 
what officials describe as a plan to concentrate iraqis throughout 
the country in towns more easily served with power water and other 
amenities 
we are bringing together the families of the villages into 
new towns of 2000 to 3000 people namuk raqib sorji the 
provincial governor told reporters in dihok 210 miles south of 
the turkish border and 250 miles north of baghdad 
the villages are isolated and farflung he said it is 
very difficult to bring services to people 
dihok is one of three governorates in iraqs kurdish region 
where about 35 million kurds live 
about 200 small villages in dihok alone have been 
eliminated the provincial governor sorji told reporters 
bamarni 12 miles south of the turkish border fell victim to 
the iraqi armys massive thrust against kurdish rebels who had 
been supported by iran the offensive began shortly after a 
unsponsored ceasefire in the eightyearold iraniraq war went 
into effect on aug 20 
a bulldozer stood on a hill overlooking the smashed concrete and 
mudbrick houses grape vines still flourished near broken bicycle 
frames old shoes and an abandoned baby doll fire had scorched the 
orchard on the towns edge there were no residents 
iraqi government escorts took reporters to what they identified 
as the balisian valley 95 miles southeast of bamarni they said it 
is where the rebels claimed gas attacks occurred but there was no 
obvious evidence of that and no people either 
the united states and several other western european states have 
urged the united nations to dispatch a team to iraq to investigate 
charges of poison gas attacks but baghdad has refused 
on a 90mile flight from sulaymaniyah to arbil geometric grids 
of new concrete dwellings rose along highways or on the outskirts 
of large towns 
western diplomats say iraq appeared to be trying to end decades 
of simmering rebellion among kurds by eliminating remote village 
sanctuaries and putting the general population into more easily 
controlled centers 
but the dihok governor said the program was a general 
decision applied across the country although outside observers 
have not noted movements on a similar scale outside the kurdish 
region 
tens of thousands of kurds from villages have fled into turkey 
and iran during the latest fighting 
in another development iraqs information minister latif 
nassayif jassim said saturday israel would pay very dearly if 
it attacked targets on the pretext they were chemical weapons 
plants the official iraqi news agency reported 
in june 1981 israel carried out what it called a preemptive 
air strike against the frenchbuilt reactor west of baghdad to 
prevent iraq from developing an atomic bomb

democrat michael dukakis ridiculed republican george bushs 
claim to be an environmentalist accusing the vice president 
saturday of flipflops on the issue of offshore oil drilling and 
comparing him to former interior secretary james watt 
the massachusetts governor speaking to campaign workers in 
anaheim calif also said he would elevate the environmental 
protection agency to a cabinetlevel department 
the first secretary of the environment is going to be as 
committed to protecting the environment as george bush has been to 
neglecting it dukakis said 
dukakis was attacking bush on one of the issues the republican 
presidential nominee has staked out for himself having declared 
last month at an appearance in michigan that he was a lifelong 
environmentalist 
the next thing you know well be hearing that james watt and 
anne gorsuch burford and rita lavelle are environmentalists 
too dukakis said 
watt who served as president reagans first interior secretary 
was a favorite target for attack by environmental groups because of 
his support for opening up previously protected land for commercial 
use mrs burford was in charge of the epa until 1983 ms lavelle 
who headed the agencys toxic waste cleanup program served three 
months in jail for lying to congress 
the sight of george bush campaigning on the coast and talking 
about his commitment to clean water reminds me of the old saying 
from television detective shows they always return to the scene of 
the crime dukakis said 
bush meanwhile on saturday was wooing the immigrant vote often 
sought by dukakis who seldom fails to mention his greekborn 
parents 
the vice president spoke briefly to a group of 174 new citizens 
from 62 countries at a naturalization ceremony in washington bush 
stood in for reagan at the event staged by the commission on the 
bicentennial of the constitution to commemorate the 201st 
anniversary of the signing of the constitution in philadelphia 
we americans have always thought of ourselves as special as a 
light shining out to the world bush told the new citizens after 
they were given the oath of citizenship by former supreme court 
chief justice warren e burger all of us from the newest 
citizen to the oldest must participate in the running of this 
country 
bushs remarks were lowkey and nonpartisan but the event gave 
him a chance to appear before television cameras flanked by the 
flag and a replica of the liberty bell and to recite the pledge of 
allegiance which has become a mainstay of his campaign 
dukakis speaking later to a crowd at the congressional black 
caucus legislative conference in washington said the elections 
stakes are particularly high for blacks 
this election is a struggle for the future of america he 
said in prepared remarks its a struggle for the soul of 
america its a struggle we must win and i need your help to do 
it 
dukakis unity message was designed to help heal what some 
regard as continued divisions within the democratic party since he 
defeated jesse jackson for the partys nomination 
together were going to build an america where we aim high 
again he said mentioning the issues of civil rights 
enforcement judicial appointments full employment the war 
against drugs and sanctions against south africas racist 
government 
in california dukakis accused bush of standing by and doing 
nothing while the administration tried to dismantle the superfund 
program for cleaning up toxic wastes he also said bush supported 
reagans veto of the clean water act and has done more 
somersaults than an olympic gymnast on the question of offshore 
drilling 
bush also came under attack saturday for his role in leading the 
administrations efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the 
united states he has said that he would appoint his vice 
presidential running mate sen dan quayle of indiana to a similar 
responsibility if the republican ticket wins the election 
speaking to a partisan crowd in the florida panhandle 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen said bush 
wants to pass the torch of failure on to the junior senator from 
indiana 
quayle meanwhile addressed a crowd of picnickers who gathered 
in the pouring rain at the farm of sen john warner rva near 
middleburg 
i call this kind of weather dukakis weather gloomy skies and 
dark clouds said quayle speaking into a microphone poking out 
of two bales of hay set up in front of warners house 
but the strongest attack came from rep ron coleman dtexas 
who delivered the democrats response to reagans weekly radio 
address with pointed references to quayles decision to serve 
public information officer in the indiana national guard during the 
vietnam war 
coleman questioned quayles fitness to lead the nations war on 
drugs 
how can he be put in charge of this war when he wouldnt fight 
in the last one we still havent forgotten the last time he was 
given the opportunity to carry a rifle for his country coleman 
said this is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press 
releases in indiana

lawya said only 96 out of 1080 supply trucks from neighboring 
uganda were able to make the journey to juba 750 miles south of

chinas premier li peng said saturday that china 
and the soviet union could hold their first summit in three decades 
if lowerlevel talks succeed 
chinas highestranking government official also denied strongly 
that the chinese leadership is divided over how to proceed with the 
nations economic reforms now riddled with inflation overspending 
and corruption 
li spoke in an interview with the associated press board of 
directors and executives it was chinas most positive response yet 
to soviet calls for an improvement in ties 
on friday soviet leader mikhail gorbachev called for full 
normalization between the two communist giants moscow and 
beijing have been politically at odds since an ideological falling 
out in 1960 
li said he welcomed such a call 
in a 40minute interview at the diaoyutai state guesthouse li 
stressed that communist party general secretary zhao ziyang often 
regarded as lis political rival has been a full participant in 
recent decisions to slow down reforms 
rumors going around the world of a serious rift in the 
leadership are groundless li said minor differences over policies 
are normal phenomena he said our top leadership is united 
li said china would like very much to normalize our relations 
with the soviet union 
he noted that china and the soviet union share 4300 miles of 
common border so the strain on relations between the two 
countries is not in the interest of china because we need to 
modernize our country in a peaceful environment 
he also emphasized that china has no intention of becoming an 
ally of the soviet union or returning to the relationship of the 
1950s when moscow acted as a big brother to the fledgling 
communist government in beijing 
the premier also refuted the idea that better chinesesoviet 
ties would be a threat to the west 
let me tell you a secret he said with a smile recently 
when your defense secretary frank carlucci was here i asked him 
some questions about the soviet military strength and he told me a 
lot of things i did not know 
li also left open the possibility of the first chinesesoviet 
summit since nikita khrushchev met mao tsetung in 1959 
gorbachev in his speech in siberia friday renewed overtures 
for a summit he first made in vladivostok in 1986 
although li noted chinas longstanding three obstacles to a 
chinesesoviet summit he seemed to play down the differences while 
emphasizing that china would like very much to normalize 
relations 
the three obstacles are the soviet troop presence in 
afghanistan the nineyear occupation of cambodia by sovietallied 
vietnam and the heavy soviet troop presence on its border with 
china 
progress recently has been made in all three areas 
he said chinesesoviet talks on cambodia in beijing last month 
had reached certain results 
he said some disagreements remain on other issues but once 
there is further agreement the subject of a summit meeting will be 
placed on the agenda 
li tried to dispel reports of dissension within chinas 
political ranks by explaining that all top decisions are made by 
the communist party politburo which is headed by party chief zhao 
and includes li 
he said decisions made in the past month to calm consumers and 
cool off the economy including a ban on further price increases 
this year were made under the directorship of general secretary 
zhao ziyang and some were proposed by him himself 
some western and hong kong reports have speculated that zhao 
who advocates bold policies of introducing marketoriented reforms 
is in trouble because of the current serious sideeffects of the 
reforms 
li said the reforms initiated by senior leader deng xiaoping 10 
years ago will proceed but there is a need to stabilize an 
economy battered by a 20percent inflation rate rising government 
deficits and uncontrolled spending on public projects 
the associated press delegation was led by william j keating 
ap board chairman and chief executive officer of the detroit 
newspaper agency and ap president and general manager louis d

a federal appeals court said lawyers who 
handle socalled public interest cases at low rates can charge the 
government the higher prevailing market rate for their work if 
they win in a suit challenging federal policy 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in an 
83 decision friday ruled that public interest lawyers are 
entitled to collect fees at the oftenhigher prevailing rate when 
they successfully challenge federal government policies 
under federal laws the government must pay the legal fees of 
the winning side in a variety of challenges to federal statutes a 
system designed to encourage private initiatives to enforce the 
law the government however has challenged the size of the fees 
judges dissenting from the appellate decision asserted that the 
ruling overturns a rational and efficient method for determining 
fees established by a ruling in 1984 and will create an 
enormous administrative burden for this court 
a former assistant us attorney who was involved in 
establishing the rule that the government would reimburse lawyers 
at the rate normally charged by their law firms said the ruling 
would create chaos 
how can you determine what the market price is he asked 
speaking on condition that he not be identified every law firm 
charges a different hourly fee 
the case arose after four lawyers successfully sued the interior 
department challenging laws that they said allowed huge mining 
companies to skirt environmental standards the lawyers represented 
save our cumberland mountains inc a citizens group based in 
tennessee 
a us district judge awarded them just under 200000 in legal 
fees for the fouryear legal battle according to one of the 
lawyers the government appealed 
a threejudge appellate panel ruled that the two lawyers should 
be compensated at a lower rate of 100 an hour finding that the 
district court judge had erred in using the prevailing market rate 
to determine the legal fees 
us appeals court judge david b sentelle in his opinion for 
the majority said the threejudge panels ruling was 
inconsistent with the intent of congress in enacting fee award 
statutes and with supreme court rulings from now on he said 
awards would be based on the prevailing market rate

taking a break from the headaches of the 
palestinian uprising and israels election campaign thousands of 
israelis turned out saturday for a canine beauty pageant 
marco a feisty boxer owned by dov amir padded off with the 
champions trophy after beating out 800 other pretty pooches in 
israels dogoftheyear contest held in tel avivs exhibition 
center 
we can find time for other things besides the intefadeh 
said organizer avi marshak using the arabic word for uprising to 
describe the 9monthold wave of palestinian violence aimed at 
ending israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
about 20000 people attended the twoday show organizers said 
israeli couples in cutoff jeans and shortsleeved shirts pushed 
baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than 50 different 
breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the yorkshire terriers to 
great danes and st bernards 
marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the world kennel club 
based in brussels belgium and had judges from the netherlands 
south africa italy and britain 
but although the competition was billed as an international 
event organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from 
abroad this was in contrast to 1987 before the uprising began 
when a world dog show competition attracted scores of foreign 
competitors to israel 
even so we dont feel the intefadeh here said rafi shahaf 
a veterinarian who was interviewed in the show ring where conan 
his steel gray mastino napoletano had just taken a blue ribbon 
the show briefly pushed the nov 1 general elections out of the 
limelight for the doglovers experts say the razortight race

president corazon aquino said friday 
she hoped the philippines and the united states could resolve their 
differences and end a deadlock over compensation and other issues 
in negotiations over us bases 
well they have their position and we have ours she said 
of the disagreement 
mrs aquino made her remarks before soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev offered to give up the soviet base at cam ranh bay 
vietnam if the united states closes its six installations in the 
philippines 
she told reporters foreign secretary raul manglapus was trying 
to narrow differences in his talks with secretary of state george 
p shultz in the united states so im hoping they will 
the filipinous talks are to set compensation and other terms 
for the final two years of the bases agreement which expires in 
1991 mrs aquino refuses to say if she will support extending the 
agreement 
on thursday shultz said in washington that the united states 
wants to keep the giant clark air base subic navy base and other 
installations but filipino money demands were too high 
us officials say washington is considering moving the bases to 
guam or other sites 
the united states now pays about 180 million a year to use the 
bases congressional sources have said washington offered to 
increase the compensation to nearly 500 million including 
doubling direct basesrelated aid to 360 million 
manila newspapers say the philippines has demanded up to 12 
billion a year although manglapus refuses to confirm that figure 
many filipinos see the bases as an odious vestige of american 
rule here which ended with philippine independence in 1946 
in addition manglapus and other officials maintain the bases do 
not serve philippine interests because the country does not 
perceive an external threat 
last week deputy foreign secretary jose ingles told a meeting 
of nonaligned nations in nicosia cyprus that the bases may 
threaten national security by making the philippines a target in a 
future superpower confrontation

the 36page report recommended better training for personnel 
modification of some equipment and an improved radio network 
it stressed the unfavorable circumstances caused by a 
passenger who pulled an alarm to automatically stop the suburban 
train shortly before it was to enter paris at rush hour june 27 
the train restarted then hurled without breaks into the 
station crashing into a standing train about to depart 
the report said that from the moment the conductor tried 
rearming the breaks after the unscheduled stop a series of 
technical and human errors took place 
the report noted that a radio alert was given just 1 minutes 
before the accident while loudspeakers warned of the impending 
crash just 30 seconds in advance leaving passengers on the 
standing train little time to evacuate most of the dead were in 
the standing train 
transport minister michel delebarre said the report had been 
handed over to the head of the train authority jacques fournier 
for study before a board meeting scheduled for oct 26

the justice department has advised the 
canadian and illinoisbased makers of railroad maintenance 
equipment that it will file a lawsuit to block their proposed joint 
manufacturing venture a department official said friday 
the 30 million project proposed by ivaco inc of montreal and 
jackson jordan inc of schaumburg ill would violate federal 
antitrust laws said charles f rule the assistant attorney 
general in charge of the departments antitrust division 
in a statement issued late friday rule said the venture might 
lessen competition in the production and sale of automatic tampers 
large pieces of equipment used to level and allign railroad tracks 
the proposed joint venture would control over 70 percent of 
the automatic tampers sold in the united states he said we 
are particularly concerned because it would reduce to only two 
the number of united states sellers of automatic tampers as a 
result railroad companies would face higher prices 
sales of the tampers totalled about 15 million last year the 
justice department said 
ivaco is the largest domestic producer of the equipment made by 
its canron inc subsidiary at plants in columbia sc toronto 
and queensland australia the department said 
it said jackson jordan which produces tampers at a plant in 
ludington mich ranks third in us production behind plasser amp 
theurer of austria which operates a plant in chesapeake va 
a receptionists answering the telephone at jackson jordan 
headquarters said the companys offices were closed for the weekend 
and that officials could not be reached for comment calls to ivaco 
in montreal were unanswered

the environmental protection agency must 
decide by march 13 whether to regulate benzene emissions from at 
least nine additional sources according to a federal judges 
ruling 
the ruling by us district judge june l green declined 
however to impose a deadline sought by an environmental group for 
tightening controls on evaporation of gasoline one source of 
benzene from cars 
benzene is a major chemical building block for producing other 
chemicals breathing benzene causes leukemia according to studies 
of industrial workers 
though epa has made decisions about several sources of benzene 
and is considering major regulations for some of them the judge 
said the clean air act requires the agency to make explicit 
decisions on benzene emissions from other sources the agency has 
identified plants making ethylene chlorobenzene nitrobenzene 
linear alkyl benzene and cyclohexane chemical and refinery waste 
disposal industrial solvent usage and the bulk handling and 
transportation of gasoline 
if the agency decides these sources deserve regulation it must 
adopt regulations within six months the judge said in the ruling 
issued thursday 
epa expects to adopt a tightening of auto gasoline evaporation 
regulations by the end of the year 
david doniger attorney for the natural resources defense 
council the plaintiff in the case said friday the ruling applied 
to all hazardous air pollutants over which epa has jurisdiction 
epa cant just pick one source regulate it and say thats 
it doniger said 
the sources in question were identified in the 1970s but just 
dropped off the agencys scopes he said 
alan eckart associate general counsel of epa said we have a 
lot of doubt whether she had jurisdiction to issue the order and 
for the plaintiff the proper way would have been a petition to 
use to regulate those sources however he said epa has not 
decided whether to appeal

the justice department is reviewing 40 
breakins at offices and residences of political opponents of the 
reagan administrations central america policies fbi director 
william sessions told congress on friday 
the department sessions told a house subcommittee is trying to 
determine whether there were violations of civil rights in the 
breakins which in most cases are unsolved 
government lawyers are reviewing the incidents on the basis that 
the unidentified people committing the crimes may have conspired to 
inhibit the victims from carrying out their constitutional rights 
to petition congress 
the fbi already has said it has found nothing to suggest the 
burglaries are connected to each other and has ascertained no 
pattern to them 
a member of the house subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights rep robert kastenmeier dwis theorized that the 
breakins possibly could be politically motivated and are being 
carried out by salvadorans in this country or by intelligence 
assets of the fbi 
subcommittee chairman don edwards dcalif suggested the 
salvadoran national guard which critics of the salvadoran 
government say is linked to rightwing death squads in that 
country also might be in contact with those conducting the 
breakins 
sessions told the panel that kastenmeiers and edwards theories 
may be correct but that the bureau has nothing to substantiate 
them 
reagan administration critics have suggested the fbi might be 
involved in the breakins but bureau officials have said they have 
found no evidence of that 
sessions said it is important for the american public to know 
that it is not the bureau involved in the burglaries and he said 
he looks forward to being able to respond to inquiries by 
edwards that the bureau had nothing to do with them and i hope 
that it is always that way 
at one of the locations under review in the justice department 
examination the old cambridge baptist church in cambridge mass 
has been burglarized 10 times since 1984 
the church houses the new england central american network a 
coalition of 150 organizations opposing us military intervention 
in central america and organizing food shipments to nicaragua 
edwards last may sent sessions a list of breakins at the homes 
churches and offices of people opposed to us policy in central 
america 
he wants the justice department to conduct more widely focused 
probes of the burglaries on the basis that they interfere with 
first amendment rights not just on the narrow question of whether 
the groups lobby congress 
edwards list of breakins in a may 4 letter totaled more than 
70 edwards says there now are some 100 breakins that appear to 
fit the pattern of being targeted at central american policy 
opponents

despite some criticism that his call for 
an evacuation of the island was unnecessary city manager doug 
matthews said friday he made the decision because his primary 
interest was in saving lives 
by friday morning about 65 percent of the 65000 galveston 
residents were off the island with 40 percent of them leaving 
before the evacuation recommendation was given matthews said 
matthews said his decision to call for evacuation was based in 
part on a report by the texas department of public safety that the 
hurricane could hit near freeport if it turned northward overnight 
the report said if that happened friday morning would be too 
late to evacuate the entire island which takes 17 hours 
about 90 percent of the businesses were closed on the island 
friday many homes and businesses were boarded up its like a 
ghost town around here matthews said 
as gilberts center moved onto the northern mexican shore friday 
afternoon however forecasters lifted a hurricane watch for the 
upper texas coast at 2 pm and galveston officials rescinded their 
evacuation recommendation 
dps officials in austin said the data may have been 
misinterpreted by galveston officials and that evacuation may have 
been premature 
but matthews said friday he did not misinterpret the data and 
that it was just one piece of information used to decide whether to 
evacuate 
even if the hurricane misses the galveston area the economic 
impact caused by lost tourist dollars and closed businesses could 
top 70 million city manager doug matthews said friday 
at least 30 area school districts were closed friday and 
athletic and cultural events were postponed because of the 
hurricanes threat nasas johnson space center sent all but a few 
employees home thursday and closed the center to tourists 
in houston traffic was lighter than usual friday morning as 
area schools colleges and some businesses decided not to open but 
many other businesses decided against closing as the threat of 
gilbert waned 
tenneco inc which employs nearly 4000 people in the area 
remained open friday as did shell oil co with its 13000 houston 
workers 
suzanne thomas a tenneco spokeswoman said it was business as 
usual friday despite the threat earlier this week the storm might 
hit the area she said the company had no problems conducting 
business 
we stayed open most of the downtown businesses did ms 
thomas said 
the bankers association said houston banks also were open friday 
in hindsight matthews said he would have made the same decision 
because he was more concerned about saving lives than anything 
else in texas officials may recommend an evacuation but they 
cannot order people from their homes 
although the storm has forced many businesses to close and send 
employees home it has meant big sales to some other companies 
panicbuying this week cleared the shelves of many grocery 
stores in the area and sales also were booming at lumber and 
hardware stores but sales could slow later as people use up their 
hurricane provisions 
and although oil prices increased earlier this week partly 
because of the storm the decreasing chance that gilbert would 
seriously disrupt energy production in the gulf helped curb the 
recent rally 
oil and gas companies operating in the gulf evacuated many of 
their personnel from refineries and oil platforms but observers 
said the prospect of major disruption in oil supplies had waned

when the syndicated television show 
entertainment tonight planned a show on media hoaxers they 
contacted veteran hoaxer joey skaggs who quickly hoaxed them by 
sending a friend to do the interview 
how could i resist skaggs asked after the program aired 
friday night i mean who did they think they were dealing with 
skaggs speaking by telephone from his manhattan apartment was 
ecstatic after viewing the opening segment on the show which 
featured cohost mary hart delivering this caveat 
the hoaxers are honest enough to admit they enjoy the 
attention but their bottom line is this let the talk show 
bookers the newspaper assignment editors and the viewers beware 
laughed skaggs the only problem is they didnt take their own 
advice 
joey pulled a fast one on us said et producer kevin 
narblock from los angeles adding he suspected skaggs might have 
been up to something when a picture of the hoaxer in penthouse 
magazine didnt match the fellow on the film 
hart introduced the phony skaggs played by writerteacher 
norman savage by detailing a hoax perpetrated on good morning 
america where skaggs offered a cure for the common cold the 
common cockroach 
savage wearing a pair of dark sunglasses then says what i 
hope to achieve is that the public becomes more skeptical and if 
theyre more skeptical maybe theyre more discerning more 
demanding and so the media then has to police themselves a 
little better 
skaggs said he was doubly tickled because he had appeared 
previously on entertainment tonight so the program should have 
footage of what he really looks like

major american motion picture exporters asked 
anew friday for us government intervention to enable them to 
operate film distribution offices in south korea 
the motion picture export association of america in a formal 
unfair trade complaint to the us trade representative accused 
south korea of violating a 1985 agreement permitting independent 
us distribution of major hollywood productions of discrimination 
and of failure to crack down on pirating of video cassettes 
announcing the action mpeaa chairman jack valenti told 
reporters the south korean film importing and distributing industry 
has launched a very aggressive attack to make sure that americans 
never get to open their own offices as promised in 1985 
seoul cinema houses bypassing local distributors to deal 
directly with the american exporters have been threatened with 
having live snakes let loose in their theaters to frighten away 
audiences valenti said quoting korean press reports 
two seoul cinemas that made direct bookings with the us 
exporters to show fatal attraction and batteries not 
included pictures that were hits elsewhere in asia were 
expelled from their industry association and may be forced to 
cancel the openings later this month valenti said 
it is a coincidence that the trade complaint is being filed at 
the start of the seoul olympic games when korea is at the center 
of international attention valenti said mpeaa has been warning 
for weeks it would take action unless korean authorities agreed to 
negotiate the issues and a recent meeting with the south korean 
ambassador produced no results he said 
the south korean embassy did not respond immediately to requests 
for comment on the mpeaa complaints 
the 1985 accord allowed mpeaa companies to import and distribute 
their motion pictures in korea he said that accord prompted mpeaa 
to withdraw an earlier formal complaint it had filed with the us 
trade representative charging unfair trade 
but three years later the countrys domestic film distribution 
industry literally defying their government has made it 
economically impossible for us exporters to operate distribution 
offices valenti said 
valenti said south korea is the only country outside the soviet 
bloc where the us film industry cannot freely operate its own 
distribution system and split profits directly with cinemas south 
koreas 673 cinemas showed 11 mpeaa pictures in 1984 18 in 1985 
28 in 1986 30 in 1987 and nine the first half of this year he 
said 
but independent us filmmakers not belonging to mpeaa operate 
in south korea by selling films outright and 75 percent of the 
movie houses show american pictures valenti acknowledged

nancy clark rode her sailboard over 
the northern edge of hurricane gilbert on friday to the cheers of a 
surfside crowd that gathered after word their city would be spared 
the brunt of the hurricane 
much of corpus christi seemed abandoned friday but ocean drive 
was jammed with traffic as residents and tourists flocked to the 
citys seawall with the news that gilbert would hit farther south 
than expected 
the eye of the hurricane came ashore friday afternoon about 120 
miles south of brownsville or about 280 miles from corpus christi 
scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road in 
corpus christi as bicyclists joggers and windsurfers were joined 
by crowds of residents complaining of cabin fever in their 
boardedup homes 
this is definitely the advanced class said ms clark a 
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35mph winds after 
fleeing port isabel near brownsville 
this definitely rates a 10 but its also a good day for 
conservative positive sailing said corpus christi architect 
robert jones one of about a halfdozen surfers who rode high tides 
at 4 feet above normal levels 
i was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up 
getting kind of bored said jones i decided id just get out 
here and see what the winds were like 
many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay in corpus 
christi had heard repeated warnings that gilbert would likely turn 
toward the north striking land near brownsville and bashing corpus 
christi with heavy wind and rain 
but when the hurricane stayed on its course toward mexico the 
seawall swelled with confident crowds 
most people probably wouldnt expect to see this many people 
down here in a hurricane but once youve lived in corpus christi 
for a while you come to expect the unusual out of the residents 
said russ roland who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the 
seawall 
families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the 
concrete steps and children danced along the edge of the churning 
water mugging for cameras 
many including doug reiter said they just grew tired of 
sitting inside a house darkened by plywoodcovered windows 
i think everybody is just bored and this is kind of a release 
from being cooped up he said you can only take that sort of 
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy

quality inns international inc must stop using 
the name mcsleep inns for its economy hotels because the public 
would believe the hotels are owned by the fastfood giant 
mcdonalds corp a judge ruled friday 
us district judge paul niemeyer said the use of the prefix 
mc is a deliberate attempt to benefit by the good will and 
reputation of mcdonalds 
he granted mcdonalds a permanent injuction and gave quality 
inns 30 days to comply with the injunction 
the company immediately responded to the injunction by changing 
the name of their new hotel chain to sleep inns which will 
offer a nights lodging for 20 to 29 the first two sleep 
inns will break ground next week in nova scotia canada and 
salisbury nc the company said 
the last thing we wanted for our lodging product is to be 
confused with some hamburger chain said gerald petitt executive 
vice president and chief operating officer for quality inns 
well change the name to eliminate any chance of anyone being 
confused 
last september quality inns based in silver spring announced 
the new chain of economy hotels to be marketed under the name 
mcsleep inns 
three days later mcdonalds demanded that the name not be used 
after repeated warnings from mcdonalds quality inns filed suit 
against the hamburger chain asking the court to declare that 
mcsleep does not infringe on the chains trademark quality 
inns said the mcsleep name was selected because it connotes a 
clear impression of value 
mcdonalds countersued quality inns in us district court in 
baltimore charging that the use of the name constitutes an 
infringement and that the public will confuse the hotels with 
mcdonalds 
niemeyer heard the case without a jury in july 
the court has reaffirmed the rights of our customers not to be 
confused or mislead by companies trying to profit from our name and 
image chuck rubner a mcdonalds spokesman said friday

george bush has dropped a line from his stock 
campaign speech the one about being the underdog and liking it 
little more than a month ago the vice president was trailing 
democrat michael dukakis in national public opinion polls by double 
digits now most polls show bush has seized the agenda and is 
either leading dukakis or is even with him 
political professionals offer differing explanations for bushs 
rapid rise but most suggest a combination of factors his 
wellreceived convention address a series of speeches that put 
dukakis on the defensive and the failure of questions over running 
mate dan quayles military record to stick as a major liability 
some analysts also cite quick damage control on the part of 
bushs campaign team led by campaign chairman james a baker iii 
in minimizing possible embarrassments such as the quick 
resignations last week of bush operative frederic malek and six 
members of an ethnic coalition after allegations of antisemitic

the organization of american states facing

according to oas sources 
the crisis is based largely on the reagan administrations 
decision to reduce its 1988 contribution to the oas by 10 million 
and by the same amount next year compounding the problem is the 
failure of several other major contributors including chile and 
venezuela to keep their payments current the sources said 
the impending layoffs have generated gloom and uncertainty among

the rising land costs and traffic 
jams of modern amsterdam are changing the face of the canal 
belt the citys cultural and economic core since the middle of 
the 14th century 
the industry that has operated there for centuries has moved to 
the suburbs leaving behind a 35percent employment rate in the 
area and bringing yuppylike gentrification and skyrocketing rents 
to neighborhoods that hadnt changed much since the 17th century 
the latest and the last of the industries to depart was klenes 
candy factory which had permeated its neighborhood with the 
distinct aroma of licorice since it opened in 1915 
klenes factory moved to a modern 95million plant in hoorn 
20 miles north 
we left for a number of reasons but the catastrophic traffic 
situation here was the most important one said hans hilarius 
klenes managing director 
the company serves about 10 percent of the dutch licorice market 
with yearly sales amounting to the guilder equivalent of 4 million 
as klenes output more than tripled over the past decade 
getting the ingredients mainly sugar and starch in and the 
licorice and peppermint out became an almost impossible task 
because of the canal belts old narrow streets hilarius said in a 
recent interview 
the daily average was five 20ton trucks with raw materials 
and the finished product a day said hilarius the trucks had to 
run an obstacle course of traffic jams on the 8foot wide street 
along the looiersgracht canal 
industrial activity within amsterdams city center had been 
declining since the mid1960s when the city developed huge 
industrial zones in the deepwater port area west of the city 
but development of the industrial zone was stunted by the 1973 
oil crisis recession 
instead of industrial giants coming in it was small to 
mediumsized businesses that took refuge from heavy traffic and 
high land leases in the cityowned industrial zones city leases 
which serve as a sort of real estate tax have increased from the 
equivalent of 120 a square foot in 1978 to 4 now 
an amsterdam chamber of commerce survey indicated that during 
the last eight months of 1986 more than 800 such firms moved out 
of the 23squaremile canal belt taking with them them some 2200 
jobs 
among the major departures was the heineken brewery which 
shifted its main brewery to zoeterwoude 25 miles south of the 
capital and kept only its head office and a demonstration plant 
for tourist tours in the capital 
it worries us greatly that 35 percent of the city centers 
work force is now unemployed said chamber of commerce chairman 
rob de vilder and most of the companies that left employed 
lowgrade labor 
amsterdams average unemployment rate is 184 percent well 
above the national figure of 14 percent klenes 85member work 
force was made up of unskilled laborers 
hilarius said he unsuccessfully tried to buy city land for a new 
plant in the cramped city center city hall spokesman harald ytsma 
said however no municipal land had been sold since 1896 when the 
city adopted a leaseonly policy to have tighter control over land 
use 
part of the areas unemployment problem stems from the 
traditional reluctance of dutch workers to commute to jobs outside 
their own cities with the majority of the commuting class white 
collar employees 
de vilder of the chamber of commerce minimizes the problem of 
industry abandoning the city center saying other smaller business 
are taking its place 
the city is losing lots of unskilled jobs but on the other 
hand thousands of small businesses are opening their doors every 
year he said 
what is industrial activity in our view a small computer 
repair company also is industrial activity and such firms abound 
in the inner city 
that shift has prompted a gentrification that is turning 
historic workingclass neighborhoods like the canalwoven jordaan 
into upscale neighborhoods 
with most city jobs now in the banking commerce media and 
tourism sectors de vilder says unskilled workers should be 
induced to commute to outoftown jobs 
but blue collar attachment to inner city neighborhoods is often 
stronger than the draw of jobs in a strange city 
one elderly jordaan woman signalled that bittersweet attachment 
when she told a new whitecollar neighbor if it werent for 
people like you my son could afford to live in this neighborhood

as the season approaches for yearend tax 
planning investors face the possibility that some standard 
timetested strategies might not work so well this year 
in normal circumstances the main idea in yearend maneuvering 
for tax purposes is to minimize the tax liability from investments 
you would incur for the current years tax return 
to do that you could use any one of several techniques for 
postponing realization of capital gains until the new year arrives 
in addition you might sell an investment that has performed 
poorly before yearend taking a loss to offset profitable sales 
made earlier in the year or to reduce your other income by as much 
as 3000 
advisers on tax matters have traditionally urged their clients 
to take these steps early so as not to be caught in the 
latenovember and december rush 
but thanks to the elections the federal budget deficit and the 
possibility of additional changes in the tax code before too long 
many of the experts are hesitating to make the usual 
recommendations right now 
as standard amp poors corp put it in its advisory publication 
the outlook 
keep in mind that shifting investment gains forward to 1989 
could be the wrong move if tax rates rise next year a possibility 
that certainly cant be ruled out 
on the other hand the next tax hike could come in a package 
that would lower capital gains tax rates 
adds william brennan a valley forge pa adviser on tax and 
investment planning ingrained in our subconscious is the notion 
we must delay income taxes as long as possible 
1988 may be the year to purge ourselves of this preconception 
the 28 percent tax rate wont last forever 
the idea of postponing tax liabilities rests on a solid 
foundation known as the time value of money the longer you can 
legally put off the time of reckoning the longer you have the use 
of the money and its earning power 
many longterm investment strategies are geared to delaying 
taxes until after you retire when you presumably fall into a lower 
tax bracket than you occupied in your peak earning years 
the problem is the virtues of tax postponement come into 
question when you do not know what future tax rates will be 
no matter what is said during the presidential election 
campaign many financial observers believe revenueraising 
proposals will be made next year because of the need mandated by 
law to narrow the federal budget deficit 
nevertheless some observers say there is a case to be made for 
waiting longer than usual to decide on 1988 tax strategies if you 
think or hope that the rest of the campaign and the results of 
the nov 8 elections will help to clarify the tax outlook for next 
year and beyond 
no matter what the future may hold there is a natural human 
tendency to want to reduce the current years tax burden if only 
for the emotional satisfaction that comes with a refund in the 
spring 
for investors planning to sell losing investments before 
yearend experts offer the reminder that they must avoid what the 
internal revenue service calls a wash sale 
if you sell an investment and repurchase it within 30 days 
either before or after the date of the sale the loss from the 
sale does not qualify for any deduction 
in the unusual environment that prevails this year tax advisers 
agree one old precept still applies while tax planning is 
important shortterm tax considerations should never become so 
paramount in your mind that you permit them to lead you astray from 
your longterm plans and goals

living in this coastal town elwot avery 
learned to pay careful attention to the weather and on the 
afternoon of sept 21 1938 his nose told him to expect an 
autumnal souwester 
it soon became clear it was something much worse trees were 
already down when a twocar garage was lifted by the winds before 
his eyes 
it went up whole like a kite and flew on over the tops of 
the trees and smashed in the road just like so much kindling 
wood recalls avery now 89 
impelled beyond reason to see more avery left his wife and 
stepped outside 
his hilltop home had become an island neighboring houses were 
swamped in 5 feet of water the wind nearly blew him off his feet 
he crawled back on his hands and knees 
the great new england hurricane of 1938 which had turned inland 
virtually without warning was the worst natural disaster to hit 
the region its torrential rains 30foot waves and 186 mph winds 
pulverized granite seawalls twisted railroad tracks like spaghetti 
and leveled whole forests 
moreover the storm was aimed like a giant wrecking ball at the 
most densely populated part of the country the socalled gold 
coast between new york and boston it wiped out 4500 homes and 
badly damaged 15000 other buildings smashed 26000 cars sank 
6000 boats and tore down nearly 20000 miles of electric lines 
the death toll was generally calculated at 580 killed 100 
missing nowhere was it heavier per capita than in westerly a town 
of barely 20000 inhabitants today and fewer then 
within hours of the storms passing the old westerly high 
school became a temporary morgue where bodies eventually more 
than 100 were brought for identification 
avery as owner of a funeral home was put in charge since all 
the telephone lines were down he got a ham radio operator to order 
a truckload of caskets then he worked round the clock for three 
days living on tomato soup and whiskey to bury the dead 
among them was his own mother whose beachside cottage had been 
smashed to pieces by huge waves the last time anyone saw her 
alive he says she was standing in the surf holding the handle of 
a suitcase the suitcase itself had been torn away by the wind 
there were similar scenes of terror everywhere the hurricane 
struck from long island to maine 
as the waves swept through downtown providence people ran for 
higher ground some drowned in the streets 
claire powell who was 9 years old remembers the terror she 
felt when her father did not come home that night 
it turned out he climbed a light pole and hung on until he was 
rescued she says still exuding relief 50 years later 
short circuits caused by flooding set off the worst fire that 
new london conn had seen since benedict arnold and the british 
torched the city in 1781 the flames quickly consumed 30 buildings 
and threatened the entire business district 
firefighters floundering in water above their waists watched 
in frustration as the hurricane blew the spray from their hoses 
back into their faces only a shift in the wind saved the city 
across the region the storm cut power transportation and 
telephones isolating whole communities in somerville mass 
physicians delivered babies by candlelight 
as the connecticut river rose 25 feet and spilled over its 
banks 10000 people were evacuated from lowlying areas of 
springfield mass 
after the flooding came looting fall river marlboro and 
northampton mass were under martial law national guardsmen with 
fixed bayonets patroled providence and westerly 
but there were also many instances of heroism 
the new haven railroads bostonian express was trapped with 600 
aboard by floodwaters at a trestle near stonington conn hulks of 
cottages and boats slammed against the cars passengers screamed as 
the train swayed dangerously 
the engineer ordered everyone into the first car and the tender 
of his locomotive wading into shoulderdeep water he uncoupled 
the other cars then climbed back aboard and opened the throttle 
nudging aside a house that had been tossed onto the tracks and 
driving the locomotive inchbyinch across the buckling trestle to 
safety 
on open water it was a rare boat that was able to ride out the 
storm in somerset mass a 600foot oil tanker was tossed ashore 
in warwick ri the wind picked up a 30foot sloop like a toy and 
deposited it 40 feet above the ground in the branches of an elm 
where it remained perched and little damaged 
katherine phillips of providence was blown halfamile across 
narragansett bay clinging to a wooden door 
mary haggerty of east providence looked out the window of the 
small office building where she was working and realized it was 
floating in the seekonk river she made her way to the roof as the 
building swept toward the india point bridge at the moment of 
impact she grabbed the bridges rail and held on 
in hartford the clock in the old state house stopped at 410 
pm an 80 mph wind the highest recorded in the city tore off 
roofs uprooted trees and toppled buildings 
in boston the historic frigate constitution was ripped from its 
moorings and damaged throughout the city windows bent then burst 
out toward the wind showering the streets with glass some 2000 
injuries were reported 
the hurricanes damage in 1938 dollars was estimated at 400 
million the equivalent of several billion dollars today but some 
observers believe its effects went well beyond damage to property 
and loss of life 
it has been described as an act of god in an age of 
innocence says everett s allen who covered the storm as a 
reporter for the standardtimes of new bedford and wrote a book 
about it a wind to shake the world in 1976 
we lived at that time with a general sense that things would 
always remain largely as they were what the storm proved at first 
blush was that landmarks do not have to endure he says

the radios of the day 50 years ago crackled with 
the news adolf hitler neville chamberlain edouard daladier and 
benito mussolini had gathered to keep the world at peace the four 
men leaders of germany britain france and italy came away from 
their conference in the belief they had succeeded this was munich 
1938 not only did their pact fail but it provided a spark that 
ignited world war ii 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a little past 1 am on sept 30 
1938 in the headquarters of the nazi party here the leaders of 
germany britain france and italy signed the munich pact and told 
the world war had been averted 
i believe it is peace in our time trumpeted prime minister 
neville chamberlain of britain 
a year later world war ii started 
instead of being appeased by the dismemberment of 
czechoslovakia as the munich pact provided germanys adolf hitler 
invaded poland 
the pact was in fact one of the great stepping stones toward 
war 
a half century later world politics is still being shaped by 
the lessons learned the lessons unlearned and the lessons 
forgotten from the munich pact 
the sort of attitude lets not have another munich has 
become a way of thinking about international politics particularly 
on the more conservative side said reinhold meyers a west 
german political scientist and specialist on the munich pact 
meyers added that is at least partially reflected in the 
continuing mistrust between east and west 
munich has become a sort of ideological catchword because it 
stands for a policy of capitulation meyers said in an interview 
the munich talks were a lastditch attempt led by chamberlain 
to appease hitlers militaristic craving for lebensraum living 
space and avoid war 
hitler was threatening to invade czechoslovakia which would 
have triggered an immediate european war because of frances 
commitment to protect the czechs and britains alliance with the 
french 
the munich pact was not only one of the most important steps 
leading to world war ii but it has also become a symbol of 
successful political blackmail said hermann graml a top west 
german historian 
chamberlain premier edouard daladier of france hitler and his 
ally in italy dictator benito mussolini began the munich 
conference on sept 29 1938 
czechoslovak leaders were excluded as hitler demanded 
the site of the talks a long threestory barrackslike 
structure built just three years earlier still stands and is a 
music school 
but hitlers private office where the four leaders met 
disappeared long ago in postwar renovations 
firsthand accounts of the fourpower meeting describe the nazi 
leader as extremely volatile and ready to wage war if he wasnt 
given czechoslovakias germanspeaking sudetenland 
hitler was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood a very 
unattractive character the british statesman lord home who 
accompanied chamberlain as his aide said in a recent interview 
with the associated press at his estate in scotland 
daladier writing years after the meeting said of the start of 
the discussions hitler arose and delivered a diatribe against 
the czechs it was a real explosion spreading his arms or 
clenching his fists he accused the czechs of a frightful tyranny 
over the sudeten germans 
historians say hitler had used the argument of 
selfdetermination for czechoslovakias minority germans as a 
propaganda device to justify his claims upon the bordering nation 
what he really believed in was the right of supposedly 
racially superior germans to dominate other people graml a 
munich university professor said during an interview at his office 
at one point during the discussions chamberlain objected to 
hitlers stipulation that czechs who would evacuate their nations 
11000squaremile sudetenland an area slightly larger than 
maryland could not even take their cattle 
paul schmidt hitlers translator during the conference wrote 
in later years that the nazi leader responded impatiently our 
time is too valuable to be wasted on such trivialities 
chamberlain dropped the matter 
faced with a hostile nazi leader who appeared ready to throw all 
of europe into war if he didnt get what he wanted the munich pact 
was signed 
leaders from all over the world welcomed the agreement and what 
looked like a lastminute escape from war 
but winston churchill said the pact had shamed his country 
you were given the choice between war and dishonor 
churchill told chamberlain later you chose dishonor and will 
have war 
hitler was given the sudetenland but it quickly became obvious 
he had no intention of keeping his vow to be satisfied with just 
that 
in march 1939 german troops overran the rest of czechoslovakia 
six months later german troops marched into poland and soon the 
worlds major powers including france and britain were embroiled 
in a war that did not end until nazi germanys defeat in may 1945 
many modernday historians like meyers say chamberlain had no 
choice but to sign the munich pact arguing that britain could not 
have withstood a major war at that time 
the british could not afford to go to war in september 1938 
because of the negative status of its air force and they had 
hardly any expeditionary force at all said meyers a professor 
at muenster university 
but the munich pact has left a lot of bitter memories 
some french historians say the munich accord may be one reason 
there has never been a strong french pacifist movement since world 
war ii 
politically mentally pacifism was killed by munich said 
jeanpierre azema a historian at paris political science 
institute 
the czechoslovaks the sacrificial victims of the munich pact 
also have bitter recollections of the infamous accord 
czechoslovakia was rebuilt after world war ii and communist 
leaders were installed 
this past february milos jakes czechoslovakias new communist 
party leader defended the communist takeover in 1948 as a 
guarantee that the nations alliance with the soviet union had rid 
it of dependence on imperialist states for which a tragic price 
was paid after munich 
but hitlers invasion was replayed 30 years later with the 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia that crushed the 1968 
prague spring reform movement

with loyalty unshaken by hindsight 
lord home neville chamberlains aide at the 1938 munich pact talks 
with adolf hitler defends an episode long ranked among the most 
shameful in british history 
chamberlain decided to continue with this peaceful diplomacy 
in order to try to persuade hitler that war would be a tragedy not 
only for germany but for europe home pronounced hume said in 
an interview as the 50th anniversary of the munich pact approached 
he thought that hitler must be sufficiently reasonable to 
understand that 
chamberlain bought peace but hitler quickly overran all of 
czechoslovakia and started world war ii with his invasion of poland 
in 1939 
winston churchill chamberlains successor as prime minister in 
1940 sharply assailed his predecessor for signing the munich pact 
chamberlain died haunted by the words he blurted out to cheering 
crowds outside no 10 downing st on sept 30 1938 as he 
brandished the piece of paper hed brought home that day 
i believe it is peace in our time 
home who as sir alec douglashome served as prime minister 
himself in 196364 sticks to a generous judgment of the leader he 
served as parliamentary private secretary from 1937 to 1940 
if you are a prime minister leading a democracy and you want 
the nation to go united into a war then youve got to carry 
diplomacy as far as you conceivably can home said in the 
interview at his 50room estate castlemains 
home at 85 is still active politically as a member of the 
unelected house of lords 
selfeffacing and impeccably mannered home recalls both the 
chilling details and the vain hopes of the facetoface talks with 
hitler 
hitler was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood a very 
unattractive character he said 
but chamberlain was concerned to get this bit of paper out of 
him which hed drafted that morning himself saying that britain 
and germany would settle their differences by peaceful means so a 
bit of that short time was taken up with that 
the rest consisted of allowing hitler to annex the sudetenland 
from czechoslovakia which the nazis overran entirely the following 
march six months later german troops marched into poland and 
chamberlain finally declared war on sept 3 1939 
chamberlain home said never expressed any regrets about the 
munich pact but knew hed blundered with his peace in our time 
remark 
as soon as he said the words he knew that hed made a mistake 
because it was an unjustifiable claim home added 
hed gone back to downing street from the aerodrome the 
crowds were enormous i was inside we were packed like sardines 
and i heard somebody on the staircase say to him well neville 
go up to the historic window and say peace in our time 
and he turned on whoever it was i couldnt see who is was 
and said i dont do that kind of thing and somebody in the 
next four or five yards must have said oh neville look at the 
crowd go on do it and thats how it happened 
home said the justification for munich is that it saved a vital 
year for british air rearmament 
it could have made all the difference between victory and 
defeat 
to churchill who replaced chamberlain as prime minister in may 
1940 britain chose shame at munich 
we have sustained a defeat without war the consequences of 
which will travel far with us along our road he declared in the 
house of commons

when premier edouard daladier returned to france 50 
years ago after signing the munich pact with adolf hitler neville 
chamberlain and benito mussolini he received a delirious heros 
welcome 
in most french eyes he had saved their country and averted war 
but today for many french citizens the munich pact and the name 
daladier are synonymous with appeasement even cowardice it also 
may be one of the reasons why the pacifist movement has never 
gained much ground in france 
to criticize somebody as a munichois is an insult said 
jeanpierre azema a historian at paris prestigious political 
science institute somebody who lacks courage is called 
munichois 
yet at the time the agreement that gave czechoslovakias 
sudetenland to germany was approved by 6065 percent of the french 
people despite french military accords with the prague government 
in force since world war i 
but the french themselves became the victims of hitlers 
ambitions when the nazis occupied france in 1940 
daladier then minister of war was interned by the 
collaborationist vichy government in 1943 he was taken to germany 
and imprisoned until the end of the war 
daladier never recovered politically he died in 1970 having 
never again held office 
even though his attitude during the war was irreproachable he 
never recuperated politically because of munich said azema 
the munich generation is now in its twilight years the majority 
of todays frenchmen have no firsthand memory of the times its 
dangers its fears its politics 
nonetheless munich remains a strong symbol 
i have the impression that it rendered the french 
nonpacifist said azema noting stronger movements in other 
european countries 
politically mentally pacifism was killed by munich no 
french politician can support a pacifist policy a pacific policy 
yes but not a pacifist policy

the son of benito mussolini remembers that italys 
fascist dictator like prime minister neville chamberlain of 
britain thought the munich pact of 1938 had saved the world from 
war 
i remember he came home from munich and said peace is 
safe said vittorio mussolini who was 22 when his father went 
to the munich conference 
but giovanni spadolini the republican president of todays 
italian senate and a professor of contemporary history at the 
univeristy of florence said the munich agreement to cede the 
czechoslovakias sudentenland to germany generated negative 
beliefs within the dictatorships and within the democracies 
hitler was convinced that france and great britain would never 
have gone to war to defend the eastern states said spadolini 
mussolini who had taken a role that was unnatural for him 
that of the apostle of peace was convinced of playing a 
determinant role within the axis above all munich contributed to 
the infusing in him the conviction that the british were 
decadent and fainthearted and could be provoked without impunity 
said bruno bottai the secretary general of the italian foreign 
ministry munich was also the last conference in which the 
destiny of other peoples was decided in an abstract arrogant way 
then people thought they could still solve war and peace with 
political agreements now we try to deal with this through the more 
complex mechanism of the united nations together with the concept 
of armaments reduction which is new and more complex 
sen gaetano arfe a member of the independent left who also is 
professor of history of parties and political movements at the 
university of florence said the advent of the atomic bomb marks a 
great difference between then and now 
at the time one could aim for war now this is no longer 
possible the european countries can no longer have autonomous 
foreign policies these have to lie within the systems of nato and 
the eec european economic community 
bottai said italian diplomacy at the time was against an 
excessive alignment with germany the munich conference was seen as 
a chance to widen the dialogue with france and britain he said 
unfortunately that was an illusion which lasted for a short 
time he said

half a century after the munich 
pact dismembered their country many czechs still feel they were 
betrayed by nations they thought were their allies 
british french and italian leaders joined adolf hitler in 
munich germany in september 1938 to sign a pact allowing the 
nazis to swallow the germanspeaking sudetenland the following 
year hitler occupied the remainder of czechoslovakia as well and 
the nation no longer existed 
in the history of nations there are events which even 
decades later bring about strong feelings of patriotism 
historian jan anger wrote in his book munich 1938 published in 
prague this past august 
czechoslovakias president in 1938 edvard benes had relied on 
a treaty with france and the loyalty of britain to protect his 
country from hitlers fascism 
britain and france were the countrys two main allies on which 
czechoslovakia had modeled its democracy 
in a 1947 biography of benes compton mackenzie wrote what 
finally broke benes heart was the betrayal of france 
bitter feelings have lasted long after the end of world war ii 
and the reconstruction of czechoslovakia including the 
sudetenland under communist leadership 
milos jakes who became the communist party leader in december 
said in february that the 1948 communist takeover guaranteed an 
alliance with the soviet union instead of dependence on 
imperialist states for which a tragic price was paid after 
munich 
however many czechs and slovaks have felt equally betrayed by 
their soviet allies 
many of them are younger people who are bitter about the 
sovietled invasion 30 years later to crush the prague spring 
of reforms 
on the 30th anniversary of the munich pact in 1968 
czechoslovaks were reeling from the shock of the warsaw pact 
invastion aug 2021 that crushed the reform movement of alexander 
dubcek the communist party leader at the time 
on aug 21 of this year thousands of mostly young czechoslovaks 
turned out on pragues wenceslas square to protest the 1968 
invasion an estimated 10000 demonstrators chanted dubcek and 
demands for truth and freedom 
while bitter about munich czechoslavaks see the nazi era as 
being over and west german visitors today are warmly welcomed in 
czechoslovakia 
we usually hate the most those we have loved the most and 
vice versa said one longtime political observer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
look at the eager welcome given to the thousands of west 
germans swarming the streets of prague today one could almost 
forget the way they germans came to this country 50 years ago

when the stock market acts like a bull many 
investors concentrate on capital appreciation and all but forget 
dividends 
the reason why is hardly complex since almost anyone is likely 
to be attracted to a oneday leap of 1 a share vs a dividend that 
might amount to less than that for an entire year 
but when the market stalls as it seems now to be doing 
interest in dividends returns newsletter writers tout 
highdividend stocks and brokers offer clients their lists of 
prospects for dividend increases 
when the talk is about dividends you know the spirit of the 
marketplace has changed that it has become calmer more realistic 
more attuned to economic conditions and most likely healthier 
smart investors however never lose interest in dividend 
yields even when others are talking about huge oneday profits and 
the promoters are talking about a new era and new levels of 
prosperity 
the dividend collectors however know that over the long run 
they sometimes can make more in dividends a bit at a time than 
others might make and lose in sharply fluctuating prices 
investment information services one of the newbreed market 
researchers who rely on cold hard provable data in contrast to 
the emotions promotions and shenanigans that predominated from 
1982 to 1987 offers this evidence 
over the past 38 years the total return on the standard amp 
poors 500stock index has averaged 114 percent of this 46 
percent came from dividends the rest from capital appreciation 
reinvestment of dividends over a long period of time can boost 
an investors wealth enormously little dividends become big sums 
when compounded that is when dividends reinvested earn dividends 
themselves 
if you had invested 1000 in the sampp beginning in 1926 and 
withdrawn all dividends during that time your investment would 
have been worth 19366 by the end of 1987 
but had you reinvested all the dividend payments so that they 
in turn could earn dividends your portfolio during the same time 
would have grown to 347956 
such evidence is not new but it still arrives with a shock on 
the current market scene having been scorned for years by a public 
that believed a stock puchased in the morning should show a gain by 
afternoon 
dividends cannot do that since seldom are they offered more 
than once in three months moreover you must pay taxes on 
dividends whereas you can defer any tax on capital gains until you 
sell 
there are other reasons too why dividends fall out of favor 
during bull markets chief of them being the notion that 
dividendpaying companies are too plodding too conservative too 
slowgrowing 
but when the marketplace returns to its senses as it probably 
has now the beauty of dividends returns to its proper place in 
investment philosophies

the nations automakers their regulators and 
their critics agree on this there is more to fuel economy than 
saving gasoline 
on a single mile per gallon to hear the interested parties tell 
it hangs the us trade balance the ability of the domestic auto 
industry to compete the nations energy independence thousands of 
highway traffic deaths even the capacity of the earths climate to 
support humankind 
a welter of comment offered at hearings this past week lead to 
those assorted conclusions it now falls to the national highway 
traffic safety administration to weigh those competing interests 
and issue a decision on where fuel consumption standards ought to 
be set in the future 
in many respects fuel economy is a 1970s issue hitching a ride 
on the concerns of the 1980s and the 1990s 
beginning in 1972 oil producing nations mainly in the middle 
east raised oil prices dramatically congress in 1975 responded 
with legislation to reduce the nations reliance on foreign oil by 
forcing detroit to build more fuelefficient cars 
the law phased in a minimum gas mileage each manufacturer on 
average must attain the corporate average fuel economy shortened 
to cafe and pronounced like a small eatery is calculated on the 
basis of gallons of gasoline used by a makers domestic car 
production over the estimated life of the vehicles 
the cafe standard in 1985 reached 275 mpg the next year it was 
lowered to 26 mpg by the national highway traffic safety 
administration after some of the automakers argued that for 
technological and commercial reasons they could not meet the 
stricter standard 
the standard was scheduled to revert to 275 mpg with the 1989 
model year nhtsa in august proposed setting the cafe standard 
through 1990 somewhere between 265 mpg and 275 mpg 
general motors corp and ford motor co oppose setting the 
standard at the higher end of the range they said they could live 
with a 265 mpg standard but the question is one of trade and jobs 
to meet a 275 mpg cafe standard the two largest us 
automakers said they would have to restrict production of large 
cars 
the result they said would be layoffs at largecar assembly 
plants the job losses would cascade through the manufacturers 
suppliers and into the general economy ultimately numbering in the 
hundreds of thousands 
analysts buy the argument that the stricter fueleconomy 
standard would pinch gm and ford 
i think you would have more problems because americans want 
to buy horsepower and big cars said david healy an analyst with 
the new york brokerage house drexel burnham lambert inc it 
probably wouldnt be a disaster it would be more of a pain for the 
companies than it is now 
a pain for gm and ford would be a boon for the foreign 
automakers particularly the japanese and detrimental to the us 
balance of trade both the automakers and analysts said 
large and luxury cars accounted for about 19 percent of the 52 
million domestic cars sold in the united states this year through 
august according to industry reports 
all but one of those models were made by gm and ford chrysler 
makes one big car most imported cars are smaller vehicles 
even if the us makers restricted bigcar production they 
would still make some of the highprofit vehicles thereby diluting 
the average gas mileage of their fleets 
to offset that production they have to have a lower 
performance small car than the importers because the importers 
dont have to balance their small cars aginst the higher fuelusage 
cars said thomas ogrady president of integrated automotive 
resources inc of wayne pa 
therefore even buyers of small cars would tend to gravitate to 
higherperformance imported vehicles 
against that breadandbutter question lie other issues some 
divorced from the orginal conservation intent of the law 
some want cafe loosened to lower the highway death toll the 
competitive enterprise institute a freemarket advocacy group 
argued that setting the standard at 275 mpg would lead to between 
2200 and 3900 additional deaths over the life of 1989 cars 
because people are more likely to be killed in crashes involving 
smaller vehicles 
others want the mileage standards tightened in order to protect 
the environment the energy conservation coalition a group of 20 
environmental and conservation grups argued that loosening the 
cafe standard by putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 
would accelerate the greenhouse effect a warming of the atmosphere 
caused by a trapping of the suns heat with disastrous effects for 
worlds foodgrowing ability in the next century 
the department of transportation gm and others point to 
gasoline prices averaging 97 cents per gallon far lower than 
forecast during the height of the oil crunch and say the law has 
outlived its original intent and should be scrapped 
still others such as the center for auto safety a consumers 
group often critical of the auto industry and its regulators say 
the conservation issue is still important with oil imports 
standing at 381 percent this year against 368 percent when the 
cafe law was passed a new energy crisis they argue is something 
for which the nation should be prepared 
the cafe decision the conflicting comment suggests is a 
question of public priorities a balance between the economic 
health of the auto industry and broader political safety and 
environmental concerns a ruling is expected within a few weeks

four and a half years in the chicago board of trades us 
treasury bond pit have taught tom white that the popular image of 
futures traders as overnight millionaires is a myth 
two days of playing a soybean trader in the upcoming film comedy 
limit up convinced white that his own perception of hollywood 
moviemaking was also at odds with reality 
instead of glitter and glamor white and 13 other reallife 
traders from chicago who were recruited to add authenticity to the 
production found the experience downright tedious 
youre filming 10 percent of the time and 90 percent of the 
time youre standing around waiting for them to set the cameras and 
lights white said 
and those lights were hot 
i was sweating more than i do in the pit i trade in every 
day the 29yearold independent trader said last week during a 
break from the hectic pace of the tbond arena 
hot also could describe the groups performance as soybean 
traders whipped into a buying frenzy by rumors of a large soviet 
grain purchase said director richard martini a chicagoarea 
native who also wrote the screenplay for limit up 
it just electrified everyone in the company martini 33 
said in a telephone interview from the set on the trading floor of 
the old pacific stock exchange building in los angeles 
the actors were incredibly impressed with their energy and 
what these guys do martini said some of these guys who came 
out here had traded together for 25 years and you just cant get 
that from hollywood 
martinis older brother robert a former cbot trader who served 
as a consultant on the production said the realistically raucous 
trading scenes drew wild applause from onlookers 
all sorts of heavyweights were coming over to the set he 
said theyd never seen anything like it 
the attention was welcomed by white who said he went to 
hollywood harboring a fantasy of being discovered 
im available any time for any other production for any 
film he said id gladly trade spots 
martinis previous credits include the screenplay for the 1987 
comedy three for the road and cant hurry love a 1988 
release that he wrote and directed 
limit up stars nancy allen dean stockwell saturday night 
live alumni brad hall and danitra vance and ray charles the 
movie is being produced by management company entertainment group 
inc and is scheduled for release next spring said mceg spokesman 
al newman 
the movies title refers to a sharp upward move in the price of 
a commodity traded on a futures exchange exchanges usually limit 
the amount that prices can move in either direction 
martini said miss allen plays a lowlevel employee of a trading 
company at the fictitious midwest grain exchange who sells her soul 
to the devil miss vance to become a successful soybean trader 
stockwell plays her archrival in the soybean pit and she falls in 
love with hall who plays a broker ray charles plays god 
the director said he envisions limit up as a cross between 
the christmas classic its a wonderful life and trading 
places the 1983 comedy hit about commodities trading that 
featured eddie murphy and dan aykroyd 
martini said he asked a friend at the board of trade to recruit 
some traders for his movie because he wanted to realistically 
portray the integrity of bean traders the camaraderie between 
them how they are like gladiators in the roman arena fighting 
for the world food supply 
despite such high praise the chicago contingent returned home 
with their visions of tinseltown a bit tarnished 
maybe i thought wed be involved more white lamented 
hollywoods very glamorous said victor lespinasse a 
42yearold grain trader with dean witter reynolds inc but the 
actual making of fils is very boring

the us bond market which has proven 
attractive in recent years for japanese investors showed it can be 
gracious on those rare occasions when it gets a call from a 
borrower affiliated with a japanese company 
the market provided a warm reception this past week for a 200 
million issue of threeyear notes from toyota motor credit corp 
the us finance subsidiary of the japanese automaker toyota motor 
corp 
the notes sold in denominations of 1000 were priced to yield 
8826 percent or a slim 38hundredths of a percentage point more 
than treasury securities with a similar maturity 
we were very pleased it went very well and sold out within 
one hour said wolfgang jahn vice president for toyota motor 
credit in torrance calif 
he said while the company has no specific plans for additional 
offerings he said he expects to be back 
according to the research firm securities data co the sale was 
the first straight public debt offering in the united states in 10 
years by an affiliate of a japanese company other than a bank or a 
concern controlled by the government 
the last such issue was the sale a 20 million in fiveyear 
notes by itoyokado ltd a japanese department store company in 
june 1978 according to fran wissak of securities data in newark 
nj 
mark j lerner head of the japan banking group at merrill lynch 
capital markets which led the underwriters of the issue said 
japanese companies have been deterred from the us debt market 
because of securities and exchange commission requirements 
but he said he suspects other japanese companies will be 
watching the toyota note sale and may be encouraged to try it as 
well 
a whollyowned subsidiary of toyota motor sales usa inc 
toyota motor credit makes loans to us toyota dealers and their 
customers 
it has grown rapidly over the past three years and counts over 
3 billion in accounts receivable on its books according to jahn 
jahn said the company started out raising money in the 
euromarkets because they offered ready access and cheaper rates 
initially than the us markets 
but jahn said as the companys growth accelerated it found it 
needed to return to the euromarket more frequently 
over the past three years he said toyota motor credit raised 2 
billion in 16 separate offerings and that in recent months found 
itself going back to the market with new offerings every six to 
eight months 
we realized that we couldnt raise all our funds in europe 
he said it was time for us to enter the us market 
lerner said merrill lynch worked for nine months to come up with 
documents acceptable to the company and the sec he said a 
firsttime issuer could get into the euromarkets on the other 
hand in two weeks 
nonetheless jahn said toyota motor credit wanted to make sure 
we have the capability of going into the us market to 
accommodate the companys expected growth 
it is the deepest and most liquid debt market in the world 
added lloyd misteli assistant treasurer at toyota motor credit 
lerner said he expects toyota motor credit will become one of 
the most active issuers in the us debt markets within two years 
joining a group that included the financing arms of the big three 
us automakers 
he said other japanese companies may also decide to start 
borrowing here 
the increasing frequency of japanese acquisitions in the united 
states may accelerate that development as japanese companies look 
for new sources of funds to help them finance those purchases he 
said 
now that a major leader among japanese companies has taken 
this initial step other japanese companies will follow suit he 
said

in the effort to revive the sagging securities 
markets of wall street the us economy certainly has been doing 
its part 
early this year when stocks were weighed down by fears of a 
recession the economy put on a burst of impressive growth 
now amid worries about inflation and tighter credit business 
activity appears to be obliging by slowing down to a safer more 
sustainable speed 
but the traders and money managers who make the markets go still 
seem unsatisfied and that has left many observers wondering just 
what it is the markets want 
consider the governments latest report on international trade 
which read like a prescription specifically written to cure the 
markets ills 
the commerce department figures issued on wednesday showed a 
much larger than expected narrowing in the us trade deficit to 
953 billion in july from 1322 billion in june 
in the prevailing view of things on wall street the deficit was 
headed in the right direction for the right reason an 89 percent 
drop in imports while exports continued to increase 
the implication was that the worldwide markets for goods 
produced in this country remained strong and that domestic demand 
was slowing enough at the same time to cool inflation worries 
the stock market did indeed rally on the news but the advance 
had a halfhearted ring to it the dow jones average of 30 
industrials closed wednesday with a gain of 1760 points 
by the next day the market was back in the sluggish drifting 
pattern that has predominated since midsummer 
the initial reports on the economys health in august were 
unexpectedly weak said maury harris economist at painewebber 
inc but one month is not a trend 
the erratic course of monthly data suggests it is premature to 
conclude that the economy is registering the slowdown from 
aboveaverage growth which is a prerequisite for lower interest 
rates 
similarly donald straszheim economist at merrill lynch said 
any conclusion about slower growth is probably premature 
the latest trend in data on unemployment claims straszheim 
observed suggests that employment growth will pick up in 
september and that the unemployment rate will decline 
growth in the gross national product isnt likely to slow until 
late this year he said and even then it will probably be stronger 
than the federal reserve wants to see in its campaign to restrain 
inflation 
recent indicators have delayed the next tightening by the 
fed he conceded but the fed is still likely to tighten 
further 
in the face of such restraining comments the dow jones 
industrial average settled for a 2934point gain to 209815 in 
the past week 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 197 to 15279 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market climbed 
231 to 38391 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 77 at 29822 
volume on the big board averaged 16538 million shares a day 
against 13817 million the week before 
should the economy begin a sustained slowdown that wall 
streeters accept as the real thing will that mean clear sailing 
for the markets 
perhaps analysts say but there is also the distinct 
possibility that investors will begin to worry in earnest about the 
possibility of a recession 
at some point more and more investors are likely to question 
whether the fed and other central banks can engineer an 
antiinflationary economic slowdown without bringing on a more 
serious slump 
says jeffrey applegate at the firm of tucker anthony amp rl day 
inc the extreme economic risk is recession not boom

oil futures prices declined in moderate trading 
as the market shifted its attention from hurricane gilbert to the 
oversupply of oil around the world 
on the new york mercantile exchange the october contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude settled 
33 cents lower at 1457 a 42gallon barrel friday compared with 
thursdays closing price of 1490 a barrel other contract months 
also settled lower 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery closed down 
141 cents at 4422 cents a gallon compared with 4563 cents a 
gallon on thursday the contract rose more than 3 cents on 
wednesday on fears of a hurricaneinduced gasoline shortage 
the october wholesale heating oil contract fell 133 cents a 
gallon to close at 4137 cents a gallon compared with 4270 cents 
on thursday 
analysts said the market opened lower and traded in a narrow 
range friday before weakening at the end of the day along with the 
prospects of a disruption in domestic gasoline and crude oil 
supplies in the gulf of mexico 
the market had rallied earlier in the week on reports the 
hurricane was approaching the us coastline near texas and 
louisiana and that many us refineries had ceased operations 
but by thursday analysts said the focus shifted to production 
concerns as threats of a hurricane doing serious damage dissipated 
by friday companies which had evacuated workers from oil platforms 
announced they were resuming operations 
once the hurricane is off the front pages the market will be 
back to looking at the supply and demand situation and i dont 
think that looks constructive said william byers an analyst 
with bear stearns amp co 
reports this week indicated the 13member organization of 
petroleum exporting countries had reduced its production last 
month from 20 million barrels a day to below 19 million but still 
more than the market can absorb according to analysts 
that preceded an announcement that the cartels price monitoring 
committee would meet sept 25 and 26 suggesting that opec might be 
serious about setting production limits that would strengthen world 
oil prices 
but on thursday iraqis oil minister slowed the markets upward 
momentum by announcing his country would not lower its oil output 
and might raise its production instead 
that dampens any optimism about what could come out of an opec 
meeting said john azarow an analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
iraq has refused to abide by its opecassigned quota of 15 
million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 27 
million barrels a day some observers hoped that after a recent 
ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iran iraq would join with 
other opec nations in restraining production

investors who had second thoughts after they bought gold as a 
hedge against inflation have pushed the price of the precious metal 
lower 
gold prices continued to tumble friday shedding nearly 7 a 
troy ounce the plunge brought the twoday decline in gold prices 
to roughly 18 an ounce and left gold at its lowest point since 
march 1987 
republic national bank in new york quoted gold bullion at 
41175 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt 
unlike stocks and bonds gold does not provide dividends its 
main merit is it keeps its value when paper investments are eroded 
by inflation but inflation has been lower than gold investors had 
expected 
these people are disappointed and shocked and adding fuel to 
the fire said steven pepper vice president and bullion dealer 
at republic national bank the more selling that comes in the 
more these people are in a panic 
in other markets friday stocks gained some ground and the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials rose 587 to 209815 the dollar 
was mixed and bonds drifted slightly lower in sluggish trading 
the government said friday business inventories rose in july at 
the slowest rate in 11 months an indication sales were strong 
enough to keep goods from piling up on the shelves 
the commerce department said inventories rose 03 percent the 
smallest rise since one of 02 percent in august 1987 
economists believe businesses have been intentionally adding to 
their inventories in a small way to have a buffer for continued 
strong sales 
business sales fell 02 percent in july but the decline was not 
considered worrisome because it followed a strong 14 percent jump 
in june 
when you put june and july together sales are still growing 
strongly said james annable chief economist of first national 
bank of chicago
